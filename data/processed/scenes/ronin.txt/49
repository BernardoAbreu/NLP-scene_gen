<A>__{deirdre looks at her laptop and relays gregor's instructions. she speaks over her headset as if she's conducting ordinary business as if she's giving someone traffic directs over the phone. the japanese drums continue, quiet and yet intense.}

<D>__{you want to take a left, then, so that you're going west.}
<A>__{during this next sequence, the drums will continue to play, building with the action as we do the chase montage: a series of cuts as the volvo takes a flying left turn gregor watches the target on his computer as it moves towards the promenade des anglais, typing the results on his keyboard as the volvo careens down a steep hill, hits a bump, and flies through the air a good fifteen feet, even as the fiat follows close behind and hits the same bump, does the same flight through the air and lands with a thud the caravan of cars the target car the target, still talking away on his cell phone the computer map tracking the target's movements, as the map shifts and moves as it keeps pace with the target, and now the promenade des anglais is right ahead and the drums build to a crescendo as the volvo smashes into the target car and they grind together, as cars 3 & 4 in the caravan are cut off by vincent's fiat, which forces them to slam to a halt, as larry runs the target car to a halt and the japanese drums stop. larry and swede hop out of the volvo, and swede brandishes a monster of a machine gun, with which he opens fire, a blast of huge guage shells spitting a trail of fire, smashing against the windshield of the target car, which is bullet proof. the windshield doesn't break right away but the heavy blast of firepower causes the windsield to buckle. sam and vincent are now out of the fiat, guns drawn, blazing away at bodyguards, and christ, there's an army of them, pouring out of cars 3 & 4. these guys are armed and returning fire as larry gets out of the driver's seat of the volvo, and he's got some kind of sumbitch weapons himself, a rocket launcher, which he points and fires and now we track the missle as it scorches the air, traveling towards the lead car of the caravan which has only now realized what's going on behind it, and as frantic bodyguards drive back towards the carnage the missle impacts, blowing the car sideways. meanwhile sam and vincent are taking out the other bodyguards, and these guys are warriors they moves as a team, each man with a gun in both hands, using a weapon until it's out of bullets and then discarding it in favor of a new one. and even as this is going on deirdre has joined the fray, firing both of her pistols, taking sam's place at vincent's side so that sam can run towards the target car, where the target is seated in the backseat, pulling out his own piece, ready to fight to the death himself as swede continues blasting away at the windshield with his monster gun, and now the windshield has started to crack and splinter, and abruptly, it shatters, instantly bursting a bright red as swede's bullets tear up the body of the driver. now sam has reaches the target car, just as the target, who is armed and, as we know, not exactly helpless, steps out of the car and sights in on swede and zing! sam fires, winging the target, knocking the gun out of his hand and still the target won't give up without a struggle, he hits swede with the briefcase.}
<C>__{the target}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<C>__{swede}
<D>__{not today.}
<A>__{bang. swede puts one shot between the target's eyes, ending his life. now swede takes out a dai sho, the smaller of the two traditional japanese samurai swords. with one slashing blow he hacks off the target's hand at the wrist and grabs the briefcase. the severed hand is still caught in the handcuffs, so that it is carried along for the ride. now distant sirens sound from off screen as swede moves back towards larry and the volvo, and as he goes he raises the briefcase (with its severed hand) in a kind of mock salute to sam, who starts to move back towards deirdre and vincent, who have taken care of the remaining bodyguards, and now the sirens are growing closer as we start to move in slow motion as swede approaches the volvo and deirdre and vincent are already at vincent's fiat, waiting for sam, and so they don't notice that a van has been parked nearby this entire time, and now the van's side door slides open, and unseen by any of the others gregor steps out of the van, a gun at his side, and a predatory look on his face as swede reaches larry and the volvo just as sam has reaches the fiat, and now he looks back and sees gregor, crossing the street, and now sam screams a warning to larry, but it's way too late because swede shoots larry in the neck, hitting him above the protective covering of his bullet proof vest. now we're moving in real time as larry manages to get his backup piece drawn, a snub nosed .38, and he fires all six shots into swede, hitting him in the stomach it's the same way larry shot the target in the warehouse. swede is sent flying backwards, where he crashes to the pavement. for a second we think he's dead, but then he gets up, in pain but alive, just as sam predicted. swede claws at his shirt to reveal that he too wears a bullet proof vest. by now larry has rolled out of the volvo, crawling away but too weak to go far, and now swede has larry in his sights, he's going to kill him.}

<D>__{i don't particularly like killing, tubby, but i want you to know that this one i'm going to enjoy.}

<P>__{(sees something over swede's shoulder)}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{swede turns to follow larry's gaze, and as he does gregor walks into frame and puts his gun right beneath swede's chin. before swede can even compute this, gregor pulls the trigger, firing straight up into swede's brain. then, without even looking at larry, who is lying helpless on the ground gregor takes the briefcase and gets into the volvo, driving off just as sam arrives, kneeling down by larry. the sirens get louder.}

<P>__{(in shock)}
<D>__{he just...i don't believe that son of a...}
<A>__{vincent's fiat comes peeling to a halt in front of them, vincent and deirdre inside it as sam manages to get larry into the back seat. sam doesn't get in the car yet as larry says }
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(still having trouble believing it)}
<D>__{we've been crossed...}
<A>__{the sirens reach a crescendo as a group of gendarmes arrive, charging with automatic weapons drawn. between the french cops and our heroes lies the shot up wreck of the target car, and now sam takes out a grenade, pulls the pin, and rolls it across the ground, beneath the mercedes, which the cops have just reached. seconds later the car explodes, cutting off the cops, and as this happens, vincents puts the pedal to the floor and gets the fuck out of dodge. we start to slowly pull back on the remains of this battle: the dead bodies, the shot up cars, the broken glass, and that flaming, smoking hulk of a mercedes in the middle of the street.}
