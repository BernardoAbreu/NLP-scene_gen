<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{sorry, i didn't mean to be blunt but you do. the night shifts getting to ya?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{the whole job's getting to me. my body clock's all out of whack but it's not just that. there's something seriously wrong with that place.}

<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i figure it'll wake me up a little.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{so what's wrong with the place?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{a lot of things. the way they run things for starters, the orderlies are complete bastards.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{they usually are in those places.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{some of the patients are extremely violent.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{you haven't been hurt by anyone have you?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{no, nothing like that. some of the things they say though... it's pretty frightening. the weirdest thing is... oh i dunno, maybe it's just me. i wonder if i'm seeing things.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i think the place might be haunted. either that or i'm losing my mind.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{well i wouldn't be surprised if it was haunted.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{i told my father about your new job.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{well, y'know they only built that asylum a couple of years ago?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{he says it was built on the site of one twelve ocean avenue.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{you never heard of it?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{it was a famous house. or should i say infamous. some guy shot his whole family there back in the seventies. parents, brothers, sisters. wiped out his entire family with a shotgun. then the next owners of the house only lasted there about a month. they said they were driven from the house by evil spirits. the house became known around the world. that's why the recent owners sold the land, they had enough of all the media interest and constant tourists. have you seriously never heard of the amityville horror house?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i vaguely remember hearing some stuff a while ago, but i never really took it in. i honestly didn't realise that the hospital was on the same land.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{yup, right on the spot where the house was demolished. you really think the place is haunted?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{either that or i'm going crazy.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{well you're not crazy, hun. perhaps the stories about hauntings at the house were true. maybe the house is gone but the spirits stuck around.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you believe in ghosts?}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{i dunno, never seen one. but i like to think i'm open minded. plus you're the most intelligent girl i know. if you say you've seen something, i believe you.}
<A>__{lisa smiles.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{thanks nanc.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{so what are you gonna do? are you gonna quit?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{part of me says i should. there's a lot about the place that frightens me. but i dunno... i think i've seen too much to be able to just walk away and forget the place.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{if i was you i'd just walk away. who wants to work at a place that frightens them?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{well i need the money for starters. but now it feels like i need to find out more.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{maybe you are crazy after all!}
