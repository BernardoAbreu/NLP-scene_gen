<A>__{vincent and his piece is also out the gunmen are trapped, and they know it. now we notice that the ancient geezer and his tour group are coming towards us. meanwhile, back in the tunnel sam is grilling gregor furiously, his gun still to gregor's head.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{don't talk to me unless you tell me what i want to hear, understand?!? you have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive. i want the item, and if you don't give it to me, i'm gonna kill you.}
<C>__{gregor}
<P>__{(a panicky hiss)}
<D>__{i don't have it with me...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{bullshit!}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{i swear...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{then where is it?}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{i sent it to myself in paris.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sent it where?}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{a post office box.}
<A>__{suddenly gregor runs forward, towards the exit. sam runs after him, tackling him just as they reach the outside, where the two men roll into plain sight of the gunmen, who are still covered by vincent and deirdre. now we notice that the ancient geezer and his tour group are really close, no more than ten yards away, as sam has gregor pinned face first on the ancient stone of the theater. he looks up at the others, and that's when it happens edvard looks at sam and recognizes him.}
<C>__{edvard}
<P>__{(stunned, announcing to the group)}
<D>__{do you know who he is? he's with interpol, the internation police. he's a cop.}
<B>__{a slow motion beat.}
<A>__{vincent and deirdre don't know what to make of this, their heads turn to look at sam, and in this instant the tour group walks into their midst and the 2nd gunman reaches for his piece and sam fires his gun at the 2nd gunman, and with the sharp report of the pistol we move back to real time, as the crowd panics, screaming, and now edvard is reaching for his weapon, as sam shoots again, killing the 2nd gunman, and now the crowd is still screaming and running as gregor shoves through the crowd into the exit, as deirdre pushes through the crowd, and now she's made it into the tunnel. now we go outside the theater where larry has heard the shot his piece is drawn, but he's been ordered to stay in the car. in frustration he slams on the steering wheel, as we see that behind larry, the watcher is slowly closing in, knife poised to strike as we go back }
