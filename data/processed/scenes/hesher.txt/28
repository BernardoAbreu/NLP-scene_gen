<A>__{nicole and tj are driving. they eat sour licorice. tj's not enjoying it, but not wanting her to know this.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{it's super sour isn't it? you don't have to eat it if you don't like it.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{it's really sour.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i know, that's the pointerior i used to hate this crazy sour stuff, i don't know what happened. i just recently acquired a taste for it. i don't even really know what's in it, but i pretty much eat it all the time. and i'm sure it's making me fat. i just don't want to end up like those fat old ladies you sometimes see, you know, the really fat ones?}
<A>__{tj doesn't know what to make of her.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{i don't know why i'm telling you this. anyway, i was secretly hoping that you loved these }
<A>__{holding up the licorice, then taking a bite.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{so you could eat 'em for me. but now i can see you don't like em' and i'm kinda glad cuz it means more for me. i guess i'm sort of a hypocrite in a way.}
<A>__{she smiles at that. tj attempts to smile back, but he's so confused he ends up making a strange face. he awkwardly looks away.}
