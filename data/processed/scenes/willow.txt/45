<L>__{exterior deep gorge day}
<A>__{they skid up to a perilously deep drop into oblivion. the elves are shrieking toward them. the only chance of excape is a huge fallen tree spanning the gorge. the brownies scamper out. willow looks down and reels with vertigo.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i can't go out there with the baby! rool teemo}
<P>__{(frantically point)}
<D>__{elves!!}
<A>__{the elf army pours out of the forest. willow holds his breath and ventures out onto the topmost branches of the tree. arrows zing around him as he wobbles like a drunken tightrope walker toward the middle. the brown ies wait for him.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{ohhh, i hate this.}
<C>__{teemo}
<D>__{take your time. don't worry about the elves. they won't come out here.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{rool}
<D>__{because of the trolls.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{trolls?}
<A>__{the brownies console willow with unworried laughter.}
<C>__{teemo}
<D>__{relax. they only come out at night.}
<A>__{an ugly troll snarls up behind willow. they all scream and race for the other side. another troll pops up to meet them. the trolls slink along like possums. the brownies dive through a hole in the hollow tree trunk. the elves, meanwhile, flint start a fire at their end of the tree. one troll claws at the brownies inside the trunk while the other chases willow across gangling branches. then the baby falls out of the papoose! she tumbles and catches on a low branch and willow races the troll and grabs her just before she plummets into the gorge. one troll catches rool but can't then get his claw out of the trunk. the brownies finally excape. the tree burns and breaks, dangling over the gorge by its roots. a troll howls as he falls to his death. the other scrambles up the tree and grabs willow's foot. willow's boot slips off and down goes the second troll. flames lick at willow as he at last hauls himself to safety, just as the roots snap and the blazing tree goes crashing down in the gorge.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{this is not going well.}
<C>__{teemo}
<D>__{hurry! queen cherlindrea will know what to do.}
<A>__{willow bundles the baby and follows the brownies into the forest. hobbling slightly on his bootless foot.}
