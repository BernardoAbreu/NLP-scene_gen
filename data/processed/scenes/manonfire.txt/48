<L>__{interior creasy's room sunset}
<A>__{'chopin' drifts across the courtyard. samuel is a very accomplished player. creasy sits in a chair in the twilight by the window, a glass of scotch in his hand. a knock at the door.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{the door opens. it's lisa.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{mr. creasy, i wanted to make sure you have everything you need.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{is the food alright? maria tells me that you didn't eat.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{the food's fine. sometimes i don't eat.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{it insults maria. slip it to the dog if you have to... do you mind if i talk to you for a moment?}
<A>__{he shakes his head. lisa glides into the room like a dancer, sits down at the foot of the bed.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{how are you getting along with pinta?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{we'll be okay once she realizes i'm not a new toy.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{yes, she told me. do you have children, mr. creasy?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you should know they're tenacious when they want something. and pinta wants to be friends.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{you're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. right?}
<A>__{a beat and then lisa nods.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{look. maybe this isn't going to work. maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{no, you're right. you were hired to protect her, that's enough. i'm confident you'll do that.}
<A>__{lisa stands, is about to start out when she sees his gun and holster hanging from the corner of the bed. it gives her pause. something sexy about it and creasy's proximity.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i didn't realize you had a gun. i know that's silly to say.}
<A>__{creasy doesn't answer, just watches her.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{it makes it all seem so serious.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{it is serious, mrs. ramos.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{please, it's lisa... i will be coming with you tomorrow. i have lunch with friends.}
<A>__{finally, lisa just shrugs and disappears out the door. creasy slugs down a gulp of scotch.}
