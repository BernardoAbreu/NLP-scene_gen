<L>__{interior kurtzman's office day}
<A>__{kurtzman is pacing anxiously. sam walks into the office. during the brief opening and closing of the door we just manage to hear the piano player in "casablanca" singing, "... a kiss is just a kiss ...". kurtzman is too worried to notice. he is holding a piece of paper gingerly as if it were contagious. he waves it frantically as sam enters.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<P>__{(hysterically)}
<D>__{thank god you're here! we're in terrible trouble! look at this! look at this!}
<A>__{he thrusts the piece of paper at sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(taking the paper)}
<D>__{a cheque.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{the refund for tuttle!}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{tuttle?}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{i mean, buttle! it's been confusion from the word go! he's been wrongly charged for electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i've never seen a ministry cheque before.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{we've got to get rid of it! there's been a balls up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{send it to somebody else. send it to buttle. it's his cheque.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{i've tried that! population census have got him down as dormanted, the central collective storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the information retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... security has him down as excised., admin have him down as completed}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hang on.}
<A>__{sam sits down at the console and punches keys. he does this very efficiently, muttering to himself and generally demonstrating an expertise which obviously leaves kurtzman way out of his depth, until }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he is dead.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{dead! oh no! that's terrible! we'll never get rid of the damned thing! what are we going to do?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{try next of kin.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<P>__{(a revelation)}
<D>__{next of kin!}
<A>__{sam punches more keys.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{there we go. mrs. veronica buttle. what's the number on the cheque?}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<P>__{(reading it)}
<D>__{27156789 074328 k.}
<A>__{sam has been efficiently punching this in.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{into memory. now ... central banking ... buttle, veronica ... deposit}
<A>__{sam rips off a print out, rapidly stuffs it and the cheque into a cannister and then into a vacuum tube. a job well done.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<P>__{(fervently)}
<D>__{please don't come back! please don't come back!}
<A>__{unfortunately kurtzman's prayers are not answered and the. vacuum tube returns almost immediately. sam opens it up. from the computer screen comes a voice "play it again, sam" sam and kurtzman look at the screen. we get a quick glimpse of humphrey bogart before the screen reverts to numbers.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{problem. she doesn't have a bank account.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<P>__{(hysterically)}
<D>__{well, that's it! i may as well go and hang myself! this sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! that was simmons doing! and he and jeffries always sit together at lunch! the bastards!}
<P>__{(he thumps his hand hard on the desk top)}
<D>__{ow!}
<P>__{(he picks up the offending cheque)}
<D>__{perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...}
<A>__{under this tirade sam has begun to hum "brazil" not entirely sure what inspired him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you'd never get away with it. besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. it's christmas. there is one more option.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<P>__{(depressed. not really believing it)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{drive out to mrs buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.}
<A>__{kurtzman is dumbfounded by the audacity of this.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{that's brilliant!}
<A>__{sam takes over. in no time at all he has battered away at the keyboard, slammed a cannister into a vacuum tube and received almost immediately a cannister containing a sheaf of different coloured papers.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i will do it for you. authorise the cheque. what's the address?}
<A>__{kurtzman scribbles it down for him.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{here. what do i do next?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{of course, of course. leave it to me. how do i authorize a cheque?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(separating the and blue sheets)}
<D>__{here we are. pink and blue receipts. all you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.}
<A>__{kurtzman takes out his pen and tries to sign the papers but his hand is giving him trouble.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<P>__{(exhausted after all the emotion)}
<D>__{oh god! i think i've broken a bone. what a pathetic thing i am.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(taking the pen from him)}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{sam signs the cheque and receipts. a big close up shows that he is scribbling kurtzman's signature. sam pockets the papers and the pen.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that's it.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{you are good to me sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(leaving)}
<D>__{don't mention it. see you later.}
