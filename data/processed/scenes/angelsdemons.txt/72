<L>__{ext st. peter's square night}
<A>__{ on a television monitor in st. peter's square. the reporter, a japanese woman, is giving a stand up report on the progress so far, gesturing to the chimney over the sistine chapel. the crowd has grown, now four thousand, maybe five. flashbulbs pop. a few protesters chant. almost silently, behind them all, half a dozen black alfa romeos race in, too fast, and come to an abrupt halt. in rocher's car, they all get out, trying to avoid causing a panic. langdon walks into the square, eyes focused on an object in the middle.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{another obelisk. we're close.}
<A>__{he looks up, at row after row of statues that ring the square from atop the oval colonnades. sharpshooters scurry among the statuary, setting themselves up. in the crowd, rocher mutters into his radio and to undercover swiss guard scattered throughout. the crowd is unaware of them. langdon keeps walking, turning in circles, looking above him, to the tops of the colonnades that border the square.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{there must be a hundred statues up there, which one is it?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{how in god's name would anyone make a sculpture about air?}
<A>__{and indeed there are. langdon looks at his watch. two minutes to nine. and then he freezes. staring down, not up. he takes a step back. there is a fresco carved into the square beneath his feet, or more accurately }
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{bas relief!}
<A>__{he takes a step back, to look at the carving, as does vittoria.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{the other half of sculpture is bas relief.}
<P>__{(to vittoria)}
<D>__{look for more! something having to do with air!}
<A>__{they move through the crowd, pushing people aside, causing a bit of a ruckus as they try to uncover the elaborate carvings in the stone of the square. (if we are eagle eyed, at this point we will see two robed men, one helping the other, who carries a cross, as they pass through the crowd behind langdon.) remembering something, langdon rushes forward, toward the center of the square, uncharacteristically brusque with the crowd, shoving his way through now. he draws close to one carving in particular, slows to a stop, and stares down at it, eyes wide. it's a carving of an angel's face, cheeks billowing outward as it blows a gust of wind, symbolized by five vertical streaks. its title is }
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{"west ponente." the west wind. an angel's face and five streaks. air!}
<A>__{so this is it, but now what? they look around frantically, scanning the crowd. so does rocher, so does olivetti. the bells of st. peter's start to toll the hour. nearby, a little girl dances with a doll. happily unaware of what's going on. elsewhere, some protesters tangle. some believe one thing, others don't. swiss guard and vatican police race in to break it up. but there's no bloodshed. close to that, a robed man carrying a small wooden cross falls to the ground. somebody near him screams. nearby, the little girl is jostled by a homeless man, drops her doll.}
<B>__{the robed man}
<A>__{is helped to his feet by the police. he's fine. he wanders away, holding his cross high. and as he passes us, we catch just a glimpse of his face and recognize mr. gray.}
<B>__{the little girl}
<A>__{bends down, picks up her doll, and sees it's covered in blood. she looks down at the ground, sees a trail of blood, follows it with her eyes to where the homeless man, dressed in torn rags, leans against a fountain, gasping for breath. across the crowd, vittoria and langdon hear the screams. they're closest, and they're at the fountain in just a few seconds. langdon drops to his knees, turns the homeless man over. through the man's torn shirt, he can see a black and red brand burned into his chest. three letters, ornate script, reading the same front to back:}
<C>__{air.}
<A>__{vittoria grabs his arm, feels for a pulse.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{he's still alive!}
<A>__{but the dying cardinal is gasping for breath, his mouth opening and closing like a fish on a dock. she bends down, arches his neck, closes her mouth over his, and blows air into his lungs. immediately, a fog of red mist billows from two puncture holes in the man's chest, covering langdon in blood his face, his clothes.}
<C>__{vittoria }
<D>__{his chest! they punctured his lungs!}
<A>__{langdon recoils in horror, overcome, completely out of his depth. rocher arrives, as does olivetti, as do a dozen more swiss guard and vatican police. rocher looks around, defeated and enraged, as the cardinal expires and the crowd panics, fleeing in all directions. he presses his radio to his lips and keys the mic.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{clear the square.}
