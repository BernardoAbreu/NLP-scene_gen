<L>__{interior semi derelict building operating theatre day}
<A>__{narrow shafts of light through the circular viewing window fall on an operating table, and looming pieces of discarded equipment. eerie. disturbing. harry scans the shadows as he advances into the room.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i knew you wouldn't be able tn stay away.}
<A>__{silence. harry notices the beard and glasses on the operating table.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you had to see who wept for you the most.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{a lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.}
<C>__{swann }
<D>__{they'll never find out.}
<A>__{harry looks up. svanrt is hovering in the air above him. the veins in his temples bulge and throb. this trick requires a lot of concentration.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{look, ma, no wires.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{you shouldn't have followed me, d'amour.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{how the fuck do you do that?}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{now i'm going to have to kill you.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i don't think so. you need me alive.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{why? so you can fuck my wife?}
<A>__{swann swoops down towards harry, who levels his gun.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{be careful. funerals make me trigger happy.}
<A>__{swann stops, inches from the ground.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you know, it's such a fucking waste. you can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{illusionists get. las vegas contracts, d'amour. magicians get burned.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{or murdered, like nix.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{he deserved it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{maybe he doesn't see it that way. maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now. that's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{i did it for dorothea.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{now that i'm dead, the spotlight's off her.}
<A>__{harry grabs swann, literally pulling him down to earth. now they're face to face. eye to eye. swann, for all his posturing, is afraid.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{so nix won't come looking for her?}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{it's me betrayed him.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and she shot him i i think that'd piss me off if i were nix.}
<C>__{swann}
<P>__{(despairing)}
<D>__{i don't know what else to do.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{help me.}
<A>__{on swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{listen. if he's back from the dead, then he is some kind of god. and he'll find you, wherever the fuck you are. and if he's just another phony messiah, then you can stage the greatest come back in history.}
<A>__{on swann. this doesn't sound like such a terrible idea.}
