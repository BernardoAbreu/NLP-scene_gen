<A>__{open air, the guys sit in the back. in the middle of the desert with nothing to do but wait. roque holds the deck.}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{cards.}
<A>__{the four take them. lick the back, slap them to their foreheads two deuces (jensen and roque), a three (pooch), and an eight (cougar). pitiful cards.}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{got a feeling about this one, roque.}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{your mama had that feeling too.}
<A>__{at which point, jensen pulls a knife... ...and tosses it into the center of the circle. his bet. roque responds by tossing a .357 magnum from his belt in.}
<C>__{roque }
<D>__{raise you.}
<C>__{pooch}
<P>__{(intrigued)}
<D>__{that the one with the hollow points?}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{yup.}
<C>__{pooch}

<D>__{this even me up?}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{exactly how many knives do you have, anyway?}
<A>__{jensen grins and stabs it down into the pot.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{cougar your bet.}
<A>__{the silent man stares at the others. two deuces and a three. he shakes his head at them. before he can bet...}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{hey, losers!}
<A>__{whip pan to clay. mid 30's. their leader, and you gotta be a bad ass to lead this crew. tired eyes. a weariness to him already. and hands faster than you can imagine.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it's time...}
