<D>__{this is disaster for mcavoy. after losing three shots to par in the first four holes, he should have just taken iron off the tee to get the ball in play. does he have any shot at all, gary mccord?}
<L>__{exterior fifth hole day}
<A>__{tin cup's ball lies on dirt next to the trunk of a tree. he surveys his options. behind him, wearing a headset, mccord analyzes the situation for the tv viewers.}
<D>__{mccord this is definite jail. this is life without parole. his only chance to stage a jail break is go at the ball left handed and hope he can somehow snake it back into the fairway, and save par from there.}
<A>__{tin cup glares balefully back at mccord. then he walks over to a nearby tree, and surveys the line to the green from it. he walks back for his ball, turns to mccord... and we see that familiar fierceness aflame in tin cup's eyes.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{fifty bucks says i knock it on... with a seven iron.}
<A>__{and he selects the seven iron, addresses the ball right handed, and: he swings the ball rockets low off his club, and... ... it ricochets off the trunk of a nearby tree, and... ... it bounces up the fairway, skitters past a trap, and trickles onto the green, stopping ten feet from the pin. the gallery goes crazy as tin cup steps from the woods collecting his money from mccord while jabbing a taunting finger at simms.}
