<L>__{interior front desk night}
<A>__{the last of the lovely girls arrives. she is different from the others. she looks like a farm girl, very earth mother, with a tablecloth halter top and skirt, sandals, and a simple scarf over her long dark curls. she carries two bags by herself and holds a small black pot under her arm. she is eva.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(already weary of these girls)}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, honeymoon suite.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{oh... yes... i'm late.}
<A>__{she lowers her eyes, worried.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{all right lemme give ya a hand.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{oh... no, that's all right. i can carry them by myself.}
<A>__{she is so sweet and sincere that he feels like a heel to have been irritated with her. he picks up her bags.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'm a man doin' a job no hero.}
<A>__{eva smiles, beautifully.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{well gosh thank you!}
<B>__{in the elevator}
<A>__{ted holds eva's hippy sacks as she holds her black pot. there is a shy quiet tension here.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{tell me, how long have the others been here?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{about an hour.}
<A>__{eva's heart sinks. they arrive at the door. he carries her bags in.}
<B>__{in the suite}
<A>__{the room is entirely transformed into a beautiful glowing palace with an elaborate altar, both earthly and the other earthly. the other four girls are arranging the altar as eva enters.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{you are very late, eva.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i'm sorry, athena. i was attending a birth and the placenta was late in coming.}
<A>__{ted is slightly queasy. she hands him a tip and smiles, then takes it back.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{oh, wait, lemme give you a little more than that...}
<A>__{ted's no fool, he waits while eva looks through her change purse.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{which birth is more important to you, that of a mortal or that of a goddess?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{all life is precious... but i do apologize for being late, elspeth.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{back home, they jist yank on the umbilical cord, do a karate chop on the mama's belly, and them things come right out.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{they do that here, too, jezebel, in the hospitals, but it causes hemorrhages. i fed the mother a bowl of comfrey tea and it brought the afterbirth down perfectly. the couple are going to use it for fertilizer to plant a lovely tree for their baby.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{oh wow if they were really back to nature, they'd eat it, like other mammals do.}
<A>__{close on ted's face as he gets thoroughly grossed out.}
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{in some native american cultures, they dry the umbilical cord, grind it to a fine powder, and put it in a leather pouch that the baby wears to ward off evil. but burying the placenta is also a very sound ecological practice 'cause of the oxygen it carries.}
<C>__{eva}
<P>__{(cheerfully to the others)}
<D>__{yes because you see when the placenta detaches from the uterine wall...}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(wincing in disgust)}
<D>__{uh, thank you, ladies i will be going now. if you need anything }
<A>__{eva places a nice tip in his palm.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{wait. we do need a few things.}
<A>__{ted sighs as eva enters the circle with her black pot. she kneels softly, holds her hands in piety before the altar, and softly incants as she offers her pot and places it on the altar. the stone and sword and flowers now rest here on pillows covered in chiffon scarves. the negligee hangs from the mantel, the slippers underneath as if expecting someone to materialize into the garments.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{we need fresh rosemary from the kitchen. mostly what we need is from the kitchen. hey, are you listening?}
<A>__{ted is watching eva, enchanted.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, rosemary.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{and a little bit of sea salt or kosher salt if you don't got no sea salt. a bottle of spring water italian please, not french shit.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{and some french fries!}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{kiva, shut up.}
<C>__{athena}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{and some ginger, two of the eyes of a trout fish, and a piece of raw meat, liver if you have it.}
<C>__{kiva}
<P>__{(whining)}
<D>__{i want fries you dumb jerks with your stupid fucking ritual!}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{shut up, you little shit.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{don't talk to her that way!}
<A>__{ted has scribbled down the items as she speaks. he looks at this list and these girls and shudders as he walks away. he turns, points at eva. ted smiles at this angel of a girl. she smiles back. but, as she looks him in the eyes, he feels a strange buzzing connection happening. he holds his head, almost swooning with dizziness. athena smirks.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{get to work, man.}
<A>__{ted comes out of his daze, looks at the list again and huffs off. after he goes, the girls begin to bring forth their most treasured offerings in ornate ancient bottles, vases or vials. jezebel folds her arms and clears her throat in the direction of kiva, sitting idly on the edge of the blue water jacuzzi, with her feet dipping irreverently in the water.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{kiva...}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{you have to go in the next room now.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{oh, wow, like i'm bummed out that i can't watch.}
<P>__{(whining at elspeth)}
<D>__{i'm bored!}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{up!}
<A>__{she climbs up the stairs, trying to pull the brat to her feet.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{don't put me in there by myself. i will miss you way too much.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{kiva, don't do this to me.}
<A>__{kiva sees a bit of weakening here; she takes her feet out of the jacuzzi. she begins to speak softly.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{please... if you just lemme... i will play dress up with you, the way you like it... you know what i mean... remember...?}
<A>__{elspeth begins to weaken. but continues to pull the brat up. kiva pours on softer seduction.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{we can pretend and i will do it exactly... the way you want it... with the egg whites and the kilt.}
<A>__{elspeth is now fully seduced. kiva takes elspeth's hand and presses it lightly on her face.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{you mean... like last week?}
<A>__{kiva nods. elspeth is enthralled, but from a disgusted "ick" sound from jezebel, elspeth realizes she's revealing this side of her life in front of her coven. she nervously looks around and see all the coven looking at her: a disgusted jezebel, an understanding raven, a preoccupied eva and an impatient and stern athena. elspeth comes to her senses, straightens her posture.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{we'll talk about this later, kiva.}
<C>__{kiva}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she turns on elspeth and bites her hand. elspeth pulls her arm away and grabs kiva by the hair.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{aw, really now child abuse?}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{you stay outta this!}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{i demand this stop now, elspeth!}
<A>__{elspeth lets go of kiva's hair. kiva jerks away from her.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{i'm running away from you!}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{fine. go ahead. and i will call your parole officer and she'll find you and send you back to eastlake!}
<A>__{kiva stomps off into the bedroom.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{now that the fucking melodrama is over, can we start the goddamn ritual pleeze?}
<A>__{elspeth enters the powered circle. each girl takes off her shoes. they anoint themselves with oils.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{we are communing here on new year's eve to bring to life the great goddess diana, who was turned to stone in this very room forty years ago today.}
<A>__{the girls moan in sleepy, eerie agreement as they begin to sway within the circle.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{diana, great beautiful one, we make these offerings to you, that we may undo the wicked spell which deprived you of the seed of your lover, your virginal blood, of your very life. we now form the symbolic rock with our bodies.}
<A>__{and saying this, the girls all form a "rock" with their bodies gracefully draped one upon the other. music begins, and slowly they start to unfold from the rock. the girls each find their place in a semicircle around the jacuzzi. some bare their breasts, other strip off a layer of clothes. they anoint their arms with water from the jacuzzi. they begin a lovely dance, snaking their way around the semicircle. the first one to go from one end to the other is athena. she then proceeds up the stairs and positions herself between the altar and the jacuzzi. she steps forth with a bottle to the altar and pours it into the jacuzzi.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{on this night, in this hour, we call upon the ancient power o goddess bride, i offer thee milk from a mother's sweet titty!}
<A>__{each of the girls moans eerily. athena places the bottle on the altar and bows away. she joins the circle as elspeth now steps forward with her offering in a vial.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{to reverse the evil which has been done i make this offering to the divine one a whore not, an innocent was, for whom i seized a virgin's blood.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{goddess of light, goddess of lust, to undo this awful spell is a real must. to bring you life and get you high i offer the sweat of five men's thighs.}
<A>__{the girls moan loudly as they sway. jezebel places her offering in the hot tub and bows out, returning to the circle. now raven comes forth with a small leather canteen. she unscrews the lid as she offers in her opiate stupor.}
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{diana, oh great one, we live without sun until this wicked curse is undone. in hope that you live, and to us appear, i have collected a year's worth of tears.}
<A>__{she pours liquid into the mix, as the witches moan. now it's eva's turn. eva continues to sway, not moving forth to the altar. the girls keep their eyes closed as they sway, waiting for eva's offering. athena finally gives her a push and she goes. eva kneels before the altar. she produces a silver bottle with a chain on its cap and neck. she timidly begins to incant.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{great goddess diana, fail you i will, i was to bring fresh sperm from my bill. i had him erect, and his semen would follow but alas i was hot, so hot that i swallowed.}
<A>__{the moans turn to wails as the girls gasp and shriek! athena opens her eyes, wildly.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{you stupid little witch! you swallowed the sperm! aye yi yi!}
<A>__{elspeth opens her eyes and folds her arms, smirking bitterly.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{it just shows what an amazing lack of control you have over yourself, eva!}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{honey, why didn't you just use your hands? didn't your mama teach you not to put them things in your mouth?}
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{i understand though...}
<A>__{eva bursts into tears. athena is firm.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{there is no time to cry over swallowed sperms. you're gonna have to get some, baby. you have one hour to prove what kind of witch you really are.}
<A>__{just then: a knock at the door.}
<C>__{athena}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{what do you want?!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{ted... the bellboy.}
<A>__{athena smiles and turns to eva.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{mr. bellboy, come right in!}
<A>__{ted opens the door. his eyes bulge out as he looks upon the fleshly feast. he steps back. they giggle seductively, all except eva, who sniffles, red eyed. amazingly, ted's attention is captivated by eva's sorrow, not by the naked charms of the other witches. she shyly covers her breasts. sensitive to her shame and sorrow, he looks away and steps from the door to fetch the room service cart. athena directs the others to put on their shirts. ted wheels in the cart.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{here's the things you asked for. oh, and uhh, sorry, but i'm not gonna pick the eyes outta this dead fish.}
<A>__{he points to the trout. elspeth picks it up, flings the eyes into the jacuzzi, and tosses the trout out of the window. she smirks at him comtemptuously.}
<C>__{athena}
<P>__{(handing ted 50 bucks)}
<D>__{okay, mister, here's your fifty dollar tip, only, you have to do one more thing... make our little eva smile. can you? we'll leave you alone.}
<P>__{(to eva, firmly)}
<D>__{and don't use your mouth!}
<A>__{the girls step out. athena turns to eva and points to her watch, then holds up one finger. eva looks up, worried. the door closes on her and ted. she looks at ted and sighs. he covers her with a shawl.}
<B>__{in the hallway}
<A>__{the other witches listen at the door.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{if she doesn't get his goop in ten minutes, i'm going to take him myself.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{ha! that'll be a first for you.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{oh shit kiva!}
<A>__{she runs back in for her bratty girlfriend, who is already sneaking out the bedroom door.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{and just where do you think you're going?}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{well, gawd i need a candy bar or something you haven't fed me all day. i'm getting all shaky. my blood sugar's really low.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{elspeth honestly now some babysitter you're turnin' out ta be!}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{enough, girls. i will collect fresh earth. jezebel, i want you to gather damp moss. raven, you bring me a birch branch.}
<A>__{elspeth, you go feed your terrible girlfriend. we meet back here in one hour and let's all have faith that eva can get this guy off. the witches disperse.}
