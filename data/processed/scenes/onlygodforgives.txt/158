<L>__{exterior restaurant night}
<A>__{the driver of the crappy van smokes nervously in the driving seat as he waits. as soon as he sees gunman three, panic stricken, running in fear, he puts the van in gear, revs the engine and starts to pull away. gunman three runs after him, crying out for him to slow down. the driver slows. gunman three struggles to jump into the open doors. chang bursts out of the restaurant. stops dead. aims and fires off two rounds. blood spatters across the inside of the windscreen. the driver falls forward, dead. the back door of the van slams shut. gunman three thinks he's made it. he's wrong. the van isn't going anywhere. chang approaches the back door of the van, ready to fire.}

<D>__{i know that. you're wearing sandals. hitmen don't wear sandals.}
<A>__{the door opens. sandaled feet step out of the van. gunman three comes out with his hands up, falling to his knees. chang continues to point his weapon at the unarmed man.}

<P>__{(in thai)}
<D>__{give me a reason.}
<A>__{the cops appear behind him in the doorway. chang holds his ground. his finger twitches. it looks like he's going to pull the trigger.}
