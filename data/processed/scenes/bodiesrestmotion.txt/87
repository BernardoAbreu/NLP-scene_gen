<L>__{interior beth's bedroom morning}
<A>__{sid is sprawled out over the bed, sleeping, beth nestled against him. she stirs and cuddles closer. suddenly she realizes it's not nick. she pulls away, orientating herself. she quickly scoots out of bed and hurriedly pulls on a pair of jeans. the alarm clock clangs. beth looks about for the alarm. she tensely scatters some boxes. she dumps one, finds the alarm and shuts it off. she stares at the clock and drops it into a box.}
<C>__{sid }
<P>__{(cheerfully)}
<D>__{morning.}
<A>__{beth cringes slightly and turns to face sid.}
<B>__{sid and beth}
<C>__{beth}

<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i didn't want to wake you.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(cheerfully)}
<D>__{i'm awake. i'm a morning person.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i'm not.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{then why don't you come back to bed?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i've got to pack.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(sitting up)}
<D>__{where do we start?}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(softening)}
<D>__{you painterior}
<A>__{she looks around the room littered with boxes and piles of clothes.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i will manage.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(cheerfully)}
<D>__{whatever you say.}
<A>__{sid gets out of bed, wrapping the sheet around himself. beth stares at the room. she suddenly trembles. she steadies herself on the bed table.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{oh god...}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{beth avoids his eyes, glancing around the room.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(an outpouring)}
<D>__{i'd be so much happier if i could blame this on nick, but it always happens to me. i'm always left with nothing.}
<P>__{(taking a deep breath)}
<D>__{it doesn't matter if i leave the guy or if the guy leaves me i'm left with nothing. i never do anything for myself. i never acquire anything. i mean nick didn't take from me. he stole a t.v. and left it for me. he didn't take my things, he didn't take our things... he didn't even take his clothes! and i will still leave this house with nothing!}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{he took three years from you.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no...}
<P>__{(meeting his eyes)}
<D>__{he didn't take 'em. i mean, when he cared about me, he cared about me. and he was really good in bed.}
<A>__{she glances away from sid toward the bed.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{i didn't expect more.}
<A>__{she turns away from sid and the bed. sid moves toward her.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{beth...}
<A>__{beth summons up all the composure she can manage.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(referring to the cluttered room)}
<D>__{i can't face this.}
<P>__{(looking to sid)}
<D>__{i'm gonna finish up the kitchen...}
<P>__{(heading for the door)}
<D>__{...get some momentum...}
<A>__{she goes out the bedroom door. sid stares after her.}
