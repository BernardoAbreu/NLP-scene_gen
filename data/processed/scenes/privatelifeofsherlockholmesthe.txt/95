<L>__{interior tent night}
<A>__{it is lit by a kerosene lamp suspended from the ridge pole. there are several cots, one of them with the bedding rolled up. resting on the stripped cot is a trunk with the name e. valladon painted on it. lying on a table, among a group of engineering models, are gabrielle's parasol and watson's stethoscope. there are also a couple of drafting tables, with plans and blueprints tacked to them. holmes moves around the tent, taking all this in.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{interesting and educational.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{despite my most emphatic warning, you persisted in meddling. it would have served you right if you'd all drowned.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{sorry to be so unobliging.}
<P>__{(stops beside torch)}
<D>__{e. valladon... h'mm.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<P>__{(indicating parasol and stethoscope)}
<D>__{i imagine this belongs to the pretty lady, and this belongs to your valet... we found them floating in the lake.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{speaking about things floating in the lake }
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{how much do you know or think you know?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i think you're testing some sort of underwater craft camouflauged to mislead the gullible. i think it's an experimental model, operated by a crew of midgets. i think it is powered by sulphuric acid batteries, and uses canaries to detect escaping gas... altogether a strange contraption.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{not quite that unique. right now, four countries are trying to develop what we call a submersible. but none of them could solve the critical problem how to stay submerged long enough to make it effective.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{what does the good book say? "and jonah lived in the belly of that fish for three days and three nights."}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{that was our goal. and thanks to valladon's air pump, we got a jump on the rest of them. it's a highly complex system of filtration so we had a series of trials }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{and at least one error.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{during a test run in moray firth, pressure caused a leak in the hull. sea water mixed with the acid in the batteries to produce chlorine gas. before they could reach the surface, valladon and the crew were dead.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{so you had them buried in unmarked graves, to preserve your secret.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{it was essential to keep the information from your client.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you went to all those lengths to prevent madame valladon from fiding her husband?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{your client isn't madame valladon it's the imperial german government. they were after the belgian engineer or rather, his invention. they knew he was employed by us, but they couldn't find out where so they enlisted the best brain in england to help them. you, my dear brother, have been working for the wilhelmstrasse.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{and madame valladon what part did she play in all this?}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{madame valladon is dead.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{dead?}
<A>__{mycroft crosses to the trunk, opens the lid.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{the germans disposed of her three weeks ago, in brussels. this is gabrielle valladon.}
<A>__{he hands holmes a small, framed photograph. holmes looks at it with apprehension, as well he should: the picture is of a somewhat matronly woman, not the glamorous gabrielle. holmes lowers the photograph. behind it, mycroft is glaring at him with customary arrogance.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{the woman who was brought to your house in the middle of the night apparently fished out of the thames and apparently suffering from amnesia is, in fact, ilse von hoffmanstal, one of their most skillful agents. am i going too fast for one of the "best brains in england?"}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{go on.}
<A>__{as mycroft continues, holmes picks up ilse's water soaked parasol and examines it.}
<C>__{mycroft}
<D>__{they planted her on you quite neatly, i must admit, so that you could lead them to their objective, the air pump. very much like using a hog to find truffles. and now perhaps you'd care to join me. i am expecting a certain royal personage from balmoral.}
