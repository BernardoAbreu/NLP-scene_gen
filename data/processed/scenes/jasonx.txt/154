<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{boeman and the other start tearing the debris out of the way!}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{hurry! she's lost it!}
<C>__{janessa}
<D>__{so what else is new?}
<L>__{interior lab one}
<A>__{boeman climbs through a hole in the rubble. he grabs the lever.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{boeman don't. you know i'm right.}
<C>__{janessa}
<D>__{are you crazy?! pull the lever!}
<A>__{boeman yanks the lever. as the others climb into the lab }
<C>__{computer voice}
<D>__{depressurization inconclusive. kay em 14 we've lost too much pressure. an hour, tops.}
<C>__{janessa}
<P>__{(to rizzo)}
<D>__{you happy? you've killed us all!}
<A>__{thorgan rushes over to the big nano tech machine. places his broken arm on the slab. the machine quickly goes to work. a schematic of his arm appears on the wall. janessa stares at him.}
<C>__{janessa}
<D>__{what's the point?}
<A>__{delongpre shrugs.}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{so that's it then.}
<A>__{it seems it is. janessa stands over yllo's decapitated body. it's obvious their relationship went beyond just teacher student. there is a loud metallic whine from the ship's hull.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{that's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship. kay em 14 no...}
<P>__{(signing)}
<D>__{that's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{are there any other shuttles?}
<C>__{janessa}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{teleportation? some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{you read a lot of science fiction didn't you?}
<C>__{janessa}
<D>__{a little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it? kay em 14 i will never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a knofflapod. damn.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{am i in there? kay em 14 sory...}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{that's a good fantasy, though. kinky, but good.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{hey!!}
<A>__{all heads turn to rizzo. she's staring at a schematic of the ship. the left hull of the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the various system failures. rizzo points to the right hull.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{it's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.}
<A>__{rizzo points at the thin walk ways connecting the two hulls.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{can we get through these?}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{sure but what good will that do?}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{when the left hull goes, so will the right.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{what if we blow the walkways first? leave jason over here to go up with the ship?}
<A>__{they stare at her.}
<C>__{janessa}
<D>__{you know, yllo seemed to think we could catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth millions.}
<A>__{the others stare at her as if she were crazy.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.}
<C>__{janessa}
<D>__{i'm just saying.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<P>__{(to others)}
<D>__{come on. you got all these gadgets and shit. why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{we'd need charges.}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{we could convert fission transistors.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{we're not supposed to do that.}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{what are you gonna do, tell me?}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{the engine room will have molecular welders. we could seal up the hull.}
<A>__{a moment of consideration. could this actually work?}
<C>__{janessa}
<D>__{yeah, great idea! and i will keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{would you? kay em 14 now this is getting exciting.}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{remember to roll his balls around a bit.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{you got a better plan?}
<A>__{obviously they don't. they got to work. boeman grabs a number of devices from under a cabinet.}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{i will need system four converters.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{they're back here.}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{bring 'em all. let's move!}
<A>__{thorgan's still hooked up to the nano tech machine.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{hey! i'm not ready.}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{then you better hurry. i will blow alley one, delongpre, you and rizzo take there. janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.}
<C>__{janessa}
<D>__{you're so bossy.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{you're leaving me here alone?}
<A>__{delongpre tosses the chaingun next to him.}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{don't blow your foot off.}
<A>__{they climb through the hole in the corridor and disappear.}
<D>__{kay em 14 it's just you and me, then.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{come here, might as well fix that arm.}
