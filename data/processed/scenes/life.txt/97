<L>__{exterior baseball field day}
<A>__{a plump pig roots about in a small pen. a sign dangles from a post "first prize." the incorrigibles of camp 8 limber up for the big game with the inmates of camp 12 across the field.}
<C>__{poker face}
<D>__{think you can handle something that big, cookie?}
<C>__{cookie}
<D>__{i handled your mama, didn't i? don't y'all worry. i got plans for that bad boy. ain't none of him going to waste.}
<A>__{beyond the fence, a late model sedan rolls up. stan blocker, in a straw hat and a rumpled suit, climbs out and stretches his legs. irritated, he smacks a mosquito and exchanges a few words with dillard.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{banks! get over here!}
<A>__{claude hustles over, removing his hat.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{this is stan blocker. scout for the nigger leagues.}
<C>__{blocker}
<D>__{negro leagues, actually. pittsburgh crawfords. ever hear of us?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{we get the games on the radio sometimes.}
<C>__{blocker}
<D>__{we played down in jackson yesterday. heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you probably mean can't get right. that's him over there.}
<C>__{blocker}
<D>__{can't get right? that's the kid's name? can i talk to him?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you can try, but you won't get too far. why you interested?}
<C>__{blocker}
<D>__{crawford's are always looking for new talent.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.}
<C>__{blocker}
<D>__{there are ways around that. right sergeant?}
<A>__{blocker winks at dillard, then glances at the incorrigibles practicing in the field. goldmouth, cookie, poker face, biscuit they don't exactly inspire confidence.}
<C>__{blocker}
<D>__{nice looking squad. see you after the game.}
<A>__{blocker takes a seat on the bench.}
