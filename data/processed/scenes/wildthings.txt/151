<L>__{exterior ocean day}
<A>__{from the surface of the sea the emerald island in the distance. the bow of the sloop comes into frame. on board sam stands in the cockpit, at the helm. ray lounges on the deck. the boat sails easily before the wind.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{ray... you see that winch by your head? take a couple of turns on it for me, she's luffing.}
<A>__{ray cranes his neck to look at the winch.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you mean this thing?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes, we call it a winch.}
<P>__{(pointing at pieces of the rigging)}
<D>__{and these are shrouds, and these are stays.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i thought this was supposed to be a vacation. why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{come on, man. i will make a sailor out of you yet.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah, or get me drowned.}
<A>__{ray kneels. he begins to tighten the winch. sam watches him for a moment, then reaches around behind his back to unhook the short line which holds the boom. the mainsail catches wind, swinging the boom in a wide arc, directly at ray. ray looks up, sees it coming just in time to catch it on his arm. the blow is enough to send him sprawling through the lifelines, where he just manages to grab one of the nylon cords. sam ducks as the boon continues to swing erratically above the deck, watching as ray hauls himself on board. the boat no longer driven by the wind, bobs up and down on a small ground swell. the two men face each other.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{jesus, man... you okay?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that how you planned it? you take cut suzie, get me to hang it on kelly, then dump me in the ocean...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{come off it, man... it was an accident.}
<A>__{ray nods, then reaches down, pulls off the winch handle and starts with it toward sam. sam looks around. he jerks open a storage compartment. a diver's weight belt tumbles out. sam grabs it, swings it over his head in circles, letting the weight pick up momentum, preparing to throw. ray crouches, still brandishing the winch handle. the boom sweeps the deck. sam throws the belt. ray grabs a shroud, dances out of the way, then steadies himself, a mean grin spreading across his face. there's no tine for sam to look for anything else. ray moves quickly across the deck a menacing sight tall, well muscled, the handle gleaming in his hand. sam pulls himself out of the cockpit. ray jumps in. but that's as far as he gets. whoosh a spear pierces ray's thigh. he screams, goes down, the handle skittering across the deck. ray follows it with his eyes, reaching out, then freezing as he sees something else. he draws in his hand as if bitten.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you... you're...}
<A>__{he scuttles backward, pulling himself onto the deck, clutching at his leg which squirts blood as if an artery has been severed. but his eyes never leave the hatchway leading belowdecks.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{you're dead... for godsake...}
<A>__{the boat heels over. the spear in ray's thigh bangs against the edge of the cockpit. he grimaces in pain as... suzie toller steps up from belowdecks. she's wearing a bikini and showing a nice tan. she's carrying sam's new spear gun, a fresh spear at the ready.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{nice move. good thing i was here to save your incompetent ass.}
<A>__{sam secures the boom. ray stares at suzie, his face twisted with some combination of pain, rage and fear.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you... i should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{shoulda, coulda, woulda...}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{get him in the water.}
<A>__{san starts for ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{sam, for christ's sake...}
<A>__{sam's feet slide in the bloody smear. he stops. ray clings to a safety line.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i can't.}
<A>__{whoosh a second spear penetrates ray's shoulder. he loses his grip. the boat heels over, dumping ray into the water. suzie puts down her spear gun. she goes to a storage locker, takes out a bait bucket. she steps up on the deck. ray is floating not far from the boat, the water going red around him. he calls out...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{sam, for godsake.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{hey, ray. guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and sam's?}
<A>__{she raises the bucket, heaves bloody chum into the water.}
<C>__{suzie }
<D>__{i like these joint survivorship accounts. something unfortunate happens to one of the signatories, the others don't have to worry. are you worrying, ray?}
<A>__{she heaves more chum a big red slurp across ray's face. ray gasps, goes under, thrashing around in the red slick.}
<C>__{suzie }
<D>__{men, use 'em abuse 'em lose 'em.}
<A>__{insert sharks from underwater, in a frenzy, rip a human body into a bloody cloud.}
