<C>__{sibeal}
<D>__{well, are ya at least gonna try ta talk them out of this?}
<A>__{poppa m shakes his head.}

<D>__{we don't even know what this is yet! somebody could just be tryin' ta get away with murder here!}
<C>__{poppa m}

<A>__{the door opens and in comes connor and murphy. sibeal notes the change in appearance. the boys stand at the kitchen table's opposing end, hands in their pockets. their resolve fills the room. the brothers face off with poppa m and sibeal: a bizarre board meeting. poppa m cocks a brow at sibeal who clears his throat.}

<A>__{silence. nobody moves. connor withdraws a hand from his pocket and looks down. he flips a penny on the table. it clatters to a stop.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{every last motherfucker that had anything to do with it.}
