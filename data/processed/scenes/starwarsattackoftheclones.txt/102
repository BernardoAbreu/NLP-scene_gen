<L>__{exterior geonosis, landing area night}
<A>__{obi wan's ship skims across the top of a small mesa along the edge of a rocky ridge. he maneuvers under a rock overhang and lands. he gets out of the fighter and walks onto the mesa. the wind whips at him. he looks around. geonosis is a red rock planet, featureless apart from buttes and mesas, and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on the arid plains. the night is quiet, except for an occasional weird cry. obi wan checks his bearings, then heads away.}
