<A>__{will opens the screen door with a creak. steps into the living room. recoils from the smell. flies buzzing. yellow plastic covering the sofas. boxes, books, papers, pictures piled high everywhere. wallpaper faded, peeling. everything, decaying.}

<A>__{ellie ripping along the forest road in her truck. gripping the wheel. the photograph pieces, taped together on the passenger seat.}
<L>__{interior summer house continuous}
<A>__{will heads down a hallway. dark, narrow, floorboards worn. more shit stacked up. each step, careful, quiet. tracking. listening. a breeze sweeps through. the burned out lightbulb hanging from the ceiling, starts swinging.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{here to visit me?}
<A>__{will whips around. walter standing there. at the other end of the hallway. shoulders slumped. will shakes his head.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{flies, bouncing against the screen door.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{i'm here to end this.}
<A>__{walter looks around.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{where's your back up?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no back up.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you're not following procedure.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{procedure went out the window a long time ago.}
<A>__{walter looks at him.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{we're on the same side, will. you know that. after what we've been through together. we're partners. bound by a secret.}
<A>__{will takes a step forward...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's where you're wrong, walter.}
<A>__{slowly reaches into his jacket...}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{there is no secret. because the biggest difference between you and me is what we will or will not live with...}
<A>__{pulls out his smith and wesson. walter. looks at the gun. inches back.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{will...}
<A>__{suddenly, darts out of sight. swings back into the doorway with a shotgun... bam! will's shoulder explodes with blood.}
