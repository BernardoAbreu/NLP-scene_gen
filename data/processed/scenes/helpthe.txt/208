<A>__{skeeter smiles as she reads from a book in her corner office. the manhattan skyline rises behind her. she wears pucci. her hair is perfectly styled. she looks gorgeous. she sets the book down on her desk and picks up the phone. the book's cover reads:}
<D>__{"all my babies" by aibileen clark}
<A>__{next to the book is a glass box. constantine's corn pipe rests inside. aibileen's new home living room fifteen years later aibileen, 70, rises from a sofa. her hair is gray. reading glasses hang on a chain from around her neck. as she begins a slow walk down the hall, we see the surroundings of her new home for the first time. it's much bigger, well furnished and beautiful. she passes a study lined with shelves of books. a copy of "the help" and "all my babies" are placed side by side. at the end of the hall, aibileen approaches the opened door of a brightly lit, sparkling white, bathroom. she enters the bathroom and closes the door.}
