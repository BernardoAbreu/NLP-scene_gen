<L>__{interior supermarket canned goods aisle day}
<A>__{tj is hiding, peering down an aisle, watching nicole working at the check out scanning groceries. a can falls from one of the shelves just in front of him. it startles him. and then another one falls. he steps along the shelf to where the cans fell. he looks through to the next aisle. nothing. then a voice from behind him.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{do you think she is totally bald or do you think she's more of a landing strip kind of chick or more of a 70's jungle bitch.}
<A>__{tj is startled. hesher stands behind him, also watching nicole.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{what are doing here?}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{you're stalking that chick, dude.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{no, i'm not.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{yeah, you are. i've been stalking you for half an hour. you gonna try to fuck her?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{what? no.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{can't fuck her from here, dude. gotta be way closer.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{shut up about it.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{you wanna poke her clam?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{tj is freaked and embarrassed. he walks away down the aisle. hesher follows.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{you wanna poke her clam or what?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{please stop saying that.}
<A>__{tj walks ahead fast. he wants out of this conversation. nicole finishes up, turns her light off and hangs a 'check stand closed' sign. she walks off toward the back of the store. tj stops to be sure to avoid her.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{you want to poke her clam, dude. nothing wrong with that. don't be ashamed about it. humans have been poking vagina for hundreds of years. longer even.}
<A>__{hesher says this a little too loud. nearby shoppers look over. tj shakes his head, then exits the store. hesher follows.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{bro, there's nothing wrong with wanting a little pussy.}
