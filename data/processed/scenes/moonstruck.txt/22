<B>__{music}
<A>__{vicki carr is singing "it must be him." the front hall is typical of big old brownstones. there's a big old oak coat rack with a built in mirror and an umbrella stand. there are several coats hanging from it. the floor is littered with boots. there's also a side table. on the table is a large cut glass bowl filled with a couple of pounds of hard candy. loretta comes in and takes off her coat. a single mad howl is heard, followed by a pandemonium of barking. five dogs charge into the hall to greet loretta. they are totally cockeyed, crackpot mutts. their names are judas, lucy, leo fatboy, and jones.}

<D>__{how long must i wait? quanto tempo devo aspettare?}
<A>__{the five dogs turn away from loretta and charge up the stairs toward the voice. loretta walks toward the living room.}
