<A>__{clothing everywhere. israel's top dollar wardrobe, designer suits, wadded up into balls and stuffed into a garment bag. he's doing more cocaine, talking to himself, babbling the classic addict's "don't worry it'll to be alright" monologue.}

<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{ivy! why isn't hugo at the airport!? it's a fifteen minute trip!}
<A>__{ivy, his menace gone malignant, quietly stepping out of the shadows...israel has no idea that he's been there all along.}
<C>__{israel }
<P>__{(turning back to ivy)}
<D>__{well what the fuck!? i got the doc in town, i need him here! call hugo, find out where the car is!}
<A>__{ivy doesn't budge, just stands there, staring hard.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{so what'd mecklen have to say?}
<A>__{israel stiffens, board straight, the guilt goosing him. ivy turns the burners slow.}
<C>__{israel}

<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{but it's all good right?}
<A>__{israel almost chokes on his own smile, nodding.}
<C>__{sir ivy}
<D>__{so we're all traveling together, getting sworn, giving our statements }
<A>__{israel starts zipping up some of his bags.}

<D>__{ i dunno the way it's gonna play out, but yeah, it'll probably go something like that.}
<A>__{ivy unbuttons his coat. a .50 cal rides in his shoulder rig. israel averts his eyes. ivy lets the moment load up...then;}
<C>__{sir ivy}
<D>__{you believe in loyalty, don'tcha?}
<P>__{(pause, then)}
<D>__{'specially the kind of loyalty where an otherwise sensible motherfucker puts his own best interests aside to selflessly serve another. 'cuz outside a goddamn dog, that kinda loyalty, my kinda shit, don't get any more dedicated, or deep, or devout...}
<A>__{israel, unnerved now spots a small handgun sticking out of his bag. he covers it with the bedspread, looking up at ivy.}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{...what are you tryin' to say?}
<C>__{carruthers }
<D>__{what i've been saying. get me your head of security right now.}
