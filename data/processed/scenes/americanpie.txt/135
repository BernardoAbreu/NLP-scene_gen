<L>__{interior vicky's bedroom day}
<A>__{vicky is doing calculus homework, as kevin looks on, rubbing her shoulders.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{you're not doing the extra credit problems.}
<C>__{vicky}
<D>__{no, i'm not. i'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like i'm doing the extra credit problems. mr. bender doesn't bother to check homework past april.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{that's my trick!}
<C>__{vicky}
<D>__{it's everyone's trick, kevin.}
<P>__{(she turns to him)}
<D>__{but i did pick it up from you.}
<A>__{she gives him a little kiss on his hand, continuing with her work. kevin keeps rubbing her back, more serious.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{we've come a long way since homecoming.}
<C>__{vicky}
<P>__{(playful)}
<D>__{yeah, we have. you corrupted my four point into a three nine five.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{indeed i did. but, our relationship. it's progressed a lot. it's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.}
<A>__{vicky stops working and turns, sitting up on the desk, facing him. her mood has shifted, more romantic.}
<C>__{vicky}
<D>__{like how?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{well, i feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. when two people share...a special moment between them.}
<C>__{vicky}
<D>__{i think you're so right, kevin.}
<C>__{kevin}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you want to do it?}
<C>__{vicky}
<D>__{yes }
<A>__{she takes his hand. readies herself, and declares.}
<C>__{vicky }
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{kevin falters. this is definitely not what he was expecting. he's caught. trying to formulate a response.}
<C>__{vicky }
<D>__{kevin? do you not love me?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{no, i don't not love you. i like, i know that we've definitely got something between us. something good. something special.}
<C>__{vicky}
<D>__{but you don't love me.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i didn't say that. i mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. people say things, they get married, have kids, and then what? it's like they call it off, going "i was wrong."}
<A>__{a beat. vicky seems to know where he's coming from.}
<C>__{vicky}
<D>__{kevin...you're not your dad. the two of us, we're not your parents.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i know, vick. i'm just not ready yet, okay?}
<C>__{vicky}
<D>__{okay.}
