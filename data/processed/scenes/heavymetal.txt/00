<A>__{a beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun. as the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll. ahead of us an odd looking service van comes into view, sputtering along a dirt road. getting closer, we can see the driver, a thin, bookish man with a neat mustache. this is austin grimaldi. the truck pulls up to a strange victorian house in the middle of the wheatfield. the house has several futuristic radar devices on the roof that rotate constantly. austin gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out two large metal boxes.}
