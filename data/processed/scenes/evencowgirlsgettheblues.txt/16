<D>__{i will send this out to sissy, she should get it in a week, and you will be able to meet her. when i send a letter to sissy, duplicates must be sent to u.s. post office boxes in laconner, taos, pine ridge, cherokee and that other place, for her to pick up... why she's probably out there right now in hibbing, minnesota, or deluth, montana... hitching her way across the country.}
