<L>__{exterior desert valley day}
<A>__{the high desert absolutely silent a vast, hard land scape stretching away to distant mountains. the silence is broken by hoof beats.}
<L>__{exterior edgar's place day}
<A>__{it's a simple cabin dwarfed by a big, ramshackle barn. edgar deems (60s), a weathered desert rat of a hermit, is walking his donkey around in circles. now, rattling toward them down an endless dirt road, comes an old, sun bleached buick. it stops and out leans old fred (70s) wearing a sweat stained fedora. the two friends nod.}
<C>__{old fred}
<D>__{how's she doing?}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{she wants to lay down. i'm a little worried.}
<A>__{old fred climbs out with a bushel basket of carrots.}
<C>__{old fred}
<D>__{well, i brung her something i know she likes.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{damn, fred, you can't give away all those.}
<C>__{old fred}
<D>__{forget it. i got vegetables coming out my ears. usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately i ain't so much as seen a gopher or a jack rabbit nowheres.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{if that ain't the truth. and i count on them for a little bit of stew meat...thank you, fred.}
<A>__{edgar takes the carrots and feeds one to the donkey.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{here you go, justine. look what fred brought you.}
<C>__{old fred}
<D>__{we playing cards tonight?}

<C>__{old fred}
<D>__{i'd do the same. well, catch you thursday.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{you bet.}
<A>__{the men nod, and old fred drives off. close up of the donkey's hooves thumping along as edgar leads her to the barn.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{let's get you out of the sun for a spell.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{i will get you some fresh water.}
<A>__{but, suddenly, we hear the donkey restlessly stomping its hooves and braying. edgar turns, concerned. now we hear an odd sound. distant thunder? the wind? the donkey gets more and more frantic. the barn shudders violently. frightened birds explode from the eaves. dust puffs from every old seam. roof shingles rain down. edgar stares in amazement.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{...some kind of earthquake !?}
<A>__{then another sound the donkey starts screeching in wild panic.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{justine, hang on! i'm coming!}
<A>__{edgar races back to the barn and flings open the doors.}
