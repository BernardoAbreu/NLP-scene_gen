<A>__{renee's corpse on a slab is rolled into an examining room by an attendant. the entrance of the body is shown reflected in a chrome framed mirror that juts out from a tile wall. the attendant prepares for the impending autopsy, laying out a rack of instruments, positioning the corpse. as he is doing these things, the medical examiner enters, accompanied by his girlfriend. the m.e. is dressed formally, in a tuxedo. the young woman is wearing a slinky dress with a fur wrap, pearls, spike heels. the couple are close; she has an arm through his, and she laughs, nervously. he is smoking a cigarette.}
