<A>__{the dancers. their movements are loose and getting looser. the music is strong and insistent. the smokey atmosphere disfigures the dancers and gives them a strange, distorted appearance. suddenly jezzie breaks from the crowd and reaches for jacob. he pulls away. some of the male dancers call out to him.}
<C>__{dancers}
<D>__{come on man, show your stuff.}
<A>__{jacob is easily intimidated. relenting, he glares at jezzie and nods apologetically to elsa. it is obvious that he is embarrassed at his inadequacy on the dance floor.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{come on professor. you got feet, too.}
<A>__{jacob tries to smile but it is pained and unconvincing. jezzie is playing with him, mimicking his movement. a number of dancers notice and laugh, which only increases his discomfort. jezzie's taunting has a strange effect on jacob. he grows distant and withdrawn, even though his body is still going through the motions of the dance. a man taps jezzie on the shoulder. she spins around, smiling, and begins dancing with him. jacob is left alone, dancing by himself. he looks away, uncomfortable. in the shadows a woman kneels close to the floor. she seems to be urinating on the carpet. jacob is shocked. several dancers obscure his view. he turns around. a pregnant woman stands half naked in the kitchen. jacob cannot believe what he sees. in the next room, past jezzie, jacob glimpses a terrifying image, a man whose head seems to be vibrating at such enormous speed that it has lost all definition. something about the image compels and frightens jacob. slowly he approaches it. as he draws nearer to it the tortured image lets out a scream of such pain and unearthly terror that jacob backs away. a woman, laughing, grabs jacob, spins him around, and begins dancing with him. he is totally disoriented.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{hold me, baby!}
<A>__{she takes jacob's arm and guides it to her back. the camera follows his hand as it reaches the smooth skin beneath her sexy, loose fitting dress. he runs his fingers up to her shoulder blades. then, suddenly, he recoils. her back is a mass of shoulder blades, hundreds of strange, bony protrusions. jacob gasps. out of the blue, jezzie leans into him and wiggles her tongue in his ear. jacob, startled, jerks his head and his glasses go flying to the floor.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{he stoops down blindly to pick them up. shoes just miss his fingers as he digs between dancing legs trying to recover them. miraculously, he grabs the spectacles just before they are crushed and slips them back on. instantly his world comes back into focus. as he stands, jacob is surprised to find jezzie facing him, gyrating in wild abandon. there is a huge, satisfied smile on her face. she grabs his hand as if encouraging him to dance but it is obvious that she is dancing to her own rhythm. jacob stares at her, confused. it takes him a moment to realize that her smile is not for him. standing behind jezzie is another dancer, his hands around her waist. they are moving together, locked in erotic embrace. it appears that he is mounting her from behind. looking down we see that the dancer's feet are deformed. they have a bizarre clubbed appearance and look very much like hooves. they skid and careen amidst the dancing feet. something horrible and winglike flaps behind jezzie's back. we cannot make out what it is, but it elicits a primal terror. before jacob can react, jezzie opens her mouth. with a roaring sound, a spiked horn erupts from her throat. it juts menacingly from between her teeth and thrusts into the air. a circle of dancers scream out in excited approval.}
