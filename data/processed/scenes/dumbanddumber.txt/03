<L>__{exterior mutt cuts dog salon day}
<A>__{this building is white with black spots on it, like a dalmation. over the front door is an awning shaped like a dog's snout, whiskers included. a van pulls up outside. the vehicle is decorated like a giant poodle, with four legs hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout on the front grill. mutt cuts is written on the side of it. harry dunne climbs out. he's in his early 30s and dressed in a ridiculous beagle costume, including a cap with floppy ears. he goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm of dogs pile out.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{okay, gang, single file. you know the rules: no pushing, no humping, and no sniffing heinies...}
<A>__{the door to the shop opens and harry's annoyed boss, mr. palmer, sticks his head out.}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{hey, why aren't those mutts on leashes?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{the same reason you're not on a leash, sir because it's demeaning and it chafes like hell.}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{just get them in here now! they all have to be bathed and clipped in an hour.}
<A>__{palmer disappears back inside. harry calls to the dogs but they pay no attention. he struggles to keep them from wandering off. he grabs a couple of small pooches and sits them on a wall.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you kids stay right here...}
<A>__{as he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall isn't a wall it's a flatbed truck. the truck drives away, taking the two dogs with it.}
<C>__{harry }
<P>__{(at truck)}
<D>__{hey, wait a minute!}
<A>__{harry chases after the vehicle.}
