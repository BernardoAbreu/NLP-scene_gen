<D>__{the doctors say he'll be out soon.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that is good news, indeed. tell me, from the way he speaks i'd guess he's been naturalized, like me. is he?}
<A>__{todd is starting to be wary of where this is going.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{he's from germany... from essen. do you know that town?}

<D>__{good bye.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{good bye.}
<A>__{todd exits. ben sits quietly for a moment, thinking. he turns on the television "the price is right". we hear it over the following. ben glances over at the screen which separates him from dussander. slowly his eyelids begin to get heavy. he starts to nod off. but as sleep begins to envelope him, his eyes suddenly fly open. a surge of terror burns across his face. he sits up frightened. a single crutch stands next to the bed. he grabs it. he strips away his covers and the restraints on his leg, once or twice shoving his hand over his mouth to quell a painful scream. he gets to his feet awkwardly, hobbling, half dragging his bad leg. every step he takes is a study in agony. angle on the screen. it slides out of the way, revealing ben staring down at the sleeping dussander. in the pained struggle to keep silent, he brings his face right up to dussander's, close enough to smell his breath.}
