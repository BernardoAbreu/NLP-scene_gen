<A>__{strausz looks in front of him. a green minivan swerves in front of them from out of nowhere. strausz slams on the brakes and skids to a halt. the white minivan rams them from behind. strausz and rizzi are stunned for a moment as two more vans screech up on either side of the cruiser, boxing it in with only a few inches between them. the cruiser is surrounded on all sides. suddenly, shotgun barrels come through the open windows. they come to rest, one on strausz's left temple one on rizzi's right. rizzi looks out of the corner of his eye. he sees the driver of the van next to him holding the shotgun with one hand. a stocking is over the driver's head. strausz looks straight ahead. the minivan in front of them is missing a back window. another man with a stocking on his head aims a sub machine gun at them from inside. by the twisted right hand holding the front of the gun, we know it is verbal. strausz and rizzi raise their hands without being asked.}
