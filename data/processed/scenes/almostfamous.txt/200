<L>__{interior rolling stone offices day}
<A>__{the elevator doors ding open, and out walks russell hammond. the secretary has just finished answering the phone, "straight arrow publishers." she puts the caller on hold.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{hi, i'm russel hammond.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{you're here regarding?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{my life.}
<L>__{interior editorial office day}
<A>__{russell stands with the editors, observing the fine portraits on the walls. he's behind enemy lines, and he knows it. everything in the room fascinates him.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{i don't care what happens. i don't care if you put us on the cover. but you sent us a kid and... and he was a fan. and we all made friends with him absolutely, to get a good story. but then we actually liked him. we thought he's... show us our lives in some mythic way and i guess... we're not mythic. we panicked.}
<C>__{jann}
<D>__{you denied most of the story.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{yeah, well, here's the problem with the truth. it's too true }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well, we appreciate the visit. the last time an artist came here, it was buddy miles and he punched me.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{i'm not punching anybody. i am personally, as of 2 pm yesterday, on a voyage of self reinvention. this is about william miller.}
<P>__{(counting off fingers)}
<D>__{he lives with us, he lost his virginity, he saw us at our worst, appreciated our best, he saved two lives, including mine... he smuggled about a half pound of pot into boston, and we never even told him }
<A>__{nearby, david felton looks at another editor, raising an eyebrow.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{ we told him too much, we told him everything... he almost died with us over tupelo... if the band survives him, it'll be a miracle... but you know, he tried to keep up, and that's a journalist to me.}
<C>__{jann}
<D>__{it's too late. we're going with a different cover.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(immediately)}
<D>__{thank god.}
<A>__{but russell looks around at the numerous portraits if dead legendary rock stars, fixing on the one photo closest to all of them, a very vulnerable looking janis joplin. a second thought.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{you tell me it's too late. but i could go back to my hotel room and... and o.d. tonight and something tells me you'd find a way to put me on the cover of the next issue. am i right?}
<A>__{he looks at their faces. they cannot disagree.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{i'm learning the game.}
<P>__{(beat, shrug)}
<D>__{we fucked up. we made friends with him.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{next time we'll all be more professional.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{maybe so.}
<P>__{(beat, an odd thought)}
<D>__{but god forbid, the day comes when selling yourself is as important as the music you make.}
<P>__{(rueful, to hendrix on the wall)}
<D>__{you might have died at the right time, my friend.}
<C>__{jann}
<D>__{thank you for visiting. good luck.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{do what you want, but the story is true.}
<B>__{long shot russell}
<A>__{at the entrance. raises his hand.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{good evening!}
