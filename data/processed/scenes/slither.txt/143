<L>__{interior flower store night}
<A>__{the buick and suv are destroyed, amidst the ruins of this store. shattered vases and flowers surround them. glass fragments dangle from the window frame. some fall and clink to the floor. starla lifts her battered head from the wheel. she looks beside her to see bill and trevor, seemingly unconscious. she looks back at kylie. the impact has killed her. her neck is bent at an ungodly angle. bone juts up out of her skin. starla looks out her rear window and sees the suv door open, and the diseased driver stumble out. his body is battered and broken, but, still, he lumbers toward her. he tries to speak, but his jaw is broken, and only a mumbly moan comes out. starla struggles to get out of the car. eventually, she does, and she falls to the floor, amidst the broken glass from the shattered window, and the water all over the floor from the broken vases. she sees the moaning driver limping toward her. he's still trying to speak, but he's unintelligible. the driver gets close, ready to grab her. starla sees a metal bar. she grabs it. and slams it into the diseased man's shin. he topples over. she crawls onto the fallen driver and brings the metal bar down into his head, again and again, shouting and crying with fury. starla looks down at the man, who is very dead. starla looks up to see dozens of diseased townsfolk coming at her, from down the street, between buildings. they see starla there.}
