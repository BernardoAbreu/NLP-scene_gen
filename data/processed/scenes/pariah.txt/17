<L>__{interior math classroom day}
<A>__{the math teacher glides up and down the aisles passing out graded tests. a chorus of groans follows in her wake.}
<C>__{math teacher}
<D>__{as promised, i will be grading these on a curve.}
<A>__{alike is folded into the backmost corner of the classroom. the desks in front her and beside her are empty. she is ignored as the rest of the class chatters and passes notes.}
<C>__{math teacher }
<D>__{but the highest grade on the test was a 98.}
<A>__{the math teacher puts alike's test on her desk and gives her a little smile. alike doesn't smile back. the lunch bell rings and the class is a tornado, clearing the room in a rush of limbs, shouts, and backpacks. alike jabs her headphones into her ears and packs her bag very deliberately, letting the eye of the storm pass over her before heading toward the door.}
