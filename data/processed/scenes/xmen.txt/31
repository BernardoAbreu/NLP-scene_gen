<L>__{interior laboratory day}
<A>__{medical monitors beep, keeping track of the vital signs of logan, who lies in a bed in the middle of a medical lab. in the wall beside logan's bed is a light board on which hang logan's x rays. logan's skeleton seems to be more the creation of a deco architect than of nature. streamlined, refined... almost manufactured. he is asleep, recovering. jean grey enters the lab. she walks over and examines the x rays, fascinated by their unique structure. she notices what appears to be an unusually complex network of bones in the forearm. jean looks down and runs her fingers over the traces of three incisions on the backs of logan's hands. jean's eye moves across his body. his rippling muscles. jean uncaps an iv needle and moves to the middle of logan's arm. we cannot help but notice a diamond ring on her left hand. jean starts to put an iv in logan's arm. just as she is sticking the needle in his arm he jolts}
<B>__{violently. snap}
<A>__{logan's hand reaches up quickly, breaking the needle off in his arm. he grabs a startled jean by the throat. he is out of bed. she is unable to speak, choked silent by his grip. he places his fist near her face. we see the three faint scars just above his knuckles. hesitation. logan looks at her for a moment. taken by her beauty. then he is on his feet. jean is on the floor, gasping for breath. logan realizes something is missing. he reaches to his chest and feels for the dog tag. gone. he stifles a curse.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{where is it?}
<A>__{he looks at jean who recoils from him in terror. logan thinks, then bolts.}
