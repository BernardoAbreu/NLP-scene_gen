<L>__{interior diner day}
<A>__{the girls sit at a booth, sipping cokes.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{how much money do we have left?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{not a whole lot.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{i can't believe your fucking parents wouldn't give you anything.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{they totally flipped out that i was even going. they weren't about to give me money for the big trip.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{we should've waited till the end of the month when my mom gets her check.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{she wouldn't have given you anything.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{i know where she keeps her cash. what's she gonna do, send her boyfriend after me?}
<A>__{corey pokes at the crushed ice in her glass with her straw.}
<C>__{corey }
<D>__{doesn't matter. as soon as we get to vegas, we'll be set. my cousin said sometimes she makes two grand in a week.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{sam is impressed, but something about her subdued reaction exhibits reservations... just then, agatha dowdy arrives with plates of burgers and fries.}
<C>__{agatha}
<D>__{here you go. where'd you two say you were from again?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{virginia.}
<C>__{agatha}
<D>__{you hear that, ted?}
<A>__{she calls to ted moncton, who is busy behind the counter.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{agatha}
<D>__{these girls are from virginia.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i will be damned. i'm from reedville, if you know where abouts that is...}
<A>__{neither sam nor corey give much of a hint as to a yes or no.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{well, have yourself some ice cream when you're done, on the house.}
<C>__{corey sam}
<A>__{okay. thank you.}
<C>__{agatha}
<D>__{anything else you need, give a holler.}
<A>__{agatha moves off, and sam and corey start to dig into their food... momentarily, someone else enters and takes a seat at the counter by their booth. it's jeremy frame, the driver of the bmw. he raises a finger to alert ted of his presence.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{just a coffee, please.}
<A>__{ted nods and pours him a cup... after he receives his coffee, jeremy turns and stares at the girls. they both notice him doing it, but corey is the first to speak.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{can we help you?}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{no, no... it's just that i recognize you. i saw you by the motel. pretty amazing, huh?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{i just made a deal with frank haley to buy it for seven hundred fifty dollars.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{whoop dee doo. what the hell are you gonna do with a friggin' meteor?}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{meteorite, actually...}
<A>__{corey rolls her eyes at being corrected. sam smirks and munches on a french fry she's enjoying their conversation.}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{i'm gonna study it. i'm a grad student at redlands... we've actually got a pretty cool geology lab there.}
<A>__{corey focuses on her lunch, ignoring him, but jeremy goes on.}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{i've gotta do some tests, but if i had to guess, i'd say it's a siderite. they're composed primarily of iron and nickel.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{have fun.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{my name's jeremy.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{that's nice.}
<A>__{sam glances up at jeremy, expecting him to be hurt or embarrassed by corey's snub. but he's not. he's smiling at her, and she can't help but smile back.}
