<L>__{interior dirigible, cockpit}
<A>__{dripping wet dogs cower in front of a menacing muntz.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{you lost them?}
<C>__{beta}
<D>__{uh, it was dug.}
<C>__{gamma}
<D>__{yeah, he's with them. he helped them escape!}
<A>__{muntz snarls in anger.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{wait. wait a minute. dug...}
<A>__{he leans over a radar tracking device.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior mountain night continuous}
<A>__{dug's collar screen powers on, and a signal zeroes in on dug's location. dug, oblivious, looks out over the landscape, sniffing. carl and russell peek out from behind a tree.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{see anything?}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{no, my pack is not following us! boy they are dumb.}
<A>__{dug scampers back to carl and russell, who pull the house from behind a tree canopy.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{this is crazy. i finally meet my childhood hero and he's trying to kill us! what a joke.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{hey, i know a joke. a squirrel walks up to a tree and says i forgot to store acorns for winter and now i am dead. ha! it is funny because the squirrel gets dead.}
<A>__{they pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{careful russell.}
<A>__{the house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured bird on the porch.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{you okay, kevin?}
<A>__{kevin goes back to sleep. russell looks at her bandaged leg.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{you know what, mr. fredricksen? the wilderness isn't quite what i expected.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{yeah? how so?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{it's kinda... wild. i mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{hmm, get used to that, kid.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{my dad made it sound so easy. he's really good at camping, and how to make fire from rocks and stuff. he used to come to all my sweatlodge meetings.}
<A>__{russell smiles at the thought.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{and afterwards we'd go get ice cream at fentons. i always get chocolate and he gets butter brickle. then we'd sit on this one curb, right outside, and i will count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones, and whoever gets the most, wins. i like that curb.}
<A>__{he looks up at carl.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{that might sound boring, but i think the boring stuff is the stuff i remember the most.}
<A>__{they walk in silence. carl understands. the bird babies call out in the distance. kevin calls back.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{look, there it is!}
<A>__{russell spots the labyrinth, now close by. he tries to run but is pulled back by his tether. laughing, carl unclips russell's tether.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{hold on russell, stand still!}
<A>__{carl ties the hose harnesses to a tree, securing the house. russell helps kevin off the porch and the group run toward the labyrinth entrance. kevin is reenergized by the sound of her babies. she runs off ahead. carl and russell laugh.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{look at that bird go!}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{wait up, you overgrown chicken!}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{that's it, go kevin! go find your babies!}
<A>__{just as they approach the entrance to the labyrinth, a fierce spotlight hits them. muntz's dirigible lowers overhead.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{run kevin! run!}
<A>__{a net shoots out and binds her. she falls and calls out.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{oh no!}
<A>__{the net catches on a rock. carl and russell run to her aid.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{russell, give me your knife!}
<A>__{carl saws frantically at the net.}
<C>__{muntz }
<D>__{get away from my bird!}
<A>__{muntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible. beside them, a group of dogs drag forward carl's house. muntz hurls a lit lantern. flames burst up beneath the house. heat waves ripple up. balloons pop. carl's house lowers into the fire.}
