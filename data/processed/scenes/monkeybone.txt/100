<A>__{he unlocks the door and enters the darkened lab. finds the dispensary area and kneels beside a locked refrigerator. then he shuffles through the keys on the ring until he finds one labelled "fridge." on the top shelf is a corked beaker of purple fluid bearing the label "oneirix" with red danger stickers all over it. stu bone takes it out, flashes a sinister grin, and empties its contents into a similar beaker. then he refills the original from a hip flask and replaces it. he's just about to leave when he's startled by a series of simian grunts and squeaks which are translated in subtitle:}
<C>__{female baboon}
<D>__{hey, handsome.}
<A>__{he turns and spots a seductive female baboon who's confmed to a cage in the corner. the conversation continues in monkey talk.}
<C>__{female baboon}
<D>__{yeah, you. come here, good looking.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why don't you let me out of this cage? stu bone hey, i'd love to, baby, but...it'd put me in hot water.}
<C>__{female baboon}
<P>__{(caressing his chin)}
<D>__{i know how to be very, very grateful.}
<A>__{he pulls out a matchbook and scribbles a number on it.}
<D>__{stu bone tell you what, angel. when you get out, give me a call...}
<A>__{a light goes on suddenly in the outside hallway! stu bone tries to dive for cover, but the female baboon grabs him by the belt and pulls him against the cage. startled, he drops the oneirix beaker which rolls out into the hall!}
