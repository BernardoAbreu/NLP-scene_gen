<L>__{exterior beach night}
<A>__{chuck lies on his palm fronds, groaning and holding his stomach. he drags himself to his knees, crawls a few feet, and throws up in great, violent heaves.}
<L>__{exterior beach day}
<A>__{still looking a little green, chuck marks another day on his tree calendar.}
<L>__{exterior summit}
<A>__{he stares out to sea. nothing.}
<L>__{exterior well day}
<A>__{chuck lies on his belly and drinks from the well, which has filled with water. then he washes his face and splashes water over his neck. the surface of the well stills, bringing chuck's reflection into focus. he stares at himself. very carefully chuck shaves with the surgeon's scalpel. chuck checks out his new appearance in the water. much better. a clean start now.}
