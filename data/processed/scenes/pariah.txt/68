<A>__{laura cuffs alike on the neck, pulling alike's hoodie up over her face. alike's laugh is tentative at first, not sure whether this is play or for real. laura chuckles, breaking the ice. the pair slapbox and rough house, both missing with wild arcing blows. laura aims a mini charge at alike that lifts her off the ground and deposits her a short distance away. alike swipes laura's hat. laura claps alike on the shoulder and alike waves to bina. bina waves and smiles.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{so whatchu you think? she's cool right?}
<A>__{laura looks around and shrugs. laura plucks a fresh joint out of her coat and lights it.}
<C>__{alike }
<D>__{she's hot right? i told you. it was so tight. i'm tellin' you, you shoulda been there tonight!}
<A>__{laura takes a puff and offers it to alike.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{this one's just for me and you.}
<A>__{alike waves it off, oblivious and intoxicated with the night.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{and she's smart, too. she does poetry, you should hear it. it's like, it's good, you know?}
<A>__{laura stops walking and alike skips ahead, still chattering.}
<C>__{alike }
<D>__{i was thinking next weekend the three of us could }
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{look, i'm right here.}
<A>__{alike snaps out of it.}

<C>__{alike}
<D>__{c'mon man, you know you're my best friend. nobody's gonna }

<D>__{you don't need to say anything. i just wanted to get it off my chest. i'm happy for you, that's all.}
<A>__{alike shakes her head. her mouth moves but nothing comes out.}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{because i love you, alright? and i'm sayin'...i'm right here.}
<A>__{alike is stopped cold, as the light bulb finally goes off. laura takes a long drag on the jointerior bina and mika stumble over giggling. bina hooks alike's arm. mika kisses laura on the neck. laura snaps out of her gaze, her familiar smirk creeping back.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{we goin' to get something to eat?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{that's what's up.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{listen, umm }
<A>__{laura pinches out the joint and hands it to mika who tucks it away.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{that's for later. bina, nice to meet you.}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{you too. we had fun.}
<A>__{laura gives bina a polite hug, pounds alike on the shoulder and starts to lead mika away.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{byyeee!!}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{hey hold up!}
<A>__{laura pumps a lazy fist in the air in acknowledgement. bina takes alike's hand and slowly drags her away. alike keeps looking back, then finally gives up. laura looks back just as alike turns around and disappears around the corner.}
<C>__{bina }
<D>__{i like your friends. they're cool.}
