<D>__{whatever happened to women in back?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{reality check, dillweed. this is 1995.}
<A>__{pulling away from the curb, beth honks at mrs. blankenship, at least}
<L>__{80, owner of the student boarding house across the street.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{see you tonight, mrs. blankenship!}
<A>__{the old woman just stares forward. a gardem hose in hand as she waters a garden of long dead flowers. kara shields her eyes, distracted, looking up at the old victorian house. kara's p.o.v. beth drives down a shady, tree lined avenue, unaware of the white van that is following them.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{why? you interested?}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{no! i keep seeing him staring out his window. watching me.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{you mean tommy. yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven. supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid. messed up his head. he's harmless, though. probably just lonely.}

<C>__{tim}
<D>__{only when you're around to dump on ... hey, chill, sis. i'm just doggin' ya.}
<A>__{suddenly the van roars by and cuts them off. beth lays on the horn. slams on the brakes. narrowly avoiding a collision.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{speed kills, asshole!}
<A>__{suddenly the van swerves around to face the vw head on. for a breathless moment the van and the vw sit at opposite ends of the intersection. idling. a tense stand off.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{who is that ...}
<A>__{kara strains to get a look at the van's driver. a momentary glimpse of a pale white face behind the wheel.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(bravely)}
<D>__{i've got my pepper spray.}
<A>__{danny sits frozen in the back seat. suddenly the van shoots forward, tires screaming. startled gasps. the van turns off sharply at the last second, screeching down the next block.}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{happy fuckin' halloween.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.}
<A>__{beth drives on, grimly determined. kara looks back at danny. he returns her frightened gaze.}
