<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{the singing dies away, and the sound returns to normal. over mark's shoulder we see mrs. stephens holding her stick in front of her.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{why don't you lie to me? i'd never know...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you'd know at once }
<A>__{mrs. stephens smiles then turns her head towards the}
<L>__{16mm screen.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{take me to your cinema.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{he takes her arm gently and guides her towards us. both of them stare at the 16mm screen... she leans forward her face only inches from the screen the light from the projector flickering on to her. reverse angle shot of mrs. stephens. slowly she stretches out her hands and touches the screen.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{what am i seeing, mark?}
<A>__{her head and shoulders blot out most of the screen but between her outspread fingers we catch a glimpse of a girl's terrified eyes.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{why don't you answer?}
<A>__{close shot of mark and mrs. stephens.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(staring at the screen)}
<D>__{it's no good i was afraid it wouldn't be.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{the lights failed too soon.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{they always do.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i will have to try again.}
<A>__{he hurries to his cine camera.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{i've yet to meet an artist who could judge his own work...}
<A>__{mark slips a new spool of film into his cine camera.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{what do you think you've spoiled?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{an opportunity... now i must find another.}
<A>__{he looks at her thoughtfully, then presses a light switch. a spotlight falls blindingly on to her eyes. he presses another switch, and then another, until the whole of her face is shining with light.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{why are you putting those lights on my face?}
<A>__{he walks towards her. she starts to back away. the shadow of mark's head appears on the 16mm screen. we see him raise his camera then pull down the tripod. black out into the grey darkness of mrs. stephens' world. we hear the purring of mark's camera more clearly than we have yet heard it. (there is the faint rasp of a cog which needs oiling.) the sound of footsteps approaching... the purring changes direction.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens }
<D>__{mark...}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{it's almost over...}
<A>__{the purring is on top of her. there is a sudden thud.}
