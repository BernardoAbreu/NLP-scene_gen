<L>__{exterior campfire (mars) night}
<A>__{gallagher's half filled with regret, half annoyed with himself. sighs, shuts his eyes, tries to get some sleep.}
<L>__{interior mission control night}
<A>__{place is ragged}
<D>__{coffee on the workstations, techs as unshaven and beat as the crew on mars.}
<C>__{russert}
<D>__{all right, people, we bought ourselves another eighteen hours in orbit. the crew's burning pretty much what we've got on the surface so they don't freeze solid. so whatever we can come up with...}
<C>__{lowenthal}
<D>__{...has got to work before the sun sets again tomorrow and they freeze to death anyhow.}
<C>__{russert}
<D>__{what else is on mars?}
<C>__{schlissel}
<D>__{rocks. sand.}
<C>__{russert}
<D>__{the janitor just built a radio out of a fifty year old rover mission. now, what else is on mars?}
<A>__{mars maps come up on all their pims. there are things on the surface. marked with various symbols. leftovers from other missions.}
<C>__{skavlem}
<D>__{we sent a dozen probes even before the biologics started up. eight were return missions.}
<C>__{lowenthal}
<D>__{and they're back.}
<C>__{skavlem}
<D>__{there's a viking lander...}
<C>__{schlissel}
<D>__{2,200 kilometers away.}
<A>__{silence. they all stare at the pims. and then schlissel turns to a nearby tech }
<C>__{schlissel}
<D>__{s.y.f.}
<C>__{tech}
<D>__{slap your forehead.}
<C>__{schlissel}
<D>__{we're not the only people who sent stuff to mars.}
<A>__{other overlays come up on the maps. new colors. new symbols.}
<C>__{skavlem}
<D>__{the twenties were nothing but unmanned sample return missions. everyone wanted to bring back a bucket of mars rocks.}
<A>__{they find something near the hab.}
<C>__{schlissel}
<D>__{there was euro malaysian sample return mission 2018.}
<C>__{tech}
<D>__{checking...}
<C>__{lowenthal}
<P>__{(knows)}
<D>__{it blew up on attempted return.}
<A>__{looking further afield, they find something else.}
<C>__{tech}
<D>__{it ain't close, but there's an uzbecki s.r.m. that failed to launch.}
<C>__{schlissel}
<P>__{(argh)}
<D>__{an uzbecki probe from 2032.}
<C>__{russert}
<D>__{is it viable? can we get plans?}
<C>__{schlissel}
<P>__{it was built at the cosmos factory in garagin in 2031. (there's more)}
<D>__{the factory closed eight years later. and then it burnt down.}
<A>__{all right, that's the end of that. and then schlissel spots a detail that means something to him.}
<C>__{schlissel}
<D>__{it was designed by aleksandr ivanovich borokovski. he was the last of the greats in the russian space program.}
<C>__{russert}
<D>__{is he still alive??}
<A>__{schlissel's pim flickers madly as he mutters at it.}
<C>__{schlissel}
<D>__{there's no closing date on his bio. he'd be in his seventies.}
<C>__{russert}
<D>__{find him. somebody get on the line to kazakhstan.}
<C>__{lowenthal}
<D>__{this is insanity. a thirty year old lander built in a factory that doesn't exist anymore.}
<C>__{tech}
<D>__{found him!}
<C>__{schlissel}
<D>__{he emigrated. he runs a deli in brooklyn.}
