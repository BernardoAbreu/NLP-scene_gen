<L>__{exterior the stream the others}
<A>__{as the dawn sky brightens, moonwatcher and his tribe reach the shallow stream. the others are already there. they were there on the other side every day – that did not make it any less annoying. there are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish them from the members of moonwatcher's own tribe. as they see him coming, the others begin to angrily dance and shriek on their side of the stream, and his own people reply in kind. the confrontation lasts a few minutes – then the display dies out as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of the muddy water. honor has been satisfied – each group has staked its claim to its own territory.}
