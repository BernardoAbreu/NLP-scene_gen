<L>__{exterior engine chambers day}
<A>__{a maze of pipes, hoses, gears, engines and catwalks. things are hissing, humming, rumbling and clanking. a spooky place. dark. damp. eerie. ominous. mulligan and vivo, looking more nervous by the moment, lead the way. finnegan and pantucci follow.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<P>__{(rattling, nervous)}
<D>__{you know what i'm gonna do after this...i'm gonna get a normal life...}
<C>__{finnegan}
<P>__{(calm)}
<D>__{joey...}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{...like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games...}
<A>__{finnegan turns to pantucci, his voice even, calm, almost kind.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{joey...it's okay...}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{what? you don't think i can have a normal life?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{joey...look at me...}
<A>__{he forces pantucci to look him in the eyes.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{we're gonna get what we gotta get... do what we gotta do...and get the hell outta here...okay?}
<A>__{pantucci draws his strength from finnegan. he forces himself to take a deep breath.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{okay...}
<A>__{suddenly, overhead, something black and veiny skitters across the mass of pipes, so fast it shocks pantucci back into the wall.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{what the...???}
<A>__{he and vivo spin their guns at the pipes. the red dots of their laser sights sweep the shadowy web of metal. nothing.}
<C>__{mulligan }
<D>__{come on...the sooner we get outta here the better i will feel. mulligan and vivo move forward.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{finnegan...}
<A>__{finnegan turns to pantucci, who has not moved from where he hit the wall.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{it's okay...come on...}
<C>__{pantucci}
<P>__{(scared)}
<D>__{i'm stuck...}
<A>__{pantucci tries to pull away from the wall. he is stuck.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<P>__{(jumpy)}
<D>__{hey! what are you trying to pull!}
<C>__{pantucci}
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{john...}
<A>__{finnegan takes pantucci by the front of his shirt, ignoring mulligan.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{relax your arms...slowly...that's it...}
<A>__{as finnegan pulls, pantucci does as he is told. he slips away from the wall. the jacket doesn't.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{what the...}
<A>__{he reaches out to touch the wall. finnegan grabs his wrist, grabs a flashlight from vivo's utility belt and shines it on the wall. their pov the entire wall is covered in a strange, yellow, secreted gelatin. laid on in some sort of weird, inhuman, geometric pattern. like a spider web.}
