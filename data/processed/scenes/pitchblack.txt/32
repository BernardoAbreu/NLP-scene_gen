<L>__{interior main cabin crash ship day}
<A>__{johns helps fry through the carnage. she's stunned by it all but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be. realizing she's in nav bay, fry starts digging like a search dog to uncover... owens. still strapped to his chair. metal rod piercing his chest close to the heart. dead. fry reaches out to touch him.}
<C>__{owens}
<D>__{out, out, out, get it outta me!}
<A>__{she recoils hard. he's still alive . the other survivors bungle over. ten seconds of pure chaos:}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{pull it out of him...no, it's too close to the heart...you gotta do it, just do it fast....}
<A>__{fry grabs the rod.}
<C>__{owens}
<D>__{don't touch it! don't touch that switch!}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{you'll kill him, i'm tellin' you, shit, just leave it alone...delirious...doncha you got some drugs for this poor man....}
<C>__{owens}
<D>__{don't touch that switch!}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{awright, awright, someone...there's anestaphine in the med lock, that end of the cabin...next to....}
<A>__{but there is no more "that end." in exquisite pain, owens screams on. reaction shots of johns, audrey. seldom are human beings witness to such raw suffering.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{get away. everybody.}
<A>__{the others leave except for audrey, staying behind to watch in morbid fascination. johns doubles back and collars her. leaving, they pass... riddick, cuffed to a bulkhead. his eyes, still hidden by goggles, track johns and audrey toward daylight.}
