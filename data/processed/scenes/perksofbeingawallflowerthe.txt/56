<L>__{interior library day}
<A>__{we see patrick and brad walking in the library. they reach the stacks, and just when it looks like they'll speak, they simply... pass each other without a word.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{patrick was eventually able to help brad get sober. i asked patrick if he felt sad that he had to keep it a secret, and he said no because at least now, brad doesn't have to get drunk to love him.}
<A>__{brad sits down with his football pals. patrick joins charlie and sam at their table. charlie looks over at sam, studying hard for her sat's.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i think that i understand because i really like sam. i asked my sister about her, and she said that when sam was a freshman, the upper classmen used to get her drunk at parties. i guess she had a reputation. but i don't care. i'd hate for her to judge me based on what i used to be like.}
