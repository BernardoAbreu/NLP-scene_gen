<L>__{exterior beach early day}
<A>__{eric's body, loaded on to a a coal bucket, moves off on it's final journey. carter, laughing, walks beside it, gun riding on his shoulder. the bucket shudders and grinds as it moves along the cable. eric's body moves of on its final journey. it reaches the end of the line, where an automatic catch tilts it. eric's body drops into the sea. the coal slag follows in a cloud of black dust. the waves pass over and everything is gone. carter stands for a moment, turns and walks back along the beach. he stops, looks at the shotgun, and decides to get rid of it.}
