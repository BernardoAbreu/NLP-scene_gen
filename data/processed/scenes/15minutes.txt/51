<A>__{jordy's more surprised than shaken. it's a fire he knows the drill. he pushes her into the living room. then notices a fire extinguisher hanging on the wall. grabs it. aims it at the fire spreading in the kitchen. he sprays as daphne screams!}
<C>__{daphne}
<D>__{that's not mine!}
<A>__{whooooooooosh! the fire extinguisher feeds the fire! flames leap up from the fire shooting toward the extinguisher because it's filled with gasoline. the handle locks! jordy can't turn it off. flames engulf the extinguisher and jordy's hand. he flings the extinguisher backs out of the kitchen. closes the door. jordy takes off his jacket. stuffs it under the bottom of the door. blocking the smoke. he hurries into the living room. knowing it's moments before the extinguisher will explode. jordy pulls out his cellular. hits the speed dial as he notices daphne about to throw a chair through the window.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{don't! it'll suck the flames toward us!}
<A>__{too late. she smashes the window. there's an explosion in the kitchen. smoke and fire rush down the hallway and along the ceiling. jordy yells into the phone:}

<A>__{he pulls daphne toward the bedroom. it's locked. jordy kicks it open. grabs the comforter off the bed. shoves that under the door jam. he pulls daphne into the bathroom. shuts the door. runs his severely burned hand under the cold water. daphne looks out the window hearing the sirens. she notices someone has nailed the window shut. and on top of one nail...is eddie's gold shield.}
<C>__{daphne}
<D>__{oh my g d! oh my g d!}
<A>__{jordy turns sees eddie's shield.}

<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{calm down. get a hold of yourself! get down!}
<A>__{he pulls aside the curtain to the bathtub. in it is a can of gasoline. a virtual bomb.}
<C>__{jordy }
<D>__{oh jesus!}
<A>__{daphne reaches for the can of gasoline.}
<C>__{jordy }
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{daphne}
<D>__{pouring it out!}
<A>__{she grabs the can of gasoline pours it down the drain. the fire is raging outside the bathroom. the bathroom door is beginning to smoke and burn. they are trapped. jordy turns grabs an exposed water pipe that runs up the wall to the ceiling. he throws his feet against the wall for leverage. pulls with all his might to break it loose. it's creaking but he's having a hard time with it.}
<C>__{daphne }
<D>__{oh shit!}
<A>__{jordy looks over. the gasoline she's pouring out is not going down the drain. it's stopped up. as soon as the fire gets in the bathroom, everything will explode! jordy begins pulling at the rusty pipe with all his might. daphne comes over helps him. both of them trying to break it off. suddenly it snaps and water pours into the room. soaking the walls. they point the pipe toward the door, soaking some of the flames which are consuming the door. trying to stop the fire from coming in. he and daphne are drenched. and trapped. jordy grabs a broken piece of pipe. starts smashing the wall behind them. the wall to the adjacent apartment.}
