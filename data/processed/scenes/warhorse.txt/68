<B>__{day.}
<A>__{grandfather helps to swing emilie up and into the saddle. all at once, the grandfather's charity evaporates.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{it was your mother's. i hid it, so as not to encourage you. emilie, i want you to ride very slowly, very carefully. and promise me you won't go far }
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{of course. okay, i promise.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{to the top of the hill and straight back again.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{i promise.}
<A>__{emilie unties her hair and tosses the red pennant to grandfather, releasing her hair to spill down her back and shoulder.}
<C>__{emilie }
<D>__{my hero.}
<A>__{she sets off on joey and quickly spurs him to a gallop.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{slowly...slowly...}
<A>__{she rides past the windmill and then over the top of a nearby hill she speeds over it and out of sight. back to the hill a sudden change of mood. an empty shot. no movement, no returning girl.}
<C>__{grandfather }
<D>__{emilie!}
<A>__{cut again to the top of the hill, then back to the grandfather, very worried.}
<C>__{grandfather }
<D>__{emilie!}
<A>__{topthorn suddenly rears up and charges off following, sensing danger. grandfather starts to run in the direction of the hill. topthorn charging over the brow of the hill. the grandfather running out of breath. he hears an indistinct scream from emilie! he reaches the top of the hill comes over the brow and there is not the fallen body of emilie, which he has been fearing, but a brutal line of german soldiers and motorbikes. it is like a line of indians in a western total, alien fear. and there amongst them is emilie, astride a panicked joey, surrounded by soldiers. another one holds topthorn, who bucks and rears, but to no avail. grandfather starts down the hill towards his granddaughter.}
