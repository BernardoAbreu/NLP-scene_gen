<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{johana comes into the bathroom, closes the door, cutting down the blaring music. the paint is peeling off the ceiling. bonita is standing under a 40 watt lamp, putting on make up in front of jacques' cracked shaving mirror.}
<C>__{bonita}
<D>__{you're going to live here permanently?}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{... maybe, if jacques will let me fix up the place a little.}
<A>__{johana walks over to the mirror and watches bonita put on her make up like a professional.}
<C>__{bonita}
<P>__{(wistfully)}
<D>__{he's shy, not like enzo.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{yes. not like enzo.}
<C>__{bonita}
<P>__{(putting on eyelashes)}
<D>__{i think, he's really nice... he's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(after a long silence)}
<D>__{... i'm pregnant, bonita!}
<A>__{bonita stops working on her make up and looks pensively at}
<B>__{johana.}
<C>__{bonita}
<D>__{are you going to keep it?}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{bonita}
<D>__{does he know?}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{bonita}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{maybe you should talk to him about it.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{i can't... i just don't know how to...}
<A>__{bonita looks at her with the same pensive look. johana goes on.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{i was thinking of something kinda stupid last night. you know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the gods. take leda for example, sleeping with jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... well, can you imagine leda announcing to her swan "you're going to be a father, my little chick a dee"?}
<C>__{bonita}
<P>__{(starts laughing)}
<D>__{but your man isn't quite a god!}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{probably not, but i still don't have the nerve to tell him.}
<C>__{bonita}
<D>__{well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!}
<A>__{unconvinced, johana nods. she changes the subject.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{and you...? do you love enzo?}
<C>__{bonita}
<P>__{(earnestly)}
<D>__{very much, i think.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{but, there's going to be a problem.}
