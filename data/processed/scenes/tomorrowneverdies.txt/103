<A>__{bond emerges, carrying the charts, along with wade.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i have to get these to london. do you know this captain cheong?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{spends his nights at the kuala lumpur yacht club.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{can you arrange a meeting?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{hell. the cia built that club.}
<L>__{exterior kuala lumpur yacht club night}
<A>__{palm trees, torch lights, and rolls royces.}
<L>__{interior kuala lumpur yacht club night}
<A>__{a local band plays on the verandah. we find wade at a poker table with five local malay chinese. he cuts the cards, exuberantly:}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{okay gentlemen. the name of the game is 7 card cambodian stud. everything is wild!}
<A>__{and then moving through a beaded glass curtain we find bond, in a white dinner jacket, sitting with captain cheong. the captain is elegant, mid 5o's, eye patch. (to be put into local dialect.)}
<C>__{captain cheong}
<D>__{in the strait of malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, mr. bond.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i know. pirates from sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from thailand and burma want the ships.}
<C>__{captain cheong}
<D>__{sometimes kill the crew; other times }
<P>__{(points to his eye)}
<D>__{torture them.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{captain cheong}
<D>__{the kuala lumpur ferry was 35 miles off course that night. captain blamed the auto pilot; i suspected he was drunk until the sumatra ferry captain had same problem.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{did you test the auto pilots? the satellite positioning receiver?}
<C>__{captain cheong}
<D>__{next morning. both boats. nothing wrong.}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{my 90 year old grandfather thinks 'ghost in the computer silicon dragon.'}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(smiles, standing to leave)}
<D>__{i appreciate your time }
<C>__{captain cheong}
<D>__{maybe you should talk to sidney winch. owns a marine salvage company. nobody knows more about the strait.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{where can i find him?}
<C>__{captain cheong}
<D>__{him? he, is a she }
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{at the bar.}
<A>__{new angle the bar sidney winch, about 32, tough, smart, and (here's a surprise,) beautiful, is ordering a drink when bond appears:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{bourbon. neat.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.}
<A>__{very slowly, sidney turns to bond. she looks him up and down as if deciding whether this specimen is worth her time. her conclusion: a definite though skeptical maybe. she gives him a sultry smile:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. be reckless.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{ and i bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(thinking, 'not bad')}
<D>__{have we met?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{this afternoon. our boats practically kissed in the harbor.}
<P>__{(holds out his hand to shake)}
<D>__{james bond.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{sidney winch.}
<A>__{the bartender appears.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{vodka martini, shaken not stirred.}
<P>__{(to sidney)}
<D>__{and another for you?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no. but you can buy a drink for my friend, taro.}
<A>__{she steps back revealing a huge samoan, taro, wearing a dark suit and tie, sitting on a stool. taro smiles menacingly at bond.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{boyfriend?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{chaperone. i'm waiting for my dinner date.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{pity.}
<P>__{(to bartender)}
<D>__{bring him whatever he wants.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{so what brings you to kuala lumpur, mr. bond?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{wait don't tell me: unhappy marriage? running from some poor little girl with two kids and a chanel pocketbook in london?}
<A>__{bond analyzes the situation: 1) she's with a thug. 2) she's in marine salvage. 3) she went to the harbor master's office for the charts.}
