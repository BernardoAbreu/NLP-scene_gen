<A>__{nicole quietly exits the house, carrying a crate of her stuff. she has a duffel bag of clothes over her shoulder as she makes her way to sheila's car that we see parked at the top of the driveway, far from the house.}
<L>__{interior whitaker ranch bedroom later same day}
<A>__{whip stirs, wakes up and looks around. whip walks around looking for nicole. he finds the note and reads it. the reality of her disappearance sets in and he moves to the window and stares out at the barn. whip returns his look inside the house and he sees the big book of aa on the table near where the letter was left. whip picks it up and throws it across the room. he then grabs the back of a chair and tosses it against the wall. after wiping photos off of the wall he picks up an empty beer bottle and fires the bottle at a shelf on the opposite wall. the bottle explodes and whip stops as he realizes he came within an inch of shattering a framed photo of he and his son. we hear the antiquated ring of the old house phone. whip relaxes his shoulders as the ringing phone distracts him. whip is now drawing heavy breaths as the ringing phone is answered by the old machine...}
