<L>__{interior museum hall of the gems night}
<A>__{the gems glow in the darkness as pendergast passes through the now empty room.}
<L>__{interior meteorite room night}
<A>__{pendergast's footfalls are lost in the carpet as he goes down the far stairs.}
<L>__{interior hallway museum night}
<A>__{pendergast goes down a long, dark hall alone. he arrives at a door marked physical anthropology lab, enters.}
<L>__{interior physical anthropology lab night}
<A>__{the skeletons throw odd shadows on the ceiling. margo's computer screen glows at the end of the room, casting the only light. but her chair is empty. the room is quiet. pendergast approaches slowly, looks around.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{dr. green?}
<A>__{no answer. pendergast glances at the computer screen, sees graphs and complicated notations. he scrolls down, leans closer. he can't figure it out. he slides into margo's chair, fascinated. then...}
<C>__{margo }
<D>__{you have a warrant to look at that?}
<A>__{pendergast leaps up. margo has appeared in the doorway behind him, a cup of coffee in her hand.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{special agent pendergast. fbi. forgive me. i guess i was snooping. what is this?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{an invention of mine. it's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its dna. i call it the genetic sequence extrapolator.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{how does it work?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{with a dna analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...}
<P>__{(abrupt)}
<D>__{you aren't here for a lesson in dna.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{i came to talk about dr. john whittlesley.}
<A>__{margo turns to put down her coffee. she takes a moment to compose herself. when she turns back, her voice is quiet.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{somehow, when all this happened... i knew it would come back to john. is he really dead?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{maybe not.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{if he were alive he'd have contacted me.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{you have time to talk?}
