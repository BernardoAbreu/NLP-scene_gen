<A>__{we do a slow 360 around freddy in the men's room. we can hear the dog barking.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{every nerve ending, all of my senses, the blood in my veins, everything i has was screaming, "take off, man, just take off, get the fuck outta there!" panic hit me like a bucket of water. first there was the shock of it bam, right in the face! then i'm just standin there drenched in panic.}
<B>__{slow motion}
<A>__{camera does a pan from face to face of the sheriffs.}
<C>__{freddy }

<B>__{freeze frame}
<A>__{back to the same freeze frame shot of freddy standing in front of the sheriffs. it suddenly jerks to life, and moves to speed. the dog is barking. freddy moves to his right, out of frame. we stay on the sheriffs. one sheriff yells at the dog.}
<D>__{sheriff #1 shut up!}
<A>__{the dog quiets down. sheriff #2 continues with his story. a couple of the sheriffs look over at freddy off screen, but as sheriff #2 talks, turn their attention to him.}
<D>__{sheriff #2 so my gun's drawn, right? i got it aimed right at him. i tell 'em, "freeze, don't fuckin move." and the little idiot's lookin at me, nodding his head "yes," sayin "i know...i know...i know." meanwhile his right hand is creepin towards his glove box. so i scream at him, "asshole, you better fuckin freeze right now!" and he's still lookin right at me, saying "i know...i know...i know." and his right hand's still going for the glove box.}
<A>__{the camera pans away from the sheriffs to freddy, up against the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss.}
<P>__{sheriff #2 (o.s.)}
<D>__{i tell 'im, "buddy, i'm gonna shoot you in the face right now if you don't put your hands on the fuckin dash." and the guy's girlfriend, a real sexy oriental bitch, starts screamin at him, "chuck, are you out of your mind? put your hands on the dash like the officer said." and then like nothing, the guy snaps out of it and casually puts his hands on the dash.}
<A>__{freddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past the sheriffs over to the sink. the camera pans with him. a sheriff is sitting on a sink. he looks down and watches freddy wash his hands.}
<D>__{sheriff #1 what was he goin for? sheriff #2 his registration. stupid fuckin citizen, doesn't have the slightest idea how close he came to gettin shot.}
<A>__{freddy finishes washing his hands. he goes to dry them, but there's only those hand drying machines. freddy turns on the drying machine. he can't hear anything the sheriffs say now. the sound of the machine dominates the sound track. these following shots are slow motion.}
