<L>__{exterior track day}
<A>__{mater drives up the track. mcqueen gains, fast. because mater's going backwards, they're face to face (but still with some distance between them).}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{mater, wait!}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{stay back! if you get close to me, you gonna get hurt real bad!}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{i know i made you feel that way before, but none of that matters because we're best friends!}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{tv footage of mcqueen chasing mater}
<C>__{brent mustangburger }
<D>__{and mcqueen seems to be having a conversation with the tow truck!}
<C>__{darrell cartrip }
<D>__{i don't know who that truck is, brent. but i will tell you what, he's gotta be the world's best backwards driver.}
<A>__{reveal zundapp is watching this footage from his luxury box. the closer mcqueen gets to mater the farther his tire rolls onto the detonator. but he holds back ever so slightly so as not to jump the gun. on the track mcqueen gains on mater.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{mcqueen, you don't get it. i'm the bomb!}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{yes, mater! you are the bomb! that's what i'm trying to say here. you've always been the bomb! and you'll always be the bomb.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{stay away!}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{no! never!}
<A>__{on zundapp. he watches as mcqueen speeds up.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{almost there...}
<A>__{on mcqueen. he's had enough screwing around. here he comes.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{i'm not...letting you...}
<A>__{he's going to catch him now.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{...get away again!}
<A>__{mcqueen jumps forward, in an attempt to grab mater's hook }
<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{gotta keep away from mcqueen.}
<A>__{mcqueen hooks mater with his bumper just as }
<C>__{mater's computer}
<D>__{request acknowledged.}
<A>__{turbine rockets slide out of mater.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{oh my gosh!}
<A>__{bawhoooooom!!!!! mater jolts forward with a rocket blast and disappears, taking mcqueen with him. on zundapp. he now freely pushes the detonator, but it says "out of range." zundapp can't believe it. he flips out. farther up the track francesco speeds along. zhwaaaaap!!! mater and mcqueen zing past him with a red blur.}
<C>__{francesco}
<D>__{what is happening? it's a bad dream.}
<A>__{now even farther up the track mater takes a turn, smashes through a fence and skids around a corner out of sight. a white, smoky jet trail is all that remains. in mcqueen's pit all of radiator springs watches the television monitors, dumbfounded.}
<C>__{brent mustangburger }
<D>__{and lightning mcqueen just blasted away, hooked to the now rocket propelled tow truck.}
