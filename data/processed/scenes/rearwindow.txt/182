<L>__{exterior neighborhood night long shot}
<A>__{all we can see is the glow of the salesman's cigar.}
<T>__{fade out: fade in:}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day medium shot}
<A>__{jeff is seated by the window in his wheelchair. he is talking on the telephone while his eyes are still on the neighborhood. there is a touch of urgency in his voice.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{look, doyle it's just one of those things i can't tell you on the phone. you have to be here, and see the whole set up.}
<A>__{the camera pulls back slightly as stella emerges from the kitchen. she is carrying a tray with breakfast on it. eggs, bacon, toast and coffee.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{it's probably nothing important just a little neighborhood murder, that's all. as a matter of fact, i did say "murder".}
<A>__{stella squeezes past the right side of jeff, and places the food tray on a windowseat in front of him. she peers out cautiously toward thorwald's apartment for a moment. then she squeezes back, moving to the sideboard against which leans a small table on an adjustable stand.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{my only thought was to throw a little business your way. a good detective, i reasoned, would jump at the chance to detect.}
<A>__{stella returns with the table, and sets it up so that it is across jeff's lap. she gets the tray of food pausing to look toward thorwald's apartment. then she places the breakfast on the tray table in front of jeff. he has moved back a little to avoid getting the phone cable tangled in the food and dishes.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{well, i usually took my best pictures on my day off.}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{okay, doyle soon as you can.}
