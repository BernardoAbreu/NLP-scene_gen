<A>__{later, hector and beatrice are enjoying each other immensely, making love by the stream. beatrice hasn't removed her new shoes, she likes them so much. she is dabbing hector with her perfume which, he has discovered, she keeps in a small bottle kept in a pouch on a chain around her neck. nearby the corpse of the squire still lies, its head shrouded in stones, as if absurdly hiding its eyes from the antics of hector and beatrice. the old shoes beatrice has placed on its feet look odd compared to the fine uniform. hector and beatrice seem unaware of the strangeness of their situation, but perhaps it only looks strange to our modern eyes. hector continues to bask in her wonderful aroma.}

<D>__{you're eager today, hector, aren't you? is it all this death?}
