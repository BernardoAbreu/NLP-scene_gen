<D>__{let go of me! let go!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{settle down, percy!}
<A>__{percy tries to jerk away, crashes into the desk. the book he was reading falls to the floor and a "tijuana bible" is revealed within the pages. it's a pornographic cartoon book of the type popular in the '30's, featuring crude drawings of famous cartoon characters or movie stars engaged in outlandish sexual acts. this one has olive oyl getting it doggy style from popeye. the word balloon over his head features his famous laugh: "uk uk uk uk!"}
