<L>__{interior precinct house, captain's office early evening}
<A>__{an office full of pictures, books and mugsheets, yet it is meticulously well kept. the captain, 50, sits at his tidy desk. he's dressed conservatively. mills and somerset sit before him. somerset reads from a photocopy of the note they just found.}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"one pound of flesh, no more no less. no cartilage, no bone, but only flesh. this task done, and he would go free."}
<A>__{the captain is a calm man, but whenever not speaking, without fail, he clenches his jaw repeatedly, causing the muscles in his neck and jaw to pulse. somerset stands, paces.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{this victim, mr. gold, was tied down nude, holding a carving knife. and he was given a long time... to decide. where to make the first cut? there's a gun to your head... but, what part or parts of your body are expendable?}
<A>__{mills sits back in his chair, arms crossed, seems anxious, doesn't know why they're here.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{mr. gold tried for the whole pound at once, his love handle. but, he went into shock. bled to death.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{what is the point, somerset?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{look at both killings together. this murderer is an artist.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{an artist?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{he uses colors and symbols. he positions the bodies after death, so he's working with composition. it's been premeditated so meticulously... and this is just the beginning.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{wrong. for all we know, we might never hear from him again, and i don't want that kind of talk floating around.}
<A>__{somerset shakes his head "no."}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{the rats and the pennies. the circle and the triangle on the wall. there's something about them... these murders mean something.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{so? what?}
<A>__{somerset has no answer. the captain is irked, jaw clenching.}
<C>__{captain }
<P>__{(to mills)}
<D>__{you with him, or you just here to watch?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{this is his stuff, captain. i've been out in the cold most of the day.}
<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(to somerset)}
<D>__{always working overtime up in that big brain of yours, huh? always cooking.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i need you to know... i want us reassigned. we're declining this case.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(sits up, angry)}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{what the hell are you talking about?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{this cannot be my last duty here. it's going to go on and on.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{you've left unfinished business before.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{everything else was taken as close to a conclusion as humanly possible.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{can i just say something?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{also... i don't think this should be mills' first case.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{this is not my first case, fuckhead!}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{i don't have anyone else to give this to, somerset. and nobody's going to swap with you.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{give it to me, then. there's nothing that says i have to fly with him.}
<A>__{the captain considers this.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{if somerset wants out, fuck him.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{it would be too much for him, too soon.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(to captain)}
<D>__{could we talk about this in private?}
<A>__{the captain looks at somerset, then at mills.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{that's not necessary. you're in.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{start picking up the pieces. i will shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.}
<A>__{mills stands. somerset will not look him in the eye. mills leaves, slams the door. somerset seems deflated.}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{you win, somerset. you're out.}
<A>__{insert title card}
<B>__{wednesday}
