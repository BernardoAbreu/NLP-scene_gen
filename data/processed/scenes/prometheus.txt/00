<A>__{the world turns below us, vast and slow. a rumble. a shadow sweeps over the land. we move with the shadow. we cast the shadow. landscapes slide by. reduced by altitude to abstractions: river deltas, forests and flood plains. a raw natural world. no trace of civilization. the shadow glides over mountains and glaciers. across an ocean and a pale beach. over lowland plain at the foot of a volcanic mountain it stops.}
