<L>__{interior will's room. day}
<A>__{a small cramped space in the eaves of a building. a cluttered shelf containing various objects, wedged between crumpled pieces of paper. among those we have time to observe: a skull, a mug that says a present from stratford upon avon. at infrequent intervals further pieces of crumpled paper are tossed towards the shelf. the man who is throwing them, will shakespeare, is bent over a table, writing studiously with a quill. now we see what he is writing: will is practising his signature, over and over again. "will shagsbeard...w shakspur...william shasper..." each time he is dissatisfied, and each time he crumples, and tosses it away. suddenly will becomes impatient. he jumps up and goes to the loft area in the rafters, where he sleeps, and starts to pull on his boots. at this point the door opens and henslowe walks in. he is out of breath and his feet hurt.}

<D>__{will! where is my play? tell me you have it nearly done! tell me you have it started.}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{you have begun?}
<C>__{will}

<D>__{doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move}

<D>__{no, no, we haven't the time. talk prose. where is my play?}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(tapping his forehead and heading out the door)}
<D>__{it is all locked safe in here}
<C>__{henslowe}
<D>__{god be praised!}
<P>__{(then doubt)}
<D>__{locked?}
