<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{clown. clown, can you play one of these?}
<A>__{he holds out a harmonica. helmut leans over to get it, being careful not to disturb the children.}
<C>__{sergeant hoffman}
<D>__{i got it to send home to my boy... but if it'll help...}

<C>__{sergeant hoffman}
<D>__{you won't say anything to the lieutenant.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i promise.}
<A>__{he leans back and looks at the harmonica, then he has a sudden thought as hoffman's head disappears. he leans back toward the door.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{guard... guard.}
<A>__{hoffman reappears at door.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{it's going to be dark soon. the little ones may be afraid. do you think... well... could you get some kind of a light for in here?}

<D>__{i would if i could.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i know. i know you would.}
<A>__{again hoffman's face disappears. helmut leans back and begins experimenting with the harmonica. actually he can play it only slightly, but he manages to get some sort of soft tune out of it. the camera pulls back slowly to include the children, most of who are resting peacefully, secure in helmut's presence. but suddenly a little dark haired, dark eyed girl of about six, sits upright and cries out, frightened by a bad dream. helmut reacts. the child looks around the boxcar as if she can't remember how she got there and begins crying inconsolably. some of the other children stir. helmut quickly but carefully disengages himself from the tots around him and picks his way over to the girl. he kneels beside her, and the camera moves up to tight two shot helmut, dark eyed girl the child continues crying, but more softly, he wide wet eyes on helmut.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<P>__{(she only stares at him)}
<D>__{it's all right just a bad dream.}
<A>__{he tries to put a comforting arm around her, but she shrinks away continuing to sob softly. realizing that words won't help, he turns to the harmonica for communication, serenading her with a soft but sprightly tune of his own improvisation. it is hardly a masterpiece, but it has the desired effect. the girl stops sobbing, and when helmut finishes the tune he makes a real funny face and she timorously puts a hand up to touch his make up, but pulls it back quickly. with an affectionate smile, helmut takes her hand and runs it over his face, pretending that her touch tickles him. as he laughs, the child begins to smile faintly. he shows her the traces of chalk make up on her fingers, and she giggles. his conquest is all but complete. he picks the youngster up, and holding her like a dancing partner, pretends to dance with her to a little tune he hums. she loves this and laughs outright. when helmut finally puts her down, he kisses her on the cheek and turns his cheek in an unspoken request for a return kiss. the girl shyly and quickly gives helmut's cheek a peck. grinning, helmut pats the spot where she kissed him to show his appreciation for her wonderful gift.}
