<L>__{interior loring house living room day}
<A>__{mark and vanessa usher juno and mac into the austere, spacious living room. a woman in a business suit sits on the couch with a briefcase in her lap.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{this is our attorney, gerta rauss.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(in exaggerated, growling german accent)}
<D>__{geeeerta rauuuss!}
<C>__{gerta}
<P>__{(straight)}
<D>__{nice to meet you.}
<A>__{mac seizes mark's hand and pumps it heartily.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i'm mac macguff, and this, of course, is my daughter juno.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{like the city in alaska?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{cool. well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{i will get drinks. what would everyone like? i've got pellegrino, vitamin water...}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{a maker's mark, please. up.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{she's joking. junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i also have good teeth. no cavities. we finally got fluoridated water in dancing elk.}
<A>__{she bares them frighteningly to demonstrate. vanessa stares, unflappable.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{we're fine, thank you.}
<A>__{mac and juno join mark and gerta rauss on the couch.}
<C>__{gerta}
<D>__{so, juno. first off, how far along are you?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i'm a junior.}
<C>__{gerta}
<D>__{no, i mean in your pregnancy.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{oh. uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said i was twelve weeks.}
<A>__{vanessa enters with the refreshments on a tray.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{oh, that's marvelous. so you're almost into your second trimester, then?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yeah, apparently. i'm having it on may 4.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{the tough part's almost over for you. i mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yeah, but i hardly noticed it. i'm more worried about the part where i have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{i think pregnancy is beautiful.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{well, you're lucky it's not you.}
<A>__{vanessa's looks to the ceiling.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(clearing throat)}
<D>__{so, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{well, i just have the baby and give it to you, right?}
<C>__{gerta}
<D>__{mark and vanessa are willing to negotiate an open adoption.}
<C>__{mac}
<P>__{(protective)}
<D>__{wait. what does that mean?}
<C>__{gerta}
<D>__{it means they'd send annual updates, photos, let juno know how the baby is doing as he or she grows up. of course, juno's legal rights would be terminated...}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{whoah. i don't want to see pictures. i don't need to be notified of anything. can't we just kick it old school? i could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. you know, like moses in the reeds.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{technically, that would be kickin' it old testament.}
<A>__{mark and juno lock eyes.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yeah. yeah! the way people used to do it. quick and dirty, like ripping off a band aid.}
<C>__{gerta}
<D>__{well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{shit, yeah. close it up.}
<A>__{vanessa is clearly ecstatic.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{are you looking for any other compensation?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{well, no... i'm not going to sell the baby. i just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. i'm in high school, dude. i'm ill equipped.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{you're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{i want to be a mommy so badly!}
<A>__{juno and mac stare at her.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you don't say.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{yes. heating and air conditioning.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{well, i was born to be a mother. some of us are.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{mark, are you looking forward to being a dad?}
<A>__{mark is caught off guard.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{sure, why not? i mean, every guy wants to be a father. coach soccer, help with science projects and... i don't know. fatherly stuff.}
<A>__{mac casts a subtle, dubious glance at mark.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{can i use the facilities first? being pregnant makes you pee like seabiscuit.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{sure. the powder room down here is being re tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. go up, then turn left and on your right...}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{room with a toilet, got it.}
