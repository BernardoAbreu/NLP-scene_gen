<L>__{exterior parking lot day}
<A>__{tom, standing by a limo, is speaking with sean and pj, dressed as their actual, preppy selves.}
<C>__{sean}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{hold the phone, buddy... you want us to scare this kid until he starts acting like a nice little white boy again?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{don't think you can handle it?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{of course i can handle it. i studied at juilliard for god's sake.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{fantastic.}
<A>__{tom hands them a manila envelope.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{here's some background information on brad.}
<A>__{pj pulls brad's cd from the envelope. insert cd cover it is brad, throwing the malibu sign, surrounded by women in thongs with gigantic asses. the title, in graffiti font, reads: "mali bootay!"}
<C>__{pj }
<D>__{malibootay?}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{he considers himself a 'rapper.'}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{frickin' a.}
<A>__{they all laugh. tom hands them a checklist itinerary.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{okay, so here's the story it's your basic kidnapping...}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{so we hold him for ransom?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{right. but when you see him acting ghetto and all, it pisses you off so much, you tour him around the 'hood to show him what things are really like.}
<P>__{(hands pj a list)}
<D>__{i had my guys brainstorm a few ideas...}
<C>__{pj}
<P>__{(reading list)}
<D>__{'mugging, drive by shooting, crack deal gone bad...'}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{why don't you have him steal some watermelon while you're at it?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{pays fifteen grand apiece.}
<C>__{sean and pj}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{we're in.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{wait we're kidnapping him, couldn't we get arrested?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{got you covered. mr. gluckman's a billionaire if you run into any problems with the law, we're very close with the commissioner. on the flip side, if you screw up and a single hair is touched on bradley's over privileged head, i will make sure that you do serious time. clear?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{cris... tal.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{good.}

<C>__{pj}
<D>__{congrats, my brother. we just booked another gig.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{yeah, but it's totally dangerous, dude. you know what it's like in the 'hood. we could get shot!}
<C>__{pj}
<D>__{we can handle ourselves. come on, man, it's the ultimate acting challenge.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{you know what really chaps my ass? after years of training and study, the only parts they'll give us are gangbangers. just once i'd like to play a character who has decent grammar and doesn't wear timberlands.}
<C>__{pj}
<D>__{beats gettin' dunked on by bill gluckman.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{do we even know anybody down there?}
<A>__{they think, then come up with it at the same time.}
