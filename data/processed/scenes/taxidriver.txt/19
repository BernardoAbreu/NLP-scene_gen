<A>__{tom and betsy are talking. she takes out a cigarette. he takes out matches to light it.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{try holding the match like this.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this is gotta be a game, right?}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(putting on glasses)}
<D>__{this i gotta see.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(burning fingers)}
<D>__{ouch!}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{oh, are you all right?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i'm great. always set my fingers on fire. if you want to see another trick. i do this thing with my nose.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{no. i just wanted to see if you could light it that way. the guy at the newsstand can.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, mr. asbestos...}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{he happens to be missing fingers. i first noticed when }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{is he italian?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{no, why?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you sure he's not italian?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{he's black, ok?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well, if he had been italian, they could have been shot off. sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, if they blow a job or something.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{as i said, he isn't italian. besides, i thought they just killed them.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{don't be naive. they can't kill everybody. they have different punishments for different things. like, if they kill a stool pidgeon, they leave a canary on the body. it's symbolic.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{why don't they leave a pidgeon instead of a canary?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe they don't leave a canary. don't be technical. what i'm saying is if this newsstand guy's italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{first, he's not italian. second he's not a thief. i noticed the fingers when he was getting my change the right change. two of his fingers are missing. just stubs. like they were blown away. i was putting my change in my purse when i saw him get out a cigarette. i couldn't help watching. i was dying to see how he'd light it.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{with the other hand, right?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{no, stupid. with the stubs. that's the whole pointerior}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i know that guy. his hand looks like a paw. an old black guy, the newsstand at }
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{no, this is young well, i'm never sure how old black people are but, anyway, he isn't old. that's for sure.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{show me how he did that again.}
