<L>__{exterior mesquite 1st green and sand trap day}
<A>__{boone gazes with malicious delight at tin cup's ball, buried in the front left bunker. he watches tin cup take the hoe from romeo and move down into the trap.}
<C>__{boone}
<D>__{i want to see a legitimate swing. no scooping.}
<A>__{tin cup holds up a hand like a gallery marshal requesting silence.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{stand, please. gallery, please, stand.}
<A>__{he addresses the ball, choking down on the hoe, positioning the blade at an odd angle. he hacks at the ball with an unorthodox chopping motion. the ball pops up in the air, lands on the green, releases and rolls up a foot from the hole. boone's jaw drops. tin cup hit an impossible shot with utter ease and facility.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i will finish.}
<A>__{tin cup trades romeo the shovel for the rake, takes the pin out of the hole, and pool cues the putt home. par. boone looks at his own sixty foot putt and he knows he's just been had... utterly, embarrassingly, and thoroughly. without a word he counts four hundred dollars from his roll and drops it on the green.}
<C>__{boone}
<D>__{get the hell off my course.}
