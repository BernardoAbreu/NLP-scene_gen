<A>__{this typical queens house is sandwiched between other neighboring, nearly identical houses. the morning sounds of family bickering, lawn mowers, and shouted good byes are heard coming from many houses on this close knit block. a new baby can be heard bawling inside lt's house. lt, hurried and harried, stumbles out his front door. he heads for his car, parked askew in the driveway. lt is some 40 years old. his natural swagger makes up for his lack of conventional good looks. he is obviously hung over. lt squints, pained by the sun. he fumbles with his shades, puts them on. lt's twin eight year old sons trundle out the front door of the house, bickering as they run to catch up with their daddy. the hefty twins wear ill fitting parochial school uniforms. their oversize parochial school briefcases threaten to trip them up. lt's wife, babe in arms, comes out to watch lt's lovely seven year old daughter head off toward her school on foot. many other members of lt's extended family hang out on the stoop and the lawn. as the twins cross the lawn, the bickering turns physical. they start whacking each other with the briefcases. the twins pile into lt's car.}

<A>__{the car is obviously lt's home away from home. food debris, beer cans, vodka bottles and other garbage litter the interior. an impressive hand gun is visible between the seats. an old icon of mother mary rides on the dashboard. as the twins get in, lt tries to hide the gun and the illicit detritus. to little avail. the twins pay no mind to his machinations; they have evidently seen it all before. as lt drives the twins to school, the three play wild rough house. the car swerves crazily.}
