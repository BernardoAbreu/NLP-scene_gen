<L>__{int lobby, standard hotel continuous}
<A>__{he bangs open the door to the restroom and pushes past three of the dudes, who were about to go in. they let him pass, trying to avoid attention. chev makes his way to the elevators, hits the up button. the doors open, he gets on. the dudes watch from the lobby.}
<L>__{int elevator, standard hotel continuous}
<A>__{a japanese businessman early 50s, compact and under five feet, immaculately groomed hustles on as the doors slide shut. he stands opposite chev against the wall and stares at him, expressionless.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{what’s happening, brother?}
<A>__{silence. chev takes a small bottle of pills from his coat pocket and swallows them dry. he closes his eyes and leans against the wall to steady himself as the effect of the pills washes over him. an unexpected voice breaks the silence.}
<C>__{karen chelios}
<D>__{where did i go wrong?}
<A>__{chev’s eyes snap open. the japanese businessman stares back, impassively.}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(weirded out)}
<D>__{did you say something?}
<A>__{now the japanese businessman answers but when he moves his lips, it’s the voice of a woman in her 40s.}
<C>__{karen chelios}
<D>__{like talking to the wall...}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{mom?}
<C>__{karen chelios}
<D>__{i’m amazed you remember you have a mother.}
<A>__{chev shakes his head in disbelief, tries to clear his eyes, but the hallucination persists.}
<P>__{karen chelios (cont’d)}
<D>__{you never call, you never write... i haven’t seen you since you ran out at 16...}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(falling right into it)}
<D>__{right, with you popping valium like tic tacs and balling some new asshole every two weeks... why wouldn’t i stick around for entertainment like that?}
<C>__{karen chelios}
<D>__{that’s hurtful.}
<A>__{chev is an instant ball of regret.}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{mom, i got no time for this...}
<A>__{the japanese businessman cuts him off this time the voice is orlando’s.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{you got no time, period.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{orlando?}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{you a persistent motherfucker, chev chelios, i’ll give you that.}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(reacting)}
<D>__{this is weird.}
<C>__{orlando}
<D>__{but you know this has got to stop sometime. what do you think you are, michael myers? they pop you and you just keep gettin up?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{i’m the terminator.}
<A>__{the japanese businessman does another transformation this time into alex.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you was that, maybe. but there’s a new gun in town.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{don’t tell me you’re talking about your bro, def lepard.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{he did you pretty good, didn’t he?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{yeah, not so much. i don’t get it why didn’t you guys just cut me up alive when you had the chance?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{verona said you was chev chelios a.k.a. death on two legs. he said you probably been a contract killer since grade school.}
<A>__{as he speaks, alex’s voice transforms again, this time into chev’s... he’s now talking to a mirror of himself...}
<C>__{mirror chev}
<D>__{bipolar. sadomasochistic tendencies. adrenaline junkie. addicted to violence... probably spends every day of his life looking for the big thrill, the big rush. cutting up a guy like that while he screams in his own blood and excrement would be like... like a gift... a warrior’s death... hell, you’d probably get off on it...}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{did you rehearse this?}
<C>__{mirror chev}
<D>__{no, this was the best way for a guy like you: a slow, ticking clock... winding down... inevitable... non negotiable... until...}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{who the hell are you, anyway?}
<C>__{mirror chev}
<D>__{don’t you know?}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(soberly)}
<D>__{i think i’m starting to figure it out.}
<C>__{mirror chev}
<D>__{yeah, well, better late than never.}
<P>__{(conversational)}
<D>__{you know you’re going to die up there.}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{yeah, maybe.}
<A>__{the camera holds chev’s gaze for a long moment, unflinching.}
<P>__{chev (cont’d)}
<D>__{but i’m taking you with me.}
<A>__{reverse, cu: the japanese businessman has transformed into a giant blue ghost, pulsing silently.}
