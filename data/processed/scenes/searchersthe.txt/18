<T>__{the six horsemen are:}
<A>__{captain, the reverend sam clayton, a big man with frosty blue eyes, graying hair, a bristly full mustache and the air of grave and resolute authority. he is a minister of the gospel with a .44 on his hip. lars jorgensen, the edwards' neighbor, is a harried little man, scandinavian. as we shall find out soon, he has a brisk and buxom wife and a rather astonishing brood of children. brad jorgensen is one of these: sandy haired, brash, amiable, impulsive. he is in his early twenties. charlie maccorry, slightly older than brad, is sergeant of company a of the rangers. (he is also company a.) charlie is a taciturn, gently spoken, competent man, clearly patterned by his association with captain, the rev. sam. mose harper is an old scout a walking bone rack, yet capable of tireless feats of endurance. some think him "tetched" yet he has managed to endure to his age during a time and in a region where few men lived to see their grandchildren. he wears a ragged dark overcoat in all weather, a narrow brimmed hat with a feather in its band. ed nesby is a rancher and homesteader in his mid thirties; resolute, honest, self effacing; nothing picturesque or dramatic about him; just a solid citizen and a realist.}
