<A>__{ronnie looks at the colorful flowers in the glass refrigerator. the flower salesman walks up to ronnie.}
<C>__{flower salesman}

<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you have?}
<C>__{flower salesman}
<D>__{oh yeah, i heard about last night. brandi is quite the woman. congratulations, my friend. or should i say, welcome to the club?}
<A>__{the flower salesman winks and starts laughing. ronnie doesn't. it gets weird so the flower salesman stops.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what color of roses do the women like anyway?}
<C>__{flower salesman}
<D>__{well, it depends on what you are trying to say. the white roses symbolize innocence and purity.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah, we're way past the color white if you know what i mean. what about the yellow ones?}
<C>__{flower salesman}
<D>__{joy, happiness, appreciation.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i don't even know what to make of that.}
<C>__{flower salesman}
<D>__{the pink rose means thank you.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{nexterior}
<C>__{flower salesman}
<D>__{the red rose is the most powerful. it symbolizes love.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{why didn't you just say that? i'm a busy man here.}
<C>__{flower salesman}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{forget it. give me a big bag of the red ones.}
<C>__{flower salesman}
<D>__{um, can i ask a question?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{flower salesman}
<D>__{do you really like brandi?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i've only been on one date with her, but i could see myself being with her for all of eternity.}
<C>__{flower salesman}
<D>__{well, in that case, the greatest symbol of love is just a single red rose.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{seems like a big bag of roses would be more love than just one, but i guess you're the expert. gimme one.}
<A>__{the flower salesman takes a single red rose from the case and hands it to ronnie.}
