<A>__{sam. it is as though he alone is there with molly. his eyes are full of tears. he can barely move. his hand glides slowly down molly's cheek. he seems to be in a state of ecstasy and pain. the experience is more than he can bear. he pulls back.}

<A>__{molly reaches out, takes sam's hand, and guides it to her soft lips. sam can barely breathe. he seems totally absorbed in the experience, the sensation of human flesh. his eyes are absolutely still and full of light. he seems to be glowing. gently, molly takes sam's arm and guides him to his feet. effortlessly, she draws him to the center of the huge loft. with great tenderness, she puts her arms around him and before he knows what is happening, they are dancing. it is a strange, touching image, reminiscent of their first night in their new home. sam reaches out and slowly draws his fingers down over her face, caressing her forehead, her cheeks, her lips. she stands motionless. her face shines. she knows beyond all doubt that it is him.}
