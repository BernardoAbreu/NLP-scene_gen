<A>__{hazel sits at dinner with her parents. she is barely touching her food.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{the problem, of course, is that there's no way of knowing that your last good day is your "last good day." at the time, it's just another decent day.}

<A>__{by now michael is crying too. they all are.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i worry that you won't have a life. that you'll sit around all day with no me to look after and stare at the walls and be miserable or off yourselves or something.}
<C>__{frannie}

<A>__{she takes that in. it rings true to her. hazel nods.}
<C>__{frannie}
<D>__{i don't just sit around, you know.}
