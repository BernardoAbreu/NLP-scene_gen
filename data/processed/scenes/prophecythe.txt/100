<L>__{interior kiva night}
<A>__{under the village, beneath the surface of the butte, is the large communal kiva room. accessible by a single ladder through a single smoke hole, it is down here that the village performs its enemy ghost way for mary. the little girl is there, attended by her grandmother, sitting stoically still on a blanket as grey horse, grasping his painted prayer sticks, by the glow of a fire chants the enemy ghost way cure. katherine's eyes sting in the smokey air as she watches grey horse take from his case small handfulls of colored sand that he pours in fine patterns onto the floor. the whole bitter sky clan surrounds them. old, lined faces. a small, dying people here to support its last granddaughter.}
