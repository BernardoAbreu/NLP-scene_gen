<L>__{exterior magellan airlock lift}
<A>__{holloway roars into the lift at speed, the rover skidding almost into the opposite wall. watts leaps down. the storm wall catches up to them. screaming winds rip through the lift. dust fills the air. visibility plunges toward zero.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{help me unload!}
<A>__{she pulls at the tarp. it tears halfway free and fills with wind, snapping taut with such violence that watts is hurled out into the storm.}
<B>__{in the gale}
<A>__{watts tumbles helplessly: a leaf in the wind. crashes into a metal stanchion. clings, the wind knocked out of her. ears ringing. nothing but static in her headset.}
<B>__{in the lift}
<A>__{holloway stares in shock at the place where watts vanished.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{jocelyn!}
<A>__{with inhuman reflexes david reacts. grabs a tether. latches it to his suit. locks it to an anchor point on the wall. dives into the storm. a ballet nearly too fast to follow.}
<B>__{in the gale}
<A>__{david lets the wind take him. skids across the ground, controlling his trajectory. he hits the stanchion where watts is lodged with a clang as if he were made of iron. watts stares at him in mute astonishment. he locks her suit to his. activates the tether unit's winch. it whirs, reeling them in through the hurricane.}
<B>__{in the lift}
<A>__{holloway and the other crewmen haul watts and david back inside. holloway and watts embrace fiercely as the lift rises toward the safety of the ship. the crewmen bundle the rover's tarp wrapped cargo into a sealed dumbwaiter that rises independently into the ship.}
