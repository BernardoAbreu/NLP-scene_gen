<A>__{the peacock whitechapel people are happily drinking and singing and laughing. bytes and the boy are keeping a watchful eye on the night porter, who is making a deal with a couple of men at a table. they hand over a few coins and follow the night porter out of the pub. bytes finishes his beer and thumps the glass down on the bar. he wipes his mouth with his sleeve and he and the boy casually follow the other three men out. bytes and the boy stand by the pub door, watching the men cross the street and go to the back gate of the hospital which the night porter unlocks, and leaves unlocked, but closed, behind them. they walk into bedstead square, laughing quietly. bytes crosses the street and goes to the gate. he walks along the iron fence and watches the night porter and his "customers". he stops and waits to see where they go. the night porter stands the two men before a window and motions for them to wait. he goes through a door into the hospital. after a few moments the window opens wide, and there, neatly framed and silhouetted, stand merrick and the night porter, gripping merrick's neck. the two men outside start back in shock, but stand mesmerized by what they see. we hear the laughter of the night porter echo across the empty square. bytes smiles broadly and says softly to himself.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{so, there you are, my boy, my treasure.}
<B>__{a sitting room}
<A>__{we see a small circle of women having tea and gossip. one of their daughters, off to the side, is reading a newspaper society page.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{mummy, listen to this!}
<C>__{mummy}
<D>__{hush, jennifer, can't you see mummy's talking?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{but it's about mrs. kendal, mummy! the actress you go on so much about!}
<A>__{she has got the women's attention.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{"mrs. kendal, always at the forefront of fashion and form, was seen leaving the london the other afternoon. no, dear readers, the most facile actress of our day has not been taken ill, but rather said she was 'visiting a friend'. and who was the lucky recipient of this attention? quick enquiries proved it to be none other than mr. john merrick, the elephant man, with whom our readers are undoubtedly familiar. after a chat of three quarters of an hour, mrs. kendal was kind enough to leave mr. merrick with an autographed portrait of herself. owing to a disfigurement of the most extreme nature, mr. merrick has never been properly presented to london society. but knowing that wherever mrs. kendal goes, others inevitably follow, the questions arises: will london society present itself to him?"}
<B>__{london hospital gate}
<A>__{a carriage draws up in the street outside the hospital. a nicely dressed woman sticks her head out the window, looks around and scowls disappointedly. nearby is parked another carriage and driver.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(to her driver)}
<D>__{parkins, whose carriage is that?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{well mum, that looks like alexander, lord waddington's driver.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{lord and lady waddington! well. drive back to the house.}
<P>__{(indicating her clothing)}
<D>__{i can't be seen in this.}
<A>__{they drive off. above merrick's bookshelf we see a row of framed pictures of prettily smiling society women. mrs. kendal has started a fad. we pan slowly by them and down to merrick's table where his mother and mrs. kendal have their place of honor. the cathedral is also there. beside it is a modest tea service. we now see a gentleman standing behind a seated lady. they hold teacups. they are both very attractive and empty headed, and seem on the verge of screaming. they smile at merrick who has been talking the whole while. merrick holds an elegant, silvertipped walking stick across his lap, and admires a ring that only fits his little finger.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{thank you for your kind gifts. i can't say enough about this ring. and this walking stick is ever so dashing. so much more elegant than my old one. more tea?}
<A>__{the lady and gentleman nod nervously. john takes the teapot from the service and refills their cups. the lady's hand shakes, rattling the cup against the saucer.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{if you have a chill i can close the window.}
<C>__{the lady}
<D>__{oh no, no, no, i'm fine. please... i mean, thank you.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i don't get out as often as i'd like to, for some people do find my appearance disturbing. of course, i can't fault them.}
<A>__{we see the smiling pictures.}
<C>__{merrick }
<D>__{people are often frightened by what they don't understand.}
<A>__{we see the picture of merrick's mother.}
<C>__{merrick }
<D>__{and it is hard to understand, even for myself, for you see, mother was so very beautiful.}
<A>__{we draw close to his mother's picture.}
<C>__{merrick }
<D>__{how's your tea?}
<B>__{the receiving room}
<A>__{treves walks the lord and lady, their faces locked in terrible silence, to the door. mothershead, at her desk, watches them pass with great disapproval.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{watery headed bunch.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i regret that i must leave you here, m' lord, m' lady. thank you so much for coming. it was an act of the greatest charity.}
<C>__{lady waddington}
<D>__{oh no, mr. treves, the pleasure was all ours. good day.}
<A>__{as they turn to go, their faces drop, their loathing undisguised. treves closes the door. he goes to mothershead.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{incredible, isn't it? well, i think john has had enough visitors for one day, mothershead. i've got a lecture at the college, i will be back this evening.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{excuse me, sir. i'd like to have a word with you.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{oh?... well, quickly please, mothershead, i'm overdue.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{i can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{now mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for john. he relishes contact with people outside the hospital...}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{but you saw them, sir. they couldn't hide their disgust. they don't care anything for john, they're just trying to impress their friends.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{aren't you being just a little harsh, mothershead? you yourself hardly treated john with much loving kindness when he first arrived.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{i bathed him, didn't i? i fed him and cleaned up after him! if loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, i did treat him with loving kindness, and i'm not ashamed to say it.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{you're right, mothershead, please forgive me... of course, i appreciate everything you've done for john, and i'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. but, i'm the physician in charge and i must do what i think best. i'm also very late, so please forgive me.}
<A>__{he starts to go. mothershead steps in front of him, detaining him.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{if you ask me, sir, he's just being stared at all over again.}
<A>__{merrick's room we pan across merrick's bookcase, now quite full, and we see a few titles: "moll flanders", "emma', "jane eyre", "pamela", and then to merrick. he and treves are reading poetry together.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{when will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? when will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? when will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? when will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{never, oh! never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats nothing will die.}
<A>__{merrick closes his book and sits silently for a moment.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{mr. treves, there is something i've been meaning to ask you for some time...}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{yes, john?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{...can you cure me?}
<A>__{treves is taken aback. he considers, then says tentatively.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{no john, i can't. i can care for you, but i can't cure you.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i thought as much.}
<A>__{merrick rises. treves ponders over what merrick has just said. he looks at merrick and something very odd happens. merrick is looking levelly at him. for the first and only time, we see expression on his face. it is a calm, knowing look, almost a benign smile. at that very moment there is a bright flash of light behind merrick's head, seemingly from the window. treves blinks, unable to comprehend what has just happened. when he looks again, the moment has passed. merrick, his back to treves, moves to the bookcase to replace the volume.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{john...?}
<A>__{there's a knock at the door.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{nora enters with a brown paper parcel tied with string. merrick says nothing.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{are you looking for me, sister?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{no sir, mr. merrick.}
<P>__{(to merrick)}
<D>__{i have something for you.}
<A>__{she puts the parcel on the table and opens it. we see several squares of new cardboard, a cutting knife, a pastepot, and a few brushes and some painterior}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i thought these things would be helpful with your cathedral.}
<A>__{merrick examines the materials with reverence, and thanks her profusely. treves is moved and a little disconcerted. merrick lays the things aside carefully and begins to pull the crude spires from the discarded box. nora smiles at the busy merrick and exits.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{the cathedral is coming along nicely.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(bending over the model)}
<D>__{yes, soon i will start the main spire, but i must finish these columns first, how kind of her!}
<A>__{treves notices to his dismay that the growths on merrick's head are larger. he finds it very difficult to disguise his concern.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{how blind of me. is there anything else, john, anything at all that i could get for you?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{oh no! there is nothing! i have everything, you have given me everything i could possibly want. i am happy every hour of the day. i only wish there was something i could give to you.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{please john, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. something just for yourself. isn't there something you would like to have?}
<A>__{merrick is silent. he goes over to his cloak, reaches into it and pulls out a folded up advertisement. he hands it to treves, who examines it closely. it is an advertisement for an elegant gentleman's dressing bag, boasting ivory brushes, silver fittings and moroccan silk lining.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{you want a dressing bag, john?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{you don't think it's too gaudy, do you?}
<B>__{hallway}
<A>__{mrs. mothershead finds treves walking slowly down the hall, looking at the ad.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{mr. treves, some more books arrived for mr. merrick.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{thank you, mothershead. have a porter put them in my office.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<P>__{(seeing the ad)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{a dressing bag.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{very smart indeed.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{yes. john wants it.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{a dressing bag?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{you don't think it's too gaudy, do you.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{john thinks it's very dashing. something no gentleman should be without. i'm inclined to agree.}
<A>__{he walks off.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{a dressing bag?}
<A>__{merrick's room (dusk) merrick is still at his cathedral working away. suddenly, he looks up at the window and the night porter is standing there smiling wickedly, pointing a finger at him.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{night!}
