<L>__{interior skylight apex day}
<A>__{meanwhile, a member of ant team six the stupidest member, in fact, waits at the very top of the tunnel, where it narrows almost to a pointerior he's hanging from a winch, and has a little hammer and chisel in his hand. he's whistling, awaiting instructions.}
<L>__{interior mega tunnel day}
<A>__{z emerges from the tunnel he's dug, spits a load of dirt out of his mouth and wipes his hands off. nearby, bala lies there, bound and gagged.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{bala!}
<A>__{z unties bala and undoes her gag.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{z! you came back!}
<A>__{they hug.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{why do they have you tied up here?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{there's something going on, z }
<A>__{from here, z can see far down the tunnel to where the crowd is gathering.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{they're having a ceremony to open the megatunnel...}
<A>__{we can hear the sound of water shifting somewhere above. he looks up the tunnel...in the distance, we can make out the silhouete of the commando set to break open the wall...}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{bala, that that lake we found i think the tunnel's right underneath it!}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{ formica's going to flood thecolony!!! that's what he meant when said there were too many ants!}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{oh no...}
<A>__{bala looks too shocked to move. z starts pushing her into the tunnel he made, and starts heading down towards the crowd.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{z! what are you doing?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{i know it's crazy, but i can't just leave. don't argue with me. if i've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world. or beans. something like that. anyway, i've got to warn the others.}
<A>__{z looks into bala's eyes.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{head for the surface, bala. if i don't make it, well...we'll always have insectopia.}
<A>__{z kisses bala. then he starts running down the tunnel towards the crowd...}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(following him)}
<D>__{z!!! wait for me!}
