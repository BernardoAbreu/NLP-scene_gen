<L>__{interior east wilmington high school locker room night}
<A>__{present day. post match. randy, pushing 50, still with the same long, dyed blond mane, sits on a bench in the boys locker room of a wilmington, delaware high school. chyron: 20 years later he pulls off his purple spandex wrestling tights. lime green ram's horns run up the sides. they're the same kind of tights as in the `80s pics and may well be the actual same pair. naked except for a jockstrap, randy takes a breath. achy, sweaty, saggy, exhausted. a battered warrior. scars all over his body. despite the rough shape he's in, it's clear he's just given it his all in the ring. he swigs down a few pills with a beer. promoter scott brumberg, a heavyset man in a mets jersey with brumberg 44 on the back, approaches.}
