<L>__{interior kitchen. flood street. london. 1974. dawn.}
<A>__{laughter voices on the approach }
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{thanks ma, that was terrific! i really feel i've got a handle on it now.}
<A>__{carol and margaret entering kitchen, still giddy from their adventure.}
<C>__{carol }
<D>__{you should have seen us, pa.}
<A>__{denis in his dressing gown burning toast and attempting to make breakfast }
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{have you been trying to make breakfast? for goodness sake, denis!}
<A>__{denis scrapes down the toast, eggs boiling in the pan.}
<C>__{denis}
<D>__{i can boil a bloody egg.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{mummy took me for a test drive we went absolutely everywhere. all over the place }
<C>__{margaret}
<P>__{(sudden cutting in)}
<D>__{i've decided. i'm going to run.}
<A>__{margaret smiles, a growing resolution gripping her.}
<C>__{denis}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i'm going to run for leader of the party.}
<A>__{carol's utter disappointment on seeing she has lost margaret already.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{silly me!}
<A>__{carol storms out of the kitchen.}
<C>__{denis}
<P>__{(calling after)}
<D>__{good luck!}
<C>__{carol }
<D>__{all the time i thought i was having a driving lesson, it was all about my mother, just for a change!}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{what's she on about?}
<C>__{denis}
<D>__{it's her driving test this morning!}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{oh, right. of course.}
<B>__{a beat.}
<C>__{denis}
<D>__{are you saying you want to be prime minister?}
<C>__{margaret}
<P>__{(with false patience)}
<D>__{what i'm saying is that someone must force the point, say the unsayable. none of these men have the guts.}
<A>__{margaret sees the burnt toast and energetically starts clearing up and putting more bread under the grill.}
<C>__{denis}
<D>__{the prime minister has been very loyal to you, mt.}
<A>__{he tries, with a trembling hand, to scoop boiled eggs from the pan.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{but he's weak, and he's weakened the party. one must know when to go.}
<P>__{(glancing at him)}
<D>__{you're shaking.}
<A>__{she reaches out.}
<C>__{denis}
<D>__{i can do it!}
<A>__{denis pulls his arm away, sending boiled eggs flying.}
<B>__{silence.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{goodness me! what is the matter with everyone this morning?}
<A>__{a beat. he looks utterly fragile.}
<C>__{denis}
<D>__{i've told you what the matter is. the business is a bit rocky at the moment and the doctor thinks i need a rest.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{and do you need a rest?}
<A>__{it's almost challenging. he doesn't answer and she doesn't notice.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{we both know that it's highly unlikely that i would ever be elected leader, i will never be elected leader. but i will run. i will run. just to nip at their heels and make them reaffirm the principles on which the conservative party must stand. there's so much to do.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{denis}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{you're insufferable, margaret, do you know that?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{denis, you married someone who is committed to public service, you knew that. and it is my duty }
<C>__{denis}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{don't call it duty. it's ambition which has got you this far. ambition. and the rest of us, me, the children, we can all go to hell!}
<A>__{the slam of the door, denis gone }
<D>__{denis (o.s.) (cont'd) don't worry about me, i will be fine!}
