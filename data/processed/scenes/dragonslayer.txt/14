<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{dragon country day the travelers descend a mountain pass and emerge through a wrack of cloud into a gray and cheerless region. fire blackened trees dot the barren landscape. as they reach the flatlands, the urlanders instinctively pick up the pace. galen slows to inspect the weird surroundings. valerian trots past him.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{come on. don't dawdle here.}
<A>__{galen falls into step with her.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{the whole kingdom like this?}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{no. we're near the lair. keep moving.}
<A>__{galen looks around with new interest.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{over there. doesn't matter. we're in no danger if we just pass through quickly.}
<A>__{galen stops. high on the slope beside them is a gaping fissure.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i see it. let's have a look.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{but galen is already toiling up the incline.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{greil! malkin! help!}
<A>__{the travelers turn to see what's the matter.}
<B>__{the lair}
<A>__{galen approaches the lair, pausing beside a wooden post with iron manacles dangling from it. he fingers them thoughtfully. malkin, greil and valerian rush up behind him, their faces drawn with worry.}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{look, you don't have to do this. we know you're a fine young magician. none better. there's no need to prove it to us.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{are there other entrances?}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{no. one's enough.}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{come on. the road's this way. we'll tell everybody how close you got.}
<C>__{galen}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{no smoke. how do you know it's in there?}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{don't be a fool. come away now and live to tell about it.}
<A>__{instead, galen starts into the crack. greil and malkin hasten away, but valerian lingers, watching in mounting frustration as galen probes further and further into the lair. she picks up a fistful of stones and throws them at him.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{go ahead! you're going to die! what a fine trick that will be!}
<A>__{but galen is lost in the gloom. she flees.}
<B>__{underground}
<A>__{galen puts his hand on the rugged wall: the rocks are hot to the touch. something glinting on the floor catches galen's eye: an irridescent disk, a dragon scale. it flashes the colors of the rainbow as galen examines it. all at once the ground shudders; chunks of rock fall from the ceiling. a pall of smoke billows up from the depths.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{galen staggers out of the fissure coughing and gagging in a swirl of smoke. there is no sign of the urlanders. he throws down his pack, climbs onto a huge boulder and surveys the massive cliffs rising behind the lair. he grasps the amulet and closes his eyes.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{now, great mountain, hear my command: terrae lapsus consignet latibulum draconis! evanescat latibulum draconis!}
<B>__{landslide}
<A>__{with a thunderous splitting sound, the entire top of the cliff pitches forward and topples onto the lower half of the mountain, sweeping tons of debris into the air. boulders the size of houses bound down the mountain toward the magician. eyes wide with awe, he turns and runs for his life. even as he careens down the slope, chunks of rock rumble past. one catches him at the knee and sends him flying. he covers his head and joins the landslide. finally the dust lifts and he finds himself in a gully face to face with the cowering urlanders. they look with real fear at the man who just conjured up the apocalypse. tattered and torn, covered with dirt, galen climbs up out of the shelter for a look at his handiwork.}
<B>__{landscape}
<A>__{the territory has been drastically transformed: the dragon's lair is now buried beneath hundreds of tons of broken granite. the urlanders look upon the new landscape with stupefaction. galen grins a triumphant split lip grin that fails to win them over. presently they back away and run off down the trail, valerian in their midst. galen's grin fades.}
