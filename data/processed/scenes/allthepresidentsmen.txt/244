<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{this is where the source burning scene would come but i am not writing it for this version.}
<A>__{my reasons are as follows: (1) it is a complicated long scene to put down; (2) we are terribly late in our story; (3) it would mean, here, two hours into the movie, we are bringing in an entirely new character; the fbi agent's head to whom they go, and i think that is unnecessary and confusing; and (4) most important, i think the characters have been abused enough in this version we have added the sedam scene and they are berated more in this version by the creep people before things turn. (5) finally, all this can show in reality is that they are desperate, and i would rather let the actors give that to us. i feel that it would be a genuine error at this time in the flick to go into the convolutions of how it's bad manners for a reporter to burn a source, if we've got anything going by this point, i can't conceive of much an audience will be less interested in than the reporters misbehaving. however, if the scene is requested next time through, i shall be only too happy to oblige. what i would like to do is cut from the fbi saying "fuck you fuck you fuck you" and locking his door to the following: woodward and bernstein walking in the rain. it's pouring as they leave fbi headquarters and they are in anguish.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(after a while)}
<D>__{woodward?}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{what was the mistake? do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? they couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?}
<C>__{woodward}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{only everything...}
<A>__{they are soaked, nearby is a garbage can, they grab papers, hold them over their heads, start to walk. now }
<B>__{camera moves up higher to reveal}
<A>__{the papers they grabbed were the post front page. (this happened.) and as they walked, the haldeman story was on their heads. hold on the reporters walking miserably through the rain. now }
