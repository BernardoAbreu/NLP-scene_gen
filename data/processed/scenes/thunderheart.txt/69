<L>__{exterior wounded knee memorial night}
<A>__{the le baron just sits parked, headlights making the night fog crawl up from the base of the old tomb, along the fence. the driver's door opens slowly. and ray steps out. he walks through the arch. into the small fenced area. up to the stone which is overgrown with stubborn weeds, half hidden in mist. ray studies the tomb. pov: the names on the stone are chiseled vertically:}
<B>__{chief standing bear mr. high hawk afraid of bear}
<A>__{weeds are grown up over the rest of the names. ray's hands clear them, grab at them and rip them away from more names:}
<B>__{pretty hawk blue american sherman horn cloud}
<A>__{with frantic abandon, ray is ripping weeds away. he drops to his knees, clearing weeds.}
<B>__{strong fox thunder heart}
<A>__{moving down and then suddenly back up to the name:}
<B>__{thunder heart}
<A>__{reverse on ray kneeling in the weeds, the wind getting restless around him, screaming the way plains winds do but only these winds are filled with a whistling. what sounds like eagle bone whistles, piping shrill. ray kneels before the marker, staring at the name on the stone, his hair thrown around by the wind that drives across the grass, whistling eagles, building to an unbearable, pitch. ray stares at the name as if he is looking through a small hole into another world. a world that frightens him. he gets up and backs away from the stone, through the gate. and gets back in his car, quickly. he takes off.}
