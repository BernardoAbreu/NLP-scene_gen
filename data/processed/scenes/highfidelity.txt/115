<A>__{liz and rob sit in the back of the dark, smallish nondenominational room. at the front is a coffin, resting on a stand. laura, her younger sister jo, and her mother sit in the front row, listening to the minister.}

<D>__{...now and forever, amen.}
<A>__{he nods "offstage," and a muffled mechanical noise is heard. the coffin begins to lower through a trap door beneath it. a low, baleful human howl is heard, starting quietly but gaining in volume.}
<C>__{rob }
