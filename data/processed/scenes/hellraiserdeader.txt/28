<L>__{interior subway station night}
<A>__{a thunderous noise trails a subway car as it streaks out of a station. lit with cold fluorescent light, amy, now dressed, with her sunglasses in place, slides her card through the slot and shoves through the turnstile. she descends the long, non working escalator the only one on it at this time of night. she reaches the subway platform. it is virtually empty. amy has come down stairs that land her just about in the middle. she scans the far end of the platform, past a lone figure in a shiny green plastic raincoat who lies motionless on a bench. a couple middle aged guys in security uniforms, maybe heading for some night shift somewhere, stand, not moving, hands thrust in pockets. she turns back to the bench but the figure in the shiny green raincoat is gone. she takes up a position at the far end of the platform. she waits. a moment later, a bit of a breeze starts moving her hair. a few seconds later, a train comes roaring into the station. amy watches the car pass her, one by one, as the train slows. the train is virtually empty. one car after the next rolls by as the train slows. finally, as the train moves slowly to a stop, a car different from the others comes in. this one, for some odd reason, seems to have newspaper covering all the windows taped up from the inside. one of the doors of the covered car comes to a stop directly in front of the spot where amy is standing the spot marked by the stenciled puzzle box. there's a pause, then the doors slide open just one the one set in front of amy. the others stay closed. the interior of the car is dark the lights, apparently, are not working. a tall odd looking man in a conductor's uniform is standing there. he gestures toward the adjoining car.}
