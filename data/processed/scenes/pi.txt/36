<L>__{interior subway station public bench night}
<A>__{the station is strangely silent. it is also extremely rundown. the tracks are rusted and fucked up. all we hear is the sound of dripping water. the sound is warped and grows and morphs until it's downright scary. max sits on a bench sucking down pills. his head begins to hurt. he touches the right side of his scalp and nubs it. as the blood surges through his head it brings him waves of pain. he gags several times. then the pain lets loose and all max wants to do is die. he smashes the side of his head with his fist. across the tracks on the far platform he sees someone. for a moment max's pain dissipates. his view is obscured by the columns. max gets up and sees the young hasidic man from earlier staring at him. the man stares at max without any emotion. max notices blood dropping from the man's right hand. max looks at the man's face and sees for a split second his own face staring back.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{max charges up a flight of stairs. he crosses a passage over the tracks and flies down the stairs to the other side of the platform. the man is gone. a pool of blood sits where the man was. max touches it with his toe. it's sticky. he notices a trail of blood leading off from the pool. he follows it around a corner where it leads into a corner. he notices something strange in the shadows. he carefully advances on it. hiding in the shadows is what looks like a small piece of brain. it seems to be moving slightly. max uses a pen in his jacket to carefully touch it. suddenly, max hears a train's honk honk behind him. max spins around. nothing is there but silence. he turns back to the gray matter. he touches it again. once again, he hears the deafening honk honk. max spins around, but nothing is there. frustrated, he pushes his pen deep into the brain fiber ripping apart. suddenly, a train is barreling down on max. seconds from impact, max screams!!!}
