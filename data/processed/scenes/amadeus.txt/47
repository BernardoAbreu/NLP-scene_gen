<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{why? would god choose an obscene child to be his instrument? it was not to be believed! this piece had to be an accident. it had to be!}
<L>__{interior palace dining room day 1780's}
<A>__{at the table sits the emperor joseph ii, eating his frugal dinner and sipping goat's milk. he is an intelligent, dapper man of forty, wearing a military uniform. around him but standing, are his chamberlain, johann von strack: stiff and highly correct. count orsini rosenberg: a corpulent man of sixty, highly conscious of his position as director of the opera. baron von swieten, the imperial librarian: a grave but kindly and educated man in his mid fifties. first kapellmeister giuseppe bonno: very italian, cringing and time serving, aged about seventy. and salieri, wearing decorous black, as usual. at a side table, two imperial secretaries, using quill pens and inkstands, write down everything of importance that is said.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{how good is he, this mozart?}
<C>__{von swieten}
<D>__{he's remarkable, majesty. i heard an extraordinary serious opera of his last month. idomeneo, king of crete. orsini rosenberg that? a most tiresome piece. i heard it, too.}
<C>__{von swieten}
<D>__{tiresome? orsini rosenberg a young man trying to impress beyond his abilities. too much spice. too many notes.}
<C>__{von swieten}
<D>__{majesty, i thought it the most promising work i've heard in years.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{ah ha. well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. we could use a good german composer in vienna, surely?}
<C>__{von strack}
<D>__{i agree, majesty, but i'm afraid it's not possible. the young man is still in the pay of the archbishop.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{very small pay, i imagine. i'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. say, an opera in german for our national theatre.}
<C>__{von swieten}
<D>__{excellent, sire! orsini rosenberg but not german, i beg your majesty! italian is the proper language for opera. all educated people agree on that.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{ah ha. what do you say, chamberlain?}
<C>__{von strack}
<D>__{in my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. plain german. for plain people.}
<A>__{he looks defiantly at orsini rosenberg.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{ah ha. kapellmeister?}
<C>__{bonno}
<P>__{(italian accent)}
<D>__{majesty, i must agree with herr dirretore. opera is an italian art, solamente. german is scusate too bruta for singing, too rough.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{ah ha. court composer, what do you say?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i think it is an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna, majesty. it should really infuriate the archbishop beyond measure if that is your majesty's intention.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{you are cattivo, court composer.}
<P>__{(briskly, to von strack)}
<D>__{i want to meet this young man. chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.}
<C>__{von strack}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{well. there it is.}
