<L>__{interior maharet desert mansion night}
<A>__{mael leads jesse down the hall. she stares ahead at what looks like statues standing in the shadows. her eyes widen as the statues come to life: armand, pandora, khayman, marius are talking in hushed tones, gathered before maharet's "great family tree." camera sweeps over the endless lines, the rows of names that stretch down the stone wall across the floor, filling room after room. the ancients all stare, deeply moved. maharet turns to them.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{we see now what akasha means to do. rule as queen again.}
<P>__{(pointing to the great family)}
<D>__{this is why we must fight akasha!}
<A>__{maharet looks around, determined, challenging each of the immortals.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{for the sake of all mortals. she must be stopped, or the mortal world will end.}
<A>__{the ancients fall silent as they take this in. they gaze again at maharet's great family, humbled for a moment by her life's passion.}
<C>__{mael}
<D>__{but is there a way? we don't know.}
<C>__{khayman}
<D>__{when she opens herself to give her blood, she is vulnerable.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{then we weaken her. drain her of almost all her blood, but leave her just one drop.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{we can't take that chance. we must finish her.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{if she dies, we all die.}
<C>__{pandora}
<D>__{we're damned no matter what happens.}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{perhaps.}
<A>__{maharet gazes at them, her mind working... pandora, khayman, mael gaze at each other, still uncertain.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{and what about lestat?}
<C>__{maharet}
<D>__{lestat has joined with akasha. he is lost to us now. he is never coming back.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i don't believe that.}
