<L>__{exterior platoon pc night}
<A>__{towards the end of this voice over, we cut to sgt. barnes moving towards the platoon pc. a powerful face, a quiet, angry fixed stare, a thick trimmed moustache that helps conceal a network of plastic surgery grafts and scars. the distortion from the jaw up the left side of his face to his forehead, punctuated by a severe indentation above the left eye where a bullet once penetrated his skull. walking with him is sgt. o'neill as they join wolfe, sgts. elias and warren at the platoon pc where they're huddled over maps. warren is a black, thin, tall, paranoid man with untrusting eyes, silent and bitter.}
<C>__{barnes}
<P>__{(to all, almost pleased about it)}
<D>__{we got boo coo movement. 3rd battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here.}
<P>__{(the men react with wary silence)}
<C>__{o'neill}
<P>__{(eager to elaborate)}
<D>__{yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. baad shit.}
<A>__{barnes inflects his next words at wolfe, who is worried.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{yeah, they got two lieutenants and a captain.}
<C>__{wolfe}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{elias quiet. barnes studying the map.}
<C>__{wolfe }
<P>__{(to barnes)}
<D>__{who do you want on ambush, sergeant?}
<A>__{barnes doesn't bother acknowledging the question, barely glancing at the lieutenant, to him a necessary evil. everybody knows who's really in charge of the platoon. barnes flicks his gaze to elias.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{elias you take your squad and i will take tex and francis from your squad.}
<P>__{(to warren)}
<D>__{we move out in two zero mikes.}
<P>__{(concluding)}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{i thought it was o'neill's turn tonight.}
<A>__{they all look at each other. o'neill spits in the dust, a freckled, short red head with a hard worried face, a lifer, 30 going on 60.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{shit! morehouse and sal are short. fu sheng's going on r&r, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. you got the fresh meat elias.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(to barnes)}
<D>__{they don't know shit barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{so what am i going to do! get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the world can get his beauty fucking sleep!}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{hey o'neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{fuck you elias.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{you get your men ready elias ...}
<A>__{concluding the debate, no further argument, barnes rises. the meeting's closed. lt. wolfe hasn't said a word, looking as elias departs, without a word.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<P>__{(watching him)}
<D>__{fucking guy's got 3 years in and he thinks he's cochise or something ...}
<A>__{his resentment directed partly at the way in which elias carries himself, the natural sense of grace and the dignity it bestows.}
