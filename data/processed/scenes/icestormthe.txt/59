<L>__{interior mike's room. night}
<A>__{mikey is painfully at work writing an english essay. sandy comes to the door with a geometry textbook.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{mikey?}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{geometry?}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{sure, anything but this english.}
<A>__{sandy puts the open textbook in front of him.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{why are you so good at math but not in english?}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{i'm not good at math. just geometry.}
<A>__{he looks at the book.}
<C>__{mikey }
<P>__{(drawing out his examples on a piece of paper)}
<D>__{it's like, you know when they say "two squared"? and you think it means 2 times 2, equals 4? but really they really mean a square. a square with a side of two. and the area of the square is four. like every time you use the word, like squared, or cubed, it's really space, it's not numbers, it's space. and it's perfect space, but only in your head, because you can't draw a perfect square, like in the material world, but in your mind, you can have perfect space.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you know?}
<A>__{as mikey goes on, we see his geometric doodles, and hear faintly the humming sound under his voice.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{yeah. but i just need some help with my homework.}
<A>__{a knock at the door. jim stands in the doorway with a suitcase in his hand.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{hey guys, i'm back.}
<C>__{mikey}
<P>__{(honestly confused)}
<D>__{you were gone?}
<A>__{sandy looks at mikey as if pondering a lost cause.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(a look of disappointment)}
<D>__{yeah mikey. yep, i was in houston, working on some great new ideas about silicon, which comes from sand, very conductive. how you guys doing? how's school?}
<A>__{mikey's still flustered.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{uh, i dunno. ok i guess.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{hmm. alright!}
<A>__{he walks off.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{you really didn't notice? man, he's been gone for three days.}
