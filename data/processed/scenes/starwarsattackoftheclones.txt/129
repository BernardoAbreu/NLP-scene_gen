<L>__{interior geonosis, execution arena day}
<A>__{the great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling geonosians. the cart trundles to the center, where obi wan is chained to one of four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter. the cart stops. padme and anakin are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them. padme is in the center.}
<D>__{obi wan i was beginning to wonder if you had gotten my message.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i retransmitted it as you requested, master. then we decided to come and rescue you. obi wan it looks like you're going a good job so far.}
<A>__{their arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives away. there is another roar as poggle the lesser, count dooku, nute gunray, the fetts and dignitaries arrive in the archducal box and take their places.}
<C>__{sun rit}
<D>__{the felons before you have been convicted of espionage against the sovereign system of geonosis. their sentence of death is to be carried out in this public arena henceforth.}
<A>__{the crowd roars and cheers. in the box, poggle the lesser rises. the crowd becomes quiet.}
<C>__{poggle}
<D>__{let the executions begin!}
<A>__{the crowd goes wild.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i have a bad feeling about this.}
<A>__{from different gates around the arena, three monsters are driven in. one is a reek (bull like), one is a nexu (lion like), and one is an acklay (a kind of dino lobster). they are driven in by picadors carrying long spears and riding orrays. the picadors poke the monsters toward the center, then retire to the perimeter. the monsters toss their heads, looking around, roaring or screeching. then they catch sight of the three captives and start moving toward them.}
<D>__{obi wan take the one the left. i will take the one on the right.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{what about padme?}
<A>__{padme has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.}
<D>__{obi wan it looks like she's already on top of things.}
<A>__{the reek charges anakin. he jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. anakin lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. the reek backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post obi wan ducks around the post as the acklay charges. it knocks the post flat, sending obi wan sprawling. the acklay crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. obi wan leaps up and runs towards one of the picadors. the acklay taks off after him. the nexu arrives at padme's post and rears on its hind legs. one top, padme struggles to tear the chain free. the nexu roars, displaying wicked, dripping fangs. in the archducal box, nute gunray beams and rubs his hands. in the arena, obi wan runs at the picador. the orray rears up. obi wan grabs the picador's long spear and pole vaults over him. the chasing acklay smashes into the orray. it goes down. the picador tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the acklay and crunched. anakin's reek starts to buck. it charges around the arena with anakin hanging on for dear life. he whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the reek's mouth. its jaws clamp hard on the chain. anakin yanks hard on the chain, turning the reek, beginning to ride it. the nexu's claws dig deep into the post. the cat like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at padme. she turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. she hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. then, padme jumps off the post into the air. she swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. it tumbles back onto the sand. in the archducal box:}
<C>__{nute gunray}
<D>__{foul!! she can't do that... shoot her or something!}
<A>__{in the arena, obi wan runs out from behind the fallen orray and throws the spear at the acklay, hitting it in the neck. it lets out a terrible screech and turns on him. the nexu springs up and makes to leap up at padme again. she finally manages to work the chain loose. anakin comes charging up on the reek.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{padme}
<P>__{(nods, gasping)}
<D>__{sure! well, sort of.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{jump!!!}
<A>__{the nexu springs. padme leaps from the top of the post to land on the reek in front of anakin. he hauls her upright. the reek charges away, around the arena. the nexu bounds after it. the reek passes the wounded acklay. the nexu smells the blood and turns aside to attack the acklay. the two monsters fight. the crowd groans and boos. in the archducal box, nute gunray turns angrily to count dooku.}
<C>__{nute gunray}
<D>__{this isn't how it's supposed to be! jango, finish her off.}
<A>__{count dooku motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. boba fett is enjoying the spectacle.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<P>__{(smiling enigmatically)}
<D>__{patiece, viceroy... she will die. maybe this is the way it's supposed to end.}
<A>__{obi wan runs and jumps on the back of the reek behind anakin. across the arena, the nexu, having chewed up the acklay, starts to advance toward them.}
