<L>__{exterior fbi building evening}
<A>__{the building is emptying out. in the lobby, ross passes a floor cleaner and a lone security guard.}

<L>__{exterior ross's apartment evening}
<A>__{ross enters his building.}
<L>__{interior ross's apartment evening}
<A>__{ross enters, turns on the lights, revealing an apartment as austere as cat's. heads for the small kitchen, where he is about to put his precooked meal in the microwave. when he feels a gun in the back of his neck.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{this won't take long. hands up.}
<A>__{ross raises his hands. cat reaches around, removes his gun.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{turn around.}
<A>__{ross faces her.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{sit.}
<A>__{she motions him into the chair behind him.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{just so you know, all this? being so smart? covering all your bases? it's not going to matter. it's already over. the whole place is wired with web cams.}
<A>__{his moment of triumph is short lived. cat reaches on the side of the counter. holds up six web cams, wires ripped out.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{you mean these?}
<A>__{tosses the ripped out cams onto the table.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{talking about covering all your bases. your chair is pressure wired. you move your ass one inch you don't have one anymore.}
<A>__{ross looks under the chair. sure enough, there are several wires leading out of the bottom of the chair. he looks further to the where the wires attach to a small charge. she puts her gun down on the table.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i know what you're thinking. maybe yes a bluff, maybe no. but you have to figure yes, given what you know about me.}
<A>__{ross does not move.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{this wasn't what i had in mind for myself when i was a kid. i wanted to be on the other side of things. like you.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{so what happened?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{he did.}
<A>__{she takes out an old picture of don luis, lifted from the internet. she takes out the picture of her parents and her as an eight year old.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{this is the last time i was happy.}
<C>__{cat }
<D>__{the next day they were dead. he killed them.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{and all this? all these clues...they weren't for us. they were for him.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i didn't know how else to find him.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{and you figured sooner or later we would make this public.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{it took you a long time.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{you're very patient.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{what else do i have to be? i have no one. i did. until this morning. i had them.}
<A>__{she takes out pictures of dead mama, dead emilio, dead pepe.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{you sent him a message. he sent you one back.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{and now i want to finish it.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{i can't help you.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{yes you can. he's protected by your government.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{by a part of the government i have no way of reaching. it's cia. i don't know why. but there's no getting through it, under it, around it, believe me, i've tried.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{you're going to have to try harder.}
<A>__{she takes a photo album out, opens it.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i found this on your table inside. your family, right?}
<A>__{begins to flip pages.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews. mother, father. nice.}
<A>__{ross knows what is coming.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i know this sounds harsh. but until i get what i want, you'll go to a funeral a week. and you will begin to feel what i have felt all these years.}
<A>__{she places the photo album in his lap. puts his food in the microwave, starts it. goes to exit.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{wait...}
<A>__{she stops.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{what about...?}
<A>__{he points to the chair.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{when your dinner's ready, the timer on it will have expired. then you can get to work.}
<A>__{and she is gone. ross watches the timer on the microwave. when it beeps, he sits a moment longer. hesitates to get up. little by little, he moves himself off the chair, tentative. afraid that any moment, boom! until he makes the final move, stands just enough to clear the seat, waiting for the worst to happen. and when it doesn't, he breathes a sigh of relief.}
