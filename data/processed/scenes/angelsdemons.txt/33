<L>__{int swiss guard offices corridor day}
<A>__{the interior of the swiss guard offices is ornate and filled with artwork, like every other vatican building. as they walk, langdon studies the row of statues of male nudes that lines both sides of the hallway, all wearing fig leaves.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{the great castration.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{1857. pius ix felt the male form might inspire lust, so he got a hammer and chisel and unmanned two hundred statues. these plaster fig leaves were added later.}
<A>__{olivetti stops abruptly, outside a heavy steel door with a security keyguard beside it.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{are you anti catholic, professor langdon?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{me? no, i'm anti vandalism.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{i urge you to guard your tone in there. the swiss guard is a calling, not a profession, and it encourages a certain zealotry. commander rocher, the head of the guard, is a deeply spiritual man, and he was close to the late pope. understood?}
<C>__{langdon}
<P>__{(sincere)}
<D>__{i just hope i can help.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{so do i. you were my idea.}
<A>__{he enters a five digit number on the keypad and the steel doors slide open.}
