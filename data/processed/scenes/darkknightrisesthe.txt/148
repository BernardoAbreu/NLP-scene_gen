<L>__{interior stone cell, underground prison day}
<A>__{wayne lies, weak, feverish. a prisoner drips water onto his parched lips. an elderly blind prisoner squatting by the wall in the next cell rasps something in an ancient tongue.}
<C>__{prisoner}
<D>__{he asks if you would pay us to let you die. i told him you have nothing.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{do it for the pleasure.}
<A>__{the prisoner puts bread to wayne's lips.}
<C>__{prisoner}
<D>__{they pay me more than that to keep you alive.}
<A>__{a chant gets wayne's attention. he rolls his head painfully to watch a tattooed prisoner hand a thick rope to a strong man, who ties it around his chest, watched by other prisoners.}
<C>__{prisoner}
<D>__{he will try the climb.}
<A>__{strong man starts scaling the wall. the prisoners' chant grows stronger as he climbs towards the light. above: strong man stops, perched on a ledge, a twelve foot leap from the rest of the climb... the chanting peaks as strong man leaps...misses...falls. the rope catches he swings into the rock face. prisoners fall silent as strong man is lowered, broken, bloody, to the prison floor.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{has anyone made it?}
<C>__{prisoner}
<D>__{of course not.}
<A>__{the blind prisoner barks at him.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{what does he say?}
<C>__{prisoner}
<D>__{he says there is one who did. a child...}
<A>__{insert cut: a child of about ten looks up towards the light.}
<C>__{prisoner}
<D>__{a child who had been born in this hell...}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{bane.}
<C>__{prisoner}
<D>__{an old legend. nothing more.}
<A>__{the prisoner leaves wayne's cell switches on the tv.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{don't.}
<C>__{prisoner}
<D>__{whatever they want you to see...it's happening soon.}
