<L>__{exterior high school parking lot later that day}
<A>__{commencement is over the parking lot is a sea of cars slowly negotiating through the mob of celebrating graduates, beaming parents, and rambunctious siblings. as helen slips through the crowd she is pleasantly ambushed by three (second grade) students of hers. she has a brief exchange with the children and then moves on. helen finds herself face to face with lloyd abbott as they both attempt to pass through a narrow space between two parked vehicles. they are both caught off guard there is no graceful way for them to squeeze past each other.}

<A>__{they pass each other and head their separate ways. their chance meeting has not gone unobserved: joan abbott has been watching them from the front seat of lloyd's brand new 1959 cadillac. she pretends to repair her lipstick with her compact mirror as lloyd slips behind the wheel. and helen finds jacey frowning at her. he opens the door so that she can get into the plymouth (doug is already in the back seat). jacey glares at lloyd as he walks around the car and gets in behind the wheel. lloyd flips down his sun visor (to block jacey's glare) and pulls out of his parking spot.}
