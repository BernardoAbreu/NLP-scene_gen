<A>__{sam's finger as it presses two buttons on his jukebox. we watch as the mechanical arm selects a record and slowly, sensuously, lowers it to the turntable. the arm hovers over the record and then descends. it begins to play. the song is "unchained melody" by the righteous brothers.}
<B>__{sam and molly}
<A>__{are dancing in the middle of the dark loft. moonlight pours through the windows and shines off the floor. wads of packing paper swirl sensuously around their feet. molly runs her fingers down sam's naked back. the moment is sweet and erotic. we watch as sam slowly draws his fingers down over molly's face, gently caressing her forehead, her eyes, her lips. sam slides his hands under molly's t shirt, slowly moving them toward her breasts. her breathing slows. they dance silently, her hair swaying in the soft light. we hear the sounds of their bare feet on the highly polished floor. sensuously, molly's shirt lifts above her navel as sam presses into her. their stomachs touch and part and touch again. she bites her lip. sam eyes her moonlit form as she strokes his chest, slowly moving her fingers down his torso, around the curve of his hips, and then digging into the back of his jeans. sam leans into molly and nips at her neck. she stops dancing. her eyes close. she stands absolutely still. sam's hands move to her backside. he pulls her closer.}
