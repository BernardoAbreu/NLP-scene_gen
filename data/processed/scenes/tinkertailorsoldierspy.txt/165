<A>__{belinda, the deb we met earlier, is doing up her blouse. she's teary and also a little excited that men are fighting over her.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{stop it! stop it!}
<A>__{kaspar has guillam pinned against the wall and is punching him. guillam accepts the blows with a bloody grin. something of the school yard fight about it, as the other scalphunters gather around, ostensibly to break it, up but clearly enjoying the distraction. one of them is trying to pull kaspar off and, caught by a blow, joins in the fight escalating as others join in the struggle.}
<C>__{kaspar}
<D>__{keep your bloody hands off her!}
<A>__{he kicks at guillam, who falls. belinda gives a shriek of alarm.}
<C>__{scalphunter}
<D>__{christ's sake, don't fight over a bit of skirt!}
<A>__{guillam lies on the floor taking another kick, but his face, turned to us, registers only relief. job done.}
