<L>__{interior conference room day}
<A>__{a dozen high powered executives from all over the globe sit around a massive board room table. the head seat at the table is unoccupied. they mumble back and forth to each other, unsure why they're there. mark bursts into the room in a suit, looking very manicured.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{gentleman, thank you all for coming here on such short notice. i have some very big news for you all today. executive #1 is it from the man in the sky?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{nope, this one i came up with all on my own. and it's going to change the way you all do business... forever.}
<A>__{mark hits a button and a projection screen comes down on the far wall. mark starts a slide show.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{up until now, all products sold worldwide have warning labels printed on them. warnings like these.}
<A>__{series of slides: we see the same warning we just saw on the coke can, a commercial jet with "this plane might crash four of our other ones did" printed on its side, a car dashboard light reading "this car will ignite upon impact always", and a sticker on a grocery store package of ground meat that reads "injected with hormones that make it taste better but will eventually give you cancer".}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{as you can see, a lot of these products can be very depressing. they remind people of all the horrible things that can happen to them in life. people hate thinking about horrible things. executive #2 yeah, but they have to know those things.}
<P>__{executive #2 (cont'd)}
<D>__{they have to be able to protect themselves. i don't want to hurt anyone. especially now that i know about the "bad place".}
<A>__{everyone in the room shudders.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{hear me out, fellas. allow me to introduce you to the future of your companies.}
<A>__{mark changes the slide to a can of coke that simple reads, "coke tastes great! and it's good for you!" everyone in the room "ahhhs".}
<D>__{executive #3 where can i get some of that healthy coke?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it's the same coke as before.}
<A>__{the executives all squint their eyes.}
<D>__{executive #4 but this one is healthy! and it tastes great! executive #1 do you have any samples?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{guys, it's the same coke on the inside. i've just changed the outside. executive #1}
<P>__{(revelation)}
<D>__{somehow by changing the outside, he's also changed the inside!}
<A>__{everyone "aaahs" in understanding. mark sighs and changes the slide to that of a commercial airliner with the words "completely safe" writing on the outside.}
<D>__{executive #2 oh, thank goodness. i've always hated flying! executive #3 me too! executive #4 what an invention! how did you do it?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i didn't do anything, guys. i made this on my computer last night. the plane is exactly the same as it was before.}
<A>__{nobody in the room gets it.}
<D>__{executive #1 that's the only plane i will ever fly on again!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that's the point here guys. with these new advertising strategies, people will buy your products with abandon. executive #2 but it will take years to replace all of our stock with these new improved products you've invented.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no. it won't. all you have to do is print these words on the packaging. that's it.}
<A>__{mark changes the slide again: the car dashboard light now reads, "this car prevents crashes", and another slide that shows a package of meat with a sticker reading, "this meat actually cures cancer".}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{even if you don't understand it, just start shipping these products out to people as you see them here and you're all going to get very, very rich. executive #3 how did you do it?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{look, they're still the same products you have on the shelves right now. the only difference now is that people won't get bummed out or scared when they use them. isn't that a good thing?}
<A>__{the executives all nod their heads in agreement and rise to shake mark's hand.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{gentleman, if you'll excuse me, i have five thousand gay orphans on my front lawn that are going bananas.}
<A>__{mark exits.}
