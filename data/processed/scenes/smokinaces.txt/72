<A>__{a cellphone being lifted, revealing special agent carruthers.}
<C>__{carruthers}
<D>__{yes sir. go ahead.}
<P>__{(listens, checks watch)}
<D>__{we're three miles from the nomad now. we'll be awaiting word.}
<A>__{he clicks off. messner occupies the passenger seat, reviewing surveillance tape, portable headphones on, mini dat player in his lap. he listens to the following excerpt:}
<C>__{serna }
<D>__{ so, i'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to israel before the swede can }
<A>__{messner pulls the headphones off.}
<C>__{messner}
<D>__{anything on the swede?}
<C>__{carruthers}
<D>__{only the mention made in that phone call. there's no swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.}
<C>__{messner}
<D>__{maybe he's that good. never been caught, no criminal record.}
<C>__{carruthers}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{messner, sets the gear on the floorboard, stretches. he turns over photographs of victor padiche and sidney serna. (the same ones that were tacked to the corkboard of the surveillance van in the opening)}
<C>__{messner }

<C>__{messner}
<P>__{(re; the passing neon)}
<D>__{well... this is as good a place for it as any i guess.}
