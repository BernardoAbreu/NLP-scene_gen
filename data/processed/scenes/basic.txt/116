<L>__{interior coffee room present evening}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you kept kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. you even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{can't do that now, though, can you?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{you walked into the army a convicted felon with a sentence of five years in a uniform and were going walk out eight weeks later with a different name, a clean record, and an honorable discharge a guy who did "everything he could" to save his friends.}
<A>__{dunbar looks at them. one to the other. slowly.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{is that what i did, now? and of course, you can prove all of it.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{we can prove that you're not ray dunbar. impersonating a fellow cadet is a court martial in and of itself }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{did i ever claim i was raymond dunbar? was i ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? no. you assumed who i was, because i was wearing this uniform. don't believe me?}
<A>__{he reaches under the table and rips out the hidden microphone.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{check your tapes.}
<A>__{hardy and osborne exchange an uneasy glance.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{we don't need the tapes }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{oh, you don't? what else do you have on me? you haven't found any bodies yet, have you?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{we've found all of them.}
<A>__{dunbar chuckles at the bluff.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{ohhhh, i don't think so...}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{just a guess. maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. maybe somebody moved them. habeas corpus no bodies, no crime, and nunez still plays as self defense. face it detectives ... you have nothing.}
<A>__{hardy, knowing he's right. in a flash he reaches down pulls osborne's gun and grabs dunbar, slamming him up against the wall, pressing the weapon to his temple!}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{not true, cadet, i've got a gun }
<C>__{dunbar}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{jesus!}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{hardy, what are you doing }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{isn't this how your story goes? pike annoys someone so much he gets shot in the head }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{please, please don't }
<A>__{a pounding on the locked door. hardy ignores it.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{we can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you }
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{hardy, for chrissakes }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{where's west's body?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<P>__{(practically in tears)}
<D>__{you'll never find it }
<A>__{hardy cocks the pistol as dunbar screams:}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{you'll never find it cause he's not dead!}
<A>__{a crash as the door's lock snaps and m.p.'s pour into the room! styles and the jag lawyer behind, taking in the scene.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{what in god's name is going on?}
<A>__{hardy releases dunbar, who slides to the floor, gasping.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{he he made me do it }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{do what?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{hunting we had to hunt him }
<C>__{jag lawyer}
<D>__{sergeant, arrest these men!}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you mean the exercise?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{there never was an exercise! never targets, never teams, i don't even know if there's a creek bed out there }
<A>__{as the m.p.'s grab hardy and osborne, pulling them away...}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{jag lawyer}
<D>__{that's enough }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{goddammit, what did you do?!}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i couldn't kill him!}
<A>__{he breaks down sobbing. styles holds up a hand to the m.p.'s.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{hang on.}
<C>__{jag lawyer}
<D>__{colonel }
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{no. i want to hear this.}
<A>__{the jag lawyer glowers as the m.p.'s stand down. dunbar tries to pull himself together. to hardy:}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{you're right. i was the one he singled out. beat me morning, noon, and night, ran me ragged. when mueller found me, i was gone. he gave me a little taste...}
