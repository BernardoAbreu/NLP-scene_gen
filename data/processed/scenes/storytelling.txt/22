<L>__{interior dining room evening}
<A>__{the livingstons are eating dinner.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{so? how was school today?}
<C>__{scooby}
<D>__{the same.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{the same. same as what?}
<C>__{scooby}
<D>__{just the same.}
<A>__{a tense pause.}
<C>__{brady}
<D>__{we're studying the holocaust in social studies.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{oh, yeah?}
<C>__{scooby}
<D>__{we did the same thing last year also.}
<C>__{fern}
<D>__{how was the class?}
<C>__{brady}
<D>__{well, i'm supposed to watch schindler's list for homework. the movie's like almost four hours. and then i'm supposed to write a report on survivors.}
<P>__{(to marty)}
<D>__{you know any survivors, dad?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{hmmm...do i know any...personally...?}
<C>__{fern}
<D>__{well, technically your zeda is a survivor.}
<C>__{brady}
<D>__{he was in a concentration camp?}
<C>__{fern}
<D>__{well, no. but he had to escape the nazis.}
<C>__{brady}
<D>__{but i thought he came over to america before the war.}
<C>__{fern}
<D>__{well, he did. with his family. but his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. and if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. so in my book he's a survivor.}
<C>__{brady}
<D>__{even though it was only his cousins that were killed?}
<C>__{fern}
<D>__{but that could've happened to him. or to me, if i'd been alive. or you.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{or me?}
<C>__{scooby}
<D>__{you mean, then, we're all survivors?}
<C>__{fern}
<D>__{well...yes. if it hadn't been for hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave europe. we would have been...european.}
<C>__{scooby}
<D>__{but then, in a sense, since you would never have met dad if your family had stayed in europe...if it weren't for hitler, none of us would have been born.}
<A>__{a long pause.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{get the hell outta here!}
<C>__{scooby}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{man, it's just, like, conversation.}
