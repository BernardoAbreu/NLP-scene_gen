<L>__{interior apartment n night}
<A>__{in the middle of the large darkened kitchen, mr. brooks pauses to listen to the sounds of the apartment. the gun with the silencer is already in his right hand. both are encased in a ziplock bag. beside him, mr. smith is wide eyed with fear and anticipation. his teeth are even chattering.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{try a couple deep breaths through your nose.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{i have to take a crap so bad.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{this won't take long.}
<A>__{mr. brooks and mr. smith come out of the kitchen. the living room is quite well appointed. there's a fire going in the fireplace. the sound of a t.v. is coming from a room off a hall up ahead. that is where mr. brooks and mr. smith are headed. they're more than half way across the living room when ding! dong!, the doorbell rings. mr. smith gasps and looks beseechingly at mr. brooks. without an ounce of hurry, mr. brooks maneuvers him back into the shadows of the kitchen. the doorbell rings again. a wet spot appears in mr. smith's crotch and runs down his pant leg. pee drips onto the linoleum. a man comes out of the hallway. the living room light goes on. the man is jesse, detective atwood's estranged husband. he opens the front door. the woman who comes in is sheila, his divorce lawyer. they kiss, tongues. his hands brush over her breasts. he begins to unbutton her blouse. the kiss breaks. as he continues unbuttoning.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{i called your wife's lawyer. they're thinking about the five million dollars.}
<A>__{jesse opens the blouse and looks at the breasts under the bra.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{realistically how much do you think we can get?}
<A>__{sheila gives him a quick kiss and moves on into the living room where she drops her briefcase on the couch.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{if we go to court, best case, two, if she wants to settle, best case, three, but i would be happy with two seven.}
<A>__{backlit by the fireplace, jesse kisses her again. from the kitchen, mr. brooks and mr. smith watch jesse unzip sheila's slacks and dropping to his knees peel them off her legs. she steps out of them. he kisses the inside of her thighs, her crotch, then standing up:}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i will be right back.}
<A>__{on his way out of the living room:}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i think we should hold firm for three.}
<A>__{he shuts off the light. in the glow of the fireplace, sheila removes her jacket.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{let's not be piggish, two five, two seven, would be a good deal.}
<A>__{the t.v. goes silent. jesse returns with a partially full glass of champagne. he hands sheila a glass from a side table, takes a bottle out of an ice bucket and as he fills her glass:}
<C>__{sheila}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{you've already had half a bottle.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{you're late; if we want it, there's more.}
<A>__{they clink glasses.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{to us.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{to three million dollars.}
<C>__{sheila}
<P>__{(after a sip)}
<D>__{we have to do this fast because remember, marie is meeting us here.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{we could ask her to join us.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{not funny.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(undoing the front of her bra)}
<D>__{i wasn't trying to be.}
<A>__{she bops him playfully. he bends and slips a nipple into his mouth. sheila bites her lip and moans. in the kitchen, mr. smith shifts around for a better view. the floor under him crreeekks! in the living room, both sheila and jesse react to the sound.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{are we alone?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{mr. brooks seems to appear magically out of the darkened kitchen with his gun raised. he's followed by mr. smith. sheila opens her mouth to scream.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{don't do that.}
