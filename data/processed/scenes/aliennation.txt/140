<L>__{interior conference room night}
<A>__{the large suitcase rests on the expansive conference table. a manicured alien hand reaches in and slowly opens it. inside are fifty one kilo glass tubes full of the viscous blue drug. also several of the small, individual dispensers. it is harcourt, standing behind the table in a pool of light, who has opened the suitcase. he is flanked by kipling... with quint elsewhere in the room. the room is lit by track light, creating pools of light and dark. the two alien dealers' eyes widen at the sight of the drug. the human dealer doesn't know what it is.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<P>__{(to alien dealers)}
<D>__{it's been a long time, hasn't it, gentlemen?}
<C>__{human dealer}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{a sweet indulgence from out past... resurrected for our future.}
<A>__{harcourt sees the hungering expressions on the alien dealers' faces... smiles knowingly. he slides one of the dispensers from the suitcase.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<P>__{(continuing; to alien dealers)}
<D>__{please feel free to sample the quality. the experience will be everything you remember it to be...}
<A>__{one of the alien dealers takes the dispenser, brings it to his tongue. the other alien dealer turns to harcourt }
<C>__{alien dealer}
<D>__{where'd you get it?}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{i arranged to spend some time with three very resourceful men. with a certain amount of coaxing, one of them was able to reconstitute the formula for me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they worked very well together. unfortunately, they are no longer with us... but i was fortunate enough to reap the benefit of their endeavor.}
<A>__{he indicates the drug. the first alien dealer sways gently, enjoying the sensation. the second alien dealer takes his hit... shudders as the first rush washes over him. the human dealer is no fool... he grabs the dispenser.}
<C>__{human dealer}
<D>__{let me try some.}
<P>__{(he does,}
<D>__{immediately spits}
<P>__{it out)}
<D>__{jesus! tastes like detergent!}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{and that's all the effect it will have on you. but when my fellow newcomers learn they can obtain it here, they will work very hard... to make as much money as they can... to give it to me.}
<A>__{suddenly, a voice from the shadows near the open door to the other office:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{you haven't told him all of it.}
<A>__{harcourt and the others react. quint leaps to his feet, caught off guard. kipling reaches for his shoulder holster. a silhouette beside the open door to the outer office nudges cassandra into the light of the room, then steps out himself. it is jetson. quint gets his gun out, is about to aim... when his eyes go wide at the sight of something jetson holds. it is the plastic explosive charge that quint was wiring to the slug mobile. the wires are connected and jetson's finger squeezes down hard on the detonation push switch.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{he's got the c 4 charge!}
<A>__{jetson moves forward slowly, holding the bomb in front of him. he is sweating rivers. the others quickly join him. he nudges cassandra ahead of himself, keeping her where he can see her.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{just take it real casual, buddy. keep your finger on that button and don't do nothing squirrely.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{if you release that button, you not only kill us, but yourself.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{to get you and that }
<P>__{(indicates drug in suitcase)}
<D>__{ i would do it.}
<A>__{he says it with such straightforward eye contact, that harcourt (and we) know he isn't bluffing.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{everyone up against that wall. very slowly.}
<P>__{(to harcourt)}
<D>__{except you.}
<A>__{harcourt remains behind the desk. cassandra stays where she is, near jetson. the others move to the wall. kipling in particular is going nuts, letting this happen. jetson takes the "sample" dispenser from the table, tosses it into the suitcase, then closes the lid and locks it. all the while keeping his eye on harcourt and the others.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{one small matter seems to have escaped your attention. that }
<P>__{(indicates suitcase)}
<D>__{ is not on any books as a controlled substance. legally it might as well be fifty kilos of... grape jelly.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{the charge is murder... and conspiracy to commit murder. hubley, porter, strader... probably others.}
<A>__{there's a flicker of concern behind harcourt's icy blue eyes. cassandra stares at harcourt.}
<C>__{cassandra}
<D>__{you... you killed strader?}
<A>__{cassandra runs to harcourt grabbing his jacket.}
<C>__{cassandra}
<D>__{where's todd?! did you do something to todd?!}
<A>__{harcourt looks down at her, totally uninvolved.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{todd? who is todd.}
<P>__{(then remembers; smiles)}
<D>__{ah, poor mr. watson.}
<A>__{cassandra's eyes go wide as the horror of what he said sinks in. jetson nudges harcourt with the suitcase. they start out. cassandra, wild with rage, grabs quint's .357 and with a keening wail, brings it up toward harcourt's face.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{nooo!}
<A>__{jetson drops the suitcase as he lunges for the gun. he manages to knock it away just as she fires the bullet going into the wall behind harcourt. striking like a mongoose, kipling leaps forward, grabbing the two lead wires on the bomb in jetson's hand and jerking them apart. jetson reacts an instant late... releasing the switch... and nothing happens.}
<C>__{kipling}
<D>__{i got it!}
<A>__{kipling tackles jetson and they both go crashing to the floor. quint grabs the gun from cassandra and hammers her with it, hard. she drops to her knees and quint viciously hits her again. meanwhile, jetson struggles to regain his feet. kipling rears back and delivers a crushing blow under jetson's arm to the nerve plexus. jetson instantly folds over forward and kipling savagely brings up his knee into jetson's face, flipping him back. kipling slams him into the wall face first, pinning him there.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{kill them both.}
<C>__{kipling}
<D>__{here?}
<C>__{harcourt}
<P>__{(raging)}
<D>__{do it!}
<A>__{quint brings the gun up, places the muzzle against the base of cassandra's skull, starts to squeeze the trigger. there's a loud blam! and cassandra flinches... then looks up. quint is blown backward away from her. sykes stand in the doorway from the private office, the casull smoking in his hand. quint hits the wall behind him only it's not a solid wall, but the huge window overlooking the club. he crashes through it.}
<B>__{angle from dance floor}
<A>__{as the wall of mirror explodes in slow motion and quint cartwheels to the floor in a shower of diamonds. angle in the office kipling shoves jetson aside, draws his gun and fires at sykes. sykes dodges into the private office for cover. the three dealers dive behind any available furniture. harcourt snatches up the suitcase and rushes to the door leading into the adjoining outer office. sykes swings around the edge of the private office door, straight arms the casull into the office and fires. kipling fires back, crossing toward the outer office door, covering harcourt's back. sykes ducks back down. an unsteady jetson rises from the floor, sees harcourt and kipling escaping, and takes off after them. sykes straight arms the gun into the room again... sees jetson disappearing through the adjoining office door. he moves into the room as the three drug dealers, arms up in surrender, rise from behind the furniture.}
<C>__{alien dealer}
<D>__{don't shoot, man we're unarmed look!}
<A>__{sykes looks at these harmless wimps... then at cassandra.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{cassandra}
<P>__{(dazed, but all right)}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{and he charges out the adjoining office door.}
