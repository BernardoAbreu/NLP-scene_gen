<L>__{interior a back apartment same time}
<A>__{a syringe is plunged into larry's arm. sam is tending to larry's wound. sam seems to know what he's doing, as larry is also hooked up to a bottle of plasma hanging on a make shift stand.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(answering larry's question)}
<D>__{it's a cocktail. mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{fine with fucking me, we got work to do. i don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do. i don't know about the rest of you guys, but i'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.}
<P>__{(a quick beat)}
<D>__{i don't mean that in, like, a literal way...}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{finding this package is a thing easier said than done. we don't even know what it is.}
<P>__{(he looks at deirdre, and suddenly he's deadly earnest)}
<D>__{what did we steal?}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(suddenly defensive)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{when this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show. and i don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{well i don't!}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{and i don't believe you...}
<A>__{vincent's gun is out in the blink of an eye, at deirdre's head, but she's as fast as he is and her gun is drawn as well, jammed into his stomach.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(suddenly feral)}
<D>__{you go shoot me if you want, vincent, but you'll be dead before i hit the ground.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(matching her intensity)}
<D>__{i don't want you dead, woman, i want the the truth!}
<C>__{sam }
<P>__{(with a dead cool in his voice)}
<D>__{both of you...}
<A>__{another angle sam has the two of them covered with his gun an interesting moment, because he can shoot either deirdre or vincent, but not both at the same time. the question is: whose side is he on?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(continuing without missing a beat)}
<D>__{...put your guns down and chill out.}
<A>__{a beat. and then vincent and deirdre lower their weapons, followed by sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{like it or now, we're on the same side: we're here and the package isn't.}
<P>__{(looks at deirdre)}
<D>__{you're not the boss any more, you're our partner. so tell us what you know, so we can figure a way out of this mess.}
<A>__{sam's look isn't romantic, but it implies a level of trust based upon their physical intimacy.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{now, what did we steal?}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(she hates to admit this)}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<P>__{(defensively, off vincent's look)}
<D>__{well i don't! it's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.}
<P>__{(quick beat, then reluctantly continuing)}
<D>__{but i do know who we're working for. my people, and the russian mob.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{your people? who the fuck is your people?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{who do you think, larry? the ira.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{and you believed me?}
<P>__{(passionately)}
<D>__{but it wasn't my people who did it.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{how do we know that?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{exactly. gregor, he was the russian's man. it was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the russians who had the capital to finance it. gregor, he was their insurance, and i was ours. everybody else was supposed to be neutral. gregor must've got to swede...}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i never did trust that blonde fuck...}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{that's why you were riding with him.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{the question still remains: what do we do now?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(he figures something out)}
<D>__{gregor's cell phone...}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{what are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(ignoring larry, to deirdre)}
<D>__{did he bring that with him?}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{i bought it for him all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract. cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: gregor had expensive tastes.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{check this out.}
<P>__{(he's thinking on his feet)}
<D>__{gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently. when he was a spy he lived the life you know, a prince in some eastern bloc country where nobody had shit and gregor had everything. then the wall goes down. no more cold war. and gregor is out of a job. no apartment, no special stores with western food and video tapes. i would bet dollars against shit that gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up. and i wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(finishing his sentence)}
<D>__{that we're too stupid to trace his calls.}
<A>__{deirdre and sam share the slightest of conspiratorial smiles as they realize they're both thinking the same thought: they might still win this one.}
