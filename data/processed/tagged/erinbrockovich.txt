<L>__{exterior southern california suburb, main drag day}
<A>__{palms sway ... the sun washes everything in yellow ... cars motor down either side of the landscaped median ... the calls of mockingbirds mingle with the blip blip of car alarms. on the sidewalk, a skateboard ca lunks down the sidewalk, past the foot traffic of southern californians: flip flops, doc marten's, rollerblades, nikes ... then, in the middle of this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of impossibly high spike heeled pumps struts out of a shop. so high it hurts to look at them. as the shoes leave frame, we tilt up and see they're leaving a 99 cent store. as the pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are connected to a pair of impossibly long, shapely legs. eveready legs they just keep going and going. they saunter past two businessmen on a lunch break. the men pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful woman. in fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes rest on her a microsecond longer than usual. two skateboarders note the stretchy micro mini skimming the tops of her thighs. a mailman spots the big, dark sunglasses tucked into a mountain of big, blond hair. a pre teen girl glimpses the plunging neckline of the tight, bright red midriff baring bustier. it isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is so goggle eyed. eye catching is an understatement. all those folks who say barbie's proportions are unrealistic have obviously never met erin brockovich.}
<L>__{exterior around the corner day}
<A>__{a side street. no pedestrians, just parked cars. a parking ticket flaps under the wiper of an old hyundai.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{fuck.}
<A>__{even when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to her voice. like kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze. as she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses accidentally clatter to the ground.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{when she picks them up, a fingernail snags on the pavement.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{goddamnit.}
<A>__{she tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in.}
<B>__{wider on the street}
<A>__{the hyundai starts it up, signals. then, just as it pulls slowly out into the street, a jaguar barrels around the corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side of erin's car, sending it careening into the median. it smashes into a foot thick lightpost. and stops.}
<L>__{exterior masry & vititoe day}
<A>__{a boring building on a boring block in the valley, surrounded by strip malls. definitely not where the power lawyers work.}
<C>__{rosalind }
<D>__{morning, mr. masry. how you doing today?}
<L>__{interior masry & vititoe, reception day}
<A>__{generic. cottage cheese ceilings, motel art. a sign over the reception desk reads: masry & vititoe, attorneys at law. ed masry, senior partner, slumps by rosalind, his chipper receptionist, with a cup of coffee in his hand. he's in his mid 50's, compact and even though it's only 9 am already rumpled.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{don't ask that on mondays, rosalind.}
<A>__{whatever passion he once had for the personal injury law that is his career has long since dissipated. he trundles off toward his office.}
<L>__{interior masry & vititoe, outside ed's office day}
<A>__{ed's secretary brenda 50's, jaded, hates her job, but what can you do? is on the phone when ed rounds the corner. she puts the call on hold, turns to ed.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{tony marvin.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{oh, jesus. who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{his dry cleaners. you want him?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what do you think? what's this?}
<A>__{he grabs a gift wrapped bottle off her desk, reads the card.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{tequila. from your drug dealer friend.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{he's a low life. speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.}
<A>__{ed peers into his office. it's a mess papers everywhere, unopened mail. standing in the middle of the room is erin, in a teensy, leopard print mini dress. as she jiggles a spike heeled foot, everything about her shimmies gloriously. except her head, which is held in place by a neck brace.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{whoa.}
<P>__{(to brenda)}
<D>__{remind me.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{erin brockovich. car accident. not her fault, she says.}

<C>__{ed}
<D>__{you shouldn't judge, brenda.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{right. lap dancers are people too.}
<A>__{as ed heads into his office, brenda picks up the phone.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{i can't find him, tony. we'll have to call you back.}
<L>__{interior masry & vititoe, ed's office day}
<A>__{not an office that exudes authority, and ed's blustery entrance only adds to the sense of chaos.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{erin hi. sorry you had to wait. here, sit down, sit down.}
<A>__{he clears a stack of papers off a chair.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{thanks a lot.}
<P>__{(as she sits)}
<D>__{i tell you, i never thought just standing would take it out of me, but ever since that shithead hit me, it feels like my whole body's put together wrong.}
<A>__{ed gives her a look of pro forma sympathy.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{jesus, you poor thing.}
<P>__{(he sits)}
<D>__{well, listen, you came to the right place. whoever did this to you made one hell of a mistake, and you and me, we're gonna make him pay for it.}
<A>__{he takes out a pad and paper, gets ready to write.}

<D>__{why don't you tell me what happened?}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior southern california courtroom day}
<A>__{erin is on the stand, wearing the most conservative thing she owns: a red, form fitting mini dress, telling her story to ed, who's questioning her.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{i was pulling out real slow, and out of nowhere, his jaguar comes racing around the corner like a bat outta hell ...}
<A>__{she glances at the defendant's table, where a doctor sits nobly in surgical scrubs. his wife and two beautiful kids are behind him. a frigging norman rockwell painting.}
<T>__{later in her testimony:}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{they took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck. i didn't have insurance, so i'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.}

<D>__{which one?}
<C>__{defending lawyer}
<P>__{(feigning shock)}
<D>__{there's more than one?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{yeah. there's two. why?}
<A>__{erin looks over at the jury. the personification of conservative family values. oh, shit.}
<T>__{later in her testimony:}
<C>__{erin}
<P>__{(getting defensive)}
<D>__{... not like a career, cause i had my babies. but i woulda worked, for sure, if i didn't have this neck thing.}
<A>__{erin sees a juror staring judgmentally at her short hem. erin gives it a tug, pulling it down a stitch.}
<C>__{defending lawyer}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{right. no doubt.}
<A>__{erin sees a few jurors share dubious glances. great.}
<T>__{still later:}
<A>__{the defendant's lawyers is on the offensive. erin's starting to feel the case slipping away.}

<P>__{(pointed)}
<D>__{what's your point?}
<A>__{ed shakes his head slightly to her don't get mad.}
<C>__{defending lawyer}
<D>__{broke, three kids, no job. a doctor in a jaguar must've looked like a pretty good meal ticket.}
<A>__{erin sees jurors nodding almost imperceptibly in agreement. she's on a sinking ship.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{what? hey hehitme.}
<C>__{defending lawyer}
<D>__{so you say.}
<C>__{erin}

<D>__{i told you the questions might get a little personal }
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{bullshit. you told me i'd get half a million dollars. you told me i'd be set.}

<L>__{exterior erin's house day}
<A>__{a shitty little house in a shitty part of northbridge. the hyundai with a bashed in side pulls up to the curb. erin gets out, takes the mail from her mailbox, then heads over to the equally grim house next door and rings the bell. a hispanic woman in her 60's opens the door, holding a white baby. this is mrs. morales.}
<C>__{mrs. morales}
<D>__{hi, erin! you're back so soon. how was it?}
<A>__{she hands erin the baby. it's beth, erin's 9 month old. erin avoids the question by focusing on her baby.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{hi, sweetie. were you a good girl? where are matt and katie?}
<C>__{mrs. morales}
<D>__{outside with the sprinkler. so it's good?}

<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{wow, that's soon }
<C>__{mrs. morales}
<D>__{i know. but it's good for me. now i can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. and it's good for you, too. now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? not the old lady next door.}
<A>__{oh, god. in erin's arms, beth starts to cough.}
<L>__{exterior erin's house day}
<A>__{erin carries beth up to her house. as she nears her door, she steps on a giant water bug. it crunches under her sole.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{ugh.}

<L>__{interior erin's house, main living dining space day}
<A>__{just as dull inside. salvation army furniture. a lot of beige. erin's two older kids, matthew (7) and katie (5) are at the table. beth is in a baby seat. erin spoons some mac & cheese onto their plates, trying to hide her worry.}
<C>__{matthew}
<D>__{i don't like this part, it's all crusty.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i like the crust.}

<C>__{katie}
<D>__{how come you're not eating?}
<A>__{cause there isn't enough food.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{mamma's gonna eat later.}
<A>__{from her baby seat on the table, beth coughs some more. thick, sick sounding coughs. erin looks at her.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{don't go getting sick on me, baby. okay?}
<L>__{interior erin's bathroom night}
<A>__{the shower and sink are both on full, filling the room with steam. erin is seated with coughing, crying beth on her lap, trying to steam the illness out of her.}

<L>__{interior drugstore, at the register day}
<A>__{as a customer steps away from the register, erin steps up with the bottle in her hand and smiles at the check out lady.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{hi, remember me? i was in yesterday. bought a whole mess of stuff? round about five? check out lady honey, it's a zoo here at five. i'm lucky if i even see a face, much less remember it.}
<C>__{erin}

<A>__{erin feeds beth her medicine, feeling miserable about it.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{just remember. no matter what your mamma does, lying and stealing is real bad. i don't ever wanna hear you doing something like that ...}
<A>__{on the table beside her sit the classifieds. row after row of want ads circled, then x 'd out in red. a water bug crawls across the edge of the paper.}
<C>__{erin}

<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{nothing you can't show up for with a stain.}
<A>__{as ed checks his reflection in the glass wall of his office, he notices, on the other side: erin, standing in the middle of the secretaries' area, in a miniskirt and leather bustier, talking to mario, the firm's mentally challenged office boy. mario heads away from her.}

<A>__{glances skitter between the secretaries get a load of this. ed lowers his voice.}

<D>__{i never lied. i may have miscalculated that happens sometimes, but }
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{you said things would be fine, and they're not.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i'm sorry about that. really. but }
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{i don't need pity. i need a paycheck. and i've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn. so i figure, since you're the one who said i was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.}
<A>__{ed sees everyone watching him, listening.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i'd love to help, erin, but i'm sorry, i have a full staff right now, so }
<A>__{he starts to escort her out, but she stays put.}

<A>__{erin steps out onto her front stoop and looks over at what used to be mrs. morales's house. a few motorcycles are parked on the lawn; a few bikers are drinking beer on the stoop; and one asshole is on his bike, revving his engine.}

<L>__{interior erin's hyundai day}
<A>__{erin looks around. the house she's passing has been razed. a heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property. as she checks the piece of paper with donna's address, she drives by the pg&e compressor station, a massive gray structure of pipes, chimneys and ladders, set way back from the road. erin passes it without noticing it. she stops at an intersection. the house on the corner has been boarded up with plywood. erin notices it depressing then turns the corner onto donna's street.}

<C>__{donna}
<D>__{thank you. i think so too. that's why i'm being such a stickler on this house price thing. i don't mean to be a pain in pg&e's backside, especially after all they've done for hinkley, but i look around here and i think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it. and i don't just mean pay for the house; i'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.}

<C>__{erin}
<D>__{yeah, i'm real glad you brought that up. i was going through your file here, and i ran into these medical records. they kinda surprised me }

<D>__{i will say. holy moley.}

<C>__{erin}
<D>__{yeah, i can see that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i guess the only thing that confused me is not that your medical problems aren't important, but how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?}
<A>__{donna tops off their iced teas.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{are you kidding? with how our lives are, if i start subdividing files, i will be sunk. i just kept all pg&e correspondence in one place.}

<C>__{erin}
<D>__{they did?}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{you bet. paid for a check up for the whole family. and not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either. they just took care of it. just like that. we never even saw a bill.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{wow. why would they do that?}
