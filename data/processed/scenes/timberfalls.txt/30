<A>__{stars fill the sky. crickets chirp, but aside from that, peace and quiet reign. a fire crackles. a tent for two has been pitched. dirty pots, pans litter the area. dinner's over and done. mike and sheryl cuddle by the fire. a sleeping bag wrapped around them.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{that was... the worst dinner ever.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you cooked.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah, i'm aware.}

<D>__{what's that mean?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{not sure. but i think it's the nastier of the two books.}
<A>__{sheryl pulls mike into her, they kiss. strong and deep. sheryl abruptly breaks the kiss, enough foreplay. she stands up, pulls mike into the tent with her.}
