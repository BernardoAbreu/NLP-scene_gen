<A>__{hyp gives the boys a wink and a thumbs up, then wanders off to shmooze his other guests. monkeybone shakes stu's hand.}

<D>__{fate worse than death! well, it's been real, boss, but i gotta go buff up my resume. anybody here need a figment?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{fine! don't put yourself out. i will go to the land of death alone.}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{stu, you have my absolute confidence. dead man! dead man walking!!}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(grabbing him by the throat)}
<D>__{i've got one chance to get back to julie, and i'm gonna take it with or without you.}
<A>__{he turns and stalks off. monkeybone stands there blinking.}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{hey. aren't you gonna talk me into it?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{no. goodbye. thanks for nothing.}
<A>__{stunned, monkeybone scurries along behind him, pleading.}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{you gotta talk me into it. you'll screw up on your own. i mean, a guy's gotta have a sidekick. for moral support! wisecracks snappy banter }
<P>__{(wrapping himself around stu's leg)}
<D>__{it's the land of death, stu, the land of death! don't go in there without your comedy relief!!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{all right. you can come.}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{oh, thank you! thank you! th }
<P>__{(suddenly realizing)}
<D>__{something went very, very wrong here.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{now we just gotta figure out how to get there.}
<A>__{as if in reply, a pale, spectral presence comes drifting across the dance floor an eight foot tall grim reaper. the boys duck behind a potted plant to watch as he zeroes in on the wet bar where a beautiful coma victim, lulu, is drunkenly making out with another sloshed corpse to be, fred.}
<C>__{reaper}
<D>__{lulu la rue. i have come for you.}
<A>__{lulu doesn't notice. she continues grappling with fred. muttering, the reaper dives in and tries to disentangle them.}
<C>__{reaper}
<D>__{lulu la rue, i have come for }
<C>__{lulu}
<D>__{shay, you're kinda cute.}
<A>__{she ditches fred and throws her arms around the reaper. repulsed, he pushes her away, props her against the nearest wall and touches her with one bony finger above the heart! it's like throwing a switch. her body stiffens. her eyes cross. her tongue droops out of her mouth. she makes a noise like a dial tone. the true horror of death is that it makes you look like a total idiot. the reaper pulls a collapsible hand truck from beneath his shroud and starts maneuvering lulu onto it.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{say there. how 'bout one for the road?}
<A>__{the reaper ignores him. fred holds up a cocktail glass.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{hold this for me, pally.}
<A>__{the reaper heaves a sigh and takes the cocktail glass. fred grabs a pitcher filled with some luminescent tropical concoction... ...and pours it down the reaper's front!}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{ooopsy daisy.}
<A>__{on stu and monkeybone behind the plant wincing at the reaper in his sopping wet, pink stained shroud.}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{is that what they call "death with dignity"?}
<A>__{the reaper wrings out his shroud and grabs the hand truck. as he wheels lulu past the boys, monkeybone pops up with a helpful hint:}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{two words for you, my friend: club soda.}
<A>__{stu claps a hand over mb's mouth as the reaper turns down a hall.}
