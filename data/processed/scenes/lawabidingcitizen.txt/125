<L>__{interior "the dome" day}
<A>__{tight on clyde shoved into the birdcage. the neck poles are disengaged. he moves forward, gazing through the bars...}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i want a phone in my cell. if i'm conducting my own defense, it would be useful. also in case you and i need to be in touch, nick.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(glances at clock)}
<D>__{your twenty four hours are about up. in return for the phone, i will extend you another twelve hours.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{if not?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{how many more people die while you stand around dithering? how many do you get killed before my point starts sinking in?}
<A>__{cantrell closes in, tracking clyde by voice:}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{motherfucker! whatever point you had was lost long ago! eight kids dead in that yard, most of them just out of college! eight! i have to talk to their families. i have to try to explain why their loved ones are dead.}
<A>__{clyde leans down, right in cantrell's face, intense:}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i've been waiting for my explanation for ten years. so far...}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{...nobody's fucking bothered!}
<A>__{beat. cantrell spits in his face, turns away trembling with rage. clyde calmly wipes it off, rises to address them all:}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{if it hasn't dawned on you, this is a war. as in any war, there will be collateral damage. the question, as always, is how much damage you're willing to take before you withdraw.}
<C>__{dunnigan}
<D>__{maybe i got a better idea. maybe we end this war right now.}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{fourteen people dead! i have to say this out loud?}
<P>__{(moving toward clyde)}
<D>__{prisoners die in custody all the time. attacking a guard. trying to escape. shit like that.}
<A>__{clyde, eyes locked, pulls his shirt open here's your target. dunnigan, temper flaring, yanks his revolver and aims.}
<C>__{dunnigan}
<D>__{don't tempt me.}
<C>__{garza}
<D>__{jesus christ, man, dial it back...}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{do it. it would be decisive. stupid, but decisive.}
<P>__{(off dunnigan's look)}
<D>__{can you handle the blowback, detective? the "shit like that?"}
<A>__{nick's stunned, seeing the whole situation spiraling out of control. he steps in, seizing the moment back:}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{put the gun away! are you crazy?}
<C>__{dunnigan}
<P>__{(calmly reholsters)}
<D>__{it's an option. all i'm saying. risk the blowback. ride it out.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{we're not risking anything. or letting him tear us down.}
<P>__{(to clyde)}
<D>__{you're not getting us to throw out the rules, like you. no way.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i like rules. i've wanted you to follow them from the start. like the one that says you prosecute a man who murders my family.}
<P>__{(re buttons)}
<D>__{so. rules. a phone buys you another twelve hours. but if you haven't cut my deal and let me go by the deadline...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what? what then?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i will kill someone in this room.}
<A>__{that sucks the air out of the conversation everybody stares as that sinks in. glances are traded.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{who?}
<A>__{he looks at the room full of people, scans their faces as if trying to pick. he points his finger, starts going from one end of the group to the other...}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{eenie...meenie...miney...moe...}
<A>__{...from person to person, to the end, moving back again...}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{...my mother...told me...to pick...a person...and that...person...is...}
<A>__{he lands on cantrell. silence. cantrell obviously can't see.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{who's he pointing at?}
