<L>__{exterior betty's neighborhood later}
<A>__{betty enters a modest residential neighborhood and pulls into a driveway. she parks in a detached garage and looks over at the cardboard david. there's no way he's going in the house. she puts him in the trunk and closes the garage door.}
<L>__{exterior sue ann's house same time}
<A>__{she walks several houses down. on her way to the door we hear a dog barking, children and general commotion from inside. sue ann rogers answers betty's knock. her hair is matted with sweat as she struggles with children, ages 4, 3 and 6 months. suddenly, sue ann is hit by an errant rubber ball.}

<D>__{hey, darling... oww! sorry, got my own little gulf war going on here.}
