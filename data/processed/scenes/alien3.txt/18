<D>__{you won't be able to fight it... you don't know what it is !}
<A>__{she's put into the cage. the door is secured. two monks begins to pull the ropes. the cage is lifted out over the abyss a vast cavernesque space. the other monks move closer. crowd around the edge john pushes through them right to the edge watches as the cage is slowly lowered down... ripley looks directly at john }

<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{i had that wood earmaked for the cloister next winter. well, we might not get to the winter if we don't take care of this. by winter time we can start taking the penitent cells apart. no one in them.}
<C>__{another tribunal monk}
<D>__{the wood isn't going to last forever.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{neither are we }

<D>__{yes, and you did a good job. you shouldn't feel responsible. you couldn't have known }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{please, sir, let me finish. i feel that there may be something to what she says.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{there isn't.}
<A>__{the abbot moves to his table, begins to gather up his gavel, notebook. john follows him }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't understand what you are doing.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{this colony is my responsibility. i am protecting the colony.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{from what? this woman? you never gave her a chance. how can you be so sure you're right?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{a better question is what makes you think i'm wrong?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you didn't see this thing this demon brother graham and i we both saw it.}
<C>__{abbot}
<P>__{(realizes)}
<D>__{that's right. you both did.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and what was it?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i i don't know what it was. but i don't think ripley was a party to it.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{she admits she brought it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{but she tried to warn us }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{you know that's how the devil works. deception.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{but i believe her. i don't know how to describe it a feeling.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{you haven't seen a woman in thirty years. where does this feeling originate, john?}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(points to his head)}

<A>__{the abbot snaps at him }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{don't think.}
<A>__{john takes a step back at the abbot's tone. a tone he's never heard before. the abbot runs a hand through his thinning hair. forces a smile.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{it's been a long night. for all of us. you really don't understand what you're dealing with here.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that's what she said.}
<A>__{the abbot chafes.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{these are ideas which threaten the very system we live under. the creature is dead and the woman is gone. forget them. both. go read. go fishing. go anywhere, but leave this alone.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{but i }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{alone. i will get philip to let mattias into the library, all right? for your own good, just stay out of this.}
<A>__{john looks like he's going to protest.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{i mean it.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{yes, father.}
<A>__{john turns and leaves the room. the abbot stares after him.}
