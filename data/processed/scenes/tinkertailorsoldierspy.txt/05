<A>__{a woman, connie sachs, a face that's seen it all, leans against a wall, smoking. a middle aged woman, one of the secretaries or "mothers" walks past, pushing a trolley of documents. she nods at connie mournfully. connie looks stricken. the mother walks on into...}
<L>__{interior circus conference room day}
<A>__{a long conference table. we are looking at an elderly man at the head of the table. he's sitting on a rather ornate carving chair a little like a throne and he looks ill. he is signing documents, his signature a simple "c," scrawled in green ink, aware all eyes are on him. a cigarette burns away in an already loaded ashtray. this is the head of the circus known as control. around him are four lieutenants the inner circle of the intelligence service percy alleline, toby esterhase, roy bland and bill haydon. beside him, his right hand man george smiley. from the thick and embarrassed atmosphere we might guess we are at the end of a coup, the final ousting of a king. all we hear is the ticking of a loud clock and the scratch of the pen. smiley looks up to find alleline's gaze fixed on him. alleline quickly looks down at his hands. close on smiley as he examines the others, gauging the shift of power occurring in the room. bill haydon handsome, urbane, frowning with tension, pulls on his cigarette. roy bland heavy set and moustached, flicking a guilty look up at smiley and away. toby esterhase immaculate hair and suit, eyes on alleline, watching for a cue, like a dog told to `stay'. no one will look at him. on smiley realising there is no hope. control finishes, puts the pen back in his pocket. he hands the file to the mother who, red eyed, walks with it out of the room.}

<A>__{beat. the clock suddenly gives a discordant chime as it sounds the hour. a hint of bitter amusement on control's face, as though he's been waiting for this wrong little note to make his move. he grinds his cigarette out. toby can't wait any longer.}

<D>__{what about smiley?}
<A>__{control looks at smiley. his gaze impersonal... on smiley the faintest flicker in his eyes as he tries to prepare himself for the shock of dismissal.}
