<C>__{woman}
<D>__{...see the villain's eyes. they're larger than the other characters'. they insinuate a slightly skewed perspective of how they see the world. just off normal.}
<A>__{david stares at the drawing.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{he doesn't look very threatening.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{that's what i said to my son. he said, there's always two kinds. the soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. the brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.}
<A>__{david turns and looks at the striking and beautiful african american woman in her sixties who stands next to him.}

<C>__{david}
<D>__{he's kind of a miracle.}

<A>__{they both watch elijah from across the room.}
<C>__{elijah's mother}
<D>__{i will tell him you're here.}
<A>__{david watches as elijah's mother walks across the store and waits for elijah to finish talking. david turns back to the framed sketch. he looks at it with his hands in his pockets. beat. david's stare turns into a gaze. his gaze turns into stillness. the sketch is of a withered man with large tense eyes. he sits in the shadows. he's seated in some type of machine. there are lots of buttons and levers on the machine. the machine has wheels. david turns from the sketch. he looks across the room to elijah seated in his wheelchair. elijah's large eyes stay focused on the customer's as he finishes negotiating. david turns back to the sketch. he looks at it with growing confusion. the more you look at drawing, the more the machine the man is seated in looks like a wheelchair. david looks back across the store. elijah and his mother are talking. elijah has spotted david. beat. elijah starts across the crowded store towards david. he wheels up to him.}

<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{when i saw it this morning. i felt a part of the world again.}
<A>__{elijah looks down at the newspaper. david hesitates and then reaches forward. he reaches past the paper... and touches elijah's arm. flashcut: an airport gate. elijah is standing at the window looking out onto the airfield. he's crying.}
