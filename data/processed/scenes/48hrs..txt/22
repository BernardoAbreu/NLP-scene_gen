<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's number twenty two... you want company?}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{no, no thanks.}
<A>__{the guard shrugs, stays by the door.}
<B>__{cates}
<A>__{he walks down the cell block. inmates stare at him from inside the stark cells. they don't know who he is, but they can smell a cop. cates stops at twenty two, looks inside... a bit startled. obviously, reggie hammond has connections and taste. the paint is fresh; there's framed prints on the wall instead of pin ups, and the overall feeling is that of a graduate school dorm rather than a prison. cates turns, nods to the guard at the end of the cell block. he throws a switch and the door opens. hammond's cell cates steps inside. hammond is at a table wearing a sony walkman and writing in some detailed ledgers with a fountain pen. he's boogeying in his seat to the music. sprawled on a bunk nearby is leroy, another black inmate close to hammond's age. leroy is leafing through a copy of a skin magazine. he doesn't even look at cates.}

<C>__{cates}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hammond!}
<A>__{hammond jumps, grabs his ears in pain ... he pulls the headset off and glares at cates.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you got a name, cop?}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{try cates. and let's talk in private, okay?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{sure, anything you want.}
<A>__{he tosses the walkman to leroy who dutifully puts it on.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{look, convict, i know all about you. single. no fixed address. no known relatives. one previous conviction. armed robbery... six months to go on a three year sentence.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you here to write my life story?}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{not likely, reggie. maybe i just need some help.}
<A>__{cates takes the forensic photo out of his pocket, passes it across the table to hammond. he looks at it, hardly reacts.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{henry wong... my old pal. he's looked better...}
<A>__{he passes the photo back.}
<C>__{hammond}
<P>__{(continuing)}

<A>__{cates swings the cell door back open.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{too bad, reggie. i thought maybe you were a smart boy. but i guess if you were real smart you wouldn't be a convict.}
<A>__{he smiles, decides to play his card.}
<C>__{cates}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i can see a second rater like you wouldn't be any help at all goin' up against a real hard case like ganz.}
<A>__{hammond jerks his head around.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{ganz?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{hammond}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ganz the one who shot henry? cates, i asked you a question...}

<C>__{cates}
<D>__{yeah, i noticed...}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{ganz is in jail. he's gonna be there two years after i'm on the street.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{didn't work out that way. he busted out with a big indian. they capped two guards on a road gang. nice meeting you reggie.}
<A>__{he turns, goes out. the door clangs behind him. hammond jumps up and bangs on the bars, shouts at cates' back...}
