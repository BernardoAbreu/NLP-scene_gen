<L>__{interior parent's bedroom morning}
<A>__{kelly looks in at his parents, checking to make sure they're still asleep. when he leaves abe opens his eyes and listens to the door close downstairs.}
<L>__{interior eve's studio}
<A>__{kelly throws some paints and brushes into his backpack.}
<L>__{exterior bowland house day}
<A>__{kelly stands awkwardly on the front stoop with his backpack. minnie opens the door.}
<C>__{minnie}
<D>__{kelly? bart's not here, he }
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{oh, that's all right. actually, i'm here to see tabby. just to do a little painting with her.}
<C>__{minnie}
<D>__{she's out back in her studio.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{thanks.}
<L>__{interior tabby's studio}
<A>__{tabby stands barefoot in the sunlight, a palette knife in her hand. music's playing. jeff buckley. she looks over as the door opens, surprised.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{kelly?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{hey. i warned you i'd come.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{you did.}
<A>__{she goes back to painting. kelly stands there for a minute, waiting for her to say something else, give him an invitation. she doesn't. until she looks up and sees him standing in the same place.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{maybe i should go }
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{well you're here now. go ahead. set your canvas up. use one of the ones in the corner.}
<A>__{kelly looks through them and picks one.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{brushes are in the jar. paint's in the drawer.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i brought my own.}
<A>__{he takes off his backpack and opens it.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{well then.}
<A>__{kelly busies himself pulling out paints and other supplies. he can't help but look at her. the light hits her hair and she glows. she catches him looking.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{does it mess up your concentration? me being here?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she turns back to her painting.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{oh. that's good.}
<A>__{kelly sets up his canvas.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{just don't talk.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{why would i?}
<C>__{tabby}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm kidding.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{right. irony. i like that.}
<A>__{kelly feels the tubes of painterior nervous. squirts some color out. looks over his shoulder at her. he's trying to get his act together, to be cool about being there, in the studio, alone with her. trying to figure out how to play it.}
<C>__{miner}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{hey! hey babe.}
<A>__{miner opens the door. see kelly. smiles like the stockbroker he is and crosses to him.}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{miner webber.}
<A>__{miner holds out his hand for a good old fashioned shake. kelly takes it.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{webber miner.}
<A>__{miner looks confused.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{kelly. this is kelly }
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{kelly ernswiler. sorry. i }
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{quite all right.}
<P>__{(smiles as an afterthought)}
<D>__{so, what do we have here, a little painting class?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{kelly's a friend of bart's. he paints.}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{oh? what's your real job?}
<A>__{kelly smiles eagerly at miner over the edge of his canvas.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{that would be stock boy at the shop rite. but, as president don kaminsky says, every employee is part owner. so you could say i'm a captain of industry in training. kind of capitalist larva.}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{that's quite an image.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{only if you see the most magical part. do you see?}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{kelly spreads his arms out and flaps them a little.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{one day i will be a beautiful butterfly. first i will have to be a pupa though. i figure i won't be going out much then. pupa: the awkward adolescence of the insect world.}
<A>__{miner stares at kelly. he can't tell what he might be making fun of, or if it might be him.}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{whatever it takes to get you through the day.}
<A>__{kelly rolls his eyes at this uninspired response, though miner doesn't see it. he grabs tabby's paintbrush and pulls her to him.}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{i have the afternoon off. come away with me.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{i'm not at a good stopping pointerior}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{oh, come on. they'll still be here.}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{i know you'll still be here.}
<A>__{kelly smiles his most idiotic energetic smile and slaps paint on his canvas in exaggerated strokes.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{i really shouldn't.}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{but everyone will be coming soon. and it will get all crazy, and we won't have any time to ourselves.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{we will. i promise.}
<A>__{tabby kisses miner. he realizes there's no convincing her and sighs.}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{like tonight? we can practice honeymoon suite.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{maybe. probably.}
<A>__{miner looks at kelly, who looks away. then he puts his hands in his pockets and leaves. tabby and kelly paint in silence for a while. kelly moves around to look at his canvas from different angles, like he's copying what he thinks a painter would do.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{is he always like that?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{overbearing.}
<A>__{tabby stops and puts down her brush.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{just because he didn't want to picture you as a pupa?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{oh, he will later. when he's alone. whether he wants to or not.}
<A>__{kelly paints.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{not that though. how he wanted you to stop.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{he wants to be with me. what's so bad about that?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{just because some one wants to be with you doesn't mean they're good for you.}
<A>__{kelly is suddenly very involved with his painting. he has a hard time making eye contact with tabby.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{no one should ever ask you to stop. if you stop, you might not be able to start again. or you might start again, only things will be different.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{well, that's sweet }
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{it's not sweet, actually. it's just the truth.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{hey, i can take care of myself.}
<A>__{she picks up her brush.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{when's the wedding?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{at the end of the month. but don't ask me about it. it makes me nervous.}
<A>__{kelly looks at her seriously.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{why? is something wrong?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{awkward silence.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{what are you painting?}
<A>__{kelly stops and sighs, now back in serious artist mode.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{really, there are so many layers of imagistic symbolism that i really don't feel comfortable summing it up, but, well it's a recurring dream image. a mermaid riding a rocket ship.}
<A>__{tabby stops painting.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what do you mean, "how?" sidesaddle. she's riding it sidesaddle. she's got a fish tail, for chrissake. i haven't decided yet if she's got scuba gear on or not.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{do you have any idea what you're talking about?}
<A>__{kelly puts up his thumb in an approximation of an artist's gesture.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{does that matter?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{well, some people actually say what they really think.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what if they don't know what they really think?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. it's called being yourself.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{sounds boring.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{not boring. scary and wonderful and exciting.}
<A>__{kelly stops squeezing paint onto his palette. his gestures slow down. he's taking this in. then he shakes it off.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{hey. i'm trying to create here. stop distracting me.}
