<A>__{in the next container, fry waits anxiously. hissing through the escape hatch:}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{imam? where are they?}
<L>__{interior fifth container cargo hold night}
<A>__{close on a predator's scythe blade. it test slices the pilgrim's skin. blood wells up. all clicking ceases.}
<C>__{imam }
<D>__{hasan?}
<C>__{fry }
<D>__{riddick?}
<A>__{tight on the pilgrim more scared now that the clicking has stopped. losing his nerve, he bolts.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{no.... the predators are on him , just blurs in the dark. death scream.}
<A>__{riddick's pov: a third predator appears above him. making his move, riddick darts around cargo and heads for the escape hatch as... fry's light catches him square in the face. blinded, riddick howls and stumbles forward. fry's light leaps deeper to hit... the predator right behind him . with a similar reaction, the beast howls and flails back. hold on fry for a time stopped moment. what stopped it? was it really her? suddenly a shotgun explodes beside her head. jacked up, johns is blasting shadows.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{stop it, stop it, stop it!}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{'sokay, 'sokay. i killed it.}
<A>__{they give him a look. "sure you did." suddenly a carcass slams to the floor , sending everyone jumping back in a perfect splash pattern. "christ, he did kill one." fry reclaims her dropped light and beams it on the carcass. wherever the light strikes it, the flesh chars and steams.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{there....}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{like the light is scalding it.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{it hurts them. light actually hurts them....}
<A>__{vulture sounds from the two o.s. adolescents, fighting over the scraps of the pilgrim.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{is that...hasan?}
<A>__{riddick nods.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{we'll burn a candle for him later. c'mon.}
