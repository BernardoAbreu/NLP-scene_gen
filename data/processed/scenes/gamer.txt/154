<L>__{interior humanz headquarters moments later}
<A>__{a dark, underground video arcade... low ceilings, concrete; old school sort of a graveyard of lost games... the classics of the 80s missile command, defender, robotron, crank, etc. the dimensions of the room are impossible to determine. a dozen or so people just black silhouettes in the cathode ray glow are scattered around, banging buttons, giving it body english, racking up scores. trace leads kable through, toward the one brightly lit spot: at the center of the arcade, an air hockey table is blasted with white light from above. humanz brother, who we recognize from simon's vid screen, and humanz dude mid 20s, long hair are playing: clackclack, click, clackclunk,}
<B>__{clack...}
<A>__{they are so wrapped up in their game that they don't appear to notice kable. humanz brother smacks a random 3 bank winner.}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{you a fool.}
<C>__{humanz dude}
<D>__{stop playing that freaky shit off the rail.}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{it's a game of deception.}
<C>__{humanz dude}
<D>__{whatever, that's cuz you got no power...}
<A>__{humanz dude measures a shot, rolling the paddle with one finger then lets it rip slamming the game winner in a straight line past humanz brother's frozen paddle score: 7 }
<C>__{humanz dude }
<P>__{(getting in his face)}
<D>__{huh? what?}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{you guys suck.}
<A>__{they turn, suddenly aware of him. humanz dude's paddle hand goes limp; the puck limps in and scores, meaninglessly.}
<C>__{humanz dude}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{kable. holy shit.}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{his name's tillman.}
<C>__{humanz dude}
<D>__{whatever.}
<P>__{(to kable)}
<D>__{you made it. you're really here.}
<A>__{kable looks them over he's not sure what he expected, but it wasn't this.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{you're the ones who broke me out?}
<C>__{trace}
<D>__{we only freed your mind.}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{your ass followed.}
<C>__{humanz dude}
<D>__{hey, kable...}
<A>__{dude seems to be the most affected by kable's presence brother is calm, in the moment; trace is focused, all business... dude is pure fanboy.}
<C>__{humanz dude }
<D>__{you're... great.}
<A>__{humanz brother gives humanz dude a look and shakes his head.}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<P>__{(to kable)}
<D>__{you got questions.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{a few.}
<A>__{he glances over at trace.}
<C>__{kable }
<D>__{she took my blood. why?}
<C>__{humanz dude}
<D>__{the nanex modifies the actual cell structure of your brain...}
<C>__{humanz dude }
<D>__{we can crack it, but it's not one size fits all; we needed your dna to generate custom code.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{alright. why me?}
<C>__{humanz dude}
<D>__{because castle's scared of you.}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{it ain't just a game, you know, tillman. everyday there's more people steppin forward, wanna be a part of castle's world. throwing away everything it means to be human.}
<C>__{trace}
<D>__{right now it's the desperate ones... convicts, addicts... the sick, the poor... the ones that fell through the cracks... they have no choice.}
<C>__{humanz dude}
<D>__{but this is only the beginning.}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{think about it: the federal prison system is growing out of control, set to bankrupt the whole damn usa... castle rides in on a white horse, says he got a plan to bail us out and everyone just fall in line.}
<C>__{trace}
<D>__{so what's next? the health care system is collapsing castle comes to the rescue again...}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{this time he's pushin total control of genetic disease... birth defects a thing of the past... all we gotta do is exchange our cells for the ones he wanna give us.}
<C>__{trace}
<D>__{the promise of a longer life and a fatter wallet you think people will refuse?}
<C>__{humanz dude}
<D>__{hell no.}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{they'll be standing in line to hand their babies over to him. next thing you know, we all slaves.}
<C>__{trace}
<D>__{we can't let that happen.}
<C>__{humanz dude}
<D>__{gotta bring the man down.}
<C>__{trace}
<D>__{you can help us, tillman.}
<P>__{(with urgency)}
<D>__{you have to help us.}
<A>__{kable takes this in, and starts to walk away.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{i can't help you.}
<C>__{humanz brother}
<D>__{tillman.}
<A>__{kable ignores him he's out. but humanz brother freezes him in his tracks:}
<C>__{humanz brother }
<D>__{we know where she is.}
