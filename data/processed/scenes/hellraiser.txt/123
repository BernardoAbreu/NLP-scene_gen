<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{a shadow moves across the screen as the door opens, and larry puts on the light. he has hold of julia's hand. he leads her inside. she sits on the bed, illuminated by the light from the landing, and the occasional flicker from the window. larry kneels between her legs, and kisses her breasts, his eyes closed. julia glances into the shadows of the room. she senses frank's presence.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{... oh babe ...}
<A>__{he starts to unbutton her dress. she's distracted by her suspicions; he has his hands against her almost before she realizes what's happening. we have her p.o.v. as she looks around the room. the dressing table; the wardrobe; the curtains at the window. does something move in the shadows? a flash of lightning. no. there's nothing. larry gets onto the bed and draws her against him, kissing her. this is not the intense, slightly dangerous love making she experienced with frank, but a fumbling, slightly foolish exchange. larry is so wrapped in attempting to make the right moves he doesn't register the fact that julia's attention is elsewhere. now we have a p.o.v. from the far side of the room, of the two figures on the bed, the only sound the thunder and larry's murmured words of seduction, which we can barely make out.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{...i love you, honey ... let me ... oh god ... i love you ...}
<A>__{neither of them have undressed fully; there's just a tangle of clothes around them which removes any trace of eroticism from the scene. a close up of julia's head, laid on the pillow, shows just how uninvolved she is while larry works, eyes closed. julia looks down the length of her husband's body. the door of the wardrobe swings open. frank is watching. she registers horror. larry is oblivious to all of this, of course. we have a close up of frank watching the love making. now he steps out of the wardrobe. julia makes a moan of horror, which larry takes as enthusiasm.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{oh baby ... i love you ...}
<A>__{from julia's p.o.v., we see the form of frank shamble towards the lovers. from frank's p.o.v. we see the lovers on the bed, larry's back vunerable. julia seems to realize what he intends.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{... no ...}
<A>__{larry barely hears her. frank is at the very end of the bed now, and julia becomes highly agitated.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{no. no, you mustn't. please. no.}
<A>__{larry stops his love making.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(looks at her)}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{please ...}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{what's wrong with you?}
<C>__{julia}
<P>__{(almost sobbing)}
<D>__{please. i can't bear it ...}
<A>__{larry is angered and utterly perplexed at this. he disengages his arms from around her. julia's p.o.v., as frank retreats. larry rolls off julia. the wardrobe door closes. click.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i don't understand you. one moment you're all over me, the next it's: don't touch me.}
<A>__{he sits on the edge of the bed.}
<D>__{i just don't understand.}
<A>__{he gets up and leaves the bedroom. julia remains where she is. we have a shot of the bed, and her upon it, from frank's end of the room. she stares at the wardrobe. through the crack of the open door, frank stares back. a flicker of lightning illuminates his face; his skeletal grin. softly, beneath the assault of the rain on the roof, we hear laughter.}
