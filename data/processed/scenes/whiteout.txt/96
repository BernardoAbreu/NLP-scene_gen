<A>__{carrie enters. light streaming in through the window hits her tired face. she reaches for the light switch on the nearby wall a hand grabs hers aggressively yanks her away from the open door. it's kicked closed as she's drawn backwards into a man's embrace. a knife's brought to her neck.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(raspy, deep)}
<D>__{...you stetko?}

<D>__{don't...}
<A>__{she stops.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{he slowly turns her around to face him. it's rubin, but he looks beat to shit. deep cracks slice across his bloody, chapped lips. peeling skin flakes on his face. desperate, despondent eyes. shaky, frostbitten fingers. he's having a hard time holding it together as he can barely get the words out...}
<C>__{rubin}
<D>__{ did mooney talk to you? i didn't hear from him he was supposed to call me after you talked.}

<A>__{his shaking hands slowly lowers it she breathes a little easier. he sets it down on an empty book shelf next to him.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{who's after you? where are the cannisters?}
<A>__{he stares off blankly }
<C>__{rubin}
<D>__{weiss didn't want to go through with it. oh god. how did we let this happen?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{rubin i need you to focus for me.}
<A>__{he tries. looks at her through tired, pinched eyes he's trying. o.c. knock. knock on her door. rubin is spooked. glares at her scared. like a caged animal.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{carrie, it's doc got those painkillers.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{it's okay, he's a doctor, he can help you.}
<A>__{it falls on deaf ears he goes for the knife. she tries to stop him. rubin shoves her aside, throwing her against a chair. she topples backwards. he whips open the door, driving an unexpected shoulder into doc, who gets nailed so hard, he goes stumbling back up against the wall behind him. takes the wind right out of him. pills all over the floor. rubin dashes off down the hallway it's an effort. carrie appears at the door. catches a glimpse of rubin disappearing down a set of side stairs.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{you alright?}
<A>__{doc nods. she takes off after him, pulling her phone off her hip.}
<B>__{at the stairs}
