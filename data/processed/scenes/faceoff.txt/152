<C>__{priest}
<D>__{we are here to celebrate the life of victor lazarro. we all know him as a man who dedicated himself to defending this great nation first, as a highly decorated admiral then, as west coast director of the f.b.i. but not all of you know what a deeply spiritual man he was. it was his wish that his requiem mass be performed in latin.}

<A>__{checks her watch... barely lifting her eyes away... castor absently pats her knee. she's forced to return focus to the service.}
<B>__{archer}
<A>__{chambers the dart, twists a knob on the range finder, and carefully peers over the crucifix.}
<B>__{through scope}
<A>__{archer tracks through the mourners and finds castor. as the cross hairs neatly cube his head...}
<B>__{back to scene}

<D>__{requiem aeternam dona eis, domine... amen.}
<A>__{full screen trigger archer's finger wraps around he starts to squeeze... pov through scope figure crosses behind castor, blocking archer's shot. archer's finger freezes as the figure turns hair tumbling away from her face. it's jamie.}

<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{thanks anyway, mom }

<D>__{but i wanted to be here for you... and dad.}
<A>__{castor reads the panic on eve's face, but says nothing. he simply takes jamie's hand, intertwining his fingers in hers. the honor guard steps forward, shouldering their rifles, commencing their 21 gun salute as }
<B>__{archer}
<A>__{steadies himself, re aims the sniper rifle. he hears motion behind him. someone's coming and fast... but this is his only chance. off balance, archer squeezes thffft! the silenced trank dart explodes from the barrel.}

<A>__{screaming toward castor's neck but it goes just wide. it sinks harmlessly into the grass unnoticed during the 21 gun salute.}
<B>__{on knoll}
<A>__{thump! archer is cracked across the head. he slumps down, unconscious, as a silenced gun barrel gently enters his ear. as the saluting guns fire in the b.g. we don't know when, or if, this pistol fires... at sea side service the honor guard presents the urn to mrs. lazarro. fearful, eve chances a glance around wondering what's gone wrong.}
