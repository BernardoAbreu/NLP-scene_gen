<A>__{a shot of a 1930's automobile in the hillyer driveway at night as it drives up and stops before the front steps. another angle, close on rose and dave wilkie in the car. here dave is much younger, of course, and a rather handsome man in a stolid way. even though he is younger than when we saw him on the plane, he is quite a bit older than rose. rose's eyes are opened wide, she is a bit breathless, obviously something important has happened. dave stares at her as if fascinated, almost as if awed.}
