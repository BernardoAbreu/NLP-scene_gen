<A>__{the peaceful quiet of the asylum is shattered by a fire alarm. soon all the inmates start filing out into the yard, loosely herded by the guards. erwin files out with the others, still wearing his straight jacket. erwin looks over at the parking lot jesse's car flashes it's lights. erwin starts to casually wander off towards the fence between himself and freedom when the security guard spots him and says:}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{hey, erwin... where do you think you're going?}
<A>__{erwin ignores him, still moving towards the fence.}
<C>__{security guard}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm talking to you, asshole!}
<A>__{erwin breaks into a run. the guard takes off after him. in the car, jesse, meagan, and stormie watch as the guard closes the distance.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{he's not going to make it.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{we've got to do something!}
<A>__{with grim determination, jesse starts his car. jesse's car tears out of the parking lot, racing for the fence. with a loud, metallic ching, jesse's car drives into the fence, knocking that section down. erwin dances over the downed chain link, diving into an open window. then, with a squeal of tires and the rending of metal, jesse's car backs out of the fence, does a 180, and peels off. angle inside car as stormie and meagan help erwin out of his straight jacket. once freed, erwin extends his hand to jesse.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{hi, my name's erwin. thanks for busting me out of there!}
<A>__{jesse looks at erwin's outstretched hand the fingertips are all heavily bandaged.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{yeah, right... look, erwin, just do me one favor don't eat nothing disgusting. my stomach is tight enough as it is.}
<A>__{the security guard runs up to the fence, huffing and puffing, watching as jesse's car disappears down the street. then he spots something in the fence and plucks it out... jesse's front license plate.}
