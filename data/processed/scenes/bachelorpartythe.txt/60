<L>__{interior. the bedroom}
<A>__{charlie is seated on the bed, hunched, in deep depression. he is holding the ten dollar bill. his eyes are open, but there is a feeling of hurt and pain on his face. helen moves quietly into the bedroom and sits down on the bed beside him.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what's the matter, charlie?}
<A>__{he shrugs, even smiles briefly.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{she puts out her hand as if to take his head and press it against her, but he takes her in his arms almost desperately, and they lie back on the bed, clutching each other, their faces pressed against each other, seeking some kind of strength just from the sheer physical closeness of each other.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it's not so bad, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i know. i know.}
<A>__{they lie quietly, even stiffly, holding each other.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(eyes wide open but unseeing)}
<D>__{i don't know what's the matter with me, i keep getting so depressed. i'm going to quit night school, helen. my nerves are shot.}
<A>__{he releases himself from his wife's embrace and sits up.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{those guys are waiting outside. i better give them their money.}
<A>__{he stands and starts out the bedroom.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{charlie ... maybe i shouldn't have the baby?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what do you mean? ...}
<A>__{she doesn't answer. she doesn't have to. they both know what she means.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{isn't that dangerous? ... well, i don't know ... maybe ... well, you brought it up.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(shocked after a moment)}
<D>__{you really don't want this baby....}
<A>__{she turns away on the bed to hide the sudden flush of tears.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you're my husband, charlie. this is your baby too. that doesn't mean anything to you. for the first time in our marriage i feel i can't depend on you, charlie i'm not important to you.}
<P>__{(she has to stop}
<D>__{because she can no longer trust her voice. after a}
<P>__{moment she continues)}
<D>__{i could make my life sound hard, too, charlie. i work all day, i rush home, i make you dinner. i sit home alone four nights a week, i'm even alone when you're here because when do i see you? but it was easy for me because i loved you. do you think i care whether you're an accountant or a ditch digger, or even out of work? all i ever wanted was you. and this baby because it's you, too.}
<A>__{she closes her eyes again to hide the warm flow of tears in her eyes and stops talking rather than cry. charlie sits, unmoved and wretched, his shoulders hunched, his head slumped forward. after a moment, he turns and reaches forward, quite frightened, to touch her arm.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(dully)}
<D>__{leave me alone, charlie.}
<A>__{he stands and goes to the bedroom window and looks out. helen turns on her side so that her back is to him. at the sound of her moving, charlie turns his head, but sensing the rejection in her back, he turns back and looks out the window again. the silence is thick between them.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(looking out the window)}
<D>__{i decided i'd quit school and ...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i don't care ...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i decided i'd quit school and come home in the evenings like everybody else and live a normal life.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(staring at the wall ahead of her)}
<D>__{i don't care what you do, charlie.}
<A>__{he stands another moment.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't care what i do either.}
<A>__{helen neither moves nor makes a response. charlie goes on into the living room and shuffles to the front door, his long body heavy with pain and guilt and dense, unknown terrors. he opens the door and goes out onto the landing.}
