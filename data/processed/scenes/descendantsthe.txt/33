<L>__{exterior ocean outrigger restaurant day}
<A>__{scottie pops two last fries into her mouth, then turns her attention to a strawberry sundae. anxious to spoil her, matt watches scottie dig in. yet he remains preoccupied, his smile distant.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{the food here at the club is so good.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah, they do a good job here.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{why is it called a jellyfish? it's not a fish, and it's not jelly.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no idea. you ask good questions. you're getting too smart for me, scottie.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{i'm going to find out. then i'm going to ask mom when she wakes up and see if she knows. do you think she's going to know everything she used to know?}
<A>__{matt notices a buff guy and some friends headed to a nearby table, and his mood sours. scottie follows his gaze. the guy notices the kings and feels obliged to mosey over. this is troy cook athletic and rich.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{hi, matt. hi, scottie.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{troy.}
<C>__{troy}
<P>__{(to his friends)}
<D>__{i will catch up to you guys in a second.}
<A>__{matt stares so intensely that troy averts his gaze.}
<C>__{troy }
<D>__{so, uh, what's going on? i mean, how's elizabeth doing?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{same.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{i visited her last week, you know. i thought she looked pretty good.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{so why'd you ask?}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{i don't know, i just wanted to know the latest. i'm praying for her every day, you guys. really hard. seriously. so what i was saying was, when i was there, i talked to her, and her hand moved, so i was pretty encouraged. i thought that was an encouraging sign.}
<A>__{scottie looks up hopefully. matt notices.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{that's enough.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{i really think she heard me.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{look, troy, go to your friends. no hard feelings. let's just leave it alone.}
<A>__{troy walks away, stops, turns back.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{i told you, matt, there were lots of chops and holes that day. i told you a hundred times. ask anybody. what happened to her could have happened to me. it was a super hard day on the water.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you weren't supposed to be driving, troy. she was supposed to be driving.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{she wanted me to drive. and she's the one who told me to pass the other boat right before the turn. and just your whole attitude toward me, matt i mean, i feel terrible. i wish it were me and not her. plus i almost drowned myself when we capsized. and my rotator cuff is never going to be the same, and i'm going to miss moloka'i.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{just because her hand moved, it doesn't mean anything, troy. mom twitches at weird times. when you cut off a chicken's head, it runs all around, but it's still a dead chicken.}
<A>__{scottie pushes back from the table and takes off toward the pool. matt follows, not even gracing troy with a final look.}
