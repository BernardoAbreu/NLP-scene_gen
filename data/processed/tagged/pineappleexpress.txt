<L>__{exterior farmland dawn}
<A>__{in black and white, a black 1930s cadillac speeds down the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland. the road curves sharply ahead the car accelerates. ignoring the turn, the caddy drives directly off the road and through a massive field of emptiness. the car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field. general brat (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and agent black suit (an agent in a black suit) step out of the car. although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the general scans his surroundings with concern. title card up: the past agent black suit crouches down and pulls open a metal hatch in the ground. both men walk down the hatch and into the earth.}
<L>__{interior underground facility moments later}
<A>__{they descend a metal staircase and walk with great urgency down a narrow corridor. the hallway spills into a hauntingly huge metal room with a lone scientist standing in the middle. the scientist immediately begins leading them across the room.}
<C>__{general brat}
<D>__{when did it start?}
<C>__{scientist}
<D>__{at 05:00. we're seven minutes in.}
<L>__{interior observation lab continuous}
<A>__{the three men enter a large room divided by a one way mirror. on their side, numerous scientists, utilizing several archaic devices, are busy at work monitoring the subject on the other side of the mirror. the subject: private miller (22, naive and dutiful) sits at a small table with a microphone on it. miller raises his hand, revealing a smoldering jointerior he takes a long and awkward hit from the joint and bursts into a coughing fit. the scientists begin to scribble profusely as their devices blink manically. general brat and agent black suit exchange a concerned look. the general lights a cigarette as the scientist steps up to a small microphone in the corner.}
<C>__{scientist}
<P>__{(into microphone)}
<D>__{private miller, we are now going to ask you several questions. how do you feel?}
<A>__{his voice booms through large speakers on miller's side of the room. miller leans towards the microphone.}
<C>__{private miller}
<D>__{uh, i feel a little queer sir. but... it's good. good queer.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sir. good queer, sir.}
<A>__{the scientists scribble madly. one of them mumbles into general brat's ear.}
<C>__{private miller }
<D>__{but...uh...even though i feel queer, sir, i should mention that i'm also feeling quite gay...so, a little queer, but mostly gay.}
<C>__{scientist}
<D>__{private miller. when you think of your superiors, what emotions do you feel?}
<C>__{private miller}
<P>__{(holding out the joint)}
<D>__{this went out...sir.}
<C>__{scientist}
<D>__{we will send someone in. now answer the question.}
<A>__{a door opens beside private miller and an agent steps out wearing an intricate uniform that resembles an old fashioned diving suit, an air hose leading out the door that he came from. he slowly walks toward the private, who looks at him in shock.}
<D>__{scientist (cont'd) (o.s)}
<P>__{(through speakers)}
<D>__{private miller? answer the question.}
<C>__{private miller}
<D>__{oh...um...what was the question again?}
<A>__{the agent in the strange suit reaches the private and holds a lighter up to the jointerior}
<C>__{scientist }
<P>__{(through speakers)}
<D>__{what are your emotions towards your superiors?}
<A>__{miller pulls at the joint until it is lit again. the agent exits the room.}
<C>__{private miller}
<D>__{cough cough fucking shit.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, now that i think of it, it's strange that they are called my `superiors'. does that make me their `inferior'? i mean, that's pretty fucked up.}
<A>__{general brat scowls.}
<C>__{general brat}
<P>__{(curtly to the scientists)}
<D>__{i've seen enough. shut it down. bury the hatch, sell the land, and dispose of him. this never happened.}
<A>__{instantly, the scientists start packing up their equipment. staring at miller, general brat grabs a red phone and dials. two agents in the scuba like suits emerge from behind miller and start aggressively dragging him away.}
<C>__{private miller}
<P>__{(freaking out)}
<D>__{hey! what the...what are you guys doing! let go of me!}
<P>__{(desperately looking at the mirror)}
<D>__{sir!!! sir!!! help me!!!}
<C>__{general}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{this is general brat. we've reached a final conclusion on item 9.}
<P>__{(beat)}

<L>__{interior dale's car continuous}
<A>__{dale denton (late 20s, out of shape, slightly unkempt) looks out of place in his black suit as he drives he sits in his cluttered and worn old lady car. he smokes a joint while listening to talk radio.}
<C>__{talk radio dj}
<D>__{well, let's look at the facts. financially, coins are better because they're cheaper, and environmentally, forget about it, coins win hands down. for those just joining us, we're with caller dale denton discussing if america should lose the paper dollar bill.}
<A>__{we see that dale has a wireless ear piece in.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{of course not! who wants a pocket full of coins? seriously. weighs down your pants, clangs around. with all this unnecessary new security everywhere, we'll be setting off alarms left and right!}
<C>__{talk radio dj}
<D>__{we certainly do, mr. denton. crude, but to the pointerior next caller!}
<A>__{dale puts away his phone and pulls up in front of a nice house.}
<L>__{exterior front door moments later}
<A>__{dale, wearing a name tag that reads "garth", holding a clip board and wearing a greenpeace hat, knocks repeatedly on the door. a woman cautiously answers the door.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{um, i didn't order a pizza.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{excuse me, miss? are you sandra danby}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{uh...yea }
<A>__{dale shoves an envelope into her hand.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{sorry, miss, but you've failed to show up to your divorce proceedings 4 times under court order. you've been served.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{oh great! thanks a lot asshole! real clever! go fuck yourself!}
<A>__{dale dashes back to his car as the upset woman starts to open the envelope.}
<L>__{interior dale's car soon after}
<A>__{dale is driving and smoking a jointerior he looks at his check list it is a list of people he served that day. he's only got a few left. he listens to a different talk radio dj while playing music from a tiny ipod boom box that sits in his passenger seat.}
<C>__{talk radio dj 2}
<D>__{...forget about area 51, roswell sightings, atlantis and the boogie man, let's talk about real threats, threats to our home and security...}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{fuckin' eh.}
<A>__{his ipod starts playing hot steppa by ini kamoze.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{nice! hot steppa!}
<A>__{dale turns down the talk radio and puffs away at his joint; he enthusiastically dances in his car while singing along.}

<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{just here to check out some units.}
<A>__{the secretary nods and goes back to her work. dale casually waltzes down the office halls looking at the names on the doors. he glances down at his clipboard, it read: walter tandum. he finds the office and knocks on the door.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{dale enters to see walter, a 40 year old accountant, seated at his desk.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{oh! hey there. are you here to fix the fax machines?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{nope.}
<A>__{dale drops a blue envelope on walter's desk.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{you owe american express $4068 dollars. sorry, but you've been served.}
<A>__{dale turns and walks away. as he does, he notices a small kitchen. he enters and is delighted at the array of snacks and beverages. he helps himself.}
<L>__{interior dale's car later}
<A>__{dale is parked at a look out enjoying the food, smoking weed and has his ear piece in.}
<C>__{radio dj 3}
<D>__{what gives you the right to say that?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{everything! they should be able to collect garbage twice a week. why not?}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{as a tax payer, can't i say that? come get my garbage a bit more! is that so f ing crazy? i'm not asking for free beer tuesday's or anything. and the whole city would be more aesthetically pleasing and smell better. and don't pretend you can't smell it. ever been to new york? great place, smells like piss, though.}
<P>__{(takes a hit and starts coughing)}
<D>__{twice a week, cough might fix that.}
<P>__{(starts coughing harder)}
<D>__{hold on one sec.}
<L>__{exterior hospital later}
<A>__{dale gets out of his car, followed by some plumes of smoke, and goes to his trunk. he chuckles as he takes out a lab coat and walks towards the hospital.}
<L>__{interior hospital soon after}
<A>__{dale, looking very professional in his lab coat, rushes to reception.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i need dr. terrence, immediately.}

<C>__{dale}
<D>__{dr. edgar terrence. you're the guy who repeatedly refused to take care of the monkey tree that spills onto your neighbors property. and now, because of that, you've been served.}
<L>__{interior dale's car later}
<A>__{dale hits a pipe. it is clear he strongly disagrees with what the dj is saying.}
<C>__{talk radio dj}
<D>__{...stay in your own country. five simple words. and stay the hell out of mine! i'm not a racist, per se, but i'm not some hippy tree humper.}

<D>__{ah fuck!}
<P>__{(reads more)}
<D>__{fuck! you fucking asshole!!! fuck!}
<A>__{dale completely ignores corber as he dumps the sign and walks out of the airport. then, a huge smile comes across his face. he has noticed a nearby burger king.}
<C>__{dale}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{hey! nice. new chicken fries.}
<A>__{he happily walks toward the food.}
<L>__{int dale's car day}
<A>__{dale sits in his car outside a high school. an array of burger king wrappers surrounds him as he rolls a joint with the last of his weed on top of a batman comic. he lights the joint and turns on the radio.}
<C>__{radio dj}
<D>__{...3:09 in the pm and we }
<A>__{dale turns off the radio, takes one last haul, and then snubs out the jointerior he then pulls out a small leather kit and sifts through it's contents: handi wipes, hand sanitizer, a little vial of cologne, visine, mouthwash and breath mints. dale vigorously wipes his hands, face, and mouth with wet naps and then starts futilely attempting to put visine in his blazing red eyes. frustrated, he squirts visine all over his finger tips and simply rubs them into his eyes. he uses the mouthwash, chews up a mint, dabs on some cologne, and then gets out of the car.}
<L>__{exterior high school continuous}
<A>__{dale walks towards the school.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{dale!}
<A>__{dale turns to see his attractive 19 year old girlfriend, angie anderson, walking towards him with her group of friends. she kisses him.}

<C>__{angie}
<D>__{of course. but can we just head to my locker first? i left some stuff by mistake.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{sure.}
<L>__{interior high school soon after}
<A>__{dale and angie walk hand in hand towards the locker.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{so, are you going to come over for dinner tomorrow, `cause my parents are beginning to think i made you up.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{well, yeah, i really want to meet them. tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow...let me think.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{you don't have to feel weird about it. they know how old you are and they're fine with it. they just want to meet you and see that you're a cool guy and that i'm not dating you just because you're older.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{of course. i know that. it's just...tomorrow's tight. i've got a whole bunch of cases that i can finish tomorrow. it's probably going to take me into the night.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{fuck. well, then you have to just come over sometime this week or something, okay? `cause it's getting weird for them.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i will. i promise. i'm not trying to avoid this, for real, i've just been crazy busy.}
<C>__{teacher}
<D>__{hello? can i help you?}
<A>__{dale and angie turn to see a teacher, a guy about the same age as dale.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{pardon?}
<C>__{teacher}
<D>__{you can't just waltz in here and hit on the students. get out now before i }
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{mr. edwards, he's my boyfriend.}
<A>__{mr. edwards looks at dale, then shoots angie a confused look.}
<C>__{mr. edwards}
<D>__{this is your boyfriend? how old are you, 30?}
<C>__{dale}
<C>__{mr. edwards}
<D>__{and you're dating an 18 year old?}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{i'm 19. i moved here from morocco.}
<A>__{dale doesn't know what to make of mr. edwards comments and looks.}
<C>__{mr. edwards}
<D>__{alright, well this school is for students and faculty only. friends can't just stop by.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{dude, you may be a teacher here, but we're about the same age, so don't get all high and mighty. it's not that weird. frankly, it's natural.}
<C>__{mr. edwards}
<D>__{well, in that case, get off school property or i'm calling the police liaison officer. angie, no offense to you, but if this guy's dating someone your age, it's because nobody his age will date him.}
<A>__{then, four handsome and fit students walk by.}
<C>__{handsome student}
<D>__{hey angie. you were hilarious in drama today.}
<A>__{angie smiles at the guys. dale doesn't like how all this is going down.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i will wait in the car.}
<L>__{interior dale's car moments later}
<A>__{dale and angie sit in the parked car making out.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{so, do you want to get some food?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no...actually i can't. i have to go serve a guy.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{now?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{yeah. it sucks. i'm sorry. we can hang out later though. you can come over.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{we'll see if neo is truly the one.}
<A>__{they share a long kiss, and angie gets out of the car. dale watches her walk away, then whips out his cell phone and hits speed dial.}
<C>__{saul }
<P>__{(over phone)}
<D>__{yo?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{yo. it's dale. mind if i come by and pick up some shit?}
<L>__{interior saul's apartment later}
<A>__{saul silver is constructing a cross shaped joint (two joints that intersect one another). pot and paraphernalia are scattered all over the coffee table. a large "scarface" movie poster hangs on the wall. there is a knock at the door and dale enters.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{what's up, saul.}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(unpleasantly surprised)}
<D>__{what the fuck?!?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{i didn't buzz you in. how the monkey did you get in here?}

<C>__{saul}
<D>__{that's fucked up, man! this building is filled with fuckin' assholes. what else is the buzzer for? fuck.}
<C>__{dale}

<C>__{saul}
<D>__{hey, stuff your sorry's i n a sack, bro. we're always cool. it's those fuckin' jaggoffs.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{um...sure.}
<A>__{dale awkwardly sits down on the other side of the couch.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{brass tacs. i've got this new bud. unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but fortunately, it's hands down the dopest fuckin' shit i ever smoked. and i've smoked some dope fuckin' shit.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{better than that blue oyster weed?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{dude. seriously. it's like if that blue oyster shit and the afghan kush i got had a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest northern lights and that red ass espresso snowflake had a baby, and then by some miracle those babies met, and fucked then this would be the shit they'd birth.}
<A>__{saul pulls out a big bag of weed. he places it on the coffee table as though it was his child. he pulls out a large bud.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{smell it.}
<A>__{dale takes the weed and looks at it. it looks spectacular. bright red hairs and large crystals, huge purple and blue leaves just spectacular! dale smells it and is taken aback.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{what is this? it's spectacular.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{it's called pineapple express. my guy red told me it's when this hawaiian flood takes special dirt to the weed or some shit. it's pretty scientific. and i'm the only guy in the whole city who has it. and, its only ten bones more for a quarter.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{so...can i get a quarter?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{no doubt. just let me grab my scale.}
<A>__{saul walks into another room. dale looks around anxiously; he clearly wants to go. a moment later, saul comes back into the room and sits down. dale notices that he didn't bring anything back from the other room. saul notices dale looking at him strangely.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{what's with the look? what?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{where's the scale?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{oh shit! the scale. be right back.}
<A>__{saul hustles into the other room.}
<D>__{saul (o.s.) (cont'd)}
<P>__{(from other room)}
<D>__{you know what's weird? how sometimes, your brain just chooses to like, not keep things in it, you know?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{fucking scale.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{shit. where is it?}
<A>__{dale checks his watch and then looks at the door; suddenly, something catches his eye it's the cross joint saul was constructing.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{holy shit! what the fuck is this thing?}
<A>__{saul comes back in and puts a small electronic scale on the coffee table.}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(nonchalantly)}
<D>__{ah, the cross jointerior you've never seen one of these? not surprising. they are, like, the apex of the vortex of joint engineering. nasa built the first one in the eighties.}
<A>__{saul chuckles at his joke as he places some weed on the scale.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{you can actually smoke that contraption?}
<A>__{saul puts dale's weed in a baggie.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{you light all three ends at the same time, then, you smoke it as it resonates the main section, creating a "trifecta" of smoking power. it's like, three times as powerful as a normal jointerior}
<A>__{dale hands saul some money and saul gives him his weed. dale lingers for a moment.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{well, be careful with that thing.}
<A>__{dale gets up and heads to the door.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{dude...you wanna smoke this thing with me?}
<A>__{dale turns around. he clearly wants to smoke it, but he tries to play it cool.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{i can't even light it on my own.}
<A>__{dale sits back down on the couch, giddy as a schoolgirl.}
<C>__{dale}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{wow. so like, uh...so like, so like what do i do?}
<A>__{saul gathers three lighters from the coffee table.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{alright. firstly you light these two ends. then i will light the tip, making the trifecta complete. are you ready?}
<A>__{dale nods and they light the jointerior saul tokes hard; plumes of smoke fill the air as he bursts into a coughing}
<B>__{fit.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{holy...}
<A>__{dale takes the joint and hits it, exploding into a coughing fit.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{it's...uh, it's good to cough. cough it opens the cough capillaries...gets you twenty five percent higher.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{and that, combined with the pineapple weed, and the cross joint cough you're a good thirty to forty times higher. i don't know the exact math, but, pff, you're pretty fucking gong showed. you know what i mean?}
<A>__{saul takes a toke. dale coughs harder and harder. he seems like he might throw up.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{it's crazy. the better the weed, the more i wish i could think of how to explain what's so good about it, but the...uh, the better it is, the less shit i can think of in total, you know?}
<A>__{saul passes dale the joint, obliviously dropping ash all over his suit. slightly agitated, dale brushes it off.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{okay, so, like, you've been buying from me for, like, a few months now and i really gotta ask.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what's with the suit?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i'm a process server.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{you`re a servant? like, a butler.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no, process server.}
<A>__{saul looks confused.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{i'm hired to give people papers they don't want. it's pretty much the easiest job on earth.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{nice, man. where'd you get that job?}
<A>__{dale takes a big hit from the jointerior}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{well...uh, i got a totally useless degree two years ago, then i did nothing for a year, then my dad got so fed up he hooked me up.}
<A>__{they both revel in the thought.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{i got it pretty sweet, though. today? i smoked like five joints, gave out some pieces of paper, and i ate some burger king }
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{hey man, did you get those new chicken fries?}
<A>__{dale passes the join to saul.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{yeah man. i'd get on that shit. they're fucking mind blowing. so, then i hot boxed my car and then...got some action from my girlfriend.}
<A>__{saul laughs at this.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{does she smoke pot?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{a little. she's in high school.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{that's fuckin' sweet! ilegal love! you're like jerry lee lewis. i just read his biography.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no, no. she's 19.}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(dissappointed)}
<D>__{oh. it's still cool i guess.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{yeah, it's awesome, although i think she's getting old enough where she's realizing i don't do much. and these high school guys these days. they're all roided out and going to harvard. even on my best days, i look like a fat, dumb piece of shit next to them.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{whatever, man. it sounds like you got it pretty good. i wish i had a job that easy. fuck.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{dude...you've got, like, the actual easiest job in the world.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{hey! you're right, man. i never thought of it like that.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{you can actually do whatever the hell you want. you get to sleep all day and people come buy weed at night.}
<A>__{dale passes saul the jointerior}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{that's totally true. except tomorrow. thanks to that bitch daylight savings, i gotta go change my grandma's clocks forward at 7am. or 8am. i seriously can't figure it out.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{sorry to hear that.}
<A>__{saul passes dale the jointerior}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{yo, so, like, what have these people done that you go after?}
<C>__{dale}

<C>__{dale }
<D>__{ted jones. he forgot to pay his }
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{dude! my guy, red, gets his weed from a ted jones. he's, like, #1 supplier in town. maybe it's him!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i doubt that, man. there's probably a lot of ted joneses's out there.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{yeah, but not like this one, man! he's what i want to be one day. he's like the "jesus of weed". so...i guess he's like jah. or scarface.}
<A>__{saul points to his scarface poster. the joint ends. after a few moments it seems as though their ability to have a conversation burnt out with the jointerior they sit in awkward silence. dale gets up.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{well saul, that was crazy. thanks.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{no worries dude, peace.}
<A>__{they slap each other five and dale exits. saul turns on the tv. saved by the bell is on. it makes saul chuckle.}
<L>__{interior dale's car night}
<A>__{dale cruises down side streets and locates ted's house. it is a large well to do home. having difficulties, dale parks in between two cars across the street. he turns off the engine and starts smoking a jointerior suddenly flash! two head lights appear up the street. holy shit! it's a cop car! he sits still, holding the joint between his legs as the cop car drives past and...parks a few cars down! the female cop walks up the block towards dale's car!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{oh shit on me.}
<A>__{fortunately, the cop crosses the street and walks towards ted's house. confused, dale watches as she is let in. dale waits a moment and then re lights the jointerior he tries to see into ted's house as he takes a massive toke. bang! a silence shattering blast comes from ted's house. dale holds the toke in and tries to keep quiet as he focuses on the large front window. suddenly, the drapes are torn down by an asian man as he falls forwards and crashes through the front window! dale watches in horror as a large grey haired man and the female cop step forward and shoot the asian man! blam! blam! blood splatters! dale starts coughing uncontrollably! he starts the car and, in a panicked fit, tries to pull out. crash!!! he smashes directly into the car in front of him! he flicks the roach out onto the grass and slams the car in reverse crunch!!! he backs into the car behind him! still hacking his lungs out, dale drives away! the grey haired man and the female cop sprint out of the house in time to see dale's distant tail lights vanish into the darkness. something catches the grey haired man's eye a trail of smoke rising from the grass. he lowers his blood stained hand and picks up...dale's roach! he brings it to his nose and sniffs, then rips open the paper and examines the weed closely.}

<D>__{no. i don't think so. no.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{so...they're not coming here?}
<A>__{dale shakes his head, on the verge of tears. saul shrugs, sits back down, then picks up his joint and re lites it.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{cool. so, what's your game plan? you gonna call the cops? cause if you do, i'd appreciate it if you left my shit out of this shit.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i'm not calling the cops one of them was a cop. they could all be cops!}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{did you see any blood? was it sick?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{yeah. i saw some blood.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{i wonder who the guy he shot was?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i don't know, who do drug dealers kill? it was probably another drug dealer. he was asian. are there asian drug dealers.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{hell yeah, man. the koreans teamed up with, like, the vietnamese or some shit. they're crazy mother fuckers. number two in town.}

<D>__{heh. ted's cappin' the competition. yo, you want some of this?}
<A>__{saul passes dale the jointerior dale takes the joint and frantically smokes as he paces.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{so, like, exactly what was the sequence of happenings?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i'm sitting across from ted's smoking a massive joint of that weed you sold me }
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{oh, the pineapple express. it's so rare it's almost a shame to smoke it, like killing a unicorn...with, like, a bomb.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{when i threw it...out...the window...}
<A>__{dale stops pacing and stares at saul. he then looks down at the joint of pineapple weed. saul notices wheels turning in dale's head.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{dale continues staring at the jointerior}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{this weed is actually that rare?}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{yeah, it's like, "the rarest".}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{so, you are actually the only guy in town with this weed?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{fuckin' rights, i am. red told me he was giving me an "exclusive sneak preview".}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{and am i the only guy you gave it to?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{yeah. so, we're the only guys.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{but, like, another dealer, couldn't identify it, the pineapple weed? like, if they found a roach of it, right?}
<A>__{saul thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{i could. why?}
<C>__{dale}
<P>__{(panicking)}
<D>__{we should go, we shouldn't be here! we should go!}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{no...seriously, why?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i left a roach of this weed in front of ted's house!}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{so what? i leave roaches all over fucking town.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no, listen they could find the roach and say, "this is pineapple weed, saul's the only guy in town who has pineapple weed, therefore he must have witnessed the murder or know who did let's go kill him."}
<A>__{finally, saul understands.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{mother of fuck!}
<A>__{he springs to his feet and bolts for the door.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{dale grabs saul and stops him.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{wait!}

<D>__{why!?! let go of me! let's get the fuck out of here!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{saul, wait! grab anything we might need, like your weed and money and stuff.}
<A>__{saul grabs his bag of weed and shoves it in his backpack. they run for the door.}

<D>__{yes! come on!}
<L>__{interior saul's apartment hallway moments later}

<C>__{saul}
<D>__{fuck! i forgot something!}
<A>__{saul runs back to his apartment, leaving dale alone and frightened. saul bursts back out of his apartment holding his cell.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{dude, i was so scared going back, i thought there was gonna be guys there, and then you'd be gone, and there was this music in my head }
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{we'll take the stairs, it'll be faster.}
<A>__{they scramble towards the distant stairwell. almost at the door, they hear the ding of the elevator arriving.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{go back! go back!}
<A>__{they dash back to the elevator. dale shoves his arm between the doors and they hop in. saul rapidly presses the lobby button as the doors shut. they're both on the verge of hyperventilating.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{okay, man. we gotta try to relax.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{why?!?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{we don't want to draw attention.}

<D>__{what the fuck was that?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{that was bad calm! calm! calm!}

<D>__{let's go to your place.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no way! what if they did see my license plate!?!}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{okay, so let's got to a hotel, or a motel, or a holiday inn.}

<D>__{well, how much money do we have?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{all i've got is the seventy five you gave me.}

<A>__{the car is parked on a small dirt path in the moon lit woods. dale paces back and forth as saul walks over.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{so what do we know? nothing. we may or may not be followed because we don't even know if he found the roach or not. and, we could just be completely crazy. but, the question is this: even if he found the roach, how could he know where you were?}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(thrilled)}
<D>__{he couldn't. cause i'm in the woods. it's impossible! unless he's, like, hanging on the bottom of the car or some shit, but i mean }
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no, what i mean is, if ted found the roach and identified the weed, how could he connect it to you?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{there's no way. he could only find out from red.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{who is this red guy?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{red's pretty much a middleman between ted and guys like me. and we're mad fucking tight. one time he convinced some girl he knew to give me a hand job within, like, five minutes of me meeting her.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{but let's say someone calls asking who he sold this pineapple weed to, he'll say you, because...why wouldn't he?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{fuck that. that's bullshit. he would have called me if that happened. a hand job, dale! imagine if i'd gotten you a hand job by now!}
