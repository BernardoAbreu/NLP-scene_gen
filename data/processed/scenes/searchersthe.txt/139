<A>__{he tilts the jug to his mouth as ethan reaches for his heavy leather pouch. futterman watches greedily as ethan lets a gold piece slide out. he tosses it onto the table.}

<D>__{twenty yankee dollars.}
<A>__{futterman puts the jug down. his hand inches as though pulled by a magnet toward the gold piece.}
<C>__{futterman}
<D>__{...an' a man's time is worth somethin'...}
<A>__{ethan's big hand clamps over futterman's and he starts squeezing as a man would squeeze a lemon. futterman's lips whiten.}

<D>__{a young buck fetched it in late last summer...}
<P>__{(ethan eases the grip)}
<D>__{said it belonged to a captive chile of chief scar...}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{scar? never heard of any chief scar.}
<C>__{futterman}
<D>__{me neither... but this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the nawyecky comanches.}
