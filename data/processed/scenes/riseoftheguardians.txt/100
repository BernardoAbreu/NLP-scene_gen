<A>__{jack runs to the edge of a floating iceberg, ready to throw his tooth box into the ocean. he resists, looking down at the box as he clutches it in his hand. he's never been more alone in his life.}

<D>__{you don't understand anything!}

<D>__{no? i don't know what it's like to be cast out?}
<A>__{pitch strikes back, putting jack on the defense. jack jumps in the air. their show of force escalates until they're shrouded in a blanket of snow, ice, and wind. as the wind and snow settle, jack looks around stern and alert.}

<D>__{what goes together better than cold and dark?}
