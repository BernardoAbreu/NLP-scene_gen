<A>__{as they enter, indiana gives a half dressed dancing girl the once over as she spins to the music of drums and "vinhas".}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i've always had a weakness for folk dancing.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(snidely)}
<D>__{she might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.}
<A>__{they walk among the rich court ministers and indian merchants. chattar lal approaches with a british cavalry captain in unifrom.}
<C>__{chattar lal}
<D>__{we are fortunate tonight to have some many unexpected guests. his is captain phillip blumburtt.}
<A>__{blumburtt bows to willie and indiana.}
<C>__{chattar lal }
<D>__{captain blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".}
<C>__{capt. blumburtt}
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{just a routine inspection tour.}
<C>__{chattar lal}
<D>__{the british worry so about their emprie it makes us feel like well cared for children.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{listen, mr. lal, what do you call the maharajah's wife?}
<C>__{chattar lal}
<D>__{his highness has not yet taken a wife.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(happily)}
<D>__{no? well, i guess he just hasn't met the right woman...}
<A>__{as willie chatters on with the prime minister, indiana wanders off. he moves to a wall where bronze statues and strange devo tional objects are displayed.}
<C>__{capt. blumburtt}
<P>__{(joining indy)}
<D>__{interested in local curios?}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{no. but i am interested in the occult. and this is a krtya.}
<A>__{indiana picks up a small clay figurine and examines it.}
<C>__{capt. blumburtt}
<P>__{(grimacing)}
<D>__{charming.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{it's like the voodoo dolls of west africa. the kryta represents your enemy and gives you complete power over him.}
<C>__{capt. blumburtt}
<D>__{that god all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{you think so?}
<C>__{capt. blumburtt}
<D>__{of course. admittedly, it's taken time. britian's controlled india for almost two hundred eyars now.}
<A>__{indiana smiles at the somewhat pompous bureaucrat.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{you're hanging on better here than you did in america.}
<C>__{capt. blumburtt}
<P>__{(smiling sourly)}
<D>__{this is a different situation, dr. jones. these people are like children. we have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.}
<A>__{indiana puts the doll down and looks over at chattar lal and willie.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{the prime minister doesn't seem that naive.}
<C>__{capt. blumburtt}
<D>__{no, he's a very shrewd old boy. power behind the throne and all that. he actually runs this whole province.}
<A>__{indy and the prime minister exchange distant looks as willie comes back over to indiana. she talks to him conspiratorially }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i think this maharajah is swim ming in money. maybe coming here wasn't such a bad idea.}
<A>__{blumburtt finds these americans quite suspect and seems relieved when he hears a drum.}
<C>__{capt. blumburtt}
<D>__{i believe we're being called to dinner.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{finally!}
<A>__{as the drum beats the assembled guests move toward a long, low table surrounded by colorful pillows. short round follows with a little monkey he's found perched on his arm. as everyone stands around the table, chattar lal makes an an nouncement in hindi and then in english }
<C>__{chattar lal}
<D>__{his supremem highness, guardian of rajput tradition the maharajah of pankot zalim singh.}
<A>__{all eyes are on two solid silver doors which open and through which now walks the maharajah zalim singh. everyone is bowing, including indiana and willie, who looks amazed }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{that's the maharajah that kid?!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{maybe he likes older women.}
<A>__{indeed, zalim singh is only thirteen. outfitted in silver and gold brocade, festooned with enormous jewels, the litlle mahara jah gazes imperiously at the bowing crowd and then glares at short round. indy sees short round chewing gum, staring antagonistically at the maharajah. indy pushes short round into a bowing position. the maharajah finally sits down on golden pillows. he nods and his guests take their seats. indiana sees willie's dreams of queendom have vanished.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i've never been so hungry in my life...}
<A>__{servants appear with silver platters of steaming food. they place a platter in front of willie and she stares at it in amaze ment: it's a whole raosted boar, replete with a decorative arrow pierc ing its bloated stomach and tiny broiled baby bores placed around it as if they were suckling on their well cooked mother.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(grimacing)}
<D>__{my god, sort of grusome, isn't it...?}
<A>__{seeing the meat being served, indiana looks across the table at blumburtt who seems equally puzzled. meanwhile, the little maha rajah whispers to his prime minsiter. then chattar lal speaks to the table }
<C>__{chattar lal}
<D>__{his highness wants me to welcome his visitors. especially the renowned dr. jones from america.}
<A>__{indy bows slightly toward the maharajah.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{we are honored to be here.}
<A>__{servants put down another platter. willie stares at an enormous steaming boa constrictor on the platter. with a flash of a knife, a servant slits the huge snake and exposes a mass of squirming, live baby eels inside...}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{suddenly i'm not so hungry...}
<A>__{meanwhile, indiana is chatting poleitely with the prime minister.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{i had a question, mr. prime mini ster. i was examining some of the maharajah's artifacts.}
<C>__{chattar lal}
<D>__{a very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{yes, very fine. but not all of the pieces look old. some were carved recently and look like images used by the thuggees to worship the god des kali.}
<A>__{at the emntion of the thuggees, the indians at the table quiet, as it a taboo has been broken. chattar lal glares at indiana.}
<C>__{chattar lal}
<D>__{dr. jones, you know very well that the thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.}
<C>__{capt. blumburtt}
<D>__{of course. the thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped kali with human sacrifices. the brit ish army wiped them out about the time of the mutiny of 1857.}
<A>__{short round avoids the dinner by feeding it to his little monkey as he listens to the scary conversation. the talk is bad enough, but willie finds the food unbelievable! a servant leans overher shoulder and places a six inch long bug on her plate! willie whimpers quietly as she watches the fat merchant next to her lift one of the black, shiny baked beetles and crack it in two! the man proceeds to enthusiastically suck the gooey innards out.}
<C>__{merchant}
<P>__{(looking at willie)}
<D>__{but you're not eating!}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{i uh had bugs for lunch.}
<A>__{meanwhile, indiana continues to politely needle chattar lal.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{i suppose stories of the thuggees die hard.}
<C>__{chattar lal}
<D>__{there are no stories anymore.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{well, i don't know... we came here from a small village and the peas ants there told us that the pankot palace was growing powerful again becuase of some ancient evil.}
<A>__{indiana smiles and shrugs.}
<C>__{chattar lal}
<P>__{(sneeringly)}
<D>__{their stories are just fear and folklore.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(cooly)}
<D>__{maybe.. but how do you explain the thuggee shrine i saw right below the palace?}
<A>__{indy catches a glance between the little maharajah and the prime minister, who answers slowly }
<C>__{chattar lal}
<D>__{the local peasants are just as superstitious. you're very ob servant, dr. jones. but you're beginning to worry capt. blum burtt.}
<A>__{blumburtt's phlegmatic attitude has changed to curiosity.}
<C>__{capt. blumburtt}
<D>__{i'm not worried, prime minister, just interested.}
<A>__{during their conversation, willie listens to beetles snapping and she watches revolted as the other dinner guests suck the gooey insides out of the bugs.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(to short round)}
<D>__{give me your hat...}
<C>__{short round}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i'm going to puke in it...}
<A>__{meanwhile, indy continues ingenously with chattar lal.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{you know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.}
<C>__{chattar lal}
<D>__{dr. jones, it our country a guest does not usually insult his host.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{sorry, i thought we were just talking about folklore.}
<C>__{capt. blumburtt}
<P>__{(trying to make peace)}
<D>__{i'm sure it's nothing. just ru mors.}
<P>__{(but interested)}
<D>__{what was it they claimed was stolen?}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{something magical. a sacred rock.}
<C>__{chattar lal}
<P>__{(condescendingly)}
<D>__{there, you see, captain. a rock!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{when they lost this rock their fields and animals dies. they also said their children were taken from them.}
<C>__{chattar lal}
<D>__{i think that's enough of this nonsense, dr. jones...}
<A>__{indiana smiles faintly at chattar lal's anger. across the table, willie looks pale and motions to the waiter.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{so you have something, you know, simple like soup or something?}
<A>__{the servant goes off and returns with a covered bowl. he uncov ers it and willie looks at a soup with a dozen eyeballs floating in it.}
<C>__{merchant}
<D>__{looks delicious!}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i wanna go home...}
<A>__{willie whimpers and tears start down her cheeks.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(to chattar lal)}
<D>__{i was dubious muself at first. then something connected the village's rock and the old legend of the sankara stones...}
<C>__{chattar lal}
<P>__{(controlling himself)}
<D>__{dr. jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. i seem to re member that in honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{the newspapers exaggerated the incident}
<C>__{chattar lal}
<D>__{and didn't the sultan of madagas car threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his coun try?}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{that was a misunderstanding.}
<C>__{chattar lal}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{exactly what we have here, dr. jones.}
<C>__{maharajah}
<D>__{i have heard the terrible stories of the evil thuggee cult...}
<A>__{when the little marahajah speaks it surprises everyone and there is silence.}
<C>__{maharajah }
<D>__{i thought the stories were told to frighten children. later, i learned that the thuggee cult was once real and did unspeakable things.}
<A>__{the marahajah looks at indiana.}
<C>__{maharajah }
<D>__{i am ashamed of what happened here so many years ago. we keep these objects to remind us that this will never again happen in my kingdom!}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{i'm sorry if i've offended you.}
<A>__{now, more trays are whisked in by servants.}
<C>__{merchant}
<D>__{ah, dessert!}
<A>__{short round's monkey suddenly screeches and takes off. willie closed here eyes in dread but curiosity gets the best of her and she looks it's worse than she could imagine: plates full of small, dead monkey heads! (production note: be cause of his extremely sensitive nature, the director has reque ted that these monkey heads be simulated). the tops of the monkey's skulls have been cut off and sit loose like little covers. willie watches in utter dismay as the maha rajah and his guests remove the skull tops and start dipping spoons into what's inside }
<C>__{merchant }
<D>__{chilled monkey brains!}
<A>__{willie keels over, crashing backwards in a dead faint!}
