<LOC>__{EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON}
<ACTION>__{A COUPLE moves down a walkway, deep in subdued conversation. All around them trees explode with autumn color. Birds sing. Their path is dappled with leafy shadow. To their left, on the sunny meadow, TEENAGERS throw saucers and footballs, smoke cigarettes and joints, drink beer and soda, savoring the waning hours of summer.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{CLOSER ON THE COUPLE}
<ACTION>__{He is WILLS KEANE, late 40's to early 50's, strikingly handsome, impeccably dressed, and supremely poised. At first glance he has the proud glow of a hedonist who in the war against time has been the undisputed victor. Only a closer look hints at the toll of battle. His shoulders strain under the weight of so much repetition. His eyes are touched by regret. The lines in his face reveal an emerging disenchantment not so much with the world as with himself. Walking at his side is a WOMAN, 30, attractive and bright. Her name is unimportant because so many have come before her and, if the past prevails, so many will come after. She listens intently, as Wills finishes speaking --}
<CHAR>__{WILLS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{-- and I could have waited to tell you, but I wanted to leave no room for misunderstanding.}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, you certainly didn't.}

<CHAR>__{WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, I see how you could feel this way. Of course I do. It's human. But what I don't get is why you'd want to announce it so quickly. I mean, we just met. Feelings change. You don't even know me.}
<CHAR>__{WILLS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, I do.}
<ACTION>__{She is amused by his confidence --}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, really?}
<CHAR>__{WILLS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The minute I laid eyes on you. It's the saddest thing about getting older. You know people so quickly. I even knew you'd end up hating me.}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, you're wrong. I don't.}
<CHAR>__{WILLS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(with a weary smile)}
<DIAL>__{Give it time.}
<ACTION>__{She laughs. Then he stops. He hears something. She stops. She hears it, too. It's a GIRL'S VOICE. He casually turns and looks, squinting into the sun. He takes a few steps and there, between trees, he sees TWO DOZEN PEOPLE sitting on the grass and on folding chairs -- most are middle-aged or older with a distinctly intellectual- bohemian look to them. Standing and addressing them is CHARLOTTE FIELDING, 19, fair, willowy, pale, lovely in an unconventional way. She wears an eccentric hat and a vintage dress. Her bearing is upright, her gaze warm and intelligent, her voice rich with emotion --}
<CHAR>__{CHARLOTTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{-- and for weeks I sat by her bed and cried. I told her I loved her and I begged her not to leave me. All I could think about was what I'd lose if she died. And then one night... she was in really bad pain... I stopped thinking about myself for a second and I thought about her.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(fighting tears)}
<DIAL>__{I stopped crying. I said goodbye. And in less than an hour Ella was gone.}
<ACTION>__{The woman whispers in Wills' ear --}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's so sad.}
<ACTION>__{But Wills ignores her. He watches Charlotte with keen interest, touched by the depth and sincerity of her emotion.}
<CHAR>__{CHARLOTTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I really think it's possible to hold a person back... cry them back... from dying. That's what I did to Ella and I'll never do it to anyone else again.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(softly)}
<DIAL>__{I hope no one ever does it to me.}
<ACTION>__{She looks out at the group, many of whom are crying. A tear runs down her cheek. She smiles and wipes it away. The woman, seeing Wills' interest in the girl, whispers --}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So what do you know about her?}
<ACTION>__{He knows a great deal. Or at least he thinks he does. But his answer is nonchalant --}
<CHAR>__{WILLS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That she's just a kid.}
<ACTION>__{He takes the woman gently by the elbow and guides her away. He steals one last look back. Charlotte, returning to where she was sitting, notices Wills. Their eyes meet and a charge passes between them. Meanwhile an OLD MAN has risen from his chair --}

<ACTION>__{From amid the RUSH OF TRAFFIC, a TAXI breaks free and glides to the curb in front of the RESTAURANT. Its facade is windowless.

<ACTION>__{Eriko nods and follows Celia. Wills moves to the reservation stand where his best friend and the restaurant's manager, JOHN VOLPE, 40, a brilliant, dapper, tough as nails Brooklynite stands, listening to someone on the telephone.

<DIAL>__{We wisely agreed to cut our losses.}
<ACTION>__{Wills exits into the bar. John smiles and shakes his head. FOLLOW WILLS, as he glides along the bar. CUSTOMERS and STAFF greet him warmly. As he enters the main dining room, DINERS spot him -- sprinkled among them are CELEBRITIES from every walk of city life. Wills greets them, stopping to shake their hands and kiss their cheeks. Suddenly, Celia, the hostess, red-faced, blocks his path --}
<CHAR>__{CELIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look, I have no right to say this, okay? And you can fire me if you want, but in the six weeks we've been open you've brought in six different women -- tonight makes seven -- and it's really starting to get to me.}
<CHAR>__{WILLS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{In what way?}
<CHAR>__{CELIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I have to greet them! It's like working at a dog shelter! I'm afraid to learn their names or even smile at them because I know any minute they could be put down!}
<CHAR>__{WILLS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I assure you it's an absolutely painless procedure.}

<DIAL>__{It is?}
<CHAR>__{WILLS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat)}
<DIAL>__{Especially for me.}
<ACTION>__{They both laugh. He moves closer, lowers his voice, and speaks with warm sincerity --}
<CHAR>__{WILLS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Actually, I appreciate your concern, Celia. The truth is I'm a little worried myself.}
<CHAR>__{CELIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Seriously?}
<CHAR>__{WILLS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Seriously. I've been trying to do better.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(uneasily)}
<DIAL>__{But... you know how it is... old habits die hard.}
<CHAR>__{CELIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So I'm not fired?}
<CHAR>__{WILLS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nope. In fact, John's been looking for an assistant. Tell him you've just been promoted.}
<ACTION>__{Wills smiles, pats her in the shoulder, and moves on. She can't believe it. A WAITER carrying a BIRTHDAY CAKE -- blazing with candles and decorated with a WOMAN'S HAT made of MERINGUE LATTICEWORK -- passes by on his way to the REAR DINING ROOM. From inside, VOICES begin to sing HAPPY BIRTHDAY. Wills, his curiosity piqued, follows.}
<LOC>__{INT. REAR DINING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS}
<ACTION>__{The waiter sets down the cake at the center of a round table. There's a CHEER and APPLAUSE as the song ends. Wills cannot see whose birthday it is because the waiter blocks his view. Just as Wills is about to exit the room, the waiter steps away. Wills glances over and sees the birthday girl. At first he can't place her, but then he does, and his face softens and brightens. It's Charlotte. She wears a black velvet dress and a wonderfully eccentric hat. Her eyes glow in the candlelight. Through the chorus of voices, urging her to make a wish, she cries out --}

<DIAL>__{You guys! Let me think!}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(concentrating)}
<DIAL>__{Okay. Okay.}
<ACTION>__{Charlotte blows hard, and, with a little more effort than you might expect, extinguishes the candles. Everyone APPLAUDS and CHEERS. To Charlotte's right sits SIMON LORING, late 20's, English, sardonic, adoring. He gestures at her CHEST and says --}
<CHAR>__{SIMON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Watch carefully, everyone -- they ought to begin emerging any moment now.}
<ACTION>__{Everyone laughs. Charlotte playfully slaps him --}
<CHAR>__{CHARLOTTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<ACTION>__{More laughter. BACK TO WILLS. He considers approaching Charlotte, but then he looks back and sees Eriko sitting alone at their table, idly stabbing at her drink with a straw. Regretting his rudeness, he takes a step toward her, but then hears --}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is that Wills Keane?}
<ACTION>__{He turns and sees DOLORES TALBOT, 70, blonde wig, spindly frame, weathered skin, large, sad eyes. She holds a mixed drink --}

He speaks to the first person he sees -- a ROTUND FEMALE LIBRARIAN IN HER 60'S. He stops and asks a question about Lisa. She nods. Wills is shaken by the answer. He stares into the middle distance, wondering what to do, his mind racing. The librarian, a little nervous now, reminds him that he is not allowed in the library. He snaps to, thanks her, and moves away. But then he stops, takes out a BUSINESS CARD, and returns to the librarian. He is about to hand it to her, but then he thinks better of it.
