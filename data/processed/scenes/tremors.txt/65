<A>__{val and earl are well ahead of the other townsfolk as they march around to the side of pham van's. but where's melvin? nothing out here but the oppressive, hot desert silence. then they hear a soft shuddering whimper from above. there's terrified melvin, halfway up a telephone pole, clinging to it desperately. val and earl freeze in their tracks and glance at each other, realizing instantly what's up. without a word they leap desperately in opposite directions. like a breaching whale, a creature roars up through the earth right where they were standing, great mouth gaping open, slimy tentacles lashing in all directions. the townsfolk scatter, some heading for their homes, including viola and nestor. others scramble over each other as they pile back into pham van's. the telephone pole shudders. melvin falls and scampers for the nearest hiding place, a corrugated tin storage shed near pham van's.}
