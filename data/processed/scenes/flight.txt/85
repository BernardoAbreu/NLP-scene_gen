<L>__{exterior crash site day}
<A>__{a reporter gives a lead in at the crash site.}
<D>__{crash site reporter #1 kevin, it's still chaotic here at the site. apparently a small ministry was conducting services near to where the plane came down. so the scene here is a mix of survivors and first responders, i was able to catch up with an actual passenger moments ago...}
<B>__{a young short haired blonde man gives his account}
<C>__{passenger 1}
<D>__{we were in a nose dive and people were screaming and yelling and then the plane turned upside down and we had to hold on to our seat belts to keep from falling out of our chairs i saw one kid fall to the floor and this flight attendant picked him up and handed him to his dad...i didn't see her again. crash site reporter #1 more details and more reports of the casualties are continuing to fly around. i can tell you that there appears to be many, many survivors. that's all i have for now. kevin?}
<A>__{another reporter has a passenger's account.}
<D>__{crash site reporter #2 rebecca, surviving passengers are being put in ambulances, police cruisers and even first responder vehicles and they are being taken to local hospitals for treatment. some of the injured appear serious and it's safe to assume at this point that there are at least a few fatalities. let's roll the tape of the passenger i caught up with earlier.}
<A>__{a man with short dark hair explains his experience.}
<C>__{passenger 2}
<D>__{we turned like a corkscrew and all i could think was, "this is really happening, i'm going to die" and then all of a sudden the plane was upside down but steady and the pilot must have known how to fly it that way. he flipped it back over and landed it hard. crash site reporter #2 obviously a harrowing ordeal for those on the troubled plane. this is callie j kenner for news 5.}
<A>__{a third reporter gets a female neighbor's perspective.}
<D>__{crash site reporter #3 folks in the houses that border this field came running from their houses...}
<C>__{neighbor}
<D>__{i thought it was thunder at first. but it shook the ground hard. thunder don't do like that. i ran outside and i could hear people yelling and i could see a small fire at first. i just took the dogs and headed down there. then i saw the plane crumpled on the ground. i never seen nothing like that in my life. crash site reporter #3 just like that plane, this community is shattered. folks here remain on edge as media trucks continue to line their small road and crowd the field where the plane still lies. back to you, tom.}
