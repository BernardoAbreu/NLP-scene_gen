<L>__{interior dobisch's office day}
<A>__{it is a glass enclosed cubicle on the twenty first floor. through the glass we see another enormous layout of desks, everybody working away. dobisch is holding the phone in one hand, running an electric shaver over his face with the other.}
<C>__{dobisch}
<D>__{oh, buddy boy. i was just about to call you.}
<P>__{(shuts off electric shaver)}
<D>__{i'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. you see, my little friend, she kept insisting picasso was a bum so she started to do that mural but i'm sure it will wash off just eyebrow pencil.}
<A>__{bud on phone}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{it's not picasso i'm calling about. it's the key to my apartment you were supposed to leave it under the mat.}
<A>__{dobisch on phone}
<C>__{dobisch}
<D>__{i did, didn't i? i distinctly remember bending over and putting it there }
<A>__{bud on phone}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{oh, i found a key there, all right only it's the wrong key.}
<A>__{dobisch on phone}
<C>__{dobisch}
<D>__{it is?}
<P>__{(takes bud's key out of his pocket)}
<D>__{well, how about that? no wonder i couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.}
<A>__{bud on phone}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{and i couldn't get into my apartment so at four a. m. i had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.}
<A>__{dobisch on phone}
<C>__{dobisch}
<D>__{that's a shame. i will send the key right down. and about your promotion }
<P>__{(leafs through report on desk)}
<D>__{ i'm sending that efficiency report right up to mr. sheldrake, in personnel. i wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.}
<A>__{bud on phone}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{thank you, mr. dobisch.}
<A>__{he hangs up, feels his forehead. it is warm. clipped to his handkerchief pocket are a black fountain pen and, next to it, a thermometer in a black case. bud unclips the thermometer case, unscrews the cap, shakes the thermometer out, puts it under his tongue. he resumes work. a messenger comes up to his desk with an interoffice envelope.}
<C>__{messenger}
<D>__{from mr. dobisch.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(thermometer in mouth)}
<D>__{wait.}
<A>__{he turns away from the messenger, unties the string of the envelope, takes his key out, puts it in a coat pocket. from a trouser pocket, he extracts dobisch's key to the executive washroom, slips it discreetly into the envelope, reties it, hands it to the messenger.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(thermometer in mouth)}
<D>__{to mr. dobisch.}
<A>__{puzzled by the whole procedure, the messenger leaves. bud now removes the thermometer from his mouth, reads it. it's worse than he thought. he puts the thermometer back in the case, clips it to his pocket, takes his desk calendar out of a drawer, turns a leaf. under the date wednesday, november 4 there is an entry in his handwriting mr. vanderhof. bud consults the telephone directory again, picks up the phone, dials.}
