<A>__{a laser bolt explodes near the princess. everyone turns to see what threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad of stormtroopers running toward them. artoo peeks out from the elevator. leia and chewbacca start firing at the troopers as lando makes a break for the elevator. laser bolts continue to explode around the princess and the wookiee, but they refuse to budge. lando sticks his head out of the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely notice. they seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of captivity and anger of loss pour through their death dealing weapons. but after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser fire toward the elevator. once they are inside, the door slams shut and the stormtroopers race forward.}
