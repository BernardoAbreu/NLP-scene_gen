<L>__{interior campbell center conference room day}
<A>__{a small tv screen shows footage of anne drowning in the cell. catherine, cooperman, henry, and miriam watch with curiosity, disgust, pity. novak and ramsey flank the portable monitor vcr, knowing this is a disturbing but powerful tool. there's someone else in the room. john tracy. he cannot watch the video, not again. catherine glances at him, uncomfortable with his presence.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{when did he lapse into the coma?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{sometime yesterday morning.}
<A>__{john tries to keep his composure, but novak's making this tough for him. novak wants the scientists to see, to understand the boy's pain.}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{each tape is the same. he provides food, drinking water, a toilet. periodically, a shower starts. it's on some kind of timer he's clever with machines, building things. i think he wants them to believe this is a simple kidnapping. that there's a possibility of rescue. of survival. but it's just a form of torture. at the end of the fortieth hour, the drain shuts. the water starts and doesn't stop.}
<P>__{(gravely)}
<D>__{we've already lost more than a day. if she isn't found tonight. she dies like the rest.}
<C>__{cooperman}
<P>__{(to miriam, henry and catherine)}
<D>__{john and ella baines as well as the sunerset board of directors have given their approval, but the decision is yours.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{what about the legalities of this...?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{stargher is in custody. the functional equivalent of being under arrest. normally, we'd mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. but because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{so what you're asking us to do is illegal?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{no, not at all.}
<P>__{(explains)}
<D>__{we're dealing with exigent circumstances. somewhere there's a kidnapped woman still alive. if we weigh the suspect's constitutional rights against the public safety. the law favors the victim and gives us a lot of leeway. it's called the public safety exception.}
<C>__{cooperman}
<D>__{so what can you do?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{pretty much anything we want. there's a chance to save a human life. because of that, stargher has no reasonable expectation of privacy.}
<A>__{miriam, henry and cooperman appear to be onboard. novak's made a persuasive, heartfelt argument. only one person still remains uncertain.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{what if...?}
<A>__{all eyes turn to her.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{what if he wasn't like this? what if he was "normal?" conscious. how far would you go?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{as far as i needed.}
<A>__{catherine nods, analyzes novak's eyes, gestures, body language, and "interrogates" him.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{do you think he'd tell you what you need to know?}
<A>__{john's discomfort is increasing and novak is sensitive to it.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{there's always a chance they'll confess.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{really? i don't work with violent cases, i work with children. but even a kid lies. they love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true. don't you think stargher would do the same?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{sometimes... once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure. they have so much they want to tell. but they've never had a sympathetic ear. they need someone to understand why.}
<P>__{(focusing on catherine)}
<D>__{stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully. it was part of the ritual. some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean. but these last three... they were still in water always in water but}
<P>__{(clarifies)}
<D>__{listen, he wasn't just careless. it went beyond that...}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{okay. let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... most likely, that part is dead. schizophrenics with whalen's infraction sever all ties with the real world. i'm sorry, i really am.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{is it possible?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{if he came to trust me, yes, but it takes months to build that kind of trust. someone like stargher can't distinguish between fantasy and reality. it's all the same. he might tell me she's in timbuktu and absolutely, one hundred percent believe it to be true, but she's...}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{julia.}
<A>__{they turn to john tracy. his vulnerable, barely audible voice forcing everyone to listen.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{not "she." julia. not thing, or it, or her. do you know anything about her? do you know what we've been through? julia is everything to me. can you say that about anyone?}
<A>__{catherine hangs her head. and finds herself looking at photograph of the girl in question. a smiling julia hickson looking right at her. whoop whoop whoop whoop. pounding reverberations...}
