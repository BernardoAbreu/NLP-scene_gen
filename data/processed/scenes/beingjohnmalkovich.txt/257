<L>__{interior craig and maxine's office night}
<A>__{maxine and malkovich are furiously filling the portal with cement. suddenly malkovich stops and runs to the office door screaming a bloodcurdling scream. he stops just as suddenly, begins to strangle himself.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<P>__{(craig to malkovich)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<P>__{(to maxine)}
<D>__{sorry, dear, i lost control for a minute.}
<C>__{maxine}
<P>__{(kissing him)}
<D>__{it's okay, my sweet.}
<A>__{they go back to filling the portal. there is the sound of many shuffling feet in the hallway. the door flies open and the malkovichians led by lester and lotte burst in. malkovich and maxine turn with a start.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{aaaahhhh, the portal!}
<C>__{lotte}
<P>__{(to malkovich)}
<D>__{you bastard!}
<A>__{lotte lunges for malkovich. lester grabs her arm, holds her back.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{no! don't harm the vessel!}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{it's craig in there, i can tell.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.}
<P>__{(to malkovich)}
<D>__{please, craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{squatter's rights, lester.}
<A>__{craig laughs somewhat maniacally. maxine slips her arm through craig's, joins him in his laughter, and glances triumphantly over at lotte.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{now excuse us, we have an entertainment legend to create.}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(to the cult members)}
<D>__{clear the way for them, my friends. they will be dealt with in due time.}
<A>__{the malkovichians grumble and let malkovich and maxine exit.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{now, let's see what we can do to salvage this portal... for the sake of all that is good.}
<A>__{the malkovichians converge on the sealed portal, and begin clawing desperately at the quick drying cement. fingers are scraped raw, and we see smears of blood and skin on the rough gray surface.}
