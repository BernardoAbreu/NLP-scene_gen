<L>__{interior hotel suite day}
<A>__{danny looks at a diagram of the safe they'll have to crack when they get inside vanderspeigle's house, the safe that contains the "vanderspeigle getuigschrift". everyone but linus and rusty are here. but then rusty comes in.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{you're not going to believe this.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{try me.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{we don't have line of sight.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{we tried everywhere. some places we're only three or four inches off...but...there's no straight shot. even with basher. it's literally impossible.}
<A>__{linus enters, out of breath. seeing everyone, he goes to danny and rusty.}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{can i talk to you guys for a second?}
<A>__{they nod and allow linus to pull them into the corner. linus looks over at the group and then turns to 'them.}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{listen, i've done a little research on the schuman special, and uh...we don't have line of sight for the shot.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{jesus. this'll kill us.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(to linus)}
<D>__{listen: don't say anything. if you're ever going to run your own crew, you've got to remember to never show weakness.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{it's like blood in the water for these guys.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{if they think you're slipping, you won't even see it coming.}
<A>__{linus swallows.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{but hey thanks.}
<A>__{linus nods and goes back to the group.}
<C>__{rusty}
<P>__{(to danny)}
<D>__{i need some air.}
