<A>__{what you have just read is a reproduction of the "1st draft" for the feature film "flash gordon". the original source material came from a badly deteriorated copy of the original script and in some instances dialogue which could not be read was guessed upon by best case understanding. we have made every attempt to include the integrity of the original script, "as is", to include all original descriptions, grammar and spelling. errors as well. we hope you've enjoyed this original look at "flash gordon"!}
