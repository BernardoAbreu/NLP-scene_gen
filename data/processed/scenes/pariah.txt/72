<L>__{interior bina's bedroom morning}
<A>__{alike is asleep on the bed. bina cleans up feverishly, "accidentally" bumping alike awake. alike yawns and rolls over, a huge grin spreading across her face as she remembers her surroundings.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{bina bolts to the dresser and crams clothes in.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{you up already?}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{it's after one o'clock, actually.}
<A>__{bina deposits an armful of clothes into the dirty clothes hamper, and then begins making the bed with alike still in it. alike pulls bina down beside her.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{nothin's wrong, i'm just cleaning up. don't worry about it.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{okay then, i will help you.}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{no, i got it.}
<A>__{bina snatches a pillow from behind alike and fluffs it. alike, still oblivious, grins and traces bina's shoulder.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{look um i just wanted to say that last night...last night was amazing...thank you for }
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{last night we were just playin' around, that's all.}
<A>__{bina flinches away from alike's touch. alike shoots a glance at the door and drops her voice to a choked whisper.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{look... we can slow things down... nobody has to know that we're together.}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{"together"? whoa, no...}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{huh?! i thought... look if you don't want to call it that, that's fine, but don't act like nothing happened.}
<A>__{bina moves away and levels her gaze at alike for the first time. alike touches bina's elbow, bina flinches away.}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{look, i'm not gay okay? this isn't me i wasn't i'm not ready for all this...}
<A>__{alike recruits the discarded stuffed moose and dances it around on the bed. bina recoils and snatches it away. recognition seeps across alike's pained face. bina moves away from the bed and turns her back on alike. alike finds her pajama pants on the floor and yanks them on. she pulls on jeans over her pajama bottoms and hauls a sweatshirt down over her nightie. she flings her backpack open on the bed and hunts around the room wildly gathering her things. alike goes in the bathroom and reappears with an armful of toiletries, dumping them in the bag. bina watches her, arms folded. alike takes one last look around the room and heads for the door, running a sleeve across her face.}
<C>__{bina }
<D>__{lee?}
<A>__{alike ignores her and launches into the hallway. bina runs to her bedroom doorway.}
<C>__{bina }
<D>__{wait lee?!}
<A>__{alike beelines for the front door. bina chases alike across the room.}
<C>__{bina }
<D>__{lee, stop please?}
<A>__{alike wipes a sleeve across her swelling eyes and running nose and turns to face her. bina takes several steps toward her. alike lets go of the doorhandle, her voice cracks.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bina}
<D>__{you promise you won't tell anybody?}
