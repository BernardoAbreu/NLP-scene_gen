<D>__{a summer's day. anna, helen and uncle stepan are preparing to eat sunday lunch. stepan is carving. the conversation is jovial as anna and helen bring dishes of food to the table. then we hear a baby crying. anna goes to a small crib and lifts a six month old christine out. she hands her to helen who hugs her. over this happy scene we hear tatiana in v.o., a repeat of the first words we heard her say.}
