<L>__{exterior beach night}
<A>__{camera, facing the ocean, moves along the shore revealing a lone image sitting on the beach, looking into the atlantic. the waves are small bur rhythmic, an enternal metronome. numb, alex browning sits in the sand searching for an answer somewhere in the darkness of the evening sea. behind him, o.s., approaching in the sand, soft footsteps. he listens, notes them. yet rather than turn around... he looks up into the sky. alex's pov the sky the shoreline lights cast an orange haze on the stars, breaking through, infinitely above.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{are they up there?}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{clear rivers approaches, barefoot in the sand. he neddn't turn to know who is behind him.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{somehow... is 180 still in flight? somewhere... are they still safe?}
<A>__{clear hasn't met eyes with alex, but she sits nearby, looking into the sky.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{when i was a kid, like, six or seven... i used to worry so much about my parents dying. like lying awake at night... just worrying. i loved them so much. i didn't want them to get hurt. and what would happen to me? what would life be like?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{every night... it seemed.}
<A>__{she looks out at the stars. he doesn't eye her, either...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{most kids do, i guess.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{most kids never have it happen.}
<A>__{alex hangs his head...}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{when i was ten... my dad went into a 7 11 for cigerettes. i guess he heard somebody say "don't turn around." so on reflex, or thinkin' a friend was jokin'... he did. and the guy blew his head off.}
<A>__{she has lived this so many times, she is long beyond crying...}
<C>__{clear }
<D>__{and, let me tell ya, i had every reason to worry before... because life became shit. i don't blame her, i guess, but my mom couldn't deal with it at all. she married this asshole, who my mom with my real dad would cross the street to avoid this guy. he really didn't want a kid. and so my mom didn't either anymore, i guess.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if that was the design for my father... and my family... then fuck death, fuck it!}
<A>__{the waves continue to shore. clear looks up at the sky.}
<C>__{clear }
<D>__{and so, anyway... i've thought of that "somewhere," alex. it exists, that place.}
<A>__{he looks at her.}
<C>__{clear }
<D>__{where my dad is still safe. where he had a full pack of cigerettes and kept driving. a place where me and my dad and my mom... are still together....and have no idea about this second life, here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a place where our friends are still in the sky... where everyone gets a second chance.}
<A>__{she looks at him...}
<C>__{clear }
<D>__{but that place might only exist in my heart. and maybe, now... yours. i haven't experienced too many second chances in my life. i haven't seen any. but because of all of this, i believe... because of you... i will get a second chance. because of me, you will. with you in my life... that place, right now existing in our hearts, will spring out... and become a real part of this life.}
<A>__{alex looks within her, as a soft ocean breeze blows through clear's hair.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{and that is the only way we can beat death... by making something special out of life.}
<A>__{his eyes well with tears. only as she looks at alex does clear become emotional... they move closer, and kiss, the desire for each other, to defy the events around them; darkness; the isolation... they dive into a deep feverish kiss. embracing, as if the tighter, the safer. she pulls him back down to the beach and lifts his shirt over his head.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{this won't be safe.}
<A>__{clear looks down the beach, checking for any sight of billy and carter.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{no.. i mean, i don't have anything on me. this won't be safe.}
<C>__{clear}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{nothing is... anymore.}
<A>__{alex looks to clear, then kisses her with passion that reflects the defiance of death. he pulls open her shirt and falls into her arms. camera cranes up as the young man and woman make love in the sand... consciously and defiantly oblivious, to anything around them... including the stars, possibly flight 180, up above.}
