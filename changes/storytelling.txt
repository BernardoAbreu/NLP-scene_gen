<DIAL>__{Hey, you want to hear my short story now?}

<DIAL>__{Huh?}
<CHAR>__{MARCUS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(lifts a MS from a shelf by his bed)}
<DIAL>__{I can read it to you.}
<CHAR>__{VI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You mean, again?}
<CHAR>__{MARCUS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, I changed the ending a little.}
<CHAR>__{VI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh. What happens now?}
<CHAR>__{MARCUS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.}
<CHAR>__{VI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.}
<CHAR>__{MARCUS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.}
<CHAR>__{VI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.}
<ACTION>__{Pause.}
<CHAR>__{MARCUS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So you don't want to hear my new ending?}
<CHAR>__{VI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat)}
<DIAL>__{Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.}
<ACTION>__{She rises, starts dressing.}
<CHAR>__{MARCUS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're tired of me. I can tell.}
<CHAR>__{VI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.}
<CHAR>__{MARCUS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.}
<CHAR>__{VI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I was never much of a sweater. You know that.}
<CHAR>__{MARCUS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind.}

<ACTION>__{It is bright and sunny.}
<LOC>__{INT. MR SCOTT'S CLASSROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Mr Scott, who is black, presides over his class. Marcus is reading from his story, Vi at his side. Catherine, a stunning intellectual, sits near the teacher. The rest of the students (Amy, Elli, etc.) listen closely and take notes.}
<CHAR>__{MARCUS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{"...but when he saw her...it was as if he could walk like a normal person. His legs didn't swing, his arms didn't spaz away...He wasn't a freak any more, for she made him forget his affliction. No more cerebral palsy! From now on  "CP" stood for...cerebral person. He was a cerebral person.}
<ACTION>__{Pause. Marcus and Vi exchange looks.}
<CHAR>__{AMY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I thought it was really good, Marcus...Really moving and emotional.}
<CHAR>__{ELLI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, I thought it was really emotional, too.}
<CHAR>__{AMY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And I mean, really good word choices. It kind of reminded me a little of Faulkner, but East Coast and disabled.}
<CHAR>__{LUCY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Or Flannery O'Connor. She had multiple sclerosis.}
<CHAR>__{JOYCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And Borges. He was blind.}

<DIAL>__{Updike has psoriasis.}
<ACTION>__{Pause.}
<CHAR>__{CATHERINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Um...Maybe I'm wrong, but, um, I'm afraid I found the whole thing to be a little trite. Its earnestness is, well...it's a little embarrassing. And those adjectives, they're a little flatfooted. And redundant. I'm sorry, but...Anyway, what do I know? Don't even listen to what I say. I mean...}
<ACTION>__{Pause.}
<CHAR>__{MR SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Anyone else?}
<ACTION>__{No response.}
<CHAR>__{MR SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Catherine is right. The story's a piece of shit. You express nothing but banalities and, formally speaking, are unable to construct a single compelling sentence. You ride on a wave of cliches so worn, in fact, it actually approaches a level of grotesquerie. Ad your subtitle, 'the rawness of truth' is that supposed to be a joke of some sort? Or are you just being pretentious?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat; then checking his class book)}
<DIAL>__{OK. Who's next?}

<CHAR>__{VI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Marcus...You'll write something better next time!}
<CHAR>__{MARCUS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!}
<CHAR>__{VI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like     that bitch Catherine.}
<CHAR>__{MARCUS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.}
<CHAR>__{VI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.}
<ACTION>__{Catherine and Mr Scott walk by together in the distance.}
<CHAR>__{MARCUS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{MELINDA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You did the right thing.}
<CHAR>__{VI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know that. Fucking cripple. Why do I waste my time with undergrads? They're all so...juvenile! Uch! I just thought Marcus would be different. I mean he's got CP!}

<DIAL>__{What are you gonna do now?}
<CHAR>__{VI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{Well, now you have.}
<ACTION>__{Vi laughs, sort of, ten blushes.}
<CHAR>__{VI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{MR SCOTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Uh huh.}
<CHAR>__{VI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can I join you?}

<DIAL>__{Gee, thanks. Well, um...I just wanted to say that I'm really happy with the class and, um...I know you must here this all the time, but I'm also a great admirer of your work. A Sunday Lynching, especially...really, um spoke to me. God, I hope I'm not embarrassing you...}

<DIAL>__{You're not.}
<CHAR>__{VI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good.}

<DIAL>__{That's good.}

''Say, 'Fuck me, nigger. Fuck me hard.''' John's flesh abraded her soft skin. There would be marks. She acquiesced, and said what he asked her to say, and did what he asked her to do.

<CHAR>__{JOYCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, well, it did seem a little affected. Like by using taboo language you were trying to shock us about the hollowness of your characters.}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think it was a little bit racist.}
<CHAR>__{ELLI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It was completely racist, and beyond that I felt deeply offended as a     woman. As if a woman can only operate from experiences of objectification.}

<CHAR>__{CATHERINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat)}
<DIAL>__{It was confessional, yet dishonest. Jane pretends to be horrified by     the sexuality that she in fact fetishizes. She subsumes herself to the myth of black male potency, but then doesn't follow through. She thinks she 'respects Afro-Americans,' she thinks they're 'cool,' 'exotic,' what a notch he 'd make in her belt, but, of course, it all comes down to mandingo cliche, and he calls her on it. In classic racist tradition she demonizes, then runs for cover. But then, how could she behave otherwise? She's just a spoiled suburban white girl with a Benneton rainbow complex. It's just my opinion, and what do I know...but I think it's a callow piece of writing.}
