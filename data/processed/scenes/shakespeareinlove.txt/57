<L>__{exterior the river. viola's boat. night.}
<A>__{will turns back to viola. they have their conversation intimately, disregarding the lack of intimacy. the boatman is hardly an arm's length away, but they ignore him.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{she tells me to keep away. she is to marry lord wessex. what should i do?}
<C>__{viola as thomas}
<D>__{if you love her, you must do what she asks.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{and break her heart and mine?}
<C>__{viola as thomas}
<D>__{it is only ours you can know.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{she loves me, thomas!}
<C>__{viola as thomas}
<D>__{does she say so?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no. and yet she does where the ink has run with tears. was she weeping when she gave you this?}
<C>__{viola as thomas}
<D>__{i ... her letter came to me by the nurse.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{your aunt?}
<C>__{viola as thomas}
<P>__{(catching up)}
<D>__{yes, my aunt. but perhaps she wept a little. tell me how you love her, will.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{like a sickness and its cure together.}
<C>__{viola as thomas}
<D>__{yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.}
<P>__{(collecting herself)}
<D>__{is your lady beautiful? since i came to visit from the country, i have not seen her close. tell me, is she beautiful?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{oh, if i could write the beauty of her eyes! i was born to look in them and know myself.}
<A>__{he is looking into viola's eyes. she holds his look, but will belies his words.}
<C>__{viola as thomas}
<D>__{and her lips?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{oh, thomas, her lips! the early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!}
<C>__{viola as thomas}
<D>__{and her voice? like lark song?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{deeper. softer. none of your twittering larks! i would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.}
<C>__{viola as thomas}
<D>__{she sings too?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{constantly. without doubt. and plays the lute, she has a natural ear. and her bosom did i mention her bosom?}
<C>__{viola as thomas}
<P>__{(glinting)}
<D>__{what of her bosom?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{oh thomas, a pair of pippins! as round and rare as golden apples!}
<C>__{viola as thomas}
<D>__{i think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. for what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a bankside poet and player?}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(fervently)}
<D>__{yes, by god! love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! it will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to god! so tell my lady, william shakespeare waits for her in the garden!}
<C>__{viola as thomas}
<D>__{but what of lord wessex?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{for one kiss, i would defy a thousand wessexes!}
<A>__{the boat scrapes on the jetty of the de lessepses' house. the bump throws thomas into will's arms. he holds her round the shoulders. his words have almost unmasked her. the closeness does the rest. she kisses him on the mouth and jumps out of the boat.}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{oh, will!}
<A>__{she throws a coin to the boatman and runs towards the house.}
<C>__{boatman}
<D>__{thank you, my lady!}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{lady?}
<C>__{boatman}
<D>__{viola de lesseps. known her since she was this high. wouldn't deceive a child.}
<A>__{will gets out of the boat.}
<C>__{boatman }
<P>__{(reaching under his seat)}
<D>__{strangely enough, i'm a bit of a writer myself.}
<A>__{the boatman produces his memoirs in manuscript.}
<C>__{boatman }
<D>__{it wouldn't take you long to read it, i expect you know all the booksellers . . .}
<A>__{but will has gone.}
