<A>__{four a.m.: streets empty. letour's sedan drops him off near a ten story west 80s apartment building. john gives the driver a forty dollar tip (standard procedure), turns the corner. he presses the intercom; a buzzer unlocks the door. he enters the lobby, walks past english reproduction furniture toward the elevators. presses the button. penthouse c door opens. ann lets john in with a smile. ann, forty four, striking in a tailored dress, greets him with a wet kiss. her hair is coiffured, her face made up. she is john's employer, mentor, confidante, mother hen: she keeps the books. her ingenuous demeanor belies sterner stuff: she's been in the drug business fifteen years. ann's apartment is a jumble of sensibilities: dark green walls, zebra skin sofa, haitian wall friezes, framed magazine photos of paramahansa yogananda, liz taylor, the duke of windsor paintings stacked behind an oversized urn. a bird flits in its cage. one corner of the living area is devoted to a fledgling cosmetics business: macintosh computer, billboard of trade paper clippings and ads, herbal samples, reference books, color charts. robert, fifty, slight, waves hello as john locks the door. gay, hip, worn, he's john's "co runner." they work and eat out of ann's apartment. take out tins of indian food are stacked amid crystals, tarot cards, glasses, and vitamin bottles. no sign of drugs, drug paraphernalia, or money.}
