<L>__{49: ext interior fire escape apartment. institute. dusk.}
<A>__{berlin looks down from the fire escape. for the first time the place sounds busy. cars arriving and doors slamming. voices of students coming back from the weekend. "why were you out there?" helena waits inside and didn't realize he was back in the room.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{coz i wanted to feel the snow on my face .. i think that's when i heard her call him john?}
<A>__{time to go and both know it. stale shadows and growing silence.}
<D>__{is it snowing now?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{no. getting dark though.}
<A>__{and his eyes are searching her so hard she must be aware of it.}
<D>__{you think you'd know this man? if he was in the room with you again?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{you've already asked me that ..}
<A>__{the silence is almost uncomfortable. berlin continues to stare.}
<D>__{amber's dead, isn't she?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{yes. i'm sorry.}
