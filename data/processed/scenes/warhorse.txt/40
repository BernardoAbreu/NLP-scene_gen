<L>__{interior officers' study. day.}
<A>__{stewart enters. a phonograph plays "roses of picardy." the walls are decorated with etchings of famous battles, and a large map of western europe that depicts how the english troops are crossing the channel to confront the germans near belgium. nicholls is writing a letter though actually at this moment, he is making a little pencil drawing of joey to enclose with it.}
<C>__{major stewart}
<D>__{what are you up to?}
<C>__{captain nicholls}
<D>__{i'm writing a letter.}
<C>__{major stewart}
<D>__{with a picture in it?}
<C>__{captain nicholls}
<D>__{it's to the boy who owned joey. i want to show him how wonderful he's looking.}
<C>__{major stewart}
<D>__{before we take him away across the channel to face a million germans guns.}
<C>__{captain nicholls}
<D>__{yes. before that...}
<C>__{major stewart}
<D>__{4 a.m. start tomorrow travelling with the dragoon guards and the royals. transport detachment they'll need to be at the docks at 5 am. check all kit. battle orders: no polishing buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup irons let `em all go dull. i want nothing to flash in the sun and give us away.}
<C>__{captain nicholls}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{as stewart leaves, he passes charlie. he casually acknowledges him.}
<C>__{major stewart}
<D>__{charlie...}
<C>__{charlie waverly}
<D>__{jamie.}
<C>__{captain nicholls}
<D>__{charlie.}
<A>__{charlie checks his new cap in the mirror.}
<C>__{charlie waverly}
<D>__{what do you think of the cap?}
<A>__{he shows the bright red lining to nicholls.}
<C>__{charlie waverly }
<D>__{silk lining. i quite like it.}
<C>__{captain nicholls}
<D>__{i'm not sure it's going to make a lot of difference to the germans.}
<C>__{charlie waverly}
<D>__{oh, i don't know about that. think about it you're a boche, just working out which of two chaps to shoot and you thought "good lord one of them really is wearing a very stylish cap indeed!" you might shoot the other one instead.}
<C>__{captain nicholls}
<D>__{or, alternatively, think "i fancy that cap" and kill you first of all.}
<A>__{pause. charlie removes the cap.}
<C>__{charlie waverly}
<D>__{hadn't thought of that.}
<A>__{nicholls returns to his sketch.}
