<L>__{interior police station night}
<A>__{a police officer is interrogating tilley behind the main desk of the police station. there's a lot of activity during this interaction... people coming and going.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{a guy breaks into my house and i'm being charged with assault? it makes no sense...}
<C>__{police officer}
<P>__{(with pencil and paper)}
<D>__{let's get it down right. the guy broke into your house, you hit him in the head with a gun, went to the refrigerator, took out eggs and tomatoes and threw them at him.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{i was defending myself... he was stealing from me.}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{it doesn't sound like defense to me.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{i wanted to humiliate the guy. here i am, out busting my ass all day making a decent living, i come home, and some schmuck is trying to steal from me.}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{so you hit him with a gun, and pelted him with eggs and tomatoes?}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{if i had some soup i would have thrown soup at him... is there any law you can't throw eggs?}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{mr. babowski claims he didn't break into your house.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{what did i do? invite him in so that i could throw eggs at him?}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{maybe mr. babowski intended to break into your house, but these circumstances of the guy being pelted with eggs and tomatoes is something we need to look into.}
<A>__{tilley shrugs his shoulders.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{he's lucky that he didn't rob me last week, 'cos then my wife was living at home and we had all kinds of things in the fridge... i could have thrown barley soup, pumpkin pie, candied yams... yeah, he got off light.}
