<L>__{interior the brain field}
<A>__{it's completely blank, just like the void. the vitals are flatlined. a single piece of thought text floats across the emptiness, almost like a screen saver:}
<D>__{say uncle.... say uncle...}
<L>__{exterior the wharf (a voice) night}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{uncle, hey...}
<A>__{a face, peering down at pentcho. the face belongs to the magic man, in a mad hatter hat, and a potpourri of found item clothing. like a baptist preacher on his sidewalk pulpit:}
<C>__{magic man}
<D>__{can you feel it, uncle? can you feel it right down to your bones?!}
<A>__{on pentcho: extreme close up inside each pupil is the reflection of the neon heart. we pull back on pentcho's face. calm. serene.}
<C>__{pentcho}
<D>__{yes. (beat) yes i can.}
