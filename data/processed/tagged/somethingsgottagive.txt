<A>__{midtown. a brunette beauty crosses in front of a stack of cabs, her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body. a club in the meatpacking district. a long line waits to get in. a couple of gorgeous girls show up at the velvet rope and are promptly" let inside. soho. a crowd spills out of a bar and onto the sidewalk. a confident knock out in jeans and a tank top laughs, drinking a beer out of the bottle.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{ahhhh... the sweet, uncomplicated satisfaction of the younger woman. that fleeting age when everything just falls right into place. it's magic time and it can render any man, anywhere absolutely helpless. some say i'm an expert on the younger woman. guess that's 'cause i've been dating them for over forty years...}
<L>__{into an empty frame comes harry langer}
<A>__{what is it about him? could be his eyes, the turn of his mouth...something about this guy is just so damn appealing. maybe it's just the way he wears the young slinky girl on his arm. he's confident, cool, enviable. we're in: a chic eatery downtown the place is full. everybody is somebody here.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(to hostess)}
<D>__{langer. ..}
<A>__{the maitre'd snaps to attention at the sight of him.}
<C>__{maitre'd}
<D>__{mr. langer, got your table waiting.}
<A>__{as harry and his girl wend their way around tables, we pass other couples. young couples. middle aged couples. not talking couples.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{so what does a life of bucking the system all add up to? harry (v.o.) (cont'd) to never settle down with the right woman for a life of leftovers and christmas mornings. no his and her ira accounts, no mini van parked in the garage. i think it's made me what i am today.}
<P>__{(harry smiles to someone across the room)}
<D>__{the luckiest son of a bitch on earth. look at me. i'm positively debonair. i should be illegal i'm lookin' so good.}
<A>__{harry passes a table where a beaten sixty year old dines with his age appropriate, well fed wife. in slow motion, harry and the beaten man catch each other's glance.}
<C>__{harry }

<A>__{harry enters all over again. this time he looks older, something in his walk and the boxy cut of his jacket. with him is a regular looking, nothing to write home about woman}

<C>__{harry }
<D>__{no, come on, let's be honest. ..a dame really my age. . .}
<L>__{interior chic eatery harry's imagination take two}
<A>__{again, the identical set up. harry enters again. this time he looks ten years older. the bounce to his step is gone. the twinkle in his eye, long dead. on his arm is a 63 year old battle ax, built just like harry. the maitre'd reluctantly shows them to a shitty table.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{there you have it. the story in a nutshell. not exactly debonair, am i?}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ for what?}
<A>__{harry waits. ringgg! he doesn't look away.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{for never dating anyone over 30. don't look at me like that.}

<C>__{marin}
<D>__{okay. sorry. over 31?}

<P>__{(then to marin)}
<D>__{it just so happens, my dear, that women of a certain age, don't date me. you ever think of it that way? no, it's always me. you dames are all alike.}

<D>__{i will call her later. no, i have it.}
<A>__{harry hangs up, doesn't look in marin's direction to see if' she caught that. this brand of cool is about not playing that card. marin turns toward him, she has been listening. they've reached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass and the ocean stretch before them.}

<P>__{(all business)}
<D>__{make a right, left at the second fence.}
<A>__{marin turns up the cd, getting herself out of whatever just came over her, looks out the window.}

<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(blushing)}
<D>__{yes you have actually.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{so it would be too much to mention it again. . .}
<A>__{marin laughs, softening, as harry turns down a dirt driveway, driving toward a dream beach house.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{wow. it's the perfect beach house.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{i know. my mother doesn't know how to do things that aren't perfect.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{which explains you.}
<A>__{that got her. harry parks. she looks over at him but he's grabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket, then looks up at her with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say such a lovely thought.}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(trying to keep up with him)}
<D>__{yeah, okay, right...}
<A>__{they both grab their h}

<C>__{marin}
<D>__{two minutes.}

<C>__{marin}
<D>__{oh har... no smoking in the house. my mom doesn't allow it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{but she allows you to strip in the front yard and bring men you're dating here to...}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{she doesn't know everything i do...or when i do it.. or where i do it.}

<A>__{it's one of those great beach houses. light filled and warm with spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around the rear of the house. marin, now in a tight tank, tight pants, gives harry the grand tour as she continues to undress.}

<D>__{ladies first.}

<C>__{marin}
<D>__{gourmet kitchen's to your left where tonight i will whip you up a culinary feast of mac and cheese.}
<A>__{marin hears harry's zipper unzip. she turns, her eyes widening as harry's pants land on a chair. harry is now down to his boxers, an open shirt and a fearless smile.}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{.. o kay, going quickly now... master bedroom is that away...}
<A>__{they arrive in a warmly decorated guest bedroom.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{and this as they say on 'cribs', your favorite show, is where the magic happens. do we like it? going once, going twice ...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sold.}
<A>__{harry takes marin's hand and pulls her out of frame and onto the bed. she playfully rolls on top of him. his hands cup her ass.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{you know when i first started auctioneering someone told me if i was nervous to just picture everyone in the audience in their underwear. this sort of gives that a whole new meaning.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{why? you're not nervous now, are you?}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{i'm always a little nervous.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(removing his hands)}
<D>__{so put on your bathing suit. i brought some champagne, i will put it on ice.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{me like you, harry langer.}
<A>__{she bounces off him like a kid and disappears into the bathroom. harry lies there alone for a second. catches his breath. he sits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his throat, bangs on his chest. he waits a sec then stands with a stiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that young man.}
<L>__{interior living room}
<A>__{now wearing only his boxer shorts, harry crosses through the living room, singing 'livin' it up' to himself. he reaches into his bag and lifts out two bottles of crystal. he sees himself in the mirror, sucks in his gut.}
<L>__{interior kitchen}
<A>__{well stocked, the best of everything. harry opens the door to the fridge and just as he disappears behind it, the back door opens and two women enter from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively conversation. one of them is erica, marin's mother. the other is erica's younger sister, zoe. erica is in her mid fifties and is a poster girl for growing old. it's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. and not because she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and right. erica is the "girl most likely" who went beyond expectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of herself was a handicap. she doesn't try to be intimidating, she just is. her sister, zoe is in her forties. zoe's the loose one. she wears draw string pants and a t shirt that says, "boys lie". the women stop mid sentence when they notice the refrigerator is wide open. then they see a pair of bare men's legs poking out from under the door. they don' t move.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{oh god. what is this?}
<A>__{erica nods to zoe, gesturing a nearby knife. zoe grabs the knife. harry pokes his head out from behind the fridge, equally confused.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(in control)}
<D>__{okay, stay right where you are. we have a knife.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(eyeing the knife)}
<D>__{do you... live here?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{okay, mister, look, i'm gonna dial 911 and you're not gonna move. zoe, hand me the phone.}
<P>__{(reaches out to zoe without looking at her)}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you don't understand. i'm a friend of your daughter's.}
<A>__{with that, harry shuts the fridge door. the women see he's naked except for a pair of boxers. they both gasp. zoe fumbles the phone over to erica who dials quickly..}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah? i don't think so. my daughter's in the city and you what, wandered in here,like high on ecstasy..?.}
<P>__{(looks at phone)}
<D>__{shit. i dialed 8 1 1.}
<P>__{(redials)}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(calmly starts to move)}
<D>__{honestly, if you just...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{back off. she was in the israeli army. she can break you in half.}
<A>__{zoe can't believe she just said that no truth in it whatsoever.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yes. i have an intruder in my house. 29 daniels lane, sagaponack.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm dating your daughter marin. she invited me here for the weekend. she's in her room right now, changing.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(gasps even louder, really scared now)}
<D>__{you're dating my daughter?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{now who would've thought that would be worse news?}
<A>__{with that, marin enters, in a tiny bikini, sees harry in his shorts, zoe holding the knife and erica frozen, holding the phone.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{oh, fuck.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{oh, god.}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. false alarm. yeah, no, i'm sure. no, he's not a burglar}
<P>__{(with enormous difficulty)}
<D>__{he's dating my daughter.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{mom, i had no idea you were coming out this weekend, you said you had to write.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i do. i thought i'd do it out here.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{oh, man, this is really....}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{awkward.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{totally.. .but....}
<P>__{(starts laughing)}
<D>__{you gotta admit, sorta funny you thought he was a burglar? in his boxer shorts?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah, well, the world's nuts, i don't know the man. . .}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(still laughing)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, it's not really funny. i'm an idiot. i should've told you i was bringing someone out.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{no, no, i should've told you we were coming. well. anyway, here we are.}
<P>__{(waves to harry)}
<D>__{hello. i'm the mother.}
<A>__{all three women turn to harry who now dangles a long lobster shaped oven mitt over his "privates"...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{harry langer. how are ya?}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{yes. sorry... mom, this is my friend, harry. harry, my mom, erica... my aunt, zoe.}
<P>__{(they all shake hands)}
<D>__{harry's sort of a new friend. i think i mentioned him in an e mail. we just, totally spur of the moment thought we'd get out of the city for a few days.}
<C>__{erica and zoe}
<D>__{of course...right...great...}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(can't look at him)}
<D>__{honey, does harry have a robe?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(backing out)}
<D>__{you know what? actually, i think i should just take off. let you gals enjoy your weekend...}
<A>__{marin shoots her mom a look. help!}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{no, no, no. don't be silly. uh, look, here's what we'll do. zoe and i will leave. we took a great walk on the beach, we'll go into town for lunch. you two stay. harry, apologize about the near arrest.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, you were impressive. very strong, very... "macho".}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(a little thrown)}
<D>__{i don't think i was exactly "macho" ...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{trust me, if i ever catch a guy in his underwear in my refrigerator i hope i'm half the man you were, mrs uh...}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(already hating him)}
<D>__{yeah. okay. whatever...}
<A>__{marin watches. dying.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{all righty then...i'm definitely gonna hit the road.}
<P>__{(salutes erica and zoe)}
<D>__{ladies...sensational meeting you.}
<P>__{(then to marin)}
<D>__{doll, call me.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{hold on. hold on. let's not get so dramatic here. what are we four teenagers? we're all sophisticated people. why can't we all stay, for the weekend? your mother's got work to do i've got papers to grade. you'll do your thing, whatever that is and if we want to hang together, we'll hang together. if we don't, we don't. there's no reason why any of us should give up this spectacular weekend.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{seriously. i can handle it.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i can totally handle it.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(on the spot)}
<D>__{i mean, well, i can "handle" it...}

<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{marin was how old when you guys broke up?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{five years ago, so. ..twenty three.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{okay, so she was old enough not to feel dave was walking out on her.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{is that supposed to mean dave walked out on me? why do people assume when you break up after twenty years that the guy's the one who wanted out? just because once we broke up he shtupped everything that moved...}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{easy cowgirl. i didn't mean it that way. just trying to figure out why such a smart girl is always with the wrong guy.}

<D>__{it's an epidemic.}
<A>__{then erica notices who's next to her at the cheese counter. she sees her sister, zoe, reading a cheese label with her glasses on and next to zoe are two sad looking old women in their eighties with their arms linked. almost woozy, erica is snapped out of it when she is handed her package.}
<C>__{young french girl}
<D>__{merci madame.}
<A>__{erica heads down the aisle, passing harry whose back is to her. just as she passes, he turns and almost bumps into her.}

<D>__{my fault.}
<A>__{they so very badly do not want to actually touch. erica hesitates. harry gestures for her to go first then walks alongside her.}

<D>__{let me see if i get where you're headed here. . .}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but, look, you know i hate rap, i mean i do. it's sort of violent and crude for my taste, not to mention just a tad misogynistic.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hey, a lot of people see rapping as poetry.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah, but come on, how many words can you rhyme with 'bitch'?}
<A>__{erica places her groceries on the check out counter.}

<D>__{well, the thing with me is that i'm about 90% hard word, 10% talent and so far the talent part hasn't exactly kicked in yet.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{yeah, right...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what's your play about?}
<A>__{marin and zoe stop what they are doing and turn to erica. she's hesitant to reveal this.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{about? well, i'm not exactly sure which is a bit of a problem, but so far it's about a divorced woman, a writer, she's this high strung, over amped, controlling, know it all neurotic. . .}
<P>__{(everyone stares at her)}
<D>__{who's incredibly cute and lovable.}
<P>__{(more stares)}

<D>__{ever been married, harry?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no. no, i haven't.}

<D>__{i guess people find it interesting that i've escaped the noose for so long.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{yeah, wasn't the name of the article, "the escape artist"?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{wait. i read that article. that was you? you were once engaged to somebody big. who was it? not joan collins.. .wait. ..carly simon?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{yeah, it was somebody cool like that.}
<P>__{(trying to remember)}
<D>__{not martha stewart....}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{you could just ..'ask him.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, this is more fun. it's like i'm not here.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{harry was once engaged to diane sawyer. okay?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{right. diane sawyer. i love her.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{i'm impressed.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, women your age love that about me.}
<A>__{erica pauses on that one.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(trying to get thru this)}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yes i do.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's not a bad thing to say 'women your age'.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{no...i'm sure it was a compliment.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it was. ..just the truth.}
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(stepping in)}
<D>__{so when was this engagement?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{long time ago. she was just this adorable lanky girl from kentucky with the greatest pair of legs i'd ever seen... never understood her ending up with a job where she never showed them.}
<P>__{(munches on his lobster)}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you're not serious? she's diane sawyer, she goes into caves in afghanistan with a shmahtah on her head. who cares about her legs?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{just anyone who's ever had the pleasure of... you know what? i hate to eat and run but...}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{no, wait. this is actually a very fascinating dynamic what's going on at this table...}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(warning him)}
<D>__{zoe teaches women's studies at columbia. . .}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh, so this is gonna hurt.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{no, come on, listen, here's the rub for women. look at what we have here with you and erica. harry, you've been around the block a few times, right? you're what? around 60, never been married, which, we all know, if you were a woman, would be a curse, you'd be an old maid, a spinster, blah, blah, blah... okay, so instead of pitying you, they write articles about you, celebrate your never marrying, it makes you illusive and ungettable. you're a real catch. then, take my gorgeous sister here...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{any chance of you stopping here?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{come on, this is interesting. i mean, look at her, she's so accomplished, the most successful woman playwright since who? lillian hellman? she's over fifty, divorced and still sits in night after night because the available guys her age want}
<P>__{(to marin)}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{ forgive me honey for saying this, but they want girls that look like marin so the whole over fifty dating scene is geared completely towards men leaving older women out and as a result that makes the older women more and more productive and more and more interesting, which, in turn, makes them even less desirable because as we all know men, especially older men, are threatened and deathly afraid of interesting and accomplished women. it's just so clear. single older women, as a demographic, are as fucked a group as can ever exist.}
<A>__{erica and harry's eyes connect for a millisecond. hear the}
<B>__{sound of plates crashing.}
<L>__{interior kitchen moments later}
<A>__{over, we erica is cleaning up the broken plates, zoe leans down to help.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{what are you, possessed? how could you say those things?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{it just seemed so obvious to me. the injustice of it. thank god men die younger than us. it's the only break we get.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{then you know what? write a dissertation on it, don't announce to the world that i stay in night after night after night and by the way, one night after night would have been enough. did you ever realize, i stay "in" as part of my job. why do you think i married the director of my plays? he was the only man i ever saw. anyway, i like staying in and i like this time in my life. why do i have to defend myself? i was married for 20 years. i'm done.}
<A>__{marin enters carrying more dishes.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{what the hell was that?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i thought i was onto something.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{honey, what are you doing with this guy? he's old, he's chauvinistic...}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{he's fun.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{he's fun? how is he fun? he's like.. .wrong.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{wrong can be fun, mom.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{not this wrong.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{can we not do this now? he's actually incredibly smart and fascinating and if you had talked to him about something other than his marital status you would've found out how smart he is. he owns like 10 different companies...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{what does that mean he owns ten different companies? he can't commit, that's what that means. not that, god forbid, i want him to commit.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{yeah, that i get. anyway, he said he thought you two were very spontaneous and nice and then said he's leaving as soon as the sun comes up.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{what? his car doesn't have headlights?}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{good night.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{wait. i have no right to get this nuts.}
<P>__{(hugs her)}
<D>__{he's your friend. not mine. i love you.}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(hugs her back)}
<D>__{i love you more.}
<A>__{this is obviously a ritual between them. erica kisses marin's cheek in a flutter of kisses, then marin}
<B>__{exits.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{no chance he said we were nice.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{please. none.}
<A>__{they hear music coming from marin's bedroom.}

<D>__{i know she'll never see him after this weekend. she can't commit either.}
<A>__{then they hear marin giggling.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{he does sound fun.}
<A>__{marin yelps.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{admit it, he's got something. you felt it, right?}

<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(yells, warning like)}
<D>__{i'm walking around the house!}
<A>__{erica laughs. even she knows this is funny. harry arrives at her open doorway, timidly pokes his head in.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{listen, i've decided to get over the whole "you saw me naked" thing. so, we don't have to deal with it anymore. okay?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{good, 'cause i've been hiding from you all day.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i know. you want to come in?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i don't want to break your rhythm or anything.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{that would be wishful thinking.}
<A>__{harry enters cautiously and curiously.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{beautiful painting. so i'm gonna venture out there and go for a short walk...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you up to that?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{my doctor recommended it. i gotta build up to stairs and stuff like that. you wouldn't want to join me?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{that means you don't want me to?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, i was asking if you wanted to.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{oh, well, i would but...i don't usually like to break once i've started writing so i probably shouldn't, not that a little fresh air would hurt but...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's just a walk erica, not a marriage proposal.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you know my name.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{erica jane barry. i looked you up on the internet.}
<L>__{exterior beach moments later late .in the day}
<A>__{erica and harry walk by the water's edge. they are the only two people on the beach.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ did you know there are over eight thousand websites that mention you?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{that can't be possible.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, it's true. i know everything about you now. and not because of last night, but...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah, i understood. i actually looked you up too. you grew up in l.a., which i thought nobody did.}
<C>__{erica }
<D>__{you were the road manager for a group i sorta never heard of, started your own record label at 29, sold it at 45, then started buying and selling boutique companies then invested in a small record company which you turned into the 2nd largest hip hop label in the world.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's exhausting just hearing about it.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i know, but the truth is, it goes fast doesn't it?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{like the blink of an eye.}
<A>__{erica bends down and picks up a flat white stone, then another and another...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i noticed you have bowls of those all over your house.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i know, i'm crazy, i just think they're so beautiful...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{but why do you only pick up the white ones?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i don't only pick up the white ones.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh, so you really are crazy.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i pick up only the white ones?}
<P>__{(looks in her hand)}
<D>__{oh, god, what does that mean? i'm controlling, unadventurous, what?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{so you're as hard on yourself as you are on everyone else.}
<A>__{erica is stunned that he caught on to that. harry bends down, picks up a brown stone, places it in her palm among the white stones.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{something to remember me by.}
<A>__{erica realizes she can't sum this guy up so easily or at all.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{so can i ask you something harry? what's with all the young girls? i mean, what's the story there, really?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i just like to travel light.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you just like to travel light? oh, please, what the hell does that mean?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{now see a thirty year old gets that.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you mean falls for that.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i mean, accepts it.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{if that's what you want... a non threatening woman, who won't get your number, you get to run the show...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i think our relationship is growing by the way. have you noticed?}
<A>__{there he goes again. she can't believe he's cute like this.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm serious. maybe we just needed to get out of the house. now, you may notice, interestingly, we're walking back toward the house and its getting a little rocky again.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{of course it's getting a little rocky, we're talking about you.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{see, i will accept that slight hostility because i'm enjoying your company so much.}
<A>__{they're reached the bottom of the beach stairs. harry looks up, daunted.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, but i think i'11 stay down here and watch the sunset. you interested?}
<A>__{erica checks her watch.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{big dinner date?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{well, yeah, as a matter of fact. with your doctor.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ohhhhh, my doctor, 'cause he's not too young for you, huh?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{no, he's totally too young for me. but we're just having dinner. it's not a date.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{does he know that?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{well, i will tell him, but i doubt that he thinks of it that way.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i doubt that you doubt that. anyway, you may like it. think of it this way he's not threatening, won't get your number, you get to run the show. you might have a hell of a time.}
<A>__{over, we hear, ding dong. that night the front door swings open and we find julian. looking just as any girl would hope. dream date.}
<B>__{and on the other side of the door}
<A>__{is harry, in his robe and pj's.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{hey, look who's answering the door.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and look who's at the door.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{brought you something.}
<A>__{julian hands him a take out food box.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{a heart healthy dinner from our cafeteria.}
<C>__{erica }
<D>__{hello...}
<A>__{both guys turn at once. she looks beautiful, wearing a dress, probably the sexiest one she owns. no turtleneck tonight. julian walks to her, kisses her on the cheek.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{you look beautiful.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{behind julian's back harry gives erica the 'ok' sign.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(thrown)}
<D>__{we ready..?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{let me just see how harry's doing. it'll take two seconds. har, have a seat. .}
<A>__{angle harry sitting, self conscious in his new role the sick one. julian takes his wrist, feels his pulse. harry looks straight ahead. what he sees erica's legs as she sits right in front of him. she crosses her legs and her dress hikes up a little, exposing her thigh. julian furrows his brow.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what? that's not the face you want to see your doctor making.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{your pulse is a little fast but maybe you're just excited about something.}
<A>__{harry looks at erica's legs again.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{i don't think so. i'm not excited about anything.}
<A>__{erica shifts, the hem of her skirt rising even higher.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{there it goes again. racing.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{doc... impossible!}
<A>__{erica rises, leaving harry's eye line.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{oh, there we go, now i feel better. back to normal.}
<A>__{harry winces then rises, looks to erica as she throws a pashmina over her shoulders in slow motion. harry rushes them}
<B>__{out the door.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{okay, all right, good, have fun, don't rush back for me and don't do anything i wouldn't do.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{well that wouldn't leave us too many options would it?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and do we wonder how she writes that snappy repartee.}
<P>__{(whispers to erica)}
<D>__{let him pick up the check. it'll make him feel older.}
<A>__{on erica's shocked expression, the door slams.}
<L>__{interior living room later that night a ben webster cd plays}
<A>__{harry lies on the sofa. camera moves up harry's body, past the hospital take out carton on his stomach and finally up to his face. as the camera moves we hear:}

<D>__{hi, it's marin, i'm not in so leave a message and i will call you back.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hey, it's me...just sitting around looking at your baby pictures... thinking about you...}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{everybody's out but old har.. .old, old old old har...}
<A>__{harry rises dizzily, crosses to the bookshelves. he rummages around, finds erica's scrapbook, pulls it out, randomly opens it, finds a photo of erica in the 70's, wearing a turtleneck. harry smiles.}
<L>__{interior erica's bedroom moments later}
<A>__{harry wanders in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm. he notices a bowl filled with white beach stones. harry's brown stone sits at the top of the pile.}

<B>__{close on julian}
<A>__{staring at erica. he can't get enough of her. they're in a romantic seaside restaurant. and erica's blushing for the first time in twenty five years.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{ so, when the land came up, i snatched it and the house was built in record time and...}
<P>__{(blushing to death)}
<D>__{it's like a thousand degrees in here.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{you know, they say doctors fall for people who need rescuing, that we have a need to take care of someone.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{really? i never heard that one.}
<P>__{(starts fanning herself with the menu)}
<D>__{julian, how old are you, like...}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{ thirty three.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{thirty three. okay, so, i'm twenty years older than you. more than twenty years older than you.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{you look fabulous.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{thank you but you know, i'm not sure where you were headed with that thing you were just saying, but in terms of us, you just want to be friends, right?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{honestly? no.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{well, then, what is it that you... want to be?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i think i'd embarrass you if i told you.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i was embarrassed just getting dressed to see you.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{this may surprise you but some women consider me quite the guy. i've never been married. i'm a doctor. you wouldn't believe what catnip that is for some women.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{oh yes i would. but, you don't like girls your own age?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i do very much. but i've never met one i've taken to quite like this and when something happens to you that's never happened to you before, don't you have to at least find out what it is?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i suppose but, see, i don't date all that much or all that well...}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{oh, come on, you must beat them away with a stick.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{now you're kidding, right? no, guys my age, the ones i've met...well, i'm not that regular a person and they really like regular.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{men your age may be really stupid, you ever think of that?}
<P>__{(takes her hand)}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yes i have. many times.}
<C>__{julian}
<P>__{(looks from her hand to her eyes)}
<D>__{there's something radically wrong with the idea that no one loves you.}
<A>__{ow. right to the middle of her shoulder, then her neck. julian kisses her palm, then her.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i knew you'd smell good.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{it's just...soap...}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{how much is soap that smells like this?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i don't know. i got it at the market.}

<D>__{no, swear to god, i'm not...}
<A>__{meanwhile, harry is sound asleep on erica's bed her scrapbook open against his chest. we hear the sound of acar pulling up to the house. harry wakes up. oh shit. he leaps out of bed, this is the fastest he's moved in days. a bit disoriented, he straightens the covers, looks around for other evidence then hightails it out of there.}
<L>__{interior living room a moment later}
<A>__{erica enters, letting out a huge sigh. she's brought back to reality when she hears the tv in harry's room. she heads his way, then changes her mind and stops.}

<L>__{interior erica's bedroom later}
<A>__{erica, in pj's and glasses, sits at her laptop, writing. she hears the chime of someone instant messengering her. it a message from harryl37. it says: what r u doing? we go back and forth between their two rooms. she answers: writing. hi. what r u doing? he writes: watching joan rivers sell jewelry. erica laughs when he adds: so was your date a date? she types: i think so... he types: i told ya. (then) you hungry? surprised, she types: i just had dinner. he writes: yeah, but women never eat on dates.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{how does he know everything!}
<A>__{she hesitates then types: actually am a little hungry but, i'm in my pjs. he writes: me too. pajama party? she stares at the screen biting her lip. he does the same. erica rises, looks in the mirror, checks out her boobs in her pajamas. they look so low. she opens a drawer, rifles through it, takes out a bra, takes out a better bra. in his bathroom, harry fixes his hair, tries to make more of it than he has. erica now wearing a bra under he pajamas, checks out her boobs again. better. she adjusts the straps. lifts them higher.}
<L>__{interior living room}
<A>__{erica and harry enter from opposite sides of the room, both in their pajamas.}

<D>__{me either.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{really? with your social life?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{my, dear, you are confusing sex with sleeping. sleeping is something i prefer to do alone.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{okay, good to know.}
<P>__{(heading for the kitchen)}
<D>__{so, what are you hungry for?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(joining her)}
<D>__{what are my choices? i mean i know you think i'm not very discriminating but...}
<A>__{she looks through the fridge.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{oh, god, what's the difference what i think. i can't imagine what you think of me. okay, so... pasta, left over coq au vin, turkey sandwich or grilled cheese.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{pancakes.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{totally what i wanted. blueberries?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you ever miss being married? i bet you were great at it.}

<D>__{oh, right, but you don't have to answer that.}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{will you tell me first why you only miss being married at night?}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(cracking eggs)}
<D>__{oh, 'cause the phone doesn't ring as much at night and the "alone" thing happens at night and sleeping by myself took some getting used to. but i got the hang of it. you gotta sleep in the middle of the bed. it's absolutely not healthy to have a side when no one has the other side.}
<A>__{she starts mixing the batter.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{okay, now i'm convinced what i think of you is right.}

<D>__{i'm sorry.}

<D>__{soft lips...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i'm so glad they still work.}

<D>__{well, well, now look who's got}
<A>__{something that works... they both look down at harry. hello, mr. midnight.}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{me too.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{but so far the kissing is spectacular.}
<P>__{(he looks at her)}
<D>__{i'm not grading you, just mentioning it. brilliant.}
<A>__{he tries to kiss her neck but the turtleneck is in the way. he pulls it down, but it's tight and it's, difficult to get to her.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{can't get past your damn turtleneck. . .}
<A>__{he tries lifting the shirt from the bottom, it's awkward, he doesn't want to be down there yet. he comes back up when erica reaches to her night table, slides opens the drawer, takes out a scissors and hands it to him.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{cut it off... please.}
<A>__{what a brilliant invitation. he takes the scissors and starts cutting from the bottom, right past her belly, up her torso, between her breasts. the turtleneck falls open from the center. when he reaches her neck, he gently tears at it and it easily rips apart and there she is. he takes her in.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you're beautiful.}
<A>__{she shakes her head, 'no' ...shuts her eyes.}
<C>__{harry}

<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i think we should take your blood pressure.}
<A>__{his head pops back into frame. what?????}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{it's irresponsible not to.}
<A>__{harry ' a minute later sprawled out on the bed. erica straddles him and whips the blood pressure cuff on his arm and pumps it hard. like a warm jewish mother of a dominatrix. he looks up at her, shaking his head...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{nobody but you would. . .}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah...so you're lucky.}
<A>__{erica grabs harry's glasses, reads the results.}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you certainly do.}
<A>__{erica arrives next to him, also out of breath.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{wow. so this is what you're supposed to do on a rainy afternoon...}
<A>__{harry smiles. he's trying to be his debonair self but something's off. he's very aware of himself. they lie there quietly for a second when erica begins to tear up. harry slowly, nervously turns to her.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i really thought i was sorta closed for business. just never expected this.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{nothin's ever surprised me more...}
<A>__{flattered, erica snuggles up close. harry puts his arm around her. then, with no warning, his eyes fill with tears.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{this is crazy. i can't remember the last time i cried. i think i'm overwhelmed.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(crying with him)}

<D>__{you know i'm not good at being monogamous, right?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{monogamous? please, i hardly know you.}
<A>__{he looks at her wondering if she's for real. she smiles as she wipes a small tear from the corner of her eye. then he kisses her. later they're huddled under the covers cozy. candles light the room. it's still raining.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ so there i was at nineteen, in new york, by myself, and i'd never seen snow before and i didn't have enough money for the bus, so i had to walk. had no idea how far it was and i'm talking blizzard and i'm in sneakers.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{awwwww,. . .}
<A>__{later they're lying on a chaise in erica's room, making out. a cell phone rings. they both look around for it. erica reaches for it on her desk.}
