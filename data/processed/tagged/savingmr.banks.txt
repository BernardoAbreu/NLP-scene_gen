<A>__{a whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky, spinning, spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst white fluffy clouds. a shadow (oddly shaped like an umbrella) dances amongst the nimbus.}
<C>__{travers }
<D>__{ like something is brewing, about to begin }
<A>__{the shadow's direction becomes purposeful taking us down through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small town in the distance.}
<C>__{travers }
<D>__{ can't put me finger on what lies in store }
<A>__{downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large, bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens. there, a ten year old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large park she sits in benches made from twigs, trees from flowers, picnic cups from acorns and gives a satisfied nod. she wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face to the sky, a half smile threatening to break across her concentrated face. this is the young p.l. travers (whom we will also know as ginty.)}
<C>__{travers }
<D>__{ but i feel what's to happen, all happened before }
<A>__{her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind becomes real.}

<A>__{p.l. travers sits in her rocking chair (in the same position as above) arms clasped tightly around her body, face to the sky. older, beautiful; striking blue eyes aid her air of stiff and steely determination. her office is a canvas of a life well travelled. buddha smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the walls alongside pictures of pamela throughout the years with men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding. despite the multitude of objects, the room is peaceful, white. downstairs the doorbell rings. pamela closes her eyes, breathes. it rings again, pamela shakes her head, tuts. she stands up, smooths down her skirt with flat palms. breathes.}

<D>__{and the cold and the wet would be seeping through the shoes and the skin would be raw and peeling from our faces and sometimes i'd find myself sunk down in the snow, waking up, cuz i must've passed out for a moment i dunno. then school, too cold to figure out an equation. and back into the snow so by the time we got home it'd be just getting dark, and every part of you would sting like crazy as it slowly came back to life in the warmth. my mother would feed us dinner and then it'd be time to go out again for the evening edition.}
