<C>__{newscaster }
<D>__{as l. a. p. d. officers gather evidence at this grisly crime scene, you can only ask yourselves what kind of lunatic would commit such unthinkable crimes?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{the three adjectives which best describe this killer are sadistic, intelligent, and dangerous...}
<A>__{the guy pays little attention to the broadcast. he seems almost bored by it. like this kind of news is commonplace. or he's got more important things on his mind. everybody is sweating. including the two men struggling to swim upstream in the river of pedestrians. their uniforms are freshly pressed. their shoes just recently shined. hair tightly cropped. faces perfectly shaved. clearly men proud to wear the badge of the los angeles police department. the guy in the lead is}

<D>__{his body is a running back's. his endurance a marathoner's. his face one you'd want for your own. he's in his 30s. if he was in his 20s, you'd still be jealous.}
<A>__{his partner is john donley, late 20s, eager to prove himself. he struggles to keep up with parker. john accidently knocks over several pedestrians. they give no reaction, except to pick themselves up and continue on their way. parker and john keep charging. their conversation breathless:}

<D>__{good afternoon. may i help you?}
<A>__{parker spots sid 6.7 across the room. without hesitation the hunter chases his prey. gun out and firing. not what you would call standard police procedure. bullets riddle sid 6.7's table as he dives from his chair. he lands next to a bowling ball bag, which sits beneath his table. john charges from the other direction until a woman gets up from her chair, standing directly in john's line of fire.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(to the woman)}
<D>__{lady, move!}
<A>__{before she can do so, sid 6.7 stands behind the woman, grabbing her and throwing her across the table into parker. crash! they tumble to the floor. in the same movement, sid 6.7 removes a gun from inside his jacket and shoots john in the shoulder before he can fire. john's gun flies from his hand. sid 6.7 advances toward him. parker struggles to his feet. aims his weapon. sid 6.7 does the same, but without looking. boom! parker gets a bullet through his shooting arm. his wound identical to john's. parker's weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp. parker charges him wildly, but sid 6.7 brutally kicks him in the stomach. in perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in the background. parker doubles over, gasping for breath. another kick drops parker to his knees.}
