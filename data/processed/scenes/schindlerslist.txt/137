<L>__{exterior balcony goeth's villa night}
<A>__{distant music, brahms' lullaby, from the rosner brothers way down by the women's barracks calming the inhabitants. up here on the balcony, schindler and goeth, the latter so drunk he can barely stand up, stare out over goeth's dark kingdom.}

<D>__{they don't fear us because we have the power to kill, they fear us because we have the power to kill arbitrarily. a man commits a crime, he should know better. we have him killed, we feel pretty good about it. or we kill him ourselves and we feel even better. that's not power, though, that's justice. that's different than power. power is when we have every justification to kill and we don't. that's power. that's what the emperors had. a man stole something, he's brought in before the emperor, he throws himself down on the floor, he begs for mercy, he knows he's going to die... and the emperor pardons him. this worthless man. he lets him go. that's power. that's power.}
<A>__{it seems almost as though this temptation toward restraint, this image schindler has brush stroked of the merciful emperor, holds some appeal to goeth. perhaps, as he stares out over his camp, he imagines himself in the role, wondering what the power schindler describes might feel like. eventually, he glances over drunkenly, and almost smiles.}
