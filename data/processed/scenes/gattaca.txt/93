<L>__{exterior gattaca wind farm. afternoon.}
<A>__{a forest of wind turbines, supplying energy to the aerospace complex. however the blades of the turbines are motionless in the still afternoon. jerome finally catches up with irene. she turns, unsurprised by his appearance. standing beside her, he looks out over the complex as if he too has come for the view.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(eyes fixed on the view)}
<D>__{we were looking at each other. you stopped.}
<A>__{irene, also keeps her gaze ahead.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't mean anything.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(shrugging as if it makes no difference to him)}
<D>__{we were just looking.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{i know about you.}
<A>__{jerome turns to her, startled, trying to read her face. irene takes a deep breath and abruptly plucks a long, dark hair from her head.}
<C>__{irene}
<P>__{(offering the hair to jerome)}
<D>__{here, take it.}
<A>__{jerome, confused, takes the hair more in reflex than intent.}
<C>__{irene}
<P>__{(a challenge)}
<D>__{if you're still interested, let me know.}
<A>__{jerome contemplates the hair in his fingers for a moment, then deliberately lets it fall to the grounf.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(never taking his eyes from her)}
<D>__{sorry, the wind caught it.}
<A>__{irene meets his gaze. there is not a breath of wind. the hair lies, plainly visible on the ground.}
