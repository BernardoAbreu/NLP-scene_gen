<A>__{from the far wall edgar begins to glide forward, first in slow motion then ramping up to full speed, launching himself at the glass window. he bounces off it, leaving blood and saliva there. the professor and the console operator share an unsettled glance. edgar slowly stands. he stares very intently at the glass window in front of him. we zoom in on the glass. the small hair line fracture we saw previously now begins to lengthen before our eyes. edgar's face. a smile. then he is forward at high velocity before anything else can happen, smashing once more into the glass window, this time shattering it into a thousand tiny pieces.}
