<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{a kid is walking down the street, playing idly, by himself, as the truck starts to approach from behind.}
<C>__{sanford }
<D>__{we'd go a different direction every time, never hit the same part of town twice. sometimes we'd go for hours, just driving around, until we found somebody.}
<A>__{the truck comes beside the kid and gordon leans out the window. changeling a true story}
<C>__{sanford }
<D>__{he'd use all kinds of different stories. sometimes he'd say he had free tickets for the circus, or he was looking for a lost dog...that one worked real good. other days }
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{there you are, we've been looking for you like mad.}
<A>__{flash image: to a different kid, a different street.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{you have?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{sure thing. your folks, they got in an accident. they sent us to find you. they're hurt real bad. the police took 'em to the hospital, but they didn't have time to come find you, so we said we'd do it. now come on, hurry...we gotta get to the hospital, see your folks.}
<A>__{flash image: yet another kid, who hesitates, looks to sanford.}
<C>__{sanford }
<D>__{a lot of kids won't get in a car alone with a stranger, but when he's got a kid there with him, that made it easier.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they'd look to me, and figure if i was safe, they would be too. that's why he needed me, see?}
<C>__{sanford}
<D>__{it's okay. come on in.}
<A>__{flash image: back to the first kid, who takes one last beat, then gets into the car.}
<C>__{sanford }
<D>__{every time they got in the truck, it was like i wanted to die.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{good boy! now hold on, it's a long drive and we gotta fly.}
<A>__{and the truck heads off. changeling a true story}
<C>__{sanford }
<D>__{then, as soon as we got back to the ranch...they went in the coop.}
