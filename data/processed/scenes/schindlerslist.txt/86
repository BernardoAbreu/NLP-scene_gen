<L>__{exterior ghetto day}
<A>__{the wheels of the last truck clear the portals at lwowska street and the sonderkommandos jump down.}
<L>__{interior apartment buildings dawn}
<A>__{families are routed from their apartments. an appeal to be allowed to pack is answered with a rifle butt; an unannounced move to a desk drawer is countered with a shot.}
