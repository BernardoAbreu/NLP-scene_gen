<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{there are three possibilities here. we'll call them one, two and three. the level one scenario is that there is a sane individual, who for real reasons wants to do you harm. i really don't believe that's what we're looking at here. in my opinion, whoever this is, they don't want to do harm to you all. that's kind of clear.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the level two scenario is, this is a mentally unstable person who's fixated on you and your family. this is a possibility, but a very slim one.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i assure you i will treat all three possibilities carefully, but in all likely hood we are looking at what we'll call a level three scenario. he's a watcher. someone who this is a game for. he's laying low. doesn't want to be seen. but he wants to watch you. study you folks.}
<A>__{officer paski walks towards the windows. graham, merrill and morgan follow him with their eyes. officer paski walks next to the television. on the screen with the sound almost muted, is an aerial shot}

<A>__{officer paski turns to them. graham, merrill and morgan stare at the screen.}
<C>__{officer paski}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe you guys should do something fun? let me worry about this person. let me find out who it is and then what the hell are you people looking at?}
<A>__{edgar comes around to see the screen.}
<B>__{we are on a tv screen. the crops sway in the breeze. a handful of people are waving from the diamonds on the field.}

<D>__{ images were shot yesterday afternoon by a thirty four year old local camera man in kerala, a southern city of india. it is the eighteenth reported crop circle found in that country in the last seventy two hours.}
<A>__{the television report cuts to columbia university professor.}
<C>__{professor }
<D>__{crop circles first emerged in the late seventies with the renewed interest in extraterrestrial life. they died out by the early eighties; dismissed as hoaxes. this new resurgence is wholly different. elements of it are unexplainable. the speed and the quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds of individuals over many countries...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there is only a limited amount of explanations. either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever created, or basically...}
