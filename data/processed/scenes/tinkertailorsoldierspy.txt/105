<A>__{ricki tarr's p.o.v. as irina walks back out of the bathroom, picks up a vase and hurls it at boris, just missing him. he stubs out his cigarette and calmly climbs out of the bed. as we watch he draws the curtains along the length of the room, obscuring our view. seconds later the curtains billow as irina is thrown against them. we watch as her shape is rolled along the window by the force of boris' blows. finally the billowing fabric settles. moments later boris opens the curtains again and starts to dress. irina lies on the bed.}
