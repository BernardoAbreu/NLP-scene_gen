<L>__{exterior arthur's war camp night}
<A>__{converging from different directions parties of mounted knights enter the war camp. lancelot among them. they dismount, battle weary and burning with the excitement of victory. they quench their huge thirst from buckets carried by squires. they rip off hunks of meat from carcasses sizzling on spits over a roaring fire. and they join the throng of knights, where stories of deeds of arms of the day are enthusiastically exchanged. a great number of knights are packed tightly around king arthur, each man anxious to tell of his victories. one of them has the king's attention.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{...we killed every one of them. burnt their ship...}
<A>__{arthur sees lancelot in the throng and moves toward him. merlin follows arthur and is pushed and knocked around in the crush of spikes and iron. the only unarmored man in the crowd, he glares at the excited knights irritably.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{lancelot, how did you fare in the north?}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{we spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of king arthur's knights...}
<A>__{arthur turns toward uryens.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{and you, uryens?}
<C>__{uryens}
<D>__{victory!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{lot, and you?}
<C>__{lot}
<D>__{we drove the invaders into the sea.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you, gawain, the east?}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{the east is ours again.}
<A>__{cheers greet each declaration.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{the war is over. one land, one king. peace.}
<A>__{amidst the celebration, a fracas is heard. a knight pushing forward to talk to arthur has entered a shoving match with those in front of him.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{let me through. i fought the king's battle too. he must know my story.}
<A>__{merlin is brutally jostled. he draws a fistful of powder from his cape and he tosses it into the air above him. he raises his staff into the cloud, cracking it like a whip. the tip of the staff catches fire, and the fire spreads through the powder in the air, stunning all into silence. merlin shouts and snarls.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{chaos... confusion... brutes... savages... troglodytes... stand back... make space.}
<A>__{merlin swings his burning staff into a wide arc. the knights back away, amused at first, then a bit afraid.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{the moon... the sun... the stars... they spin... they turn... they circle... around us... us...}
<A>__{the knights have fallen back. merlin stalks past each man, and arthur too, holding the flaming tip of his staff before each pair of eyes, and staring into them with his gimlet gaze.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{you, and you, and you, take up your place. be wedded to the world. respect its perfection. all of you, together, be one.}
<A>__{the knights have formed a circle. they realize this. awestruck, they whisper in astonishment, looking up at the sky burning with stars. merlin brims with pride as he waits for arthur to recognize his handiwork.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{your ancient wisdom and infinite sight have forged this circle, merlin. hereafter we shall come together in a circle, to tell and hear of deeds good and brave. i will build a table where this fellowship shall meet. and a hall around the table. and a castle about the hall.}
<A>__{a cheer rises. arthur strides into the ring of knights.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{and i will marry.}
<A>__{another bout of cheers goes up, and arthur stops before leondegrance, resting his hand on the old knight's shoulder.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{and the land will have an heir to wield excalibur.}
<A>__{leondegrance's eyes fill with tears of joy. a roar of cheers. arthur draws the sword of power.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{knights of the round table, good friends, brothers in arms. i send you on a quest harder by far than the battles we have fought together, a quest to uphold always, and everywhere, justice, honor, and truth. each day shall bring forth a cause, and may each cause bring forth a knight.}
<A>__{lancelot is drawn in by the king's enthusiasm. he unsheathes his sword and swoops it low in salute.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{i swear never to rest twice on the same pillow till all men live at peace.}
<A>__{in quick succession all knights draw their swords, following lancelot's example. merlin struggles to put out the flame on his staff. he finally does it by smothering it with earth. when he looks up again, he sees the knights galloping off in all directions.}
