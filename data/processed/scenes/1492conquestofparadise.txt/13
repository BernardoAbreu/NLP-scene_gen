<L>__{exterior cadiz streets and cathedral square night}
<A>__{columbus leads the mule, carrying the sleeping fernando, through narrow streets. there's a clamorous noise in the air. suddenly a large group of young men, shouting with excitement, run up the street and brush past them. then more people. fernando sits up straight. the noise grows, rowdy, rumbling, sharp with excitement and violence. huge crowds have thronged the massive old square outside the cathedral. holding the mule by its reins, columbus tries to push his way through... suddenly, as a gap opens in the crowd, we see the cause of the excitement: in the center of the square stand three pyres, already alit. hooded executioners are busy around the fires.}

<D>__{look, father!}
<A>__{before columbus can stop him, fernando has slipped off the mule and into the crowd.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{fernando!}
<A>__{but the boy has been swallowed into the mass of people. columbus tries to follow him. flames leap into the night sky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square with a lurid glow. prayers are being chanted somewhere. fernando has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd. a priest brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a man bound to a post. the heretic wears the "sambenito", a robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been crudely illustrated we see cabalistic signs, indicating that the man is jewish. the man's eyes are mad with fear. but he refuses to kiss the crucifix, as a sign of his repentance. fernando is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't realize what is happening. he is too close to the platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{fernando!}
<A>__{he motions to his son, takes the boy's hand, and drags him away from the scene. but fernando looks back. the distance now allows him to see inside the flames. a half charred figure the man's face is distorted in a silent scream... the neck snaps like burning wood, and the head falls on one shoulder. then the whole body collapses into the fire.}
