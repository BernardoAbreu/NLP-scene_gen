<A>__{the moon is full. as we look down on the fort we can hear a new sound coming off the prairie. a light rumbling.}
<L>__{interior quarters night}
<A>__{lieutenant dunbar is asleep in the moonlight. the rumbling is getting louder. it wakes him. he gropes about, lights the lantern and listens to the strange, powerful sound. something's in the air. he holds the lantern toward the ceiling. particles of dirt and dust are being shaken from the roof. it's the earth that's trembling.}
