<L>__{exterior dual carriageway day}
<A>__{the mid morning traffic flows by on the dual carriageway.}
<L>__{interior happy eater day}
<A>__{nadia and john sit in silence in the half empty diner. nadia has a cut lip and a graze on her chin. john has a thousand yard stare and a lesion over his left cheekbone. the waitress comes over.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{good morning. what can i get you?}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{i will have an espresso, with a small pastry, a croissant or something.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{we only do a croissant with the continental breakfast.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{just get me a coffee.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{one coffee. and for you sir ?}
<A>__{john doesn't answer.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{he'll have a coffee.}
<A>__{the waitress leaves them. nadia lights a cigarette and they sit in tense silence, the pain of betrayal, and recent violence, thick in the air.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you can't smoke in here.}
<A>__{nadia ignores him. john bellows}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you can't smoke in here!}
<A>__{the diner falls silent, people stare. she takes a last drag and crushes the butt on the floor. a waitress comes over and puts down two coffees.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{i don't expect you to understand.}
<A>__{it seems as if john has no intention of replying. he sips his coffee, and puts it down. he begins speaking very calmly.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh, i don't know. in my job as deputy assistant of new business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. this took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. but, you see, i'm not in that line of work anymore. nowadays i'm a bank robber.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{you don't understand anything.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i think that about covers it. i think i have grasped the part about you being dumped though. that's got to hurt, i imagine. that's got to smart a bit. i mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on pretty fucking famously.}
<A>__{he sips his coffee.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{unless. unless this is part of the routine. you get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and steal my cup of coffee.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{it's makes it easier. okay.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't want to know.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{it makes it faster. if i don't speak to the men, they fall faster. it's pretty obvious why.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that's a relief. it's nice to know i'm a regular guy.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{so what are you going to do?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm going to drink my coffee. then, we're going to the police station. where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{they don't blame you. when a bank employee does this they understand. you get your life back. anyway i bet you hated that bank.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{even so i always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{why else would you send off for me? if you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{well as it turns out i did.}
<A>__{she slaps his face. he slaps hers back. the waitress comes over.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{more coffee?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yes please.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she pours for john.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{splendid. thank you.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{pleasure.}
<A>__{she smiles and leaves them. john watches her walk away.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{john, i need your help.}
<A>__{this really tickles john. he has to put his coffee down.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you must think... i'm the biggest pillock... in the world.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{no i don't.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{in the world.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{i know you just want to punish me }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i do. i want to very badly.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{so you're just going to be vindictive}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{in every sense. if at all possible.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{you can't hurt me more than i'm hurt already.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{well, nadia, it it's all the same to you, i'd like to give it a bash.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{my name isn't nadia.}
<A>__{john stares back at her.}
