<A>__{costa takes the gun from her purse, pockets it, along with her fbi credentials and car keys. costa backs away from grace. costa's physicality transforms from hip art dealer to something much more menacing. the monster martin asher. grace looks him dead in the eye, more angry than scared. (note: costa will now be called asher.)}

<C>__{grace}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{i should have cut her throat when i saw her on the ferry. that's the least she deserves. please don't do anything, grace. it would hurt me so much if i had to hurt you.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{good idea. don't hurt me.}
<A>__{costa shakes his head, his brow set with a grim determination. he turns, enters a stairwell and exits the building. grace's heart is breaking.}
