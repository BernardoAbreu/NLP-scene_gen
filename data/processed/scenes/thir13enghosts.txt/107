<A>__{they're both holding opposite sides of the door. the corridor's empty. covered with dark patches. they carefully inch their way down the corridor, passing dark areas. they reach a couple of dark patches, and slowly walk past. prepared for anything... when suddenly, out of the shadows, the '50s kid swings his bat, and smacks the door sparks fly.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{shit he's swinging for the fence.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{ram him on three... rafkin and arthur brace themselves. the '50s kid continues to whack away at the door.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(fast count)}
<D>__{one two three!}
<A>__{they drive the '50s kid into the wall. pressing the door against him. sparks light up the corridor. the '50s kid is going crazy. there's a huge burst of ecto plasmic sparks, then he vanishes.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{that's more like it.}
<A>__{arthur spots an opening behind them.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{this way...}
<A>__{arthur guides them down another corridor.}
