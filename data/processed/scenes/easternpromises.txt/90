<L>__{interior trans siberian restaurant day}
<D>__{semyon sits at a bare table, opposite yuri from the russian desk. a uniformed officer stands nearby, and there is a police doctor with a medical bag sitting at the next table, waiting. the whole scene is rendered surreal by all the balloons which bounce around them. semyon is in full charming old man mode.}
<C>__{semyon}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{you'll have a drink, yuri... he is half on his feet.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{i don't drink on duty.}
<C>__{semyon}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{sometimes i don't believe you are really russian.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{i've told you, i am half russian.}
<C>__{semyon}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{then have half a drink. yuri shakes his head. semyon goes to the optic and helps himself to a vodka.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{so what is all this nonsense?}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{we just need a blood sample.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{we can take the sample right now voluntarily or i can get an order from the court. it's up to you. semyon glances at the doctor and chuckles.}
<C>__{semyon}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{he sits there like a vampire.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{what, you are afraid of needles, semyon? semyon's face hardens and he glares at yuri.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{i am afraid of... conspiracies. a pause. yuri speaks softly.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{i will return tomorrow with a court order. he gets to his feet.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{wait. i've done nothing wrong. semyon begins to roll up his sleeve, revealing a long scroll of tattoos. then a needle is being pushed into semyon's arm by the doctor. semyon's face doesn't flicker. he stares into yuri's eyes.}
