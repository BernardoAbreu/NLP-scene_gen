<A>__{no sign of life. still the humming; it's a broadway show tune.}

<A>__{lowenstein is there, all alone, silhouetted in the moonlight. he uses the rail like a ballet bar, returning to it each time he finishes a small combination of dance steps. the moves are not extravagant, there is not highkicking. just a nice, smooth little combination that lowenstein is repeating, again and again. he hums his own accompaniment. then, softly at first, from the distance, comes the thumping of running shoes on old wood. it grows as lowenstein completes another repetition. when the thumping has gotten close, it slows, then stops raggedly. lowenstein looks that way.}

<D>__{peter?}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{hi, ned.}
<A>__{racine walks up, dripping sweat, already extracting his cigarettes from his shorts.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{i've been looking for you.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{yeah. you always run this late?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{nah. i'm going to miami tomorrow. i'm not gonna have time.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{what's in miami?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i'm closing this real estate deal i've been working on. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<A>__{lowenstein nods and turns to lean over the rail. racine offers him a cigarette. lowenstein accepts and racine lights both of theirs. lowenstein glances at racine's pack as racine puts it away.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{you're some kind of health nut.}
<P>__{(racine smiles)}
<D>__{matty walker smokes that same brand. i noticed that.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{is this gonna be one of those conversations? maybe i should have my lawyer present.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{buddy, your lawyer is present.}
<A>__{they look at the ocean.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{you know, that edmund walker was a bad guy. the more i find out about him, the happier i am he's dead. i figure it's a positive thing for the world.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{you're not known for being a hardliner.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{mmm. i have my own standards. i try to keep them private.}
<P>__{(he looks at his cigarette)}
<D>__{as far as i'm concerned, i don't care who killed him. and i don't care who gets rich because of it.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{but oscar, oscar's not like that. his whole life is based on doing the right thing. he's the only person i know like that. sometimes it's a real pain in the ass. even for him.}
<A>__{lowenstein glances at racine, but only for a moment.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{oscar's unhappy right now. he's in pain.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{why is that? converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{because he likes you. he likes you even better than i do.}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{that's why he's been busting his butt trying to locate this mary ann simpson. they finally found her place in miami yesterday, but the woman herself was gone... looked like she left in a hurry.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{oscar thought any story she could tell might help you. he thinks you need help.}
<A>__{racine turns around, drapes his arms back along the rail and lets his head loll, like a tired runner.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{someone's putting you in deep trouble, my friend. from about three thirty to five am on the night walker was killed, someone called your hotel room repeatedly. the hotel didn't want to put them through, but whoever was calling convinced them it was an emergency. the phone rang and rang, but you didn't answer.}
<A>__{racine looks at him.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{don't say anything. save it for some other time. it gets worse.}
<P>__{(he stamps out his butt)}
<D>__{now someone's trying to give us edmund's glasses. we don't know who. we don't know what the glasses will tell us. but our negotiations are continuing.}
<A>__{lowenstein steps away, toward the street. he looks sad.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{i wish i knew what to tell you, ned. but i don't have any good ideas.}
<A>__{he turns and walks away.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{i will see ya.}
<A>__{racine watches him go. he takes out his pack of cigarettes and extracts one. he stares at the pack in his hand.}
