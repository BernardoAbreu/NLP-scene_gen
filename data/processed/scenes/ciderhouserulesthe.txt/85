<L>__{exterior orchards morning}
<A>__{wally in his farm clothes at the wheel of the jeep he is racing through the orchards, dodging trees, with homer in the passenger seat, hanging on for dear life.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{remember this! in the morning, when the tall grass is wet, you can make the jeep slide on the grass. can you feel it?}
<A>__{homer is excited as wally weaves among the trees faster and faster.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{it's almost like flying.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{what about the trees?}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{the trees are flak antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.}
<A>__{wally brakes hard. the jeep comes to a stop in the packing house area. candy has been waiting on the loading platform. the pickers are working in the background.}
<C>__{wally}
<P>__{(defensively to candy)}
<D>__{i was just showing homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.}
<C>__{candy}
<P>__{(good naturedly)}
<D>__{i know what you've been doing.}
<A>__{she pulls an apple branch, with an apple to two, out of the vehicle's grille or else the branch is wedged in the front bumper or headlight area. candy playfully starts poking wally with the branch.}
<C>__{candy}
<P>__{(to wally)}
<D>__{you've been giving him a flying lesson!}
<C>__{wally}
<P>__{(teasing her)}
<D>__{he loved it!}
<P>__{(to homer)}
<D>__{didn't you?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{yeah, it was great.}
<A>__{wally gets the apple branch away from candy. he pins her arms at her sides he hugs her, kisses her. she doesn't struggle.}
<C>__{candy}
<P>__{(laughing to homer)}
<D>__{he thinks people like to get whacked by branches.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{homer liked it!}
<P>__{(to homer)}
<D>__{didn't you?}
