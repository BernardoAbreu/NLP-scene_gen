<L>__{interior pocket kitchen late night}
<A>__{the best chef in america has just fixed himself a snack as a salve to his spirits. it's a little like dagwood bumstead as a culinary genius..this is a snack we will remember and copy...john is approaching a perfect moment...and this is a guy who appreciates simple pleasures to the fullest...}
<L>__{interior clasky house living room}
<A>__{he carries the brilliant snack to the living room and is just about to take his first bite when he hears emotional spanish voices approaching. he looks up.}
<B>__{angle on flor and cristina}
<A>__{as they enter. cristina translating her mother's words.}
<C>__{cristina}
<D>__{my mother wishes me to represent exactly what she says, nothing else.}
<A>__{and so, for the remainder of the scene, flor will speak in spanish and cristina will not only translate but render her mother's emotion, sometimes including body language. it is not only a translation but a reenactment.}
<C>__{cristina as flor}
<D>__{may i talk to you?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you mean your mother....}
<A>__{cristina nods...not comfortable breaking the rule of only speaking for her mother...she faces him, her back to flor.}
<C>__{john }
<P>__{(looking at flor)}
<D>__{sure you can talk to me..}
<A>__{cristina begins translating as her mother speaks in spanish..}
<C>__{cristina as flor}
<D>__{i don't have to sleep first?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{flor waves the money..cristina waves an empty hand as she speaks for her mother.}
<C>__{cristina as flor}
<D>__{did you give this money to my daughter?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i made this little deal..with all the kids to...}
<C>__{cristina as flor}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{please..}
<A>__{flor advances on him past her daughter so cristina now translates from the background.}
<C>__{cristina as flor }
<D>__{you don't tell or ask the mother when you give a child a fortune for looking on the beach for stones..what is the word for this..}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{sea glass?}
<A>__{on hearing the translation of "sea glass" an exasperated flor turns so that her back is to john as cristina admonishes him.}
<C>__{cristina as flor}
<D>__{no..not a name for the stones..a name for the act..what you did..}
<B>__{on flor..}
<A>__{as she spits out the word to her daughter.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{engreido.}
<B>__{on john..}
<A>__{as his eyes shift to cristina fearing the word he will hear.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh, no..engreido's going to be rough.}
<B>__{on cristina..}
<A>__{reluctantly taking the emotional stance of her mother to deliver the word.}
<C>__{cristina}
<P>__{(briefly being herself)}
<D>__{it's hard to translate.}
<A>__{she takes half a beat..finds the word and now spits it out.}
<C>__{cristina as flor}
<D>__{smug.}
<A>__{john gets up and takes a conciliatory step toward flor so that now cristina is in the middle looking up at them as she translates for john}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i had no idea it would amount to that kind of money..i thought sort of tops fifty dollars.}
<C>__{cristina as flor}
<D>__{fifty dollars is a lot of money..}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{okay. right.}
<A>__{he has no idea where to take it from here the two females look as he searches for the right thing to say..}
<C>__{john }
<P>__{(sighing to himself)}
<D>__{ah, shit..}
<A>__{that fast cristina translates.. before flor can react. john talks directly to flor..quiet,compassionate, a bit beaten.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{i'm sorry....i get why you are upset. it might not look it but i am good at getting things. doing something about it is something else..i was going to talk to you before i actually gave her the money..but maybe i should have checked before i started the whole thing.}
<P>__{(he smiles they don't)}
<D>__{i know what it's like when you feel your kid is being messed with..i get the message. it won't happen again. it's late..i'm sure we'd all like...}
<A>__{flor lets it out...her daughter hard pressed to keep up.}
<C>__{cristina as flor}
<D>__{to what..sleep? if this was small enough to be helped by some little apology, i would be a fool to bring it up..i need to say more no matter what the result. i need to be impolite. you leave someone else's child alone. it's simple, no? it is too easy for children to feel contradictions..it encourages questioning their parents..and that makes them less safe. your wife takes her for rides and changes her hair..you give her money. here..}
<P>__{(this next sentence}
<D>__{cristina translates with alarm and adds her own}
<P>__{question mark.)}
<D>__{take back the money????????????}
<A>__{flor hands john the envelope under her daughter's wrenching gaze. they begin to exit..but flor turns inadvertently bumping into her daughter. her voice softens.}
<C>__{cristina as flor }
<D>__{i did not mean to be angry to you only emotional..}
<A>__{they turn to leave. john speaks with sudden volume and muscle.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what about hypocritical?}
<A>__{cristina turns back..confused..her mother asks her for a translation and she complies.. flor then wearing the same confused expression.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{yeah, you heard me. it's not like you didn't do the same thing...}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(hard on the translation)}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh, yes. so go lecture yourself..you won't need a translator for that one...i mean what am i lately... a recycling bin?..just anyone dump in your garbage and hope i make something useful out of it...}
<A>__{flor is confused and getting pissed but he is moving now and pointing a finger at her.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{yes, you did the same thing...you think i didn't know about altering those outfits for bernie..she tells me her stuff....so, am i missing something? is there a real difference between that and what you are complaining about?}
<A>__{cristina waits for a comeback from her mother to translate..but doesn't get one..instead her mother is a bit mortified and considerably humbled..the pie smack into the face.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{sin diferencia. yo interferi.}
<C>__{cristina as flor}
<D>__{no difference. i interfered.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{okay......i'm still not sure i did the right thing keeping it to myself. it felt disloyal to deborah..but my daughter really needed someone to be kind to her right then..so..so.}
<C>__{cristina as flor}
<D>__{i am very embarrassed. you are very right. hypocrisy..yes.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(something strikes him, he softens, disoriented)}
<D>__{i will tell you, it's pretty wild to say something and have the other person just concede the pointerior i'm dazed here.}
<C>__{cristina as flor}
<D>__{i will leave whenever it is good for you and...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no..no..come on, man..}
<C>__{cristina as flor}
<D>__{but how can i work for you after we talk like this?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you can't quit even if you want to and you know why.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{no..}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yes, you do..}
<A>__{flor is worried as john looks right at her..is he coming on?}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{because then cristina will blame herself for costing you the job...and that guilt...i don't know if you know about guilt..}
<A>__{cristina doesn't have to check with her mother on this one.}
<C>__{cristina}
<D>__{culpa, guilt, si. we know. we are catholics.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(after her daughter's translation)}
<D>__{culpa, si..por dios, si.}
<C>__{cristina}
<P>__{(on her own)}
<D>__{we know.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(big nod)}
<D>__{we know.}
<A>__{john gestures that there is nothing to be done. flor nods.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so, welcome back.}
<A>__{she smiles..gets up..extends her hand..they shake.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{good night, mr. clasky..}
<C>__{cristina}
<D>__{good night as they exit..their backs to john, daughter following mother...flor speaks to her daughter.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(an aside)}
<D>__{no te puedo tener haciendo esto por mi. ahora tengo que aprender ingles.}
<C>__{cristina as flor}
<P>__{(over her shoulder to john as they move)}
<D>__{i can't have you doing this for me. i must learn english now.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{no, dije eso por ti no por john.}
<A>__{that translates to "no, i meant that for you, not john." but cristina does not translate the line. nor..}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you have a wonderful mother.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{que?}
<C>__{cristina}
<D>__{nada.}
