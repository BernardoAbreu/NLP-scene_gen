<L>__{74 alley upper casbah. outside. day.}
<A>__{it is not a song, but a type of spoken chorus, an assembly of young voices, words whispered from the throat, both high and low, and sudden silent pauses. it is monotonous; but it is just such a repetition, always with the same pattern of tones high, low, then, silent that manages to transform itself into a motif, reach an excited pitch, and acquire breadth and solemnity. the sound fills the alleys, rises toward the long rectangle of sky, and moves farther away as if it were meant to be heard by all. the alley is narrow and sloping, with crumbling walls, tufts of grass, and refuse. it is located at the outer periphery of the casbah the countryside is in the background. an algerian is walking with large steps; a five year old child is behind him, moving quickly, stumbling from time to time on the pavement; although he does not cry, occasionally he calls to his father, who proceeds forward, and does not turn around. the chorus arises from behind them. it is incoherent. they stop in front of a door; they have arrived. the door gives way and they enter.}
