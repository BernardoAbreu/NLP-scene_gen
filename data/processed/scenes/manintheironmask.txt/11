<L>__{interior a priest's apartment day}
<A>__{the first of the partying women tumbles inside; she stops short at what she sees. the second and third stumble in after her and they too stop dead still, sobered by what they see. then with a great roar porthos barrels in.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{aaaaaaaramis!! porthos is }
<A>__{he stops dead in his tracks. from the pov of porthos and the women, we see aramis. always the most theological of the musketeers, and ruthlessly brilliant, he is still lean and powerful. and still handsome, or at least he would be; but now he kneels before a single candle at a private altar, wearing sackcloth and ashes in penitent prayer.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{sorry, my dears. you would have enjoyed it too. he's hung like a donkey.}
<C>__{wench 1}
<D>__{so are you.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{really? i haven't been able to see it for fifteen years. go on now, leave his holiness alone. i will bring you back tomorrow when he's in a better mood.}
<A>__{he whacks their bottoms, herding them out, then swaggers to aramis, heaving himself to a seat beside his praying friend.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{please revel with me, aramis, i need my spirits lifted. i'm old, i'm weak, my strength is gone }
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{be quiet, you fat fool. can't you see i'm praying?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i just said you're praying! are you deaf too? i know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.}
<C>__{aramis}
<P>__{(trying to ignore him)}
<D>__{there are more important things than tits.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{really? if you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, i will buy you a new cathedral.}
<A>__{aramis is still trying to pray, but rises to the bait.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{forgiveness.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{forgiveness?}
<A>__{as if in reply, porthos lets rip an enormous rolling fart.}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{forgive me.}
<A>__{aramis' fingers clamp down on the rosary beads, as he tries to keep praying.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{am i forgiven?}
<A>__{aramis abruptly backhands his huge friend. porthos reels backwards, landing in a chair.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{can't you see i'm praying, goddammit?!}
<A>__{porthos raises a foot and kicks the bishop in the balls. aramis staggers back and grabs a chair to throw it; porthos picks up the whole table just as d'artagnan enters.}
<C>__{porthos and aramis}
<D>__{d'artagnan.}
<A>__{porthos tosses the table aside and bear hugs d'artagnan.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{how are you, you skinny little pup!}
<A>__{aramis sets the chair down in embarrassment.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{a simple theological discussion.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{aramis the king wishes to see you.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{still you serve him loyally though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.}
<A>__{aramis lifts d'artagnan's cloak as evidence: near its hem, sure enough, is the remnant of a broken egg.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i see your mind is sharp as ever. the king said, "right away." cut deep and hard, my friends.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{deep and hard, d'artagnan.}
<A>__{d'artagnan clasps porthos' hand, then that of aramis, and leaves, as porthos shakes his head.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{we were all musketeers once, eh? oh, i forgot. for the poor, the ones you were praying for.}
<A>__{he hands a purse to aramis. surprised, even touched, aramis reaches for it. just as he takes the money, porthos throws a haymaker; but aramis sees the sucker punch coming and ducks. suddenly the two old warriors are circling again.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i wonder how athos is doing.}
