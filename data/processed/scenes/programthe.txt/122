<L>__{interior joe's room day}
<A>__{joe finishes packing his bags. he sees a picture of camille on the dresser. picks it up, looks at it a beat, drops it in the trash. he carries his heisman cardboard standup into the shower, pulls out a match and lights it. he watches it catch fire, then grabs his suitcase and walks out of the room. we hold on the burning standup, as flames lick at joe's smile.}
