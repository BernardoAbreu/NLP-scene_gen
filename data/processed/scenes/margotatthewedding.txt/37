<L>__{exterior field night}
<A>__{the three kids lie in the grass and watch through the slats in the fence: the vogler family eats at an outdoor table. a pig turns on a spit over a smoky barbecue. mrs. vogler says something and the kids and mr. vogler laugh. maisy climbs over claude to see better. he feels her breasts press against his back. suddenly he swats crazily at his ear. ingrid is poking him with a blade of grass.}
