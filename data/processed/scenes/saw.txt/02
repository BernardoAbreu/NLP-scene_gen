<T>__{cut to :}
<A>__{the main hall of the gordon residence, back to the earlier flashback of lawrence and alison. this time, we stay with them.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{i am happy. (he walks over to a chair, leaning over it as he puts something down, gets his briefcase ready to go to work. alison stands a few feet behind him, trying her best to get him to react,}
<P>__{to stop the bullshit and end the masquerade.)}
<C>__{alison}
<P>__{(pissed) that is complete bullshit.}
<D>__{id rather you break down and tell me that you hated me. at least thered be some passion in it.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(tired of this, brushing it off as not}
<D>__{that important, like there really is nothing wrong) we can talk about this alter, okay? (he leans in to kiss her,}
<P>__{but she shakes her head. he pauses there.)}
<C>__{alison}
<P>__{(firmly) just leave.}
<A>__{he looks at her for a moment, searching, then slowly turns away and heads out the door.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{goodnight, little girl. (camera pans up closer into the closet, and we a widened blue eye and part of a face}
<P>__{(yet unidentifiable) watching her.)}
<A>__{the closet doors burst open and diana screams. cut back to the main hall where alison stands alone, her head lowered slightly. as soon as she hears the scream she turns and bolts towards her daughters room.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{diana!?}
<A>__{alison gets to just outside the door to her bedroom.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{diana! (opens the door and flips on the light, gasps when she sees a figure covered by a blanket looming over dianas bed. the figure suddenly grabs diana and she screams, struggling against him. alison goes for them.}
<A>__{quick cut to now, in alison and lawrences bedroom. waistline shot of a figure wearing a black coat, black leather gloves and blue jeans, holding a stethoscope. a gun is tucked into his belt and dianas teddy bear tucked under his arm. he saunters over to the gagged and bound diana and alison, on the floor and tied to a corner end of the bed. alison, her eyes streaming tears, struggles and pulls against her bonds to try to get at him but fails. diana keeps crying mommy! over and over again and sobbing. the figure crouches down beside diana, dropping the teddy bear behind her, his face still unseen. he takes the stethoscope and holds the end to dianas chest. the sound of a loud, steady heartbeat is heard. alison screams at him through her gag.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{dont do that! leave her! get away from her!}
<A>__{he pulls away the stethoscope and the heartbeat halts. he reaches with his right hand and pulls from his belt the gun. dianas screams become more desperate, alisons more frantic, more angry. he puts the stethoscope back against dianas chest and moves the gun up and down in front of her, then bringing it up to her mothers head. we hear the heartbeat again, doubled in speed.}
<C>__{alison}
<P>__{(through her gag) keep your motherfucking}
<D>__{hands off of my daughter!}
<A>__{he pulls away the gun and the stethoscope, tucking the gun back into his belt. he reaches down behind diana and picks up the teddy bear. as he does, we catch a brief glimpse of the lower half of his face, but not enough for a clear identification yet. he holds the teddy bear out in front of diana for a moment then tucks it in front of her. he pats her on the head and stands up, moving over to the window. he parts the curtains slightly and leans forward a bit, and we see his face more clearly. it is zep, the orderly from the hospital. cut to static, and then a surveillance video view of the exterior of the gordon home, of the window where zep is standing. the camera zooms in on him and we hear a raspy, male voice speaking.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(vo as we view shot of zep) who are}
<D>__{you little man...i see you...(cut to a television screen with the video of zep in the window. fade back and to the right as we get a view of someones apartment. plastered on the walls are various photographs, which we can barely make out, and a desk in the corner with some recording equipment. as we move further right and hit the window we see detective tapp, leaning over the camera shooting the gordons window, adjusting the view. something about him seems just not right. we cut back to his view from the camera.) does dr. gordon know youre at home with his wife? i know you know something. (his voice goes up a bit louder) what are you doing in there? waiting for the doctor? im waiting for the doctor, too. hmm.}
<A>__{cut to a view over tapps couch of the television with zep on video on the screen. tapp walks over and sits down in front of the television, his back to us.}
<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{i never should have let you go...}
<A>__{camera pans up to a wall of articles, all about the jigsaw killings. it moves quickly and zooms in on each headline we see. jigsaw hunt brings d.a. before judge, missing man discovered at bizarre crime scene screaming is heard then a quick flashback shot of paul in his cage, first struggling against the wire then hanging dead in his cage killer preaching says top cop, psychopath teaches sick life lessons, quick shot of mark going around looking for the code on the walls, with the sound of his screaming over the shot, escape, victim survives maniacs game quick flashback footage of amanda in the interrogation room, then fighting with her mask, and a shot of lawrence watching and listening to her testimony, doctor questioned in case flash of shots of lawrence being questioned by the tapp and sing and then his lawyer. it ends on the flashback shot of tapp looking back at lawrence through the two way glass after amanda tells her story, and the shot slides into a shot of a car pulling up alongside a building.}
<C>__{tapp}
<P>__{(vo, fading, hushed against soundtrack)}
<D>__{i never shouldve let you go...}
<A>__{the car pulls up alongside a building, with lawrence in the passenger seat, and tapp driving. lawrences awkwardness, tapps distrust, and general uncomfortable tension can be easily detected between them.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(pretending like hes trying to be helpful,}
<D>__{really just glad to be out of tapps company) here we are. that was uh, quite an amazing story that poor woman told.}
<P>__{(tapp just nods, says nothing. lawrence}
<D>__{smiles very uncomfortably, gets out}
<P>__{of the car.)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(leaning down and looking back into}
<D>__{the car window.) look, im sorry i cant be of more help to your investigation.}
<C>__{tapp}
<P>__{(nods very slightly) you know, we arrested}
<D>__{a dentist last week who like to play with kids a bit too much. he lived two blocks from here. the sewer lines run under this neighborhood too, doctor.}
<P>__{(hint hint)}
<A>__{lawrence stands straight up, walks away. tapp waits a moment, then drives off. bam into static and then the video from amandas cell. we are not at tapps desk in the police station, watching him obsessively watch the video, staring at the screen, remote control in hand. as he watches, the camera circles around behind the television to give us a better view of our obsessed detective.}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(from the video) hello amanda. you dont}
<D>__{know me, but i know you. i want to play a game. heres what happens if you lose. theres a timer at the back of the device youre wearing. when the timer goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open.}
<A>__{in the background of the station we hear a couple of detectives talking, then sing walks in behind tapp, over to his own desk. he turns, watching tapp watch the screen. tapp stops and rewinds the tape.}
<C>__{sing}
<P>__{(to the other detectives leaving) ill}
<D>__{catch you guys down there. (he reaches}
<P>__{over and gets something off of his desk)}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(from video) think of it like a reverse}
<D>__{bear trap.}
<A>__{tapp fast forwards a bit, hits play.}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(from video) ill show you...}
<A>__{tapp watches closely the demonstration of the timer then the device going off and exploding. sing watches too, not paying as close attention. as soon as it explodes, sing speaks. the look on his face and the tone of his voice indicates his growing concern for his partners obsession over this case.}
<C>__{sing}
<D>__{hey tapp?}
<A>__{tapp doesnt look up, resembles lawrence in the earlier scene when alison and diana came to him to check her room while he was working on his paper.}
<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{mmm?}
<C>__{sing}
<D>__{were gonna go down to the grill, go get a beer. you wanna come?}
<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{i dont think so. thanks anyway.}
<C>__{sing}
<P>__{(figured he might answer as such) you know i always ask. (he puts on his jacket)}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on video) there is only one key...}
<C>__{sing}
<D>__{ill leave you to have fun up here.}
<P>__{(he puts his hands on his hips, watching some more of the video.)}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on video) its in the stomach of your}
<D>__{dead cellmate.}
<C>__{sing}
<P>__{(still trying to reach him, break him}
<D>__{from his obsession groove) hey tapp?}
<P>__{i dont mean for this to be disrespectful...(pause)}
<D>__{maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend.}
<A>__{sing chuckles, hits tapp playfully on the arm, tapp laughs a bit too, but doesnt look up. sing remains grinning a bit. but then tapp continues and rewinds the video a bit.}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on video) its in the stomach of your}
<D>__{dead cellmate.}
<A>__{tapp fast forwards.}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on video) look around, amanda. know}
<D>__{that im not lying. (sing steps off to the right) you better hurry up. (tapp}
<P>__{rewinds again, suddenly pauses)}
<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{wait wait wait, sing!}
<A>__{sing stops, turns.}
<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{get back here!}
<C>__{sing}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{mmm! (he gestures franticly for him}
<P>__{to come over.)}
<C>__{sing}
<P>__{(sighs then comes over) what?}
<A>__{tapp rewinds one second then pauses, holds pencil to the screen to a grafittied wall on the video.}
<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{remember 118th street?}
<C>__{sing}
<P>__{(looks at the screen, thinks a minute)}
<D>__{ah...k2k. that gangs territory was only about four blocks.}
<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{now listen to this.}
<A>__{they listen with the volume up high. over the static, the sound of a fire alarm can just barely be heard in the background. they look at each other. tapp hits stop.}
<C>__{tapp}
<P>__{(looking up at sing) we gotta check}
<D>__{the records from all the fire emergencies that occurred there in the last two weeks. go, right now! mmm!}
<A>__{sing turns and quickly walks off.}
