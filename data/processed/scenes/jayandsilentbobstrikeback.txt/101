<A>__{we start on the street sign, and pan down to a jeep wrangler that pulls up. a gorgeous woman in sunglasses drives, with silent bob sitting in the back seat. after a beat, jay pops up from under the dash, wiping his mouth, looking around. the woman sighs, and zips up her pants. jay and bob hop out and wave to the woman as the car pulls away. bob offers jay a look.}
