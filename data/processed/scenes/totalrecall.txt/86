<L>__{interior quail's hotel room night}
<A>__{quail enters, turns on the lights, locks the door. he checks all the rooms. then he crosses to the dresser, studies himself in the mirror. he looks haggard. quail opens a drawer, takes out his "emergency case," sets it on top and opens it. he removes a shoulder holster and pistol, sets them aside. he takes out a tape recorder. he sets the recorder down gingerly, as if somewhere in there were contained the answers to all his questions. he's just about to activate it, when he hears a knock at the door. quail freezes. another knock.}
<C>__{voice }
<P>__{(through door)}
<D>__{mr. hauser...}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{who is it?}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{mr. hauser, i want to talk to you... about douglas quail.}
<A>__{quail ditches the recorder and the "emergency case" into the drawer everything except the pistol. quail approaches the door very cautiously (from the side out of the line of fire).}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(tensely)}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{my name is george edgemar. i work for rekall, incorporated.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(stunned; incredulous)}
<D>__{rekall??}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{yes. it's difficult to explain... could you open the door, please? i'm not armed.}
<A>__{quail opens it carefully, his gun at the ready, but out of view of the person at the door. a dignified looking gentleman stands there, calm and pleasant, wearing an earth style business suit.}
<C>__{edgemar}
<D>__{hello, mr. quail. may i come in? i won't be offended if you prefer to keep the gun you're holding trained on me.}
<A>__{he can't see the gun, but somehow knows.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{all right... come in.}
<A>__{quail does keep his gun trained on the man. the man enters, holding in his outstretched hand a business card.}
<C>__{edgemar}
<D>__{my card, mr. quail.}
<A>__{quail frisks him, then takes the card, glances at it.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{okay so you're doctor george edgemar of 'rekall, inc.' so?}
<C>__{edgemar}
<D>__{as i said... this is going to be very difficult for both of us.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{i'm listening.}
<C>__{edgemar}
<D>__{mr. quail... i'm afraid you're not really standing here at this moment.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{sat that again.}
<C>__{edgemar}
<D>__{i said, you're not really here. neither am i. we're both in the memory studio in the offices of rekall, inc. on earth.}
<A>__{long pause.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{are you trying to tell me that this is all part of some... artificially injected fantasy? that i never really left earth?}
<C>__{edgemar}
<D>__{no, not quite. we didn't give you this. you're creating it yourself }
<P>__{(pauses, choosing his words)}
<D>__{remember the option we offered you? intelligence agent? something inside you liked that idea, fastened on it. what you're experiencing now is a free form delusion that you yourself are fabricating.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{what is this shit you're giving me?}
<C>__{edgemar}
<D>__{this is not shit, mr. quail. it's the truth.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i know it's very hard for you to accept, but you're having a schizophrenic reaction... we can't snap you out of the narkadine. you're in a world of your own fantasy.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{then how the hell can you be in my dream if you know it's just a dream?}
<C>__{edgemar}
<D>__{i've been artificially implanted like the first part of your fantasy. i'm actually monitoring your dream at a psychoprobe console. this is a last resort. when somebody gets stuck in their own fantasy, we send in someone after them. a specialist, like myself.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{i don't believe a word you're saying.}
<C>__{edgemar}
<D>__{i was afraid you'd think that. i'm sorry to have to do this, but you really are stuck.}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{doctor noel, would you come in now please?}
<A>__{the door starts to open. quail pivots and points his gun at the opening door. melina walks in, carrying a clipboard. she looks at quail with professional detachment.}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{yes, mr. quail, i'm afraid it's all true.}
<A>__{quail is staggered.}
<C>__{melina}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i tried to break through to you earlier, but you just molded me into your fantasy. sometimes it takes dr. edgemar to get through to a client as tough as you.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(wavering)}
<D>__{so what's supposed to happen now?}
<C>__{edgemar}
<D>__{just do exactly as we tell you.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(stares at him coldly)}
<D>__{somehow that doesn't appeal to me.}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{please, mr. quail... try to cooperate. you're having a schizophrenic embolism.}
<C>__{edgemar}
<D>__{if we can't get you out now... you may never come out of it. your wife calls every day }
<A>__{close quail even more suspicious. two shot quail and edgemar}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{if this is a fantasy, there'll be no real consequences when i pull this trigger.}
<C>__{edgemar}
<D>__{but there will by consequences inside your mind. consequences that won't hurt me... but could be fatal to you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if you shoot me, you'll wipe me out of your fantasy i can't come back again. because to you, i will be dead. i can't help you get back to reality. you'll be stuck in permanent psychosis.}
<A>__{close quail trembling, holding the gun point blank in edgemar's face. close edgemar showing no fear of tension whatever.}
<C>__{edgemar}
<D>__{you're going to lower the gun, mr. quail. you're going to hand it to me }
<A>__{close quail straining desperately to find the true "reality."}
