<L>__{interior knights inn restaurant night}
<A>__{a medieval themed biergarten. a happy family of five sits at a booth, singing along to "good king wencelas." in the booth beside, merlin and pug are holding court. merlin's puffing smoke rings. pug watches dully, chewing:}
<C>__{pug}
<D>__{knew a guy in joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. his lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x ray.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{that right? shit. i used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. you ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?}
<A>__{the happy family stops singing. pug considers, spits a wad.}
<C>__{pug}
<D>__{hell. the guy from joliet, those black ass lungs were the least of his problems. got so much smoke in him his lungs couldn't even hold it. got into his system, man. into his blood. coming out his ears, man, coming out his eyes. guy'd be walking the row, smoke'd be puffing out his skin.}
<A>__{the happy family trade discomfited looks. merlin shrugs, takes another drag.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{this trucker? met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. he's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. his tongue. sucks it right down.}
<C>__{pug}
<D>__{my guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{his lips went nexterior you ever see some silicon fucking lips?}
<A>__{the happy family flees their booth. pug and merlin glance over. and grab their leftovers. rifling the grub:}
<C>__{merlin}
<P>__{(with disgust)}
<D>__{vegetarians...}
<A>__{behind them, gabriel and jumpy file into the biergarten, leading rudy and ashley to the booth. meeting commenced. rudy, battered and freezer burnt, gets shoved in first. gabriel throws down the casino map:}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{start singing.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i have no gifts to bring, pa rumpum pum pum}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{sing it in pictures, nick.}
<A>__{rudy takes the map, glances at ashley, and then takes charge. for the first time, he's giving the orders:}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{what you gotta worry about first is the guards. place doesn't look much richer than when i worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. there'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. eyes in the sky. they see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{how do we take them out?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you gotta get someone upstairs.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{how do we do that?}
<A>__{rudy takes the map, points to the gaming tables area:}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. keypad access.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{what's the code?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{uh... they change it every month. i wouldn't know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. you gotta draw 'em out.}
<C>__{pug}
<D>__{without having them hit the alarms.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i got an idea on that one. once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. there's a security camera room that videotapes everything. you've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{what about the money?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you lock down security, you move behind the cage. you hit the count room. there'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. cashiers'll know it. they'll have alarms.}
<C>__{jumpy}
<D>__{what about the powwow safe?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jumpy}
<D>__{the powwow safe. the secret safe. you said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{oh. right. yeah. that's, uh upstairs. uh. here. powwow safe.}
<A>__{his confident manner wavers. gabriel notices, narrows his eyes. rudy quickly grabs the map again:}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{so. you're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. you're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you need six.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{we got five. putting ashley outside.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you need six.}
<A>__{gabriel eyes him darkly.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. you need six.}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{six is me.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you guys get caught, i go away for good. i got an interest in making sure you don't. you need a sixth man covering an exit. what're you gonna do about it.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{yeah. what're you gonna do about it.}
<A>__{she puts an arm around rudy, smiles. that's her man.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i want a map of that security level. every room, every guard, every thing.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{six men means six guns.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i'm no threat without a gun.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{no, you're not.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{there'll be people in that casino. i can't keep them from leaving if i don't get a gun. i don't need bullets, monster... but i gotta be a threat.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{what's the matter, gabriel? this is what you wanted him for, isn't it?}
<A>__{gabriel's eyes don't leave rudy's.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{no gun.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{well. what you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{that part, nick... was planned out the day i read your letters.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{what. we all gonna dress up like cowboys?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{not cowboys, nick. not cowboys.}
<A>__{gabriel smiles.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{not on christmas eve.}
