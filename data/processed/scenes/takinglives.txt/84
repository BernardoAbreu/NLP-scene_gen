<A>__{ultra hip. the dance floor throbs with clubgoers. the dj thumps a eurobeat. costa sits at the bar. people all around him, jostling to buy drinks. two busy bartenders sling booze. costa finds the noise and crowd absolutely nerve wracking. he twirls the ice in his scotch with a finger. staring at the clock. 1:31 am. he's nervous, sweat beads his forehead. a big bartender, an undercover cop, pours costa a scotch.}

<A>__{costa scratches around the neck of the hot body armor. the bartender gives him a dasani. various angles: a half dozen undercovers are mixed in with the clubgoers. camera finds reynaud sitting at the bar near costa, gives costa a reassuring nod through the crowd.}
