<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{love you.}
<A>__{they all hug. bobby and jalisa walk away arm in arm, singing.}
<D>__{bobby jalisa i saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, i saw the sign...}
<A>__{zoe turns to lock up. while her back is turned, stan appears from the shadows.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{aahhh!}
<A>__{zoe screams and drops the keys. nuts, overexcited by zoe's reaction, starts to run wheel in circles and then tips over.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{you scared the hell out of me!}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{oh, wow. is he...okay?}
<A>__{nuts is still on the ground, his wheels spinning. zoe sets him upright.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't mean to scare you. or hurt your dog. don't worry, i'm not a stalker.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{how'd you know i worked here?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i followed you after the subway.}
<P>__{(thinks, then)}
<D>__{that sounds a little stalkery, huh?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i just really wanted to see you again. almost like i had to see you again. can i walk you home?}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{is it me or does everything i say make me sound more like a stalker?}
<A>__{zoe allows a small smile.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{can i just give you my card? here. take my card. i'm not a freak. really. i sell cheese.}
<A>__{this hangs out there for a beat.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{cheese?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{yeah. my family has a goat farm. we make cheese. you like cheese?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i guess. i've never really thought about it.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{little goat. maybe you've seen us at the farmer's market? come by sometime and you can taste my cheese.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{okay, i'm going to go. this has not gone as planned.}
<A>__{stan smiles meekly and then turns to go.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{stan lifts his hand to wave but doesn't even turn around. clearly, he feels like an idiot. zoe watches him go.}
