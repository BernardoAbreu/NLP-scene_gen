<A>__{ben makes his way down the cramped, dimly lit stairway and approaches the door to the basement room. he raises his hand to knock, then hesitates and stands there for a moment listening to the muffled voices inside. suddenly he is grabbed from behind and slammed up against the door by enormous bobby. bobby slams him against the door a couple of more times, using ben's head as a doorknocker. the door is opened by someone inside and enormous bobby shoves ben into the room.}
