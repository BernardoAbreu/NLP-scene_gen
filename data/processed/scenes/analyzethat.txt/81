<L>__{interior patty's kitchen continuous action}
<A>__{vitti enters. patty lopresti, mid forties, still sexy even in an apron, is mixing cake batter in a bowl with an electric mixer.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{paul what a nice surprise.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{how's it goin', patty?}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{good. it's good. give me a kiss, you.}
<A>__{patty hugs and kisses him, taking the opportunity to pat him down for a weapon or a hidden wire.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{sorry to hear about carmine. he was a good man.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{yeah. you live with a person twenty one years, then one day they're pulling his torso out of the river. it's hard.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i will bet especially with all the talk about you being the one who put him there.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{that's why i try not to gossip, paul. it's ugly. just a sec.}
<P>__{(screaming to ceiling)}
<D>__{michelle! teresa! it's ten thirty! stop fucking around and get ready for ballet!}
<P>__{(to vitti)}
<D>__{it's hard being a single parent and a career woman.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{yeah, i'm sure you're very busy.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{the pressure it's awful. for instance, a lot of people think, now that you're out, you're going to try and take the family back from me. but i said, no, paul would never do that.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{by the way, how are marie and the kids? still in ohio? in shaker heights? at 1356 locust?}
<A>__{vitti explodes, reaches across the counter and grabs her by the shoulders.}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(enraged)}
<D>__{you even go near them, you crazy bitch }
<C>__{patty}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{don't make me call my guys in. you may need the shit kicked out of you, but not in here. i just mopped.}
<A>__{vitti lets her go.}
<C>__{patty}
<P>__{(smoothing clothes,}
<D>__{flushed and a little}
<P>__{excited)}
<D>__{wow. have you been working out?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{yeah, i been workin' out who's trying to kill me. i'd love to hear your thoughts on that.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{it's a dog eat dog world out there. nobody's gonna be safe unless we can end this thing with the rigazzis.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{so then you didn't have nothin' to do with it.}
<C>__{patty}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{oh, paul. you actually think i would kill you? all the years we've known each other the christmas parties, the fun times at the beach. it wouldn't be right. i want us to be friends.}
<P>__{(smiles demurely)}
<D>__{who knows? maybe we'll be more than friends. want to lick my beaters?}
<A>__{she holds the beaters out to him.}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(declining)}
<D>__{thanks. i gotta see a guy about a business thing.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{what kind of business? you know, if you get something going, we would expect some kind of consideration a little taste.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{no, this is a legitimate business.}
<C>__{patty}
<P>__{(shudders)}
<D>__{oh, paul. i just got a chill.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i just want to be left alone. put my life back together straight up this time. put the word out, will ya? nobody's got nothin' to worry about from me.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{sure, paul. i understand.}
<A>__{he heads for the door.}
<C>__{patty}
<P>__{(calls after him)}
<D>__{don't be a stranger!}
<A>__{after vitti leaves, eddie enters from the other door.}
<C>__{patty}
<P>__{(turning to eddie)}
<D>__{watch him like a hawk. if he steps out of line, it would break my heart, but shoot him in the fuckin' head.}
