<A>__{data is sitting in a chair, petting spot the cat. geordi is standing next to him.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{is she still angry?}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{no... but i'd stay out of sickbay for a while if i were you. i still don't know why you dropped her in the water.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i was attempting to... get in the spirit of things. i thought it would be humorous.}
<A>__{data frowns. troubled by this recent experience. he puts spot down and moves to a bulkhead. he activates a control panel and a small compartment slides open, revealing a small computer chip which is suspended in a glass and metal framework. data looks at the chip for a beat and geordi moves to him in concern.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{data... you're not thinking about using that thing are you?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{it has occurred to me on several occasions. but i believe this may be the appropriate time.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{wait a minute. i thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{that is true. however, i believe my growth as an artificial life form has reached an impasse. for thirty four years i have endeavored to become more "human" to grow beyond my original programming. and yet i am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor.}
<P>__{(re: chip)}
<D>__{this emotion chip is the only answer.}
<A>__{geordi considers a moment, looks at the chip... and reluctantly has to agree.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{all right...}
<A>__{data sits down and la forge moves to stand behind him.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{but at the first sign of trouble, i'm going to deactivate it. agreed?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{agreed.}
<A>__{geordi works on data's head for a moment, and then opens a panel on data's head, revealing the blinking circuitry within.}
