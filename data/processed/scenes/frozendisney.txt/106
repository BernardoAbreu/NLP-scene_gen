<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{what? that's not a thing.}

<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{...i could. i mean i'd like to. i'd... may i? we me....i mean, may we? wait, what?}
<A>__{she gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{we may.}
<A>__{he smiles and goes for it. it's a true love's kiss, alright. we move past them to find olaf enjoying the summer. with his snow cloud safely overhead, he's free to smell the flowers, which he does. then sneezes his carrot nose off. sven catches it between his teeth. olaf gasps as sven sucks the whole carrot into his mouth. it's gone. olaf's face sinks in sadness. but not to fear, sven spits the carrot back out and jams it into olaf's face where it belongs. it's completely covered in reindeer spit, but olaf doesn't seem to mind. he hugs sven happily.}
