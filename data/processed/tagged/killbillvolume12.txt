(a sog is a long, double edged knife that's as sharp as a razor, and is what navy seals use to kill humans with.) the bride backs up into the mess of the now totally demolished living room. the two woman stalk each other, each holding her blade, each looking like they know how to use it, each waiting for the other to make a mistake so they can plunge their blade deep into the other one. blood and sweat dript off of the faces of the two women locked in life and death combat...... ....when the back kitchen door opens, and a four year old little girl, carrying a lunch box steps inside.}

<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{well that's a demonstration of bill's complete ignorance when it comes to the subject of me, and what i'm thinking, and what i might do. it's mercy, compassion, and forgiveness i lack, not rationality.}
<A>__{she pauses for effect the ham.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{i will wait for now, but i won't wait for long. i will allow you to choose a time and place for us to meet again, preferably as far away from nikki as possible. i could have just hit you, i didn't, i demand respect for that. since this is not a hit, consider it a duel. and as two former deadly vipers, we will observe viper rules of honor. one on one no help no bushwhackin no treacherous weapons on weapon of choice our skill and our bodies.}

<D>__{ bitch, you can stop right there.}
<A>__{the b word stops vernita short, almost like a cold handed slap in the face (it should affect the audience that way as well).}
<C>__{the bride}
<P>__{(leans in close)}
<D>__{just because i have no wish to murder you before the eyes of your daughter, does not mean parading her around in front of me is going to inspire sympathy. you and i have unfinished business. and not a goddamn fuckin thing you've done in the subsequent five years including getting knocked up is going to change that.}
<C>__{vernita}
<D>__{you have every right to wanna get even }
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{ but that's where you're wrong, vernita. i don't want to get even. to get even, even steven. i would have to kill you, go into nikki's room, kill her, then wait for your old man, dr. bell, to come home and kill him. that would make us even. no, my unborn daughter will just hafta be satisfied with your death at her mother's hands.}
<A>__{vernita knows no matter what else is said, blood will spill.}

<C>__{the bride}

<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{what praytell, is a ten point palm exploding heart technique?}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{quite simply, the deadliest blow in all of the martial arts. he hits you with his fingertips, at ten different pressure points on your body. and then, he lets you walk away. but once you've taken five steps, your heart explodes inside your body, and you fall to the floor dead.}

<D>__{no. he teaches no one the ten point palm exploding heart technique. but he is nietzsche's psalm personified. if pai mei doesn't kill you, he will make you stronger. now one of the things i always liked about you, kiddo, is you appear wise beyond your years. then allow me to impart, a word to the wise. whatever what ever pai mei says, obey. if you flash him even for an instant a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out. and if you throw any american sass his way, he will snap your back and your neck like they were twigs, and that will be the story of you.}

<A>__{the bride's face shows determination. not to win, not even to land a blow, that she knows is impossible. this man's ability is truly amazing. however be that as it may, she's determined not to quit, and through not quitting, she's determined to distinguish herself in his eyes...in some way. she takes the sword from him and tries again. but this time, pai mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the sword, manipulating it into positions that would do the young girl harm...like bringing the blade up against her other arm...poised to cut it off.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{that blade's sharp. careful not to cut off your own arm.}

<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{now that really would be a shame.}
<A>__{he takes the sword from her grasp... swings once... the blades's against her jugular. he swings twice... the blade's against the pocket of her throat. he swings a third time... the blade's against the nipple of her right breast.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{your swordsmanship is amateur at best.}
<A>__{he tosses the sword in the air, catching it by the tip of the blade. then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on the top of the bride's head. she lets out a howl, and falls to the floor, holding the lump on her noggin.}

<D>__{...pathetic.....terrible...you idiot, you should've landed that blow...you call that crane?... enough, i grow bored.}
<A>__{with little effort on his part, he reaches out and grabs her wrist, twists...she's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in the air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers. he could literally break her arm in half.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{i asked you to show me what you know, and you did. not a goddamn thing.}
<A>__{he twists her wrist... ...the pain is excruciating.....}
<C>__{pai mei}

<D>__{she told me later, that the second she lifted up her foot and saw him not flapping, she knew he was dead. is that not the perfect visual image of life and death? a fish flapping on the carpet, and a fish not flapping on the carpet. so powerful even a five year old child with no concept of life and death knew what it meant. not only did she know emilio was dead, she knew she had killed him. so she comes running into my room, holding emilio in both of her little hands it was so cute and she wanted me to make emilio better. and i asked her, why did she step on emilio? and she said, she didn't know. but i knew why. you didn't mean to hurt emilio, you just wanted to see what would happen if you stepped on him, right?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{and what happens when you stomp on emilio, is you kill him. and you discovered that, didn't you?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{so we drove down to the beach, had a little funeral, and gave emilio a burial at sea. and right now i'm sure he's happy as can be, swimmin around in fish heaven. but the point being, our child learned two very important lessons. one, about life and death. the other, somethings once you do, they can't be undone. i knew just how she felt}
<P>__{(to b.b.)}
<D>__{you loved emilio, didn't you?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{bill}

<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{did you want to see what would happen?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no, i knew what would happen to mommy if i shot her. what i didn't know, is when i shot mommy, what would happen to me.}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i was very sad. and that was when i learned, somethings once you do, they can never be undone.}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{what happened to mommy?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{why don't you ask mommy.}
<C>__{b.b.}

<A>__{bill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house drinking a glass of red wine. the steps lead to the beach and the sea. beatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps across from him. between them the dawn sky breaks.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{did she go to sleep easy?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{it took her a little bit. she was excited. she's quite the little chatterbox.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, if she doesn't like you, you got to kill her to say hello. but if she likes you, you can't shut her up. she's a chip off the ole blonde in that regards.}
<A>__{he holds up the bottle of vino.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{red wine?}
<A>__{she shakes her blonde head, no.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{c'mon, bea, you're a whole lot more fun with a couple glasses of wine in ya.}
<A>__{she gives him a look.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(pointing towards the beach)}
<D>__{we're going to go out there and have at it, aren't we?}
<A>__{she shakes her blonde head, yes.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, i've already had a glass. so unless you want to win by an unfair advantage, you should have a glass of wine. so we're both on the same footing wine wise.}
<A>__{she holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you know, there's an old man down here, his name is esteban viharo. he was a pimp. i knew him when i was a child. he was a friend of my mother's. i told him about you. when i showed him your picture he smiles and said;}
<P>__{(imitating his accent)}
<D>__{"yesss, i see the attraction." he told me a story about taking me to the movies when i was five. it was a movie which had lana turner in it. and whenever she would appear on screen, he said i would stick my thumb in my mouth and suck it, to an obscure amount. and he knew right then, this boy will be a fool for blondes.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{who would of ever thought you'd be such a good father?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well not you, that's for damn sure.}
<A>__{she gives him another look.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{must we have to endure your little zingers?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no we mustn't. but if you're going to say sentences like that, in the future, i will resist the temptation.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{baby, you don't have a future.}
<A>__{bill drinks some wine.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i sent you to l.a. and you never came back. i thought you'd been killed. do you know how cruel it is to make someone think someone they love is dead? i mourned you. then in the third month of my mourning, i track you down. i wasn't trying to track you down, i was trying to track down the fucking assholes who i thought killed you. and when i find you, what to i find? not only are you not dead, you're getting married to some fuckin jerk and you're pregnant? how do you expect me to react?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{why do you think i hid?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{why did you leave in the first place? you have cold eyes towards me now. i understand their temperature, but they were warm the second to the last time i saw them, or was that just my imagination?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{the bride decides to tell all. as she tells this story, parts will be shown on the screen. to give herself a running start with the story she starts it off in japanese;}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{you sent me to l.a. to kill that lady scoundrel, lisa wong.}
<A>__{bill interrupts her.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{you are you talking in japanese?}
<A>__{the bride explodes;}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{what the hell do you care what i talk in? don't you know when to keep your mouth shut? i'm trying to tell you what you want to know, if you'll just shut up and listen and stop talking! now may i continue?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you're right, i'm wrong, continue.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{the morning i left, i threw up. i don't feel like speaking in japanese anymore on the plane, i threw up. when i got to my hotel, i threw up. so naturally i started thinking, maybe i might be pregnant. so i bought one of those home pregnancy kits. went back to my room and took the test. the little strip said blue. i was going to have a baby. i tried to call you, but you weren't there, so i just thought i'd call back later.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{but you never did.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{ would you shut up, i'm trying to tell you how i feel.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{my apologies, please continue.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{so i just figured i'd call you back later. i was just so happy, i put on music and danced by myself in the hotel suite, holding my little blue strip. what i didn't know, was at some leg of my journey, i was spotted. with me in los angeles it didn't take lisa wong long to figure out someone put a hit out on her. so she sent an assassin of her own to kill me in my hotel room. as i was dancing in euphoria, the killer came down the hall.}
<A>__{there's a knock on the hotel room door. the bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole. peephole pov: a pretty korean woman in the blazer and skirt outfit of a hotel manager. she's holding a basket of flowers. the bride says through the door;}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{hello, can i help you?}
<C>__{hotel woman}
<D>__{hello, i'm karen kim, i'm the hospitality manager of the hotel. i have a welcome gift from the management.}
<A>__{seeing it through the peephole.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{oh, it's beautiful. but i'm kinda busy at this second, could you possibly come back later?}
<A>__{as she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she bends down to pick it up...}
<B>__{when...}
<A>__{a shotgun blast blows a hole in the door, right where the bent over woman was previously standing. karen kicks open the door, pump action shotgun in hand. the bride's on her back, on the floor below her. karen aims the shotgun down at her. with her foot, the bride kicks the front door. it slams back hitting karen in the face. the bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover. karen pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and fires the shotgun the bride's way. the bride dives out of the way. the blast destroys the side of the room it hits. the bride comes up from the floor with her sog in her hand, and throws it across the room at karen... karen blocks the thrown knife with her shotgun. the blade sticking in the weapon's wooden stock. she removes the knife, and drops it to the floor. the bride is a sitting duck. there's nothing she can do except wait to get shot.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{so you came here to kill lisa wong, huh? well that's my sister, bitch. i'm karen wong, and i've come here to kill you.}
<A>__{she raises the shotgun, and takes aim at the bride...}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{wait a second!}
<A>__{karen stops.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yes, i'm an assassin. yes i did come here to kill your sister. but i'm not gonna do that now.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{oh, i know you're not }
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{ listen to me! i just found out, right now not two minutes before you blew a hole in the door, i'm pregnant.}
<A>__{karen looks at her, "what?".}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{on that table is the home pregnancy kit. on the floor by the door is the strip that says i'm pregnant. i'm telling you the truth, i don't want to and i won't kill your sister. i just want to go home.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what is this, bullshit story number twelve in the female assassin's handbook?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{any other time you'd be a hundred percent right. but this time you're a hundred percent wrong. i'm the deadliest woman in the world, but right now i'm scared shitless for my baby. please, you hafta believe me. look at the strip, it's on the floor.}
<A>__{karen looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the floor.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{sit down on that bed and put your hands behind your head.}
<A>__{the bride complies. karen bends down and picks the strip off the floor. then takes the package it came in and reads the directions on the box.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{blue means pregnant.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i will read it myself, thank you.}
<A>__{it is blue, karen's starting to believe her.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{okay, say i were to believe you, what then?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{just go home. i will do the same.}
<A>__{karen does...she starts backing out of the room...before she leaves, she says;}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you fucked with the wong sisters.}
<B>__{back on the porch}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{facing karen wong, was the most frightening moment i have ever experienced. and that includes three years with that evil bastard pai mei. before that strip turned blue, i was a woman, i was your woman. i was a killer, who killed for you. before that strip turned blue, i would have jumped a motorcycle on to a speeding train ...for you. but once that strip turned blue, i could no longer do any of those things. not anymore. because now i was a mother. a mother who only had one thought on her mind. please don't harm my baby. can you understand that?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{yes. but why tell me now, and not then?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{you wouldn't have let me go. specially once you found out i was pregnant. you would've tried to talk me out of it. it would have been a big scene. i just said fuck it.}
<A>__{starting to get mad.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{fuck who?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{bill, you couldn't know i was pregnant, once you knew, you'd claim it, and i didn't want that.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that's not your decision to make.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yes, but it's the right decision. and i made it for my daughter. everybody on this earth deserves to start with a clean slate. but with us my daughter would be born into a world she shouldn't be. robbing her of the one thing everybody deserves. she would be born with blood stains. i had to choose. i chose her.}
<A>__{she takes a sip of wine. it's morning now. and now it's her turn.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{you know five years ago, if i had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen. you performing a coup de grace on me by bustin a cap in my crown, would be right at the top of the list.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'd've been wrong, wouldn't i?}
<A>__{bill listens stoney, then;}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'm sorry was that a question? of impossible things that could never happen yes in this instance you would have been wrong.}
<A>__{the bride listens stoney, then;}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well what?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{explain yourself.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i already have. when i told you the story of when i thought you were dead. didn't you get how badly i felt?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{you call that an explanation?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well if that's too cryptic let's get literal.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there are consequences to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard. you experienced some of them.}
<A>__{that's his explanation. she hears it. they both understand one another.}
<C>__{the bride}

<D>__{yes.}

<D>__{you know i was rooting for you, don't you?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{i figured.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you know on that beach out there i want you to be the victor?}
<A>__{she nods her head, yes.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you also know you're going to have to defeat me. i can't just give it to you, even though i want to.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{it won't be necessary for you to give me anything. i've surpassed you. i will take it.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, as they say in missouri, show me.}
<L>__{exterior the beach morning}
<A>__{as the blue waves of the gulf of mexico crash on the beach, the bride in her bridal gown, and bill, his tuxedo jacket off, face each other in a combat stance. the bride breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her hanzo sword in its sheath.}

<A>__{stares across the sand to the figure of the bride, his student, facing him at sunrise with a weapon he taught her to use. this is where all who teach combat artistry may end up. facing a frankenstein monster of their own creation. he removes his hanzo sword from its sheath with great flourish.}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{the two combatants...quite far from each other...they intend to charge attack...stand in showdown stance. the bride the vengeance theme explodes on the soundtrack. she takes her combat stance. but what she doesn't do is remove her sword from its wood sheath. the fist of her left hand is wrapped around the wood sheath's center. her right empty hand, raises and makes a beckoning gesture to bill. then with a face completely devoid of emotion, says in japanese;}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{attack me.}
<A>__{she's facing him, sword in sheath, hand far from handle, in a standing still position, not moving a muscle of blinking an eye, staring her laser beams in bill's direction waiting for his attack. he stands in a combat position, sword raises in a combat grip, to charge her.}

<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{that's my girl.}
<A>__{he screams a samurai scream...and charges her... she stands motionless... unblinking... watching him coming... no fear.... no expression... we go back and forth, close, wide, low.}
<B>__{till...}
<A>__{they meet... using only her left arm, with the sheathed hanzo sword in its grip, she blocks all of his blows, right arm unmoving down at her side...sort of like pai mei did to her earlier...his sword and her sheath lock together...they're close to each other, she brings up her right arm, sticks out two fingers, and hits bill on ten different pressure points on his body. then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm. his body jolts, like he's just had a heart attack...he coughs up a little blood...he looks at her. their faces are very close... the face of the cold ice woman ninja, melts away before our eyes, and the face of beatrix kiddo is filled once again with compassion.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he taught you the ten point palm exploding heart technique?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{of course he did.}

<D>__{i don't know...because...i'm a...bad person.}
<A>__{he smiles at her duplicitly, and says with blood on his lips;}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no. you're not a bad person. you're a terrific person. you're my favorite person. but every once in awhile...you can be a real cunt.}
<A>__{they smile at each other. then... bill turns his back to her... and walks five steps in the opposite direction...with each step his heart swells, on the fifth... it bursts...we hear a sound, like of a tire blowout... he falls to the beach...dead. the bride walks over to his body. she unsheaths her hanzo sword. blood lies in a pool, by bill's mouth. she dips the tip of the blade in the blood, leaving the tiniest of crimson smudges. she then removes the bill handkerchief, and wipes bill's blood from off the blade onto the white cloth. she lets the bill handkerchief drop onto his body. the jingi sword hattori hanzo created, just for her, for this purpose, has come to the end of its journey. beatrix, in a moment of enormous generosity, allows herself, one final tear, shed for her corrupter, her enemy, the father of her child,...her man. the tear is for her as well. for she's very aware she will never ever be completely any other man's woman. ex cu the hanzo blade slowly sliding into the wood sheath. ex cu the single teardrop, sliding down her cheek. the blade disappears inside the sheath. the teardrop falls of her chin. her journey, her revenge, her victory, her unfinished business, is completed. the bride exits the beach. bill doesn't.}
