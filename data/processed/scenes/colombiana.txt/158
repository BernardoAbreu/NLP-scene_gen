<L>__{interior villa night}
<A>__{the head of security goes around the villa checking that all the doors and windows are secure. his men are posted outside the door to the bedroom, on the stairs, in the salon. he closes lights as he goes. he walks across the aquarium floor in the foyer to the front door, closes the lights, so that only the glow from the aquarium lights illuminate the dark. and he exits, closing the door behind him, turning the lock.}
<B>__{close on the aquarium}
<A>__{the sharks gliding back and forth. and then, a figure in a black wet suit, fins and a mask, with a small back back, comes gliding into through the sharks. who just go about their business. the figure stops at the edge of the glass floor, takes something out of the back pack and very skillfully cuts a small hole in one of the glass panels that makes up the floor. the diver lifts out of the aquarium, pulls back the wet suit. it is cat. cat opens the backpack, removes a silencer fitted pistol.}
<B>__{close on the bedroom doors opening}
<A>__{cat enters, silent, closes the door, approaches the bed where william is asleep sandwiched between the three passed out girls. empty champagne bottles and glasses are strewn about. cat stares down at the scene, points her gun at william. one of the girls rolls over onto william, ruining her shot. she hesitates. close on william's face as sits up suddenly, startled from sleep. no one is in the room. he looks around, and notices the bedroom door ajar. he is more awake now, sees the nymphettes sleeping soundly. he rises, dressed in a silk sleeping robe. he feels something on his chest, goes over to the mirror, opens his gown and sees, painted on his chest: in red lipstick, the word thief, and a drawing of a cataleya orchid. panic starts to set in.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{no answer. william tip toes to the ajar door. he peeks out and sees two guards with bullets through their foreheads, blood leaked out across the white marble floor. really panicked, he flattens himself against the inside of the door, his breath coming in gasps.}
