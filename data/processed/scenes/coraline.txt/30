<A>__{other mother sets down a huge, roasted chicken near coraline on a table spread with candles, fine china and silver and a pineapple centerpiece. figure eight model train tracks circle twin lazy susans covered in dishes of potatoes, sweet peas, rolls, and corn. the other father seals this norman rockwell moment by making prayer hands and a solemn face.}
<C>__{other father}
<D>__{we give our thanks and ask to bless, our mother's golden chicken breast!}
<A>__{he laughs with glee then a starting bell rings and it's time to eat. other father really digs in while coraline tries some chicken.}

<D>__{d'you have any gravy?}
<C>__{other mother}
<D>__{well, here comes the gravy train! choo choo!}
<A>__{other mother giggles as a model train circles round the track, pulling a gravy boat car and blowing its whistle. the train goes in one side of the centerpiece and comes out the other, slowing till the gravy boat lines up with coraline's plate, where it pours gravy on her potatoes.}
<C>__{other mother}
<D>__{another roll, sweet peas? corn on the cob?}
<A>__{other mother looks on approvingly, not touching any food herself.}

<C>__{other mother}
<D>__{of course! any requests?}
<A>__{a beautiful chandelier drink dispenser descends.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{mango milk shake?}
<A>__{the dispenser spins, stops and fills her glass while other mother presents dessert: a cake with candles that pop up and light themselves while the words "welcome home!" write themselves in icing. coraline is taken aback.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{home?}
<A>__{her other parents squeeze each other's hands warmly.}
<C>__{other mother}

<D>__{really?}
<C>__{other mother}
<D>__{uh huh, and soon as you're through eating, i thought we'd play a game.}

<C>__{other mother}
<D>__{perfect! hide and seek in the rain.}
