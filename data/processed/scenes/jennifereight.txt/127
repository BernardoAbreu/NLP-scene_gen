<L>__{126: interior interrogation room. police station. day.}
<A>__{a change of chairs. a wood chair for the subject. mobile chair for the man. castors give him considerable freedom. enable him to back off or move in with the intimacy of an ophthalmologist.}
<D>__{st anne you fish, john?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i have done ..}
<A>__{a side table features several pin sharp pencils. a sony pocket recorder. two packets of pall mall reds. two yellow legal pads. the chair moves into reverse and he breaks a puke colored file.}
<D>__{st anne alright, let's not beat about the bush, what ever that may mean, and get down on it. you were specific ally instructed by your chief, not to go anywhere near the blind inst itute? so why did you go up there?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{because of a feeling. i had a bad feeling this man was gonna turn up. st anne which man is that?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{the man i detail in my report, sir.}
<A>__{the report that's in his hands. (st anne knows well which man.)}
<D>__{is this an interview, or an interrogation? st anne it's an enquiry ...}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i'm not prepared to be interrog ated. i will be interviewed as an officer, who may be expected to cooperate with the investigator. st anne well, that's fine by me, john. and i'm sure that's fine by your chief.}
<A>__{he smiles the non smile. tosses his pencil down. and sits back.}
<D>__{so you thought your man might show?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{yes. st anne bit of a long shot, wasn't it?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{it was the only shot i had .. st anne so the one night you decide to go up there, he goes up there?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{that's right. except i'd decid ed to go up there every night .. st anne despite the wishes of your chief?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{yes. st anne you were prepared to fal sify your reports to him?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i had very good reasons for do.... st anne just a second, john. i knew there was something missing.}
<A>__{st anne cuts him off to pick up the phone. obviously something vital is needed. "could you bring an an ashtray in here? got a coupla guys who smoke in here." and attention back to the file.}
<D>__{you don't mind if i jump around a little this morning, do you? just while i'm easing my way into this?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{you're asking the questions, sir .. st anne you had an argument with ross? ass aulted one of the officers, right?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i wouldn't use the word "assault." st anne you got a "racy temper," sergeant?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{not especially. st anne just something they did, on this occasion, made you lose your rag?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{not they. he. taylor put a piece in the newspaper, which in my op inion put my witness in jeopardy. st anne from whom?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{from the man i detail in my rep ort. a crazy man, who to my cert ain knowledge has killed at least eight girls. six in san diego, one someplace else, and one up here .. st anne not a lotta support for that "scenario" though, is there?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{not a lot. st anne not even from ross?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{no. st anne is that why you lost your temper with him? frustration? no one believing you?}
<A>__{his assistant brings the ashtray. and st anne smiles gratitude.}
<D>__{so what can you tell me about you man?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{what do you mean, sir? st anne i mean, who is he?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i don't know who he is. who's "jack the ripper?" he's jack the ripper with an automobile. st anne you didn't run a profile?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{no, sir .. i didn't have the res ources, and it isn't my expertise. st anne this crazy man? what makes you think he wants to eliminate miss robertson?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{you read my report, sir. st anne i'm asking a question ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{because he reads i'm investigating the disappearance of her friend, & miss robertson becomes the focus of his anxiety. how good of a "witness" is she? he's crazy, but not stupid, he's intelligent. got a flexible m. o., and he doesn't wanna get caught. st anne just like "jack the ripper?"}
<A>__{this is meant to humiliate and meant to annoy and it does both.}
<D>__{alright, we'll have plenty of time to discuss your "mystery man," and his "flexibility" later, right now, i'd like to talk about the "event."}
