<T>__{smash cut to:}
<L>__{exterior interior sam's truck night}
<A>__{the truck speeds on highway 376 toward the fort pitt tunnel. patrick drives. sam cranks the radio, blaring "the tunnel song." the star's anthem, "your ex lover is dead" is our prototype for tone.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{my god. what is this song!?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{right? i have no idea.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{have you heard it before?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{never.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(light bulb)}
<D>__{wait! let's go through the tunnel!}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{sam, it's freezing.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{patrick, it's the perfect song!}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{no. mama patrick says no.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{patrick, it's sam. it's sam talking to you, i'm begging you to drive me }
<C>__{patrick}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{alright! i concede!}
<A>__{sam climbs through the window to the flat bed. she grips the flood lights to steady herself as she stands.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what is she doing?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{don't worry. she does it all the time.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{turn it up!}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{you got it, your highness.}
<A>__{patrick turns up the volume and drums on the steering wheel, just as the truck flies into...}
<B>__{the tunnel}
<A>__{we go behind the truck. rising as sam puts her arms in the air. the image moves to charlie's point of view, rising from sam's feet up her shivering legs. past the band aid on her right knee. to sam's face as she looks down. into the camera. right at us. for we are now... charlie, looking up at sam, so in love with this free spirit. so happy to have friends. happy to be alive. charlie gets this look on his face. patrick notices and smiles.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i feel infinite.}
<A>__{the truck flies out of the fort pitt tunnel onto the bridge. patrick and charlie laugh as sam raises her arms. free and young and alive on the greatest night of charlie's life.}
