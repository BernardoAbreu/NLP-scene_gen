<A>__{hit. fucked up bowman, 17, super preppy with a wan, baby huey face, takes a slug of vodka. they are jittery, sweaty, tweaked, fucked up }
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{all i'm saying, what i'm saying, is it never seems like anybody ever says anything that matters to them, like we all look at each other and nod with responses we've been trained to make, not real responses, just social conventions, phony, fake smiles, surface bullshit... i mean, we're all smart and do we have any idea what each other are like, really like? do i know what seth's afraid of, or vanessa, or fucked up bowman?}
<A>__{everyone looks at fucked up bowman who grinds his jaw appreciatively }
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{...probably, but do i ever say this stuff, just say, "hey, i'm uncomfortable in this crowd, i don't know what the fuck i'm doing, either? i know you're afraid and it's okay "}
<A>__{seth's words come quickly, they're riffing, totally in sync, totally wired }
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{we act like we have all the answers and we're totally invincible like our parents seem and their parents before them and it's fucking bullshit }
<A>__{fucked up bowman takes another slug of vodka and almost pukes.}
<D>__{fucked up bowman for instance }
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{for instance i know you jack off thinking about caroline even though you're supposedly "in love" with vanessa. whatever the fuck that means?}
<P>__{(a digression)}
<D>__{i mean, what is that convention, anyway? we're all these random collections of self interest, and then we just decide that now we're two people walking along }
<A>__{caroline expels a hit of rock cocaine }
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{and vanessa doesn't think she's pretty so she does all these weird fucking diets which is totally about self esteem. and she's beautiful.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and that's not even fair. because listen to me. i'm fucking lying right now. this is exactly what i'm talking about... i'm supposedly talking about you, making some big point about you, and it's really about me. so i should talk about me, not you, not even the universal "you..."}
<P>__{(takes a beat)}
<D>__{okay. okay, i'm worried i'm not really smart or that i'm not nearly as smart as people think i am, or that my parents' expectations have been way too high since i was five, i mean who knows they're going to harvard when they're five, not that i'm blaming them for anything because everything's great, and i may not even get in, but we all feel this shit and we never acknowledge it and if we can't acknowledge it to the people we care the most about then who will we ever say it too and what kind of life will that be?}
<A>__{they all look at each other with love. this is an adventure and they're having a connection }

<D>__{let's be different fucked up bowman i can't feel my hands.}
<A>__{bowman looks around, squinting, confused. he's chalk white.}
<D>__{fucked up bowman i'm serious }
<A>__{suddenly, he clutches his chest and begins to twitch. puke and foam come from his mouth. he seizes and falls from the chair. vanessa screams. seth and caroline push the table aside to get a better look. other people in the kitchen slowly take notice.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{he's blue. he isn't breathing }
<C>__{caroline}
