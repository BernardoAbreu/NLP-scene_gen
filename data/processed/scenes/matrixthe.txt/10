<A>__{trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at the end of the block, in a pool of white street light, she sees it. the telephone booth. obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk, focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the phone begins to ring. across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u turns, its tires screaming as it accelerates. trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the telephone booth as if taking aim. gritting through the pain, she races the truck slamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly bright, bearing down on the box of plexiglas just as she answers the phone. there is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk barreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick wall, smashing it to plexiglas pulp. after a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of the garbage truck. agent smith inspects the wreckage. there is no body. trinity is gone. his jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration. agent jones walks up behind him.}

<A>__{we are sucked towards the mouthpiece of the phone, closer and closer, until the smooth gray plastic spreads out like a horizon and the small holes widen until we fall through one swallowed by the darkness that becomes a computer screen. we are on line, inside a chat room called "the matrix." it is an exklusive web site where hackers hang out.}
