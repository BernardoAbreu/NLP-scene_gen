<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{drew tries to look out the window. then we hear a low, guttural growl. drew slowly turns... zowie is standing down the hall, leveling a dead stare. zowie takes the first step forward.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{no, zowie! it's me!}
<A>__{pleading, drew slowly retreats down the hallway. along the way, he backs right into... gus, grinning from ear to ear. drew recoils against the wall, swinging up his shotgun.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{stay back!}
<A>__{but gus just keeps on grinning. he takes a step forward... drew pulls the trigger... and click! nothing happens. the chambers are empty.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{forget something, drew buddy?}
<A>__{gus raises his hand. he's holding the shotgun shells. he lets them fall to the floor. suddenly gus wrenches the gun from drew's hands. he swings it and... ...drew screams and ducks beneath the blow, as the shotgun butt smashes a hole in the wall above his head. gus flings the shotgun aside and lunges for drew... drew races down the hallway to the back door. he turns the latch. the deadbolt has been locked from the inside. drew's eyes whip to the keyholder on the wall. all the keyhooks are empty. here comes the jingling of keys in gus' pockets as he comes down the hall... drew dashes away from the back door. gus' eyes shift from drew's fleeing form to a box of tools in the service closet.}
<B>__{at the front door}
<A>__{drew jimmies the knob. again, the deadbolt is locked from the inside. tears are streaming down drew's face now. footsteps approach. drew spins around... gus is advancing, with a hammer tight in his grip.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(crazed)}
<D>__{you have the right to remain silent...}
<A>__{wham! gus smashes the hammer into the wall to punctuate his words. plaster goes flying.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...while i bash your fucking head in!}
<A>__{drew's eyes dart frantically, looking for a way out. the closest route of escape is up the stairs. down the hallway, zowie starts running forward. drew's caught between a rock and a hard place...}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you have the right to a lawyer, but you won't need one...}
<A>__{he runs for it. gus charges to intercept him... drew gets to the stairs first.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{...cause you'll be dead!}
<A>__{wham! gus brings the hammer down with the claw end leading. it sinks into the stair below drew's feet... zowie leaps past gus, tearing up the stairs as gus wrenches the hammer free...}
<B>__{upstairs}
<A>__{drew makes it to the top of the stairs with zowie right on his heels. drew dives into amanda and gus' bedroom as... zowie springs from the floor. drew slams the door shut, smacking zowie. zowie collapses to the floor, dazed.}
