<A>__{the millennium falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon sized asteroids. there is a continued display of explosions against the starry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock. the two remaining tie fighters follow the falcon to the large asteroid. the falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while, small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship. the tie fighters approach the falcon, but a giant asteroid hurtles directly into their path. as the asteroid continues on its way, it leaves remains of the two exploded tie fighters to tumble into deep space.}
