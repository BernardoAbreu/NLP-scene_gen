<L>__{interior double trailers day}
<A>__{it's quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command post living quarters. the books are lined up neatly on the shelves. the computers sit, booted up and awaiting data input. all the way in the back, past the spare tires and life preservers and canned food and bottled water, up in one storage bin all the way on top, there's a rustling sound. a plastic student id card pops out in the cracks under the bin's door. a photograph in the lower right hand corner of the card is visible it's kelly, malcolm's twelve year old daughter. the card wriggles against the lock and, with a soft click, the door pops open. kelly herself tumbles out, wrapped in several blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish liquid. we can guess. she leaps to her feet, blinks the light out of her eyes, and bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can. she races through a narrow door and slams it shut. a sign on the door says "restroom." inside, a sigh of relief is heard.}
