<A>__{skip sits in the front of the bus, doing a crossword puzzle. larry reads a book "how to make a million dollars in real estate with no money down". deke turns up his tape deck george jones sings "he stopped loving her today". mickey turns up his tape deck across the aisle aretha franklin sings "r e s p e c t". deke turns his volume louder mickey does likewise, and soon we have dueling tape decks. c & w going head to head with r & b. a cacophony. skip leaps to his feet, whirls and shouts.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i got one word to say to you shut up!}
<A>__{silence. and then from the back of the bus, some soft, gentle, but slightly dissonant guitar chords. the back of the bus nuke sits across the aisle from crash, who's re reading thomas pynchon. nuke has a guitar and is struggling with some chords to "try a little tenderness". he butchers the chords and the words.}

<D>__{oh she may be weary, young girls do get weary, wearing the same old dress...}
<A>__{he shoves the guitar back at nuke.}
<C>__{nuke}
