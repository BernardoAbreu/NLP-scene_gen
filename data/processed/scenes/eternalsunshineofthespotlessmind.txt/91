<A>__{mierzwiak works the equipment. he has located a small area of light in the brain imaging and eradicates them.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{i'm getting the hang of it. i still understand it. but i'm finding him quickly enough. i'm hopeful there won't be too much peripheral eradication.}
<A>__{mary sits on the bed.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(a little giggly)}
<D>__{i like watching you work.}
<A>__{stan sighs, grabs his coat.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i will go out for a smoke. if no one minds.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{that's fine, stan.}
<A>__{mary doesn't say anything. stan huffs and is out the door. mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light. mary gets up her courage to speak.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{do you like quotes, howard?}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{how do you mean?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{oh, um, like famous quotes. i find reading them inspirational to me. and in my reading i've come across some i thought you might like, too.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{oh. well, i'd love to hear some.}
<A>__{mary is thrilled, beside herself. she tries to calm down.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{okay, um, there's one that goes "blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{is that nietzsche?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yeah, yeah it is, howard. and here i was thinking i could tell you something you didn't know.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{it's a good quote, mary. i'm glad we both know it.}
<A>__{he smiles at her. she's flustered, flattered.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(sputtering)}
<D>__{there's another one i like, i read. it's by pope alexander.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{alexander pope?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yes, shit. oops, sorry!}
<P>__{(puts hand over mouth)}
<D>__{sorry. it's just i told myself i wasn't going to say pope alexander and sound like a dope and then i go ahead and do it. like i psyched myself out.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{it's no big deal.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you are such a sweetheart.}
<A>__{there's an embarrassed moment as that line hangs in the air. then mary plunges ahead to bury it.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{anyway, the quote goes "how happy is the blameless vestal's lot! the world forgetting, by the world forgot: eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! each prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd".}
<A>__{she smiles, proud and embarrassed.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{that's lovely.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{really? i thought it was appropriate maybe. that's all.}
<P>__{(beat, then quickly)}
<D>__{i really admire the work that you do. i know it's not proper to be so familiar but i guess since we're outside the workplace i feel a certain liberty to }
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{it's fine, mary. i'm happy to hear it.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{okay. good. great. thanks.}
<P>__{(blurting)}
<D>__{i like you, howard... an awful lot. is that terrible?}
<A>__{mierzwiak seems momentarily taken aback, then returns to his unflappable self.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{you're a wonderful girl, mary.}
<A>__{she leans over and kisses him, then pulls away quickly.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i've loved you for a very long time. i'm sorry! i shouldn't have said that.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{i've got a wife, mary. kids. you know that.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(suddenly weepy)}
<D>__{i wish i was your wife. i wish i had your kids.}
<A>__{mierzwiak comforts her with a hug. it turns into kiss. he pulls away.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{we can't do this.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no you're right. once again. you're a decent man, howard.}
<A>__{he smiles sadly at her. she smiles courageously at him.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{i want you to know it's not because i'm not interested. if that means anything.}
<A>__{they look at each other a long while, then howard goes back to locating and eradicating blips of lights.}
