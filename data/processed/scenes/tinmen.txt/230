<L>__{interior coffee shop day}
<A>__{tilley, sam, bb and bagel are sitting at a table together looking at menus.}
<C>__{bb}
<P>__{(looks up from his menu)}
<D>__{i tell you what... i will drop the charges against you, and we can wipe the slate clean.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{i appreciate it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{see how quickly you can clear it up?}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{but i don't understand how the slate gets wiped clean when he breaks into my house and i'm the one charged.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{i told you, i wasn't breaking into your house. i was looking for your wife.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{all right... all right... i'm too tired... the slate's clean... the slate's clean.}
<A>__{the waitress approaches.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{what will you have?}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{couple of eggs over, some hash browns, some toast toasted dark... butter on the side, large grapefruit juice and some coffee.}
<A>__{the waitress writes his order.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{on second thought, instead of the eggs over, if i ordered soft boiled eggs do you take them out of the shell or leave them in the shells?}
<A>__{we can see that bb is getting a little irritable.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{we leave them in the shell.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{i don't like them that way because they get hot in the hand and it's hard to scoop the stuff out... it's not good... and you get little bits of shell in there and it doesn't taste good.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{why don't you just order some scrambled eggs and be done with it... all right?}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{if i'm going to order, at least i ought to be content with my food.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{i'm getting a little hungry... i've got a headache as it is. just order some eggs so some other people can have something to eat before the lunch trade comes in.}
<C>__{tilley}
<P>__{(looks to sam)}
<D>__{why do i need a guy telling me what i should or shouldn't eat?}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{this is not a four star restaurant ... we're not having a gourmet meal... we're ordering breakfast, for christ sake!}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{it so happens i haven't been to this restaurant before. i don't know how they do their eggs... if they're over easy and they're gooey, i'm not happy with it... and i'm not happy if the soft boiled eggs are left in the shell...}
<C>__{bb}
<P>__{(to waitress, cutting tilley off)}
<D>__{can i have some french toast and a cup of coffee?}
<P>__{(to bagel)}
<D>__{bagel, what do you want?}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{hey! i'm ordering here. at least you can have the courtesy to let a man order his breakfast.}
<C>__{bb}
<P>__{(to waitress; ignoring tilley)}
<D>__{french toast and a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{tilley}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{sam, this guy gets on my nerves... from day one! i knew it then and i know it now.}
<A>__{tilley stands up from the table and starts to leave.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{i'm back to pressing charges against you!}
<A>__{tilley turns and is face to face with bb.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{you want to play that way? this game ain't over, mister... it ain't over...}
<A>__{bb stands up. the waitress steps back and looks concerned.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{all right, you want to finish it now? you want to finish it right now? i'm ready... i'm ready now!}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{you're ready?! you're ready, that's what you're saying?! you're ready now?! i have to be intimidated... i have to be brought here to be intimidated...}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{i can't stand it any longer. you're driving me out of my mind.}
<A>__{bb lunges for tilley across the table, sam and bagel try to intervene the waitress doesn't know what to do.}
<C>__{bagel}
<D>__{come on, guys... take it easy... take it easy.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{get the people with the straitjackets... this man is out of control.}
<A>__{tilley and bb pull at one another.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{we're gonna finish it... we're gonna finish it.}
<A>__{bagel and sam pull them apart.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to tilley)}
<D>__{come on, let's get out of here.}
<A>__{sam ushers tilley to the door.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{i'm not finished with him, sam.}
<P>__{(to bb)}
<D>__{you heard me... i'm not finished with you, mister.}
<A>__{he storms out of the coffee shop with sam. bagel sits back, looking relieved. bb composes himself. the waitress nervously stands by.}
<C>__{bb}
<P>__{(to waitress)}
<D>__{so, i'm having french toast and coffee.}
<P>__{(to bagel)}
<D>__{bagel?}
