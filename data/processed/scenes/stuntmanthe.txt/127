<L>__{114 angle on cameron}
<A>__{seated on the wing, his back against he fuselage, legs firmly against the struts. his white silk scarf streams into the tearing wind. jamming a champagne bottle into the german's boot, he holds it up. the pilot grins approval, popping the cork on a second bottle which spouts foam into the slipstream. laughing, he passes a glass to cameron and pours from above. the liquid is lost in the wind. shrugging, he swigs from the bottle and hands it to cameron. cameron drinks. the champagne pours down his throat and face and, holding the strut with one hand, he rises to his feet. the pilot waggles his wings, giving cameron a seesaw ride to get his bottle back. cameron now seems drunk. he lets go of the strut and stands leaning against the wind. as the pilot toasts his courage, cameron's balance falters and he grabs the strut. now, cameron picks his way through the guywires toward the end of the wing. then he bounces up and down, rocking the plane. the pilot starts to sing to cameron's rhythm, "how ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm..." and cameron dances the charleston.}
