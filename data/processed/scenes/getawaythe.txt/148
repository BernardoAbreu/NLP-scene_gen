<C>__{doc}
<D>__{now.}
<A>__{carol stands on the accelerator. the mercury goes screaming forward, as doc shoots out the back window. then, as the terrified cops duck to the side, he shoots out their front windshield. the mercury bounces up across the sidewalk as the empty plates and glasses topple off the serving tray and roll across the concrete. the car slams back down through a vacant space on the opposite side, and moves around in a semicircle across the asphalt, heading for the highway exit. doc smashes out the rear window with the butt of his shotgun. the black and white now in reverse, zooming back, trying to get between the mercury and the highway. carol bringing the car around, she can see the squad car streaking backward. she pulls the wheel to the right and brings her car across the front of the still stopping police car. the officers try to bring their guns into play as the mercury streaks in front of them.}
<B>__{doc fires the shotgun twice}
<A>__{the police car explodes. the hood is lifted off the car. both officers jump out of the vehicle, pouring shots after the retreating mercury. carol screaming as the front and back windshields shatter around her. the mercury, badly riddled, pulls out onto the highway another squad car comes speeding up in the opposite direction. the driver hits the brakes, the tires smoke along the street as the black and white screams to a stop.}
<B>__{carol pulls the mercury by the squad car doc fires another two bursts...}
<A>__{the police car the front and back fenders are hit; the wheels disintegrate the impact of the shells rocks the black and white upward. the second passenger cop, firing a .38 out his back window at the mercury as it streaks down the road. three holes open up on the trunk of the auto. doc can see both officers jump out of the second black and white through the rear window. carol makes a quick turn off the highway. the mercury roars down the dark street into the city's commercial section, suddenly slow, makes another sharp turn this time through a red light. down a smaller street filled with shops carol rounds the corner, whips up to the curb doc and carol jump out of the car. she carries the suitcase, he hangs onto his big gun. doc and carol, moving down a deserted sidewalk; the sound of sirens. they round a corner, then quickly move into an alley. the alley is narrow, deserted. doc and carol pull back into an alcove as a prowl car goes screaming down the street and off into the night. they continue down the alley. the opposite entrance to the alley is blocked by a large metal garbage container, and the driver empties two cans of garbage into it. then he starts across the narrow street beyond in order to grab several others. doc looks behind him, then grabs carol's arm. they run for the container. doc tosses the suitcase into the container, jumps in, reaches back, pulls carol in beside him. sirens again sound close by. after a moment, a large garbage truck pulls up, lifts the container with hooks and dumps the garbage and doc and carol into the truck.}
<B>__{a series op angles as a crusher begins to move towards them}
<A>__{inside the truck. doc and carol start to panic, but they have room enough. within the truck doc wiggles his .45 out of his jacket and into his hand. he, carol and the suitcase are crushed tightly amongst the garbage. a moment after doc frees his gun, a load of garbage descends on their shelter, partially obscuring them.}
<B>__{the truck pulls out}
<A>__{doc and carol sweating... breathing hard. again the sound of sirens... the truck lurches forward. the truck moves along the empty streets, passing several prowling squad cars.}
