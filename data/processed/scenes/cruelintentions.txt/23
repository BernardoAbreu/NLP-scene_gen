<L>__{exterior central park day}
<A>__{kathryn and cecile sit on a blanket. a lavish picnic lies around them. kathryn wears large sunglasses, a scarf and a hat to protect her from the sunlight. she sits behind cecile and braids her hair.}

<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{ah duh. boys. i've never even gone to first base with a guy. what do i do?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{eww. no. that's gross.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{it's not gross. how else do you think girls learn? here turn around and face me.}
<A>__{cecile turns and faces kathryn, who removes her glasses.}
<C>__{kathryn }
<D>__{now close your eyes and wet your lips.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{are you for real?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{do you want to learn or not?}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{i guess. it still sounds gross.}
<A>__{cecile does as instructed. kathryn leans in and kisses her on the mouth.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{see that wasn't so bad.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{it was nothing.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{let's try it again, only this time i'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. when i do that i want you to massage my tongue with yours. that's what first base is.}
<C>__{cecile}
<P>__{(reluctant)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{eyes closed.}
<A>__{cecile closes her eyes. kathryn leans in and kisses her again, only this time longer. she continues to kiss her then gently pushes her tongue into cecile's. cecile does as instructed and they start to make out. kathryn eyes look towards the ground where cecile's hands are now clutching the grass. kathryn smiles and continues her seduction. she places her hand on cecile's thigh and moves it under her dress. cecile lets out a soft sigh. kathryn breaks from the kiss. they look at each other and smile.}
<C>__{kathryn }
<D>__{not bad.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{that was cool.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{maybe you should try it on your friend ronald sometime.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{oh come on cecile. he's crazy about you.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{is it that obvious?}
<A>__{kathryn nods.}
<C>__{cecile }
<D>__{he sends me letters you know. love letters.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{that's so romantic. have you responded?}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{well do you like him?}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{cecile, we just made out in the middle of central park. you can trust me.}
<C>__{cecile}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i do like him. i can't stop thinking about him.}
<A>__{cecile starts to cry. kathryn hugs her.}
<C>__{cecile }
<D>__{what am i going to do? if my mother found out about ronald she would kill me.}
<A>__{kathryn grabs her and looks her straight in the eye.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{listen to me. your mother must never know. never.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{did you hide the letters?}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{yes. they're in this antique doll house in my room.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{i want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{cecile if there's one thing i'm great at it's love letters. with my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{you'd do that for me?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{of course i would. we're friends, right?}
<C>__{cecile}
