<C>__{jud }
<D>__{i loved my dog a lot, louis. when spot died, i thought i was gonna die.}
<A>__{jud is sitting on the front stoop. it's the same house jud lives in now, but the porch hasn't been added yet, and the road is dirt rather than tar. along this road comes a horse drawn wagon stanny b.'s wagon. the wagon's full of junk, rags, bottles...stuff to sell and swap. strung across the top are bells, and we can hear their chiming sound...but faint, like bells heard in a dream. stanny b. is old and drunk. dust spumes up behind the wagon as he draws up to the crandall house and stops. he gets down, almost falls, takes a bottle out of his back pocket, drinks, and approaches jud. we can see him speaking.}
