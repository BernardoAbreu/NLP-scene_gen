<B>__{sister act}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior st. anne's academy akron, ohio classroom}
<A>__{we are in a parochial school classroom, in the late sixties. the children all wear uniforms and sit at little desks. sister immaculata stands at the front of the room; she is a middle aged nun, very severe. the children are all terrified of her.}
<C>__{sister immaculata}
<D>__{who can name all the apostles? yes?}
<B>__{angle on christine carter}
<A>__{a thirteen year old girl sitting at a desk. she raises her hand.}
<C>__{sister immaculata}
<D>__{christine?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{sister, may i be excused?}
<C>__{sister immaculata}
<D>__{christine...}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{it's an emergency. real bad.}
<A>__{sister immaculata nods, pursing her lips. christine stands and heads for the door.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior girls room}
<A>__{christine is now in the deserted st. anne's girls room. she is standing on tiptoes, looking in the mirror. she has taken her hair out of its neat barrettes; she is combing it out. she applies lipstick. christine reaches into her schoolbag; she pulls out a stack of glittery bracelets and slips them on. she unbuttons the top few buttons of her stiff white blouse. she sprays herself with dime store cologne.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior hallway}
<A>__{christine opens the girls' room door; she looks both ways. no one is around; she saunters down the hall.}
<B>__{angle on a door marked broom closet}
<A>__{christine opens this door. she looks into the closet. there is a very nervous thirteen year old boy waiting for her inside.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{hi, jimmy.}
<A>__{christine slips inside the closet and closes the door behind her.}
<B>__{angle on sister immaculata}
<A>__{striding down the hall, with a bloodthirsty look in her eye, and a nasty looking wooden ruler in her hand. she flings open the broom closet door,}
<B>__{angle on christine and jimmy}
<A>__{in the broom closet. jimmy's face is covered with lipstick. christine's hair is awry. the couple has clearly been making out.}
<C>__{sister immaculata}
<P>__{(outraged)}
<D>__{miss christine carter! again! don't you know what happens to girls like you? don't you know what they become?}
<L>__{interior christy's apartment angle on a large, tattered}
<A>__{poster night (today) taped over a crack on a wall. the poster shows a glittering christy van cartier: singing star of a fifth rate vegas lounge. christy wears tight spangles and a major wig on the poster. she has clearly lived up, or down, to all of sister immaculata's expectations. the camera pans through the dark bedroom in which the poster hangs; a neon sign flashes outside the window, casting a red and blue haze over the premises. a dressing room table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail polish and makeup, and garish clothing and flashy jewelry are scattered everywhere. we hear the movement of bed springs as someone sits up in the dark.}
<C>__{christy's voice}
<D>__{come on, vince hold me a minute.}
<C>__{vince's voice}
<D>__{i'd love to. babe but i've got to go. it was great. like usual.}
<C>__{christy's voice}
<D>__{it was twenty minutes. like usual.}
<C>__{vince's voice}
<D>__{the best.}
<A>__{vince larocca stands at the mirror, adjusting his clothing and checking his hair. vince is a powerful, charismatic man who rules an organized crime empire with personal magnetism and threat. vince's hold over christy is obvious, if unfortunate; he can seem expansive and generous one minute, ruthless and dangerous the nexterior}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(half to christy, half to the mirror)}
<D>__{you are something else.}
<A>__{christy turns on a lamp and lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{come on stay. just a little. we can talk, i will get a pizza. pizza in bed, we'll have fun. and you still haven't told me what happened. what did she say?}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{what did who say?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{who? the other woman. your wife.}
<A>__{vince turns to face christy, turning on the charm.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{you are so damn sexy.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{vince...}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{how did i get so lucky? what is it now, five years we've been together? who do i thank?}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(not buying it)}
<D>__{today was the deadline, vince.}
<A>__{vince sits on the bed. he takes christy's hand, and kisses it.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{i want us to be together. like people. honest, decent people. in the eyes of god. babe, today... i went to confession.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{you did what?}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{for the first time in i don't know how long. i wanted everything done right. open and above board. i told father antonelli i was in love. i told him it was a special love, for all the ages.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(starting to fall for it)}
<D>__{you said that? and what did he say? did he say you could leave her? did he say we'd be happy?}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(looking deep into her eyes)}
<D>__{he said that if i got a divorce i'd burn in hell. for all eternity.}
<A>__{vince kisses christy's hands again and drops turns away and starts putting on his shoes.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(outraged)}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{you want me to go against a priest? get excommunicated? you think i'm nuts?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{you bastard!}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(trying to calm her)}
<D>__{we can still see each other. just like always. it's a different kind of sin. smaller.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{you pig!}
<A>__{vince backs off, and starts searching for his jacket.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{babe, it's not me! i love you! it's god!}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{you lying sleazeball! the best years of my life! what am i, garbage? am i lint?}
<A>__{vince ducks as christy throws an ashtray at him, and it smashes against the wall.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{you're upset. i understand. i should go. i hate to.}
<A>__{a clock radio hits the wall beside vince's head.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{get out of here! and never come back!}
<A>__{a lamp hits the wall, as vince dodges it. he makes a phone gesture with his hand.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{i will call.}
<A>__{vince kisses two fingers, and blows the kiss to christy. he leaves. christy is left standing on the bed, holding a particularly garish stuffed animal she was about to hurl. with vince gone she slumps to the bed, cradling the stuffed animal. she is caught between tears and rage.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior las vegas night}
<A>__{angle on various neon vegas landmarks the golden nugget, caesar's palace, bally's, etc. scrunched in between two larger hotels and casinos is the moonlight hotel and casino. the moonlight isn't all that small, it's just seen better days.}
<L>__{interior lounge night}
<A>__{a spotlight hits a solitary figure on a small stage. the man is caped and dramatic, but not especially talented; an elvis impersonator who's just a shade off in voice, looks and style.}
<C>__{elvis}
<D>__{good evening, ladies and gentlemen. are you lonesome tonight? welcome to the moonlight hotel and casino's incredible platinum oldies spectacular.}
<A>__{backstage, there's still a look of resolve in christy's eye as she waits to go on with michelle and tina, her back up singers.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{but you can't quit. what'll happen to us?}
<P>__{(to tina)}
<D>__{tell her she can't quit.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{i told her. she stuck pantyhose in my mouth.}
<A>__{onstage, elvis glances into the wings to be sure the ronelles are ready.}
<C>__{elvis}
<D>__{please welcome our own girl group extraordinaire, our beehives of beauty the fabulous ronelles!}
<A>__{elvis disappears. the spotlight hits christy, who wears a high beehive wig and a sequinned, early supremes style gown. michelle and tina wear matching gowns and wigs. the band begins a doo wop vamp.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{oh, girls.}
<C>__{ronelles}
<D>__{yes, betty?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{this prom is a real drag.}
<C>__{ronelles}
<D>__{oh huh.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{oh my!}
<P>__{(gasping)}
<C>__{ronelles}
<D>__{what is it, betty?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{look at that. get a gander.}
<C>__{ronelles}
<D>__{oh my!}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{he's so dreamy. he's like... a greek god. he's the cutest guy here. he's boss. he's fab. he's...}
<C>__{ronelles}
<D>__{yes, betty?}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{he's so fine.}
<C>__{ronelles}
<D>__{d00 lang, doo lang, d00 lang.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{wish he was mine. that handsome boy over there, the one with the wavy hair.}
<A>__{as they sing, their moves and gestures are carefully choreographed in vintage girl group style. a lot of talent and hard work has clearly gone into the number. while christy does her best, her singing voice is not on a par with those of the other ronelles. the lounge itself is practically empty, except for a few drunken shriners and a couple of college kids. police lieutenant eddie mulcahy sits at a ringside table with his eyes locked on christy. an easygoing charmer, eddie gives her a wink, but she responds with an up yours look and a turn to the other half of the room as the song continues.}
<L>__{interior dressing room later}
<A>__{a small, cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a sputtering fan for ventilation. christy has her own dressing table and mirror, and the ronelles share a table a few feet away. clothing and costumes hang on nails or are draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{screw this dump. it's a roach motel with sequins. every guy i meet is either married, a cop, or a lush from des moines.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{but what about us?}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{you taught us the act. the songs, all the moves.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{and where did it get me? i'm stuck in this rathole! you're holding me back, just like vince! i should be headlining!}
<A>__{a pock faced weasel of a man named joey opens the door and leans into the room.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{what do you want? this is a private area! get lost!}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{you ain't got nothin' i ain't seen.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{then stop trying to memorize it. hit the road.}
<A>__{joey takes a step into the room and sets a box on the chair near christy.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{from vince.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{his ashes?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{with love.}
<A>__{joey leaves. michelle and tina hover around the box, very excited. they pick it up, trying to tempt christy.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{from vince! with love!}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{michelle and tina can't restrain themselves: they open the box. inside is a rather gaudy fur coat. michelle and tina are impressed.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{it's a fur!}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{it's new!}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{it's a bribe. five years of my goddamned life!}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{so you earned it!}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{vince owns the casino! cash in}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{i should throw this in his facet}
<A>__{there's a knock on the door, and tina opens it. lieutenant eddie mulcahy enters. christy is not pleased.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{oh, jesus. what is going on here?}
<P>__{(to heaven)}
<D>__{why me? whose dog did i kill?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{hi, lieutenant.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{hello, eddie.}
<A>__{eddie picks up the coat.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{from vince? what a guy. doo lang, doo lang.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{at least he's not a cop. at least he can afford a decent gift.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i used to buy.you,..stuff. on your birthday . when we were seeing each other.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{yeah, like what? quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out? lottery tickets? a travel iron?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{so i don't shop.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{'cause you're always out, arresting people. making trouble. i don't know why i went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing! i couldn't hold my head up, i used to tell people you were a security guard!}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{oh, yeah? well, how do you think i felt? you were singing in bowling alleys back then. i told people you were a hooker!}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{calm down, you two. it's always like this.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{yeah, well, now, she goes out with a' better class of people. vince laflocca.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{he's a businessman.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{a what? when are you qonna wake up?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{when are you gonna get off my case? have you got a search warrant? what do you want cheap thrills?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{information, baby. i thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{think again! and get out of here.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i'm going. my regards to vince, and the mrs.}
<A>__{christy hurls a jar of cold cream at eddie's head. he ducks, and the jar hits the door.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{ladies.}
<A>__{eddie leaves. christy is standing, absolutely furious.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{that's it! i'm not taking it from him, and i'm not taking it from vince! from now on, it's all about me! and if i can't spend it, drink it, or sleep with it it's gone. like sister immaculata used to say, "life is short, and then you fry." so long, girls see you in church!}
<A>__{christy grabs the mink and heads out the door.}
<L>__{interior vince's office night}
<A>__{ernie schmidt sits across the enormous mahogany desk from vince. the young man's throat is dry; he's sweating bullets. the presence of joey the weasel and willy, a brutal thug, increases ernie's tension.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{ernie schmidt. how long you been with us, ernie schmidt?}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{three years, mr. larocca. one behind the bar, two as croupier.}
<A>__{vince gestures to the lush office and its furnishings.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{ernie, you know what's important to me? what counts? it's not all this. this is ' what? frosting. loyalty. that's me, ernie. that's home.}
<A>__{vince gestures to joey, who takes out a revolver and points it at ernie's head.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{you ain't been loyal, ernie. what did you tell the cops?}
<A>__{ernie's eyes open wide with denial as the gun comes closer to his temple.}
<L>__{interior hotel lobby}
<A>__{holding the coat, christy waits by the elevator. it arrives; she gets in.}
<L>__{interior vince's office}
<A>__{the interrogation continues.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{i didn't tell the cops anything. i swear.}

<A>__{joey slams ernie on the side of the head with the gun.}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{christy steps out of the elevator and faces a maze of office cubicles with half wall partitions. the floor is deserted and dark as she makes her way through the cubicles.}

<D>__{why am i wasting my time?}
<L>__{interior executive corridor}
<A>__{beyond the cubicles, christy strides down a lush corridor to an executive suite. she tries the knob, but finds the door locked. pulling a key from her purse, she unlocks the door to the suite and enters a large outer office with a reception area and doors to several inner offices. she tosses the key onto the receptionist's desk.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{won't need that anymore. ta ta.}
<A>__{crossing to vince's office, christy squares her shoulders and narrows her eyes with anger as she reaches for the doorknob. she pauses for a second, and then doubles her resolve.}

<P>__{(to joey)}

<A>__{christy tries to speak; she can't.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{christy. is there a problem? with the coat?}
<A>__{christy glances around the room; she doesn't move. she quickly sizes up the situation. she tries to appear matter of fact. unaffected by what she's just seen.}

<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{christy}

<L>__{interior reception area}
<A>__{christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from vince's office. she passes through a glass door which leads to the cubicle area. long shot of the cubicle area, which resembles a darkened maze. christy hears joey approaching; she runs into the cubicle area.}

<D>__{christy? he only wants to talk to you!}

<D>__{come on, christy! there's no place to go!}
<A>__{christy steadies herself against a xerox machine. she accidentally activates the machine, which lights up and starts humming. angle on willy, as he hears the xerox machine. he quickly moves toward the sound. willy reaches the xerox machine; the area is deserted. he starts moving quickly down the aisle a chair, the kind on casters, comes rolling out of one of the cubicle doorways; the chair hits willy and he falls. christy runs out of the cubicle; willy is on the floor, struggling to get up. as christy sprints away, willy shoots at her. he misses, but a glass partition shatters. christy runs for an open elevator, but it has been summoned from another floor and the doors are beginning to close. she runs even faster. a bullet whistles past her ear and hits the back wall of the elevator. she reaches for the doors a moment too late, and the elevator is gone. christy scrambles to the door beside the elevator and runs into a stairwell as two more bullets bite pieces out of the door.}
<L>__{interior stairwell}
<A>__{taking the stairs three at a time, christy is flying, still clutching the mink. the thugs are gaining on her. a bullet hits metal and ricochets off several walls and steps. at the next landing, christy opens the door and ducks into a corridor.}

<C>__{christy}
<D>__{but everything that's happening is good! you can be a part of it!}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{a part of what? mary clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday. you have raised the sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them. they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.}
<C>__{mother superior }
<D>__{you and i know that life is not so simple. there will be disappointments. rude shocks. and you will have vanished. how... fortunate.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{okay, so i just got things started. but you could build on that. you could keep it going.}

<P>__{(delighted)}
<D>__{ice cream!}
<C>__{mary patrick}

<D>__{a thank you? for what? you're the one we should be thanking.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<D>__{is there any syrup?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{well... see, at my old convent, i wasn't always... real popular. i was sort of selfish and... not real helpful. okay, i will say it i wasn't much of a nun. but now, thanks to all of you... maybe i'm shaping up.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{mary clarence, don't be silly. you're an example to us all. you've taught us so much. we're singing for the cardinals, and then who knows? maybe the choir can travel to schools, and nursing homes.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<D>__{we could cut a demo. look for a label.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(knowing she has to leave)}
<D>__{that's true, wouldn't that be great. of course, we never know when things are going to change. any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.}

<D>__{okay, it's me. mary clarence. christy. it's chris carter. i need some help here. i can't believe i'm doing this. okay, look, i know i should just get back in the car, and get the hell out of here. save my skin. i mean, it's not wrong, vince really wants to kill me. why do you make guys like vince? but if i don't sing at st. matthew's... mary robert. mary patrick. it means so much to them. they're counting on me and i like that. maybe reverend mother is right, maybe i am a bad influence, maybe i'm just some vegas slut, but... can we cut a deal here? i mean, i still don't believe in, like, most of the commandments, and stuff in church still gives me the willies, but if i go back and sing, if i do a good deed, will you promise i won't get killed? all i want is a sign. lightning. thunder. anything.}
