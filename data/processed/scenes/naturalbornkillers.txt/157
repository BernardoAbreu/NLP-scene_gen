<L>__{interior jail corridor (outside the holding cell) day}
<A>__{there are even more deputy sheriffs in the corridor. cross fire whistles by as roger dodges to catch up with the caravan. the footage is very similar to vietnam footage. it's shaky, real, harsh, and it captures the pandemonium of battle. the soundtrack is a mixture of yelling, crying, laughing, and gunfire. hostage deputy #1 is shot, and discarded by mickey. the wild caravan runs down the hallway, firing behind them. mickey's hit, but keeps on running and firing. mallory sees this and screams.}

<A>__{roger's camera runs along with them.}
<C>__{roger }
<D>__{man, oh, man...this is better than vietnam!}
<A>__{more deputies appear at the end of the hallway. mickey and mallory get back to back with each other, using duncan as a shield in front of them and wayne behind them. mickey fires from the front, mallory fires from the rear.}

<D>__{please don't kill me! don't kill me...}
<A>__{camera whip pans to catch a deputy hopping around the corner. the screen flashes white with a blast. roger's hit, and the camera goes haywire, reeling out of control, the thunking to the ground. roger screams o.s. camera lies on the floor, video still transmitting. roger rolls into frame screaming.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{get the camera! get the fucking camera!}
<A>__{back to: color 35mm. as mickey fires cover for her, mallory swipes the camera from roger's side. the knox's start running again, still holding wayne and last hostage. deputies are lying on the ground, wounded and screaming, or dead and silent.}
