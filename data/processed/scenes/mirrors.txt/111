<L>__{interior day farmhouse basement}
<A>__{we are in the dark basement, under the farmhouse. the door to the first floor opens, letting the light in. ben appears next to the silhouette of an old man robert esseker, 80 years old, anna's elder brother. robert walks down the steps, signaling ben to follow him }
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{you know, up to this day, the visions of anna's fits still haunt me at night.}
<A>__{they walk through the basement towards an old wooden door.}
<C>__{robert }
<D>__{i helped my father fix up this part of the basement, especially for her }
<A>__{the old man turns the key in the padlock. slowly, the door swings open, revealing }
<C>__{robert }
<D>__{her fits were too violent. my mother couldn't take her screams anymore.}
<A>__{what's left of a very primitive child's room, surrounded by double wire fencing and iron bars. rather than a cell, it more resembles a human sized cage, capable of resisting the most}
<B>__{ferocious beast.}
<A>__{as he's talking, images flash on screen painful memories from that time come back to him anna being carried to the basement, her innocent eyes full of hate. it's even hard to recognize the face of a little girl. her howling screams. her nails digging into her own flesh. her unnatural strength and the violent thrashing of her arms and legs.}
<C>__{robert }
<D>__{we had every priest, doctor, healer, coming from all over the state, one after the other. but no one could help her.}
<A>__{ben comes closer to the iron bars of the cage. he can see anna's scratch marks next to the bed, giving his imagination a taste of her plight and suffering.}
<C>__{robert }
<D>__{finally, dr. kane from new york answered my parents' cry for help. he rejected the idea of demonic possession, said he didn't believe in it. he was convinced that anna suffered from a rare form of personality disorder. he wanted anna under his care, at st. john's. my parents were very poor, but he agreed to cover all the hospital costs... in less than five months, dr. kane had cured anna. it was unbelievable. she was her old self again. a real miracle of science.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{and after the hospital?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{you don't know? she died there with all of kane's other patients.}
<A>__{ben takes the old release form out of his pocket and shows it to robert.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{anna left the hospital two days before the massacre. kane changed the records to make her disappear.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{you're not a journalist, are you? what do you want?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i want to know. after st. john's, where did she go?}
<A>__{robert stares at ben, unsure of saying what he's about to reveal to this perfect stranger }
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{anna came back to live with us for a while...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{for a while?}
<A>__{robert lowers his eyes.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{and after? why did she leave?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{because... because strange things started to happen in the house...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{with anna?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{no, not with anna...}
<A>__{the old man obviously doesn't want to get into the details. the memories are too painful.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{with the mirrors?}
<A>__{robert stiffens, eyeing ben with a dark look how does he know?}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{mr. esseker, tell me where i can find your sister. it's very important. it's a matter of life and death.}
<A>__{robert hesitates }
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{before he died, kane sent us a letter asking us to keep anna away from mirrors and that whatever happens she should be in a place where the mirrors could never find her.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{where is she now?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{to protect us, she left the house and joined the monastic orders, where mirrors are forbidden... st. augustine's monastery, on the road to midwich.}
