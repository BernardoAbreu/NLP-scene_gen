<C>__{cardenas}

<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{well i realized that she wasn't interested in me. she was just trying to get information out of me.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what kind of information?}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{she said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.}
<A>__{whispers from the crowd fill the room.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{did you suggest any?}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{yes insulin and others.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what did she say?}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{she said that those weren't any good because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned. she wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{ and what did you suggest?}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{cocaine.}

<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{we had dinner at a restaurant.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on miss lawson in the parking lot?}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you didn't grab her and try to kiss her?}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{if necessary i can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.}
<A>__{paley thinks for a moment. he is nervous.}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{well as i remember it, we had an argument.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{and the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<P>__{(hesitantly)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{and after that didn't you continuously harass miss lawson?}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{dulaney walks back to his desk and removes a tape player from a cardboard box.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{your honor, this is a tape from miss lawson's answering machine. i would like to play it now.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{objection. your honor, we don't know where this tape is from. who made it or under what circumstances it was made.}
<A>__{dulaney takes out two pieces of paper and approaches the bench.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{these are reports from two independent audio labs. they each state that the voices were recorded over the phone and that no alterations have been made.}
<A>__{judge burnham studies the paper.}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{i will allow it.}
<A>__{dulaney walks back to his desk and presses the play button. we hear a beep, then...}
<C>__{dr. paley's voice}
<D>__{rebecca i know you're there, godammit. answer the phone, you bitch! you can't treat me like this!}
<A>__{we hear a phone slam down. another beep.}
<C>__{dr. paley's voice}
<D>__{you want to play games with me? who the fuck do you think you are? okay we'll play. you'll be sorry.}
<A>__{dulaney stops the machine. he takes a dramatic pause, letting the words on the tape sink in. cardenas is dismayed and tries to hide his frustration. dulaney approaches paley who is now very nervous.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(quoting)}
<D>__{you'll be sorry?}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{i was angry.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you're still angry, aren't you? isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at miss lawson?}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{no she asked me about cocaine.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i suggest it never happened.}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{you can suggest anything you want. it happened.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{no further questions.}
<A>__{dr. paley's temper explodes. he is a loose cannon.}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{i may have been infatuated with her but i wouldn't perjure myself.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{that's all dr. paley.}
