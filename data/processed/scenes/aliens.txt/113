<A>__{the tractor limps to a halt. a half kilometer from the atmosphere processing station. the apc is a smoking, acid scarred mess.}

<A>__{ripley, still running on the adrenalin dynamo, spins out of her seat into the aisle.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{newt? where's newt?}
<A>__{feeling a tug at her pants leg she looks down. newt is wedged into a tiny space between the driver's seat and a bulkhead. she is trembling, and looks terrified, but it's not the basket case catatonia of before.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{newt gives her a thumbs up, wan but stoic. ripley goes back to the others. hudson is holding his arm and staring in stunned dismay at nothing, playing it all back in his mind.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{jesus...jesus...i don't believe it.}
<A>__{burke tries to have a look at hudson's arm.}
<C>__{hudson}
<P>__{(jerking away)}
<D>__{i'm all right, leave it!}
<A>__{ripley joins hicks who is bent over gorman, checking for a pulse.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{he's alive. i think he's paralyzed.}
<C>__{vasquez}
<D>__{he's fucking dead!}
<A>__{she grabs gorman by the collar, hauling him up roughly, ready to pulp him with her other fist.}
<C>__{vasquez}
<P>__{(to gorman)}
<D>__{wake up pendejo! i'm gonna kill you, you useless fuck!}
<A>__{hicks pushes her back. right in her face.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{hold it. hold it. back off, right now.}
<A>__{vasquez releases gorman. his head smacks the deck. ripley opens gorman's tunic, revealing a bloodless purple puncture wound.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{looks like it stung him.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{hey...hey! look, crowe and dietrich aren't dead, man.}
<A>__{they turn to see hudson at the mtob monitors, pointing at the bio function screens.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{they must be like gorman. their signs are real low but they ain't dead!}
<A>__{hudson is pale, panicky, and his voice echoes around the tiny metallic space and comes back to all of them as the near hysteria they all feel, fluttering just at the edges of their minds.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you can't help them. right now they're being cocooned just like the others.}
<C>__{hudson}
<P>__{(sagging)}
<D>__{oh, god. jesus. this ain't happening.}
<A>__{ripley and vasquez lock eyes. ripley doesn't want it to be "i told you so" but vasquez reads it that way. she turns away with a snap.}
