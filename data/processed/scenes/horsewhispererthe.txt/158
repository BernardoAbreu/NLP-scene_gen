<A>__{grace eats as she talks. joe and the twins are fascinated. annie asks tom, frank and diane;}

<D>__{ha...}

<D>__{ain't brain surgery.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it's pretty impressive. where i come from, you'd be a gold mine.}

<A>__{annie is so pleased and is about to reply, but grace, noticing tom smiling at annie:}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's from a jar.}
<A>__{there's an odd silence as a deflated annie serves frank.}
<C>__{frank}

<C>__{diane}
<D>__{well, i tried jar sauce once wasn't this good. ya gotta know which brand to buy. i'd like to get the name of this one.}
