<L>__{5. interior the ballroom}
<A>__{the man in the tuxedo stops to watch willie scott singing sexily on the stage. then he looks around and sees the table of somber chinese men that short round spotted earlier. as the man in the tuxedo walks toward the table, he removes a cigarette from a silver case. he arrives at the table just as the chorus and orchestra reach a crescendo and on the stage, a glistening, muscular slave swings a huge ham mer toward an enormous brass gong the man in the tuxedo leans to receive a light from a cigarette girl and, as the gong booms, the match flares to reveal his face for the first time: it's indiana jones. elegant in a tuxedo dressed to kill. the titles end and over this a legend appears on the screen:}
<D>__{shanghai 1935}
<A>__{at the table, the four chinese man in suits stare coldly at indi ana.}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{dr. jones.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{lao she.}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{nee chin lie how ma?}
<A>__{lao's men laugh and assume that indy doesn't understand his joke.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{wah hung how, nee nah? wah hwey hung jing chee jah loo nee kao soo wah shu shu.}
<A>__{lao she looks angry and his men's smiles fade.}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{you never told me you spoke my language, dr. jones.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{i don't like to show off.}
<A>__{indiana takes a seat across the table from shanghai's notorious crime lord. lao is fifty, wealthy enough to now display some fat, but still muscular from his fight to the top of the garbage heap.}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{for this special occasion, i ordered champagne and caviar.}
<A>__{indiana looks at the pile of caviar on the plate in front of him and stubs his cigarette out in it. the cigarette sizzles and lao's smiles dies with it. there's applause as wille scott finishes her song. at the table, lao stares at indiana with a strange intensity.}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{so, it is true, dr. jones? you found nurhachi?}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{sure, i found him. then last night i had a little trouble. somebody tried to slit my throat.}
<A>__{indiana looks across the table at lao's son, chen, who resembles a bulldog and snarls like one now.}
<C>__{indiana }
<D>__{it was dark, but i think one of your sons tried to get nurhachi without paying for him.}
<A>__{indy stares pointedly at chen's recently bandaged hand. chen mutters and stands angrily lao barks a command in chinese and chen sits down again.}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{you have insulted my son.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{next time i will cut off more than his finger.}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{dr. jones i want nurhachi.}
<A>__{lao pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket and puts it on the table. indiana glances at it.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{as i recall the deal was consid erably more.}
<A>__{now a pretty hand slips onto lao's shoulder and he looks up to see willie scott. lao kisses her hand. willie is unaware of the explosive mood at the table and she smiles flirtaciously at indi ana.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(to lao)}
<D>__{aren't you going to introduce us?}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{this is willie scott.}
<P>__{(watching indy)}
<D>__{and this is indiana jones, the famous archaeologist.}
<A>__{willie sits down between lao and indy. she takes out a small mirror to check her make up.}
<C>__{lao }
<D>__{dr. jones found nurhachi for me and is about to deliver him now.}
<A>__{lao nods across the table and indy sees kao kan, lao's second son, open his coat and remove a silver plated pistol. indiana looks worried. willie doesn't notice as she fixes her make up and coyly teases indiana.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{well i thought archaeologists were always funny little men searching for their mummies }
<P>__{(yelping)}
<D>__{aaahhh!}
<A>__{she looks down terrified at the knife indy is poking against her ribs.}
<C>__{wille }
<D>__{i was only kidding, can't you take a joke ?}
<P>__{(to lao)}
<D>__{lao, he's got a knife!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{put the gun away, sonny.}
<A>__{kao kan glances at his father. lao finally nods to his son and he slips the pistol back into his pocket.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{now i suggest you pay me what you promised or your girlfriend here is going to be squealing a new tune.}
<A>__{the ritzy patrons at the tables nearby are unaware of the tawdry drama quietly unfolding at this table. willie eyes the blade and whimpers. she looks imploringly at lao and he slowly reaches into his pocket. he puts ten gold coins next to the cash on the table. indy leans forward to look at the gold coins so intently that he fails to notice kao kan spilling some powder into indy's cham pagne glass!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{try again lao the deal was more.}
<A>__{the knife pokes willie and she whimpers again. lao reaches into another pocket and brings out a folded piece of rice paper he opens it and a large diamond and ruby spill out onto the table.}
<C>__{indiana }
<D>__{bingo...you see, lao, with a but of persuasion, even you can be an honest fellow.}
<A>__{indy smiles and jabs the knife into the middle of the table. then he lifts his champagne glass in a toast to lao who watches expectantly as indiana moves the glass toward his lips suddenly willie stands angrily, jostling indy's arm so that he doesn't drink his champagne.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{look at this! he put a hole in my dress from paris!}
<A>__{lao sees indy put his champagne glass down and he snarls at wil lie }
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{sit down!}
<A>__{willie quickly obeys. lao forces a smile at indy and lifts his glass to seal the deal }
<C>__{lao }
<D>__{to your health, dr. jones.}
<A>__{lao sips hs champagne and watches hopefully as indy picks up his glass and this time indy does drink the champagne. then he reaches for the cash but chen grins and puts a silver snuff bottle next to the cash, gold and jewels he tips the little bottle over and some white powder spills out of it }
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{a bonus, dr. jones. that is poison. you just drank the rest of it.}
<A>__{indiana examines his champagne glass and sees a residue at the bottom of it. he swallows and feels sick, wondering it it's fear or the poison already taking effect.}
<C>__{lao }
<D>__{there is an antidote for this poison. you give me nurhachi i give you the antidote.}
<A>__{indiana is sweating. willie looks at him and sees indy's hand shaking.}
<C>__{lao }
<D>__{the poison works fast, dr. jones. where is nurhachi?}
<A>__{indiana finally reaches into his pocket. next to the cash, gold, jewels and poison, indiana sets down a beautiful small box. lao and his men stare hypnotically at the exquisite gold and enamel box.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{this nurhachi's a very small guy.}
<A>__{nobody pays any attention to her as lao reaches for the box.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{inside are the remains of nur hachi the first emperor of the manchu dynasty.}
<A>__{lao opens the box carefully and stares reverently at the grey powder inside.}
<C>__{indiana }
<D>__{now what about the antidote, lao.}
<C>__{lao}
<P>__{(holding the box)}
<D>__{at last i have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{so, what's the big deal? let me see it }
<A>__{qillie grabs lao's arm and some of the precious ashes spill out of the gold box. stunned by this desecration of his ancestor, lao grabs willie by the wrist and twists her arm }
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{you fool!}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{ow, you're hurting me, you miser able little hood!}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{let go of her, lao. and give me the antidote.}
<A>__{lao just laughs evilly until a waiter moves up behind lao and the crimelord suddenly stiffens. he lets go of willie's wrist and raises his hands off the table. chen stops collecting the money and jewels. kao kan tenses and indy smiles at wu han, the chinese waiter with the scar, who is standing behind lao. wu han has a towel over his hand under it, he has a pistol pressed against lao's spine.}
<C>__{indiana }
<P>__{(smiling at wu han)}
<D>__{i like the service here.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{hey, he's not a waiter...}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{no, wu han's an old friend i brought along.}
<P>__{(to lao)}
<D>__{so, the game's not over. put the antidote on the table, lao.}
<A>__{lao carefully reaches into his pocket and puts a small glass vial of liquid next to the cash, gold, jewels, poison and sacred box. indy looks relieved as he reaches for the vial of antidote then he hears a muffled report! and another! wu han groans and sways. indy starts to stand but chen immedi ately turns the smoking pistol with the silencer that he used to kill wu han indy sees it pointed at him now and he remains in his seat. kao kan stands and grabs wu han, easing the phoney waiter into the chair he just vacated. the muffled shooting hasn't attracted any attention. the nightclub activity continues an indy speaks emotionally to his dying friend.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{wu han listen to me i'm going to get you out of here.}
<A>__{in pain, wu han looks at indy and struggles to speak }
<C>__{wu han}
<D>__{not this time, my friend...}
<P>__{(smiling bravely)}
<D>__{i followed you on many adventures but into the great unknown mystery, i go first, indy...}
<A>__{wu han dies and slumps forward. indiana is shattered by the death of his old friend.}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{don't be sad, dr. jones you will soon join him.}
<A>__{indy's gaze shifts from his dead friend to lao's sneering face. then indy sees the murderous chen giggling perversely. indy's anger is compounded by the poison burning in his gut and his vis ion of chen's ugly face blurs into a double image indy stands up unsteadily. chen assumes he's about to keel over from the poison but indy suddenly turns and grabs a real wai ter at another table. the waiter holds a long skewer of roasted pigeons that he's just set afire indy grabs the skewer of pigeons flambee and hurls is across the table! chen fires and misses and screams as the skewer stabs into his chest and the burning pigeons flame in front of his hor rified face! this the other tables definitely notice. there are screams and all hell breaks loose. indiana shoves past willie and reaches for the vial on the table }
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{the antidote !}
<A>__{but he's grabbed from behind by kao kan. indy elbows the punk, reaches back and grabs his head and somersaults kao kan onto the table! as nubmer two son crashes into the table, the impact sends the emperor nurhachi's ashes billowing into lao's stricken face! indiana yells as he sees the vial of antidote rolling across the table and falling! indiana dives and catches the antidote just before it hits the floor then indy's hand is brutally stomped on by one of lao's henchmen and the vial rolls away. indiana angrily raises his head, smashing it up into the hench man's groin the man howls like a banshee and hobbles away. meanwhile, willie watches lao grabbing for cash from the table. willie lunges past the pigeon skewered chen to snatch the jewels, but unfortunately kao kan knocks them off the table as he leaps to attack indy. indiana scrambles on his hands and knees after the rolling vial. people keep kicking it he almost has it when willie runs into him, trips and lands on her back.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{look out, damn it, i need that antidote!}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{who cares? where's that diamond!}
<A>__{gunfire explodes and they both scramble in different directions. indy dives through the fleeing nightclub patrons and slides be hind a water spewing fountain. water kicks up as indy is shot at by lao and his henchmen. indy sees the vial of antidote kicked again and it spins across the marble floor feeling the poison, indy shakes his head groddily and splashes water on his face. meanwhile, willie is chasing her diamond, shoving through the panicked crowd. she spots the diamond! another elegantly dresses soman is bending to pick it up }
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(acidly polite)}
<D>__{excuse me, but i believe that's my diamond!}
<A>__{willie smiles and suddenly kicks the woman in the butt! willie reaches to get the diamond but not before the other woman tackles her. behind the fountain, indiana makes a break he runs and dives on top of a serving cart. the wheeled cart hurtles toward an un suspecting gunman, crashes into him from behind and sends him flying head first into a row of ice buckets. nearby, willie slugs the other lady in the jaw and grabs for the elusive diamond just as the ice buckets showers ice across the floor which camouflages the diamond!}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{aw nuts!}
<A>__{searching desperately for the jewel, willie sees the vial of antidote spinning across the floor as it slides by, she grabs it.}
<C>__{indiana }
<D>__{hey,doll! don't move!}
<A>__{she sees indy speeding by atop the serving cart. lao and his gunmen rush out to block the way. indy rolls off the cart and slides behind a potted palm as lao's men open fire again.}
<C>__{indiana }
<P>__{(shouting to willie)}
<D>__{hey, don't go away! i need that!}
<A>__{willie smiles meanly as she slips the vial down the front of her dress, thumbs her nose at indiana and walks away.}
<C>__{indiana }
<D>__{if i wasn't dying, i'd kill her...}
<A>__{hiding behind the palm tree, indiana looks around and spots a gi ant statue at the side of the stage. indy makes a break for it. as the gunmen open fire, indy springs onto a chair jumps onto a table and leaps onto the stage. he grabs the golden broad sword from the chinese warrior statue! as bullets smash into the statue, indiana hides behind it. then he jumps out and swings the large sword toward the enormous brass gong. the crimson cord holding the gong is slashed! indy slings the sword at his assailants and gives the three meter high gong a helpful shove the giant gong rolls and echoes as it crashes down the marble steps. indiana ducks behind it as it gains momentum and rolls across the dance floor. using the gong as an enormous shield, indy evades the gunfire ex ploding bullets ricochet off the rolling brass gong as indy runs behind it. ahead, willie hurries toward an exit she hears something and turns her eyes go wide as she sees the mammoth gong bearing down on her! willie yells as indiana grabs her arm and pulls her behind the gong with him lao watches amazed as he and his gunmen dodge tables trying to get better firing positions and more henchmen come into the club now and start firing machine guns! as bullets clang against the gong, indiana and willie run behind it. willie hollers as they head directly for a towering, floor to ceiling window! indiana grabs willie around the waist and, after the huge gong crashes through the stained glass window, they both fly after it!}
