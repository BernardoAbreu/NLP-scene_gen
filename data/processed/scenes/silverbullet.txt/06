<L>__{exterior the rail rider night}
<A>__{there's a sound of bushes shaking. something comes out something huge. it leaps limberly onto the rail rider. it is a werewolf with greenish yellow eyes. tatters of clothes still hang from it. what kind of monster, exactly? it is humanoid as well as wolfish... and when we learn who it is in its human form, we should be able to spot the resemblance at once...and kick ourselves for not knowing earlier. it crouches there, huge and bushy and fanged and deadly, on the whole rail rider.}
