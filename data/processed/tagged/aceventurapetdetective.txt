<D>__{hey, ventura! make any good collars lately?}
<B>__{another cop}
<A>__{or were they leashes? they all bust up. aguado spots a bug on the ground.}

<D>__{homicide, ventura!}
<A>__{the cops are falling all over themselves laughing.}

<D>__{how you gonna solve this one?!}
<A>__{ace walks up to them and looks at the squashed bug.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{good question, aguado… first i'd establish a motive. in this case the killer saw the size of the bug's dick, and became insanely jealous.}
<A>__{the other cops all react with a big "ooooooo". aguado has no comeback. ace comes face to face with him.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{then i'd lose thirty pounds porking his wife.}

<A>__{ace turns to go.}
<C>__{ace }
<D>__{of course, that might not do any good. you see, nobody's missing a porpoise. it's a dolphin that's been taken. the common harbor porpoise has an abrupt snout, pointed teeth, and a triangular thorasic fin, while the bottlenose dolphin, or tursiops truncatus, has an elongated beak, round, cone shaped teeth, and a distinctive serrated dorsal appendage. (beat) but i'm sure you already knew that. (beat) that's what turns me on about you. hey… maybe i will give you a call sometime, lieutenant. your number still 911? alrighty then!}

<C>__{ace}
<D>__{well, i wouldn't say that. lord knows, there is plenty of evidence here to support your theory, except of course that spot of blood on the balcony.}
<A>__{on the railing, sure enough, there is a tiny spot of blood. einhorn glares at a couple of nearby cops. they look down.}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{first, people buy lottery tickets everyday. it's a habit. it doesn't prove a thing. second, the dog wasn't suffering from canine trauma, he was suffering from bladder trauma. sergeant neilson found a piss stain as big as lake huron near the bed. and third, the blood on the railing. simple. he doesn't jump far enough and whacks his head. a fact confirmed by the paramedics who found cuts on his scalp, with traces of a white chalky substance. i.e. plaster from the balcony.}
