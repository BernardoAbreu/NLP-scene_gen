<D>__{the day after the party, chris left on his trip and ended up staying away most of the summer. it was nearly three months before he walked back into our house in annandale. he had a scruffy beard, his hair was long and tangled, and he was rail thin. as soon as i heard he was home, i ran into his room to talk to him. in california, he'd looked up some old family friends who still lived there. he'd found out that long after he had been born, our dad had continued a relationship with his first wife marcia in secret.}
