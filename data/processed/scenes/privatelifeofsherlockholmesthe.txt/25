<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{watson, grim and breathless, stands in the open doorway. over the back of the wing chair, he sees smoke curling up from holmes' pipe.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{there you are, you wretch! you rotter! you blackguard! of all the vile, unspeakable fabrications. what do you have to say for yourself?}
<A>__{no answer from holmes. we now see but watson does not that the chair is occupied by a section of holmes' smoking machine, with the pipe attached.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{don't just sit there speak up, man!}
<A>__{still no answer just a little pipe smoke drifting up from the wing chair. incensed, watson raises the opera glasses, tosses them toward the chair. there is a loud thud, the pipe falls to the floor, then there is silence. watson suddenly becomes concerned.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{holmes...? are you all right, holmes?}
<A>__{he approaches the chair apprehensively, shoves it aside and there on the floor is the smoking machine, still wheezing slightly. watson picks it up, and his eyes travel to holmes, standing in a shadowy corner, working the bellows with his foot.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{from the sound of your footsteps, i gathered that you were not in a particularly amiable mood.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(with renewed fury)}
<D>__{how could you do a dastardly thing like that to me? what the deuce were you thinking of?}
<A>__{he dashes the smoking machine to the floor.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{watson, you have my most abject apologies. but have you ever been cornered by a madwoman? it seemed like the only way to get out of it without hurting her feelings.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{what about my feelings? and my reputation? do you realize the gravity of what you have done? the possible repercussions?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{so there'll be a little gossip about you in st. petersburg...}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{these things spread like wildfire. i can just hear those malicious whispers behind my back. i will never be able to show my face in polite society... and if it ever got back to my old regiment you don't know the fifth northumberland fusiliers they'll strike me off the rolls they'll cut off my pension...}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{watson, you're running amok.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{dishonored, disgraced, ostracized. what am i to do?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{well, for one thing, i'd get rid of that flower.}
<A>__{he points to the flower behind watson's ear. watson grabs the flower, hurls it into the fireplace.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you may think this is funny, but we're both in the same boat. we must take desperate measures. we must stop this talk...}
<P>__{(a beat, then an idea)}
<D>__{maybe if we got married...}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{then they'd really talk...}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(starts pacing)}
<D>__{obviously, we cannot continue to live under the same roof. we must move apart.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{of course, we can still see each other clandestinely on remote benches in hyde park, and in the waiting rooms of suburban railway stations }
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(a change in attitude; defiant)}
<D>__{the whole thing is ridiculous. we have nothing to hide.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{that's what i've been trying to tell you.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{let somebody start a rumor just one ugly word and we'll sue them for slander.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{nobody would dare. after all, you have an enviable record with the fair sex.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{damn right. i can get women from three continents to testify for me. and you can get women to vouch for you, too can't you, holmes?}
<A>__{no answer from holmes. watson is becoming a little concerned.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{can you, holmes?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{good night, watson.}
<A>__{he starts toward his bedroom.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{holmes, let me ask you a question }
<P>__{(holmes stops)}
<D>__{i hope i'm not being presumptuous but there have been women in your life?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{the answer is yes.}
<P>__{(a relieved sigh from watson)}
<D>__{you're being presumptuous.}
<P>__{(watson's face falls)}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{he walks into his bedroom, shutting the door. watson takes a tentative step after him.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{holmes...}
