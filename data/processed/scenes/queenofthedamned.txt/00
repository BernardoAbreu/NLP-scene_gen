<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior lafayette cemetery (new orleans) night}
<A>__{an empty breeze blows across a deserted cemetery. we hear the sound of footsteps approaching, then nineteenth century boots enter frame. we follow them strolling past the headstones and mausoleums. the sound of a horse and carriage echoes in the distance.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{there comes a time for every vampire when the idea of eternity becomes momentarily unbearable...}
<A>__{as we reach an old stone tomb, the boots leap up and out of frame. pan up to reveal: a figure stands steadily atop the roof of the tomb, silhouetted against the moon like a large, black bird.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{the wounds suffered from love and failed friendships don't heal like a human's, but seem to only gape larger. the longing to be mortal returns, a longing for finiteness.}
<A>__{a beat as the indistinct figure gazes out at the night...}
