<L>__{interior bedroom same night}
<A>__{a quieter room, drugged out, the pr guy cheerily leading jim, stepping over sleeping bodies, over fur coats strewn across the floor... to a man with white hair like a circus clown, his back to us, talking with some black tied european aristocrats looking so cool.}
<C>__{warhol}
<D>__{well, it was such a big opening, we just had to go to philadelphia, y'know, you were supposed to, mmm...}
<C>__{pr guy}
<P>__{(butting in)}
<D>__{andy! andy!}
<A>__{andy turning at the interruption. he looks like a chic voodoo doll. holding an incongruous gold telephone in his arms like a teddy bear. slightly slow mo as warhol's black empty eyes confront jim a pit of nothingness in them, amnesia, death. in jim's slow motion reaction we read what he sees. andy going on with his story, to the group that includes tom baker.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{...but so many people showed up, the paintings were getting crushed, so they took them all down... um, it really looked great y'know... maybe uhhh...}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<C>__{pr man}
<P>__{(cutting in)}
<D>__{...the walls. the blank walls. andy was the art. should do a show. just walls. today it's really about people, not what they do. it's the astronaut that matters, not the voyage, the actor, not the movie how do i say, it's the trip, not arriving.}
<A>__{andy is looking at jim. jim at andy.}
<C>__{pr man}
<P>__{(babbling on)}
<D>__{...you know what andy says, some day everybody's gonna be famous for 15 seconds, but it won't mean anything.}
<C>__{baker}
<D>__{that's too short. i need a coupla hours.}
<A>__{they laugh. andy's eyes hidden, face as white as styrofoam.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{we'd just love to have you in our movies jim, you're so beautiful, you'd be so good, you mmmm, here... this is for you jim.}
<A>__{andy shows his eyes, gives jim the gold telephone he's carrying.}

<D>__{edie gave this to me and said mmmmm, i could talk to god with this. but i don't really have anything to say. so... mmmm now you can talk to god. oh hi!}
<A>__{vanishes, waving to somebody else. jim holding the phone.}
<B>__{doors song}
<A>__{strange days have found us and through their strange hours we linger alone nico reappears waving at him to come quickly.}

<D>__{morrison!}
