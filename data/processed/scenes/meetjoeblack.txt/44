<L>__{interior parrish's office afternoon}
<A>__{jennifer shows joe in, parrish is deep in thought, beside him a meal laid out beautifully on his desk with linen and silver, but untouched. joe is more abstracted than usual, he is starting at parrish's food.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{are you going to eat your lunch}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{it's all yours.}
<A>__{joe starts eating, parrish watches him, somewhat fascinated, joe's chewing has improved.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{good?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{excellent. what is it?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{cold lamb sandwich with cilantro. a little coleman's mustard.}
<A>__{joe takes another big bite.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{truly uh splendid.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{glad you like it. my wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches. joan that was my wife }
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(familiarly)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{cold lamb sandwiches not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken. she knew stuff like that.}
<A>__{silence, parrish getting lost in his memories.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{ everything reminds me of her there isn't a day that goes by that i don't think about her one day she was here. the next day she was gone. what are you going to do? i guess you've heard all this a trillion times before.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{and more.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{why didn't you stop me?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well...i don't know.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{how was it the first time you met her?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i thought you'd heard a trillion times }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{this part i'm interested in.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{she had on this little blue suit with a little white collar that had little red piping on it }
<A>__{joe is riveted on parrish ow, parrish aware of him, has paused.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{you could have put her under glass and i would have just stood and looked at her. but when she spoke i loved the sound of her voice and her laugh }
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{ i couldn't get enough of her and gradually or maybe it wasn't gradually i realized i couldn't live without her.}
<A>__{a knock, the door opens and drew enters, looks at parrish, then at joe, stands poised in the doorway.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{may i interrupting?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{'just kidding'?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{sit down, drew.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{before i do }
<P>__{(glances at joe)}
<D>__{i was hoping we might be alone, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{joe and i have no secrets from each other.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{how nice for you both.}
<A>__{drew takes a moment, then plunges in.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{bill, pardon my candor, but i was confounded by your decision this morning.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i was hired, you told me, to help bring parrish communications into the 21st century. this merger is the vehicle }
<A>__{joe interrupts:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{perhaps a merger is a way to bring bill's company into the 21st cen tury. and perhaps it isn't. and perhaps cheating on your french philosophers exam at the groton school was an expedient way to get your diploma, and perhaps it wasn't. be that as it may, drew, a question can often be argued both ways.}
<A>__{drew is stunned.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{joe, cut it out. and you too, drew.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{i thought this was practically a done deal }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{well now it's undone, okay? forget bontecou! scrub him! i'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. i'm not going for it.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{drew heads for the door, turns around.}
<C>__{drew }
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{can i invite myself to dinner tonight?}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{susan and i had ticket for the knicks game. but she said you guys were getting together }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{dinner? absolutely.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{damn decent of you.}
<A>__{drew exits.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be. a man wants to leave something behind. and he wants it left behind the way he made it. and he wants it to be run the way he run it with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. okay?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{and i don't need your goddamn permis sion either! you! drew! i don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{easy, bill. you'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.}
