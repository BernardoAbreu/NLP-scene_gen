<L>__{interior hal's new apartment day}
<A>__{titan's sitting on the floor in a barren apartment wearing his costume top and some tighty whities. he sips his beer as he watches a basketball game on a tiny tv. much to his annoyance, there's a knock at the door.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{oh, for crying out loud.}
<A>__{he gets up and opens the door. it's master mind.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{do you know who i am?}
<A>__{it takes a few moments to register, but titan's suddenly excited.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{yeah, you're master mind. yeah! you're actually the guy i want to see!}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{oh, so now you want to get down to it. well, i want to get a few things off my chest first.}
<A>__{master mind walks past titan into the apartment. he spins around, pointing at him accusingly with one of his metal fingers.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{of all the inconsiderate do you have any idea how long we waited for you? we're you even planning on coming to me and getting revenge?}
<A>__{titan shuts the apartment door, and turns back toward his guest.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{well, at first i was going to. you know, because that's what i figured i was supposed to do. but then i got to thinking }
<C>__{master mind}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{ you got to thinking? there's nothing to think about. i'm the villain. i do something bad, you come and get me.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{ i got to thinking...what's the point?}
<A>__{master mind throws up his hands.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{maybe you're right. what's the point?}
<A>__{he suddenly notices something in the corner of his eye. he walks over to a futon in the living room. on top of it is a large sack overflowing with gold watches,rings and other}
<B>__{valuables.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{what are these?}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{that's what i wanted to talk to you about.}
<C>__{master mind}
<P>__{(baffled)}
<D>__{where did you get all this?}
<C>__{titan}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{get this: i stole them.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{from where?}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{from all over. you see, once you killed pat and ruined my other apartment building i was pretty pissed off, so i figured i'd go, find you and kick some ass. then i thought to myself: "okay,then what?" i mean, if we were to fight, what would i get out of it? would i get my apartment back? would i be able to pay the bills?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{well, what about your mentor?}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{tell you the truth? he was kind of a dick. i mean, being a hero is dandy and all, but it's volunteer work. now you've always had the right take on all this. i mean, when you rob a bank or take over the diamond exchange you get something out of it. i mean, when you don't get caught, which, no offense, isn't very often. and that brings me to what i wanted to propose to you: who could catch you if i'm by your side?}
<A>__{perplexed by his proposal, master mind just stares at titan awe struck.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{you want to team up?}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{you got the brains, i got the brawn. we could even call ourselves that: `brain' and `brawn'. look at this.}
<A>__{titan picks up a piece of poster board off the floor and shows it to master mind.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{i even designed us some new costumes.}
<A>__{the picture is crudely drawn with magic markers and crayons. a big headed man (master mind) is standing on a plate of grass in a blue costume with a picture of a brain on his chest. next to him, is a picture of titan in a red costume with a black cape, but his chest is mysteriously blank. titan proudly points to the two figures.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{see, you'd be brain, so you got a little one on your costume, and then i will have brawn on mine...once i figure out the best, you know, visual interpretation of it. what do you think?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{what do i think?}
<A>__{master mind shakes his head tiredly.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{i think you're probably the biggest idiot i've ever met. i mean, i can't believe you. all your gifts, all your powers, and all you want to use them for is your own financial fulfillment. you know what? your kind of people make me sick.}
<A>__{titan puts down his drawing.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{i worked hard on this.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{oh gee i am so sorry!}
<A>__{master mind looks to heaven in disgust.}
<C>__{master mind }
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{of all the people to pick, it had to be this loser.}
<A>__{this strikes a cord with titan.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{now, hold on. you're going a little too far.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i wish your mother said that to your father the night of your conception, they would have saved me a whole lot of heartache.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{hey, i mean it.}
<A>__{master mind gets right in his face.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{oh, yeah? what are you gonna do?}
