<A>__{bren and mac are seated on the couch. leah is standing nearby for reinforcements. juno paces nervously, trying to suss out how to break the massive news.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i have no idea how to spit this out.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{hon, did you get expelled?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{no. the school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{well, i was just asking. it seemed plausible.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{do you need a large sum of money? legal counsel?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{no, no, i'm definitely not asking for anything. except maybe mercy. like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{what have you done, junebug? did you hit someone with the previa?}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{best to just tell them, man. rip off the band aid and let it bleed.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i'm pregnant.}
<A>__{bren and mac are predictably speechless.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{oh, god...}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{but i'm going to give it up for adoption. i already found the perfect people.}
<A>__{leah presents the penny saver photos of the lornings.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{they say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. i promise this will all be resolved in thirty odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you're pregnant?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i'm so sorry, you guys. if it's any consolation, i have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and i haven't gone number two since wednesday. morning!}
<C>__{bren}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i didn't even know you were sexually active!}
<A>__{juno cringes upon hearing her most hated term.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{who is the kid?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{the baby? i don't know anything about it yet. i only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{nails? really?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{no, i mean the father! who's the father, juno?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{oh. it's, well, it's paulie bleeker.}
<A>__{bren and mac burst into shocked laughter.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{paulie bleeker? i didn't know he had it in him!}
<C>__{bren}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{he just doesn't look, well, virile.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{i know, right?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{okay, this is no laughing matter.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(indignant)}
<D>__{no, it's not. paulie is virile, by the way. he was very good in... chair.}
<A>__{leah fires a be quiet glance at juno.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{did you say you were thinking about adoption?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{we found them in the penny saver by the exotic birds section.}
<A>__{bren looks understandably alarmed. juno hastily attempts to make the situation sound more legitimate.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{but they have a real lawyer and everything. i'm going to meet with them next weekend.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. probably tougher than you can understand right now.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{well, i'm not ready to be a mom.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{damn skippy, you're not! you don't even remember to give liberty bell her breathing meds.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{once! and she didn't die, if you recall!}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{honey, had you considered, you know, the alternative?}
<A>__{leah and juno exchange glances.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{well, you're a brave young lady. you're made of stronger stuff than i thought. you're a little viking!}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{cool it.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{first things first, we have to get you healthy. you need prenatal vitamins. incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. find out where you're going to deliver.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{the term "deliver" is so weird. can we not say "deliver"?}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{how does "crap it out" sound?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{juno, i want to come with you to meet these adoption people. you're just a kid. i don't want you to get ripped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{sure, dad.}
<A>__{mac nods, satisfied, then contemplates the situation dismally.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i have no idea what kind of girl i am.}
<C>__{bren}
<P>__{(sensing tension)}
<D>__{why don't you girls go upstairs for a while? i think mac's gonna blow.}
<A>__{juno and leah hightail it upstairs.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{just tell it to me straight, bren. do you think this is my fault? her mother's fault?}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{i think kids get bored and have intercourse. and i think junebug was a dummy about it. but we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i'm not ready to be a pop pop.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{you're not going to be a pop pop. and juno's not going to be a ma. somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. i friggin' hope.}
<C>__{mac}
<P>__{(conspiratorially)}
<D>__{did you see it coming when she sat us down here?}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{oh god yeah. but i was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{that was my first instinct too. or d.w.i. anything but this. and i'm going to punch that bleeker kid in the weiner the next time i see him.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{oh mac, no! he's a sweet kid. you know it wasn't his idea.}
<A>__{mac shrugs in agreement.}
