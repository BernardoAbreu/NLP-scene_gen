<A>__{wide of the police headquarters on the isle de la cite: a huge bureaucracy. the camera finds javert standing inside looking out of a door leading onto the roof. as he sings he walks out onto the roof and stands by the symbol of the hq, a monumental stone eagle. he looks down at the lights reflected in the river below. then up at the great city. javert too has a god, and this is his prayer.}

<D>__{there, out in the darkness a fugitive running running from god fallen from grace god be my witness i never shall yield till we come face to face till we come face to face... he knows his way in the dark mine is the way of the lord those who follow the path of the righteous shall have their reward and if they fall as lucifer fell the flame! the sword! stars in your multitudes! scarce to be counted filling the darkness with order and light you are the sentinels silent and sure keeping watch in the night keeping watch in the night... you know your place in the sky you hold your course}

<D>__{and your aim and each in your season returns and returns and is always the same and if you fall as lucifer fell you fall in flame! and so it must be, and so it is written on the doorway to paradise that those who falter and those who fall must pay the price! lord, let me find him that i may see him safe behind bars! i will never rest till then! this i swear this i swear by the stars!}
<A>__{javert stands silhouetted against the stars, his arms raised up to the night sky.}
