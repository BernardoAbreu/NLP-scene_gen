<C>__{kat}
<D>__{you're not fooling anyone.}

<A>__{kat steams. and watches him watch the band}
<C>__{kat}
<P>__{(yelling)}

<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{you know, these guys are no bikini kill or the raincoats, but they're right up there.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{you know who the raincoats are?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{why, don't you?}
<A>__{she's completely taken aback. he uses the moment to his advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into her ear.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i watched you out there i've never seen you look like that}
<A>__{kat steps away, brushing the hair back that he just touched her cheeks pinken. his cocky side is back in a flash}

<A>__{he tosses some bills on the bar rather than thank him, kat simply watches him, trying to figure out his motive.}
<C>__{patrick}
<P>__{(continuing; yelling)}
<D>__{nine thirty then.}
<A>__{a few people have gotten between them at the bar and she can't hear a word he's saying. she gives him one last look and heads back into the crowd. patrick smiles. she didn't say no this time.}
