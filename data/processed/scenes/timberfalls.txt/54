<A>__{darryl and lonnie continue along, until... off screen: a loud crack. darryl stops, turns. lonnie looks at daryl.}
<C>__{lonnie}
<D>__{what is it? hear something?}
<A>__{darryl holds his look into the woods, then...}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{nah. it's nothing.}
<A>__{suddenly, mike leaps from behind a tree, whacks the surprised darryl across the face with the stick. darryl drops like a sack of potatoes. mike locks eyes with a terrified lonnie.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{where is she!?}
<A>__{lonnie pauses, frozen. he then takes off, disappearing through the trees. darryl lies on the ground, moaning. he pushes himself up to his knees. blood pours from a fresh gash across his head. mike grabs darryl's shotgun, aims at darryl.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{whoa... take it easy.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{where is she?}

<A>__{mike's finger itches the trigger. he's turning red. breathing hard, heavy. then... mike relents. lowers the weapon, turns his back to darryl, stares into the woods. the tension fades for the moment. but only a moment.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{didn't think you had dat in you, city boy.}
<P>__{(looks at his shirt; the blood)}
<D>__{shit... i just got dis shirt.}

<D>__{any luck, brody's already beat me to it.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sonofabitch!}
<A>__{mike takes a step towards darryl, when... darryl lunges out at mike, pocket knife in hand. darryl misses with his initial swipe, but it's enough to knock mike down, the shotgun falls to the side. darryl pins mike to the ground, tries to dagger the knife into him, but mike grabs his wrist. they struggle. darryl pushes down, the knife inches closer to mike's chest, until... mike head butts darryl, sending the skinny hick off him. darryl rolls away in pain. mike scrambles, crawls for... the shotgun. he grabs it. darryl regroups, turns around, but is met with... whack! mike bashes darryl's face with the butt. this knocks darryl completely out. mike stands over darryl. a beat. then...}
