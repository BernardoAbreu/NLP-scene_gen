<L>__{interior gattaca janitor's locker room. night.}
<A>__{caesar, the old janitor, enters the locker room. he is about to wearily open his locker when he senses another presence in the room. he turns to find jerome sitting there on a bench. although clearly delighted, caesar tries to disguise his pleasure.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{so you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, vincent.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{not yet, i'm afraid.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{no? what's keeping you?}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{i guess i'm a slow learner.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i guess so.}
<P>__{(looking up through the small window)}
<D>__{well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{i will see what i can do.}
<A>__{the two men embrace, caesar breaking off before jerome.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{and don't go getting everybody lost out there. you'll give us a bad name. you won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(glancing to caesar's locker)}
<D>__{by the way, i left some trash in your locker.}
<C>__{caesar}
<P>__{(happy to oblige)}
<D>__{i will take care of it.}
<A>__{jerome departs. caesar watches him go and turns back to his locker. he opens it to find a brand new, high tech telescope sitting inside. the old janitor gets over his surprise and beams broadly he looks back in jerome's direction but he has gone. the old janitor cannot help himself and reverently reaches for the telescope's eyepiece.}
