<L>__{interior charlotte's house night}
<A>__{a fire crackles in the fireplace. a curtain blows in the open window. the door bursts open. windows break. green dragoons pour into the house, muskets brandished. no sign of occupants. captain morrow barks a command:}
<C>__{captain morrow}
<D>__{upstairs!}
<A>__{the dragoons thunder up the stairs... tarleton and wilkins stride in, watching the search... the parlor... nothing... the kitchen... food is cooking... the dining room... the table is set, half eaten food is on the plates, abandoned in mid meal. tarleton walks into the dining room, touches some of the food, gauging its warmth.}
<C>__{tarleton}
<D>__{they can't be far. check the outbuildings and the woods.}
<A>__{the dragoons race outside.}
