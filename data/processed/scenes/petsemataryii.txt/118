<L>__{131 132 exterior countryside day}
<A>__{the ground ahead drops toward a ravine. geoff has nowhere to go but down the slope. clyde is right there beside him... laughing, clyde reaches over and grabs ahold of geoff's handlebar. he jerks it sideways...}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{oops!}
<A>__{geoff's front wheel turns perpendicular. the bike pitches forward, throwing geoff into the dirt ahead... clyde broadies his bike to a stop. with the engine idling, he hops off. before geoff can get to his feet, clyde has picked up geoff's bike and planted it upside down in the dirt.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{guess your dad's not here to save you now, is he?}
<A>__{clyde gets a handful of geoff's collar and drags him over toward the bike. with his free hand, clyde cranks the pedal. the back wheel spins. faster and faster.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{you ever seen a tire take off a nose?}
<A>__{through the blur of the spokes, we see geoff, eyes widening fearfully.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{neither have i.}
<A>__{clyde forces geoff's face toward the spinning tread.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{might even kill ya. wheel might chew right into your brains. you could visit your mom.}
<A>__{geoff tries to get a hold on the frame of the bike for leverage, but his arms don't reach beyond the spinning wheel. clyde is full of deranged glee, fueled by geoff's fear. but now, a hand grabs the wool scarf streaming from the back of clyde's neck and yanks him off of geoff. clyde reels, finding... gus standing there behind him. he looks bad. real bad. his bandages are unwound and his ruined neck is still seeping. his face is unearthly pale. he's deteriorated considerably since yesterday.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{jesus christ, gus!}
<A>__{gus levels a threatening gaze at geoff.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{go home.}
<A>__{but geoff remains frozen. gus fixes him with a stare that could turn flesh to stone.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i said... go home!!}
<A>__{geoff snaps out of it and flips his bike over. he gets a running start, making a beeline for the highway without ever looking back.}
<B>__{on the knoll nearby}
<A>__{drew stops short of the ravine, watching from afar as gus steps toward clyde. below clyde throws up his hands. he's frightened, but he tries to muster up a cocky front.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{come on, gus, i was just fucking with him...}
<P>__{(nervous laughter)}
<D>__{what're you gonna do? give me a ticket? i mean, shit, gus...}
<A>__{clyde grows increasingly wary of gus' evil stare. gus steps closer.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{you can't lay a finger on me...}
<A>__{wrong. gus lashes out, backhanding clyde across the face. clyde falls to the ground, flat on his back, with his nose gushing blood. terrified. gus turns around and lifts the idling motorcycle. with one hand under the back of the seat, and the other working the accelerator handlebar, gus advances toward clyde. gus kicks the bike into gear and revs the accelerator. the rear wheel spins. on the pavement it would be moving forty miles an hour. clyde can't believe his eyes. pleading.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{gus... what are you doing?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i'm just fucking with you...}
<A>__{gus plants his foot against clyde's chest, pinning him, and lowers the spinning rear wheel toward clyde's neck. the wheel whines like a circular saw. gus lowers the wheel. then jerks it away, flashing a sadistic smile. just when clyde thinks gus is backing off, the wheel comes down again...}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(wailing)}
<D>__{stop it, man! stop it!!!}
<A>__{gus gets into the rhythm as he lowers and retracts the spinning wheel at the terrified bully. but this time, as the wheel comes down... clyde's wool scarf, defying gravity, gets swept up, swallowed into the gears. and along with the scarf, here comes clyde's screaming face. we can only imagine the gruesome instant that follows. blood sprays up over gus' arms and chest. and then we hear the sound of crunching bones jamming the motorcycle's gears.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(dead pan)}
<D>__{whoops.}
<A>__{he bares his teeth in a death's head grin.}
<B>__{on the knoll}
<A>__{drew has witnessed the killing. he's mortified. below gus tosses the bloody motorcycle aside, slowly raising his eyes up to where drew stands. his eyes meet drew's. drew hastily jerks his bike around and takes off. gus starts after him on foot.}
