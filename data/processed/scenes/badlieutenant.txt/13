<L>__{int: night ariane's apartment living room}
<A>__{religious hip artifacts abound. it's a nice, if messy apartment. however, it is definitely not large enough to merit the $3,500 that ariane quotes as her rent. ariane is lt's mistress. bowtay, her girlfriend, lounges on the couch. bowtay plays the third when lt is in the mood for a menage a trois. she's around a lot. bowtay is already zonked out on something. maybe ludes.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{got something good for us?}
<A>__{lt gives her the coke. ariane takes some immediately. bowtay sloppily partakes. before lt can even sit down, the girls start bitching.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{i'm gonna need some bread, man. this ain't fair. i'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. my landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! you're two months behind on the rent, lieutenant!}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{it's nothing. this is new york, man...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{oh i forgot. bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. it's a good investment, man. she could make serious money!}
<A>__{angle bowtay on the couch. it's obvious that she's going nowhere. and fast.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{we've been rehearsing a new monologue. from shad's saint joan, you know? bowtay does it wonderfully well.}
<A>__{lt breaks out more coke and some grass.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{all right, bowtay. show us your stuff.}
<A>__{ariane lifts bowtay to her feet. bowtay staggers into the center of the room, then falls back down on her knees. it happens to be appropriate for the scene. bowtay begins to recite the monologue from the very end of the play. "when will the world be ready to receive thy saints?", etc. bowtay messes up a line; ariane lashes her with a belt. bowtay doesn't move, continues reciting. ariane joins in from time to time. lt is turned on. he begins kissing ariane, then goes down onto the floor. bowtay is there already. kinky trio sex scene.}
