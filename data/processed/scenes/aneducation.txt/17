<L>__{exterior street coffee bar. day}
<A>__{jenny, hattie and tina emerge from the cafe, talking.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{well i'm going to be french. i'm going to paris and i'm going to smoke and listen to jacques brel and wear black. and i won't speak. ever. c'est plus chic, comme...}
<A>__{she breaks off. parked outside a tobacconists on the other side of the road is the red bristol. she looks towards the shop, and david emerges with a copy of the times and a packet of cigars. jenny crosses the road to talk to him while the others watch.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{hello. thank you.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{how did it go?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oh, fine. i think. i mean, i didn't mess my bit up, anyway. and no one got thrown out of the orchestra afterwards.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{always the mark of a cultural triumph. listen. i'm glad i ran into you. what are you doing on friday?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{going to school.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i meant the evening.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{oh. yes. of course. nothing.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{because i'm going to listen to some schubert in st john's, smith square. my friends danny and helen will be going too, so it wouldn't be...i will tell you what. i will come and pick you up, and if your mother and father disapprove, then you can have the tickets and go with one of them. how does that sound?}
<A>__{jenny doesn't know what to say. she looks at david, and his eagerness to please seems to convince her.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{thank you. and i'd like you to take me. i'd like to go with someone who knows when to clap.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i usually watch danny. he knows that sort of thing.}
<A>__{jenny smiles.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{seven? and we'll probably go for a spot of supper afterwards, if you...but if you, if that's not...well, we can always put you in a taxi.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(flat disbelief)}
<D>__{supper.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{if you want.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{the trouble is, we'll already have eaten.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well. i mean, if you'd like supper, then, perhaps on friday you could...not eat?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(embarrassed again)}
<D>__{oh. yes. of course.}
<A>__{jenny smiles, and rejoins her friends on the other side of the road. tina and hattie are standing there almost with their mouths open, amazed. she doesn't say anything and starts to walk on.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i just had the strangest dream. i dreamed you crossed the road and spoke to a handsome man with the most beautiful car i've ever seen. and then you came back and you didn't mention it.}
<A>__{jenny smiles enigmatically. tina grabs jenny mock urgently.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{`oo wazzee?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(light, playful)}
<D>__{just a man who's been trying to pick me up. we're going to a concert on friday night. and then we're having a spot of supper.}
<C>__{tina}
<P>__{(shrieking)}
<D>__{a spot of supper?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you've heard of supper?}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{we've heard of it. but we've never eaten it.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{neither of you is interested in the concert part, i notice.}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{no. of course not.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{oh my god! i've only just realised! that's what's going to happen to you, isn't it? look at her! men are going to pick her up in the street and take her out to supper!}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{god, you're right, tina. i hadn't thought of that. look at her.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{don't be so daft.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{we're trying to attract the attention of boys. and she's fighting off men. anyway. you're going to have to tell us more than that.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{because no man's ever going to ask us out to supper. not until we're ladies, anyway. you're going to have to tell us everything. otherwise it's not fair.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{there won't be anything to tell.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{well, make something up, then.}
