<D>__{ a man's feet, in shabby work shoes, stalking through a junk bin in a dark, fire lit, ash dusted place. a huge boiler room is what it is, although we only glimpse it piecemeal. then we see a man's hand, dirty and nail bitten, reach into frame and pick up a piece of metal. another angle as the hand grabs a grimey workglove and slashes at it with a straight razor, until its fingertips are off. close on same hands dumping four fishing knives out of a filthy bag. their blades are thin, curved, gleaming sharp. more angles, even closer. we can hear the man's wheezing breathing, but we still haven't seen his face. we never will. we just see more metal being assembled with crude tools, into some sort of linkage a splayed, spidery sort of apparatus, against a background light of fire, and a deep rushing of steam and heavy, dark energy. and then we see this linkage attached to the glove. then the blades attached to all of it. then the man's hand slips into this glove like apparatus, filling it out and transforming it into an awesome, deadly claw hand with four razor talons gleaming at its blackened fingertips. suddenly the hand arches and strikes forward, slashing through a dark canvas, tearing it to shreds.}

<A>__{suddenly tina's a tiny figure running among huge boilers steam pipes and catwalks a shadowed forest of iron and stone. she stops, listening intently as the sound of tiny hooves suddenly turns into the rattle of distant rain. then she hears ripping fabric. someone is shouldering behind a ragged screen of dirty canvas, approaching tina. closer on the canvas. the long curved fingerblades suddenly punch through, flashing in the firelight, and begin ripping through the thick fabric, as easily as scalpels through flesh. they make a hideous, extended ripping sound. tina rushes away, hands over her ears. another angle as the blinded girl stumbles backwards. then the canvas flaps free. the blades are gone. the titles end, and everything goes silent. camera circles until tina's looking right into our eyes. the light from a nearby boiler pours through her thin night dress, leaving her naked and vulnerable. then a deep, ragged voice whispers at her as camera closes in on her face.}

<A>__{suddenly nancy feels utterly exposed. she shivers, chilled and vulnerable to the bone in her thin night clothes. she can't move. it's as if some great nerve between her instincts and body had been severed. and she hears the sound behind her. a sort of filling vibrating scrriiitchh . music sneaks in the unmistakeable nightmare theme, creeping over her. nancy forces herself, by sheer will, to look. ahead of her perhaps twenty five feet, covered with a thick plastic body bag through which we can barely see her face, is tina. standing square in the middle of the street. a dark ooze of black eels roil out of its bottom, and at its top, the zipper chatters down and the greenish white face of tina lolls out. she gestures, supplicating, her watery eyes desperate to convey some desperate message. the music falls to a hush. nancy backs away, eyes streaming tears.}

<A>__{moving with nancy at full gallop, running blind. she crashes through a sawhorse into a new sidewalk, sinking into the wet cement over her ankles. the stuff sticks to her legs in long gluey globs and she can barely pull her feet loose. the killer looms nearby, mocking her his scalpel claws gleaming in the streetlight. he just misses the girl as she wrenches free and flees again, now so winded she can only stagger. moving with them. time after time nancy just barely manages to elude the shadowy form, leaping from his reach by inches and pouring on more steam. it's too close to even bother screaming now; and besides, that would take breath she doesn't have. the only sound is of running footsteps, rasping breath and the knife fingers whistling through the air.}

<D>__{glennn!!!}
<A>__{but her voice is garbled as if she's under water, and there's no answer. the only clue to glen being there at all is his distant snoring. innocent. persistent. deep. nancy stops, breath in shreds, face smeared with dirt and tears. something is clawing the window in the dark of the kitchen. nancy looks and catches the man prying at the glass with his big knife fingers, the sharp blades sizzling against the edges of the glass as they crack it away from the frame. nancy runs upstairs in blind panic.}

<A>__{nancy darts into her unlit bedroom, slams the door and locks it. safe at last. she listens at the door. nothing. she crosses to her bed. next second the killer dives through her window and seizes her in a shower of shattered glass ! nancy twists and manages to grab the wrist of his knife hand with both of hers, barely keeping the blades from her throat. the two fall backwards in a terrible, gasping struggle, crashing onto nancy's bed. her grip is broken the man stabs nancy twists away, backed into a corner of bed and walls. defenseless, she snatches a pillow up; the killer lashes out disemboweling the pilow and sending a great gush of feathers flying. nancy dives for escape in a virtual blizzard. the killer manages to snare her with his other hand, and the two crash across the bedside table to the floor, the table and all its contents cascading around them in a whiteout of feathers. angle at floor level close on nancy's and the killer's heads. the blades inch towards the girl's face the drool of the grizzled shadow with the horribly scarrred face spills into her eyes. feathers are everywhere; music is absolutely insane! but just when the points of steel are less than an inch from her eyes, the old fashioned alarm clock thrown to the floor next to nancy's head goes off with a jarring ringgggggg! instantly the music stops. and a moment later the room is light. wider as nancy reels up, blinded by the sudden light, screaming and fighting on her bed . angle on glen, lurching from his own sleep at the frightening noise. he discovers nancy pressed in terror against her headboard, clutching a pillow like a drowning woman would a straw. it's an intact pillow, and there isn't a feather in sight. nancy stares incredulously at glen, then around the room, untangling herself from her bedclothes. wary and furious, her voice hoarse.}
