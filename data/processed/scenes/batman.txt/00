<L>__{exterior cityscape night}
<A>__{the place is gotham city. the time, 1987 once removed. the city of tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows, dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and concrete, self generating, almost subterranean in its aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and kept on growing. a dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready to burst.}
<L>__{exterior cathedral night}
<A>__{amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate gothic anomaly: old city cathedral, once grand, now abandoned long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition. on the rooftop far above us, stone gargoyles gaze down from their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the gotham night. one of them is moving.}
<L>__{exterior gotham square night}
<A>__{the pulsing heart of downtown gotham, a neon nightmare of big city corruption, almost surreal in its oppressiveness. hookers wave to drug dealers. street hustlers slap high fives with three card monte dealers. they all seem to know each other... with one conspicuous exception: a tourist family, mom, dad, and little jimmy, staring straight ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the main drag. they've just come out of a bit show two blocks over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and now playbills in hand they find themselves adrift in the predatory traffic of gotham's meanest street.}

<D>__{taxi!!}
<A>__{three cabs streak pass and disappear. mom grimaces in frustration as little jimmy consults a subway map.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{we're going the wrong way.}
<A>__{nearby, street types are beginning to snicker. dad surveys them nervously, gestures toward the subway map.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{put that away. we'll look like tourists.}
<A>__{two cops lean on their patrol car outside an all night souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a hooker. the hooker smiles at jimmy. jimmy smiles back. mom yanks him off down the street and glowers at dad.}
<C>__{dad }
<D>__{we'll never get a cab here. let's cut over to seventh.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{seventh is that way.}
