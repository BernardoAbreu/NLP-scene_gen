<A>__{starks walks into the bathroom, keenly eyeing the thin slit of windows at the top of the wall. he walks closer to them, when he suddenly hears some strained breathing from inside one of the stalls. he checks the first stall, pushing it open. it swings both ways since it doesn't have a lock. the sound continues. starks walks slowly past the second stall to the third and then... whack! the door swings all the way towards starks. brutally. he falls backwards his head just barely missing a fatal confrontation with the sink. damon, the orderly, walks out.}

<D>__{i'm sorry, starks. must have not seen you coming there.}
<A>__{starks writhes in pain straining for his own breath now.}
<D>__{damon [leaning down close to him] were you worried about me? [smiling] that's so sweet. thanks.}
<A>__{with that, damon walks out, leaving starks on the floor.}
