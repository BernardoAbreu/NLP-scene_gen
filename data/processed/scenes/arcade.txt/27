<L>__{interior alex's room night}
<A>__{alex flies back from the t.v. screen, violently ripping the goggles and cybergloves off. but the shriek is continuing and then she realizes that... the phone is ringing. alex stops shaking. the phone continues to ring. she's back in her room. everything's fine. normal. she glances at the game.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{we see the black again, black with sparks racing past. benign. alex reaches over and picks up the phone, all the while keeping her eyes glued to the screen.}

<D>__{listen to me! greg never came home. i think the game has something to do with it.}
<C>__{nick }
<P>__{(filtered)}
<D>__{what the hell are you talking about?}
<A>__{alex continues to watch the television screen, almost mesmerized by the flickering sparks. her eyes begin to glaze over...}
<C>__{nick }
<P>__{(filtered)}
<D>__{you there? hello?}
<A>__{alex snaps out of it, tearing her gaze from the screen}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i have to talk to you.}

<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm coming over.}
<A>__{alex quickly hangs up the phone and moves back to the television. she reaches for the control box and hits the "off" switch. nothing happens. sparks continue to shoot across the screen. alex tries it again. same result.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{shit...}
<A>__{again and again she hits the button, but nothing is happening. alex reaches behind the t.v., grabs hold of the electrical cords, and}
<B>__{yanks.}
<A>__{the fucking cord won't come out! and then she hears it, an electronic whisper, both seductive and horrific.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{alex...}
<A>__{with all her might, alex pulls on the cords. pop! they fling out of the t.v. and the screen goes dead. alex sits back against the wall for a moment, catching her breath and trying to calm the rising hysteria within her.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{okay...don't think about it...}
<P>__{(deep breath)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{alex stands up, grabbing her coat off the bed.}
