<A>__{the elevator opens and kobayashi is greeted by keaton and verbal. mcmanus drops from the ceiling hatch and pushes him out. verbal and mcmanus grab the dead bodies and drag them out of the elevator. they drag them to the next elevator which has been forced open, revealing an empty shaft.}

<C>__{kobayashi}
<D>__{mr. soze will be most }
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{listen to me, cocksucker. there is no keyser sate. if you say his name again, i'11 kill you right here.}

<D>__{a strange threat. i can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. pity about mr. redfoot. mcmanus fair trade for fenster.}
<A>__{the elevator opens and hockney steps out.}
<C>__{kobayashi}

<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{neither do we. mcmanus you got fenster, you may get more, but you won't get us all. not before one of us gets to you.}
