<L>__{interior volvo night}
<A>__{malcolm drives quickly with pauline next to him. he's smoking with the window open, dick and margot in the backseat.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{margot used to never speak. i remember when we went on a double date in high school, that kid ron asked you if english was your first language.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{it's true. i used to think i might have some kind of brain defect.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you thought you were aphasic.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i'm still not sure.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{oh, jesus, margot.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{it's very possible, paul.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i just...your diagnoses sometimes irk the hell out of me.}
<A>__{malcolm lights another cigarette the car jerks sideways.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{malcolm, can you slow down.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i can drive if you like.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{no, you got dinner, the driving's on me.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{well, i will let you pay your half if you'll slow down.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{well, neither pauline or i ordered dessert.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{malcolm, let it go.}
<P>__{(taunting)}
<D>__{margot would insist on driving if she knew how.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(to dick)}
<D>__{my license elapsed. but i know how.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it's probably for the best. i have this theory, i think, historically, women have been held back in so many ways that when they get power, like they do behind the wheel, they can't help but abuse it. it's akin to hannah arendt's eichmann theory about prison guards and prisoners switching rolls.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{that's a charming philosophy.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{yeah. tell that one a lot.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{this isn't a blanket thing. i mean, women can be great drivers too...}
<A>__{he takes a long satisfied drag on his cigarette.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{said the man with the moustache that he thinks he's wearing in quotes.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{it's meant to be funny.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(to pauline, re: margot)}
<D>__{are you doing this for her benefit or mine?}
<A>__{malcolm pumps the brake.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what the fuck?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(momentarily sober)}
<D>__{no, there they go. okay. it's fine. i thought i had no brakes for a minute...}
<A>__{malcolm pitches his cigarette out the window it flies through margot's window and lands on her lap.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{malcolm!}
<A>__{dick grabs the lit butt and chucks it in the road.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(turning around)}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{the car swerves again everyone jumps.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{watch it!}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it's fine, margot!}
<C>__{pauline}
<P>__{(to malcolm)}
<D>__{you're just so incompetent.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{why don't you fucking drive yourselves home!}
<A>__{malcolm screeches the vehicle over to the shoulder. they jolt to a stop.}
<C>__{pauline}
<P>__{(quietly furious)}
<D>__{oh, god.}
<A>__{pauline opens the door and staggers toward the brush. she leans against a tree and looks like she might vomit. malcolm watches in the rearview mirror.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you should go after her.}
<A>__{malcolm sighs heavily and gets out of the car. margot and dick watch out the back window. pauline sees malcolm coming and bolts into the woods. malcolm charges after her.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{come back with me tonight.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i've got claude.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{come on, i've been trying to get you up here all year.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(vaguely)}
<D>__{she's pregnant.}
<A>__{dick leans over to margot's neck. he licks her.}
