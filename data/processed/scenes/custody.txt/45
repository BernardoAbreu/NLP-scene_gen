<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior theater continuous}
<A>__{rick enters on stage. the entire theater is cast in shades of gray. the stage is barren. there is no audience. he looks around for a moment and as he reaches center stage is once again flooded with the spotlight. rick uses his arm to shade his eyes. sfx: a soft din of voices. looking stage left rick realizes twelve jurors have appeared in their box. a small audience has congregated. sfx: the din swells to a quiet chaos. a rapping of a gavel and rick's attention swings to a white haired judge (70's).}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{order in the court.}
<A>__{the noise level wanes, but not completely. another rap of the gavel.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{order in the court, i say.}
<A>__{focused on the judge, rick doesn't notice the prosecutor approaching from stage right. carrying a folding chair in one hand, notes and manila folders in the other, he sets the chair behind rick.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{have a seat.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{do you know why you're here today, mr. stevens?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{why am i here?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{are you being rhetorical?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{are you asking me?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{you stand here today an accused man.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{accused? accused of what?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{you have been placed in custody of your children.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{your children, mr. stevens. you do realize you have children, don't you?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{yes, but...}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{but nothing mr. stevens, either you have children or you don't.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{so, you accept responsibility for bringing young life into the world?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i guess...}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{there's no guessing, mr. stevens, either you're responsible for siring offspring or you aren't.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i am, but i'm not sure it was responsible.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{a crime of passion, mr. stevens? how convenient.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{and you accept the consequences of said actions?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{why am i here?}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{why are you here, mr. stevens? why are you here? i will tell you why you're here. are you familiar with ms. cynthia stevens?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{yeah, she's my wife.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{was your wife, sir. was your wife. she recently filed for divorce. were you aware of that?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{no, no i wasn't.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{well, she did. she also named you as her coconspirator in the act of having children. were you aware of that, mr. stevens?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{again, no.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{mr. stevens, you just told the court that you aware you had children. you have also admitted that ms. cynthia stevens was, in fact, your wife.}
<C>__{prosecutor }
<D>__{on top of that you told this court that you accepted the responsibility of having said children, did you not?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{yes, but...}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{then why, mr. stevens, do you continue to deny culpability in this situation?}
<A>__{rick realizes the audience has swelled to nearly a full house. beads of sweat form on his brow.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{answer the question.}
<C>__{audience}
<D>__{answer the question.}
<A>__{like a trapped animal, rick looks for his escape.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{the question, mr. stevens.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{how can you be sure it was me?}
<A>__{the audience hisses. the judge raps his gavel.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{she picked you out of a lineup, sir. what more do you need?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{time.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{time is not an option, mr. stevens. time is not an option.}
<A>__{a look of sad resignation crosses rick's face.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{you don't deny being married to ms. stevens, nor do you deny the act of procreation. you seem to understand that your actions bear consequence. you seem to understand that with parenthood, came responsibility.}
<P>__{(mor e)}
