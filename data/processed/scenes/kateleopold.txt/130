<A>__{kate sits at the dinning room table behind empty sara lee boxes, pints of ice cream, beer bottles, and is working her way through the cookie dough. leopold enters through the front door, disheveled.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{good god. look at you. you look awful.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you should see what i'm looking at.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i went back to the restaurant. they told me you went out looking for me right after i left.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{that was pound cakes ago. where were you?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i had a lot to think over.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{such as?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{just where i stand around here.}
<A>__{there is a long pause.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{we should have come up with something together. i might have been spared ten or seventy pounds.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{is that an apology?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm sorry for what i said.}
<A>__{leopold goes to her. he gently prys cookie dough from her hands.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i'm not going anywhere.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{yes you are...}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i'm not going. i'm staying here with you.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{but? you can't! we have no right to...}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{it is my destiny. it is my decision.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{have you thought about what you'd be sacrificing? your influence? your authority?}
<A>__{they kiss.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{your family, your whole way of life, everything?}
<A>__{they kiss.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you're not just feeling sorry for me because i ate the contents of the refrigerator, are you?}
<A>__{they kiss.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i love you, kate. the single most miraculous event in my life was not how i arrived here, but that when i did, i found you.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(overwhelmed)}
<D>__{here comes the mushy part!}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{after much consideration i've come to the conclusion i no longer desire a large estate with a full staff and ornate grounds.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{that's good, because if you're staying i will probably get fired again. what do you desire?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{a beautiful wife, a small home in the middle of nowhere, lots of children, and fine schools with pms meetings every other sunday.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{...pta?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{pta.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i love you too. i do, leopold. i love you, too.}
<A>__{they kiss.}
