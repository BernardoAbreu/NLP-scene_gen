<L>__{interior charlie's office day}
<A>__{this is a big corner room, the windows of which look out over the main street. the chairs are big and there is a roll top desk in the corner, a big leather sofa, and on the walls some framed pictures. at a table prince sits. he has six dice stacked on top of each other and he is lifting the column. charlie is seated behind the desk smiling. haven looks from one to the other.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(to prince)}
<D>__{you wanted to see me?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{they said charlie }
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{she seems to enjoy haven's momentary confusion. prince is indifferent.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you're charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's right.}
<P>__{(nods toward prince)}
<D>__{this is prince. don't ever gamble with him.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you mean with his equipment?}
<A>__{prince gives him a thin smile and rises.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{she means either.}
<P>__{(he crosses to door)}
<D>__{see you later, charlie.}
<A>__{prince saunters out. haven sits in a big chair, very gingerly; takes out his pipe and tobacco.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you surround yourself with very affable characters.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it makes me feel at home.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you're not that sinister. last night with the wet towels you were florence nightingale in silk stockings.}
<P>__{(stretching his legs, looking at her)}
<D>__{have you got a match?}
<A>__{she comes over with one and lights his pipe.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{there's one in my pocket but i hate to reach for it... thanks.}
<A>__{she takes his hand and looks at the cut knuckle.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{sit there.}
<A>__{she walks out of the room and he watches her; then around the room. in a moment she returns, pulls up a chair in the front of him and sits down. she has bandages and a little jar of ointment.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{now you're florence nightingale again.}
<A>__{she takes one of his bruised hands, and as she bandages his hands slowly, carefully and rather expertly, they talk.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{why did you pick that fight?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i thought you did.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you could have insisted i was your cousin.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{perhaps that isn't the way i felt about you.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(as his knuckle hurts)}
<D>__{ouch!}
<A>__{she smiles at him and then goes on.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{where did you get the name of charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it was my father's. my name is charlene, but }
<A>__{he watches her face.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i like that better... charlene...}
<P>__{(she doesn't answer)}
<D>__{this'll be the first time i ever worked for a woman.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(giving him a glance)}
<D>__{what makes you think you're going to work for me?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you sent for me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(finishing the bandage)}
<D>__{how's that?}
<A>__{she stands up. haven looks at her and ignores his bandaged hands.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{beautiful.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(walking towards the window)}
<D>__{all right, i sent for you. i was doing a nice quiet business. that was because everybody was afraid of mick. now every time a man has enough drinks in him to feel rugged he'll try to do what you did.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i wouldn't.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{but they will.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{that's not the job i want. i don't intend to start at the bottom. i've been there. it's too crowded.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{where do you want to start?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{with the money.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and what will you do for it?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{anything except hang. how did you get all this?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i learned one thing from my father. as long as men think they can beat the tables, all you have to do is get a table. sometimes they run out of cash and i find myself with new responsibilities.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{such as }
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{a couple of stores for one thing.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i can't see myself behind a counter.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{a sawmill, and a logging camp. the logging camp's a long way from town.}
<A>__{haven gets the meaning and shakes his head.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i own the stage line from here to west rim city, but that's a dud.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{outlaws. the money was in gold shipments. now the mines won't ship it.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i will take that job.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you mean ride shot gun?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i mean run the line.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{don't force your luck. you won a fight last night. you could lose one tonight.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{today i'd hate to tangle with a butterfly.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what do you think you'll get out of running the stage line?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{a commission on all the gold i get through.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that should buy you a small beer.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{glad to get it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's pretty dangerous. even wells fargo locked up their station and quit trying.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(leveling)}
<D>__{who steals the gold?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{who doesn't? all they have to do is put a mask on and they all look like black bart.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{give me a letter of authorization.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(going to the desk)}
<D>__{i can't bet against you twice, can i?}
<A>__{as she writes out the authorization, haven saunters to the window, then over to the desk. charlie finishes and hands him the paper. haven scans it, pockets it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(smiling at him)}
<D>__{you know i forgot to ask you one thing.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i'm working for you now. you can ask me anything.}
<A>__{haven is moving to the door and she beside him. they pause.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{how do i know i can trust you?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you don't.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{can i?}
<A>__{he looks at her face, neck and hair. she looks pretty good.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{only with money.}
<A>__{haven looks squarely at her a moment, then smiles. he reaches out one bandaged hand and pats her shoulder.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{okay, boss?}
<A>__{he walks out, and charlie remains standing there, staring after him, just a little hazily.}
