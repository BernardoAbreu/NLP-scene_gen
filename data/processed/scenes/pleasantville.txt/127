<A>__{betty sits in a comer of the shop, next to the gray bowl of fruit. she holds her head to the side, sitting gracefully with her chin in the air. mr. johnson sits behind his easel, painting her portrait from a few feet away. betty looks radiant with no trace of the makeup, the warm pink of her flesh tones lit softly by a bare forty watt bulb ...}

<A>__{betty looks back at mr. johnson and suddenly sees the painting. she flinches for a second. her eyes go wide.}
<B>__{reverse angle. including the painting.}
<A>__{it is cubist (like the rest of his recent work) but that isn't the shocking part. even though she sits in front of him fully clothed, mr. johnson has painted a beautiful, sensual nude. betty just stares at the canvas, stunned to see herself revealed like that. the colors are all hot pinks and oranges and yellows like some fauvist celebration of summertime. there is another even louder peel of thunder.}

<A>__{she looks over at mr. johnson and he glances down. after a moment or two he looks back at her, but she doesn't turn to run. betty just stares at him, then without even realizing it, moves slightly closer.}
