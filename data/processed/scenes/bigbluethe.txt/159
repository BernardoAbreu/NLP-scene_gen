<A>__{enzo is preparing. he sits at the edge of the platform hyperventilating, almost in a trance. we see jacques in the background, talking to novelli, he then walks over to enzo and climbs down next to him.}

<D>__{we can't dive anymore. they want to cancel the competition for a while.}

<D>__{it's not safe, they say. the doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live. free diving is over as a sport.}

<D>__{you say that because you have the title!}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{no! i would never cheat you.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{well that's very nice of you.}
<A>__{he takes a last breath, signs himself and reaching for the gueuse, disappears into the water. lawrence, novelli, the medics, and others are arguing. lawrence is furious that enzo is diving. novelli is balling out his assistants. jacques is on the platform watching the others as if they were a gaggle of geese. he listens to the sound of the gueuse playing out, watches the depth indicator, the stopwatches. he knows something is wrong. he walks over to the edge and grabs hold of a little oxygen bottle which is there for security. he takes a few breaths of the oxygen as he puts on his flippers and dives down after enzo. underwater jacques jacques pulls himself down the cable, hand over hand.}
