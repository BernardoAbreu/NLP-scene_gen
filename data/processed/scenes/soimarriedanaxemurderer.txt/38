<L>__{exterior harriet's apartment building day}
<A>__{charlie enters the building, holding a handful of poetry books. he passes a uniformed delivery guy coming out. the guy nods and charlie nods back.}
<L>__{interior harriet's apartment building continuous}
<A>__{charlie gets three feet down the hallway. stops in his tracks and heads back to the front door. he opens it and yells to the delivery guy:}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey, uh... ralph...?}
<C>__{delivery guy}
<P>__{(turning around)}
<D>__{i'm gilbert.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{harriet's door moments later she opens the door enough to see that she is wearing only a blouse that goes below her hips. she looks fantastic. he hands her the poetry books.}
<C>__{harriet}
<P>__{(teasing him)}
<D>__{charlie, they're beautiful. i will put them right in water.}
<A>__{he follows her inside and puts the books on the bureau. he goes over and kisses her.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you look great.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{i was just getting dressed.}
<P>__{(picking up skirt off couch)}
<D>__{what do you think of this skirt?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{honestly?}
<P>__{(pulls her close)}
<D>__{i'd leave it off.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{so then you think i could go to a poetry concert like this?}
<A>__{she drops the skirt and stands there. she's fantastic.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{let's forget the poetry concert. it's already been nine hours since i last made love to you.}
<C>__{harriet}
<P>__{(smiling; walking away)}
<D>__{come on we're meeting your best friend. i wanna look good. the second i go to the ladies room he's gonna tell you what he really thinks of me.}
<A>__{he follows her to the bedroom door, constantly trying to kiss her.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{come on, charlie. we have to be there in fifteen minutes.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(following her into bedroom)}
<D>__{fifteen minutes. perfect.}
<A>__{she closes the door on his face.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(through door)}
<D>__{maybe later.}
<C>__{rose }
<D>__{i thought of calling you.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{aaaahhh!}
<A>__{charlie turns on his heel. rose has appeared out of nowhere.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{to warn you, charlie.}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{there are just some things you should know, about harriet.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{about harriet?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{about her past.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't wanna know. i mean, look everyone has some skeletons in their past. i only care about the future. not the past.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{here's the thing. i may have to tell harriet.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{tell her what?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{that we're lovers.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we're not lovers.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i know, and it's a damn shame.}
<A>__{harriet walks in the room, fully dressed, and fully dazzling.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{i hope i'm not interrupting.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(feeling weird)}
<D>__{no, not at all. we were just talking about... rose and i met yesterday, so...}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{so i heard.}
<A>__{harriet hugs rose and then stands right next to her.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{so, don't you think we look alike?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{oh, we do not. harriet was always prettier than me. and a heck of a lot more popular. she always had boyfriends. the only thing i ever got was good grades.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(slightly uncomfortable)}
<D>__{good grades are good.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{she's just being kind. show charlie one of your photographs, rose. rose is a great artist.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{no, harriet. i don't want to. they're not good.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{you're so modest. if i weren't here to brag for you, i just don't know...}
<P>__{(taking out a}
<D>__{posterboard from}
<P>__{cabinet)}
<D>__{show it to him, rose. do it.}
<A>__{he turns it over and there is a picture there. a collage of unrelated images put together. and it is beautiful. but it's very abstract. violent perhaps. confused definitely. he likes it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's beautiful...}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i dunno.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what do you call it?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i dunno.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{a lot artists don't like to title their work. they feel it biases the viewer.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{it is titled. it's called "i dunno".}
<A>__{charlie looks at it again, then at rose, then at harriet. it's all a little bizarre, but in a funny way he feels for rose. a hidden talented overshadowed by her sister's beauty.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{we should get going, charlie. thanks, rose... see you later.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{bye, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{rose, great to see you. we should all go out together some time. the three of us. that would be great. that would be... interesting.}
<A>__{charlie and harriet walk out.}
