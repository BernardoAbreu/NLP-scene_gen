<A>__{broken whiskey bottles litter the floor. chris may well have found his new home. the bus is outfitted with a bunk and a barrel stove. previous visitors had left it stocked with matches, bug dope, and other essentials.}

<A>__{we follow chris back out of the bus, surveying the area of the clearing. he loves what he sees.}

<A>__{he runs up a berm to look down into the river. he runs from corner to corner of this "magic bus" area like a new bride surveying her honeymoon suite with glee. he climbs a tree, swings from its branch, doing a flip in the air, landing on his feet, but then slipping on the snow and onto his butt and then onto his back. he grabs a handful of snow, shoves it in his mouth, melts it into water, and swallows it. crane shot: we pull up from chris to high above the clearing.}
