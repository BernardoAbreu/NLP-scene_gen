<A>__{he slams the car door after her. as the car pulls out his look travels with it and then lingers up the street, caught on: a ford taurus, parked, dark. harry hesitates, then starts walking up the street towards the parked car. when he has taken several steps the ignition is turned in the car. a shape briefly visible in the driver's seat is lost when the headlights flash on. the car pulls out from the curb into a u turn and drives away. harry watches the tail lights recede.}
