<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{tell me you're not taking this seriously.}
<C>__{craig gregory}
<D>__{yeah, that's why we brought the entire company in from the road because we're not taking this seriously.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{it doesn't make any sense. it's...}
<P>__{(searching)}
<D>__{... completely impersonal.}
<C>__{craig gregory}
<D>__{who am i even talking to?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{there's a methodology to what i do. a reason why it works.}
<C>__{craig gregory}
<D>__{ryan, coke and ibm have been doing it for years. just like anything, there's a few months of transition, but everyone settles in.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{who are you taking off the road?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{craig gregory}
<D>__{you don't get it. you're grounded, ryan. everyone is. it's done.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{okay, what we do here is brutal and leaves people devastated, but there's a dignity to the way i do it.}
<C>__{craig gregory}
<D>__{stabbing people in the chest instead of the back?}
<A>__{ryan rolls his eyes. craig's door opens and natalie pops her head in.}

<P>__{(to natalie)}
<D>__{look, i appreciate your... zeal. and you have some good ideas. but you know nothing of the realities of my job. sure, you can set up an ichat... but you don't know how people think.}

<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{my name is miss keener and i'm here today to discuss your future.}
<C>__{ryan}

<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{natalie}
<P>__{(breaks the moment)}
<D>__{this is a mythical situation. how could i possibly know why?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{you never know why. why doesn't matter.}
<C>__{natalie}
<P>__{(back on track)}
<D>__{it's important not to focus on the "why" and rather to spend your energy thinking about your future.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i'm going to spend my energy on suing you if you don't give me a reason that you're firing me.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{mr. bingham, the reason is not important.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{oh, so you're firing me without grounds.}
<P>__{(to craig)}
<D>__{now, i really have a lawsuit.}
<C>__{craig gregory}
<D>__{ryan, i think we know what you're trying to say...}
<C>__{natalie}
<P>__{(still in character)}
<D>__{don't take this personally, mr. bingham.}
<A>__{ryan stops.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{personally?}
<P>__{(quiet and calm)}
<D>__{this is the most personal situation you will ever enter. so before you try to revolutionize my business, i'd like to know that you actually know my business.}
