<L>__{interior hospital, montreuil night}
<A>__{the hospital is in the long attic of valjean's factory. valjean hurries into the hospital, breathless. he sees a nursing sister outside fantine's room.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{is her daughter with her?}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{no, monsieur. her guardian sent this.}
<A>__{she gives valjean a note. he reads it with mounting anger.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{`money not enough. send more. thenardier.' what sort of man is this?}
<L>__{interior hospital, montreuil night}
<A>__{fantine lies in bed, delirious. she is dressed in pure white. her eyes are closed.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{cosette, it's turned so cold! cosette, it's past your bedtime! you've played the day away and soon it will be night.}
<A>__{fantine's eyes open and she sees cosette, playing in the room. she looks healthy and is dressed prettily.}
<D>__{come to me, cosette, the light is fading.}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{fantine }
<D>__{don't you see, the evening star appearing? come to me, and rest against my shoulder, how fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder?}
<A>__{valjean enters, and sees at once that fantine is close to the end. he drops to his knees by her bed.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{dear fantine, cosette will be here soon! dear fantine, she will be by your side}
<C>__{fantine}
<P>__{(trying to get out of bed)}
<D>__{come cosette, the night has grown so cold!}
<C>__{valjean}
<P>__{(putting her back in bed)}
<D>__{be at peace! be at peace ever more.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{my cosette }
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{ shall live in my protection.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{take her now!}
<A>__{she pushes into his hand a scrap of paper on which she's written her wishes.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{your child will want for nothing.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{good m'sieur, you come from god in heaven.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{and none shall ever harm cosette as long as i am living.}
<A>__{fantine has stopped looking towards the window. all her fading strength is now directed towards valjean. she tries to reach up to him.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{take my hand... the night grows ever colder.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{then i will keep you warm.}
<A>__{he wraps her in his arms.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{take my child i give her to your keeping.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{take shelter from the storm.}
<C>__{fantine}
<D>__{for god's sake, please stay till i am sleeping... and tell cosette i love her and i will see her when i wake...}
<A>__{fantine starts to spasm. she sees something over valjean's shoulder. valjean doesn't realise. her eyes go glassy as she passes away. valjean then hears the unforgettable voice of javert behind him.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{valjean, at last we see each other plain! `m'sieur le mayor' you'll wear a different chain!}
<A>__{valjean stands to face javert.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{before you say another word, javert, before you chain me up like a slave again, listen to me! there is something i must do. this woman leaves behind a suffering child. there is none but me who can intercede in mercy's name, three days are all i need, then i will return, i pledge my word! then i will return...}
<A>__{javert draws his sword and aims it at valjean.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{you must think me mad! i've hunted you across the years. men like you can never change a man such as you!}
<A>__{valjean breaks a section of timber beam from the roof. the men start to circle each other. they sing at the same time, duelling in song.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{believe of me what you will there is a duty that i'm sworn to do. you know nothing of my life all i did was steal some bread. you know nothing of the world you would sooner see me dead. but not before i see this justice done!}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{men like me can never change. men like you can never change. no, 24601! my duty is to the law. you have no rights. come with me, 24601!}
<A>__{the two men fight.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{i am warning you, javert, i'm a stronger man by far! there is power in me yet! my race is not yet run!}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{now the wheel has turned around jean valjean is nothing now. dare you talk to me of crime and the price you had to pay. every man is born in sin every man must choose his way.}
<A>__{javert disarms valjean and drives him backwards towards an attic door.}
<D>__{you know nothing of javert! i was born inside a jail. i was born with scum like you. i am from the gutter too.}
<A>__{valjean is pushed through the doors out onto a wooden loading platform beneath a hoist. below, the walls of the factory lead straight down to the black sea at high tide. javert is triumphant. valjean glances down and pushes back, dropping into the darkness of the ocean. javert goes to jump after him and cannot bring himself to do it. javert stares into the black sea there is no sign of valjean.}
