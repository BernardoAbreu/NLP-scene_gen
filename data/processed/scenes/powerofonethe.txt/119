<A>__{pk runs through the empty cell blocks looking for some one. pk runs through the corridors. he runs through the kitchens, the empty dining area, the sound of the concert chasing after him. he runs through the recreation area and past the boxing room when he hears a thud, and another.}
<L>__{interior boxing room}
<A>__{he bolts into the room and hits the light switch. the light over the ring comes on, illuminating bormann, truncheon raised over the lifeless, broken body of geel piet.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{startled, bormann jumps out of the ring and runs off. pk scrambles into the ring and cradles the lifeless, blood ied head in his lap, and begins to sob. pan down along geel piet's arm to his bloodied hand, holding the snapshot of him and pk. the concerto grows louder around pk until it enfolds him in its melodies. the voices of africa, the music of europe, reaching for a musical and spiritual crescendo.}
<C>__{pk }
<D>__{geel piet died of massive internal hemorrhage, the result of bormann's ramming a truncheon up into the little man's body until his entrails spilled out. when i reached him he was already dead. i sat there crying, stroking his head and crying with african voices rising to heaven above, even as her blood soaked the ground below.}
<A>__{the music swells until the voices meld as one.}
