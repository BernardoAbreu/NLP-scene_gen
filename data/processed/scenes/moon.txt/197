<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{sam, this is not going to work.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{what? why not?}
<A>__{now sam 2 loads food into the cargo container moon snacks, rations, etc. and bottles of water. his final addition is a 5 kilo load of precious helium3; a good 15 million dollars worth!}

<D>__{if the rescue unit examine my memory banks they will discover what has taken place over the last week. as you know i record everything. if they are suspicious, the first thing they will do is search my memory banks, and this would put you in considerable danger.}
<A>__{sam 2 straightens up, giving gerty his full attention now. this is serious. it could ruin everything. the fact that gerty has brought it up indicates that the robot's loyalties lie ultimately with sam.}
<C>__{gerty }
<D>__{i recommend erasing my memory banks. i can reboot myself once you have departed.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{so that's what we're going to have to do.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you ok with that?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{i will require your assistance, sam.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{sure, just let me finish this.}
<A>__{sam 2 continues his work.}
