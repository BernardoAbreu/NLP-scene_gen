<D>__{malcolm his voice the white people who are guilty of white supremacy try and hide their own guilt by accusing the honorable elijah muhammad of teaching black supremacy when he tries to uplift the mentality, the social, and economic condition of black people in this country. and the jews, who have been guilty of exploiting the black people economically, civilly, and otherwise, hide their guilt by accusing the honorable elijah muhammad of being anti semitic simply because he teaches our people to go into business for ourselves and trying to take over the economic leadership in our own community. the black people in this country have been the victims of violence at the hands of the white man for 400 years, and following the ignorant negro preachers, we have thought that it was god like to turn the other cheek to the brute that was brutalizing us. 100 years ago they use to put on a white sheet and use a bloodhound against negroes. today they've taken off sheets and put on police uniforms, they've traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs. and just as uncle tom back during slavery used to keep the negroes from resisting the bloodhounds or resisting the ku klux klan by telling them to love their enemy or pray for those who use them as spitefully today. the honorable elijah muhammad is showing black people that just as the white man and every other person on this earth has god given rights, natural rights, civil rights, and any other kind of rights that you can think of when it comes to defending himself.}
