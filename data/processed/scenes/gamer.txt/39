<L>__{interior prison night}
<A>__{a prisoner sings metallica off key, but balls to the walls:}
<C>__{prisoner}
<D>__{master! master! master of puppets i'm pulling your strings twisting your mind and smashing your dreams...}
<A>__{kable is alone in his cell. at the base of the single door is a sliding compartment to push food through it opens. but instead of a tray, someone pushes through a wrinkled photograph. kable picks it up and looks a woman, just a blur of golden hair, laughing, and a little girl... the same one in kable's vision.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{you want to get back to them.}
<A>__{kable is stunned, silent. he sits on the ground, shoulder leaning against the heavy door, staring at the girl in the picture.}
<D>__{woman (o.s.) (cont'd) it's all you think about. it's the only thing that keeps you alive.}
<A>__{her words are like hammer blows to his guts; he wants to weep but he's too strong, too internalized. he steels himself.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{who's talking?}
<A>__{she pushes through a white notecard and pen.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{sign it.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{kable doesn't take it.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{sign it... please, tillman. my son david is your biggest fan. he prays for you.}
<A>__{this takes kable by surprise; he reluctantly takes the pen and card. he writes something on it and sticks it back through the slider. pffhht. the woman stabs kable's hand with a lancet she draws out a little blood. kable yanks his hand back out.}
<D>__{woman (o.s.) (cont'd) need to prove it's authentic. makes it worth more.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{why would anyone want my name?}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{you don't even know what's going on out there, do you?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{damn...}
<A>__{at the far end of the solitary block a buzzer sounds then the slide and slam of heavy steel.}
<D>__{woman (o.s.) (cont'd) gotta go.}
<A>__{kable jumps up and pulls himself against the door a lifeline is slipping away...}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{wait.}
<P>__{(he holds the wrinkled photo to the window)}
<D>__{how did you get this picture? have you seen them?}
<A>__{he peers through the little window at the top of the door, but she's gone... instead, a group of prisoners are being led down the corridor to their new cells. we recognize grim, battered faces from the yard these are the men that stood by as the guard was being beaten down. distinctive prisoner hands cuffed behind his back, makes eye contact with kable as he walks by.}
