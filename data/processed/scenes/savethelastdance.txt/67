<L>__{interior roy's apartment kitchen next morning}
<A>__{roy's making breakfast when sara straggles in. she peers at the stove. scrambled eggs and bacon. toast too! a first for him.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{figured i'd put a little marrow in your bones. siddown, siddown.}
<P>__{(she slumps in chair)}
<D>__{you gettin' along at school? makin' friends...?}
<P>__{(as she nods robotically)}
<D>__{... see any of 'em last night?}
<A>__{he slides a plate in front of her. stands there holding his.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i came home on my break.}

<A>__{the succinct sneer in her voice gets to roy. he snaps at her.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{... oh? jesus! you're hard! look. you're seventeen. if you wanna go out, go out. but don't lie to me. on top of everything else, don't make me worry like that about you.}

<P>__{(after long moment)}
<D>__{i didn't mean to yell.}
<P>__{(sits down; trying like hell)}
<D>__{so how are the eggs? they good?}
<A>__{sara takes a small, tasteless sample, nods. they eat in silence. then sara looks over at him with genuine if detached remorse.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{you're right. i should've said something. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{roy exhales. finally, a chink in the brick wall.}
