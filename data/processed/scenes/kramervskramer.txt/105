<L>__{exterior central park day}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{the saturday father and his daughter, clearly with nothing to say to one another, stand eating ices from a nearby vendor. the camera pans away from them across to billy, ted and phyllis. she is dressed in a very nice suit, silk blouse, high heeled shoes and looks distinctly out of place in central park on a saturday afternoon. at the moment, ted is trying to teach billy how to bat.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{now look, you hold it like this...}
<P>__{(he places billy's}
<D>__{hands on the bat}
<P>__{just so)}
<D>__{...and you swing like this...}
<P>__{(taking him through the motions)}
<B>__{on phyllis}
<A>__{watching. she can't believe what she's seeing. finally, she can't stand it any longer.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{no, no, no, kramer. that's not how you do it. look...}
<A>__{she crosses to billy, gently takes the bat from him and demonstrates.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{...you hold it like this...}
<P>__{(showing him her grip)}
<D>__{farther down the bat. and you swing like this...}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{throw me one.}
<B>__{on ted}
<A>__{as he gives billy a look that says, we have to humor her. he throws a ball.}
<B>__{on phyllis}
<A>__{as she swings, connects and slams a ball in a long, looping fly that goes at least two hundred feet.}
<B>__{on ted}
<A>__{watching the ball disappear in the distance, he turns back to phyllis, open mouthed.}
<B>__{close on phyllis}
<A>__{embarrassed, she grins, shrugs and hands the bat back to billy.}
