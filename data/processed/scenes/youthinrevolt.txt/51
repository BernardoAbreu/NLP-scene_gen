<L>__{interior lincoln (moving) day}
<A>__{sheeni's in back with nick, but doesn't seem to mind the wind tunnel. she has a scarf tied around her chestnut locks. nick looks down as she casually rests a hand on the inside of his thigh. as they round a curve at 60, she yanks nick's sunglasses off and tosses them over her shoulder into the lake.}
<L>__{exterior geezer's manor day}
<A>__{estelle, jerry, nick, and a toothless old geezer whose gut rivals jerry's, all stare at a rusty rv that looks like it might not make the trip back. in the background, sheeni pets a goat in the dusty yard.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{what's your cash price?}
<C>__{geezer}
<D>__{i said in the ad. thousand dollars firm.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{thousand, huh? that must be with a guarantee.}
<C>__{geezer}
<D>__{as is, where she is.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i don't know. those rusty propane tanks are a fire hazard. the roof probably needs work. i couldn't go above eight hundred.}
<A>__{the geezer ponders the bad news. estelle shakes her head and goes inside the rv to inspect.}
<C>__{estelle }
<D>__{there are mouse droppings in all the closets, jerry.}
<C>__{geezer}
<D>__{i might take nine fifty.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{nine hundred.}
<A>__{sheeni lets out a squeal of delight. they all turn their attention to where she has discovered a box full of squirming}
<B>__{puppies.}
<A>__{she brings one of them over.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{look, nick!}
<A>__{she shows him the ugly little pug. short droopy ears, a tiny, batlike face.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<P>__{(to the geezer)}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{geezer}
<D>__{ten dollars.}
<A>__{sheeni turns to nick pleadingly. nick fishes through his wallet.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{all i have is a subway card with four stickers.}
<C>__{geezer}
<D>__{sold.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no doubt close to the dog's actual value.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{oh, thank you, nickie!}
<A>__{she plants a kiss on his lips and promptly turns her attention to the dog, who licks her face affectionately. nick looks on with appropriate jealousy.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{i'm going to name him albert.}
<P>__{(pronounced al bear)}
<C>__{geezer}
<D>__{that don't sound like any kind of name for a dog.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<P>__{(scowling defensively)}
<D>__{i will have you know i've named him after the deceased french writer, albert camus. author of l'etranger and other works of existential brilliance.}
<A>__{the geezer looks to nick with an expression of "i stand corrected." nick returns with a nod that says "you have no idea."}
