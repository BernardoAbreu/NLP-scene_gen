<C>__{surgeon}
<D>__{well, he's not out of danger, but i think we can safely say he's going to make it. i'd be pretty surprised if he didn't. however, there is evidence of injury to the frontal lobe, and i have reason to fear that this injury may be permanent. the patient may never again function as a normal human being.}

<D>__{brain damage? you mean he's going to be a vegetable?}
<C>__{surgeon}
<D>__{vegetable? vegetable? i wouldn't say that, no. we won't ascertain the extent of the injury for some days. but there is a genuine possibility of severe and lasting behavioral defects. i wouldn't classify it in the vegetable category, however.}
