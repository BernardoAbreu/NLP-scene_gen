<L>__{exterior the island various shots day}
<A>__{the island rumbles and shakes. from fissures and small natural caves, dirt and rock shoot out like spraying water. still the explosion continue. a huge chunk of white cliff falls away into the turbulent sea. birds scream and soar, afraid to land. finally, we settle on a full shot of the island. we can recognize that the small opening high on the slope from which a cloud of smoke and dust is billowing is the end of the mine tunnel. and there below it, quite small from this distance is the dock. and the boat that looks like a greek fishing boat. there can be no mistake even from this far away the boat is chugging out to sea.}
