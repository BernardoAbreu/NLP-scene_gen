<L>__{ext welles' house. pool day}
<A>__{welles, wrapped in a bathrobe, is pacing quickly around the perimeter of his backyard pool. he is puffing on a cigar and grunting to himself as he scribbles down notes. mank, wearing sunglasses and a battered fedora and looking decidedly hung over, comes from the house to the pool. welles roars up to him:}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{mank! you scoundrel! what took you so long?!}
<C>__{mank}
<P>__{(pained)}
<D>__{orson, please ... it's too bright}
<A>__{welles takes mank's fedora and flings it away.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!}
<C>__{mank}
<P>__{(settling into a deck chair)}
<D>__{okay, boy wonder, what?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{listen ... i've got it! it came to me like a thief in the night! pure inspiration! total magnificence!}
<A>__{mank takes a glass from a tray of orange juice and pours vodka from a flask into his juice as:}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{oh for christ's sake }
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i know who we're going to get i the great american biography! a journey into the soul of the beast.}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{this better be good}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{image a man that has shaped his time. a titanic figure of limitless influence. think about empire. a man with an empire at his feet. a man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. feudal.}
<C>__{mank}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{oh christ...}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his }
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{oh christ}
<A>__{a beat as welles stands in triumph before mank.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mank}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{please don't say this.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{mank }
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{don't whisper it. don't even think it}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{how long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses every single day in the newspapers and on the radio waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! waiting for !}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{orson. stop. just stop}
<A>__{welles quickly sits in a deck chair next to mank as: beat}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from }
<C>__{mank}
<P>__{(laughs coldly) listen to you. you}
<D>__{child! men like him don't bother with things like legality. they don't have to. you know why, boy o? power. power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{howard hughes, he would just kill us. hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{we're doing hearst.}
<A>__{a beat. mank slowly removes his sunglasses and leans forward, dead serious. a beat.}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{you may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. you're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and hollywood that hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. when he flicks you away with one finger. i'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine hell.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{so speaks the court jester.}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{fuck you}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i expected more from you.}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{sorry to disappointerior}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(with building venom)}
<D>__{how does it feel, mank? going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? how does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves ?!}
<A>__{mank leaps to his feet}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{it feels just fine, you pompous fuck }
<A>__{welles blocks mank's way. mank retreats. welles pursues him around the pool as:}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i remember a man who wrote i he was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight }
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{don't do this}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{where did he go? he hasn't had a screen credit in four years }
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{don't do this}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(savagely)}
<D>__{ because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. amusing his keepers. because he is a sycophant! because he has been thrown out of every studio in hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk !}
<A>__{mank spins on him:}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{and you're nothing but a goddamn phony! what is all this "orson welles" bullshit?! this boy genius crap?! what the fuck did you ever create? you're just another goddamn actor!}
<A>__{welles shoves mank violently. mank goes sailing into the pool. mank splashes to the surface and stands for a shocked moment and then wades to the edge of the pool. miraculously, and like the true drinker he is, mank is still holding his glass of juice and vodka, now supplemented with pool water. welles stands above him, blocking his exit from the pool. from this low angle welles suddenly looks startlingly kane like. a pause}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{let me out.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{listen to me }
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{fuck you }
<C>__{welles}
<A>__{i am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!}
<C>__{mank}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{i don't have it anymore?!}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{when i was a kid i wanted to scorch the world too i had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. but all that's finished for me }
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{it doesn't have to be}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{and yeah, sure, hearst's a great subject. been keeping notes on him for years for my ...}
<P>__{(he laughs bitterly)}
<D>__{great american novel. but i can't do it anymore. no studio's gonna hire me and i }
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i will hire you right now }
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{i can't do it. okay?! i drink too much i drink all the fucking time and i don't have it anymore. all that is over for me }
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(roars)}
<D>__{not unless i. tell you it is}
<A>__{a tense pause welles kneels by the edge of the pool, effortlessly switching gears.}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(deeply)}
<D>__{look, mank, this is our only chance}
<A>__{i know this is the story. and now is the time. and i cannot do it without you. everything in my life all the promise and potential and dreams have led to this moment right now. to you and me. right here. a pause. welles gazes at mank, imploring}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{he'll destroy us.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{then let him. what have we got to lose, you and i?}
<A>__{a long beat welles leans close to him.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{take my hand, mank. and we'll dance one last time. we'll dance to the music of the angels. we'll make history. we'll scorch the earth. we will ... astonish them all.}
<A>__{silence as welles offers his hand to mank. mank takes a sip from his glass of juice, vodka and pool water.}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{thank god you don't write dialogue}
