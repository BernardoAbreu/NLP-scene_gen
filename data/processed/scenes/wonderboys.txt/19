<L>__{interior hallway}
<A>__{a low rumble freezes grady as he enters the hail. a few feet away, poe lies belly to the ground, his blind blue eyes trained, more or less, in grady's direction.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{okay. easy now. eee zy. . . .}
<A>__{grady starts to take a step, when.... poe shoots forward and sinks himself deep into grady's ankle.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{jesus!}
<A>__{grady hops gracelessly, momentarily lifting poe off the ground as he swings his leg up. poe, countering, rolls his head in a snapping motion and drops grady in a clumsy heap.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{get off of me, you son of a bitch!}
<A>__{poe regains his feet, but doesn't let go, whipping his head back and forth, back and forth, over and over, growling low, dark, and hideously from the back of his throat, until there is a sharp... crack! crack! poe yelps, goes perfectly still, then topples heavily onto grady's legs. grady turns. james leer stands in the doorway, posed with the little pearl handled pistol like steve mcqueen. grady looks at james. then poe. then back to james.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{shit, james. you shoe dr. gaskell's dog.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i had to. didn't i?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{couldn't you've just pulled him off me?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{no! he was crazy. i didn't he looked 1 thought }
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{okay, okay. take it easy. don't freak out on me.}
<A>__{grady roils down his sock. apparently, poe went through life with a slight overbite.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{do you have a mirror? it's the best way to see if someone's breathing.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{he's dead, james. believe me, i know a dead dog when i see one.}
<A>__{james looks miserably at poe.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{what are we going to do?}
<A>__{grady rises awkwardly, holds out his hand.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{first you're going to give me that little cap gun of yours.}
