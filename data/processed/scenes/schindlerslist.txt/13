<A>__{max strolls along the sidewalk, browsing in store windows. people inside and out nod hello, but they despise him, they fear him. just as he's passing a synagogue, some men in long overcoats cross the street. einsatzgruppen, they are an elite and wild bunch, one of six special chivalrous duty squads assigned to cracow.}
<L>__{interior starar boznica synagogue same time day}
<A>__{the sabbath prayers of a congregation of orthodox jews are interrupted by a commotion at the rear of the ancient temple. several non orthodox jews from the street, including max redlicht, are being herded inside by the einsatz boys. they're made to stand before the ark in two lines: orthodox and non. one of the einsatzgruppen squad removes the parchment torah scroll while another calmly addresses the assembly:}

<D>__{i want you to spit on it. i want you to walk past, spit on it, and stand over there.}
<A>__{no one does anything for a moment. the liberals from the street seem to say with their eyes, come on, we're all too sophisticated for this; the others, with the beards and sidelocks, silently check with their rabbi. one by one then they file past and spit on the scroll. the last two, the rabbi and max redlicht hesitate. they exchange a glance. the rabbi finally does it; the gangster doesn't. after a long tense silence.}
<C>__{max redlicht}
<D>__{i haven't been to temple must be fifty years.}
<P>__{(to the rabbi)}
<D>__{nor have i been invited.}
<A>__{the einsatz nco glances from max to the rabbi and smiles to himself. this is unexpected, this rift.}

<P>__{(to the rabbi)}
<D>__{you don't approve of the way i make my living? i'm a bad man, i do bad things?}
<A>__{max admits it with a shrug.}
<C>__{max redlicht}
<D>__{i've done some things... but i won't do this.}
<A>__{silence. the einsatz nco glances away to the others, amused.}
<C>__{einsatz nco}
<D>__{what does this mean? of all of you, there's only one who has the guts to say no? one? and he doesn't even believe?}
<P>__{(no one, of course answer him)}
<D>__{i come in here, i ask you to do something no one should ever ask. and you do it?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what won't you do?}
<A>__{nobody answers. he turns to max.}
<C>__{einsatz nco}
<D>__{you, sir, i respect.}
<A>__{he pulls out a revolver and shoots the old gangster in the head. he's dead before he hits the floor.}
<C>__{einsatz nco}
<D>__{the rest of you... ...are beneath his contempt.}
<A>__{he turns and walks away. the other einsatz boys pull rifles and revolvers from their coats and open fire.}
