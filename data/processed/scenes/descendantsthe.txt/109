<L>__{interior hospice room the next day}
<A>__{matt and the kids sit in a sort of vigil. alex and scottie read books, matt has brought some paperwork, sid reads a magazine. elizabeth emits a sigh. all look up a moment before looking back down. matt's phone vibrates. checking the caller id hugh king he opts not to answer. the door opens, and elizabeth's brother barry thorson accompanies his parents scott and alice into the room.}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{here we are.}
<P>__{(to scottie)}
<D>__{hi, bingo. alex.}
<A>__{cheerful alice doesn't really get what's going on. an emotional barry hugs matt and the girls.}
<C>__{scott thorson }
<P>__{(eyeing sid)}
<D>__{there you are again.}
<A>__{matt and alex maneuver seats for the thorsons to sit near the bed. barry gets his mother situated, then takes a seat himself. remaining on his feet, old scott surveys his daughter from a distance.}
<C>__{scott thorson }
<D>__{so what did you decide?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{there's not much left to decide. we're just sort of playing it by ear and making sure she's comfortable.}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{i mean what did you decide about the buyer? who's your buyer?}
<A>__{even sid and his daughters perk up at this question. matt is taken aback.}
<C>__{scott thorson }
<D>__{how much are you getting?}
<C>__{barry thorson}
<D>__{dad, i'm sure you'll be able to read about it in the paper.}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{i don't need to read about it. i can hear about it right now.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{scott, let's not talk about that here. it's not the time for that.}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{all the same to you, i guess. a million here, a million there. just ironic, that's all elizabeth coming into this misfortune just as you're coming into a fortune. she gave you everything, matt. a good, happy home, two beautiful daughters.}
<A>__{matt looks to barry for help, but barry's silence and sheepish look imply he buys into his father's propaganda.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{scott, what's your point?}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{she wanted her own boat. she should have had her own boat, one she would have been familiar with.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{she wasn't even driving! her boat, someone else's boat it wouldn't have made any difference. you're not going to blame me for this.}
<C>__{scott thorson}
<D>__{sure, sure, quibble about the details. she was a faithful, devoted wife. she deserved more.}
<A>__{why fight it?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you're right. she deserved more.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{for christ's sake, take it easy on the man.}
<A>__{scott turns to sid like he's about to pop him again.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{my father has been doing a really amazing job under the circumstances.}
<A>__{his point made, scott looks at matt and the girls and shuffles to elizabeth's bedside, puts his hands on alice's shoulder.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{are we ready to go?}
<C>__{barry thorson}
<D>__{no, mom. not yet.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(gesturing toward the door)}
<D>__{girls, sid.}
<A>__{matt, sid and the girls quietly go into }
