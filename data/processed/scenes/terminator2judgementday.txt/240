<A>__{a100 exterior desert compound day the desert northwest of calexico. burning under the sun like a hallucination. heat shimmers the image, mirage like. terminator turns the pickup off the paved road and barrels along a roadbed a sand and gravel, trailing a huge plume of dust. a sign at the turnoff says: charon mesa 2 mi calexico 15 mi a101 ahead is a pathetic oasis of humanity in the vast wasteland, a couple of aging house trailers, surrounded by assorted junk vehicles and desert style trash. there is a dirt airstrip behind the trailers, and a stripped huey helicopter sitting on block nearby. the truck rolls to a stop in a cloud of dust. the place looks deserted. the door to the nearest trailer bangs in the wind.}

<P>__{(to terminator and john)}
<D>__{stay in the truck.}
<A>__{a102 angle from inside another trailer, nearby. a dark figure in the f.g. has an ak 47 trained on the pickup as sarah gets out. on sarah peering through the backlit dust. the sound of wind. she approaches the trailer.}

<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{enrique? you here?}
<A>__{she hears kachank! behind her and spins, whipping out her .45 in one motion. enrique salceda stands behind a rusting jeep, a 12 gauge pump trained on her. he is mid forties, a tough guatemalan with a weathered face and heavy mustache. he wears cowboy boots and a flak vest, no shirt.}
<C>__{salceda}
<D>__{you pretty jumpy, connor.}
<A>__{his fierce face breaks into a broad grin. the shotgun drops to his side as he walks toward her. when he reaches her he hugs her, then steps back.}
<C>__{salceda}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{good to see you, connor. i knew you'd make it back here sooner or later.}
<A>__{he grins at john as he steps from the truck, and then clocks terminator getting out.}
<C>__{salceda}
<D>__{oye, big john! que pasa? who's your very large friend?}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(perfect spanish)}
<D>__{he's cool, enrique. he's... uh... this is my uncle bob.}
<P>__{(to terminator, in english)}
<D>__{uncle bob, this is enrique.}
<A>__{terminator smiles. sort of. salceda squints at him,}
<C>__{salceda}
<D>__{hmmm. uncle bob, huh? okay.}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{yolanda. get out here, we got company. and bring some fucking tequila!}
<A>__{a thin guatemalan kid, franco, eighteen or so, comes out of the trailer with the ak 47, followed by salceda's wife, yolanda. she has three younger children with her, from a five year old girl, juanita, to a year and half old boy. she waves at john. they exchange greetings in spanish. they seem like nice people. terminator looks down at john, next to him. he says quietly...}

<P>__{(to sarah)}
<D>__{so, sarahlita, you getting famous, you know that? all over the goddamn tv.}
<A>__{salceda rips the cap off the tequila bottle. the two year old toddles to terminator and grabs his pants, sliming them with drool. terminator looks down at the tiny kid, fascinated. what is it? he picks up the child with one huge hand. looks at it. turns it different ways. studying it. then sets it down. the kid waddles off, a little dizzy.}
<C>__{salceda}
<D>__{honey, take pacolito. thanks, baby.}
<A>__{she hands him the tequila and takes the child. salceda takes a long pull from the cuervo bottle.}
<C>__{salceda}
<P>__{(to terminator)}
<D>__{drink?}
<A>__{terminator gestures "no" at the proffered bottle, but sarah grabs it and takes a long pull. she lowers it without expression. her eyes don't even water.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i just came for my stuff. and i need clothes, food, and one of your trucks.}
<C>__{salceda}
<P>__{(grinning)}

<C>__{sarah}
