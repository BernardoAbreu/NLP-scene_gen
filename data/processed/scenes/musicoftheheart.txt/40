<L>__{interior music room day}
<A>__{guadalupe sits on a chair in the empty room, struggling to set up her violin. roberta enters, surprised to see her.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{guadalupe? what are you doing here?}
<C>__{guadalupe}
<D>__{i can't get the stop sign.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{honey, your teacher's probably looking for you.}
<A>__{guadalupe sighs, then hands roberta the violin.}
<C>__{guadalupe}
<D>__{i can't come anymore. it's too hard.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{the violin is hard for everyone.}
<C>__{guadalupe}
<D>__{but everyone else is better than me. i will always be slow.}
<A>__{roberta looks at her sadly and puts the violin in its case.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{did you ever hear of itzhak perlman?}
<C>__{guadalupe}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{he's one of the greatest violinists in the world, and he has problems with his legs too. he walks with two canes but he still makes the most beautiful music.}
<C>__{guadalupe}
<D>__{and he sits down when he plays?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{he has to.}
<A>__{guadalupe takes this in.}
<C>__{guadalupe}
<D>__{he was your student?}
<A>__{roberta laughs.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{no. but if he was, i'd tell him the same thing i'm telling you. you shouldn't quit something just because it's hard.}
<C>__{guadalupe}
<D>__{but i can't stand strong.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{standing strong doesn't only mean using your legs. you can stand strong on the inside too.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{know what i mean?}
<A>__{guadalupe nods. roberta holds out the violin case. guadalupe lunges forward and hugs her around the waist. roberta awkwardly accepts the hug, startled and touched by it, and strokes the girl's hair. guadalupe lets go, takes the violin and exits. hold on roberta as she absorbs what just happened. janet pokes her head into the room.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{you wanted to speak to me?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{oh. umm that's o.k. it's taken care of.}
<A>__{janet looks at her curiously, then exits.}
