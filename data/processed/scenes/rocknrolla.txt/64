<T>__{we cut back to ten years ago:}
<A>__{. cut to a shot of a 12 year old boy with a cut under his eye singing "bank robber" by the clash in to the mirror. he's wearing just his boxer shorts and enjoying himself, he's gonna be a rock star. from behind we see his bedroom door open, but the music is to loud for the boy to have heard the entrance. we see lenny, ten years younger entering, we can tell via the body language that he is irritated. he pauses then walks up suddenly slapping the boy very hard across the side of the face. it's enough to knock him out, the boy goes down shot like a bullet out of a barrel. the red hand then slaps the stereo off.}

<D>__{listen to me boy, listen. i never did like you and neither did your real father. you're a reject, a wrong un, a fuckin fairy in the mirror that i inherited from your mother, but she ain't with us no more, so now it's just you and me. in one week you go back to school, the best fuckin school in the country i might add, then you'll be gone for another term.}
