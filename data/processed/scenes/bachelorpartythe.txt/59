<L>__{interior. charlie and helen's apartment}
<A>__{charlie comes in. the dining area is lit, and there is the lamp lit in the living room. as charlie moves to the living room, we can see that helen is seated on the couch, watching television. the gray white light of the television set drifts out into the room. helen is in her pajamas and she has washed for bed; her face is devoid of make up. she is half watching television; the rest of her attention is devoted to cutting her fingernails and other aspects of manicure. she looks up as charlie comes into the living room, smiles.}

<D>__{hiya, have a nice time?}
<A>__{charlie shrugs. he is depressed and can't conceal it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm taking ten bucks. a couple of the guys are waiting outside. i promised them i'd loan them ten bucks.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{he stands by the couch now, without interest, automatically watching the television set.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(looking at the set)}
<D>__{tomorrow's payday. i will get it back tomorrow.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it's in the drawer.}
<A>__{a kind of ennui has engulfed him. he stands, watching the television set out of which is now pouring the end of an animated cartoon commercial. then the familiar tinkling music sets in, the inscription, "the late show" appears on the screen, and the announcer's voice informs us that we are now going back to the late show, starring rex harrison in "strictly dishonorable." the whole thing brings a wince of pain to charlie's face, and he turns and moves wearily through the little foyer into the darkened bedroom. enough light flows in from the other rooms to show charlie going to the drawer in the chest of drawers and taking out a ten dollar bill. he returns the other bills, closes the drawer and just stands there, suddenly so weak and exhausted that he has to steady himself with one hand on the chest of drawers. back in the living room, helen still sits, a slight frown now indicating she is sensitive to the deeply depressed mood her husband is in. she continues with her nails for a moment. then, wondering what is keeping her husband, she stands and goes to the bedroom doorway and looks in.}
