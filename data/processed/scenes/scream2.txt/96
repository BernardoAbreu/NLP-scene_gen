<A>__{sidney races down the deserted street. not a soul in sight. she reaches a corner, moves off the road and passes through a series of trees and shrubs, coming out onto...}
<L>__{exterior sorority row same}
<A>__{the houses have long since gone to sleep. the delta zeta house stares at sidney. lights burn from within. sid goes for it.}

<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{somebodypleaseopenupsomebody!}
<A>__{sid wastes no time, she moves along the wraparound porch, beating at the windows. but nothing. everybody is off partying. suddenly, sid hears something. a whimpering. she turns to find murphy and lois, laying, strewn across the end of the porch. passed out. sid runs to them.}
<C>__{sidney }
<D>__{oh god, help me. we have to call the police.}
<A>__{sid kneels over murphy, shaking her. murphy's eyes open and she giggles. the girl is completely wasted. she has no comprehension skills at all.}
<C>__{sidney }
<D>__{do you have keys? i need to get inside.}
<A>__{sid looks to lois. she's in worse shape.}
<C>__{sidney }
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{sid contemplates, not knowing what to do. she leaves them, moving down off the porch and around to the back of the house. she gets to the back door, tries it. it's locked too. sidney checks out the yard. off to the side, she spots a big tree with a... body, lying next to it in a heap on the ground she moves toward it. as sid approaches she sees clearly that it's mickey. he lay on his side, curled, knees to chest, his arm still chained to the tree.}
<C>__{sidney }
<D>__{mickey? mickey?}
<A>__{a look of dread creeps across her face. he lay there very much dead.}
<C>__{sidney }
<D>__{oh god, no, mickey...}
<A>__{she kneels over his body just as it stirs, lifting up, rising. mickey's face comes into view, coated in dried funk, his eyes wide.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{sid? jesus, where's hallie? i've been here all night.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{listen to me. we've got to get help. the killer's here.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{he's after me.}
<A>__{mickey pulls on his chained arm.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{shit! you've got to cut me down, sid.}
<A>__{sid inspects the chain. it's meant to hold.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i will be right back.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{where you going?}
<A>__{sidney moves to the shed that's attached to the garage. leaning against the side are a row of garden tools. sid settles on a shovel. sid returns to mickey who has risen to his feet. he's pulling and twisting the bike chain that binds him.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{watch out.}
<A>__{sid lifts the shovel up and brings it down directly on the lock. it bends somewhat but stays in tact.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{do it again.}
<A>__{clank! a noise behind them. they both spin around peering into the night.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{don't panic.}
<A>__{sidney, determined, raises the shovel high and brings it down with great force. it cracks the lock, loosening it. mickey pulls on it. it won't quite give.}
<C>__{sidney }
<D>__{watch out.}
<A>__{sid raises the shovel again, unfaltering. she doesn't see the ghost masked figure that slides down from the tree branch behind her. the figure moves quickly and gracefully, coming to a stance directly behind sid. mickey looks up, just in time.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{sidneywatchout!}
<A>__{sid turns just as the killer strikes. but sid is ready. without thought, she swings the shovel at the ghost, catching his mid section, sending him flying. mickey goes ballistic chained to the tree. he pulls, twists, squirms... anything to free himself. the ghost rises, moving on mickey. sidney sees this.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{sidney distracts the ghost. she takes off, the ghost following her. she moves around the tree, sprinting across the yard, running smack into...}
<B>__{the ghost masked killer}
<A>__{but sidney spins around as two ghosts appear on each side of her. she stands thunderstruck as the two killers descend on her. she dives between the two but they counter, keeping her surrounded. sid watches as one of the ghosts withdraws his knife. she turns to the other. his knife is already poised. they close in on her, ready to strike. she looks for an escape. there's not one. bam! suddenly, mickey appears, barreling into one of the ghosts. they go sprawling across the grass.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{run, sid...}
<A>__{sidney makes her break, she runs passed them, towards the front of the yard. mickey leaps to his feat. the killer right behind him. he now finds himself in sid's predicament. he doesn't know where to run. the two killer's close in on him. sidney gets to the corner of the house. she stops... she doesn't want to leave mickey. she turns back around just in time to see... mickey sandwiched in between the two ghosts. they're knives strike at the same time. one through the stomach, the other through the back. they withdraw their knives. mickey's body suspends, momentarily hanging in the air. then collapses to a heap on the ground. both ghosts turn to sid at the same time. she takes off running, along the side of the house, through a row of shrub that take her to...}
