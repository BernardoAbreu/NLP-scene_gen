<L>__{exterior a street near brick lane evening}
<D>__{it's 5.30pm in late december and rain is pouring. the scant christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain. a young turk (ekrem) runs through the rain with a turkish newspaper held over his head. he ducks into a traditional barber's shop called ozim's.}
<L>__{interior ozim's barber shop evening}
<P>__{the shutters are drawn. ozim (a plump middle aged turk)}
<D>__{is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (soyka). soyka is a chechen, well groomed, wearing a sharp suit beneath the barber's gown. during the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle and star shaped tattoos on soyka's arms and hands. ozim and soyka are chatting as ekrem enters. soyka speaks with a russian accent.}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{guvenilmez... daginik... bloody kids, you know... he says `but amca it's christmas?... christmas! we're islam!}
<C>__{soyka}
<D>__{oi, how much are you taking off?}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{christmas! so i said to him... alisverise cimac. the kid's sixteen... ozim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and ozim finally acknowledges ekrem, who is shivering and wet near to the door. ekrem turns the `open' sign to `closed'.}
<C>__{ozim }
<D>__{they don't want to work do they. shicma....}
<C>__{ekrem}
<P>__{(hesitantly interrupting)}
<D>__{uncle ozim....... we see for the first time that ekrem is shaking with fear as well as cold.}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{this is him. the kid i'm talking about. ekrem approaches, stiffened by terror. soyka nods at ekrem in the mirror.}
<C>__{soyka}
<D>__{he looks ok to me... how you doin' ekrem? soyka offers ekrem a hand to shake and ekrem stares at it as if it were enchanted...}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{he looks ok, yeah, but he won't do one lousy thing for me. here, look... ekrem, take this... ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair tonic bottles and hands it to ekrem, who now looks mortally terrified.}
<C>__{ekrem}
<D>__{ozim... memnum etmek.}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{we had a deal now he's backing out.}
<C>__{soyka}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{hey ozim, leave the kid alone. it's obviously a psychological thing...}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{take it ekrem.}
<C>__{soyka}
<D>__{ozim, it's ok. i don't want a shave.}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{this is the kid who walks around like al capone. take the fucking ustura and finish this rushca.}
<C>__{soyka}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{what? soyka rises up from the seat, casting off his barber's gown. ozim yells `kabuka! and ekrem snarls, flicks open the razor and drags it across soyka's throat. soyka's scream bubbles in the blood.}
