<A>__{ slowly walks into the kitchen. she reaches out and turns the faucet handle. tightens it. the dripping stops. relieved, susan turns away drip. drip. it begins again. louder, more intense. scared, susan turns back to the sink. water is now gushing out from the faucet, filling up a bowl in the sink. she slowly reaches out a hand and turns the faucet, as tightly as she can manage tighter... tighter... straining with the effort.. until the water stops. only then does she let go just then, a child's pale hand quietly rises to the surface from water in the bowl, and starts violently splashing the surface. susan screams and runs back to her bedroom }
