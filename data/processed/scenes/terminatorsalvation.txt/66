<A>__{morrison is bearded, long haired, bleary eyed, a middle aged man in charge here. he sits up in bed, also beside a couple of women. this place has become an underground crash pad, communal living for about a dozen people morrison and barnes the only men, four or five women and quite a few children of varying age. barnes grunts, yanks the blanket off his bedmates, who cry out in protest. he wraps it around himself, carries the candle as he steps around other sleeping figures, makes his way toward a metal staircase winding downward. moments later, we hear a gas engine start up lights flicker on. the place is pretty grimy and run down, but it was once a military environment. there's a bank of tv monitors against one wall, which come to life. a couple of the women move toward the adjacent nursery area to tend to the babies one of them, lisa, moves to the tv monitors. she squints at one.}
