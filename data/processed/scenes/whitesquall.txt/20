<L>__{exterior deck dawn}
<A>__{the sun has barely cracked the horizon as the crew staggers onto the deck, shirtless and shivering.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{line up! single file. single file.}
<A>__{the crew lines up. john is the last one through the hatch and he lets us know his boundaries are being pressed.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{everybody swims.}
<A>__{the boys are aghast.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{don't think people, just go! go, go, go, go, go!!! swim you win, stay you pay!!}
<A>__{rick is the first one through the gunnel door, followed by tod and charlie. they howl and scream as they hit the water. the rest follow like lemmings. but john stands defiantly with his arms folded.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{now what's the problem, goodall? everybody swims.}
<A>__{the crew are piling back on deck. george stands in the open galley door. the smell of fresh bacon is intoxicating.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{you will if you wanna eat. right george?}
<A>__{george nods, wielding a butchers knife. the crew stand shivering, waiting on john.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{you gonna swim for your breakfast?}
<A>__{bill gives john a long look then strips to his shorts, swings into the rigging and climbs up to the first yard arm. he looks down at the water some twenty five feet below. it's a long way. robin turns away. lawford booms in a voice that echoes across the harbor.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{"down, down beneath the deep, that oft in triumph bore him, he sleeps a sound and peaceful sleep, with the salt waves dashing over him." lord byron gentlemen.}
<A>__{with that bill leaps and hits the water with a huge kersplash! he swims to the boarding ladder, pulls himself up and gets in john's face.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{everybody swims. now, i've been in twice. so i guess i will be eating your breakfast too.}
<A>__{john considers him, then strips off his shirt. but instead of walking over to the gunnel door, he jumps into the ratlines, climbs to the foretop and looks down. he manages a thin smile then climbs to the second set of ratlines past the third yard and continues to the top yard arm the topgallant. it's a pissing contest and everybody knows it.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i got five bucks says he doesn't.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i got five that says he doesn't live.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{i will take a dollar of that.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{this is crazy!}
<A>__{robin refuses to watch. the others share a look. john makes his way along the foot ropes and stands at the end of the yard. he tosses a look towards bill but with no way to back down, he launches into the air. everyone gasps as he thunders through the air in a broad swan dive. falling, falling, falling...}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i can't watch this.}
<A>__{john hits the water like a bullet. the crew run to the side waiting for him to come up. nothing. finally, he breaks the surface. easy. he climbs up waiting, somehow, to claim victory. suddenly, they all feel it. a presence. he has appeared silently on top of the chart house, like a phantom gazing down at them, back lit by the sun the boys must squint to see him. richard sheldrake, (skipper), ageless and windswept, casually reaches up to a block and tackle with one arm and glides to the deck. he is powerfully built and bronzed from the sea and sun. he carriers the burden of command like a cross. soft spoken and remote, he is a man to be reckoned with. the crew know they are in the presence of someone larger than life.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{skipper on deck!}
<A>__{the crew line up clumsily. skipper has a gaze that blazes right through them. he looks out to sea. searching, ominous. he waits until the silence is filled with everyone's attention.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{you know what's out there? wind and wave and rain. endless glassy pools that'll hold a sailing ship for weeks and then spit her out into the eye of the kind of hurricane. a blow that could knock the bridge off a battleship. reefs and rocks and sandbars that'll tear the belly from her and enough fog and night to hide it all.}
<A>__{he spits into the water. the crew sheepishly throw glances to the horizon.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{so look out there... and explain to me why any man in possession of any sense at all, would take on the sea with sail?}
<A>__{skipper turns his gaze back to the boys. there is a fire in his eyes. nobody dare answers.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{because there's something else out there. it beckons in the wind and sings in the shrouds. voices. whispering...}
<A>__{his ear to the wind.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{they're voices of men. calling. men you don't even know. men you can't even imagine. it's a seed, a wish, that part of you and i that aches to be alive, that was banished by everything we've ever been taught or told. it's a part of us that can only be found on mountain tops and deserts, in the deepest caverns, smoking battle fields and... across oceans.}
<A>__{he turns back to the sea, dark.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{out there, is where it all waits.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{he was everything i had expected, part ahab part queeg and even bligh. he spoke in whispers and answered all queries with efficiency and directness. he had gone to sea for the first time at fifteen, the same age as bill butler. and as he looked upon us that first day it must have been as though he were staring into a mirror.}
<A>__{skipper manages a sobering look and climbs on top of the chart house. he pats a small brass sign that is welded to the main mast and reads the inscription.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"where we go one, we go all."}
<A>__{with that, he disappears below. nobody moves. this is exactly the kind of man you want around when the shit hits the fan.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{this is gonna be a long eight months.}
