<L>__{interior dark parking garage}
<A>__{... where several thugs in overcoats emerge from the shadows and start beating him with lead pipes. one of the men pulls out a gun and shoots the rhino several times. the shots reverberate through the empty garage.}

<L>__{interior television studio day}
<A>__{it's the taping of another children's show "rainbow randolph and the krinkle kids." randolph smiley, a clean cut man with a happy face and yellow bow tie, dances through rainbowland with the "krinkle kids" (little people in top hats). he sings one of his signature songs: "friends come in all sizes." one of the main krinkle kids angelo pike dances behind him.}

<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{'friends come in all sizes that's a fact! it's true! all colors of the rainbow from mauve to blue...}
<C>__{randolph }
<D>__{their names may not be different and their shoes may not match one might say 'grasp' while the other says 'snatch' some like to toss while others like to caaaaatch... beeee caaaause... friends come in all sizes take it from me! golly gee! size never matters when you want some friendly patter from a pal who is true and can lift you when you're blue you can count on him and he can count on yoooouuuu! it's true... that...}

<A>__{montage rainbow randolph merchandise "sugar rainbows cereal," plastic toys lined up on store shelves, kids playing with randolph dolls, kids eating "rainbow potato chips" and "rainbow candies." a "rainbow burster," a kind of gun that shoots plastic rainbows. marquees announcing upcoming live appearances, etc. we get the picture. rainbow randolph is the king of the kid shows.}
<L>__{interior dimly lit bar night}
<A>__{a suburban looking husband and wife enter. they find rainbow randolph sitting alone, drinking a scotch. hair slicked back, sans bow tie, the friendly face no longer looks so friendly. he nods for them to sit down. after a nervous beat, the husband puts a briefcase on the table and slides it to randolph. randolph takes a gulp of his scotch. he unsnaps the briefcase and opens it. five grand stares him in the face.}
<C>__{husband}
<D>__{so... uh... you'll make sure my boy dances up front, right? where he'll get the most camera time?}
<A>__{randolph slams the briefcase shut, startling the couple.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{you want your kid on the show?}
<C>__{husband}
<D>__{of... of course.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{yes, very much.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{then don't tell me how to run my fucking business.}
<C>__{husband}
<D>__{no, no, we were just }
<A>__{randolph rises. he takes a final gulp of his scotch and picks up the briefcase.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{i will call you if a spot opens up.}
<A>__{he starts to walk off. suddenly, the husband and wife jump up from the table holding guns.}
<C>__{husband}
<D>__{freeze, you cocksucker!}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{drop the briefcase!}
<A>__{federal agents storm into the bar and surround randolph.}
<L>__{exterior times square dawn}
<A>__{bundles of the morning editions are tossed onto the curb from passing trucks. the various headlines blare: "rainbow randolph busted accepting bribe" "fcc probes kid show biz" "corruption in krinkleland"}
<L>__{interior television studio day}
<A>__{the rainbow randolph krinkle kid set is being dismantled. backdrops are rolled up and the giant rainbow centerpiece is wheeled off. workers with push brooms sweep up tons of glittery "magic rainbow dust."}

<C>__{stokes}
<P>__{(addressing the brass)}
<D>__{gentlemen, let me be the first to say, in all sobriety, that i'm as shocked and outraged as all of }
<A>__{the network ceo, a hog of a man, cuts him off.}
<C>__{ceo}
<D>__{save it for the papers, stokes. we've got nervous sponsors and an angry public a combination uglier than two monkeys fucking. what are you doing about it?}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{well, sir, i'm currently in the process of compiling a list of viable replacements and it's my hope...}
<C>__{ceo}
<D>__{clean replacements? with background checks? i assure you, mr. stokes, this network cannot survive another rainbow randolph. the goddamn p.r. department looks like the jim jones camp.}
<A>__{another executive chimes in.}
<D>__{executive #1 remember, stokes, this was your dog that crapped on our rug. executive #2 we trusted you, frank. and now we're in a tight spot. we have to post our quarterly earnings next month, for christ's sake.}
<C>__{ceo}
<D>__{whoever takes that slot has to be a straight arrow. clean as a whistle. executive #3 right. someone who'll take the heat off. one of those sweater types. any chance of luring fred rogers away from p.b.s.? executive #4 yeah, if we back up the brinks truck. executive #1 no way. the idea now is to stop the hemorrhaging. executive #2 you better fix this, stokes. get us a white bread replacement, fast. bland, milk toast. not a speck of controversy.}
<A>__{a giant hand slams on the table. all heads snap. the ceo drags his fingers along the shiny mahogany. deafening sound.}
<C>__{ceo}
<P>__{(calm and measured)}
<D>__{squeaky fucking clean.}
<L>__{interior stokes' office day}
<A>__{stokes sits behind his mahogany desk, sipping a glass of wine as he goes over potential randolph replacements with nora bishop, his pretty protege.}

<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{skippy black and the tippy trolls?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{black was deported, and the trolls... well, who gives a shit.}
<A>__{nora kicks the table in frustration.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{this is impossible. if i ever see that rainbow randolph again i will strangle him. choke the life out of him. squeeze his scrawny neck until his eyes pop out of his skull and bounce off the walls...}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{before indulging such cheery fantasies, let's just concentrate on saving my job. shall we?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{sorry, frank.}
<A>__{stokes flips through a thick stack of files. he suddenly stops at one.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{what's going on with sheldon mopes these days.}
<A>__{nora laughs.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{oh my god. have we sunk to that level already? smoochy the rhino? what a sap.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{sap's just the pill we need right now. mopes is a straight arrow. always has been.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{the guy can't get arrested, frank. he can't even break into the birthday party circuit. last i heard he was working hospitals and nursing homes. he's a joke.}
<A>__{stokes stands up and walks around the room.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{the truth of the matter is, a successful children's show has always depended on two simple elements: a fuzzy costume and a lot of hype. strip away the foam rubber and the network money and they're all jokes. marginal talents.. cabaret acts... off broadway runoff...}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i probably have ten acts in my development file acts i've been cultivating that are more deserving than sheldon mopes.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{and each one a moral question mark. something i can't risk at the moment.}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{we can do better than this guy, frank. he brings nothing to the table.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{except ethics. with mopes, there's never been a whiff of controversy. the man's an ethical, harmless, cornball. in short, a glass of milk on two legs.}
<A>__{stokes stops pacing.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{don't ask me to do it. you know i will do anything for you, but please... not this...}
<A>__{stokes gazes out the window at the city.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{go find smoochy.}
<L>__{exterior coney island early evening}
<A>__{the lighted ferris wheel spins center frame. we crane down and eventually land on a side street with the amusement park looming in the b.g. we're in front of a small building. the half lit neon sign reads: coney island methadone center. we drift through the double doors through the reception area where random junkies loiter and fill out paperwork. we continue down a narrow hallway as the faint sound of someone singing and playing the guitar increases. we finally burst through another set of doors marked "treatment room." the singing now fills our ears as we push in on the "performer" a big, puffy, orange rhinoceros. smoochy. or to be more specific, sheldon mopes. smoochy sits on a stool with his guitar and sings to the patients as they stand in line before a sliding glass window, where a nurse hands each person a little cup of methadone which they immediately drink. the smoochy costume is a mass of misshapen orange foam rubber that exposes sheldon's painted face in the front. a multi colored horn protrudes from his forehead.}
<C>__{smoochy }
<P>__{(singing to the tune}
<D>__{of 'she'll be comin'}
<P>__{round the mountain')}
<D>__{'we'll get that monkey off your back, yes we will, yes we will we'll get that monkey off your back, yes we will...' 'we'll get that monkey off your back and get your life right back on track if you'll just give up the smack yes you will, yes you will!!'}
<A>__{the song ends. a few baffled junkies applaud.}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{thanks, fellas. i'm rooting for you!}
<A>__{we pan away from sheldon to the exit. standing there in her coat, looking mortified, is nora.}
<L>__{interior reception area short while later}
<A>__{nora sits in the reception area. sheldon emerges in his street clothes. he carries smoochy's body on a hanger over his shoulder and carries a large shopping bag which holds smoochy's head.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{mr. mopes?}
<A>__{sheldon stops.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i, uh, saw your performance tonight. very...}
<P>__{(searching)}
<D>__{... spirited.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{really? thanks. i would've done a longer set if that guy hadn't pulled a knife on the security guard. once the pepper spray starts flyin', that's it for the encores.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{yes, that did put a damper on the evening, didn't it?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{are you a new patient? on the juice, as we say?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{ah, no. but it's sweet of you to assume so.}
<A>__{she hands him her card. he reads it.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{'nora bishop. v.p. of development. kidnet.'}
<P>__{(to nora)}
<D>__{good gravy. you work for kidnet?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{as stated.}
<A>__{sheldon grabs her hand and shakes it.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{well, it's a pleasure to meet you, nora. a real honor. hey, you hungry?}
<L>__{exterior coney island boardwalk nathan's hot dogs short}
<B>__{while later}
<A>__{sheldon and nora stand at the crowded counter at nathan's. sheldon ravenously eats his sloppily garnished, oddly colored hot dog. nora winces as she watches him.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<P>__{(with full mouth)}
<D>__{soy dogs... never thought i'd live to see the day. organic, rich in natural protein, and nobody gets killed. although i do feel bad for the beans. just kidding. sure you don't want one?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{believe it or not, no.}
<A>__{he takes another bite.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{so anyway, like i was saying, people always tell me, 'you gotta network, sheldon... you gotta sell yourself... or you'll be playing the drug clinics and shopping centers the rest of your life.' and you know what i tell 'em?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i haven't the foggiest.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i tell 'em, it's not about the old handshake and back slap game. it's not about adding fuel to the shlock machine. it's about doing good work. having integrity. making people happy and delivering a positive message. foundations are built with concrete, not plaster of paris!}
<A>__{he pulls the stained, misshapen smoochy head from the shopping bag.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{this is concrete! this is integrity!}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{i can see that.}
<A>__{sheldon realizes his voice was getting too loud.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{sorry. as you can imagine, living by your convictions can be a little stressful at times.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{we all have our cross to bear.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{see, i was raised by my grandfather, and grandpop paved driveways for a living...}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{are we going into a story?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{thing is, he didn't really pave them. just covered them with black painterior of course, once the first rain came along, people realized they'd been swindled. i vowed to myself back then that i'd never make a living through deception. never. whadda ya think of them apples?}
<A>__{nora looks glassy eyed. she takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{the reason i'm here today, mr. mopes, as fate would have it, kidnet is currently looking for a performer with... convictions. and integrity. someone like...}
<A>__{she almost chokes on the word.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{... yourself.}
<A>__{sheldon laughs.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{yeah, right. got any more jokes?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i don't think i could top that one.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{hold the phone. you're telling me that kidnet is finally ready to do a show of smoochy quality? of smoochy caliber?}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{yes... i believe we're ready to push ourselves to that level.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i knew this day would come! after all these years i finally meet someone in the business who gets what i do. who gets what i'm all about. you get me, don't you, nora?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i'm afraid so.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{well, miss v.p. of development... let's go make history!}

<A>__{kidnet studio wardrobe room. a team of designers and seamstresses cut, sew and shape endless sheets of orange foam rubber. sheldon stands on a wooden box as he's measured from head to toe. on the wall is a blueprint labeled "smoochy the rhino redesign." a costume designer walks over with the new smoochy head and places it on sheldon. as seamstresses fit him with the new smoochy costume, various signs and billboards float through the frame, trumpeting copy like: "it's almost smoochy time!" "get ready to be smooched, america!" "only two more weeks till smoochy!" kidnet studio c. sets, props, and camera equipment are rolled into the studio. through a series of dissolves we see the smoochyland magic jungle take shape. kidnet studio c later a choreographer maps out a number for smoochy and the "rhinettes." (the rhinettes are the former krinkle kid little people with horns strapped to their foreheads.) nora and stokes watch from the wings with a mixture of uncertainty and disgust.}

<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{really? you know, i used to have dinner engagements. sometimes four, five a night. dinner... drinks... i was the toast of the fucking town.}

<C>__{randolph}
<P>__{(voice rising)}
<D>__{cars, boats, whores and horses, i had 'em all. when i walked into a restaurant, ten guys reached for my hat. when i stood up to take a piss, they cleared the rest room. i'd walk down the street and traffic stopped, mouths gaped. you know why? you know why, frank?}
<P>__{(now shouting)}
<D>__{i was rainbow fucking randolph! that's why!}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{are you through?}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{what? you're in a hurry? you don't have time for me? the guy who earned for you? the guy who put those fucking suits on your back and the pheasant au vin in your brooklyn mouth?}

<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{the ugly truth is, your shoes have become my shoes. as long as the rhino's on the air, everything's by the book. no skim, no percentage. nothing. the network wanted squeaky clean and they got it. and believe me, mopes is sparkling.}

<D>__{okay, time out, people! if i may interject, i think we're putting the cart before the horse here...}
<A>__{nora throws him an icy look.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{smoochy's still earning the trust of the kids. we don't want to compromise that by asking them to buy shampoo and cheese. how 'bout we just concentrate on doing the best show possible. huh? without all the bells and whistles and rickata rackita. what do you say, guys?}

<D>__{good meeting today. i thought we tackled some hot issues. although, i will be honest, there were a few times that i felt my voice wasn't being heard.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i think that's a conservative estimate.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i just want the show to have some weight, you know? some substance. silly songs, sure but with a message. pop quiz: how many original compositions are in the smoochy songbook?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{do you sense my complete lack of interest?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{try two thousand. covering every topic from how yummy vegetables are to the importance of donating plasma. don't you get it, nora? i'm a valuable resource. use me.}

<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{the only reason you're on tv right now is because rainbow randolph is a degenerate scumbag. i didn't discover you, i delivered you. like a bag of groceries. i have a bigger emotional investment in my nail polish. so don't peddle your sap to me, rhino. your job is just to smile and nod your head.}

<D>__{... no, no, you misunderstand me. it's not that i'm literally comparing captain kangaroo to jesus christ. i'm just saying that the captain, like christ, was someone you could believe in. those guys didn't care about bells and whistles and rickita rackata. it was all about the work. especially jesus. forget about it.}

<D>__{yeah, before the asshole found religion. anyway, stokes was trying to screw my boy out of some merchandising points. claimed he had a warehouse full of dicky dolls that weren't moving. now frank and i are old friends, so i say to him, 'okay, cock, show me the warehouse' see, i know the fucking warehouse is in the bronx, and i know it's emptier than my wife's head.}
