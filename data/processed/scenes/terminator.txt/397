<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior service station day}
<A>__{the gas station is like an oasis of clutter in a rolling stretch of meadows and woods. it consists of a bunker like building with restrooms and a flanking picnic area, beyond which are woods. people sit under the trees, enjoying the beautiful day while children tear around after the forced inactivity of a long trip. the three of them get out on unsteady legs.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{you can still ride if you wanna hang out for a couple hours.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{bag some z's?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{let's get cleaned up, kyle.}
<A>__{she heads for the women's restroom and kyle follows her inside.}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(pushing him out)}
<D>__{yours is over there.}
<A>__{instead of following her directions to the men's room, kyle wanders toward the drinking fountain. a bunch of kids are running around and throwing water at each other with paper cups. reese shambles through them like a zombie. he stands among the children, an alien in this land without fear. he watches people at picnic tables laughing and listening to portable music. kids squeal. dogs bark.}
<C>__{little girl }
<D>__{can you get my balloon?}
<A>__{down angle on an achingly beautiful little girl of about four. she points above his head. reese looks up to see a helium filled mylar balloon stuck in the foliage of a tree just above him. he pulls it down by the string and holds it, turning it over dully. he crouches down to her eye level. she smiles.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{aren't you afraid to be out in the open like this?}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{reese whirls reflexively at a scream behind him. the mylar balloon bursts in his tense hands. a teenage girl is being doused with water by the boys with plastic jugs. the little girl looks at the broken balloon, then glares at reese. she punches him soundly on the shoulder and storms off. at this moment she is bowled over by an irish setter that licks her face while she shrieks with laughter. reese seems about to smile but doesn't quite know how to go about it.}
