<L>__{interior trans siberian restaurant night}
<D>__{nikolai heaves kirill into a chair. semyon is back at his novel and watches as kirill attempts to get to his feet and then stumbles to the floor. he slumps down, now totally unconscious, breathing deeply. nikolai smiles.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{we went to a kurdish place. they don't even celebrate christmas. semyon steps up to where kirill is lying and stands over him for a moment. then he kicks him hard in the guts with all his might. nikolai is shocked, and grabs semyon's arm. a hand laid upon him is like deadly poison. kirill grunts and moans.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{hey, papa, what did i do? this is merry christmas or what? semyon kicks him hard in the guts again.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i think he's had enough. nikolai steps in between semyon and kirill. semyon is shocked that anyone should face him like this.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{who... the fuck... are you to tell me enough? nikolai's face hardens.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{we're partners. nikolai looks down at kirill.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{he's thunder, i'm lightning. he makes all the noise, i do all the damage.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{i hired you as a driver... semyon bends to roughly hoist kirill into a chair.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{...someone to stop him killing himself.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{well, you got more than a driver. nikolai reaches into his pocket for a business card and offers it to semyon. as semyon looks at the card in the candle light, he also sees the tattoo of an eagle on nikolai's hand. it is obvious that the tattoo means more than the card to semyon, and he reacts.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{i run a mini cab business.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{albanians, chechens, russians. they deliver packages. anything. anywhere. a pause.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{i only took this job so that i could get to meet you.}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{i think you and i could do business together. a pause. semyon looks at nikolai with utter contempt.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{i have no idea what business you're talking about. now get out. nikolai smiles and then leaves. semyon watches him go then peers at his drunken, sleeping son with something approaching compassion.}
