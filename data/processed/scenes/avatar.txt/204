<A>__{outside the windows, clouds and cliffs pass by, lit by polyphemus. jake is yanking stuff out of the samson's trauma bag, while grace lies curled across two back seats, hugging her blood soaked abdomen. she is pale and shocky. trudy is flying on visual only, by the light of polyphemus. her instruments are showing gibberish.}
