<A>__{follow the students as they burst into their home street. they have been joined by a motley collection of citizens including burghers and an old eccentric man father mabeuf who works as hard as anyone. they raid a fencing shop and a gun shop for weapons, they force wives to give up their husbands' muskets and chalk up the debt to the revolution on their front doors, they encourage homeowners to contribute furniture sometimes appearing at high windows to help overcome any reluctance. soon the street is raining tables, chairs, mattresses, sofas. they smash streetlamps. they set to work to build their barricade. students commandeer an omnibus which is overturned to form the barricade's heart. three students arrive in the street hauling an uprooted tree. they pull up paving stones, rip boards, timbers and front doors from house and shop fronts, pull down buttresses, and raid the cafe musain, systematically stripping it of every item of furniture despite the lamentations and protestations of madame hucheloup and her barmaid. as the barricade rises they bring down from the first floor of the cafe the rifles and ammunition they've gathered, to prepare to defend their chosen ground. a student stands on a stone post distributing weapons. they line the first and second floor front rooms with paving stones to create protected shooting positions. the inside of the barricade is built neatly with steps up made from paving stones. the outside is a crazy knarled mess.}
