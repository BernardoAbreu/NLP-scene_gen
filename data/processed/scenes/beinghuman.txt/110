<A>__{hector is walking along the beach, close to a pile of discarded boxes and crates. he quickly searches through them. he soon finds what he is looking for, a piece of wood with some nails still attached to it. he pulls out the nails and pockets them, then continues to rummage amongst the wood for more. hector is a survivor. and not the first hector to scavenge on a beach, in a world that feels big and empty.}
