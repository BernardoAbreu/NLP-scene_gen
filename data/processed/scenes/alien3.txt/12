<L>__{exterior surgace of arceon day}
<A>__{a howling dust storm has kicked up. the monks wear small round goggles, have rags tied over their noses, as they work at a huge block and tackle arrangement hundreds of ropes grow taut. timbers groan. they lift ripley's ship swing it over to a large portal }
<L>__{interior ripley's room day}
<A>__{ripley lays with eyes closed. muffled voices outside her door:}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{how is the woman, john?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't think she's here yet.}
<A>__{at the sound of john's voice the slightest smile plays across ripley's sleeping lips.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{she is close, though.}
<A>__{as they continue talking, ripley wakes. opens her eyes. rolls over onto her side there is a window right next to the bed. ripley lifts herself up on one elbow, looks out:}
<B>__{her pov}
<A>__{garden of earthly delights... monks laboring under a beautiful, celestial blue sky picking apples, fishing on the water on small inland lakes. working with hammer and saw on small wooden cottages. lyrical. it makes her feel good. she scans the countryside... sheep graze around wooden ladders stretching hundreds of feet up to the ripley does a take }
<B>__{workers on a scaffolding}
<A>__{with crude brushes at the end of poles paint the sky blue. the abbey, the cottages, the fields outside her window are all on one level inside the planet. the vaulted ceiling, painted to look like the sky with huge glass "windows" to allow the sunlight in, is actually the underside of the planetoid's outer shell. ripley looks back at the monks on the ground: instead of repairing, they are taking the cabins apart, stacking the wood onto push carts }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what the hell ?}
<A>__{suddenly the sulaco escape ship appears in front of her. swings past her window suspended by ropes. then disappears up, out of sight. ripley checks her pulse.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{this must be a dream. a bad one.}
<A>__{she rolls back onto the bed. stares up at the ceiling. above her on the roof of the abbey monks scurry around the ship as it is lowered into place on a flat area of the roof above the libaray. it seats with a deeply resounding thud...}
<B>__{ripley}
<A>__{hears the sound and then another her door opening. she turns to find the abbot and john standing in the doorway. john waits in the doorway as the abbot crosses to the chair by the bed and sits.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{i am the abbot. leader of this colony. and you?}
<A>__{he smiles. open. friendly.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{ripley. how did i get here?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{your vehicle crash landed.}
<P>__{(indicates john)}
<D>__{brother john found you and brought you here.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{where is here?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{this is the minorite abbey within the manmade orbiter arceon.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{can i use a radio to }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{we have no radio here. we are a monastic order that has renounced all modern technology. we live the old way. the pure way.}
<A>__{she shakes her head.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{uh, i i still don't feel 100%. whoever took me out of the stasis tube must not have run the full d f program... where's newt?}
<A>__{the abbot looks at her blankly.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{there was a little girl with me }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{you were alone.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{no. she was with me. i put her in her stasis tube we launched when the }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{you were the only living thing found aboard that vessel.}
<A>__{the abbot watches ripley as the terrible truth overcomes her }
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{oh, god. newt.}
<A>__{she stops gets that chill up her spine she realizes that she must have brought the alien with her.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{it came with us.}
<A>__{the abbot leans in.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{what came with you?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{listen there is a danger here. it came with me. how long have i been here?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{almost two days }
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(calculates)}
<D>__{loose for two days. this planet could be overrun within the week.}
<A>__{ripley grabs the abbot by his cassock }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{look, there's a xenomorph }
<P>__{(sees his confusion)}
<D>__{an alien creature. a killer. a monster. and now it's here.}
<A>__{the abbot looks at her the way you look at that guy on the corner of santa monica and 3rd who's babbling about judgement day. the guy with his pants down around his kness. she sees this, releases her hold on him...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{calm down, ripley. okay, i was with a platoon of colonial marines on a mission to planetoid lv426. we left earth six months ago maybe a year }
<C>__{abbot}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{wait a moment }
<A>__{the abbot becomes aware of john's presence in the doorway. turns over his shoulder at him.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{leave us.}
<A>__{john waits there a beat, then backs out and closes the door.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{continue.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{we launched in the cruiser sulaco from gateway sub orbital space station }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{not possible.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{when we left earth seventy years ago, it was on the brink of a new dark age. technology was on the verge of destroying the planet's environment. a computer virus was threatening to wipe away all recorded knowledge. there didn't seem to be any way it could be averted. in the almost forty years since we were towed out here in hypersleep, the news that came with occasional supply ships only got worse. finally, the ships stopped coming. we had to resign ourselves to the fact that worst had come to pass, and the earth no longer existed.}
<A>__{now she gives him that look.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{uh...all right... forget the earth how many people do you have here? let's worry about them. warn them }
<A>__{a new look overtakes the abbot's face. a look of fear. now she's getting to him or is she? he abruptly stands.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{your mind is troubled. you need to rest some more.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i don't need rest i need to get to your people. you've got to get to them tell them about the alien }
<A>__{he heads for the door }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{i have had enough for now.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{enough? didn't you hear what i said? it could wipe out the entire population of this planet. it may have started already have there been any unusual deaths since i got here?}
<A>__{the abbot stops in the door }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{no. and there won't be.}
<A>__{the abbot slams the door behind him. the corridor outside ripley's room day john stands nearby as the abbot addresses two burly monks}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{bolt it.}
<A>__{the guards move to bolt the door.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what is it what's wrong?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{your patient is in a dangerous mental state. nobody gets in or out until i say so.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{but i. her meals }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{nobody.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{father, i don't understand }
<A>__{the abbot turns and disappears down the hall. john looks from the departing abbot to the two guard monks. the library night john has his head buried in his hands. his back rises and falls with the rhythmic breathing of sleep. mattias curled up on his feet. asleep as well. wham! the library door flies open ! john sits bolt upright a hysterical monk bursts in. rushes to john's table.}
<C>__{hysterical monk}
<D>__{brother john! you're here! the abbot said you'd i need you're the medic }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{hysterical monk}
<D>__{my sandy she's ill }
<A>__{john tries to rub the fitfull sleep out of his eyes.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{huh? a woman?}
<C>__{hysterical monk}
<D>__{sandy. my ewe.}
<A>__{john returns his head to the table.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{one of your sheep? jesus christ. call a vet.}
<C>__{hysterical monk}
<D>__{father anselm was the vet.}
<A>__{john looks under his arms at mattias the dog just stares at him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you're no help. okay, let me get my bag. all creatures great and small...}
