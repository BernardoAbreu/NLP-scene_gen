<C>__{emily }
<D>__{brendan, i know you're mad at all these people, cause you think i went away from you and went to them. but you've got to start seeing it as my decision, stop being angry because where i want to be at's different from where you wanna be at.}

<A>__{she buries her face in his shoulder. he has a hard time speaking.}

<C>__{emily }
<D>__{let me go.}
<A>__{as she pulls away he mechanically slips an address book from her jacket pocket. he watches her as she walks away.}
