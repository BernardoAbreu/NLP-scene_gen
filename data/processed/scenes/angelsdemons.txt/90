<A>__{vittoria, the camerlengo, and the two swiss guard reach the entrance to the holy vatican grottoes just as their power goes out. two flashlights click on, and the guardsmen lead the way in. on both sides, hollow niches line the walls. recessed in the alcoves, as far as the flashlights let them see, the hulking shadows of sarcophagi loom. on top of each tomb are life sized marble carvings of each pope, shown in death and wearing full papal vestments, arms folded across their chests.}

<D>__{if the holy father was murdered, the implications are profound. vatican security is impenetrable, no one from the outside could have gotten anywhere near him.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{meaning it was someone on the inside.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{we can trust no one}
<A>__{he steps up his pace, taking the lead, knows exactly where he's going. the others fall behind, as everyone slowly realizes what he intends to do. and they're not at all sure they're up for it. at the late pope's sarcophagus, the camerlengo closes the last few feet alone. he knees down in front of the bright marble carving, a likeness of the late pope. he whispers.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{father... holy father... you told me when i was young that the voice in my heart was that of god. you told me i must follow it no matter what painful places it leads. i hear it now, asking me the impossible. give me strength. forgive me. what i do, i do in the name of everything you believe.}
<A>__{behind him, the others watch as he finishes his private prayer, stands, and turns to them.}

<D>__{remove the covering.}
<A>__{nobody moves. just stares at him.}
<C>__{camerlengo }
<D>__{did you hear me?}
<C>__{swiss guardsman}
<D>__{signore, by law we are at your command. but we are also bound by }
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{i ask your forgiveness for putting you in this position. vatican laws are established to protect the church. but it is in that very spirit that i command you to break them now.}
<A>__{a moment of silence, and then they step forward. set their flashlights on the floor. and step to the tomb. bracing their hands against the marble covering near the head of the tomb, they plant their feet and push. it doesn't move. they push harder. vittoria and the camerlengo join them. with an almost primal growl of stone on stone, the lid slides, rotating off the top of the casket and coming to rest at an angle. the camerlengo picks up a flashlight and shines it in the crypt. vittoria leans forward. the light creeps up the pope's body, over his burial vestments, past his folded hands, and finally to his face. his cheeks have collapsed, the pope's mouth gapes wide and his tongue is black as death.}
