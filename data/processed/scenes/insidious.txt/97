<L>__{interior corridor, new house continuous}
<A>__{ hallway. renai and josh stay back, sheepish. elise stalks forward at the front, surveying every nook and cranny of the house. elise stops suddenly. she is staring straight at a corner of the hallway, next to the grandfather clock.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{there is something here.}
<C>__{tucker}
<D>__{this is where i saw it.}
<A>__{elise calmly mutters something to specs in a low voice, but we have trouble hearing it only snatches of key words.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{...long hair...grey dress...her eyes are...}
<A>__{he immediately starts sketching. his line drawings are fast but detailed. impressive. he outlines the wall, the ceiling lamp, the grandfather clock. and then something else... two young women. standing next to the grandfather clock, dressed in amish garb. even in the roughness of the drawing, we can make out their pleading eyes and pale skin. tucker takes out a camera, snaps some shots. josh and renai step forward, seeing the sketch. elise keeps moving, heading straight for one door in particular. she stops, running her hand over the wood.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{do i have permission to enter this room?}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{maybe you could wait back there?}
<A>__{josh and renai hug each other. tucker lowers the camera. elise grips the door handle and turns it.}
