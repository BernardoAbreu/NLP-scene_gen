<L>__{interior pyramid catacombs night}
<A>__{a vast dark maze. milburn and fifield grope their way through the dark with flashlights. the storm howls outside.}
<C>__{milburn}
<D>__{what are you looking for?}
<C>__{fifield}
<P>__{(groping along the wall)}
<D>__{someplace things can't come at us.}
<C>__{milburn}
<D>__{what's gonna come at us?}
<L>__{interior magellan vickers's suite night}
<A>__{david stands beside vickers at her holography terminal. he lays his hand on over a signal plate and the terminal lights up with a three dimensional image. the core chamber of the pyramid, from david's point of view. it's apparent that david's eyes see more than human eyes do. he seems to see heat and electromagnetic energy as well as visible light; calibrated readouts are overlaid on the scene. the structures in the pyramid are surrounded by complicated patterns of energy. this is incomprehensible technology.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the core of the pyramid. you see.}
<A>__{vickers goes rigid, looking at it: avarice in her eyes.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{we're going to protocol two.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{laboratory}
<A>__{a high tech science facility behind glass. watts and holloway, in lab gloves and smocks, open the dumbwaiter: an engineer's head rises into view, ghoulish and elephantine. vapor rises from it. a readout blinks: sterilized. they lift it onto the steel table. it takes both of them. they pass scanners over the skull. images accumulate and rotate on the laboratory displays. x ray and ultrasound. holloway leans close to study an x ray image. he almost seems to see a ghostly second face...}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{martin. look.}
<A>__{she traces the head with an ultrasound probe: under the vibrations a seam opens up around the edge of the face. she gets a fingertip into the seam. works with a probe. pries away the long dead engineer's mask. it comes free. the visage revealed is human, except for its giant scale. white skinned. earless. hairless. withered but beautiful as a greek statue. eyes closed. an expression of suffering on its face. watts drops the ultrasound probe in shock.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{they look like us.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{we look like them. genesis 1:27. "and god created man in his own image. in his own image created he him."}
<A>__{vickers and david stand outside the lab window, staring in at the god's head. vickers looks shaken. david, fascinated. watts covers her nose in revulsion. a horrible stench: the engineer head begins to disintegrate in front of them. flesh oozing, skin peeling. accelerated decay.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{it's breaking down.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{formaldehyde!}
<A>__{urgently they ransack cabinets and storage rooms. watts finds a clear plastic drum and dumps its contents. holloway drags five gallon jugs of preservative out of a cabinet. david watches through the window, almost amused.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{mortal after all.}
<A>__{they lift the rotting head into the drum, retching. fingers skidding in putrefaction. they pour formaldehyde over it. as soon as the head is immersed they rush to strip off their reeking gloves and smocks, scrubbing their hands. the god's head sits in its murky vat, shedding skin and tofu like chunks of white flesh. the noble face disintegrating. watts and holloway stare at it, breathing hard from their work. vickers flicks on the intercom from outside the window.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{your cadaver's interesting. but i'm more interested in the machinery in the pyramid. the core chamber. what do you think it does?}
<A>__{watts stares at vickers incredulously.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{how could anyone know...}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{i know what it does.}
<A>__{silence. holloway looks at vickers wearily, as if he's seen this conversation coming. he glances at watts.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{think. what we've seen. what we know.}
<A>__{watts rises to the challenge. thinking on her feet.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{twenty four pyramids scattered around the moon's equator. massive power supplies. vents in the walls. atmosphere changes. breeder tanks...}
<P>__{(she's got it)}
<D>__{the pyramids are terraforming machines.}
<A>__{holloway grins, exuberant. his theory playing out perfectly. he doesn't see vickers stiffen. her hands curling into fists.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{that's why earth's ancient cultures built pyramids: in imitation of the gods.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{twelve thousand years ago, beings from the sky set pyramids on the earth and transformed the world. that's what they were doing here before their civilization failed.}
<A>__{watts stares at the head in its tank. the severed neck.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{it didn't fail. it was wiped out.}
