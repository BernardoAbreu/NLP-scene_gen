<D>__{i found him like this.}
<A>__{greer is lying supine on the floor. his legs are rigid and his trunk is extended. his arms are flexed and twisted so that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other. murphy kneels beside him. greer's eyelids are half closed, his eyes rolled up into his head. his jaw is clenched, face contorted in a bizarre grimace. and he speaks, uttering nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in tongues.}
