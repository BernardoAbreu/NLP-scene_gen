<D>__{he was in full restraints? and the door was locked?}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{yes, sir. did it myself.}
<C>__{dr. fletcher}
<D>__{and he was fully sedated?}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{he was fully sedated!}
<C>__{dr. fletcher}
<D>__{then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?}
<A>__{dr. fletcher indicates an impossibly tiny vent high in the wall.}
