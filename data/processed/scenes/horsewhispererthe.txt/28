<L>__{intercut exterior woods day}
<A>__{liz hammond on a cellular, walking away from the crowd.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{annie, it's liz. how's grace?}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(journalistic)}
<D>__{her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. she had some bleeding but it's under control.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{oh god, annie, i'm so sorry. i... i know you're being hit with a low now, i don't want to take too much of your time but i have to talk to you about pilgrim.}
<A>__{annie hears the name as if it's some distant echo she can't quite identify; liz speaks quickly as annie watches grace breathing in her sleep }
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{it's not good. i've never seen an animal with these injuries still breathing. i know this is difficult to hear right now i'd like your permission to put him down. it's the really best thing we can do for }
<A>__{that was too much information for annie;}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{wait, uh, i, i don't understand. start again he's alive...}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well, of course, right...}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{we really shouldn't wait...}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{hold on, liz...}
<P>__{(to robert)}
<D>__{something about pilgrim...}
<A>__{the doctor pokes his head in.}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{mr. and mrs. maclean...}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{ put him down. she says...}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(overlapping, to doctor)}
<D>__{yes. hi.}
<P>__{(to annie)}
<D>__{tell her you'll call her back.}
<A>__{he exits with the doctor.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{liz, listen, the doctor's here and i just can't, uh... talk now... so }
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i understand, but annie, please...}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{ see, what you can do for him ...}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{annie, no matter what i do, this horse will never be the same.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{... i just don't know right now! do whatever you can and when grace is }
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{it isn't right to make him suffer...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{and i can say the same thing about my daughter! but she is suffering! can you solve that problem!}
<P>__{(liz is quiet)}
<D>__{i can't deal with this now, liz! if you need a yes or no right now, then no don't do it! not until i know grace is all right. now, please! just do what you can. okay?}
<P>__{(softer)}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{liz is stopped by annie's almost pleading tone.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{all right...}
<A>__{they hang up. annie takes a breath. robert re enters.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{nothing new. he's just going off duty.}
<A>__{beat. silence.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i'm going to get all the nurses' names... it's good to know all their names.}
<A>__{robert nods. but neither of them moves. they stand motionless for a beat, then annie begins to break down and eases herself into robert's arms. robert embraces her, kissing her head, with an almost fatherly comfort. his expression tells us it's the moment he's been expecting... and wanting. now she'll be all right, in his arms. whatever distance between them, whatever problems felt insurmountable last night on the phone, are now, for the moment for robert gone. but annie's expression tells us something different. her instinct to hold him was honest... but the effect isn't the same anymore. something doesn't feel right. something isn't working anymore about his comforting embrace.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i should go get some of her things.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{no, let me go.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(gently pushing away)}
<D>__{no, i will go. you stay... in case she wakes up.}
