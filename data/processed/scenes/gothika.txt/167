<L>__{interior hospital waiting room night}
<A>__{the door to tracy's room is closed. we find pete where we left him, by the soda machine, fighting to stay awake. moving toward him, we come to rest on the back of his neck. so tight we can actually see the hairs on the back of his neck. and as he feels the swoosh of a cold whisper, they stand up on their ends. pete turns to tracy's room to notice that the door is now open. strange. he stands up and walks to the door.}
