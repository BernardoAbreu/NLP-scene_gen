<L>__{interior trans siberian restaurant. kitchen night}
<D>__{the place is winding up. chefs and waiters are cleaning surfaces and dishes. the only still point is semyon, who is cutting and wrapping the birthday cake in small parcels of golden paper. he works intensely and delicately at the back of the kitchen. nikolai and kirill enter. kirill swigs a half drunk glass of wine.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{that girl you fucked in front of me... you remember her? the ukrainian bitch?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{so they kick down the door. these are ordinary fucking police. they ask for her by name and they take her away. some fucking punter must have given them her name. what gives the police the right to take our women, huh? semyon shoots kirill a hard look: he's talking too much and too loudly. kirill ignores the look.}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{hey papa, i never seen so many old people in one place. whose party is it out there? the angel of death?}
<C>__{semyon}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{she is one hundred years old. semyon works on for a moment then glances at kirill.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{kirill, go down into the cellar and bring up some brandy. twelve bottles. kirill turns to leave.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{come on, nikolai, help me.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{no. he stays here. i want to talk business. a confused pause. kirill looks from nikolai to his father.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{what business? a pause as kirill suddenly senses his exclusion.}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{papa, what business? his business is my business. semyon stares at kirill and kirill knows the look.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{go to the cellar kirill. and take your time. kirill hesitates. he is angry as hell but too scared of his father's gaze to say anything. finally he turns fast and departs, slamming his open hand against the door as he goes. semyon waits a moment before returning to the business of cutting the cake. finally...}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{did you deal with the old man? nikolai nods. a pause. semyon looks up and fixes nikolai with a stare.}
<C>__{semyon }
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{it's time you joined us. a long moment. the thing nikolai has been working for has finally happened. there seems to be little joy.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{thank you. papa. semyon returns to his work. nikolai hesitates.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{what shall i tell kirill? semyon continues with the cake, unconcerned.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{tell him i changed my mind about the brandy.}
