<A>__{robin keeps going. a hand clasps his shoulder. spins him 'round.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{do i know you?}
<A>__{robin gazes into space, trying to look blind. the guard sniffs his soiled hand.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{my god, you stink!}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{pardon my blindness, sir. i'm always falling down.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{yeech! get away from me.}
<A>__{he launches a kick in robin's rear. robin hobbles away, hiding a smile. the guard tries to wipe off his hand on the wall.}
