<L>__{interior brokerage house meeting room day}
<A>__{stuckey enters. edward is standing at the end of a long meeting table. he is serving himself coffee from a tray.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<P>__{(gloating)}
<D>__{you were right. kross mortgaged everything he has down to his grandson's college tuition to secure loans from a bank. not just any bank. one we do business with.}
<A>__{edward just sips his coffee.}
<C>__{stuckey }
<D>__{it goes without saying that your business means a great deal more to them than our friend kross's.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{all you have to do is make a call.}
<A>__{edward is silent. stuckey is again surprised.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? first, you go soft on the pension funds. now, you're giving him the chance to get away? as of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{come on, bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. it's my money.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{and some of it's mine. edward, his jugular's exposed.}
<A>__{edward hesitates. then:}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{get the bank on the phone for me.}
