<L>__{interior grandpa reaches trailer late day}
<A>__{the holy man is sitting in his chair, smacking flies with a swatter. tonight he wears a black reservation hat and stares vacantly at the tv where ronald macdonald swings a giant baseball bat, and falls on his face, bouncing back up. and then boom! the door is open and cooch leads miles, sherman and ray inside. cooch has a gun on the old man.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{hands on your head!}
<A>__{the old man slowly removes his hat and hangs it on a knee. carefully he places his wrinkled hands on his thinning white hair. his eyes seek out ray who stands in the doorway, m 16 in hand, looking concerned. he stares at ray. cooch storms into a back bedroom, miles moves to a window. sherman stands over the old man.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{where is he, sam? where's jimmy?}
<A>__{grandpa looks at sherman, ignores him, looks back at ray.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{he's a medicine man, ray. the "spiritual leader" of the warriors. that right, sam?}
<A>__{with radio transmissions crackling through the house, cooch comes back down the hall, and heads to the door.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{trailer's clean, let's go.}
<A>__{ray starts to follow but he sees sherman pick something up from near grandpa. the 500 year old turtleshell rattle. grandpa's eyes widen slightly.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{you been the one making it rain like that, out there, sam?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hey, put that down.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{can you make jimmy outrun an m 16, sam?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{sherman!}
<A>__{sherman drops the turtleshell rattle on the linoleum floor. then drives his heel into it, crushing the fragile turtleshell. ray grabs him and slams him into the tin wall. miles gets between them, grabbing sherman.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{easy, men! hey! }
<C>__{radio}
<D>__{he's on the roof! he's on the fucking roof! come on guys, come on, guys!}
<A>__{they're out the door, leaving the old man to sit looking down at the shattered rattle. he closes his eyes.}
