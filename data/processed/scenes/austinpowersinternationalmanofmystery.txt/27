<A>__{we see a plane taking off in silhouette.}
<L>__{exterior plane in flight day}
<A>__{a multi colored psychedelic jumbo jet with austin's logo on the tailpiece.}
<L>__{interior private psychedelic jet}
<A>__{the inside looks like hugh heffner's jet... rust shag carpet, brown walls, and beads. austin and vanessa sit on beanbag chairs. vanessa works on her lap top.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{pretty groovy jumbo jet, eh? how does a hot chick like you end up working at the ministry of defense?}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{i went to oxford and excelled in several subjects, but i ended up specializing in foreign languages. i wanted to travel see the world. in my last year i was accepted into the m.o.d. in the cultural studies sector. i thought i was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. it's very boring. my whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in farsi. if i do well with this case, i finally get promoted to field operative...}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{that's fascinating, vanessa. listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{i've been frozen for thirty years, man, i want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{my wedding tackle.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{my meat and two veg.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{mr. powers, please. i know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. i would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{have you ever made love to a chigro?}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{a chigro?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{you know, a chigro... part chinese, part negro... chigro.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<P>__{(offended)}
<D>__{we don't use the term 'negro' anymore. it's considered offensive.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{that's right. you're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?}
<P>__{(spotting the flight attendants)}
<D>__{here's the stewardesses! bring on the sexy stews!}
<A>__{the stewardesses enter. they're not dressed very sexily. one of them is a man and another wears braces.}
<C>__{flight attendant}
<D>__{excuse me, did you say 'stewardess'? we're called 'flight attendants' now, thank you very much.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{oh, i get it, it's like 'i'm not a whore, i'm a sex worker', baby.}
<C>__{flight attendant}
<D>__{my name is mrs. wilkenson. there are a few things we need to discuss. first of all, we're not wearing these.}
<A>__{she holds up some skimpy, lingerie type flight outfits.}
<C>__{flight attendant}
<D>__{also, i have some questions about the itinerary. it says here, '4:30 dinner, 5:30 everyone gets naked and covered with baby oil, 6:00 orgy'?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{seems pretty straightforward, don't you think...listen darling, i think you're a fabulous bird. can i get your telephone number?}
<C>__{flght attendant}
<P>__{(mock sexy)}
<D>__{sure, it's easy to remember.}
<P>__{(writing on his hand)}
<D>__{it's 777 film. we have to prepare the craft for take off now.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{smashing! when we land i will give you a tinkle on the telling bone.}
<A>__{the flight attendant gives him a chilly stare and then exits.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{brrrr! she must be frigid. there's two things i know about life: one, americans will never take to soccer. two, swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag! they're shag mad, man! let me ask you a question, vanessa, and be honest.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{do i make you horny?}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{do i make you horny? randy, you know. to you, am i eros manifest?}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{i hope this is part of the unfreezing process.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{listen, vanessa, i'm a swinger... that's what i do, i swing.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{i understand that, mr. powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. i will never have sex with you, ever. if you were the last man on earth and i was the last woman on earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, i still would not have sex with you.}
<A>__{austin is oblivious.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{what's you point, vanessa?}
