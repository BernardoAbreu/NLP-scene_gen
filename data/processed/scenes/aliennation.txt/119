<L>__{interior elevator night}
<A>__{they enter the empty elevator. jetson presses the button to descend.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{no, see, i don't leave you alone... i'm your partner. i don't work that way... tug didn't work that way.}
<A>__{jetson remains steadfast. sykes, about to explode, slams his palm against the red emergency stop button and the elevator lurches to a halt between floors.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{no secrets, goddammit! you don't hold back from me. whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(agonizing)}
<D>__{no. i cannot involve you. this is not your concern.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{the hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough c 4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that slag was on something, and not sour milk, either? am i right?}
<P>__{(he has backed jetson}
<D>__{to the wall by sheer}
<P>__{force of will)}
<D>__{tell me! what is it?}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{... it is called ss'jabroka'. to us it is a potent narcotic.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{how potent?}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{like your cocaine, i suppose. the "high" lasts several hours. we would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{we? you've taken it?}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{we all did.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{where did he get it? was there any of it on the ship?}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{no... i am sure not. that is why i am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.}
<P>__{(emphatically)}
<D>__{but none of my people know how to make it. the process was carefully guarded.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(as the enormity sinks in)}
<D>__{jesus, this is major.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me sooner? why'd you hold out on me?}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{your people don't know about this part of out past. and they can't know it would threaten our entire existence here.}
<A>__{the voltage runs out of sykes. he seems to understand jetson's dilemma.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{george... look me in the eye... george, you don't ever lie to me again.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{i must trust you, matthew. i cannot stop this without you.}
<A>__{sykes stare at jetson... absorbing the enormity of the earth shattering secret this alien has asked him to keep.}
