<L>__{exterior ship thames almost dawn}
<A>__{anthony, a young sailor of about 20, is standing at the rail of a ship. we see the obscure shape of rigging and sails behind him. the cries of sailors echo. behind him stand the gentleman and the banker. they are looking past anthony, looking at something. they move away as anthony peers through the fog, straining to see... london. gradually, as the ship approaches, the towering spires and mountainous rooftops of the city begin to stand out in relief, to emerge through the fog like a tiger creeping toward its prey. music continues as anthony takes in the dreadful and magnificent spectacle of the 19th century metropolis. the gnarl of rooftops. the labyrinth of streets and alleys. the black trails of smoke reaching up like skeletal fingers from a thousand chimneys. london. sulfurous london. anthony is awestruck.}

<D>__{i have sailed the world, beheld its wonders from the dardanelles to the mountains of peru, but there's no place like london !}
<A>__{then sweeney todd steps to anthony's side, grimly interrupting }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no, there's no place like london.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{mr. todd...?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you are young. life has been kind to you. you will learn.}
<A>__{todd's glares forward, his haunted gaze never leaving the approaching city.}
