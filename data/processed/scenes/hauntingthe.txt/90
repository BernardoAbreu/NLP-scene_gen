<L>__{interior greenhouse day}
<A>__{marrow lets nell into a long, victorian era greenhouse. it's overgrown, lush, the leaded glass panes above stained with years of condensation and pollen. vines and trees climb up the sides. beds of flowers and plants line narrow footpaths of brick. nell leans down to look into a water garden with a statue of a man bursting from the surface, grasping for the air as if he had been drowning. a sudden rumble runs throughout the greenhouse. and a cavalcade of water comes out of the statue's mouth surprising nell. she lets out a little yelp, and then laughs with marrow. nell loves the greenhouse. it takes her breath away.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{oh... it's so beautiful...}
<A>__{nell makes her way among the plants. she looks up at a towering, double helix staircase which rises from the floor to a platform which gives access to the roof. below the staircase are planters filled with violets.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{violets. somebody must've died here.}
<A>__{and then, out of the corners, comes mister dudley.}
<C>__{mr. dudley}
<D>__{that's where she hanged herself.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{mr. dudley}
<D>__{rene crain. up there. rope. ship's hawser. hard to tie. don't know how she got it.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{that's enough, mister dudley.}
<C>__{mr. dudley}
<D>__{she stepped off the platform.}
<P>__{(he looks up, with a suggestive leer)}
<D>__{they had long skirts in those days.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{thank you, mister dudley, please...}
<C>__{mr. dudley}
<D>__{house is full of stories. if you know how to read these things, it's an open book. just a different library than the kind you're used to.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mr. dudley}
<D>__{why'd she kill herself?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mr. dudley}
<P>__{(what other reason is there?)}
<D>__{she was unhappy.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mr. dudley}
<D>__{can't say. haven't been here that long.}
<P>__{(he's off)}
<D>__{well, it's labor day, gotta get to work.}
<A>__{and off he goes.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{that's a horrible story.}
<A>__{nell looks up, and smiles.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{you're smiling.}
<A>__{marrow watches her as she moves about, takes a heavy, ripe bloom in hand, lifts it to her face. while she talks, she walks, and marrow follows.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i was just thinking how happy i am right now. all my life, i've been waiting for an adventure. and i thought, oh, i will never have that, adventures are for people who travel long distances, that's for soldiers, that's for the women that the bullfighters fall in love with. and here i am, and something is happening to me. strange noises in the night. paintings are calling to me. and all it cost to get there was five gallons of gas. i'm getting my adventure.}
<A>__{for the first time since we've seen nell, there is something to her which is simply... erotic. marrow follows her down one of the footpaths. she smiles back at marrow as he trails her. she reaches a transept in the greenhouse, and as she turns down it, there's the slightest sway to her gait. marrow follows her around the corner into the transept. at the far end the wall is completely overgrown. nell looks up through the ceiling at hill house looming grim outside, distorted in the old glass.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{someone is playing with you.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me. what i do with this is up to me. i can be a victim, or i can be a volunteer. and i want to be the volunteer.}
<A>__{nell glances at him, and for that split second she is raw, passionate woman. she walks away, the sway in her gait aching, powerful. marrow is surprised by what nell just said and stares at her as she comes to the overgrown end. nell reaches out to the hanging vines, pulls them aside... ...and a face stares out. gastly. white. nell takes an involuntary step back, a little gasp. the face is marble. blind eyes stare from stained cheeks. it is a statue of crain. marrow comes over. it's an enormous stone tableaux of hugh surrounded by cherubim. the plants have attacked it as if trying to wipe its funerary presence from the greenhouse.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{hugh crain. can't seem to get away from him.}
<A>__{she laughs a little at herself. marrow joins in. he helps her pull the plants back to reveal more of it. she reaches out, touches the marble cheek. then daring, grins, and begins to hum her tune. marrow steps back to watch her do a sensual slow dance with hugh crain, pirouetting, her hips sliding past... hypnotizing marrow.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{what is that tune?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i don't know. a lullaby i guess. my mother used to hum it to me. and her mother before that, and so on.}
<P>__{(to the statue)}
<D>__{hugh crain, would you care to dance?}
<A>__{she hums another two notes, and bang! the door behind her slams open in a gust of wind, jolting nell. she stops and stares. outside the window, through the glass, she sees mr. dudley, staring at her, he's been watching her dance. the spell is broken. nell, embarrassed, can't bear to look at him. a beat, and then marrow goes over and shuts the door. when he turns back nell is just vanishing around the corner, her rapid footsteps echoing in the vaulted room.}
