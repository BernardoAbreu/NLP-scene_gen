<A>__{flipping through a stack of postcards he has just purchased, wills waits for charlotte to come out of the ladies room. he idly glances up as a stream of tourists moves past. he is about to look away when his eye catches someone. it is lisa, the young woman who spoke to charlotte at the benefit. around her neck she wears a chain bearing a met employee photograph i.d. she carries a take out coffee. wills follows her, agitated and curious. he sees her pass through a set of glass doors into the watson research library. he hurries over to the doors just in time to see her disappear behind a bank of card catalogues. wills notices a sign at the door that forbids entry to the public. he hesitates, then enters. he speaks to the first person he sees a rotund female librarian in her 60's. he stops and asks a question about lisa. she nods. wills is shaken by the answer. he stares into the middle distance, wondering what to do, his mind racing. the librarian, a little nervous now, reminds him that he is not allowed in the library. he snaps to, thanks her, and moves away. but then he stops, takes out a business card, and returns to the librarian. he is about to hand it to her, but then he thinks better of it. flustered, he thanks her again and exits. the librarian looks after him, confused and a little apprehensive.}
