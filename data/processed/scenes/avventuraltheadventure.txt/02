<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{meanwhile, left alone, claudia is pacing back and forth outside in front of the building. she is bored and obviously tired of waiting. then, as she is about to cross over to the other side of the street, she sees sandro and anna coming out of the doorway. the expression on anna's face hasn't changed she appears sad and gloomy. but claudia doesn't take note of it; she is too busy fuming over anna's lack of consideration, eager to let them both understand that she is sick and tired of waiting around. as sandro opens the window of the car, which is pointed towards milan, he says to claudia:}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(glancing first at sandro and then at anna)}
<D>__{that seems to apply to you also...}
<A>__{meanwhile, the driver has taken anna's suitcase out of the black car and puts it into sandro's. claudia picks up her own suitcase and is about to do the same but sandro intervenes and takes it from her.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{don't be so humble.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{how should i be ... arrogant?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{but of course... arrogant, haughty... hasn't anna ever told you?}
<A>__{while this exchange was going on, anna has already climbed into sandro's car. sandro follows and takes his place at the wheel; claudia gets in alongside him. the car takes off at high speed.}
