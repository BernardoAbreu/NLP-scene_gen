<L>__{interior arthur's apartment day}
<A>__{it's a few weeks later. the place is very, very messy. the place also seems to be heavily splattered with all colors of painterior splotch! a big lump of red paint thuds into hobson's giant teddy bear, which is already heavily spattered. arthur's sitting naked, apart from a helmet, in his tiny army paintball tank. he's in a blank, drunken daze, firing paint at the teddy. the tank turret rotates. he shoots walls, possessions, furniture. he stops.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{would frog ever get up again? or would he just sit in his tank, crying and soiling himself until he died of dehydration because he didn't even have the energy to eat a wet sandwich.}
<A>__{he looks down at an ashes urn.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{hobson! why are you in there when i need you?}
<P>__{(lifts lid off urn)}
<D>__{hobson!}
<A>__{he's rewarded with a face full of ashes. angrily he spins the turret through 360 degrees, firing painterior}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{arrrrgghhh!}
<A>__{marty comes in and is hit hard by painterior}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{how's the tea?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{shockingly bad, thanks, marty.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{want to talk about the cubs game?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{nahhh. can i be alone please?}
<A>__{marty goes. arthur picks up his phone and scrolls down to naomi's name. he thinks for a moment, hits `call'.}
