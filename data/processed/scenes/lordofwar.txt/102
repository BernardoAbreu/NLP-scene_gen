<P>__{(to the pilot)}
<D>__{he can't get far. i want a truck waiting on the tarmac.}
<L>__{exterior highway. day.}
<A>__{a heavily trafficked highway. women carrying water jars on their heads, a thin cow pulling the carcass of a car, vendors selling dry meat, children playing war games. the pedestrians look up to see the lumbering ilyushin making its final approach they scatter. the ilyushin weaves on landing, hits a bone jarring pothole. inside the plane boxes of grenades, bullets and other munitions jump dangerously up and down. finally, the ilyushin pulls up safely on the highway, engines shutting down. yuri's head appears out of the cockpit window. curious locals, recovered from the shock, are gathering at the side of the road.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(to the pilots, sizing up the locals)}
<D>__{we're going to be okay.}
<A>__{the pilots are already halfway out of the plane door, grabbing supplies as they go.}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(calling out from the window)}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{as far from the evidence as i can.}
<A>__{the pilots start running down the highway.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{wait, you idiots! there's not going to be any evidence! stay with the plane!}
<A>__{the pilots ignore him run for their lives. yuri is left alone. he turns a lever marked, "cargo bay".}
