<L>__{exterior dellas's house evening}
<A>__{this home too seems perfect until we notice the christmas star has fallen from the top of the tree and lies reflecting itself in a puddle on the wet lawn. suddenly we hear the sound of wings fluttering and see an owl among the branches of the christmas tree. it rises from the tree then swoops down to the lawn where it sweeps a mouse from the grass. the owl then soars off, casting a magnified shadow of her wings across the house, and disappears with it's prey into the woods behind. curtains part at a downstairs window. the silhouette of a man appears bathed in the blue glow of a computer screen. he draws the curtains once again and disappears.}
