<A>__{mank is slowly sharpening a series of pencils with a pocket knife, blank pads waiting. welles is standing across the room from him.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{so, who is he? we have to know him.}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{everyone sees someone different. that's what we show.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{like a jewel. turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated.}
<A>__{mank finishes sharpening his last pencil and picks up a pad he smiles to welles}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{go}
<A>__{and we leap into montage welles and mank brainstorm a rush of jazzy. gene krupa percussion as welles and mank develop their story. we see images of feverish creativity. welles raging, pleading, arguing, pushing. mank responding, laughing, drinking, writing. it is a passionate dance of creation welles' tennis court mank and welles are on the tennis court, but hard at work. mank waits for welles to serve. welles bounces the tennis ball, but is too preoccupied to serve as:}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{the key the key the clue what does this man recall on his death bed? okay, mank, you're dying. what's the last image that comes to you? right now.}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{this girl on a dock. white dress. never said a word to her.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{why her?}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{she was . . . innocent}
<A>__{a beat, welles deep in thought. mank watches welles closely.}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{so when was our man innocent? was there a moment early on of innocence and bliss? there must have been. okay, you're dying what do you think?}
<A>__{welles does not answer. he continues to bounce the tennis ball, deep in thought. a beat}
<C>__{mank}
<P>__{(probing)}
<D>__{something you lost maybe?}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{something you can never get back?}
<A>__{mank watches as welles lets the tennis ball drop. it bounces and rolls for a fleeting moment in welles' mind it seems to become the rolling snow globe from kane we hear the sound of sleigh bells and a child's happy voice in the snow globe we seem to see a boy laughing and pelting his father with snowballs. . . then more images, mad and outlandish and sedate and solemn; in the kitchen, in a car, around the pool, in a bar. welles and mank act out scenes and argue. they leap from character to character fearlessly. emoting and laughing and writing. we see the twin joy and terror of walking the tightrope, of sheer creation. we see them having a ferocious argument. they scream back and forth angrily and then mank storms out and slams the door. welles stands alone in his living room, he catches a glimpse of his own reflection in a mirror and we hear:}
<C>__{mank's voice}
<D>__{men like hearst don't love..}
<A>__{welles' living room: welles is slowly advancing on mank. mank sits, watching welles approach. the living room is now filthy. papers and sketches and gin bottles are discarded everywhere around them, a thick cloud of cigar smoke. it is very late at night and the room is in semi darkness.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{all men love. but men like hearst they don't bother with convention because }
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{they don't have to.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{he loves in his own way. on his conditions. because those are the only conditions he has ever known.}
<A>__{welles is now standing over mank, a dark figure in silhouette. mank soaks in this somewhat ominous image. more music and images: eating and working; swimming and working; playing and working simultaneously. then: beach: sunset. we see them walking along a deserted beach welles is walking in the surf, his trousers rolled.}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{hearst looks down at the world at his feet everything has always been beneath him.}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{and what does he see?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{the people. when they pay him homage, he adores them. but when they have the ... audacity to question him. to doubt him. to embarrass him. then he despises them.}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{and when he looks up? what does he dream about?}
