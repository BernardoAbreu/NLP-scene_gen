<L>__{interior childress's garage night}
<A>__{dave's sanctuary. at the end of a gravel driveway, behind a darkened house. garage door open. childress chain smokes and drinks beer as he leans against the dented fender of his '66 lincoln continental. trevor nurses a diet coke...}
<C>__{childress}
<D>__{... i had the same situation 'round the time of that 'night stalker' thing. remember that? whole city was scared shitless. my wife was convinced the frickin' mailman was the 'stalker' for about a week there.}
<P>__{(a tubercular chuckle)}
<D>__{some mental giant in my 4th period starts this rumor, see. childress is the 'night stalker.' right?}
<P>__{(chug a lugs)}
<D>__{... idiots. even after they caught that ramirez jerk, i'd still hear those fucks '... they got the wrong guy. childress is the stalker, ese.'}
<A>__{he finishes beer. crumples it. trevor studies him, without expression. now he notices something stapled to the tar paper wall... trevor's pov of the "certificate of excellence in teaching," yellowed and dogeared, hanging obliquely by one staple. ... as childress opens another beer.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(excusing himself)}
<D>__{i better get goin'. thanks for the soda.}
<C>__{childress}
<D>__{wait, wait. hold your horses. just hold on...}
<A>__{... finding a key in a drawer.}
<C>__{childress}
<P>__{(a twisted grin)}
<D>__{... can't leave without meetin' the kids.}
<A>__{childress unlocks a particle board cabinet against the garage wall. a watery glint in his bloodshot eyes. cabinet door swings wide now, revealing a mini arsenal of handguns...}
<C>__{childress}
<D>__{ta dah... huh?}
<A>__{trevor's eyes remain expressionless. childress rhapsodizes as he removes and handles some of the guns...}
<C>__{childress}
<D>__{... this one's from czechoslovakia. it's a c z .22 automatic. ten round clip. glow in the dark sights.}
<P>__{(eyeing the sights)}
<D>__{ain't that a beauty?}
<P>__{(next)}
<D>__{... then we gotta custom smitty, 9 'milli.' with extended grip. these smith & wessons kick like a mutha.}
<P>__{(and next)}
<D>__{now this one's special. a glock 21. lightest gun in the world. the barrel and firing pin are metal. see. everything else on it's plastic.}
<P>__{(handing it to trevor)}
<D>__{here, feel that.}
<A>__{trevor takes it, reluctantly weighs it in the palm of his hand. sets it down. now childress removes a gun from a holster in the small of his back, under his windbreaker...}
<C>__{childress}
<D>__{... 'course you can never be too prepared. my pukey lil' davis .380.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(a severe squint)}
<D>__{you wear that thing at school?}
<C>__{childress}
<P>__{(a smirk)}
<D>__{... don't worry. they never use metal detectors on teachers.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i also keep a .357 inside my desk.}
<C>__{childress }
<P>__{(a wry grin)}
<D>__{... but you already know that. didn't think i was payin' attention, did'ja? shoulda seen the look on your face.}
<A>__{pretending now. aiming the .380 at an imaginary student...}
<C>__{childress}
<D>__{now, jose, if i've told you once i've told you a hundred times, stay in your cotton pickin' seat.}
<P>__{(aiming gun)}
<D>__{boom!}
<A>__{childress laughs and chokes on his cigarette. now he gazes at the .380 in his hand. lost in a stupid, recalcitrant grin...}
<C>__{childress}
<D>__{haven't you ever just wanted to blow one of these little bastards away?}
<A>__{childress glances up into trevor's unflinching gaze. smiles to himself now. thinks he's funny...}
<C>__{childress}
<P>__{(digressing)}
<D>__{... speaking of blowing, you ever wanna fuck a high school girl, garfield?}
<P>__{(off no response)}
<D>__{'caught yer girl, rita, bustin' a train out in the 'utility' shed couple months back. swear to god. she had at least five or six cholos lined up back there.}
<P>__{(as trevor's eyes narrow)}
<D>__{face it, brother, she's a slut. c'mon, i know you had 'er.}
<P>__{(bragging now)}
<D>__{i even did her.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{you're drunk.}
<C>__{childress}
<D>__{i know you been laughin' at me behind my back.}
<C>__{childress }
<D>__{i'm talkin' about screwin' high school broads and you're givin' off this self righteous attitude like your shit don't stink.}
<A>__{childress rolls back on his heels.}
<C>__{childress}
<D>__{... tell me the truth now, garfield. did yuh do it? c'mon, i won't tell. did yuh whack benny? whadda 'bout cesar? that was generous, only taking his finger. i woulda cut off his balls.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... go to hell, dave.}
<A>__{all traces of a smile fade from dave's face. trevor just stands there. doesn't say a damn word. childress makes his own momentous conclusion.}
<C>__{childress}
<P>__{(almost exulted)}
<D>__{you really did it. you son of a bitch.}
<A>__{awkward glint of admiration in childress's eye. leans forward, hangs a hand on trevor's shoulder.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{you probably think you and me are alike.}
<A>__{trevor turns and exits the garage. pulling back from childress's dull anesthetized gaze. deep down inside childress knows he's a pathetic piece of shit...}
