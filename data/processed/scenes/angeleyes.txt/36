<L>__{exterior sharon's apartment evening}
<A>__{sharon is climbing the outdoor staircase to her apartment, tired after her shift, drained a bit by her visit home. when she reaches her door she sees that a long stemmed rose has been masking taped to her door. written on the masking tape is: "catch lambert" and a phone number. she pauses, staring at this, gets a little grin.}
<L>__{interior sharon's bedroom night (hours later)}
<A>__{sharon is dressed for bed in a sleep shirt, lying on the bed, surrounded by old photos and a couple of photo albums from her girlhood. in a vase on her bed table is catch's rose. sharon is feeling blue, looking at her young self within the family that has shut her out. she closes the book, angry at herself for nearly crying. she sits up and catches sight of the rose and rummages in the drawer and pulls out the tape with catch's phone number on it. she's very conflicted about this. she puts the tape down, but it sticks to her fingers. she tears it off and tries to throw it onto the table, but it hangsoff her thumb. she sighs and steels herself and dialsthe number.}
