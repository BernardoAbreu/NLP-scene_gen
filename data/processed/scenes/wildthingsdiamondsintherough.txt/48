<A>__{jay takes a seat on an uncomfortable metal chair in front of bullet proof glass. he's half the man he used to be, broken, trembling, smoking like a chimney. his mind's still a steel trap, just one that's rusted shut. he picks up the two way phone...}

<D>__{mr. clifford, this is kristen richards, elena sandoval's probation officer.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{she want to pin me for some more crimes?}

<D>__{you've noticed some inconsistencies?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{here's one big fucking glaring inconsistency for you: i was set up!}

<D>__{but elena's testimony was damning. why wouldn't she play ball?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what is this, the spanish inquisition? how the fuck should i know? manipulative little skank probably figured she could bleed me for some more money down the road. but i will tell you this much, i'm gonna get those diamonds back, make her wish she was never born.}
