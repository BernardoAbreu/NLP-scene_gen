<L>__{interior superintendent's mansion day}
<A>__{claude fills wilkins' water glass as the superintendent takes a bite of lamb chop and winces in pain.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{damn dentures slipping again. everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, claude? time sure marches on.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{yes, boss.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{you know, i'm fixing on retiring at the end of the summer, gonna try to enjoy what few years i have left. what do you think of this place? it's one of those new retirement communities down on the gulf.}
<A>__{claude glances at a glossy brochure. from outside, ray peers suspiciously through the dining room window as he hacks at a rose bush.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{ocean views, palm trees, two heated swimming pools and a golf course sounds a damn sight better than that infirmary across the way where i'm gonna end up.}
<A>__{claude returns the brochure.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{i apologize, claude. that was rude of me.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{that's alright, boss. takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{you been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{over forty years now. me and ray gibson out there.}
<A>__{wilkins glances over at the window. ray ducks out of view.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{forty years. that's a long time for any crime, even murder.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{it's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. don't you think that's kinda funny?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you have to forgive me if i don't laugh.}
<A>__{claude pushes back into the kitchen, leaving wilkins to think this one over.}
