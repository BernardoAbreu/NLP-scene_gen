<L>__{interior small church morning}
<A>__{dwight and caroline are being married. caroline wears a pale blue suit, and dwight looks good in a navy single breasted. aside from toby and dwight's children, the only guests are marian, kathy, and three people we haven't seen before friends of dwight's.}
<L>__{interior dwight and caroline's bedroom late night}
<A>__{the bed is a rat's nest of twisted sheets as dwight and caroline make love. he takes his lips away from caroline's breast and moves so that his head is at the bottom of the bed. holding her foot up, he kisses the instep, then runs his tongue over the same spot and then down under the arch of her foot. a sexy scene.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{m m m. there's not a straight line on you everything's curved.}
<A>__{caroline draws him up to her, and they kiss. then dwight turns caroline on her side, away from him, pre paring to enter her. caroline makes a small sound of protest, turning back toward him.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{oh, dwight, not like that. not this time not tonight.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{it's good this way.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{but i want to see your face while we make love.}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(uncomfortable laugh)}
<D>__{oh, no i just don't... uh... like that way.}
<A>__{dwight continues to stroke caroline, his hands everywhere, but now she is unresponsive.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you mean you don't like to make love face to face?}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(same laugh)}
<D>__{no, i don't like it. i can't handle it i don't like to see the face.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you mean ever?}
<A>__{dwight murmurs an assent. caroline is appalled.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{but that's grotesque...}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(stung; flares up)}
<D>__{look, you can get it doggie style or you can get it laying on your side those are your only choices. this is my house, and i get to say. wherever mcginty sits is the head of the table, you know?}
<A>__{disgusted, caroline turns back away from dwight. he shifts down on the bed a few inches, again preparing to enter her.}
