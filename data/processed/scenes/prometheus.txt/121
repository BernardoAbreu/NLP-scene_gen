<A>__{watts steers the rover recklessly, hands locked on the controls. rifle slung over her shoulder.}
<L>__{interior magellan bridge dusk}
<A>__{janek watches the rover come and the holloway alien boneless and white unfolds itself from the instruments over his head. its goblin shark jaw juts out. sinks its horrific teeth into janek's right shoulder. janek howls in agony. his right arm is paralyzed by the bite. he gropes at the pistol on his right hip with his left hand. the alien shakes him like a terrier killing a rat. janek gets the pistol. flips it in his hand. fires over his shoulder. two, three rounds... the bullets punch easily into the alien but the soft flesh closes easily over the wounds, sealing its white skin. its teeth tighten. watts comes out of nowhere in her space suit. swings a heavy rifle like a bat with all her strength. a crushing impact wrenches the alien's jaws loose. it recoils. watts reverses the rifle. pulls the trigger. a fusillade of bullets shreds the alien's head. it collapses, dead. watts wrenches her helmet off. rips a first aid kit from the bulkhead and helps janek to stanch the bleeding of his horrific wound. she gets the bleeding stopped. wraps him in bandages. janek will live but his right arm is useless.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he looks at the body of the dead alien, which is sinking into the deck plates as acid eats away at the metal.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{the juggernaut's lifting. there's a living engineer on board. he's taking the ship to earth.}
<A>__{janek blinks at her. uncomprehending.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{the others...?}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{dead. all dead. janek. we have to stop that ship.}
<A>__{janek stares out the bridge window at the hulking juggernaut in its column of light. the nightfall storm front is rolling in, a tidal wave of darkness on the horizon. a swelling rumble.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{we're not a gunship.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{we have to do something. that ship is genocide if it gets to earth...}
<A>__{janek stares at her. makes his decision. struggles to stand.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{get your helmet on.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{what about you?}
<A>__{he shakes his head. no. watts helps him across the bridge. props him up in the captain's seat.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{you'll have to be my hands.}
<P>__{(stares out at the storm)}
<D>__{you're sure about this.}
<A>__{watts nods grimly. desperate.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{he reaches out with his left hand. flips switches. the ship shudders, awakening.}
<C>__{janek }
<D>__{red lever. landing engines main.}
