<A>__{angle on slack plainclothes cop, across the street in the chevy, amazed, watching railly spray painting. he shakes his head wearily. anglz on street types, inching closer, watching railly with amazement, too. they include... an irish drunk, white haired, red faced, bloated... a native american with tormented eyes and a mangled ear... an african american with one eye... the teenaged punks... a white man, shabbily dressed, joining the knot of onlookers, reacting at the sight of railly. it's cole! he pushes toward her.}

<D>__{james put your hands down and listen to me. things have changed!}
<A>__{angle on the plainclothes cop, checking the mug shot of cole on his clipboard, then reaching for his radio mike. angle on railly, reacting to the cop speaking into his mike: she tosses the spray paint can aside, grabs cole and tries to pull him along...but cole isn't moving. he's staring at the front of the faa store with disbelief!}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{james, come on! we have to get out of here!}
<A>__{cole looks from the wall to the can rolling on the sidewalk, then back to the wall where railly has sprayed the huge words:}
<D>__{attention!!! police are watching! is there a virus? is this the source? three billion die?}
<A>__{it's the graffiti cole saw in the future, in the picture!}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i've seen that...before.}
<A>__{but railly's total attention is on their dilemma.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{james, trust me. we're in terrible trouble. we have to run.}
<A>__{very confused, cole lets her drag him along the sidewalk, past onlookers. she looks crazier than he does. angle on the chevy, making a sudden, urgent u turn, almost colliding with a passing car. brakes squeal and a horn blares.}
