<C>__{genco}
<P>__{(enthusiastically)}
<D>__{god bless america! we're in business!}

<A>__{willy cicci, pentangeli's associate and bodyguard takes a drink of water.}
<C>__{senator }
<D>__{mr. cicci. from the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the "genco olive oil company."}
<C>__{cicci}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{senator }
<D>__{but in actuality, you were a member of the corleone crime organization.}
<C>__{cicci}
<D>__{the corleone family, senator. we called it, "the family."}
<C>__{senator }
<D>__{what position did you occupy?}
<C>__{cicci}

<B>__{view on senator kane}
<A>__{a thin, angular baptist with a mid western accent.}

<D>__{when the boss says push the button on a guy, i push the button, see, senator?}
<A>__{the senators treat cicci with a surface courtesy, as if he were a curious kind of animal, not really human. cicci reacts to this by being even more brutally forthright than he has to be, to show his contempt for what he considers a hypocrisy. the view alters from senator kane to the committee's attorney, mr. questadt.}
