<C>__{big johnson}
<P>__{(ignoring robinson, to the engineer)}
<D>__{we must shut down the building. go wider !}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{i need authorization }
<C>__{big johnson}
<D>__{authorization? how about the united states fucking government? lose the grid or lose your job!}

<C>__{big johnson}
<D>__{that should shake'em up. with all the power shut down, those bastards are probably scared shitless.}
<B>__{in the vault room}
<A>__{the safe door finishes its ponderous move, clunks to a halt. theo and kristoff laugh, give each other high fives. even hans loses his usual cool, slaps theo on the back as theo and kristoff cheer.}
