<L>__{interior cafe lalo continuous}
<A>__{kathleen, sitting alone, at a table for two, is drinking her tea. she's starting to feel a little foolish. she checks her watch. a loud, boisterous group comes in and sits at the table next to hers. they're laughing. a man from the group grabs the empty chair at kathleen's table.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{do you mind?}
<A>__{kathleen jumps up.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{oh, yes. i'm expecting someone. please.}
<A>__{she takes the chair back. sits down again. she watches the group as they playfully fight over the menus. she checks her watch again. then she opens her copy of pride and prejudice and looks at it. she can't focus. a man comes into the restaurant and she looks up hopefully at him. but he's going to meet another group of people. as he passes her table, he knocks the book and the flower onto the floor.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{she jumps up and rescues the book and flower as if they were precious china. in the window, now, behind her, joe appears. he watches, as she rearranges the book and the flower. he disappears from sight. a beat... he walks in the door.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{kathleen kelly. hello. what a coincidence. mind if i sit down?}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{yes i do. i'm expecting someone.}
<A>__{joe picks up her book, looks at it.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{pride and prejudice.}
<A>__{kathleen grabs it back.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{do you mind?}
<A>__{she places it back on the table, puts the rose into it.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i didn't know you were a jane austen fan. not that it's a surprise. i bet you read it every year. i bet you just love mr. darcy, and that your sentimental heart beats wildly at the thought that he and whatever her name is are really, honestly and truly going to end up together.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{would you please leave?}
<A>__{joe sits down.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{please?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i will get up as soon as your friend comes. is he late?}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{the heroine of pride and prejudice is elizabeth bennet and she's one of the greatest, most complex characters ever written, not that you would know.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{as a matter of fact i've read it.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{well, good for you.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i think you'd discover a lot of things if you really knew me.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{if i really knew you, i know what i would find instead of a brain, a cash register, instead of a heart, a bottom line.}
<A>__{kathleen is shocked at herself.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{i just had a breakthrough, and i have to thank you for it. for the first time in my life, when confronted with a horrible, insensitive person i actually knew what i wanted to say and i said it.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i think you have a gift for it. it was a splendid mixture of poetry and meanness.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{meanness? let me tell you }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{don't misunderstand me, i'm just paying you a compliment.}
<A>__{he lifts the book off the table. kathleen grabs for it.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<A>__{she manages to get the book, leaving joe with the rose.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what have we have? a red, no, crimson rose, tucked into the pages. something you read about in a book, no doubt. one of those books with a lady in a nightgown on the cover about to throw herself off a cliff.}
<A>__{she holds her hand out for it.}
<C>__{kathleen }
<D>__{give it to me.}
<A>__{joe puts it between his mouth and his nose like a mustache.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it's a joke to you, isn't it? everything's a joke to you.}
<A>__{she grabs the rose. puts it back in the book.}
<C>__{kathleen }
<D>__{please leave. i beg you.}
<A>__{he stands up, walks from the table, sits down at the very next table, with his back to her. the door to the restaurant opens. kathleen looks at it hopefully. a pleasant looking man, who's immediately joined by a pleasant looking woman. for a moment, kathleen looks just a little droopy, as if the wind has just gone out of her sails. she takes out her compact, looks into her mirror. she slides it over to look behind her, at him, just as he's looking sideways at her. he turns away suddenly. then she blots her lipstick with her handkerchief.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you know what the handkerchief reminds me of? the first day i met you }
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{the first day you lied to me }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i didn't lie to you }
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{you did too }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i did not }
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{i thought all that fox stuff was so charming. f o x.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i never lied about it }
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{"joe. just call me joe." as if you were one of those stupid 22 year old girls with no last name. "hi, i'm kimberley." "hi, i'm janice." what's wrong with them? don't they know you're supposed to have last names? it's like they're a whole generation of cocktail waitresses.}
<A>__{she stops herself it's a tangent she never meant to go off on. but joe has stood up and seated himself back at her table.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i am not a stupid 22 year old girl }
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{that's not what i meant }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{and when i said the thing about the price club and cans of olive oil, that wasn't what i meant either }
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{oh, you poor sad multimillionaire. i feel so sorry for you.}
<A>__{the door opens and a large and very attractive transvestite in a boa comes in the door.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i am going to take a wild guess that this isn't him, either. who is he, i wonder. not, i gather, the world's greatest living expert on julius and ethel rosenberg, but someone else entirely. will you be you be mean to him too? will you start out sweet as sugar candy and then suddenly, miraculously, like a bolt from the blue, find that sharp little tongue of yours?}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{no, i won't. because the man who's coming here tonight is completely unlike you. the man who is coming here is kind and funny he has the most wonderful sense of humor }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{but he's not here.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{if he's not here, he has a reason, because there is not a cruel or careless bone in his body. i can't expect you to know anything about a person like that. you've nothing but a suit.}
<A>__{a beat. joe gets up.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{that is my cue. good night.}
<A>__{joe leaves.}
