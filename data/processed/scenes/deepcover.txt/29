<L>__{interior carver's office night}
<A>__{(note: hull invariably meets carver in this anonymous room, distinguished only by the green blotter and a view of the city. this simple regularity suggest visits to a psychiatrist, carver probing, testing, teasing, trying to draw hull out. and they feel like therapy, at once a respite and a torment.) more foil balls on the blotter beside boxes of 3x5 photographs. photos of eddie and david elias are up on a corkboard, the beginning of a pyramid.}

<D>__{eddie something... a motormouth... he supplies the street dealers... buys from him...}
<P>__{(reads name on back of photo)}
<D>__{david elias... who apparently buys from a guy named barbolla or something. but i haven't seen him.}
<A>__{carver produces a photo of a handsome latin in his 50s, pins it on the board above elias.}

<D>__{barbosa, felix.}

<D>__{there was also a woman, but she's not here.}
<P>__{(as carver reaches in a drawer)}
<D>__{i saw a kid killed. twelve, thirteen at the most. turf war.}
<A>__{carver shrugs: these things happen. he hands hull a lot of cash, much more than expected. hull does understand.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{get to elias. then to barbosa.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{you can't rush this stuff.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{rush it, please. i want art, john, not reality. budget hearings start in april, and i need gallegos by then. they won't give us funding for three ounce buys.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{we're not just doing this for the funding, are we?}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{without funding, we aren't doing it at all.}
