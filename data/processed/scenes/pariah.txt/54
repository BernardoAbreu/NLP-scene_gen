<L>__{interior laura's living room evening}
<A>__{laura and a group of friends play a rowdy game of spades. a cute puerto rican girl is draped around laura's neck like a personal cheerleader. music blasts from the tv but doesn't drown out the hoots and banter of the rollicking entourage. there is a knock at the door.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you'll get that for me?}
<A>__{one of the friends breaks away from the pack, opens the door without greeting and walks away. alike is left alone to escort herself in. laura hardly looks up as alike stops at the fringes of the pack.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{wassup man.}
<A>__{a collective grumble of greeting goes up around the table although no one addresses alike directly. laura slams the table and raises her hands in triumph.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{board, goddammit!! i told you! pier girl #1 awww, we shoulda been done set you!}
<A>__{laura slaps hands with her partner. the unlucky pair of partners argue. the personal cheerleader kisses laura on the neck. alike looks away.}

<C>__{alike}
<D>__{i really need to talk to you }
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i said later!}
<A>__{wide eyed silence and scattered snickers around the table. laura resumes her hand and the game banter cranks back up. alike picks up her face and slips away.}
<D>__{pier girl #3 thought that was your girl?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{mind your business. bam! that's what i thought!}
<A>__{laura slaps another card on the table and takes a deep swig of water.}
