<L>__{exterior rooftop}
<A>__{gutterbuhg arrives at the top. he looks around. there is no sign of indy. but the fuse rests at the roof's edge. unlit. gutterbuhg restarts the fuse. at that moment, indiana leaps out from inside of the stone smokestack. he jumps the unsuspecting gutterbuhg. they tumble and fall off the rooftop edge. indiana and gutterbuhg hit the ground. they continue to struggle... fight...as the fuse burns in front of them. it speeds toward the pile of dynamite. less than fifty feet ahead. still wrestling with gutterbuhg, indy rolls toward the fuse. indy reaches out and stops the fuse with his hand. but gutterbuhg moves fast. again, the nazi relights the fuse. indy suddenly leaps to his feet. he runs off screen. gutterbuhg follows. the fuse continues to burn. moving closer...closer...to the dynamite. indiana runs to a cluster of trees. he comes to an abrupt stop, between two trees. gutterbuhg is upon him. the nazi pauses. only a few feet from indy. gutterbuhg points his arm at indy. a clear shot. gutterbuhg smiles. indiana is trapped. the fuse is now only a few feet from the dynamite. it will blow at any second! gutterbuhg shoots. moving like lightning, indy leaps out of the way, revealing a large lake behind him. it's too late for gutterbubg. the electrical current hits the water. the nazi's body surges with electricity. gutterbuhg fries. he shivers. shakes. frozen, as the powerful electrical current flows through his veins. smoke billows from his body. his mechanical arm suddenly explodes. gutterbuhg's charred body falls. face down. electrocuted. indiana leaps to his feet. suddenly remembering... the fuse! it is now inches from the t.n.t. indy can't get to it in time. he grabs his whip. his arm snaps forward. the whip cracks. it slices the remaining fuse in two. the fuse fizzles and goes out. the city is saved. indy sighs. there is a gunshot! a bullet whizzes by indy's head. he turns. mephisto, bruised and bloodied from the jeep accident, stands several feet away. mephisto's luger is aimed at indy. prepared to take another shot. indy removes his revolver. he fires at mephisto. the nazi dashes into the coliseum. indiana follows.}
