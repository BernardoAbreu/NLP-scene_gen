<L>__{16 wider angle}
<A>__{the lineman, kneeling at his tool chest, is surprised by cameron. the other lineman is halfway up the power pole. they both stare at cameron's handcuffs. cameron edges back, his escape route blocked. the man on the ground grabs a wrench and moves forward with the same gleam in his eye we saw when he scared that bird from the tree.}
<C>__{lineman}
<D>__{stand right there like a good old boy and do what i say. you wanna try and mess with me, you've had fair warning. i was a combat marine in korea. okay?}
<A>__{the lineman advances on him as cameron backs away.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{korea? no shit, so was my old man...}
<P>__{(he suddenly stamps his foot and shrieks)}
<D>__{aaaaaaaargh!}
<A>__{the lineman jumps in surprise. then, enraged like a startled bull, he lunges forward with the wrench. cameron uses the man's weight against him, his moves those of a trained fighter. a hard knee to his stomach doubles up the lineman. the handcuffed arms slam down like a club between his shoulder blades driving him to the ground. a kick thrown sideways to his head and the man is out. the other lineman who had started to descend the pole freezes and takes one step back up. cameron grabs the lineman's toolbox in his handcuffed grasp and dashes off into the forest.}
