<A>__{shouting french to the bartender. folks who look like jim brown, schulberg mailer types...hang out, half drunk...and argue about flights out with extortionate petty bureaucrats like zairian official #2. flights have been cancelled, tickets rendered no good, passports confiscated, etc. there's a stoned hunter thompson bill cardoso type with a couple of zairian hookers. the hunter thompson type is not very discreetly smoking congolese weed. reveal: in the back corner of the bar are... don king + herbert muhammad. king is importuning herbert, his hands work the air, gesticulating madly, building whole castles of hype and hustle. we can't hear what he's saying. herbert listens. then don king stops and looks at him, and herbert nods his head "yes." then herbert starts saying something and don king nods his head "yes." whatever's happening here, a deal for the future has been struck.}
