<L>__{exterior roof day}
<A>__{david pushes the roof door shut, barricades it with some concrete blocks sitting on the roof. rain pours down on them. they rush to the edge of the roof. three con edison vans are parked haphazardly on the street below. and a dozen civilians on the sidewalk are frozen... david grabs elise and they go to the side of the roof, the roof of the building next door is ten feet below them. they hang their legs over the edge and jump. they sprint across the roof of the building next door except somehow they find themselves running across the same roof they were just on. david sees the concrete blocks he placed against the door a moment ago. the door bangs against theme being shoved open from inside. david and elise run back in the opposite direction. at the building's edge they climb over again and... run... only to find that they are still on the first roof they were on. it's like they're in an.escher painting. they stop, and look at each other. david takes her hand as adjustment team troopers appear all around them from adjacent roofs. they're completely surrounded.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{kiss me.}
<A>__{tears well in her eyes. and his.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{close your eyes and kiss me.}
<A>__{he does. and they kiss in the rain...}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{i love you, david norris.}
<A>__{they hold each other for a long beat ... and then, finally, open their eyes.. ready to accept their fate they see an empty roof. the silver suits are gone. and the rain has stopped. a strange silence envelopes them... they spin the other direction to see the chairman, standing there, alone.}
<C>__{the chairman}
<D>__{hello, david... good morning, elise.}
<A>__{his voice is gentle, paternal.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{the chairman}
<D>__{i think you know.}
<A>__{david and elise stand in awe as they realize.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you can't outrun fate...}
<C>__{the chairman}
<D>__{it's more complicated than that, fate am free will coexist they're in tension with each other. and pure chance.}
<A>__{a beat. david looks back at him...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{the chairman}
<D>__{i could control everything. you'd be happy but you'd be puppets. i try to keep things from getting too out of control. but that has a cost. most people go through life like pinballs, reacting predictably to the stimuli i apply. they accept the path they find themselves on. and perform accordingly. but every once in a while someone comes along who refuses to be bound by his fate, someone who understands that free will is a gift most people are too afraid to use.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{which, you see, is partly the point of all this.}
<C>__{the chairman }
<D>__{or maybe you don't see it. maybe you just feel it. and that's even better. because that's the other part.}
<A>__{david and elise take it in...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and all the misery, all the pain...}
<C>__{the chairman}
<D>__{i sit up there and i watch it and it hurts me... but if you could see the incredible courage people show, the random acts of kindness, the love... if you could see human beings choosing every moment every day to be better than i made them, you would know it's all worthwhile.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{good luck, david. and good luck to you, elise. you're a beautiful dancer. and so much more...}
<A>__{the chairman turns to his aide, who we didn't know was there.}
<C>__{the chairman}
<D>__{their case is closed.}
<C>__{aide to the chairrman}
<D>__{but, sir, isn't this a major. deviation from the plan?}
<A>__{the chairmen turns to another aide who is holding a folio open and signs a document on very heavy paper.}
<C>__{the chairman}
<D>__{not anymore .}
<A>__{david and elise watch the chairman walk away, still awed by what=they've just experienced. as he disappears around a corner, the sun comes out from behind the clouds ... after a long beat, elise turns back to david, as if to say "what do we do now?"}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{maybe we should go dancing.}
<A>__{a smile slowly spreads across her face ...}
<C>__{the end}
