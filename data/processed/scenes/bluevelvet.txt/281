<L>__{190. interior party basement night}
<A>__{jeffrey and sandy go downstairs to a basement which is dark and crowded with kids dancing and talking. jeffrey and sandy are holding hands. jeffrey feels a little out of place. a couple of girls raise their eyebrows and give approving looks to sandy. the music is loud, fast dancing music.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{you want to dance?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{i can't dance fast.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{really. you want to dance with someone else?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{let's wait for some slow one.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{just a minute.}
<A>__{sandy leaves jeffrey for a moment and jeffrey watches her make her way through the crowd to a girl by the record player. sandy confers with the girl. sandy comes back to jeffrey.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{don't worry. i took care of it. you want something to drink?}
<A>__{just then, the music goes slow.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{you want to dance?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{they begin to dance. at first, further apart, then, they make the mistake of looking in each other's eyes and they move very close together. they move around to another look. then they kiss. they kiss for the entire rest of the song. between songs and during the entire next song. they finally, as they say, come up for air.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{i love you, jeffrey.}
<A>__{they kiss again. then they dance and look at each other. then they hug each other. as they hug, jeffrey closes his eyes.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{i really do love you.}
