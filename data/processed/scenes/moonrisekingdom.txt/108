<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{split screen. on one side of the frame, we see captain sharp, scout master ward, and becky. on the other side, we see a fifty year old woman in a blue and white uniform pants suit with a salvation army officer style hat and a red ribbon tied in a bow around her neck. she is social services. she sits at a desk in a cinder block office. guards and orderlies criss cross in a bullet proof window to a long, grey corridor behind her.}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<D>__{hello? this is captain sharp.}
<A>__{social services flips open a file folder and picks up a ball point pen. (she takes notes throughout the conversation.) she says into her telephone:}
<C>__{social services}
<D>__{hello, captain sharp. this is social services. i'm calling in reference to sam shakusky, ward of the state. i understand he's in your custody.}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<D>__{that's correct.}
<C>__{social services}
<D>__{what's his condition? has he suffered any injury or trauma of any kind?}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<D>__{he's ok.}
<C>__{social services}
<D>__{very good. how do i get to you?}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<D>__{the fastest way is by seaplane. jed can bring you in with the mail.}
<C>__{social services}
<D>__{i will come tomorrow morning, if that's acceptable to you. is someone able to}
<C>__{social services }
<D>__{provide reasonable care and nourishment for the boy until that time?}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{social services}
<D>__{is that a yes?}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{social services}
<D>__{very good. i will contact you again before the end of the day.}
<A>__{social services starts to hang up the telephone. captain sharp says abruptly:}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<D>__{wait a second.}
<C>__{social services}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<D>__{social services?}
<C>__{social services}
<P>__{(evenly)}
<D>__{captain sharp.}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<P>__{(anxious)}
<D>__{what's going to happen to him?}
<A>__{pause. social services puts down her pen. she clasps her hands together in front of her. she says finally:}
<C>__{social services}
<D>__{well, normally, we'd try to place him in another foster home, but that option is no longer available to us, in my opinion, with his case history which means he'll go to juvenile refuge.}
<A>__{captain sharp exchanges a look with scout master ward. scout master ward interjects:}
<C>__{scout master ward}
<D>__{what's that? an orphanage?}
<A>__{social services frowns. she asks calmly:}
<C>__{social services}
<D>__{who's speaking?}
<C>__{scout master ward}
<D>__{this is scout master ward.}
<A>__{social services refers to a document in her file folder. she nods.}
<C>__{social services}
<D>__{right. an orphanage but the first step is the admissions panel requires a psychological evaluation to determine whether or not the boy's a candidate for institutional treatment or electroshock therapy. beyond that }
<C>__{captain sharp}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{excuse me. shock therapy? why would that be necessary? he's not violent.}
<A>__{social services picks up the document. she points to it.}
<C>__{social services}
<D>__{the report describes an assault with scissors.}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<P>__{(objecting)}
<D>__{that was the girl! who did that.}
<C>__{social services}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{well, maybe she needs help, too but that's not our job. ok?}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{social service hangs up the telephone. becky pulls the cords out of their sockets. scout master ward looks to captain sharp. silence. becky opens a tin of home made lemon bars. captain sharp declines one. scout master ward tries one. he looks completely enchanted.}
