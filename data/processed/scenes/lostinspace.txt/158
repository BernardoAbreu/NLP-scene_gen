<D>__{seal it. now!}
<A>__{don hits a switch just as a spider breaks free, rushing towards the dropping airlock door. smith recoils from the swiping talon. smith's back close. a tiny rand and beneath, a razor thin incision. the door drops, the spider's arm, still twitching, severed inside the airlock.}

<A>__{the inner airlock door opens. the crew tumble in.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{get us out of here.}
<A>__{don is already powering up the ship's engines as smith tries separating himself from the tiny lizard monkey.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{get this cloying gargoyle off of me.}
<A>__{he throws the beast hard across the bridge. the creature hits the wall, screeching, begins racing across consoles. john has strapped in beside don.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{get me an external view.}
<A>__{a monitor shows the hull of the jupiter two. more spiders are leaping onto the ship, attaching themselves to the hull.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{prepare to disengage.}
<A>__{the lizard monkey skitters up the back of penny's chair, over her head, getting tangled in her hair before jumping into her lap.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{get it off me. get it off.}
<A>__{penny in frantically wiping the hair from her face. the tiny creature on her lap begins a perfect imitation of penny. don releases the docking ring, glances at the monitor. the hull of the ship is now entirely covered with spiders.}

<D>__{initiating separation.}
<A>__{lizard monkey's eyes widen in terror as the ship shakes, burying its head in penny's chest. a beat. then penny hugs the tiny beast.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{it's okay. everything's going to be alright.}
<A>__{but she sounds anything but sure.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{we're clear. everybody hang on.}
