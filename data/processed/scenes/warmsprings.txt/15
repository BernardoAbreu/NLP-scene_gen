<A>__{springwood is the three story roosevelt mansion. it is surrounded by a thousand acres of forests, fields, bridal paths and a glorious view of the hudson river. the five roosevelt children are screaming on the front lawn playing a boisterous game of croquet.}

<A>__{sara roosevelt, 65, sits at the head of the table. she is one for whom the expression "grande dame" was coined. franklin is at the opposite end of the table, looking pale. louis, as always, is by his side. eleanor, like a prisoner who has accepted her fate, sits across from them, calm and composed.}

<D>__{lord save us from fools in love.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{falling in love is out of the question. why do you think men have mistresses? duty. duty to their families and their careers.}

<C>__{sara}
<D>__{where do you think you're going?}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{it's obvious that my input in this matter is of little importance.}
