<L>__{interior billy goat tavern night}
<A>__{a neighborhood bar. roper and mccall are playing pool. half finished beers are on a nearby table. mccall is bent over the table trying to make a particularly tricky shot. roper studies him.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{you got a girlfriend?}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{why? you like my ass?}
<A>__{mccall misses the shot.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{better than your pool game.}
<A>__{roper lines up his shot.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{you wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{i don't gamble.}
<A>__{roper smiles. sinks his shot. moves around the table.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{yeah, i've got a girlfriend.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{you living together?}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{she's back in jersey... going to graduate school.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{explain how that works.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{she's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{she grow up in livingtston, too?}
<C>__{mccall}
<P>__{(as if that were unthinkable)}
<D>__{no, no, no...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{she's from hoboken.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{oh, "city girl". don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in new jersey?}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{we see each other every couple of months.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{every couple of months, huh?}
<A>__{a couple of months sounds like an awful long time to roper.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{that's a lot of commitment. i admire that.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{do you really?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{no. actually i think it's fucking crazy, i don't know if i could do it.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{thanks for clearing that up.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i hear your former girlfriend is going out with greg barnett.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{where did you hear that?}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{around. barnett's tough competition.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.}
<A>__{a beat and then mccall realizes that this comment is a major acknowledgement of acceptance from roper. roper misses his shot. picks up his beer glass.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{lesson two, "dead eye"... should have been lesson one. never exchange yourself for a hostage.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{i think i can handle that one.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{yeah, you think so, but it comes up.}
<A>__{roper takes a drink of beer. nears the bottom of his glass. calls to the bartender.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{zack, another round.}
<A>__{roper turns back to mccall.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{my partner gave himself in exchange for a ten year old girl. he got caught in the crossfire. two dead. my partner and the bad guy...}
<P>__{(takes the last sip)}
<D>__{weird thing is, if he was alive, he'd probably do it again.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{some people never learn.}
<A>__{roper puts down his glass.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{you think you can learn, mccall?}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{i think so.}
<A>__{roper nods. maybe he can.}
