<A>__{the living room is also a mess the place is either a pig sty or a house full of bachelors. jerry, now in sweatpants and sneakers, but still wearing the same t shirt that he slept in, carries his suitcase through the foyer to the front door. he about faces to look at the interior of his home. he will not miss it. he turns to open the screen door it's stuck. he fiddles with handle until the screen door opens. he exits, letting the screen door slam shut behind him.}
