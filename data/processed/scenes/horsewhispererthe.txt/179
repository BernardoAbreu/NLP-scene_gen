<L>__{exterior the mountains dead of night}
<A>__{dead in stillness. the cattle dark and motionless. everyone asleep in bedrolls around the pasture. annie awakens, looks up at the moon, watching it go in and out of the clouds. she looks over to sleeping grace... then looks to where tom is and sees his sleeping bag is empty. quietly, she rises and looks for him. she starts across the grass and sees him crossing on his haunches, wearing a slicker, sitting in the grass by the stream, drinking some water. she watches him. tom senses something and turns. for a moment, they just look at each other half disbelieving the inevitable is so close at hand. annie approaches as tom rises. they meet. they kiss. tentative at first, but more, just to make that very, precious first moment of discovery last as long as it can. the kiss grows more passionate. they begin to lose themselves in each other. until, suddenly, aware of their surroundings, they part. no words. their expressions to each other tell all. annie separates herself and goes back to her bedroll... tom stands in the grass, by the stream... the moving water, the night's only sound.}
