<A>__{bill follows her. two diseased people appear, screeching and running toward them. bill shoots them both. and he makes a break for it, running as fast as he can across the street. he turns, expecting to see starla right behind him. but she has stayed behind, staring quietly at the ground. starla has tears in her eyes. she motions with her head for bill to go. bill is confused. the diseased townsfolk come up around starla from the sides of the flower store, no one paying attention to bill. they encircle her, slowly. some screech angrily at her. she's too disgusted or fearful to even look in their eyes. they breathe with sick, raspy breath.}
