<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{bonnie and clyde. they lie where they were with one difference they are now wrapped in the blanket. clyde's pants are wadded up and tangled with his shoes at the base of the blanket.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(chuckling, apparently quite pleased)}
<D>__{damn!...damn...damn!}
<A>__{he casts a sidelong glance to bonnie, wanting some sort of overt reaction from her. she's just smiling slightly. clyde's underlying anxiety begins to surface.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(not looking at her)}
<D>__{hey, listen, bonnie, how do you feel?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(watching him}
<D>__{steadily, her slight}
<P>__{smile growing)}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i mean you feel like you're s'posed to feel after you've uh...}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{just.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(doesn't know what}
<D>__{the fuck to say,}
<P>__{desperately wants her approval)}
<D>__{well, that's good, ain't it. reason i ask is, i uh... well, i figger it's a good idea to ask. i mean how else do i tell if i did it the way...}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(stopping him, with great warmth)}
<D>__{hey. you done just perfect.}
<A>__{clyde looks at her for the first time, tremendously relieved. he can see she means it. now his buoyancy, utterly, unchained breaks through:}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i did, didn't i? i mean i did, i really did. i did it, i did, i mean this was my first time and it was just like rollin' off a log when it comes right down to it, it was easy, i mean i didn't even have to try...}
<A>__{lovingly, laughing, altogether overwhelmed with himself, clyde pulls bonnie into him. he kisses her, wants to make love again, but then pulls back and keeps chattering at sixty miles a minute. he's waited twenty three years to talk about this, and he's got the perfect audience.}
