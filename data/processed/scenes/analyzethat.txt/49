<P>__{(oblivious)}
<D>__{mike, can we talk for a second?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{sure. what?}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{i know the last few weeks have been kind of tough with grandpa dying and everything and it might've felt to you like i didn't have time for you or i didn't care about how you feel.}
<C>__{michael}
<A>__{no, it didn't.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{good. because i want you to know that you can talk to me about stuff and that i can really listen and understand what you're going through.}
<C>__{michael}
<A>__{i do, dad.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{and if i seemed a little hard on grandpa, it's just that your grandfather was a hard man in a lot of ways. he wanted everything done his way and sometimes i just felt like nothing i ever did was good enough. i don't want it to be that way with us.}
<C>__{michael}
<A>__{it's not.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{and you know, at times like this we all might start questioning our own mortality and you might be thinking how devastated you'd be if i died. right?}
<C>__{michael}
<A>__{no. not really.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{that's good. good talk. and i realize it's all a little hectic right now, but this paul vitti thing is only temporary, okay?}
<C>__{michael}
<A>__{oh, really? i didn't hear you the tenth fuckin' time.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{that's not funny. good night, michael.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{good night, whippy.}
<A>__{ben exits, shaking his head. the moment he's gone, the rumpled blankets next to michael shift, and a cute, punky 16 year old girl emerges from hiding under the comforter.}
<C>__{cute girl}
<D>__{i gotta get home. what was that about?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i have no idea. parenting stuff.}
