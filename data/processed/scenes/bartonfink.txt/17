<L>__{7:45.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{...just put it out of you head...}
<B>__{tracking}
<A>__{toward a pool set in a grand yard with shaped hedges and statuary set amid palms trees. sunlight glitters angrily off the water; we are approaching jack lipnik who sits poolside in a white deck chair.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{bart! so happy to see ya!}
<B>__{reverse}
<A>__{pulling barton, who is being escorted by lou breeze. barton is haggard, sunken eyes squinting against too much sun.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{sit! talk! relax for a minute, then talk! drink?}
<A>__{as barton sits:}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{yeah... rye whiskey?}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{boy! you writers! work hard, play hard! that's what i hear, anyway...}
<A>__{he laughs, then barks at lou breeze.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{... lou.}
<A>__{lou exits.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{anyway. ben geisler tells me things're going along great. thinks we've got a real winner in this one. and let me tell you something, i'm counting on it. i've taken an interest. not to interfere, mind you hardly seems necessary in your case. a writer a storyteller of your stature. givitta me in bold strokes, bart. gimme the broad outlines. i'm sitting in the audience, the lights go down, capitol logo comes up... you're on!}
<A>__{he beams expectantly at barton. barton licks his parched lips.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{yeah, okay... well... we fade in...}
<A>__{lipnik is nodding, already involved in the story.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...it's a tenement building. on the lower east side...}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{great! he's poor, this wrestler! he's had to struggle!}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{and then... well...}
<A>__{barton looks back out at the pool, his eyes closed to slits against the sun. he looks back at lipnik.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...can i be honest, mr. lipnik?}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{can you? you damn well better be. jesus, if i hadn't been honest in my business dealings well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things if i'd been totally honest, i wouldn't be within a mile of this pool unless i was cleaning it. but that's no reason for you not to be. honest, i mean. not cleaning the pool.}
<A>__{lou has entered with a drink, which he sets next to barton. lou sits. barton looks around, takes the drink, sips at it greedily, but must finally take the plunge.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well... to be honest, i'm never really comfortable discussing a work in progress. i've got it all worked out in my head, but sometimes if you force it out in words prematurely the wrong words well, your meaning changes, and it changes your own mind, and you never get it back so i'd just as soon not talk about it.}
<A>__{lipnik stares at him. his smile has disappeared. there is a long beat. lou breeze clears his throat. he apparently feels obliged to fill the silence.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{...mr. fink. never mind me. never mind how long i've been in pictures. mr. lipnik has been in pictures just about since they were invented. he practically invented them.}
<A>__{lipnik has turned to look curiously at lou.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{...now i think if he's interested in what one of his contract employees is doing while he draws pay, i think that employee ought to tell him, if he wants to stay an employee. right now the contents of your head are the property of capitol pictures, so if i were you i would speak up. and pretty goddamn fast.}
<A>__{lou looks at barton, expectantly. lipnik continues to stare at lou. there is a long silence, terribly heavy. finally, lipnik explodes at lou.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{you lousy sonofabitch! you're telling this man this artist what to do?!}
<A>__{lou breeze is stunned.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{mr. lipnik, i}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{this man creates for a living! he puts food on your table and on mine! thank him for it! thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! thank him or you're fired!}
<A>__{barton is staring, aghast.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{mr. lipnik, that's not really necessar }
<A>__{lipnik, still staring at lou, gives no sign of hearing barton. he rises and points.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{get down on your knees, you sonofabitch! get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{mr. lipnik, please}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i mr. lipnik}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{kiss this man's feet!!}
<A>__{lou, aghast, looks at barton. barton, aghast, can only return the same stunned look. lipnik snarls at lou:}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{...okay, get out of here. you're fired, you understand me? get out of my sight.}
<A>__{lou gets stiffly to his feet and stumbles away.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{mr. lipnik, i}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{i apologize, barton.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{no no, mr. breeze has actually been a great help}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{you don't have to cover for him. it's noble of you, but these things happen in business.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{mr. lipnik, i really would feel much better if you could reconsider}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{ah, forget it, kid. i want you to pull this out of your head. if that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, i will. i respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.}
<A>__{he gets down on his knees in front of barton.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{...you know in the old country we were taught, as very young children, that there's no shame in supplicatin' yourself when you respect someone.}
<A>__{barton stares, horrified, at lipnik, on the ground at his feet.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{...on behalf of capitol pictures, the administration, and all a the stockholders, please accept this as a symbol of our apology and respect.}
<A>__{barton's pov lipnik kisses his shoe and looks up at him. behind lipnik the pool glitters. barton's room the cut has a hard musical sting. out of the sting comes a loud but distorted thumping noise. we are looking down, high angle, form one corner of the room. we are presented with a motionless tableau: barton sits, hunched, in the far corner, elbows on knees, staring at the bed in front of him. he wears only trousers and a t shirt and his body and face glisten with sweat. the bed's sheets have been stripped and the ratty gray mattress has an enormous rust red stain in the middle. after a beat, in the foreground, the only motion in the scene: a bead of tacky yellow wall sweat dribbles down the near wall. silence, then the thumping repeats, resolving itself to a knock at the door. barton rises slowly and crosses to the door.}
<B>__{the door}
<A>__{barton opens it to charlie, who is dressed in a baggy suit, his hair slicked back, a tan fedora pushed back on his head. it is the first time we have seen him well turned out. a battered briefcase is on the floor next to him. he holds a parcel in his left hand, about one foot square, wrapped in brown paper and tied up with twine.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{barton. can i come in?}
<A>__{barton stands back from the door and charlie picks up his briefcase and enters.}
<B>__{the room}
<A>__{as the two men enter.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{jesus... you're leaving.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{have to, old timer. just for a while.}
<A>__{barton sounds desperate:}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{jesus, charlie, i...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{everything's okay, believe me. i know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{charlie! i've got no one else here! you're the only person i know in los angeles...}
<A>__{he starts weeping}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...that i can talk to.}
<A>__{charlie, also disturbed and unhappy, wraps both arms around barton. barton sobs unashamedly into his shoulder. charlie is somber.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's okay... it's okay...}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{charlie, i feel like i'm going crazy like i'm losing my mind. i don't know what to do... i didn't do it, believe me. i'm sure of that, charlie. i just...}
<A>__{his breath comes in short gasping heaves.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...i just don't know what... to do}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you gotta get a grip on, brother. you gotta just carry on just for a few days, till i get back. try and stay here, keep your door locked. don't talk to anyone. we just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{yeah, but charlie}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{dammit, don't argue with me. you asked me to believe you well i do. now don't argue with me.}
<A>__{he looks at barton for a beat.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...look, pal can you do something for me?}
<A>__{charlie hands him his parcel.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...keep this for me, till i get back.}
<A>__{barton, snuffling, accepts the package.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...it's just personal stuff. i don't wanna drag it with me, but i don't trust 'em downstairs, and i'd like to think it's in good hands.}
<A>__{still snuffling:}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{sure, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime when he can fit it into a little box like that. i guess... i guess it's kind of pathetic.}
<A>__{wallowing in self pity:}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{it's more than i've got.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, keep it for me. maybe it'll bring you good luck. yeah, it'll help you finish your script. you'll think about me...}
<A>__{he thumps his chest.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...make me your wrestler. then you'll lick that story of yours.}
<A>__{barton is tearfully sincere:}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{thanks, charlie.}
<A>__{charlie solemnly thrusts out his hand.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah, well, see you soon, friend. you're gonna be fine.}
<A>__{barton shakes. as they walk to the door:}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{you'll be back?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{don't worry about that, compadre. i will be back.}
<A>__{barton shuts the door behind charlie, locks it, and turns around.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the room. the bed. the blood stained mattress. barton walks across the room and sits carefully at the edge of the bed, avoiding the rust colored stain. for a long beat, he sits still, but something is building inside. finally, when we hear the distant ding of the elevator arriving for charlie, it erupts: barton sobs, with the unself conscious grief of an abandoned child.}
<B>__{high wide shot}
<A>__{barton weeping, alone on the bed, next to the rust colored stain.}
