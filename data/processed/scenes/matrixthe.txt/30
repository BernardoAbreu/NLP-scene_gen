<L>__{interior hotel lafayette}
<A>__{it is a place of putrefying elegance, a rotting host of urban maggotry. trinity leads neo from the stairwell down the hall of the thirteenth floor. they stop outside room 1313.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{this is it.}
<A>__{neo can hear his own heart pounding.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{let me give one piece of advice. be honest. he knows more than you can possibly imagine.}
<L>__{interior room 1313}
<A>__{across the room, a dark figure stares out the tall windows veiled with decaying lace. he turns and his smile lights up the room.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{at last.}
<A>__{he wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible behind circular mirrored glasses. he strides to neo and they shake hands.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{welcome, neo. as you no doubt have guessed, i am morpheus.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{it's an honor.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{please. come. sit.}
<A>__{he nods to trinity.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{thank you, trinity.}
<A>__{she bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an adjacent room. they sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy leather chairs.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{i imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{you could say that.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{i can see it in your eyes. you have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.}
<A>__{a smile, razor thin, curls the corner of his lips.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{ironically, this is not far from the truth. but i'm getting ahead of myself. can you tell me, neo, why are you here?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{you're morpheus, you're a legend. most hackers would die to meet you.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{yes. thank you. but i think we both know there's more to it than that. do you believe in fate, neo?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{because i don't like the idea that i'm not in control of my life.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{i know exactly what you mean.}
<A>__{again, that smile that could cut glass.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{let me tell you why you are here. you are here because you have the gift.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what gift?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{i've watched you, neo. you do not use a computer like a tool. you use it like it was part of yourself. what you can do inside a computer is not normal. i know. i've seen it. what you do is magic.}
<A>__{neo shrugs.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{it's not magic.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{but it is, neo. it is. how else would you describe what has been happening to you?}
<A>__{he leans forward.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{we are trained in this world to accept only what is rational and logical. have you ever wondered why?}
<A>__{neo shakes his head.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{as children, we do not separate the possible from the impossible which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while a mind like yours can be very difficult.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{free from what?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{from the matrix.}
<A>__{neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of himself.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{do you want to know what it is, neo?}
<A>__{neo swallows and nods his head.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{it's that feeling you have had all your life. that feeling that something was wrong with the world. you don't know what it is but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad, driving you to me. but what is it?}
<A>__{the leather creaks as he leans back.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{the matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. you can see it out your window, or on your television. you feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes. it is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what truth?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{that you are a slave, neo. that you, like everyone else, was born into bondage... ... kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. a prison for your mind.}
<A>__{outside, the wind batters a loose pane of glass.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{unfortunately, no one can be told what the matrix is. you have to see it for yourself.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{hold out your hands.}
<A>__{in neo's right hand, morpheus drops a red pill.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{this is your last chance. after this, there is no going back.}
<A>__{in his left, a blue pill.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{you take the blue pill and the story ends. you wake in your bed and you believe whatever you want to believe.}
<A>__{the pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{you take the red pill and you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.}
<A>__{neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the moisture growing in his palms.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{remember that all i am offering is the truth. nothing more.}
<A>__{neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill. the cheshire smile returns.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{follow me.}
<A>__{he leads neo into the other room, which is cramped with high tech equipment, glowing ash bliie and electric green from the racks of monitors. trinity, apoc and cypher look up as they enter.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{i knew he would.}
<A>__{cypher saddles up to morpheus, talking in a hushed tone away from, neo.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{morpheus, i know what you believe but i think this is a mistake. we're rushing him. he's old. i'm afraid he might pop.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{haven't i always told you, cypher, not to let fear control your life. apoc, are we on line?}
<A>__{neo recognizes the large man from the el train.}
<C>__{apoc}
<D>__{almost.}
<A>__{he and trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex system of monitors, modules and drives.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{apoc? you wrote the four horsemen virus.}
<C>__{apoc}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{neo, time is always against us. will you take a seat there?}
<A>__{in the center of the room sits a chair. near the chair is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{i imagine you know sonething about virtual reality.}
<A>__{neo sits and trinity begins gently fixing white electrode disks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{a little.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{tell me about it.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{essentially, it's a hardware system that uses an apparatus; headgear, gloves and whatever to make you feel that you are in a computer program.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{if the virtual reality apparatus, as you called it, was wired to all of your senses and controlled them completely, would you be able to tell the difference between the virtual world and the real world?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{you might not, no.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{no, you wouldn't.}
<A>__{neo whispers to trinity.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{you did all this?}
<A>__{she nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears. they are wired to an old hotel phone.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{the pill you took is part of a trace program. it's going to make things feel a bit strange.}
<A>__{distantly, through the ear phones, he hears apoc pounding on a keyboard. sweat beads his face. his eyes blink and twitch when he notices the mirror. wide eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the mirror were becoming liquid.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{shit...}
<A>__{cypher works with apoc checking reams of phosphorescent data. trinity monitors neo's electric vital signs. neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers disappear beneath the rippling surface. quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored taffy stuck to his fingertips.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what is this? mescaline?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{just relax, neo.}
<A>__{the strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away, until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break. with the tinkling of glass, shimmering snowflakes of electric blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and fade. he looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored icicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running like wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms where he sees his face reflected.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{uh oh...}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{it's going into replication.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{apoc?}
<C>__{apoc}
<D>__{still nothing.}
<A>__{morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{tank, we're going to need the signal soon. stay calm, neo.}
<A>__{the mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up his arns like hundreds of insects.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{it's cold.}
<A>__{the mirror creeps up his neck as neo begins to panic, tipping his head as though he were sinking into the mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{it's all over me }
<A>__{morpheus is right next to him, with the phone.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{i got a fibrillation!}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{i knew it, i knew it...}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{shit! apoc?}
<A>__{streams of mercury run from neo's nose.}
<C>__{apoc}
<D>__{targeting... almost there.}
<A>__{an alarm, on trinity's monitor erupts.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{he's going into arrest!}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{he's gonna pop!}
<C>__{apoc}
<D>__{lock! i got him!}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{now, tank now!}
<A>__{his eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a high pitched electric scream erupts in the headphones it is a piercing shriek like a computer calling to another computer neo's body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were pulled into the holes of the phone sucked into his scream and swallowed by darkness.}
