<L>__{exterior jane chamber's garden day}
<A>__{bucky and jane drink iced tea. a glorious garden behind them.}
<C>__{jane chambers}
<D>__{so. what brings you around again? considering a courtin' the old rich widow?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{you're not that old. and you're not very widowed.}
<C>__{jane chambers}
<D>__{you either are or you aren't.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{you seem to be doing all right.}
<C>__{jane chambers}
<D>__{eldridge had cancer. i half expected it. we weren't that close anymore...you married?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{little over a year.}
<C>__{jane chambers}
<D>__{god. newlyweds. nothing better, is there?}
<A>__{bucky's face betrays his difficulties.}
<C>__{jane chambers }
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{so how well do you know the spragues?}
<C>__{jane chambers}
<D>__{eldridge and emmett went way back. they served on the california real estate board together. but emmett was a bit of a crook. my husband got him kicked off the board for building dangerous buildings under phony corporations.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{your husband sounds like a good man.}
<C>__{jane chambers}
<D>__{he had his moments. most of it was out of guilt. he owned slum blocks in san pedro. when he learned he had cancer, he really started feeling guilty. he voted democratic last year. even went in and had meetings with the city council. i'm sure he gave them dirt on emmett.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{i read an article in the paper.}
<C>__{jane chambers}
<D>__{same day eldridge killed himself. apropos, i guess.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{maybe your husband }
<C>__{jane chambers}
<D>__{my husband was rich and did a mean charleston. i loved him until i found out he was cheating on me. now i'm starting to love him again. how strange.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{it's not so strange.}
<A>__{they watch each other, enjoying each other's company. a strange emotional peace.}
<C>__{jane chambers}
<D>__{you're very accepting of other people's frailties. you're young. you should have illusions.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{i'm a cop. illusions aren't standard issue.}
<C>__{jane chambers}
<D>__{so how'd a cop get mixed up with madeleine sprague? it was madeleine, i assume?}
<A>__{bucky's gut clenches.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{i stopped her at a red light. one thing led to another. why do you assume it was madeleine?}
<C>__{jane chambers}
<D>__{don't play dumb, bucky. the girl's a roundheels. always has been.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{jane. don't be catty.}
<C>__{jane chambers}
<D>__{i'm sorry. she can't help it i'm sure. she probably inherited it from her mother.}
<A>__{before bucky can press jane stands up with the tray of iced tea. the visit is over.}
<C>__{jane chambers}
<D>__{you figure out the rest, officer.}
<A>__{he follows her back inside.}
