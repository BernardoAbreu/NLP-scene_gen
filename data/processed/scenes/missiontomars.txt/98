<L>__{exterior space. day}
<A>__{the astronauts are outside the ship, tethered to each other with long shock cords. other cords, clipped to their suits, trail gear bags. phil clutches a silver metallic case his precious computer repair kit. woody is in the mmu. they're all rotating at the same speed as the ship behind them.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{on my mark, seven percent left thruster. three, two, one, fire.}
<A>__{all four astronauts fire a brief, simultaneous burst from the tiny attitude control thrusters in their suits. this stops their rotation, bringing their travel under control. the ship continues spinning in the background. woody takes a final look at the charred, doomed mars recovery. the only home they've known for six months. he exchanges a silent glance with the others. they all expect to be dead in the next few minutes. woody takes a breath, nods.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{okay. let's go.}
<A>__{he pops the big thrusters on the mmu and starts heading away from the ship. the cord between woody and the others pulls taut and they start to follow.}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{of woody leading them away from the crippled spaceship, against the magnificent backdrop of the blood red planet below. four tiny figures, all alone in space.}
<B>__{angle on mcconnell and the others}
<A>__{as phil looks back, his eyes searching the stars.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{what're you looking for?}
<C>__{phil}
<P>__{(softly, sadly)}
<D>__{earth.}
<C>__{terri}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hey. when we get back? we really will have to try this in the sim.}
<A>__{he tries to smile. so does she.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{how we doin' on fuel, woody?}
<A>__{woody eyes a small display screen on his forearm.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{i'm at fifty percent.}
<P>__{(looking down)}
<D>__{but i don't see the remo.}
<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{everyone is looking back at the curve of mars against black space, expecting to see the remo coming up behind them.}
<B>__{terri}
<A>__{happens to glance directly below.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{there she is!}
<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{the black outline of the little cargo craft drifts against the red of mars.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{jesus. she's not where i thought she'd be.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{we're going to miss her.}
<B>__{woody}
<A>__{looks again at his display screen, frustrated.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{we can't catch it. not like this.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<P>__{(thinking quickly)}
<D>__{use the tether.}
<A>__{from a compartment on the side of the mmu, woody pulls out...}
<B>__{the tether gun}
<A>__{about the size of a large flare gun. there's a carabiner like hook five inches in diameter on the front of the gun.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{we'll only have one, maybe two shots before she's out of reach.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{it'll be better if i leave you the gun while i run out to the remo. i've got enough fuel left for that.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{you'll be going too fast.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{i will aim to overshoot, then brake like hell; arc it in.}
<A>__{mcconnell looks at him. they both know how risky this is, and they also know it's their only chance. woody flips a switch on the gun and pulls on the hook. off it comes, trailing wire. woody clips the hook to the mmu, then hands mcconnell the gun.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{seeya in a few.}
<A>__{mcconnell nods. woody and terri exchange a look tender, loving then woody turns around and fires the mmu jets at full throttle. as woody pulls away, line unspools from the tether gun.}
<B>__{woody and the remo}
<A>__{woody is chasing the remo from above. it's as if he were in an airplane, trying to land on a car racing along a freeway. woody is picking up speed quickly. maybe too quickly. he checks his armpad display screen.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{okay. i'm on path to overshoot. i'm gonna take the edge off.}
<A>__{woody starts braking with the mmu thrusters as hard as he can.}
<B>__{close on the thrusters}
<A>__{glowing with orange flame. they suddenly cut off. woody's eyes show alarm. he checks his display.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{i'm out. coming in hot. still long.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{abandoning the unit. i will brake with suit jets.}
<A>__{woody hits some buttons and the mmu's latches snap open. he grabs the hook connected to the tether line, then pushes himself free of the mmu, starts firing his small suit jets. woody's pov he's still going very quickly. with mcconnell, terri and phil floating close together. the tether line is still unspooling from the gun. they watch woody, below and ahead of them, as he races towards the remo. terri's heart is in her throat.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{oh jesus. jesus...}
<A>__{mcconnell reaches a glove out, touching her arm.}
<B>__{back on woody}
<A>__{still speeding towards the remo. his suit jets cut out.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{suit jets gone. but i'm gonna make contact...}
<A>__{mcconnell, terri and phil stare at woody's distant figure.}
