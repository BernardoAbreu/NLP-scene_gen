<A>__{buried behind open books and crumpled up paper, kate labors in earnest. she stops suddenly, almost violently, and studies the notes in front of her. the coffee cup falls from her hand and breaks.}
<C>__{dr. kay}
<P>__{(calling from her office)}
<D>__{kate, are you all right?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{fine! i'm fine.}
<A>__{she covers her papers and self consciously cleans up her mess. she sits down slowly and peeks at her notes. she has solved the puzzle that will send leopold back. she looks up in disbelief and glances through her window around the lab. everyone is hard at work. helplessly, she stares back at the paper on her desk. she pulls open her drawer and takes out the picture of carlson. she stares at it for a long time. she opens her mouth to call for the others, stops, and looks at the photo. slowly, with great indecision, kate crumples up the paper. she returns the picture to the drawer. after a long moment, she opens a book, feigning research, her mind a million miles away.}
