<A>__{randal pulls a soda from the cooler.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{want something to drink? i'm buying.}
<C>__{dante }
<D>__{no, thanks.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{who was on your phone this morning at about two thirty? i was trying to call for a half an hour.}
<C>__{dante }
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{i wanted to use your car.}

<C>__{randal}
<D>__{snake cake?}
<A>__{dante sits in his seat behind the register. randal grabs a paper and joins him behind the counter.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{you don't want to know.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{you called caitlin again?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{she called me.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{did you tell veronica?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{one fight a day with veronica is about all i can stomach, thanks.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{what do you two fight about?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i guess it's not really fighting. she just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(opening paper)}
<D>__{i will bet the most frequent topic of arguments is caitlin bree.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{you win.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{i'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. forget caitlin bree. you've been with veronica for how long now?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{seven months.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{chick's nuts about you. how long did you date caitlin?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{five years.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{chick only made you nuts. she cheated on you how many times?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{eight and a half.}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(looks up from paper)}
<D>__{eight and a half?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{party at john k's senior year. i get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. caitlin comes in and dives all over me.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{that's cheating?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{in the middle of it, she calls me brad.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{she called you brad?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{she called me brad.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{that's not cheating. people say crazy shit during sex. one time, i called this girl "mom."}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i hit the lights and she freaks. turns out she thought i was brad michaelson.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{she was supposed to meet brad michaelson in a bedroom. she picked the wrong one. she had no idea i was even at the party.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{great story, isn't it?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{that girl was vile to you.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{interesting postscript to that story: do you know who wound up going with brad michaelson in the other dark bedroom?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{your mother.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{allan harris.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{chess team allan harris?!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{the two moved to idaho together after graduation. they raise sheep.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{that's frightening.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{it takes different strokes to move the world.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{in light of this lurid tale, i don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with caitlin she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{because there was a lot of good in our relationship.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{oh yeah.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i'm serious. aside from the cheating, we were a great couple. that's what high school's all about algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{you think things would be any different now?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{they are. when she calls me now, she's a different person she's frightened and vulnerable. she's about to finish college and enter the real world. that's got to be scary for anyone.}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(suddenly recalling)}
<D>__{oh shit, i've got to place an order.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i'm talking to myself here.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{no, no, i'm listening. she's leaving college, and...?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{...and she's looking to me for support. and i think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{what about veronica?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i think the arguments veronica and i are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that i can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with caitlin.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{caitlin's on the same wave length?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i think it's safe to say yes.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{then i think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{all four?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{you, veronica, caitlin...}
<P>__{(lays paper flat)}
<D>__{...and caitlin's fiance.}
<A>__{the headline of the engagement announcement reads, bree to}
<B>__{wed asian design major.}
