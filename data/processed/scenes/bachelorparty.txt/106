<L>__{interior hotel suite night}
<A>__{rick, ryko, stan, o'neill enter with the "moose."}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{hi, guys. we brought back a friend.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{it's bullwinkle.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{gentlemen... ladies... for your viewing pleasure, meet mike the magical sexual mule.}
<A>__{o'neill lifts the head off the moose costume, revealing a real burro. the burro shows all his teeth as burros are apt to do when excited. o'neill and stan zip off the rest of his costume, revealing a well endowed beast.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{how about this, a trojan donkey.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{and here's mike's partner, in more ways than one. a gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. the very lovely, miss desiree...}
<A>__{desiree, an erotic, tall woman wearing a leather face mask, comes out of the bedroom carrying a long whip. desiree puts ravel's "bolero" on the phonograph; then she starts to sway her hips sensuously in front of the animal. angle the party guests they all scream and holler approval. angle desiree she rubs up against the donkey, shaking her backside against the animal's.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{swell. she's gonna pin her tail on the donkey.}
<A>__{now all eyes are on desiree as she does an erotic striptease. angle the donkey it is getting bored and a little hungry. it bends its head to the left and spots the table with food on it. it bends over and starts munching on some cole slaw. angle desiree to the catcalls of the partygoers, desiree is getting all worked up, stripping down to a g string.}
<B>__{the donkey}
<A>__{it's had enough cole slaw. now it sniffs at larry's drug smorgasbord and then starts to chomp on a few pills. next it sticks its head into the lines of coke and snorts them up in one gigantic sniff. angle desiree she lets her long, flowing hair hang down over her breasts. then she takes a mattress and sets it on the floor. she rolls on it and sways her hips sensuously on her knees. angle her audience rick can't believe he's seeing this. the other guys are screaming at the top of their lungs. even larry seems spell bound. angle the donkey it doesn't look so hot as it finishes off every drug on the table. angle desiree she moves over to the donkey, hits him on the side gently with her whip, then pulls him over to her mattress. the donkey's blood shot eyes are the size of saucers. once again he shows his teeth in a kind of shit eating grin. desiree drops to the mattress and beckons the animal to her. mike the donkey obediently does as he's told, moving to her in a trance like, very turned on state.}
<C>__{desiree}
<D>__{c'mon, mike... come to mama.}
<A>__{the donkey takes another step forward, and then suddenly rears up on his hind legs, snorting. he starts bucking wildly. the crowd moves out of his way as the animal goes berserk for a few seconds, then without warning collapses in a heap on the floor. everyone goes rushing up to it. chulo and laverne enter the room, followed by several of the other contestants and others from the beauty pageant.}
<C>__{chulo}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{hey, you guys, i'm getting married.}
<P>__{(to laverne)}
<D>__{we're gonna make lots of kids.}
<A>__{he looks over and sees everyone gathered around mike.}
<C>__{chulo}
<D>__{what the hell happened?}
<A>__{gary shushes him. we push in on dr. stan, who is listening for signs of life in the animal's chest. finally stan stands up somberly.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{drug overdose.}
<C>__{desiree}
<D>__{you mean it's...}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{afraid so. i did everything i could.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{it's my fault. he's dead because... i left those drugs...}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{it's really not all your fault. i was talking to mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. personal things, you know. made some bad investments. at least now he's peaceful...}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{c'mon, we gotta get this thing out of here.}
<A>__{o'neil places the moosehead on the donkey as rick, gary, chulo and stan pull the donkey out into the hall like pallbearers at a funeral.}
