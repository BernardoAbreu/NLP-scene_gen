<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{i don' believe it. our robbie?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{our robbie.}
<C>__{aokee}

<C>__{alex}
<D>__{that's what i was thinking.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{well, go get him. we need to make ready. he not just walk in and win this thing.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you heard it. he's in the kitchen...}
<A>__{alex goes into the back. aokee sits at a table. robbie comes out of the kitchen wearing a dishwasher apron.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{robbie, sit down. alex, make up a volcano. this boy in training.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(sitting down, worried)}
<D>__{what did i spill now?}

<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{robbie, alex tell me you are some kind of surfer. this true?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i dunno. yeah, surfing is usually how i spend my summers.}
<C>__{aokee}

<D>__{yeah. some kind of trophy.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{surfer king trophy. very big. very nice.}

<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i dunno...seems kind of silly to me.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's a big deal. every girl wants to date you. every guy wants to be you. special privileges...we all wear standard uniforms. the surfer king gets to be creative. you ever see the cowboy hat cowboy wears?}

<C>__{alex}
<D>__{he's a myth.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{oh, no. pipeman very real. works here in park. low profile. you must find him and convince him to teach you the secrets of the thunder bay wave. this not the ocean, surf boy.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{pipeman. the banzai pipeline. i get it. some kind of legendary surf champ. where do we find him?}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{i only see him once, maybe twice. stay behind scenes. but here he is and find him you must.}
<P>__{(to robbie)}
<D>__{so. you do this?}
<A>__{robbie looks at them, thinking for a moment.}
