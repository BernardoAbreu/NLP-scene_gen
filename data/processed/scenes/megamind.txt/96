<L>__{interior roxanne's apartment day}
<A>__{roxanne awakens, finding herself tied to a chair in her living room. we hear noise from a tv in the background as she tries to adjust her vision. slowly, the blurry figure before her becomes clear. it's master mind. he sits on her lazy boy, reading what looks to be some kind of journal.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{wow, i always thought uberman was your first superhero but it looks like our little roxanne dated a linebacker in college.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{that's my diary.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{so it is.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{it's personal.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{well, then i wouldn't leave it in your underwear drawer for just anyone to find.}
<A>__{he throws the diary over his shoulder.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i need your help.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{so you knock me out and tie me to a chair?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{you're not going to like what i'm about to tell you.}
<A>__{as she tries to shake off her headache from being knocked unconscious, roxanne spots something on the tv.}
<B>__{on television}
<A>__{brad helms is huddled behind a van.}
<C>__{brad helms}
<D>__{it's chaos here in city square as city police }
<A>__{behind him, titan picks up a police car and throws it at a paddy wagon. both vehicles explode on impact.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{he's really out of control.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{tell me about it.}
<A>__{as if finally realizing something, roxanne looks back at master mind.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{i should have known. you have something to do with this, don't you? with titan turning evil.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{well, the evil thing he did by himself. my goal was to give myself purpose by creating an intellectual sparring partner.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{you're talking like you made him.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{and they call me master mind.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{let me get this straight. you missed getting your ass kicked, so you made a new guy to kick your ass. that's pathetic.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{in hindsight...}
<A>__{roxanne turns back to the tv to see a group of police officers open fire on titan. the bullets just deflect off his chest.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{and his powers, they're just like uberman's. why would he have his powers?}
<C>__{master mind}
<P>__{(almost ashamed)}
<D>__{i had some left over from something. i infused him with it.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{you did what!?}
<A>__{driven by rage, she struggles to tear out of her bonds. she finally relents, giving master mind a look fueled by pure hatred.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{yeah, that's why i decided to tie you up.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{you did all this because you wanted purpose?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{he seemed nice.}
<B>__{television}
<A>__{titan is standing on top of a destroyed police car. he waves for the camera to zoom in on him.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{closer. i want to show the people my real face.}
<A>__{he pulls off his mask, revealing himself as hal stewart to the public for the first time.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{recognize me?}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{hal stewart. he's the guy we thought saved that woman and kid. turned out he was just trying to save his own ass.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{yeah, good to know now!}
<B>__{television}
<A>__{titan throws the mask over this shoulder and hops off the car.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{that's right, i'm really hal stewart. former hero and bowling teacher at kingpin's bowling.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{roxanne turns to master mind, condescending him with her eyes.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{you picked a bowler to give super powers to?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{it's a modest profession!}
<B>__{television}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{with my new found power, i've recently started to wonder what sort of legacy i should leave. should i be a hero? i tried that once before even saved a lady and her baby from being squashed. i was treated like a god until everyone started to shit on me okay, so what if i didn't "purposely" save them!}
<A>__{he walks over and puts his hand on a large circular concrete shape just off camera.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{well, i'm going to make something that can't be taken away from me. i'm going to create a permanent monument to my greatness. one that won't be so easily forgotten or erased.}
<A>__{the camera pulls back revealing the giant concrete bowling ball from kingpin's.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{i intend to create a new category in the guinness book of world's records by rolling the biggest strike in the history of bowling.}
<A>__{he grabs the camera and points it to the downtown buildings. we realize they are perfectly aligned in bowling pin}
<B>__{formation.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{my thanks to the city planning commission. this wouldn't have been possible without them.}
<A>__{titan grabs the camera so it's pointing back at him again.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{tell your friends and family to tune in right here to this station at noon tomorrow.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{my god, he's nuts. that'll destroy the whole business triangle.}
<A>__{master mind seems to be contemplating something something bad.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{my lair is in the direct path of the ball.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{oh, real nice. wouldn't want anything to happen to your hideout, would we?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{you don't understand. i have certain equipment that's that's highly unstable.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i sort of have a hydrogen reactor, okay?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{a hydrogen reactor?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{it's experimental only one in the world...well, how do you think i power all my inventions? someone like me can't pay for electricity. the bills would be outrageous.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{a reactor?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{it creates 100 times the output of a nuclear one...if destroyed it could...}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{ vaporize the entire city!}
<C>__{master mind}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard, actually. that little baby is amazing. i'm quite proud of it.}
<C>__{master mind}
<P>__{(off her deadpan reaction)}
<D>__{i mean...we'd better find a way to stop him.}
<A>__{master mind thinks a moment.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{did uberman have a hideout?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{a cave, a solitary fortress of some kind. c'mon, all heros have a place to hang their capes up in. roxanne, it may be our only chance to find something, a clue, anything that could give us a fighting chance.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{it's under his house.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{whose house?}
<A>__{roxanne can hardly believe what she's telling him.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{wayne scott's.}
<A>__{master mind shoots up out of his chair.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{wayne scott? uberman was wayne scott!? wayne scott, the wealthy philanthropist? but he disappeared }
<C>__{roxanne}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{he disappeared just over two months ago when you killed him. not only did you rid the world of a hero, you killed a kind, noble, generous man.}
<A>__{perhaps ashamed, the super villain hangs his head. master mind walks behind roxanne and undoes her bonds. rubbing her wrists, she watches him as he walks over to the door.}
<C>__{roxanne }
<D>__{looks like you got what you always wanted. uberman is out of the picture and metro city is doomed.}
<A>__{he grabs the door knob and stops, considering her words.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{"metro city doomed." you know, i never thought i'd say something like this, but here it goes }
<A>__{he slowly turns to her, cue heroic music.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{not if i have anything to say about it.}
