<L>__{exterior condo complex night}
<A>__{night has fallen on the condo complex.}
<L>__{interior abby's condo living room night}
<A>__{mike avoids the cat while waiting in the living room.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{i just don't want to be perceived as a bimbo.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i don't want you to be a bimbo. you need to be two people, the saint and the sinner, the librarian and the stripper. it's a delicate balance. on one hand, you have to push the guy away with cold indifference and yet on the other hand be a sexually teasing tornado.}
<A>__{abby enters, looking amazing in a little black dress and sling backs. her hair and make up are sexy but not trashy.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{well just don't sit there. say something.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{glasses.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you need glasses.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{but i wear contacts. besides, doesn't the woman usually remove glasses during a makeover?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah, but we're going for a stripperlibrarian thing. right now, i wouldn't trust you to find me a book.}
<A>__{abby opens a drawer and takes out some glasses. she puts them on.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{not bad. now we need to practice flirting.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i know how to flirt.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{do you want to be an old maid?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{so, if i don't listen to you, i will be an old maid?}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(acting old)}
<D>__{"my name's abby and i'm arthritic and alone. i have eighteen cats who keep me company."}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{oh, ha ha. that's very funny.}
<P>__{(pretending to be mike)}
<D>__{"are you wearing underwear?"}
<A>__{she grabs his ass.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{come on! i wouldn't say that and i wouldn't grab ass.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(still as mike)}
<D>__{"hey babe, what's wrong with a little ass grabbing?"}
<P>__{(continuing to pinch his ass)}
<D>__{"i mean what's the point of you even having one unless it's there for me to grab it? you're just a set of orifices and a pair of tee tas."}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you're a deeply, deeply disturbed person.}
<A>__{switching tactics, abby slips into seductress mode, tracing her finger up and down his arm.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{maybe i'm just a good student.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{would you stop doing that?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{doing what?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{touching me with your finger.}
<A>__{she seductively leans into him.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{why? am i turning you on?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{she gives him a look.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{actually, i kind of like it.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{really...}
<A>__{she leans in closer.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{sucker.}
<A>__{he shoves her away.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no teaching the teacher.}
<A>__{just then, the doorbell rings.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{who is it?}
<C>__{colin }
<D>__{it's colin.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{oh my god!}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{told you he'd drop by.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(panicking)}
<D>__{i'm not ready for this. am i? i'm not.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{calm down. keep the conversation under a minute. be mysterious. keep him guessing.}
<A>__{mike leaps over the couch and hides. as abby walks over to the door and opens it. colin stands there.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{oh. hey.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{hi. wow, you look great.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{what happened to you today?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{you put me on hold and didn't call me back.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{that was you? i'm so sorry.}
<P>__{(steering him to the door)}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{can you call me later? i'm super busy.}
<A>__{she hustles him out the door.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{colin bangs on the door.}
<C>__{colin }
<D>__{abby wait...}
<A>__{mike pops up from under the couch. he gives her the thumbs up.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{now what?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{make him suffer.}
<C>__{colin }
<D>__{do you want to go the lobos game on saturday?}
<A>__{she looks at mike in amazement, then breaks into the happy dance. he watches, horrified at her spazziness.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what the hell is that?!}
<A>__{as she continues to dork out, we cut to : }
