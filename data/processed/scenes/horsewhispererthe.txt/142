<A>__{they ride up along a sloping ridge covered with pine trees. they come to the rim of a high bluff. they stop. they look out at the twin valleys that gave the ranch its name. and they can just see the old creek house hidden in the shade of some trees along the creek... tom looks over at annie, who is looking out over this beautiful vista.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it's a whole other world you have going on here. it just goes along, doing what it has to. and you're a part of it, you just wake up and, and there you are... and everything that seems like life or death some place else doesn't affect any of this one bit.}
<A>__{tom is impressed by her feelings. he sees her saddle cinch needs fixing and gets off his horse.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{lift your leg.}
<A>__{annie complies once she realizes what he's doing.}
<C>__{annie}

<A>__{tom can't find a beautiful enough word. but annie understands.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{she was the most beautiful thing i'd ever seen.}
<A>__{annie sees tom as if with new eyes his love for this woman he lost.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{why didn't it work out?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{she was never really happy here. she did the best she could.}
<A>__{annie looks at him and for the first time senses a kinship an understanding they both have of being torn between two worlds... a desire for home...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{grace told me you have a country house in connecticut. sounds like a beautiful place.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it is. it's lovely.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{ever think of moving there full time?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{we did at one pointerior when we thought we'd have more children. and we after tried. we tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.}
<A>__{there is an awkward silent beat for a moment. annie is momentarily self conscious. tom helps by speaking of himself;}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i hear that! see, i knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but i wanted to try i thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. my son would grow up here. maybe have one or two more. i'd teach 'em what i could. they'd play with my brother's kids. all grow up together. and even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was cause we'd keep it for 'em...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{that's very important to you, isn't it? home.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yeah, i think it is. and i don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids it's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{how did you find out all that?}
<A>__{tom looks right into her eyes and confesses without a shred of self consciousness.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i got lost.}
<A>__{they smiles.}
