<D>__{a little.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{that's normal, it frightens me sometimes. but i've got to go up to a patient's room in ward a. apparently they've had a little accident. surely you wouldn't prefer to clean that up?}

<D>__{well... maybe not.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{i know ward x is a scary place. but you'll get used to it.}
<C>__{lisa}
