<A>__{they do a hand slap maneuver that they have obviously worked out some time in the past. jaffa proceeds up to the customer relations kiosk, plops the box on the counter, and enters the kiosk. we see him open the box, it is full of cd's. he pulls winter covers off of an overhead area to reveal a cd player and amplifiers. he starts pushing buttons he's pushed a thousand times, and lights come on. he pulls down a microphone, and clicks a button to see if it works. he reaches into the box of cds and pulls one out. we see it is sheryl crow. he gets the cd, examines it, and pops it into the cd player. he once again picks the microphone and flips the switch as he pushes the "play" button on the cd player. his voice echoes through the park. "soak up the sun" begins playing.}
