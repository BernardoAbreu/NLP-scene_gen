<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{this is who i am...}
<P>__{(he pats his ample belly)}
<D>__{you see? there was a time i would stand against ten men and never give an inch, spitting into the jaws of hades all the while. there was a time my heart swelled to strap on the armor of rome. but now...}
<A>__{something flashes across proximo's eyes, something like tragedy.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{now i am just an entertainer.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{you said something to me once. you said in this life, we all die. all we can choose is how we die. and how we are remembered. do you recall those words?}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{then be remembered proudly. this is your time, proximo. stand at my side and be what you were. what you truly are. one last time.}
<A>__{a beat. proximo suddenly begins to weep rather histrionically maximus is a bit taken aback proximo dramatically flicks tears from his eyes and then can't keep the show up he bursts into laughter. maximus stares at him.}
<C>__{proximo}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{you might have spared yourself the speech, general. the lady lucilla bought all my gladiators two hours ago!}

<D>__{you pox ridden bastard !}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{i am the richest trainer in the empire! and i will let my gladiators do anything you like! conspire away, general!}
<A>__{maximus can only laugh as well.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{but i tell you if you survive this madness i want you to go into business with me. i will give you a quarter of my holdings.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{a quarter?!}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{a third. and not a hair more. and you'll have to start in the provinces! cleaning up the lion shit!}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{you know, if you were half so awful as you pretend, you'd be a terrifying man.}
<A>__{maximus shakes his head, smiling, and goes. proximo sits for a moment. then he rises and goes to a heavy chest. he looks at the chest for a moment and then opens it. inside is his old lorica segmentata. he gazes at his armor, considering what he once was. and what he now is.}
