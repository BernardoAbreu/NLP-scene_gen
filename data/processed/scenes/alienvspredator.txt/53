<A>__{the door suddenly blows open but nothing enters except a flurry of snow. every man in the room draws a gun. the blur of a cloaked predator enters the room. one man is hit by an invisible hand. the force of the blow sending him crashing to the ground, his neck broken. in an instant, another man seems to be levitating! his feet are a clear three feet off the ground, and he is rising still further into the air. gurgling noises are coming from the him. only now do we see the shimmering humanoid outline behind him. a predator has impaled the man and is lifting him into the air! the last survivor draws a bead on the shimmering blur but is suddenly flung backwards with incredible force. something invisible has impaled him, slamming him back against the wall and pinning him there. his feet hang six inches off the ground. in his last dying moments, the man watches a futuristic spear slowly materialize in his chest.}
