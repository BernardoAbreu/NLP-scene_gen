<L>__{exterior runway day}
<A>__{we're on the runway of an airport in northern italy. caption: "three months later" a stretch limousine pulls up on the tarmac. a still drunk james hunt and several good looking women, rowdy friends (and hangers on) spill out of the limo... they cross the tarmac towards their waiting private jet, passing other jets, when james stops. he's seen something that has caught his eye. james sends his friends on ahead to their waiting jet, and walks over to a small private jet, (a learjet 35)...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i heard you were spending more and more time in one of these...}
<A>__{a hunched pilot doing final checks. the figure turns. it's niki. his wounds have healed a little, but it's still a painful sight...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{do you fly?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{you should try it. if something goes wrong up there, you're on the edge, but have to stay within the rules. stick to regulations. suppress the ego. it's good discipline for the racing.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{and there i was thinking you were about to wax lyrical about the romance of flight. i should have known better.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{what brings you here?}
<A>__{james indicates his rowdy, cool looking friends..}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{a friend's wedding. at least i think it was a wedding. might have been a birthday. all a bit of a blur. how about you? been at fiorano?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{pre season testing.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{already? in february? you're relentless.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i'm not sure i meant it as a compliment.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{but it is one. relentlessness is good. means you're a fighter. that you never give up. behind my back i know some of you guys call me `the rat.' because i look like one. it's meant as an insult. but i don't mind it. rats are ugly, sure. and no one likes them. but they're intelligent. with a strong survival instinct.}
<A>__{james can't help smiling. that's niki.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{so when do you start testing? next week?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{are you mad? i didn't just win the biggest thing of my life so i could get right back to work.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{why? you need to. to prove to all the people who will always say you only won it because...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{because what...? because of your accident? is that other people, niki? or you? i won. on the all important day when it came down to it, we raced on equal terms in equally good cars.}
<C>__{james }
<D>__{you bottled and i had the guts to see it through.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{it's true. you won that race. and believe me if i had to lose that title to anyone, i'm happy it was you. but that doesn't change the fact you have to win again.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{because that's what it means to be a winner, no? it's a permanent condition. never stops or goes away. it stays with you always.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{that's winning? sounds like losing to me. some of life needs to be for pleasure, niki. what's the use of having a million cups and medals if you never have any fun? how is that winning?}
<A>__{the plane load of james's friends call out..."c'mon, james!"}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{you're right. i could learn from you. in hospital the toughest part of my treatment was the vacuum. pumping the shit out of my lungs. it was agony. while doing it, i was watching television...you winning all those races...and i was cursing you.. "that bastard, hunt", i would shout, "i hate that guy." one day the doctor said, "mr. lauda, may i offer one piece of advice? stop thinking of it as a curse to have been given an enemy in life. it can be a blessing, too." i said, "who are you, confucius?" he said, "a wise man gets more from his enemies than a fool from his friends." and you know, he's right. look at us. we were a pair of kids when we first met. hotheaded jerks in formula 3. headed nowhere. now we're both champions of the world. not bad.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{no, not bad.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{so don't let me down now. i need you busting my balls. get back to work.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i will, niki. but i intend to enjoy myself first. and so should you. you think you can?}
<A>__{niki stares. a blank look..}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{see you on race day, champ.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{you will. champ.}
<A>__{james goes. niki watches him, pulled into his plane by his laughing, cool friends. an unmistakable flicker of envy in his eyes. then niki turns, alone, and resumes his safety checks.}
