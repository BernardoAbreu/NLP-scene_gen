<C>__{bartender}
<P>__{(laughing and rolling his eyes)}
<D>__{what the hell is this, mariachi day? there is no work for you here!}
<A>__{azul walks the mean dude's table. their laughing quiets down a bit as azul stands before them. the bartender stops smiling.}
<C>__{azul}
<D>__{bartender... one beer.}
<A>__{the bartender nods and grabs a frosty glass. he begins to fill up at the tap.}
<C>__{azul }
<P>__{(without looking at him)}
<D>__{in a bottle, wey.}
<A>__{bartender stops filling the beer, stares at the half full glass for a moment, then drinks the beer. azul is staring at the three mean dudes. they stare back. the bartender slaps the unopened bottle down at the counter.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{ready.}
<A>__{azul doesn't pay attention to him.}
<C>__{azul}
<D>__{i'm looking for an old friend of mine. his name is... moco. do you know where i can find him.}

<C>__{azul}
<D>__{so you know him?}
<B>__{main mean dude}
<A>__{we work for him.}
<C>__{azul}
<D>__{that's too bad.}
<A>__{azul turns to the mean dude sitting to his left, and places the guitar in his hands. the mean dude is confused.}
<C>__{azul }
<D>__{hold it please.}
<A>__{azul opens the case and pulls out the mac 10. the other two mean dudes are already reaching for their pistols. the bartender ducks beneath the counter. azul fires a million bullets into two of the mean dudes, (the other is holding the case in shock). their chests explode, causing neat little dollops of flesh and blood fly everywhere. the mean dude holding the guitar case is frozen with fear. he manages to look up at azul, who is watching the mean dudes die a slow, bloody death. the barrel of the mac 10 is smoking. azul turns slowly to the mean dude holding the case. azul aims his mac 10 in the dude's face. still frozen holding the case, he spends his last moments looking down the gun's barrel.}
