<A>__{it is the kind of bar where the well to do folks of la go to pick up or be picked up. lesser known actors, agents and executives of all ages. into this bar comes ben. ben is in his thirties. he is wearing an armani suit that could use a visit to the dry cleaner's. he hasn't shaved in the last twenty four hours (but neither has any of the actors in the bar). he is a good looking man but is clearly in trouble of some kind. although still in control of his faculties, it becomes clear in the following scene that he is much the worse for wear with drink. he looks around the room until he sees someone he recognizes and then walks over to a table where two couples are seated. the men are young execs, the girls, both blonde and busty, have very white teeth and smile all of the time. the camera follows ben over to the table. one of the execs looks up as ben gets close. he recognizes him but delays his recognition until the last moment in the hope that ben is not looking at him.}
