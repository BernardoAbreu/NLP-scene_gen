<L>__{interior enterprise ready room}
<A>__{picard stands in his ready room. a flickering light shimmers across the room. and a perfect holographic representation of shinzon appears before him.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{you can't trace my holographic emitters, captain. so don't bother. and you can't contact starfleet. we're quite alone.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{we are.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{it's just the two of us now, jean luc, as it should be... your ship and mine... you and me.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{why are you here?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{to accept your surrender. i can clearly destroy you at any time. lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{and what of the enterprise?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i have little interest in your quaint vessel, captain. if the enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you know that's not possible.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(intense)}
<D>__{look at me, shinzon! do you feel the blood pumping inside you? your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. it's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. to be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.}
<A>__{picard looks at him deeply, relentlessly refusing to give up.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i know you as well as i know myself, shinzon. there was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{long ago.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{not so long.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{childish dreams, captain. lost in the dilithium mines of remus. i'm what you see now.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i see more than what you are.}
<A>__{picard steps toward him.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i see what you could be.}
<A>__{shinzon slowly backs away as picard continues to move toward him relentlessly.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{the man who is jean luc picard and shinzon of remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! he is better than that!}
<C>__{shinzon}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{he is what his life has made him!}
<A>__{shinzon is in turmoil. picard senses this. he proceeds quietly:}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{and what will he do with that life?}
<A>__{shinzon looks at him, questioning.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{if i were to beam to your ship... let you complete your medical procedure, give you a full life... what would you do with the time?}
<A>__{shinzon doesn't respond.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you once asked me about your past. your history. when i was your age, i burned with ambition. i was very proud and my pride often hurt people. i made every wrong choice a young man can... but one thing saved me... i had a father who believed in me. who took the time to teach me a better way. you have the same father.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{so if i gave you my life, what would you do with it? would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? or could you change? could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? a father's words you never heard? could you do that?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{but you want to.}
<A>__{shinzon doesn't respond. but picard knows he has made a connection. for this brief moment reconciliation is possible. he proceeds quietly:}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{let me tell you about our father.}
<A>__{shinzon looks at him with an aching sadness. what might have been.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{that's your life... not mine.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{it's too late.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you can still make a choice! make the right one now!}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i have no choices! i can't fight what i am!}
<A>__{shinzon backs away, unable to fight his nature:}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i will show you my true nature. your nature. and as earth dies remember that i'm forever shinzon of remus! and my voice will echo through time long after yours has faded to a dim memory.}
<A>__{shinzon ends the transmission and his holographic image flickers and fades away. picard stands alone, drained.}
