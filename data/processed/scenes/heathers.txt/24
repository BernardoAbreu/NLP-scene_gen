<L>__{interior pauline fleming's classroom day}
<A>__{the desks of the classroom have been maneuvered into an amusingly chaotic position by pauline's pupils. she is furious.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i said a circle you imbeciles! forget it! just sit down. i'm just so thrilled to be given an example of everything i've taught you. that example is heather chandler. i have the note!}
<A>__{pauline melodramatically lifts the suicide note. the class aaahs.}
<C>__{male student}
<D>__{all right!}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i will pass the suicide note around the room so you can feel its tragic beauty for yourself. let us share together the feelings the suicide has spurred in us all. who wants to begin?}
<C>__{female student}
<D>__{i heard it was really gnarly. she drank liquid plumber and comet and stuff then she smashed....}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{now, now, we're not here to rehash the coroner's report. let's talk emotions . the all out nerd are we going to be tested on this?}
<A>__{a stunned pauline glares until preppie peter dawson speaks. the note continues to be breathlessly passed around.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{heather and i used to go together, but she said i was boring. i realize now i wasn't really boring. she was just dissatisfied with her life.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{that's very good peter.}
<A>__{veronica lets out a laugh that she disguises as a sob by putting her hands over her face.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{dear veronica, heather was your soulmate.....share.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{heather was cool, but cruel. the good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.}
<A>__{the class stares to veronica as the suicide note is passed to her. she acknowledges it in horror, passes it on, then continues, realizing her ability to create truths for a captive audience.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{she realized the only way she could be happy was to give up her power and the only way she could do that was death.}
<A>__{pauline cries. the pupils applaud. veronica queasily smiles.}
