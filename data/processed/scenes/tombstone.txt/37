<L>__{ext desert day}
<A>__{wyatt is up on his stallion, riding along the foot of a high hill. coming to a cut, he suddenly stops. josephine is 100 yards up ahead, gorgeously impressive in a black velvet riding habit, riding side saddle through the cut on a pretty mare.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{oh, hell...}
<A>__{looking for an escape, wyatt turns up a narrow trail on the side of the cut. he follows it as it winds around the hill then abruptly drops back down and comes out on the other side of the cut right in front of josephine. she waves. he groans:}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{well, hello.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{we've never actually met. my name's }
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{wyatt earp, i know. i was beginning to think we'd never meet. this is fortuitous. that means lucky.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{i know what it means.}
<A>__{suddenly wyatt's stallion groans nervously, throwing its head, aroused by the presence of the mare.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{easy now... that mare's in season.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{oh...}
<P>__{(calms her horse)}
<D>__{now she's starting. how do they know?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{they know. it's the scent. we better split 'em up.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{i have a better idea, let's run it out of them!}
<A>__{before wyatt can stop her she's off at a full gallop. wyatt pauses, debating with himself. finally:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{yeah, i'm an oak all right.}
<A>__{he takes off at a dead run. catching up, the horses find their rhythm, breaking into a smooth gallop, flying over a jet black plain of volcanic ash into a rolling meadow carpeted with yellow desert poppies, so bright it almost hurts your eyes to look at them. coming off a rise the desert floor shears off into a wide crevice. josephine heads right at it.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{you're not that crazy, are you?}
<C>__{jospehine}
<D>__{oh, yes i am!}
<A>__{a crack of her crop and she streaks toward it. wyatt grits his teeth and follows suit. the sound of their hoofbeats stops for a long instant as they take the jump together, sailing through the air side by side, josephine giggling like a little girl. they light on the other side and gallop on....}
