<L>__{interior car, great northern peninsula day}
<A>__{quoyle driving a winding, rutted road, high above the coastline. cracked cliffs in volcanic glazes. long abandoned settlements jutting from raw granite. icebergs on the horizon above the rumpled, creased fabric of a brilliant blue sea. beside him...}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{on the map, here. quoyle pointerior named after us. you.}
<A>__{it all seems at once awe inspiring, frighteningly lonely. and hostile as hell.}
<L>__{exterior quoyle's point sunset}
<A>__{the car pulls up in a shroud of mist. our family climbs out, stares into what seems the center of a dense cloud, until... ...the fog lifts. and like a ghost, a green house appears. then, disappears. then, appears again. this time, to stay.}
<C>__{agnis }
<D>__{i was born here.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{the green makes me hurl.}
<P>__{(warren whimpers)}
<D>__{her, too.}
<A>__{the cloud lifts further, and we see the house stands alone on a rocky pointerior the bay roils far below. half the window panes are gone. holes in the roof, paint flaking everywhere. lonely and scary as any haunted house.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{empty 44 years. and look at that roofline, straight as a ruler.}
<A>__{quoyle looks at her. looks at the house. looks at her.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{take it easy. floor mighta fallen into the cellar.}
<C>__{agnis }
<D>__{not likely. there is no cellar. no foundation, neither.}
<A>__{she takes bunny's squirming hand and starts toward the house, as if crossing jordan.}
<C>__{agnis }
<D>__{the whole thing's lashed with cable, to iron rings set in the rock!}
<A>__{he just stands there. sees the cables now, the rings.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{uh. why would they do th...}
<C>__{agnis }
<D>__{long story!}
<A>__{apparently a private one, too. keeps walking.}
