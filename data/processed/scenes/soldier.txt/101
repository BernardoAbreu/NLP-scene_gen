<L>__{interior bedroom morning}
<A>__{sudden silence! todd blinks awake. he looks around. it's the same bedroom, but morning light is streaming in the high window. he can hear sounds...laughter...coming from beyond the door.}
<L>__{interior other room}
<A>__{nathan is wobbling forward with wide eyes as mace holds one of his hands and sandra holds the other. they're teaching the child to walk, encouraging each step. but when they let go, nathan totters forward only one step before landing flat on his ass. mace and sandra laugh, making the whole thing a game, and nathan, after a moment of confusion, joins in the laughter. it's a warm moment until sandra, sensing a presence, turns toward the bedroom, suddenly serious. mace follows her look. todd is standing in the doorway, supporting himself on the door frame...his soldier's eyes full of unspoken menace... one leg heavily bandaged.}
<C>__{sandra}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{you must be...you must be feeling better.}
<A>__{todd says nothing. his eyes flick to nathan. mace is watching todd sharply.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{we're teaching the boy to walk.}
<C>__{sandra}
<P>__{(nervously filling silence)}
<D>__{he's late learning. he was sick for a long time.}
<A>__{todd says nothing. his eyes follow mace who's gone to the corner where he's seizing a heavy metal rod that might be a weapon. todd tenses. ready. dangerous. as mace turns toward him, mace doesn't notice the danger in todd's eyes.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{i got something for you.}
<A>__{he innocently approaches with the metal rod. super alert, todd watches mace hold the rod out to him.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{todd looks mistrustful.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{like this.}
<A>__{mace demonstrates, using the rod like a cane.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{see?}
<A>__{expressionless, watches mace use the cane.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{practice with it. in a day or two maybe you'll be strong enough to go out to the garden with sandra.}
<A>__{mace never even realizes how much danger he was in.}
