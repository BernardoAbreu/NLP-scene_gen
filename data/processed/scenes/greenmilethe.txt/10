<L>__{interior shack morning}
<A>__{dark in here, cobwebby and decrepit. we see paul approaching outside the grimy window. he steps up to the glass and shades his eyes, peering curiously in as we}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior nursing home day}
<A>__{paul approaches the back door, returning from his walk. he reaches for the knob...and a figure in white lunges from behind the dumpster to grab his wrist. he whirls, gasping in fright it's brad dolan, wearing his orderly's uniform.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{out for a little stroll, paulie?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{let go...}
<A>__{paul tries to pull away, but dolan's got him tight.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{what's with this poncho you got on, huh? this isn't yours.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i got it off the wall there. there's a whole row of them.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{but not for you, paulie, that's the thing. those are for the staff.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i just borrowed it. don't see what harm it does.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{it's not about harm, it's about rules. you probably don't think an old fart like you has to mind rules anymore, but that's just not true.}
<A>__{brad's eyes keep shifting he obviously doesn't mind abusing the elderly as long as he doesn't get caught doing it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm sorry if i broke the rules.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{you got no business up in those woods anyway, especially in the rain. what if you fall and bust a hip, huh? who you think's gonna have to hoss your sorry old bacon back down here? me, that's who.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you're hurting me!}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{what do you do up there, anyway? you're too old to go jerk off, so what do you do?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{nothing. i just walk, that's all, i like to walk!}
<A>__{brad lashes out and grabs paul's other hand, which he's been holding tightly clenched shut.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{come on. open up. let poppa see.}
<A>__{paul uncurls his fingers, revealing the crushed remnants of a bit of toast, his palm slick with a greasy oleo smear.}
<C>__{elaine }
<D>__{paul?}
<A>__{they turn. elaine stands just inside the screen door with a cup of tea. brad's eyes become calculated, wondering how much she's seen. elaine keeps her tone level, betraying nothing:}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i saw you coming back, thought you'd like some tea.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you coming in?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{mr. dolan and i were...chatting. about the weather. i think we're through now.}
<A>__{brad lets paul loose, leans close:}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{paulie? you tell anyone i squeezed your po' ol' hand, i will tell 'em you're having senile delusions. who you think they'll believe?}
<A>__{brad walks off. paul turns, watches him go. the screen door opens and elaine steps out, her face pale. paul gives her a strained, though grateful, smile as we}
