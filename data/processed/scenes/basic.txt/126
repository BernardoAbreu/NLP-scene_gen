<T>__{yelling over the hurricane:}
<C>__{nunez}
<D>__{put it down!}
<A>__{a mexican stand off. the rain continues to fall.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i just want to go!}
<A>__{nunez shakes his head.}
<C>__{nunez}
<D>__{you were gonna kill me, pike! thought you were my friend!}
<A>__{dunbar, torn. he can't bring himself to shoot, but he can't surrender either.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i have to get kendall to a hospital!}
<C>__{nunez}
<D>__{he was gonna kill me too!}
<A>__{silence. the two men still facing each other.}
<P>__{nunez {cont'd)}
<D>__{i snapped mueller's neck! he was my best friend and i had to snap his neck because he was gonna shoot me for drugs! for west!}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{we don't have to do this! you go that way, i will go this way!}
<A>__{nunez laughs.}
<C>__{nunez}
<D>__{you'll shoot me in the back!}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{you killed three people! isn't that enough for one night?}
<A>__{more silence. neither moves. the sky above, a maelstrom.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i don't want to die out here, roberto! do you?}
<A>__{nunez, staring at him. deciding.}
<C>__{nunez}
<D>__{if you even twitch...}
<A>__{dunbar nods. nunez begins backing away, rifle still trained on him. and then dunbar spies something behind and to the left of nunez... west. staring down at him from behind some brush. watching. nunez, slowly backing away. he pauses as his foot catches on a fallen branch. looks away from dunbar for a split second to step over it... west nods to dunbar as if to say "go on. . . "}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{forgive me. ..}
<A>__{and dunbar fires. nunez, caught by the burst, goes down. the echo of the gunshots, swallowed by the storm. dunbar lowers his head in agony. west walks down.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{congratulations, cadet pike. you get the gold star.}
<A>__{dunbar stares at his sergeant through the rain.}
<C>__{dun bar}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{west smiles. tilts his head to kendall.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{you'd best get him out of here. don't worry about the bodies, they'll be taken care of.}
<A>__{dunbar doesn't move.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{this is where we part ways, cadet. you tell them i died out here, or i will come back for you. tell them one of the others did me. mueller, childs, i don't care who. you and kendall, you tell them a story.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you can tell a story, can't you?}
<A>__{dunbar doesn't reply. west laughs and flips him a salute.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{dismissed.}
<A>__{and west turns and walks away, stepping over nunez. giving dunbar a clear shot at his back. dunbar raises his rifle, wanting, needing, dying to shoot the old man... but he can't. west disappears into the bayou. a groan from the ground. kendall. dunbar's reverie broken, he leans down, beginning to unbutton the dunbar uniform...}
