<C>__{teemo}
<D>__{northeast is that way. we've come west and south. i think.}
<A>__{madmartigan dumps a big log on the fire, spraying the brownies with sparks.}
<C>__{rool}
<D>__{watch it! you're gonna set us on fire.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{not a bad idea.}
<A>__{madmartigan terrorizes them with a flaming stick. then he squats beside willow and the baby.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{so you're on your way to tir asleen, huh? i hate to tell you this, willow, but tir asleen dosn't exist.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{yes it does. the fairy queen told me.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{the fairy queen? and the baby here's a princess? and these two rodents are your guides?}
<A>__{he shakes his head sceptically, stretches out and puts his feet up on a log.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{yeah well...in the morning i think i will be on my way.}
<A>__{he laughs sarcastically. willow sets down the baby. he takes off kiaya's necklace and fingers it sadly.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{madmartigan, i need your help.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{my help? a great magician like you? you don't need any help.}
<A>__{willow stares at him angrily.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{but you're a great swordsman!}
<A>__{he jumps and starts pacing around the fire. rool and teemo dive for cover.}
<C>__{willow}
<P>__{(explodes)}
<D>__{you're not a warrior, madmartigan! a warrior wouldn't lie there and do nothing!}
<A>__{he kicks madmartigan's boot and knocks his feet off the log.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{we're in trouble! you've seen the big army that's after us! you're a fake! you're a bum! you're a you're a coward!!}
<A>__{he picks up a rock and pitches it wildly at the fire, sending up a shower of sparks. madmartigan eyes him with concern.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{what's with you, peck?}
<A>__{willow lets it all pour out. he begins to cry.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i miss my wife! i miss my chil dren! my boy ranon! he's growing up so fast, he even helps me on the farm now! and little mims! if you ever saw her sweet little face you'd melt madmartigan, you'd melt!}
<P>__{(sniffles)}
<D>__{or maybe you wouldn't. you don't know anything about love. you don't know anything about any thing...}
<A>__{willow sits on the ground, exhausted. madmartigan picks up the baby and sits with her in his lap.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i was in love once, willow. she had a hold on my heart. i could barely function.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{i was a great swordsman! i was knighted! i could have been king!}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{you?}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{yeah me. king! but she betrayed me. she robbed me of my dream.}
<A>__{madmartigan gently rocks the baby and stares at the fire. willow watches him curiously.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i will never fall in love again...}
