<A>__{lost in thought, he buries his face in his hands.}
<C>__{adele's voice }
<D>__{mind if i join you?}
<A>__{luke looks up, squinting. adele stands above him, backlit by the golden light of the sundown.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{she sits next to him. tentatively, she touches his shoulder. he leans into her, and she enfolds her arm in his. pause.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{your father said... that i would start to remember things.}
<A>__{suddenly, adele feels as though she's walking on eggshells.}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(slowly)}

<D>__{delly. i'm... i'm not... harry wasn't my father. and i'm not... i'm not luke.}
<A>__{she closes her eyes. all her suspicions are suddenly confirmed.}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(adrift)}

<A>__{her tears start, and she moves to hug luke but instead, she starts hitting him, flailing, beating on his chest. he hugs her tightly, and she completely lets go.}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{oh, god, i knew! i knew! i knew from the start! i wanted you to be luke! i wanted you to be alive! you're so much like him, you have no idea. no wonder everyone else accepted you! you don't know what you what luke meant to this town, suddenly being alive! you don't know what this town lost! you just don't know...}
