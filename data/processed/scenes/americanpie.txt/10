<L>__{interior dog days late afternoon}
<A>__{a small, nostalgia themed dive. despite the theme, classic rock plays. kevin, oz, jim and finch sit at a table. they munch on hot dogs piled high with condiments.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{you ever hear of something called the bible?}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{once, in church, dude.}
<A>__{jim is paging through great falls' equivalent of the la weekly.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{ooh, here's an easy one: "attractive swf, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." okay..."attractive"...ugly.}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{"fun loving" insane.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no, "charming" is old. "older" is really old. "youthful mind" is dead.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{finch, you can be the one to date a nearly dead insane chick. eat your damn imitation hot dog.}
<C>__{finch}
<P>__{("for the hundredth time")}
<D>__{this is no imitation. removing the hot dog from the ultradog yields a better dog. behold ultradog, no dog.}
<A>__{finch displays the cross section on his hot dog. it's all condiments. the guys react with rehearsed offense.}
<C>__{kevin}
<P>__{(checks his watch)}
<D>__{alright...i'm shooting for a nine o'clock eta. beer in hand by five after.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you can crash at stifler's?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{it's all good.}
<P>__{(he pulls out some gum)}
<D>__{breath check.}
<A>__{he hands out a stick of gum to each guy, automatically skipping finch, who pulls out a small, hotel bottle of scope. gargles with it. spits it into his drink cup.}
<C>__{oz}
<P>__{(repulsed)}
<D>__{dude, i wish you wouldn't do that.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{you got something up your sleeve for tonight, finch?}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{a foolproof plan, my friend. you shall see.}
<A>__{oz has tuned into the song in the background "blinded by the light" [the original springsteen version, not the manfred mann remake].}
<C>__{oz}
<P>__{(sings along)}
<D>__{and little hurly burly came by in her curly wurly, and asked me if i needed i ri hide }
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{how the hell do you know all these random songs?}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{it's early springsteen, dude, this is classic. this was before the cheesy remake.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{this was remade? into what?}
<C>__{oz}
<P>__{(chiming in as the chorus hits)}
<D>__{bli hinded by the light cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{at least now i know what the hell they're saying.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{so, does my hair look better }
<P>__{(flips a small lock of hair onto his forehead)}
<D>__{like this, or...}
<P>__{(flips it back up)}
<D>__{like this?}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{who cares?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{nadia does, that czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. now, do you think she'd prefer }
<P>__{(flips hair down again)}
<D>__{cool hip jim...}
<P>__{(flips it back up)}
<D>__{or laid back jim?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{the difference is so phenomenal, i can't decide.}
