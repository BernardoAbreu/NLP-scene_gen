<A>__{the dinner from hell. geoff splats a helping of mashed potatoes onto his plate, all the while keeping a wary eye on gus... gus is serving himself a chunk of rabbit. it hits the edge of the plate, teetering on the rim. he passes the dish on. gus meets geoff's gaze. for a moment, there's a deadened, vacant look in gus' eyes. then slowly, a limp smile creeps over him, sending a chill up geoff's spine. geoff averts gus' stare. gus helps himself to potatoes and passes the plate on. he lets go of it short of reaching drew. only drew's quick hands save it from hitting the table. amanda comes to the table with a dish of lima beans. she casts gus a cold, hateful stare and sets the limas down. she's still angry over last night. gus dishes a sloppy scoop and passes it toward drew. like before, he lets it drop too early. this time drew doesn't save it. the lima beans shower the floor.}
