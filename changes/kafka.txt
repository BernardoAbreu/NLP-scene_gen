<ACTION>__{PRAGUE - MORNING The Old Town is quiet.  It's very early in the twisted streets of this ancient ghetto.  Dark corners casting a medieval spell over a modern century oblivious to their romance and mystery. The River is the dividing line.  Elegant gardens on the opposite bank embracing the monotonous solemnity of the New Town, tower steeples silhouetted against the sombre sky. An empty motor bus rattles along a deserted street. A Gothic bridge links the two halves of the strange city. Its half-moon arches becoming circles as they meet their reflections in the water.  Thin mist swirls over the cobblestones above. A few boats in the water.  Fishermen casting their lines in silence.  One or two lights now burning in buildings beyond. In the Old Town Square the great clock on the cathedral strikes six.}

<ACTION>__{A MAN'S FACE His eyes filled with terror, beads of sweat crawling on his brow. He stands in the middle of a murky courtyard, perfectly still.  Waiting.  Watching. The balconies overlooking on successive floors, looming all around him, are empty.  All is quiet. The man's name is EDUARD.  He dares not move for fear of missing a single sound.  And then he hears it.  A small noise of movement nearby.  He runs.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{BLACK TUNNEL}
<ACTION>__{Coming out into the light, but by no means out of danger, he allows himself a brief pause, gasping for air, just for a moment looking back into the gloom, starting to retreat again even as he does, then turning running ...}
<ACTION_ALT>__{WINDING STREET}
<ACTION>__{He runs on, past boarded-up houses and shuttered inns, strange relics of the Middle Ages casting frightening shadows.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{AROUND A CORNER}
<ACTION>__{Eduard appears suddenly, quickly flattens himself back against the large notice board that covers the wall here, layers of expressionistic theatre and film posters pasted on it. He breathes painfully in short bursts, as silently as he can.  He watches the corner he's just come from, the ornate archway through which any pursuer must emerge. Nothing there.  But then a shadow moves. Eduard's shoulders tense.  His eyes widen.  He holds his breath. The shadow ... spreading ... Eduard edges away ever so slowly, keeping his unblinking gaze on the archway, backing off, one arm brushing the notice board as he feels his way along it, macabre images on the posters, some torn and incomplete, revealing other fragments behind, Eduard's eyes staring constant, no noise here at all and -- A HAND!  clamps over his face from behind.  All of a sudden and out of absolutely nowhere and not a thing he can do about it. But he tries, his hands coming up to grip the arm that grasps him, an arm of iron. The hand is huge.  It covers Eduard's face almost entirely, only one eye gaping bloodshot through the fingers, ghastly fingers that, just for a second, seem almost inhuman, perhaps even fingers that seem incompatible on the same hand, a hand covered in scar tissue, starting to squeeze as it pulls Eduard swiftly away.}

<ACTION>__{A ROW OF TYPEWRITERS - DAY Clacketing incessantly under slightly more agile and refined fingers.  Beyond these, another row of desks.  And beyond that another, the office workers in their neat suits tapping away. And beyond that another, at which one worker scribbles furiously at his figures, the next rolls a new sheet into his typewriter, the next answers his clanging telephone, the next rifles through the pages of a massive record book, the next sits erect in his chair playing his machine like a piano, and the last, by the window, dusty light streaming across him, contemplatively taps the end of a pencil onto his desk.  This is KAFKA. A rather tall young man with a kind, sensitive face. sensitive perhaps because his eyes, ears, and nose seem slightly bigger and more inquiring than most, and his gaze one of almost unrelenting intensity. He's looking off at something now. A desk, not very far from his own.  But empty.  The chair pushed squarely under it.  The typewriter covered. Kafka is wondering why -- when his concentration is interrupted.}

They're at the river's edge, all running wildly, slipping and stumbling, every man for himself, as they desperately try to escape from whatever madness is closing in behind them. Now from out of the tunnel appears their pursuer, seen only from the back, literally shaking with insane, involuntary, howling LAUGHTER.  A horrific human hyena, far further gone than the sad wretches he's cornered here on this foul, moss-covered ledge in the cold wind. Seeing him, the vagrants freeze in their various positions -- then turn in panic to flee again as he starts after them, moving like an animal, a killer predator, laughing horribly as he goes. The First Vagrant, propelled by fright, manages to make a stunning leap up a wall to grab onto some overhanging chains and pull himself up.  The Second Vagrant finds himself trapped at the edge of the ledge -- with the Laughing Man choosing him as the one to go after first.  He turns and jumps into the river.  The Laughing Man, face still unseen, turns toward the climbing vagrant instead -- who clambers over the top just in time as the Laughing Man's fingernails claw the moldy wall beneath him. The Third Vagrant has made it to some steps, and down them -- glancing back to see the Laughing Man coming after him -- to the small patch of muddy beach at the bottom, grey river water lapping at his ragged shoes.  He doesn't know what to do -- he doesn't know how to swim!  The Laughing Man is running down the steps now.  The Vagrant starts wading out into the water, crying out in fear as the HOWLS behind him come closer and closer -- he throws himself forward, splashing vainly -- and feels the Laughing Man grabbing his ankles, pulling him back. The Vagrant's screams join the Laughing Man's insane giggles as they thrash around violently in the water.  The Laughing Man drags the Vagrant back to the beach, then back up the Steps, the Vagrant struggling helplessly, his head banging from step to step, his hands flailing around but finding nothing to clutch onto, his screaming going unheeded in this lonely part of the sleeping city. The Laughing Man drags him on, back to the slippery ledge and along it, dragging the Vagrant on his back through a filthy sewer alongside the wall, the Vagrant's cries choked by the stagnant water, but continuing as the Laughing Man drags him back into the dark tunnel, under the bridge, the two of them disappearing into the blackness again, their combined SHRIEKING louder than ever as it ECHOES horribly around the damp stone, then dimming as they go deeper and further away, unseen, until the screaming and the laughter can no longer be distinguished.}

Mr. Pick leads the Strange Man down the central quarry to where a third man, a LABORER by the look of him, is waiting. Kafka finds a vantage point somewhere above the central quarry.  He flattens himself on the ground and peers over the edge. In the quarry, Mr. Pick steps back a pace from the Strange Man as they meet up with the Laborer and suddenly grabs the Strange Man, pinning his arms behind him, baring his chest or the Laborer to stab a dagger into! Kafka is shocked by the abruptness of this.  He sees the Strange Man slump to the ground.  He crawls a little closer. He sees the Laborer replace the knife in its sheath on his belt, then help Mr. Pick drag the Strange Man off to some side shadows where they dump him.

<ACTION>__{Kafka giddily staggers forward, one arm wrapped around his bleeding chest, Gabriela close behind him.  Too close for him to get away.  He turns to face her as he reaches the bridge and as she comes upon him again with the knife, raising his arm to block the thrust and hold her wrist back.  She's strong, though, made more so by her madness.  She forces him down to the ground, straddling him, the knife pushing closer.  Kafka gasps in pain, finally succumbs, no longer able to hold his hand up in defense, simply shutting his eyes with a terrible sigh to await the fatal stab. It doesn't come.  Almost.  But not quite.  Gabriela's arm pauses, shaking in the cool, cloudy air, her sleeve trembling in the breeze off the River, the sharp blade, inches from Kafka's throat, flashing in the new day's light. Gabriela stares away over the River, the destroyed half of her face in shadow again, the other more strikingly beautiful than ever.  As Kafka watches, passive, she gets off him and slowly walks to the wall of the bridge, letting the knife drop from her hand along the way.  Kafka manages to lift himself to his knees, clutching his wound.  He looks up. Gabriela in one graceful movement climbs over the wall and throws herself into the River. Kafka lowers his head.}

<ACTION>__{CONTINENTAL COFFEE SHOP - MORNING Quiet in here.  Breakfast business not as crowded as evening.  Kafka sits alone at  his usual table.  Looking dazed, almost in shock.  Mostly just tired.  Waiting.  He sips from his coffee cup.  He COUGHS a little into his napkin -- and notices blood on it. He has a pen in his hand.  Tapping it slowly on a newspaper on the table ... Bizzlebek comes into the coffee house.  He sees Kafka sitting in the far corner and gives a grand smile and wave.  But then he notices Kafka's other friends entering and he'd rather not have to deal with them -- so he gives Kafka a "catch you later" gesture and turns onto his own usual stool at the bar. Kafka stares at his friends over there.  They're taking off their coats and  greeting other people.  The girl, Anna, is the first to start walking to join him. He starts to write, a first line that has occurred to him, the pen moving as if he can't help himself ...}
