<L>__{exterior cider house, roof morning}
<A>__{muddy and hero and peaches are sitting close together on the roof, like banished children. it is from their perspective that we see the police car and the ambulance two men carrying the body out of the cider house, and a cop or two talking to homer and olive, and homer talking to them. we hear no dialogue.}
<L>__{exterior apple mart dusk}
<A>__{homer and the men load crates of apple jelly onto a truck. the mood is solemn; they work with tired focus. candy drives up. the men are evasive with her; they find a reason to work across the mart. candy walks to homer, stands next to him. they say nothing for a moment, until candy breaks the silence.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{do you think she'll be all right?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{she knows how to take care of herself.}
<A>__{candy looks away; she can't think of what to say. she shoves her hands into her pockets, finds a letter there, which she hands to homer.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{this came for you a couple of days ago. olive asked me to bring it. with everything happening, i guess she forgot.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{sure. thanks.}
<A>__{homer looks at the letter from st. cloud's; he puts it unopened in his pocket without a second thought. candy can't let things end there.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{i know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i'm sorry for what i said about wally needing you. it was... unnecessary.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{no, i'm the one who should be sorry. you have every right to be angry.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{no. you warned me. i didn't listen, but you warned me.}
<A>__{candy looks surprised.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{you told me you weren't any good at being alone.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you told wally, too. right?}
<A>__{candy can only stare straight ahead.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(relenting)}
<D>__{he's going to be fine, wally's going to be fine. i know he is.}
<A>__{a tear rolls down candy's cheek, homer wipes it away; then he stops touching her and looks off into the quiet orchards.}
