<D>__{halfway down the spout area is a set of six tungsten steel bars called a grizzly which catch all the rocks too large to make it through the funnel mouth to safe haulage.}

<C>__{pk }
<D>__{these are taken care of by a grizzly, an explosives expert whose job it is to keep the ore flowing, and since when the ore doesn't flow, neither does the money, working the grizzly is a very crucial and therefore very well paid position. three months' work earns a year's stay at oxford. yesterday, on receiving my blasting license from the school of mines, i signed on to work the bars for a year.}
