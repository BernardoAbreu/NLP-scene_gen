<L>__{exterior german camp. later.}
<A>__{two grooms trail brandt, leading joey and topthorn toward a makeshift corral.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{heiglemann these are yours.}
<C>__{friedrich}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{they look strong should last a month or two.}
<A>__{friedrich is an unprepossessing, chubby man. he marvels at topthorn.}
<C>__{friedrich}
<D>__{you are beautiful.}
<A>__{but then he looks to the other horses penned nearby, haggard and weak. he turns to joey.}
<C>__{friedrich }
<D>__{it's a pity they found you.}
<A>__{he takes the leads of the pair of them. he sighs...}
<C>__{friedrich }
<D>__{such a pity...}
<A>__{in a strange way, there are many humans joey meets, but also just one, the spirit of goodness and consideration for animals, joined by little echoes throughout the film. and then they go over a ridge and we suddenly see the explanation of friedrich's comment. the road they can see below them is the main through road of the area and it is a scene of horse horror huge, massive guns and cannons and artillery being dragged by teams of horses that are in a terrible condition. for joey and topthorn, this is a moment like when soldiers arrived to liberate the prisoners who had been kept in changi prison by the japanese during world war 2. they have never seen horses in this condition. you can see in their eyes the confusion. this is a whole different world, where horses can turn into creatures that look like this. and it is also a vision of their future. this may be the moment the mighty topthorn begins to lose hope. for joey it is another level of knowledge another mighty thing he will fight through because he always fights through.}
