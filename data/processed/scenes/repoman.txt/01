<P>__{(continues softly)}
<A>__{otto starts car and guns engine, but now we clearly see that the rear wheels are up on jacks (that it wasn't up on jacks before has been listed as a goof and even confirmed by alex cox, but i think they're wrong. it is hard to tell in the dark, but you can see the base of one of the jacks lit up by a light from the house which goes dark as a band member runs in front of it on the other side of the car, thus confirming that the car actually was up on jacks in all the scenes). band members run out of house and pull otto out of car.}
<C>__{otto}
<D>__{hey it's cool. it's cool. i like music too man, hey}
<A>__{otto gets beat up. one band member hits him twice over the head with a guitar, making an audible "kabong" noise. supposedly you can hear one member saying "this one's for keith moon", but i've never been able to make it out. miller, plettschner and otto in the lot. miller is chanting and dancing like a native american as he puts a bandage on otto's head.}
