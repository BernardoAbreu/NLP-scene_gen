<A>__{can take you over here. gene is dragged forward. he looks around; no way out. he stands, expectant, as the detector slides down one side of his body, is lifted over to the other. down it slides, toward the pocket concealing the gun. gene waits for the alarm which doesn't come. the security man operating the gizmo deftly switches it off as it passes the weapon. gene is pushed on, looking back, confused, alarmed, finds himself among: press by the dozens. eleanor samara grant supporters by the hundreds. security men and cops in uniform. gene moves through them, trying to figure out what just happened. he glances back to the 2nd security man, and bumps into one particular police officer, plain clothes, badge in pocket, who reacts with a quick laugh. police officer easy, sir. got to watch where you're going in a crowd like this. he is a handsome, solid looking guy. you'd trust him. call him officer trust. officer trust seems to be in charge. he moves off through the crowd, giving local police orders in an easy way. gene looks around. he can't see mr. smith. he edges his way after officer trust, who reaches the wall beyond which is the drop to the street. he leans there comfortably, scanning the crowd, gene reaches the wall a few yards away from him. he looks out at the city, getting his courage up. just as he turns to approach officer trust:}
<C>__{mr. smith }
<D>__{i know what you're thinking.}
<A>__{gene freezes! mr. smith appears from the crowd, joins him. he smugly flips his walkie talkie into the air, catches it.}

<D>__{me?}
<A>__{he flips the walkie talkie, catches it.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{the bitch would be dead. course i ain't sayin' which bitch.}
<A>__{he flips the walkie talkie. gene lashes out, smacks the walkie talkie. it sails over the edge, falls and smashes onto the sidewalk four stories below. mr. smith goes ballistic. gene walks away from him right up to officer trust.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{there's a plot to kill the governor. if you don't believe me, check that guy right there. he has a gun.}
<A>__{officer trust looks at mr. smith and then at gene.}

<A>__{he grabs gene and gives him a push. there is a general movement in the crowd toward the platform. gene is buffeted along. mr. smith follows him, keeping him in sight, but then a pack of photographers move in, start snapping, lifting their cameras high to shoot over the crowd. mr. smith instinctively turns away, hiding his face. he moves around the photogs and finds himself separated from gene by the mob. he searches, trying to spot him.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{angle on gene 12:4 6pm in the crowd, gene is bumped this way and that. his face displays an inner devastation. his eyes focus desperately on something ahead: it is the back of eleanor grant's head. she is turning this way and that, greeting supporters. gene's hand slides into his pocket, grips the gun. he is at the end of his rope. he is going to do it.}
