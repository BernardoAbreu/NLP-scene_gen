<L>__{interior booth coffee shop night (later)}
<A>__{the remains of a fried clam sandwich sit before james as he turns his attention to a giant piece of lemon meringue pie. grady sips only coffee, stealing glances at the cars that whip by on the highway beyond the window.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{want a bite?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{that's why you're having them. your spells.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{spells? jesus, james, you make it sound like we're in a tennessee williams play. i don't have spells.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{what would you call them then?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i don't know. ...'episodes.'}
<A>__{james shrugs, spears a fluffy chunk of pie.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{it's because you don't eat.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i eat.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{when nobody's looking.}
<A>__{grady watches a pair of headlights approach...}
<C>__{james leer}
<P>__{(mouth full, garbled)}
<D>__{i just worry about you, that's all.}
<A>__{...then pass. james' words finally register. grady looks at him.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{you just worry about yourself, james. okay?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{just then, a long, pale wand of light splinters against the coffee shop windows and a car sweeps into the parking lot. grady follows it with his eyes, rises.}
<C>__{james leer }
<D>__{where you going?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{nowhere. you just sit here and... eat.}
<A>__{grady moves off, then stops, looking back at james and his giant piece of pie, still troubled by his words.}
