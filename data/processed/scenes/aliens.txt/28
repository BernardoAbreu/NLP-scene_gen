<A>__{ripley lunges into frame with an animal outcry. she clutches her chest, breathing hard. bathed in sweat she lights a cigarette with trembling hands. do we hear a faint, desolate wind? tight on phone console as ripley's hand inserts burke's card into a slot.

<D>__{yello? oh, ripley. hi...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{burke, just tell me one thing. that you're going out there to kill them. not study. not bring back. just burn them out...clean ...forever.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{that's the plan. my word on it.}

<C>__{ripley}
