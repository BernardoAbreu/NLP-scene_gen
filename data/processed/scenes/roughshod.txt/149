<L>__{into the meadow. steve has unpacked the horses. they graze}
<A>__{inside the crude corral. steve is collecting wood for a fire. clay hurries down toward him.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{steve squats beside the pile of needles, twigs and pine cones. he strikes a match and sets the needles aflame. clay hurries into the scene and roughly kicks the fire out. steve rises.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{if you want 'em to find us, why don't you go up on the hill and wave your shirt or fire your rifle.}
<A>__{steve is ashamed of his thoughtlessness and for a moment is apologetic.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i didn't stop to think, clay.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(short)}
<D>__{you better start.}
<A>__{clay turns and goes over to where the packs lie. he kneels beside the pack, rummages in them for hardtack and tinned food. steve looks after him.}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{steve. he is hurt and angry. knowing he was in the wrong about the fire doesn't help matters. he'd like to go off in the woods and cry, but that's out of the question. instead he follows clay and stands above him.}
<B>__{med. close shot}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{maybe you and me better split up when we hit sonora.}
<A>__{clay speaks without looking up.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(mildly)}
<D>__{all right, i hurt your feelings. but you know better than to go lightin' fires.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{that ain't why. i just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.}
<A>__{clay spreads the food on a tarp, sits down and starts eating a hardtack.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{maybe you're not hungry, but i am.}
<A>__{steve stares down at him angrier, more hurt than ever.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{come on. we got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i will eat when i'm good and ready.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{kind of feeling your oats this morning. i haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what makes you think you're so almighty? telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.}
<A>__{[as this scene continues, there is heard, faintly o.s. the sound of little bells, the kind that teamsters put on the hames of their horses. over the hill, in the direction of yosemite, a stage is approaching. it is coming slowly uphill. soon it will be visible on the rise about a mile south of the meadow.]}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{shooting toward steve and clay past mary. she is asleep.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you ain't even man enough to own up when you're wrong.}
<A>__{clay rises and stands facing steve.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{go on, hit me.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{sit down and eat. till i say the word, you're doing what you're told.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you oughta say you're sorry that's what you oughta do.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you keep your nose out of my life, young fella.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{maybe i haven't lived as long as you have, but i know a sight more about people and i wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if i did, i'd say how sorry i was. i'd be man enough to do that.}
<A>__{steve's voice rises during this speech. in f.g. mary stirs and opens her eyes. then she sits up.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i said keep your nose out of my life. no kid is going to tell me how to run it.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you think you're so slmighty smart who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday just because a man kisses a woman }
<A>__{mary has risen. she is listening to steve. she is also listening to the bells.}
<B>__{long shot}
<A>__{her angle. over the rise comes the stage. it is still a long way off.}
<C>__{steve's voice}
<D>__{ doesn't mean he wants to marry her.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{to include all three. the brothers still don't see mary.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{well, if you didn't mean it, why did you kiss her?}
<A>__{clay is ashamed but won't show it. he puts his hand on steve's shoulder and pushes him.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{shut up and eat.}
<A>__{steve swings for his chin. clay ducks the blow, grabs steve's wrist. steve swings with his left, hitting clay ineffectually. clay pins steve's arms to his side.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{stop it both of you.}
<A>__{she walks toward them as clay releases steve and steps back. steve puts his hands up, making ready for another round.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i won't have you fighting over me.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(to steve)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you don't know what it is to be sorry.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(sharp)}
<D>__{steve }
<A>__{steve turns abruptly and moves away. he is on the verge of tears.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(to clay)}
<D>__{mind sortin' out my things i'm leaving.}
<A>__{she motions off. clay is suddenly aware of the approaching stage. he looks in that direction.}
<B>__{long shot}
<A>__{from his angle. the stage drives along the road.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{maybe it isn't going to sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it's going to sonora.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{fine maybe i will see you there sometime.}
<A>__{she turns and starts going through the kyacks, looking for her things. clay frowns down at her.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{because as you said, that's where i belong.}
<A>__{mary's attention is on the kyacks. from where clay stands near her he can see the trail leading down through open country toward the meadow.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i said a lot of things some of 'em }
<A>__{something o.s. catches his attention, then he pauses to look off.}
