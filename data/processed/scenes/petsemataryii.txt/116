<A>__{geoff and drew have parked their bikes beneath the bridge. they sit on the bank of the creek below, watching the water run past. geoff is lost in thought.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{do you think everyone that came back would be like gus?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...}
<C>__{geoff}
<P>__{(finishing)}
<D>__{dies?}
<A>__{drew nods. he tosses a stone into the creek, then looks up at the sun and sighs.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i gotta go back and do my chores...}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{go later...}
<A>__{drew shakes his head.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i can't. gus'd kill me if i showed up late.}
<A>__{the boys reluctantly rise and move to their bikes, walking them up the steep grade to the highway.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{see you at school monday?}
<A>__{geoff nods. he looks at drew. the boy is genuinely frightened. but there's nothing either of them can do. they're trapped in their roles as kids. both boys mount their bikes. drew turns...}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you ever think about running away?}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{all the time.}
<A>__{drew smiles at this. he waves to geoff and pedals off.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(calling back)}
<D>__{see ya!}
<A>__{geoff waves and heads off in the opposite direction. we stay on drew as he moves down the road. up ahead, we hear the approaching whine of a motorcycle...}
<B>__{clyde}
<A>__{rips by on an old junkyard fixer up motorcycle, and he's heading in geoff's direction. seeing him, drew brakes and pulls his bike into a u turn, pumping furiously to catch up with geoff. on geoff now geoff hears the whine of clyde's motorcycle. he glances back... clyde's spotted him, revving the engine. geoff pedals like mad, but it's no use. clyde is closing in on him, grinning sadistically. clyde sweeps in next to him, calling out over the engine.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{well look who's here!}
<A>__{clyde veers right, forcing geoff towards the shoulder of the road...}
