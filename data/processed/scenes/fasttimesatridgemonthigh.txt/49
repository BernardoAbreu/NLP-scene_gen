<L>__{interior carl's jr. counter}
<A>__{brad stands at the register. we see a prominent display over brad's head: try our 100% guaranteed breakfast. the last of many harried businessmen customers gets his breakfast order and takes his seat. brad is joined by dennis taylor, the assistant manager.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{come on. clean that counter off brad. let's go. play ball.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{okay, dennis.}
<A>__{brad begins polishing the counter and dennis taylor returns to his office at the back of the kitchen. brad watches him disappear behind the door that says: assistant manager. as soon as dennis disappears behind the door, the one businessman in the place rises and returns to the counter.}
<C>__{brad }
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{may i help you?}
<A>__{the businessman has short, curly brown hair. he speaks in a whine.}
<C>__{businessman}
<D>__{yes. this is not the best breakfast i ever ate.}
<A>__{the businessman points to the huge display over brad's head: try our 100% guaranteed breakfast.}
<C>__{businessman }
<D>__{and i want my money back.}
<A>__{brad begins searching under the counter.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{well, i believe you have to fill out a form. there's a pad right around here.}

<D>__{no. i want my money back right now.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{well, that's not the way it works, really. and you ate most of your food already, too...}
<C>__{businessman}
<D>__{see that sign? it says 100% money back guarantee. do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? do they teach you that here? give me my money back.}
<A>__{brad begins looking to the restroom. "where's arnold?"}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{i can't do that. but if you wait a minute...}
<C>__{businessman}
<P>__{(as if talking to a kindergartner)}
<D>__{look. just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. okay?}
<P>__{(looks at name tag)}
<D>__{please, brad?}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir. just let me find the forms here.}
<C>__{businessman}
<D>__{i am so tired. i am so tired of dealing with morons. how hard is it to...}
<A>__{brad looks up from under the counter. no amount of pay will make him take that kind of insult.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{mister, if you don't shut up, i'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.}
<C>__{businessman}
<D>__{manager!!}
<A>__{"bam!" the door to the assistant manager's office swings open, and dennis comes hurtling out of the back.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{can i help you, sir? is there a problem?}
<C>__{businessman}
<D>__{you bet there's a problem! your employee used profanity and threatened me with violence! i'm shocked, frankly. i've eaten here many times and i've always enjoyed the service until today!}
<A>__{angle on bathroom door as it opens and arnold starts towards the register. he quickly sees the incident with the irate businessman and ducks back inside the bathroom.}
<C>__{businessman }
<D>__{all i wanted was my money back for this breakfast. it was a little undercooked. and this young man threatened me. now i plan to write a letter! i plan to...}
<A>__{dennis wheels around to brad.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{he insulted me first. he called me a moron.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{you're fired.}
<A>__{brad looks around, expecting his friends to defend him. dave and rich seem very occupied with their work. brad is stunned.}
<C>__{dennis }
<P>__{(to businessman)}
<D>__{i'm very sorry this happened to you, sir.}
<C>__{businessman}
<D>__{thank you very much.}
<A>__{then brad unhooks his fryer's apron and throws it on the counter. he grabs a backpack and walks out of the place. on the way, he bangs the bathroom door with his fist.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{i hope you had a hell of a piss, arnold.}
