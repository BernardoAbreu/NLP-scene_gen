<L>__{exterior barton church. day.}
<A>__{mrs jennings is talking to the elderly curate. other parishioners exit the church as willoughby's curricle (the eighteenth century equivalent of a sports car) goes flying by. marianne sits by his side, the picture of happiness. mrs jennings nudges the curate and whispers. the parishioners stare after them and comment to each other.}
<L>__{exterior barton cottage garden path day}
<A>__{marianne and elinor are coming down the path together. marianne is dressed to go out. the argument has evidently started indoors and is being continued here.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{if there was any true impropriety in my behaviour, i should be sensible of it, elinor }
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{but as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks, do you not begin to doubt your own discretion?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{if the impertinent remarks of such as mrs jennings are proof of impropriety, then we are all offending every moment of our lives }
<A>__{the conversation is halted by the arrival of colonel brandon on horseback.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<P>__{(dismounting)}
<D>__{miss dashwood! miss marianne!}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{good morning, colonel!}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{i come to issue an invitation. a picnic on my estate at delaford if you would care to join us on thursday nexterior mrs jennings's daughter and her husband are traveling up especially.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{thank you, colonel, we shall be delighted.}
<A>__{at that moment, willoughby's curricle hoves into view and marianne's face lights up.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<P>__{(to marianne)}
<D>__{i will of course be including mr willoughby in the party.}
<A>__{even marianne is a little embarrassed and recollects her manners. she smiles kindly at brandon.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i should be delighted to join you, colonel!}
<A>__{the colonel helps her into the curricle, exchanging nods with willoughby, who is regarding him with some suspicion.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{good morning, miss dashwood; good morning, colonel.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{the colonel has invited us to delaford, willoughby!}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{excellent. i understand you have a particularly fine pianoforte, colonel.}
<A>__{the undercurrents of this conversation are decidedly tense.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{a broadwood grand.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{a broadwood grand! then i shall really be able to play for you!}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{we shall look forward to it!}
<A>__{marianne smiles her perfect happiness at him and he whips up the horses. they drive off, waving their farewells. brandon looks after them for a silent moment, and then collects himself and turns to elinor, who is less than satisfied with their behaviour.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{your sister seems very happy.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{yes. marianne does not approve of hiding her emotions. in fact, her romantic prejudices have the unfortunate tendency to set propriety at naught.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{she is wholly unspoilt.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{rather too unspoilt, in my view. the sooner she becomes acquainted with the ways of the world, the better.}
<A>__{colonel brandon looks at her sharply and then speaks very deliberately, as though controlling some powerful emotion.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{i knew a lady like your sister the same impulsive sweetness of temper who was forced into, as you put it, a better acquaintance with the world. the result was only ruination and despair.}
<A>__{he stops, and briskly remounts his horse.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{do not desire it, miss dashwood.}
