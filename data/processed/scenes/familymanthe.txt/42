<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{thanks, man...}
<A>__{jack gets out of the car...and before he can even turn around, cashs door slams shut and the car takes off in a blast of horsepower... jack stands there gazing down the street, listening to the sound of the ferrari shifting gears, disappearing... the wind whips up...shivering, jack looks toward the lassiter building, then to the plastic bag in his hand, and finally to the mini van.}
