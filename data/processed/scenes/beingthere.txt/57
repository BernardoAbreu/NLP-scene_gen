<L>__{interior rand dining room night}
<A>__{thurmand, a waiter, and marianne, a waitress, enter into the rand dining room carrying trays of food. the dining room is immense, a 70 foot ceiling, huge fireplace. allenby, eve, rand, and chance (both in wheelchairs) sit around the table. rand speaks slowly, with obvious weakness.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{i know exactly what you mean. today the businessman is at the mercy of kid lawyers from the sec. all they want to do is regulate our natural growth! it's happening across the country!}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{to everyone, i'm afraid. the government controls are so restricting that the medical profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{of course! by kid lawyers!}
<A>__{eve turns to chance.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, mr. gardiner?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{no. it won't do that.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{... would you like us to notify anyone for you?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{no. the old man died and louise left.}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{oh. i'm very sorry. well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{do you need a secretary?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{no, thank you. my house has been closed.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{oh. when you say 'your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. shut down and locked by the attorneys.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{what'd i tell you? kid lawyers! the s.e.c.! damn them!}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{no. i like it here.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{that's good, mr. gardiner. or may i call you chauncey?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(agreeable to being called chauncey)}
<D>__{yes. chauncey is fine.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{and i'm ben.}
<C>__{allenby}
<P>__{(smiles to chance)}
<D>__{... and please call me robert.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes, robert. i will.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{so tell me, chauncey, what are your plans now?}
<A>__{chance looks around the room.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{does this house have a garden?}
<A>__{allenby gives chance a look.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{do we have a garden? hah! tomorrow, chauncey, you will see our gardens.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i see. i would like to work in your garden.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{oh, i know exactly what you mean. i sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i am a very good gardener.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{a gardener! well put, chauncey excellent! isn't that what a businessman is? a gardener? a person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? yes, chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{thank you, ben. the garden that i left was such a place. everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. i planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.}
<C>__{rand}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{bravo!}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{but i don't have that any more...}
<P>__{(points to ceiling)}
<D>__{... all that's left for me now is the room upstairs.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{now, wait a minute, chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for god's sake don't give up on yourself! you have to fight! you can't let those bastards keep you down! i don't want to hear any more from you about the 'room upstairs'. that's where i'm going soon.}
<A>__{there is a long pause. chance looks up, then smiles at rand.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{it's a very pleasant room, ben.}
<C>__{rand}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{yes, i'm sure it is. that's what they say, anyway.}
<A>__{another period of silence. the servants bustle around the room as allenby studies chance.}
