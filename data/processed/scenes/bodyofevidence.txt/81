<A>__{the dim glow of a desk lamp is the only source of light. dulaney moves through the room slowly.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{rebecca?}
<A>__{two champagne bottles are on the floor by the couch. dulaney looks on the coffee table. his pov coffee table a vial is open and on its side. a razor blade and straw lay next to it. a pile of white powder has been dumped out. several lines of cocaine have been drawn. dulaney starts to move towards the living room. he is almost at the door when the big screen television turns on. we see the tape of dulaney and rebecca making love.}
<C>__{rebecca }
<D>__{is this what you're looking for, frank?}
<A>__{dulaney turns around to find rebecca standing behind him, a remote control in her hand.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(distant)}
<D>__{you killed him. you killed him and i got you off.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{that's crazy.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{is it? joanne braslow was perfect, wasn't she? you knew we'd see her on the tape and find out about her coke problem. after that, the digging should have been easy but we missed the will. you knew we were following her, so you called koehler and had him contact her. that put us right back on track. all we needed then was to prove that she had an opportunity. the drug store took care of that. she dropped off the stuff and you came back and killed him. didn't you?}
<A>__{she shrugs her shoulders. his frustration clearly amuses her. she grins slightly, almost taunting him.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i want the tape.}

<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i've been thinking about that. i've decided to give it to you after i've collected the inheritance. you can take that one if you want but there's another copy.}

<D>__{that wasn't the deal.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(provoking him)}
<D>__{so, sue me.}
<P>__{(as cold as ice)}
<D>__{things have changed. i think you should go home and after you leave i see no reason for us to ever have contact again.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(growing angrier)}
<D>__{i'm not leaving without that tape.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{don't push me, frank. i might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.}
<A>__{dulaney loses control.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you fuckin' bitch!}
<A>__{he grabs her by the shoulders and pushes her into the wall. rebecca struggles, but it is little use he is a man consumed with rage. dulaney continues to smash her into the wall. rebecca reaches onto the desk lifts up a fountain pen and stabs it into dulaney's shoulder at the base of his neck. dulaney screams and lets go. rebecca starts to runs into the living room. dulaney follows.}
