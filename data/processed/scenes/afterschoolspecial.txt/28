<D>__{oh, my god. there's naomi.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{she looks good.}
<A>__{and there's naomi, every teenage boy's fantasy, wearing a hot party dress and drinking a cup of beer. someone lightly bumps her... close on her lips as the beer dribbles down her chin, and the world goes still . she playfully wipes the beer off her moistened lips and chin with the back of her hand. she turns her head and her hair floats in the air.}
<B>__{deacon and fred}
<A>__{are zombies, completely mesmerized by her.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{she spilled her beer.}
<C>__{deacon}

<C>__{fred}
<D>__{your dignity?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{she's rachael's friend. it's not like i don't know her.}
