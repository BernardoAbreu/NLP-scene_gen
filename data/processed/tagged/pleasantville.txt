<C>__{david}
<D>__{sure. everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.}
<A>__{there's a murmur in the gallery.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{wouldn't it feel better than when they used to win all the time?}
<A>__{there is a louder murmur. big bob looks concerned.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{see, i know you want it to stay "pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like silly ... or sexy ... or dangerous ... or wild ... or brief ...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.}
<P>__{(pointing to the "colored" section)}
<D>__{look at those faces back there. they're no different than you are. they just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{okay that's enough!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i thought i was allowed to defend myself.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you're not allowed to lie.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm not lying ... here i will show you.}
<A>__{he turns suddenly toward the jury box.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{mr. simpson ...}
<C>__{mr. simpson}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what color is that hedge of yours?}
<C>__{mr. simpson}
<D>__{green.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no, not that hedge. the other one.}
<C>__{mr. simpson}
<D>__{the other one?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the one in your mind. the one that you see on a bright cold morning. the one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.}
<A>__{mr. simpson suddenly looks far away. he gets a kind of dreamy look in his eye.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{what color is that hedge?}
<B>__{close up. mr. simpson.}
<A>__{suddenly and before our eyes, mr. simpson turns to living color. a huge murmur moves through the courtroom. bob bangs the gavel.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i said, that's enough!}
<C>__{various voices from}
<C>__{the audience}
<D>__{"no ... let him finish ... go on ..."}
<A>__{big bob lifts the gavel and is about to bang it when david suddenly turns toward george.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{alright. dad ...}
<B>__{different angle.}
<A>__{there is a louder murmur. big bob just looks at him frozen while david confronts his "father." george straightens up.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(solemn)}
<D>__{yes bud.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{don't you miss her?}
<B>__{close up. george.}
<A>__{he looks at him stunned. big bob bangs the gavel but nobody listens. george just stares at him like he got shot.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i mean, of course you do, but it isn't just the cooking or the cleaning that you miss it's something else, isn't it ...}
<A>__{george swallows. the undertone in the room starts to grow as he glances toward the back of the room.}
<C>__{david }
<P>__{(softer whisper)}
<D>__{maybe you can't even describe it. maybe you only know it when it's gone. maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{you might even call it "love."}
<C>__{big bob}
<P>__{(banging the gavel loudly)}
<D>__{okay, that's it!!!}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(motioning toward the back)}
<D>__{now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?}
<A>__{slowly, almost imperceptibly george nods. a single tear rolls down his cheek. as it traces the side of his face it leaves a long trail of color behind it.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{don't you wish you could tell her that?}
<A>__{he nods again and it all comes out. betty smiles at him through her tears. even mr. johnson smiles as well.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(pounding the gavel)}
<D>__{you're out of order!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why am i out of order?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{because i will not allow you to turn this courtroom into a circus!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well i don't think it's a circus. and i don't think they do either.}
<A>__{david motions behind him to the black and white section. there are now ten to fifteen "colored" faces.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{this behavior will stop at once.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{but see that's just the pointerior it can't stop at once. because it's in you. and you can't stop something that's in you.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(tightly)}
<D>__{it's not in me.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh sure it is.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{no it isn't.}
<A>__{he crosses to the bench looking right up at big bob. he leans over the bench and gets right up in his face.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(smug whisper)}
<D>__{what do you want to do to me right now?}
<A>__{big bob starts to tremble. he shakes with rage as david moves closer.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{c'mon. everyone's turning colors. kids are making out in the street. no one's getting their dinner hell, you could have a flood any minute ... pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...}
<C>__{big bob}
<D>__{that's not going to happen!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{but it could happen.}
<C>__{big bob}
<D>__{no it couldn't!}
<A>__{big bob looks at david and starts to tremble. it starts around the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of his head. after a moment or two, big bob has gone completely}
<B>__{red in the face. wider.}
<A>__{a gasp goes through the courtroom. david looks at him and just smiles. the crowd reaction turns almost to a roar as big bob turns and catches his reflection in the window.}
<B>__{close up. big bob.}
<A>__{he sees the ruddy image staring back at him, then looks down at his hands. they have gone completely red as well. big bob freezes for an instant then bolts from the bench in panic and flees the room flinging open the doors to the courtroom.}
<B>__{angle. doorway.}
<A>__{as big bob flees, he reveals an amazing sight: the town square glistens in living color. the huge lawn is a rich deep green. the sky is a dense opaque blue. dozens of spectators bolt from their seats and rush to the doorway as the crowd moves outside.}
<L>__{exterior pleasantville. (full color!)}
<A>__{all the birds are really chirping. red brick, yellow cars, green hats ... the barber pole in front of gus' has finally turned to red, white and blue he can't help smiling. david walks out into the sunlight and stares in wonder at his creation. the whole town is washed in joy.}
<B>__{wider.}
<A>__{margaret comes up and throws her arms around him. they meet in a rich passionate kiss (in direct defiance of the code of conduct). several people around them actually clap, like spectators at a wedding. jennifer moves up next to them and looks at her brother making out.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{uch ... i am like gonna hurl ...}
<A>__{david turns and looks at her. both of them laugh. david throws his arms around his sister as more and more people stream out of the courtroom into the sunlight ...}

<L>__{exterior main street. day.}
<A>__{david and jennifer stand together on the edge of town. she clutches a valise in her hand. he holds the remote control.}

<D>__{i told you. i'm like positive.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{this thing works. we could go home right now.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i'm not ready yet. i gotta do this for a little while.}
<B>__{wider.}
<A>__{they stand on the edge of town (which finally has an edge). a large sign says: "springfield 12 miles" and for the first time, the end of main street is no longer the beginning. jennifer is dressed in mary sue's clothes with a little bit of style thrown in. rich fields of wheat spread out in the distance.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{besides. you think there's like a chance i'm gonna get into college back there?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(thinks ...)}
<D>__{honestly ... no.}

<C>__{david}
<D>__{and you're sure about this?}

<D>__{i've done the slut thing, david. it's really kinda old.}
<A>__{david nods.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i will come back and check on you in a month.}
<A>__{jennifer nods and gives him a hug. she holds on tight for a couple of seconds.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you're like the coolest brother in the world.}
<A>__{david smiles. never been called cool before. they suddenly hear the sound of a motor and look to their left. a huge greyhound bus lumbers up the highway, pulling to a halt at the sign. the doors open beckoning her in. jennifer smiles at her brother, then turns toward the door ...}
<L>__{exterior margarets house. day.}
<A>__{she clutches her umbrella at her side. david holds a bag of oatmeal cookies. each one clings on to the other one's clothing. their faces are inches apart.}

<C>__{david}
<D>__{no i won't. i swear.}
<A>__{margaret nods. she looks at him for a moment then wraps her arms around his neck. they meet in a long, rich, wet, soft kiss. the umbrella falls to the ground ...}

<C>__{david}
<D>__{i like it too.}
<L>__{interior parker living room.}
<A>__{david stands in front of the television with mr. johnson at his side. he holds the remote control in his hand. mr. johnson seems pretty amazed at the whole idea.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you're gonna keep painting aren't you?}
<A>__{mr. johnson nods.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{well ...}
<A>__{he nods again and thinks about it. they smile at each other one last time.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<P>__{(remembering something)}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(reaching into his pocket)}
<D>__{i've got something for you.}

<B>__{insert. paper.}
<A>__{it is a small painted replica of their mural in the same vibrant colors. everything is scaled perfectly, exactly like the one on the wall.}
<B>__{shot. david.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's beautiful.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{just a little you know.}

<D>__{and ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{... it's a pretty short trip.}
<A>__{she nods as well. betty puts the sweater around his shoulders anyway and fusses with the collar for a second or two. then she throws her arms around his neck.}

<D>__{i'm so proud of you, bud.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{thanks ... i love you.}

<A>__{he stands in the middle of the living room looking at his new old surroundings. everything is the same as it was. the black onyx coffee table. the clean burbur rug. the big screen tv in its sleek black cabinet. david looks at it and smiles. the place is inadvertantly in black and white.}
<B>__{closer.}
<A>__{he reaches forward and turns on the tv (by hand) flipping around the dial. jerry springer is berating a prostitute ... tony robbins hawks self improvement in an infomercial ... court tv is doing an o.j. recap. david unfolds mr. johnson's sketch and glances down at it. he smiles to himself. a different kind of nostalgia ...}
