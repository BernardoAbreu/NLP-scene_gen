<A>__{with the uptown skyline behind him, peter casts caution to the wind and leaps from rooftop to rooftop. watching from the street, the man in the loud sportcoat follows peter's progress. peter leaps to a brownstone and lands amid the wash. he leaps up to a tenement and lands on a billboard across which he does a "bug crawl" and leaps again. he touches down on a pigeon coop and bounds up and out of frame again. the coop owner, a latino in an undershirt and a yankees cap, comes running out of the coop. he's so surprised that he leaves the door open and twenty white morning doves fly away in a furious flapping, free at last. the latino lets out a stream of hispanic expletives complete with all the appropriately obscene gestures. peter slides down a cable to a lamp post, and swirls down the pole to a phone booth.}
