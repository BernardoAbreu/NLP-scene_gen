<L>__{exterior desert night}
<A>__{the spacecraft passes over the top of the helicopter. the whirling downdraft emanating from the spaceship's underbelly yanks the cobra away from jenny and the star man and whips it into a spin which gets faster and faster until it disintegrates and falls to the desert floor.}
<L>__{exterior desert night}
<A>__{jenny and the star man shield their faces against the dust storm that billows under the whining descent of the spacecraft. it settles into a landing across the dirt road resting on its three pods. with a crack, a cone of bright white light blasts from the underside.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i must go.}
<A>__{jenny nods.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{what do i do now?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'}
<A>__{the star man puts his arms around her and holds her tight.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(her head on his shoulder)}
<D>__{i'm never going to see you again, am i?}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he kisses the tears out of her eyes, then full on the mouth.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{the star man steps back and places a hand on jenny's stomach.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{tell the baby about me.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i will.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{he turns from her and walks to his ship. jenny watches him go, then remembers something.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{wait!!}
<A>__{she gets the webster's dictionary and the columbia history of the world from the camaro and runs to the star man. he takes them and kisses her again.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{thank you, jennyhaydn.}
<A>__{jenny backs away as the star man walks under the ship into the white light. he waves one last time to jenny and is swallowed into the ship by the light.}
