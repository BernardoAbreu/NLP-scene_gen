<L>__{interior funeral home. eliot's room day}
<A>__{eliot watches intently as anna drives away.}
<L>__{interior restaurant evening}
<A>__{paul sits at a window table. it's raining hard outside. he glances at his watch then nervously checks his pockets. pulls out a ring box. he looks at it for a moment then slips it back into his pocket. as he refills his glass, anna appears outside holding her raincoat above her head. she stares at paul for a moment through the window marbled with rain. paul suddenly notices anna at the window. he starts. spills some of his red wine on his shirt. close on the red stain. it unfurls like a flower. spreading out over the white material.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{sorry about that.}
<A>__{paul dabs the stain with a napkin.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you scared the life out of me.}
<A>__{anna laughs as she sits down. paul looks up at her.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{your hair.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you don't like it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i didn't say that. it's just very... red. i mean it's not really you is it?}
<A>__{a waiter appears at the table before anna can reply.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{are you ready to order?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes. we'll have the duck.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what? you always have the duck here.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(picks up the menu)}
<D>__{i don't always have the duck.}
<A>__{paul shrugs. pours anna some wine as she looks through the menu. the waiter taps his pen on his pad impatiently. anna sighs. puts the menu aside.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i will have the duck.}
<A>__{paul smiles as the waiter leaves. anna tries to ignore him. but after a second she can't help smiling back.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the duck is very good.}
<A>__{anna's smile broadens. the tension between them broken for the moment. paul reaches across. touches her hand.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{let's not argue tonight. ok?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{anna takes a sip of wine.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{this is good.}
<A>__{she picks up the bottle. checks the label.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{and looks very expensive...}
<P>__{(smiles questioningly)}
<D>__{what's the special occasion?}
<A>__{paul's momentarily thrown. he tries to cover it by rearranging his napkin. anna notices.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(suddenly very serious)}
<D>__{actually there is something i need to talk to you about.}
<A>__{now anna's nervous.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i've been offered a transfer to head office in chicago.}
<A>__{anna looks down. stares at her hands on the table.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it'll mean more work of course. more responsibility. a lot of changes. but it's an incredible opportunity. i'd be crazy to turn it down. and...}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{...well i've been thinking. maybe it's time for us to...}
<A>__{paul pauses as he reaches inside his jacket.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{you're going to leave me.}
<A>__{paul's stunned. speechless. before he can say anything }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you could've just told me this morning. you didn't need to buy me off with an expensive meal.}
<A>__{paul reaches for her hand. anna gets up to leave.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{anna wait.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{why did you lie to me? you promised everything was going to be ok.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(increasingly frustrated)}
<D>__{don't be ridiculous. anna. you've got it all wrong.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm not being ridiculous. why do you always talk to me like i'm a small child?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(as if talking to a small child)}
<D>__{anna.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{see? there you go again. do you know how irritating that is?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(loses it)}
<D>__{jesus. can't we just have one fucking meal without arguing }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{the other diners turn and stare at them. paul glances at them embarrassed. anna doesn't notice. upset.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{keep your voice down, everyone's watching.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you're crazy. you know that? just like your mother.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm nothing like my mother!}
<A>__{anna grabs her coat. pushes her way through the restaurant.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(stands)}
<D>__{i'm not running after you this time anna.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{paul's suddenly aware that everyone's looking at him. he quickly sits down. drains his glass of wine. furious.}
