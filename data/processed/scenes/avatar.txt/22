<C>__{crew chief}
<D>__{exopacks on!}
<A>__{passengers don their exo pack breathing gear with practiced moves. everybody except jake, who's turning his this way and that trying to figure out the straps.}
<C>__{crew chief}
<D>__{remember people, you lose your mask you're unconscious in 20 seconds and you're dead in four minutes. let's nobody be dead today, it looks bad on my report.}
<A>__{the crew chief stops by jake long enough to bark }
<C>__{crew chief}
<D>__{exopack on, let's go!}
<A>__{beneath the shuttle air blasts outward for a hundred meter radius as it settles onto its landing gear. inside everybody is queued up in the aisles, with duffles ready. rows of tense, expectant faces in breathing masks and we dip down to find jake, wheelchair putting him at the level of everyone else's waists. the cargo ramp opens with a hydraulic whine.}
<C>__{crew chief}
<D>__{go directly into the base! do not stop! go straight inside!}
<A>__{hand held, running with the arriving colonists who double time down the ramp. they jog across the exposed apron toward a walkway covered in chainlink which leads to the complex. inside the chain link tunnel are a couple of sec ops troopers, corporal lyle wainfleet and private fike. sec ops is the colony's private security force. these guys are laid back, hardened, and haggard.}
<C>__{wainfleet}
<D>__{look at all that new meat.}
<A>__{their pov jake rolls down the ramp.}
<C>__{fike}
<D>__{check it out, man. meals on wheels.}
<C>__{wainfleet}
<D>__{that is just wrong.}
<A>__{jake, pumping his chair, looks around as a huge tractor, taller than a house, roars past on muddy wheels. he notices something sticking in the tires arrows. the neolithic weapons are jarring amid all the advanced technology. beyond the tractor, two vtol vehicles take off. armored and heavily armed, they are at 99 "scorpion" gunships. mitsubishi mk 6 ampsuits human operated walking machines 4 meters tall patrol the perimeter. they are heavily armored, and armed with a huge rotary cannon called a gau 90. beyond the outer fence stands a black wall of forest hundreds of feet high. a sentry gun opens fire from a tower. tracers light up the twilight. a shadowy shape shrieks and drops off the fence. it is an armed camp in a state of siege. wainfleet and fike give jake and his chair the hairy eyeball as he approaches.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what're you two limpdicks starin' at?}
<A>__{as jake rolls past, something swoops down behind him and k krash! smashes against the chain link right next to his head. a vicious aerial predator a meter across gnashes glass fangs against the steel. it stabs at him through the chain link with a tail ending in a glistening stiletto. a stingbat. wainfleet casually blasts it with his pistol. it drops off the fence, tail still lashing.}
<C>__{wainfleet}
<D>__{seen a lotta guys leave this place in a wheelchair. never seen anybody show up in one.}
<A>__{jake stares at the gnashing fangs of the dying alien. on a walkway of the ops center, seen from above, a uniformed figure grips the railing, watching jake pump his chair through the tunnel below. the hair is clipped short. the scalp is etched by long parallel scars where some pandoran denizen's claws raked across it. the bare arms, below tightly rolled sleeves, seem hewn out of some hard tropical wood. criss crossed by scars. the man raises his masked face to look at the sky. he eyes are an icy steel gray. his pov the mighty polyphemus seems to fill the sky, beyond the clouds.}
