<L>__{exterior andy's house garage night}
<A>__{(helen screaming over:) the hooded man has joan up against the garage wall. one of his hands is on her throat and the other is held over her mouth. in the struggle, she manages to sink her teeth into his hand. he pulls it free and hits her across the face. she reaches to a flower pot on a potting shelf and pole axes him on the top of the head. it staggers him briefly and enables her to move out of his grasp. she immediately grabs an iron rake from the garden rack and turns fiercely toward him. now standing, vanquished, breathing hard, and apparently having had enough, he begins to back away from her. when he reaches a safe distance, he turns and moves quickly off, disappearing into the dark.}
