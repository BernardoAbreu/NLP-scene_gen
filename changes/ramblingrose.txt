This character likes girls; his aloofness is modified, his face changes when he talks to them. The airline girl smiles back, she finds him attractive. We don't hear what they are saying, no dialogue on track -- it is obvious he is flirting with the girl in a mild way, but now a frown comes on his face and he turns his head as if slightly annoyed by something.}

He is DAVE WILKIE, erstwhile husband of the heroine of this story. Age has not been at all kind to Dave; his face is lined with bitterness, he is a sour, angry, lonely man and now he is making a very unpleasant scene with a ticket girl and an airline representative, waving his ticket and gesticulating angrily. He wears an expensive, ill-fitting suit and a Texas-type hat. We don't hear his angry complaints, no dialogue is on the track.}

The airline ticket girl speaks to him and he turns back to her, his face softening as he answers her, obviously saying he'll carry his bag. He nods goodbye to the girl, turns and the CAMERA follows him as he walks some distance away and stops, looks back with another pensive frown at the tall, gaunt man at the next counter.}

The CAMERA holds on him as he stares at the gaunt angry Dave, racking his brain. He shakes his head, he cannot place the man and yet he knows him. The CAMERA moves in closer on Willcox Hillyer's face as he stares in pensive puzzlement at this ghost from the past and now we hear, as if from a distance, FAINT MUSIC on the track -- it is "Dixie," played with beautiful lazy mocking love by the great Louis Armstrong in his prime. At first we can barely hear it, then the MUSIC becomes LOUDER as Hillyer's frown deepens and he seems almost to know the man. MAIN TITLE (SUPERIMPOSED): "RAMBLING ROSE" The MUSIC remains a bit in the distance, but it can be heard. OTHER TITLES (SUPERIMPOSED): over the following action. VARIOUS SHOTS, on Willcox Hillyer. He gives up his effort to recognize the strangely familiar Dave with a little shrug, turns and walks away with his travel bag.}

He is not a crass or lewd flirt, but life comes into his face when he sees a pretty girl -- he seems to have a real affection for girls: toward men he is polite but rather dry and ironic, almost aloof, but girls he likes. We see him sit in a seat, open his travel bag and take out long galley sheets. He stares for a moment rather wearily at the galleys, then sighs, puts on reading glasses and begins to make corrections as boarding passengers walk by in the aisle. Something or someone disturbs him, he looks up with a slight frown and CUT TO : a POV shot of Dave Wilkie, all wonder and enthusiasm. This OVER the TITLES and we do not hear the dialogue they speak, what we heard is LOUIS ARMSTRONG, but I will put the dialogue in here so the actors can act it. We do not want to hear it, the sense of what they are saying will be obvious from the acting.}

He looks around cautiously, then picks up the mattress of his bed. He pushes it far back and we see springs. He takes out a small "book" or pamphlet and stares gravely at it. CLOSE-UP: The front cover of the pamphlet. We see the overall title: LITTLE DIRTY COMIC BOOKS. And beneath it: BLONDIE AND DAGWOOD. And beneath that, in smaller letters: "Mr. Dithers Comes to Dinner -- and How!" We see Buddy's hands in the shot, and he opens the pamphlet and we catch enough of a glimpse of the thing to know it is pretty awful -- a drawing maybe of "Blondie" stark naked with a finger in her mouth going, "Tee-Hee!" ON Buddy, as he stares down with grave intentness at the Little Dirty Comic Book. Slyly now, he retraces his steps to the bureau and takes out a flashlight. He goes back to the bed, switches off the lamp, gets in the bed and turns on the flashlight and pulls the covers over his head. We hear a faint SOUND on the track and Buddy suddenly yanks back the covers, puts the flashlight on the table by the bed and throws the Little Dirty Comic Book under the bed. He lies on pillow and pretends he's asleep, and we hear the door of his room OPEN and a CREAKING on the floor. ANOTHER ANGLE, on a weepy Rose in a very thin nightgown.
