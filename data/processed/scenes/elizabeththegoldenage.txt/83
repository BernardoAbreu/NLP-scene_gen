<L>__{interior prison day}
<A>__{walsingham has a lamp in his hand. he moves slowly along a passage, bowed down by a sense of failure. he directs the light of his lamp through cell bars onto a face. the jesuit. reston looks back, unafraid.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{ready to die, i see, jesuit.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{i have done what i was sent to do.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{why was the gun not loaded?}
<A>__{reston doesn't answer. walsingham gazes at him a moment longer. then he moves the lamp along. there, shackled and white faced, sit babington and ramsay. walsingham studies their faces. walsingham carries his lamp down the passage and shines it into the next cell. here lies a man in chains, huddled on the floor. he looks up as the light falls on him. william. walsingham looks down on the pitiful sight.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{what was the jesuit sent to do?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{to kill the queen. you know it. you know everything.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{not quite everything.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i've told you all i know. go ahead and kill me. take what's left of me. i don't care any more. all my life you've had everything and i've had nothing. so finish it. there's a better world waiting for me. we'll all be judged in the end, brother. even you.}
<A>__{walsingham gazes down on this pitiful show of pride.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{you're no martyr. you weren't even much of a murderer. go back to france. back to your dreams. never let me hear of you again.}
<A>__{walsingham turns away. as he goes we see what he won't show william: that the hurt of the betrayal is almost more than he can bear. he goes back up the passage. as he passes reston, the jesuit calls out softly.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{send me home.}
