<A>__{allison and, alvy are on the bed, kissing. there are books all over the room; a fireplace, unlit, along one of the walls. alvy suddenly breaks away and sits on the edge of the bed. allison looks at him.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{h'm, i'm sorry, i can't go through with this, because it i can't get it off my mind, allison ... it's obsessing me!}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{well, i'm getting tired of it. i need your attention.}
<A>__{alvy gets up from the bed and starts walking restlessly around the room, gesturing with his hands.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{it but it it ... doesn't make any sense. he drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. so how is it possible for oswald to have fired from two angles at once? it doesn't make sense.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{alvy.}
<A>__{alvy, stopping for a moment at the fireplace mantel, sighs. he then snaps his fingers and starts walking again.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{i will tell you this! he was not marksman enough to hit a moving target at that range. but ...}
<P>__{(clears his throat)}
<D>__{if there was a second assassin ... it that's it!}
<A>__{alvy stops at the music stand with open sheet music on it as allison gets up from the bed and retrieves a pack of cigarettes from a bookshelf.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{we've been through this.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{if they they recovered the shells from that rifle.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(moving back to the bed and lighting a cigarette)}
<D>__{okay. all right, so whatta yuh saying, now? that e e everybody o o on the warren commission is in on this conspiracy, right?}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{well, why not?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{yeah, earl warren?}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(moving toward the bed)}
<D>__{hey ... honey, i don't know earl warren.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{lyndon johnson?}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(propping one knee on the bed and gesturing)}
<D>__{l l lyndon johns lyndon johnson is a politician. you know the ethics those guys have? it's like uh, a notch underneath child molester.}
<C>__{allison}

<C>__{allison}

<A>__{alvy touches allison's shoulder, then gets up from the bed and starts walking again.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{i i i i would leave out the men's room attendant.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{you're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{oh, my god!}
<P>__{(then, to the camera)}
<D>__{she's right! why did i turn off allison portchnik? she was she was beautiful. she was willing. she was real ... intelligent.}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{is it the old groucho marx joke? that that i i just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?}
