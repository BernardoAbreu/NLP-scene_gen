<L>__{interior exterior valentine's house. dusk.}
<A>__{a series of images that prove valentine (whoever he is) has taste, wealth, and influence, stretching back a good three decades at least. walking through some of these shots is a young beauty in a bathing suit named adhara. she advances slowly, not entirely sure of herself, and stops to look at things just like we do. at one point she looks to see a beefy guy (gordon) sitting at the kitchen counter, flipping through a magazine. he looks her up and down, more from reflex than anything. she continues on. eventually she emerges through sliding glass doors and on to a patio.}
<B>__{her pov}
<A>__{a figure by the pool, talking on the phone. his back to us. the pool is spectacular, mosaic tile bottomed.}
<B>__{adhara}
<A>__{approaches, then sits beside him. his voice is soothing, but with the tiniest hint of exasperation that comes with being slightly ahead of everyone.}
