<D>__{it's the night of the youth orchestra concert. jenny, her mother and father are on their way out of the door. jack is carrying the cello. jenny is in her school uniform, with her hair scrubbed back in a severe ponytail. the three of them are flustered. jenny opens the front door for her father and he stumbles outside.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oh!}
<L>__{12a int exterior jenny's house. evening}
<D>__{she has seen something on the doorstep, and she stoops to pick it up a large bunch of flowers.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{they're for me!}
<C>__{marjorie}
<P>__{(curious)}
<D>__{who are they from? jenny opens the card that's attached to them.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{gosh. him.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{who's `him'?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{just...a chap i met.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{a chap who sends flowers? so he's a man chap?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yes, he is, really.}
<A>__{jack stares at the flowers in disbelief. the bunch of flowers has created in jack the kind of panic and fear more typically associated with a biochemical attack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's going on here?}
<C>__{marjorie}
<P>__{(drily, knowing the}
<D>__{trouble this will}
<P>__{cause)}
<D>__{jack,i'm afraid jenny has been sent some flowers by a chap.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{a chap? what kind of chap? who? why?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(patiently)}
<D>__{he's wishing me luck for tonight.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{are you sure that's all he's wishing? and where does he get the money from?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{he earns it, i expect.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what do you mean, he earns it? why isn't he at school? what does he do?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{can we just go? otherwise the bunch of good luck flowers will actually be responsible for me actually missing the concert. which would be ironic, n'est ce pas?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well i don't like it.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{objection noted. jenny?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{noted.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ten bob's worth of luck, i reckon. that's a lot for a schoolgirl. you can't leave them out here, anyway. i'd burgle a house that had flowers outside. they'll think we're made of money.}
