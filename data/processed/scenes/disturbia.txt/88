<A>__{kale falls back in the leather chair, fighting his emotions, trying to keep them in check. he glances out to ashley's. dark. he peers around the office the articles, the books, his dad's photos... the family portrait of dad, mom, and kale, smiling wide... their lives ahead of them...}
<L>__{interior kale's bedroom night}
<A>__{in the darkness, find kale sitting in his video game chair staring out at giles' house. his pov giles' garage door is open. giles' silver toyota is parked inside next to the mustang. there's a light or two on inside giles' house but no signs of movement. kale throws intermittent glances out the window as he starts to unscrew the back of the dv cam. he lifts the back off, then reaches in a nearby box and pulls out a blue tooth wireless circuit board. he starts connecting it inside the camera... jump cut: kale screws the back of the camera on, takes a swig of a soda. there's suddenly fierce knocking at kale's front door. kale just sits there. staring ahead. more knocking and doorbell ringing. kale jumps from his chair, grabs the bat.}
