<L>__{interior cellar night}
<A>__{eric, zed, francois, ricardo, jean, claude, and oliver are all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar. somewhere crazy raymond scott toy jazz music is playing. an old wine cellar has been converted into a toy jazz club. nothing fancy...dirt floors, chairs and small tables scattered about...but the arched brick ceilings make for great acoustics.}
<B>__{on stage}
<A>__{a band is playing away. in the audience sit about twelve french people, all enjoying the music.}
<B>__{at the buffet}
<A>__{in the back of the club near the doors some tables have been set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it. behind the tables are two rotund but happy french women mirelle and}
<B>__{josephine.}
<A>__{eric, zed, francois, ricardo, jean, claude, and oliver walk in and immediately start blabbing away in french to mirelle and josephine. eric hands them some money. zed's table everyone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club. oliver sits next to zed.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{so, how long have you known eric?}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{well, eric's mother is american.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{yeah, and his dad's french.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{they're divorced. and she and his father had some kind of six month split plan set up. so every six months he would come back to the states. we were best friends. eventually he and his mother had a falling out and he stayed here. it's been...years.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{well, it's good to have you here. eric speaks fairly highly of you. say, he says you're a big fan of viking films.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{well...i suppose. i used to be, when i was young.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{oh they're the best. helmets with horns on them. shit. that's fucking genius.}
<A>__{he starts laughing.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{how 'bout toy jazz? you like it?}
<A>__{zed watches the players on stage and then nods.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{yeah...i guess.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{i love it. it's really good, you know? like real music. it has a heart and culture all it's own. it's, like, jazz for dwarves...or guys in leiderhosen. total purity of essence.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{hungry cannibals'd like it.}
<A>__{then claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle of red wine.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{here, you must drink some of this wine, it's good.}
<A>__{he pours zed a glass. oliver passes on the wine.}
<C>__{oliver}
<P>__{(to claude)}
<D>__{non merci, c'est de la merde.}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(to oliver)}
<D>__{la ferme. c'est du bon vin.}
<P>__{(to zed)}
<D>__{the fucking english.}
<A>__{zed sips some. he's in no real shape to tell if the wine's good or not.}
<B>__{on stage}
<A>__{suddenly, it seems as though the bands music gets louder. the horns really start to scream and the room becomes a delirium of music. the band stands up.}
<B>__{in the audience}
<A>__{the people watching start to dance, if not in their seats then right in front of everything. zed's table suddenly, zed notices something...}
<B>__{on stage}
<A>__{eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the band. zed's table zed blinks but it's true. oliver and claude start laughing.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{look at him. he's crazy.}
<B>__{on stage}
<A>__{and surely he must be, yet, in a strange way, he's keeping up with the other musicians and sounding pretty good. eric is all smile as he plays with them. sweat is running down his face but he's caught up in the moment. elise, a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the stage, caught up in eric's frenzy, and is dancing about like james brown. then, the music crescendos and eric hands the trombone back to a musician. the set is over. eric skips off the stage and walks over to where oliver, claude, and zed are sitting.}
