<L>__{interior springwood tavern}
<A>__{dump is too clean a word, dive is too nice, abomination is more like it. a greenish haze covers everything. instead of sawdust on the floor there is a collection of debris that looks like a compilation of human teeth, crushed bugs, and pools of unmentionable goo. then there's the people. imagine any profanity, any obscenity,any blasphemy, add them all up then double them. it wouldn't even come close to the patrons of this jointerior they dance, they yell, they drink bloody bubbling mixtures. there's a guy to the right that doesn't seem to mind that half his brain is showing. that girl over there has no jaw. in a booth is a couple that are connected at the lips. a ventriloquist on stage is entertaining the troops with his hand up the back of a real body. scott steps through the door and blinks about a dozen times. then he decides that the smart course of action is to turn around and go right back out. a mutant bouncer, half his face a skull, blocks scott's way.}
<C>__{mutant bouncer}
<D>__{two drink minimum.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{ah, that's okay. i think i'm underage, anyway.}
<C>__{mutant bouncer}
<D>__{two drink minimum.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{no, really. i'm driving.}
<C>__{mutant bouncer}
<D>__{two drink minimum.}
<A>__{the bouncer with the limited vocabulary seems adamant. scott backs off and turns around. he carefully moves forward. a mutant waitress with three breasts slips next to him.}
<C>__{mutant waitress}
<D>__{can i get you anything?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{that's okay. i will just sit at the bar.}
<C>__{mutant waitress}
<D>__{alright, honey. you call if you need anything.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{you bet. you'll be the first to know.}
<A>__{scott turns away, trying to keep his eyes in their sockets. he slides up to the bar next to a mutant businessman. the man's head is on backwards, his arms lean on the bar while his face looks out into the crowd. he has to twist his neck to sip his vile drink. a bartender, surprisingly normal looking, steps up to scott.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{what'll it be?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{um, a beer, i guess.}
<A>__{the bartender fills a twisted glass with a sickly brown liquid. chunks of matter float amongst the foam. scott takes the drink warily and looks up at the businessman next to him. the mutant smiles at him.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{go on. puts hair on your back.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{and that's all?}
<A>__{the bartender returns. holds one of those half pineapple type drinks in his hand, except this one has the back end of a wriggling lizard sticking out of mucousy fluid under a tiny umbrella. he gives it to scott.}
<C>__{scott }
<D>__{that's okay, this'll be plenty.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{no charge. compliments of the man at the end of the bar.}
<A>__{the bartender walks away and scott cranes his head to look down the bar. scott's pov the crowd blocks his view, but we can see a gloved hand with four blades strapped to it tapping nonchalantly on the surface of the wood.}
<B>__{back to scott}
<A>__{he picks up his drinks, holding the moving one at arm's length, and heads down the bar.}
<B>__{at the end of the bar}
<A>__{sits freddy krueger. he sips coolly on some hideous concoction as scott sits down in the chair next to him and lights a cigarette, trying to look equally cool.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{welcome to my favorite haunt.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{so you're the man.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{at your service.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{what's on your mind?}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{a deal.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{a deal's what got me into this.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{bring jacob to me.}
<A>__{scott, valiantly holding on to his nerve, raises an eyebrow.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{what's in it for me?}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{power. you don't need to hang out with those losers. you're a take charge kind of guy, scott. like when you took charge of your father.}
<A>__{suddenly freddy is spinning a gun on the bar with his free hand. scott grimaces.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{leave my father out of this.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{i will make you mayor of rosedale.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{after you make it look like this?}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{you can have karen.}
<A>__{that was freddy's trump card. it really hits a nerve in scott. karen's everything he's ever wanted.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{alive?}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{any way you want her.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{shake?}
<A>__{krueger holds out his knives. scott shakes his head.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{no thanks. i trust you.}
<A>__{freddy laughs.}
