<D>__{look at you, cutey! what are we doing?}
<C>__{joel}

<C>__{joe early}
<D>__{c'mon, jill. get up, faggot. c'mon.}
<A>__{joel doesn't say anything. he peeks humiliated at clementine. she's watching him. she's got a tear in her eye. she kneels down beside him, puts her arm around him.}

<D>__{i'm too scared to even throw a punch. when i tell people this story i leave that part out.}
