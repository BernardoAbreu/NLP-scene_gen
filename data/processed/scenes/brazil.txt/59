<T>__{cut :}
<A>__{to sam entering extremely tacky sitting room shrouded in half darkness. this is the same flat from which the father was taken at the beginning of the film: the hole is still in the ceiling. sam becomes aware of a woman sitting absolutely still at a small table by the only (still broken) window in the room.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{are you mrs buttle?}
<A>__{the woman nods very slightly without looking at him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{my name is lowry sam lowry. i'm from the ministry of information.}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{i've come to give you a cheque.}
<A>__{sam takes the cheque out of his pocket and puts it on the table to tempt mrs buttle into a flicker of interest but she fails to notice it or him for that matter. sam pushes the cheque a little way towards mrs buttle but she does not respond.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(indicting cheque)}
<D>__{it's a refund ... i'm afraid there was a mistake.}
<C>__{mrs buttle}
<D>__{mistake?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(encouraged)}
<D>__{yes. not my department ... i'm only records. it seems that mr buttle was overcharged by information retrieval. i don't think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... i suppose we're all human.}
<A>__{sam looks around and sees the hole in the ceiling.}
<D>__{oh ... what happened to the ...?}
<A>__{he gets nothing back.}
<D>__{actually, my bringing this here is rather unorthodox ... usually any payments are made through the central computer ... but, er ... there were certain difficulties, and rather than cause delay, we thought you might appreciate this now ... it being christmas.}
<C>__{mrs buttle}
<D>__{my husband's dead, isn't he?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{er ... i assure you mrs buttle, the ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. if you have any complaints which you'd like to make, i'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.}
<C>__{mrs buttle}
<D>__{what have you done with his body?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{um ...}
<A>__{mrs buttle starts to cry.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{look, i'm very sorry, but i'm afraid i don't know anything about it ... i'm really just delivering the cheque. er ... if you wouldn't mind signing these receipts}
<P>__{(producing blue and pink receipts)}
<D>__{i will go and leave you in peace.}
<A>__{sam picks up the cheque and gives it to mrs buttle together with the receipts. mrs buttle tears them up and throws them in his face.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{uh ...}
<C>__{mrs buttle}
<D>__{he hadn't done anything ... he was good ... what have you done with his body?}
<A>__{sam looks around for an escape and sees a young buttle standing in the doorway. the boy is looking at him with a blank tearful face. suddenly the boy launches himself at sam with terrible ferocity. sam is knocked against the wall. a mirror falls off the wall and smashes on the floor. the boy is all over sam kicking and pulling his hair. mrs buttle's reaction, however, is to try and pull the boy away from sam. by the time she succeeds, sam is on his hands and knees, in pain. the boy is crying and shouting, and mrs buttle is loudly trying to quieten the}
<B>__{boy.}
<A>__{from sam's pov, a piece of broken mirror lying on the floor reflects the hole in the ceiling ... with jill's head and shoulders framed in the hole. the moment is unreal for sam in his dazed condition. the vision seems unreal too. jill is staring at sam out of the piece of mirror and. she's very much the girl from his dream now.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(mumbles)}
<D>__{it's you ... it's you ...}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{mrs buttle, are you alright?}
<A>__{sam grabs at the image, i.e. at the mirror, shifting the angle so that the vision disappears. he looks for the vision on the floor but can't find it. then he begins to realise the reality of what he has seen. he stands up, dazed and battered. mrs buttle has been looking up at the ceiling. sam looks up at the ceiling but there is now only the empty space of the hole.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{wait! stop! come back!!}
<A>__{mrs buttle is shouting. sam rushes out of the flat.}
