<L>__{interior corridor day}
<A>__{the members of the choir are all gathered outside mother superior's office, leaning close to the door and listening to her harangue christy. they are surprised to find themselves joined suddenly by bishop o'hara, and part to let him through. he leans down to the keyhole and listens.}
<L>__{interior office}
<A>__{mother superior is livid.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{gospel. a jazz solo on the organ. what next? jesus goes to rio? good friday a go go? what were you thinking?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{i was thinking las vegas. get some butts in those seats.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{and what next? popcorn? curtain calls? this is not a theater. or a casino.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(sincerely)}
<D>__{exactly. people like going to theaters and casinos. but they think church is for grandma we could change that. pack the jointerior}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{through blasphemy? you have corrupted the entire choir!}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{hold on. that's not fair. i worked hard with them. they gave up their free time, and they loved it. those women are happy. and we can get even better. we can wake this place up.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{out of the question.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{please let me try. i'm begging you.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{and i am refusing. as of tomorrow, mary lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.}
<A>__{christy is crestfallen. there is a knock on the door, and o'hara enters. the other members of the choir are in behind him like sardines.}
<C>__{bishop o'hara}
<D>__{reverend mother, i just wanted to congratulate you.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{bishop o'hara}
<D>__{i haven't enjoyed mass this much in years. what a marvelous program. innovative. inspiring. you are to be commended.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{well... thank you.}
<C>__{bishop o'hara}
<D>__{i can't wait until next sunday, when the choir performs again. did you see the people walk right in from the street? that music, that heavenly music it called to them.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{perhaps.}
<C>__{bishop o'hara}
<D>__{i must tell the cardinal. i.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{christy has just been eating this up with a spoon.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{excuse me, bishop. reverend mother has some other ideas too. she's too modest to talk about it, but she thinks we should get out of the convent and into the neighborhood more.}
<P>__{(putting her hands on}
<D>__{mother superior's}
<P>__{shoulders)}
<D>__{this woman.}
<A>__{mary patrick jumps forward.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{bless her! there are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve. that's why many of us became nuns. it's marvelous, reverend mother.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<P>__{(confused by the turn things have taken)}
<D>__{really...}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(with regard to mother superior)}
<D>__{you know reverend mother. hides her light under a bushel. she has plans for us to move right onto the streets. get to know people. work with 'em.}
<C>__{bishop o'hara}
<P>__{(to mother superior)}
<D>__{you're a pioneer.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{but, bishop, surely you realize this is a most dangerous neighborhood.}
<C>__{o'hara}
<D>__{and you'll face that danger head on. as if i could stop you. and you have my complete support in this matter. anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(hugging mother superior from behind)}
<D>__{don't you love her?}
