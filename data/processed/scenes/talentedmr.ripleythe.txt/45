<A>__{ripley hikes up michelangelo's arcoeli steps. then he's looking down from the campodoglio at the forum below. then he's walking by the oversized fragments of the colossus. this is the real ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by antiquity. he's awed. he's cold. he so much wishes he weren't alone.}
