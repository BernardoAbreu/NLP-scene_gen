<A>__{ted sits opposite frank, the grocery store manager. we see his name and title on a desk nameplate. frank sits at the desk, staring at ted.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{so. you think you got what it takes?}
<C>__{ted}

<D>__{shit.}
<L>__{exterior boston common late afternoon}
<A>__{(over music:) john and ted walk across the common, passing various park goers. the occasional person notices and points with a "hey, isn't that..." sort of look. they passes three cute girls who flag ted down. two pose with him as the third takes their picture with her cellphone. ted poses for the photo with one hand on the girl's breast. she laughs hard. ted waves goodbye, and he and john make their way over to a park bench. they sit. john takes out the weed, looks around for a beat, then starts to discreetly roll a jointerior}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well, i'm a former celebrity with a minimum wage job. this must be what the cast of different strokes feels like.}
<C>__{o.s. voice}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{john and ted react, startled. john stuffs the weed in his pocket, accidentally dropping the buds in the rolling papers on the ground. angle on a creepy looking man glancing at them repeatedly. this is donny, the fat kid we saw in the prologue. he has grown up into a thinner but no less creepy man.}
<C>__{donny}
<D>__{i'm sorry to bother you, but my son and i couldn't help but admire your teddy bear.}
<A>__{adjust to reveal his son, who looks exactly like fat young donny from earlier.}

<C>__{donny}
<D>__{i'm donny. and this is my boy, robert. i have to tell you, i've been fascinated by your story ever since i was a boy. i remember seeing you on the carson show. you were just wonderful.}
<A>__{brief angle on the ground, where a pigeon is pecking at the dropped weed.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah, that was ah... that was a good time.}
<C>__{donny}
<P>__{(to john)}
<D>__{i wonder, is there any chance i could purchase the bear from you? for my son? john ted huh? excuse me?}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(calm)}
<D>__{i want it.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{hey, i'm not an "it", pal. i'm a "he."}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(leaning down to his level)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, little guy, but my bear isn't for sale. i've had him since i was about your age. he's very special to me.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{sit up straight when you talk to me.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(recoiling)}
<D>__{ew, why the fuck did he say that?}
<C>__{donny}
<D>__{don't swear in front of my child. now. we are very interested in the bear. if you'd like to work out some sort of arrangement, here's my address and phone number.}
<A>__{he writes on a slip of paper and hands it to john. john smiles awkwardly and puts it in his wallet.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{okay. will do. here it goes, in the really important pocket for really important stuff.}
<A>__{donny and robert walk off. donny turns and steals a glance back at ted as they move off.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{wow. can you imagine what that little shit would do to me?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh man, i can totally see him just taking you down to the basement and really slowly de limbing you while singing some creepy victorian nursery rhyme.}
<A>__{john tugs on one of ted's arms trying to creep him out. he then breaks into a creepy falsetto.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{oh, my little sixpence my pretty little sixpence i love my sixpence better than my life.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{fuck you. why do you have to take it so far? now it's real. fuck you again for that. c'mon, let's go find a better place to get stoned.}
<A>__{they exit. after a beat, the pigeon flies into frame, slamming right into a fucking tree.}
