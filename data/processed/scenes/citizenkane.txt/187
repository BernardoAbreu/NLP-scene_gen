<A>__{night susan, aged twenty, neatly but cheaply dressed in the style of the period, is leaving the drug store. it's about 8 o'clock at night. with a large, man sized handkerchief pressed to her cheek, she is in considerable pain. the street is wet after a recent rain. she walks a few steps towards the middle of the block, and can stand it no longer. she stops, opens a bottle of oil of cloves that she has in her hand, applies some to her finger, and rubs her gums. she walks on, the pain only a bit better. four or five houses farther along, she comes to what is clearly her own doorway a shabby, old four story apartment house. she turns toward the doorway, which is up a tiny stoop, about three steps. as she does so, kane, coming from the opposite direction, almost bumps into her and turns to his left to avoid her. his shoulder bumps hers and she turns. as she does so, kane, forced to change his course, steps on the loose end of a plank which covers a puddle in the bad sidewalk. the plank rises up and cracks him on the knee, also covering him with mud.}
