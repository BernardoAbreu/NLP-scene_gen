<A>__{clearing the kitchen counter, gittes sees ida sessions lying on her back on the floor, surrounded by the groceries from a broken bag. ice cream has melted around her. her eyes are open, a stream of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth. she's recognizable as the woman who posed as evelyn mulwray. gittes kneels over her. he gingerly opens her handbag, fishes for its contents, takes them and looks at them on the kitchen counter. wallet with a few bills in it, driver's license with her name. a screen actors guild card. gittes nods, turns, carefully replaces the items in the purse. he idly opens the broom closet, pantry, and even frigidaire, which is all but empty. then he steps over her body and moves across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar.}
