<D>__{now what you'll soon discover is the true miracle and gift of laughter.}
<C>__{laughter therapist }
<D>__{learning to laugh at ourselves and others through non judgemental means is far more effective than any prescription drug, or, rehabilitation center. you see, when we laugh, our bodies release endorphins that not only support the immune system, but also release deeply stored emotional pain, and give us a fresh new outlook on life.}
