<L>__{int: brotherhood building, cell anteroom continuing}
<A>__{a door slamming behind silus, he is in a strangely, eerily lit cubicle.}
<C>__{silus}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{the police officer. lilly. did he infect her with this?}
<C>__{professor liepsky}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{no. she was lucky. but it is in edgar's blood. it always will be.}
<A>__{...and another door in front of silus clicks, then slides open to reveal...}
<L>__{int: brotherhood building, cell continuing}
<A>__{edgar, sitting in the chair. he immediately turns to the door, his eyes burrowing straight into silus. silus moves forward. we track, silus' pov, toward edgar and the reality of his predicament is revealed. there are metal rods extending from the cage around him. two at the sides. two from the front. they strategically pointed at edgar's chest and sides. if he was to try to get up, they would pierce him.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{hello my brother.}
<A>__{we can now see edgar for the first time in something approaching a normal state. he looks similar to silus, perhaps not quite so perfect. he radiates confident primeval power; less a man captured than an animal waiting. edgar is smiles. he shifts a little, we see the rods piercing his flesh.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{do you like what they've done for me silus?}
<A>__{he moves again, as if enjoying it.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{you are sick. we will help you if we can.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{help me? i am being what i was meant to be. how can you help me from that? or do you want to tame me? brainwash me? animal or vegetable, are those the two choices, silus?}
<A>__{edgar leans closer to silus.}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i want to share the feeling with you. to feel their blood flow until every last drop is yours, until that weak, pointless little pump finally stops.}
<A>__{they are staring at each other very intently now. edgar smiles gently.}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the one i had, the police woman. she was so strong. i found it hard to leave her.}
<A>__{edgar moves.}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{is she dead?}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{she survived.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{good. i will have her again.}
<A>__{for perhaps the first time, we see a real hint of anger on silus' face.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{you won't touch her.}
<A>__{edgar looks at his brother for a moment. edgar's features are a paradox; almost sympathy for silus followed by understanding. then he smiles.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{you've chosen to watch over her. you want her don't you? i can see it in your eyes. you are like me.}
<A>__{silus' control has returned now.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{i will pray for your cure, brother.}
<A>__{silus then turns and leaves.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{i wont be able to forgive you for this you know? not ever. in fact, when i get out of here...}
<A>__{he moves violently, blood seeping from his wounds now.}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i will make you see. i will show you the way. i will see you drink your little police woman right through.}
<A>__{by now frightening music has hummed into existence. silus has paused at the door to the cell. without looking back he passes through the door, leaving edgar to his prison. edgar, slowly turns back to the window in front of him. he sees himself reflected in it. the camera moves into edgar's eyes. the lights go out. all we are left with are his strange reflective eyes. waiting. waiting.}
