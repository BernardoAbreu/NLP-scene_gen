<L>__{interior archer's cell day}
<A>__{archer paces impatiently... as the door rolls open. walton is looking at him with cool respect.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{you have a visitor.}
<A>__{archer smiles to himself pleased at brodie's timeliness.}
<L>__{interior interrogation room day}
<A>__{archer's boots lock down as the guillotine door rises. but his confidence evaporates into unspeakable horror. because he finds himself staring into the blue eyes of jon archer. this man has archer's face his real face.}
<C>__{impostor}
<D>__{what's the matter? don't you like the new me?}
<A>__{archer studies the image of his former self trying to understand. then he recognizes the smirk on the face, the mocking twinkle in the eyes and he says what he cannot say...}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{ castor...?}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{not anymore.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{it can't be. it's impossible.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{i believe the phrase dr. hoag used was 'titanically remote'. who knows? maybe the trauma of having my face cut off pulled me out. or maybe god really is on my side after all.}
<P>__{(starts pacing)}
<D>__{by the way, i know you don't get the papers in here.}
<A>__{continuing to circle, he displays the current la times:}
<D>__{"inferno at hoag institute malcolm hoag dead"}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{terrible tragedy. hoag was such a genius but selfish with his artistry. i actually had to torture his assistants to convince him to perform the same surgery on me.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{you killed them?}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{of course i killed them, you dumb fuck. hoag, his staff...}
<A>__{flash on hoag's body on the floor of the burning lab. two more burned bodies adjoin hoag's.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{miller and brodie }
<A>__{flash on brodie and miller dead in a mangled car wreck.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{i even paid a visit to your buddy tito.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{he doesn't know anything about this!}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{come on, jon. i think i know you better than that. i only wish you could have been there to see the look on his face }
<A>__{flash on tito... he smiles, then recoils in shock as castor lifts a pistol and shoots him... then he picks up archer's wedding band off the counter...}
