<L>__{interior living room night}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{mary comes in and picks up the phone.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i will get it.}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{hello. yes, this is mrs. bailey.}
<A>__{george enters shot, and stands listening to her.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{oh, thank you, mrs. welch. i'm sure she'll be all right. the doctor says that she ought to be out of bed in time to have her christmas dinner.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{is that zuzu's teacher?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(hand over receiver)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{let me speak to her.}
<A>__{he snatches the phone from mary.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{hello. hello, mrs. welch? this is george bailey. i'm zuzu's father. say, what kind of a teacher are you anyway? what do you mean sending her home like that, halfnaked? do you realize she'll probably end up with pneumonia on account of you?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{george!}
<A>__{she puts a restraining hand on his arm. he shakes it off. she cannot know that george's tirade against mrs. welch is really a tirade against the world, against life itself, against god. over the phone we hear mrs. welch's voice sputtering with protest.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for to have teachers like you? silly, stupid, careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on? you know, maybe my kids aren't the best dressed kids; maybe they don't have any decent clothes...}
<A>__{mary succeeds in wresting the phone from george's hand.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{aw, that stupid...}
<A>__{mary speaks quickly in to the phone.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{hello, mrs. welch. i want to apologize... hello... hello...}
<P>__{(to george)}
<D>__{she's hung up.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(savagely)}
<D>__{i will hang her up!}
<A>__{but the telephone is suddenly alive with a powerful male voice calling:}
<C>__{mr. welch's voice}
<D>__{now, who do you think you are?}
<A>__{george hears this and grabs the receiver from mary.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(to mary)}
<D>__{wait a minute.}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{hello? who is this? oh, mr. welch? okay, that's fine, mr. welch. gives me a chance to tell you what i really think of your wife.}
<A>__{mary once more tries to take the phone from him.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{george...}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(raving at her)}
<D>__{will you get out and let me handle this?}
<P>__{(into phone shouting)}
<D>__{hello? hello? what? oh, you will, huh? okay, mr. welch, any time you think you're man enough... hello? any...}
<A>__{but before he can think of an insult to top welch's, we hear a click on the phone.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh...}
<A>__{he hangs up the receiver, and turns toward the living room. his face is flushed and wet.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{daddy, how do you spell "hallelujah"?}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{how should i know? what do you think i am, a dictionary?}
<A>__{he yells at tommy, noisily playing with his vacuum cleaner.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{tommy, stop that! stop it!}
<A>__{janie is still practicing at the piano, monotonously.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(savagely)}
<D>__{janie, haven't you learned that silly tune yet? you've played it over and over again. now stop it! stop it!}
