<L>__{interior a lounge, private aviation terminal day}
<A>__{through the window, we see scruggs' plane being refueled while scruggs and motley in a run down lounge are talking on a speaker phone with lowell. they've taken over the secretary's office for privacy.}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(re: footage)}
<D>__{what do we do with that?}
<A>__{the phone rings.}
<C>__{debbie deluca}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{richard scruggs' voice }
<D>__{richard scruggs...}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the state of mississippi, did you not?}
<C>__{richard scruggs}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{that's right...}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{well, i'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at brown & williamson, a former corporate officer there.}
<C>__{richard scruggs}
<D>__{what's your interest in this, mr. bergman?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{well, he may tape an interview with us. and, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.}
<C>__{motley}
<D>__{it could work. if it's public record, it's public record.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{yeah, and he's going to need legal representation.}
<C>__{motley}
<D>__{he sure as hell will.}
<C>__{richard scruggs}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{has he decided to go public? because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle blowers, so we know... big tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. so, is your man truly committed?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{well, actually, no. well, he's on the fence. that's the pointerior}
<A>__{scruggs and motley exchange a look... motley shrugs...}
<C>__{richard scruggs}
<D>__{well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{well, would you want him to call you? or, you want to call him? how do you want to do it?}
<C>__{richard scruggs}
<P>__{(no nonsense)}
<D>__{it would be better if he called us.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{richard scruggs}
<D>__{alright?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{okay. thank you.}
<A>__{at this moment, these two attorneys are unsold on the prospect of jeffrey wigand. scruggs disconnects.}
<C>__{lowell }
<D>__{shit...}
