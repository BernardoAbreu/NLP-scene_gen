<L>__{interior bar room night}
<A>__{jacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at bay. but, as seth predicted, it is the shining power of his restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. jacob is making his way through the vampires, toward the back door. a lot of the bats have transformed into bat devil human creatures. the creatures stand at the edge of jacob's force field of holiness. many bat things fly around the bar like mad, whirling dervishes. a cluster of bat things over above and in front of jacob. they all growl and hiss at the man of god. for every one step forward jacob takes, the vampire stake one step back. jacob recites the verse from the bible in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone. as he speaks with authority and strength, he sees frost lying on the ground, bat things on him like ants on a candy bar. but jacob is too much in control to let even this repugnant sight trip him up. jacob has backed himself up by the door.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{open the door.}
<A>__{the door flies open. jacob jumps inside. the door slams shut. jacob hugs daughter and son. as he hugs them, we see his bloody arm. when he releases them, they can't help but notice.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{did he...?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yep.}
<A>__{seth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping over tables and cussing a blue streak.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{fuck, piss, shit! mother fuckin' vampires! mother fuckin' vampires! goddamn mother fuckin' vampires!}
<A>__{seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the creatures on the other side.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you all are gonna fuckin' die! i'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(to seth)}
<D>__{you bet your sweet ass you are, and i'm gonna help you do it. but we ain't got much time.}
<A>__{kate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no, i'm not. i've been bit. in effect, i'm already dead.}
<A>__{scott and kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for dear life. jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the kids will never have the courage for what they must do.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(to his children)}
<D>__{children, listen to me. i love you two more than anybody. and i just want you to know you've made me proud all your lives. but never more so than tonight. and i wish we could sit here and cry till i pass on, but we can't. because i'm not going to pass on. i'm going to turn into a monster. and when i do, i'm going to be dangerous. but before that happens, just know i love you.}
<P>__{(to seth and the kids)}
<D>__{now, i'd say in the next twenty or thirty minutes our friends outside will bust in this door. and i will probably turn into a vampire within the hour. now, you have two choices. you can wait for me to turn, then deal with me, then wait for them to burst inside here and the three of you will deal with them. or, we can kick open that door and the four of us can hit 'em with everything we have, and carve a path right through 'em to front entrance. but if we're gonna go at 'em, we gotta go at 'em now. i confused them, i scared them, i took them off guard. but they're going to get unconfused, they're going to get unscared, they're going to get together and they're going to hit that door like a ton of bricks. and when that moment arrives, we gotta be ready.}
<A>__{jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled with boxes and crates.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what's this stuff?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{my guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. this is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{well, i say lets tear this place apart for weapons. so when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. i just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as i can.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{amen.}
<B>__{montage}
<A>__{the survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. a lot of what they find is bullshit. pantyhose, coffee, teddy bears, etc. but a few of the boxes are just what the doctor ordered. cases from a sporting good supplier yield a shipment of baseball bats. meant to arrive at toy stores are a shipment of uzi replica squirt guns and a box of balloons. and captured en route to a hardware store are shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers. seth and scott saw the bats into wooden stakes. kate fills the uzi squirt guns with tap water from the backroom sink. jacob, with seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo. vampires all start converging on the back room door, getting their courage back. kate makes water balloons. scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. seth attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer. jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons, turning it into holy water. our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come. the back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes, begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side. the room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching, pounding, squeaking and screaming. finally they're ready. jacob turns to his kids.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{before we go any further, i need you three to promise me something. i will fight with you to the bitter end, but when i turn into one of them, i won't be jacob anymore. i will be a lap dog of satan. i want you three to promise you'll take me down, no different from the rest.}
<A>__{the kids can't say the words.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i promise.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{kate, scott?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i promise.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{scott?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{yeah, i promise.}
<A>__{jacob doesn't believe them.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{why don't i believe you?}
<P>__{(he picks up the .45)}
<D>__{i'm gonna ask you two again, then i want you to swear to god that you'll kill me. if you don't, i'm gonna just kill myself right now. now, since you need me i think you better swear. kate, do you swear to god that when i turn into one of the undead, you'll kill me?}
<A>__{kate doesn't answer. jacob places the .45 barrel against his temple.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{kate, we don't have all day, so i'm only gonna count to five. one...two... three... four...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{okay, okay, i promise i will do it!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{not good enough, swear to god.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i swear to god, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, i will kill you.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{good girl. now, scott, we have even less time, so i'm only giving you the count of three. one...}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{you don't believe in suicide.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it's not suicide if you're already dead. two...}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{okay, i will kill you when you change, i swear to god in jesus christ's name.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{thank you, son.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{okay, vampire killers, let's kill some fuckin' vampires.}
