<A>__{george runs up the path to the front door of the house and raps on the door. he rings the bell and taps on the glass, when his attention is caught by a sign on the wall reading: "ma bailey's boarding house."}
<B>__{medium closeup george at the door}
<A>__{the door opens and a woman appears. it is mrs. bailey, but she has changed amazingly. her face is harsh and tired. in her eyes, once kindly and understanding, there is now cold suspicion. she gives no sign that she knows him.}
<C>__{ma bailey}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{mother...}
