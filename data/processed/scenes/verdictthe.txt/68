<D>__{i'm an attorney on trial before the bar. representing my client. my client, do you understand? you open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{listen to me, fella...}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{no, no, you listen to me. all i wanted in this case is an even shake. you rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, i can't get a continuance, and i don't give a damn. i'm going up there and i'm going to try it. let the jury decide. they told me sweeney he's a hard ass, he's a defendant's judge. i don't care. i said, the hell with it. the hell with it. i will take my chances he'll be fair.}
