<L>__{int residence plaza the elevator}
<A>__{from a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a great height. as it reaches the courtyard the runner darts out, pushes into the crowd.}
<B>__{out with the runner}
<A>__{as he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes for a kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the courtyard. he is moving even faster now, glancing back as if he fears pursuit. another angle corridor above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and silver, a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand and watching. it is francis.}
<B>__{with the runner}
<A>__{moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling the presence above. he looks up, sees the sandman and his face breaks in terror. he wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the hall. the sandman (francis) vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.}
<B>__{p.o.v.}
<A>__{the crowd melting, parting to reveal the runner backed against the pool. people are yelling, shaking their fists, terribly excited and fearful.}
<B>__{the sandman}
<A>__{emotionless. aims. fires. the runner close seeming to burst aflame in the lens, then slipping below frame to reveal francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. the crowd closing in behind him, applauding, congratulating him.}
<B>__{the sandman}
<A>__{arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. he leans over, lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a black flowercrystal shape in it. he lets the hand fall back now as the crowd cheers and applauds him.}
