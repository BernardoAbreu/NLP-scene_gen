<L>__{interior tex's room night}
<A>__{close shot jean louis. he looks around, uncertainly, first one way, then the other. camera pulls back to show him sitting on scobie's knee, the large man holding him with his good hand, the metal one in his pocket. tex sits next to them while gideon nervously paces the floor. when gideon begins sneezing he takes the small bottle of pills from his pocket and downs one or two, swallowing some water.}
<C>__{scobie}
<D>__{hey, tex move the kid to the other knee or something, will you? my leg's going to sleep.}
<A>__{tex lifts jean louis and puts him down on scobie's other knee.}
<C>__{tex}
<D>__{upsy daisy. jean louis are you a real cowboy?}
<C>__{tex}
<D>__{sure am. jean louis then where is your gun?}
<C>__{tex}
<P>__{(taking out his gun)}
<D>__{right here see?}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{will you put that thing away!}
<A>__{a knock at the door. gideon goes to open it. reggie and dyle enter. she sees jean louis and tex's gun.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{jean louis!}
<A>__{she snatches him off scobie's lap.}
<C>__{tex}
<D>__{howdy, miz lampert.}
<C>__{scobie}
<P>__{(glaring at dyle)}
<D>__{who invited you?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{hello, herman, it was a happy landing, i see.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{i'd better call sylvie she must be frantic.}
<A>__{she starts for the door with jean louis. gideon blocks her way.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{i'm afraid that will have to wait, mrs. lampert.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{but his mother }
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{she isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.}
<C>__{tex}
<D>__{this ain't no game, miz lampert.}
<C>__{scobie}
<D>__{we want that money now!}
<C>__{dyle}
<P>__{(forcefully)}
<D>__{be quiet, all of you!}
<A>__{the three men look at him, surprised by his tone.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{and stop threatening that boy. he doesn't have the money. mrs. lampert doesn't either.}
<C>__{scobie}
<D>__{then who does?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{i don't know, herman maybe you do.}
<C>__{scobie}
<D>__{me?}
<C>__{dyle}
<P>__{(to tex)}
<D>__{or you }
<P>__{(to gideon)}
<D>__{or you gideon, tex & scobie}
<P>__{(together)}
<D>__{that's the most ridiculous ! you gone loco? listen to the man!}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{slowly. suppose one of you found charles here in paris, followed him, cornered him on the train, threw him out the window and took the money.}
<C>__{scobie}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{that's a crock! if one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{but he'd have to. if he left he'd be admitting his guilt and the others would know what happened. whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. that's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.}
<A>__{a pause as the three men look at one another.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{up till now we always figured she had the money but you know so much about it, maybe you've got it.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{then what am i doing here? you didn't know anything about me i'm the only one who could have taken it and kept right on going.}
<C>__{scobie}
<D>__{he's just tryin' to throw us off! they've got it, i tell you! why don't we search their rooms?}
<C>__{dyle}
<P>__{(exchanging looks with reggie)}
<D>__{it's all right with us }
<C>__{tex}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{what are we wastin' time for? let's go.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{and while we're waiting, we might as well go through yours.}
<C>__{scobie}
<P>__{(stopping)}
<D>__{not my room!}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{what's wrong, herman have you got something to hide?}
<P>__{(a pause, then smiling)}
<D>__{then i take it there are no objections.}
<A>__{the three men look at one another unhappily.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{we'd better exchange keys. here's mine.}
<C>__{scobie}
<D>__{i will take that.}
<A>__{he takes dyle's key and gives dyle his. gideon goes to reggie, takes her key and gives her his own.}
<C>__{tex}
<D>__{mine's in the door. ariva durchy, y'all.}
<A>__{the three men file out. dyle and reggie exchange looks.}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{come on let's get busy. who gets your vote?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{scobie he's the one that objected.}
<C>__{dyle}
<P>__{(handing her the boy)}
<D>__{he's all yours. i will do tex and gideon. take jean louis with you and make sure you bolt the door from inside.}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{viens, jean louis we're going to have a treasure hunt. jean louis}
<P>__{(joining them)}
<D>__{oh, la! if i find the treasure, will i win a prize?}
<C>__{reggie}
<P>__{(to dyle)}
<D>__{what should we give him?}
<C>__{dyle}
<D>__{how about $25,000? or do you think it would spoil him?}
<A>__{she smiles, takes jean louis' hand and leaves. dyle turns to survey tex's room. he goes first to the drawer in the night table empty; and the bed, looking in it and under it. then he goes to the desk and opens the drawers also empty. the bureau is next he opens all three double drawers and they, too, are completely empty. frowning, he goes to the armoire and opens it shelves and hanging bar are likewise bare. then, camera panning down, he sees the only thing he's found so far in the room a pair of fine cowboy boots.}
