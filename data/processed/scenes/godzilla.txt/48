<B>__{an enormous foot}
<A>__{comes crashing down atop jfk highway, crushing it. the transit bus tumbles off the demolished highway. the man in the market truck is tossed and enormous teeth puncture the top and bottom of his truck as it's lifted in the air. the man leaps from the open back of the truck. he lands, hard, down in front of one of the fish market stores as hundreds of fish rain down from above. with a loud crash, the demolished truck slams to the ground nearby.}
