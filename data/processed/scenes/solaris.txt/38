<A>__{rheya's lips. except the circumstance is clearly different: it's darker and there isn't the side to side shimmy of the train car.}

<A>__{reveals that rheya is not sitting on the train she is sitting in kelvin's room on the prometheus, right now. she is staring at kelvin and she is ethereal in her stillness.}
<B>__{kelvin}
<A>__{awakens, blinks, and slowly recognizes her. if he is not entirely surprised it is because he has obviously dreamed of rheya before. he looks at her, simply.}
<B>__{rheya}
