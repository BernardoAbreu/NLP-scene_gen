<L>__{interior storage lab day}
<A>__{a large crowd has been gathered here at the lab. general grey and nimziki walk up to constance.}
<C>__{nimziki}
<D>__{all right, connie, we're here. what's this all about?}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{i really have no idea. he just said to bring everyone down here.}
<A>__{steve shows dylan the alien space craft.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{does that thing fly in outer space?}
<A>__{steve loos up at the craft admiringly.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{it certainly does.}
<A>__{when the president enters a technician rushes over and knocks on the hatch door on the alien attacker. the door swings open and david climbs down. grabbing a coke can from the "recycle" trash bin, david places the empty can on top of the alien attacker. david turns and faces the gathering.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{could anyone please step back away from the craft?}
<A>__{they do and david nods to a technician inside the craft. the technician disappears inside, closing the door behind him. a loud hum emits from the craft. david has to yell over it.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{lt. mitchell, would you mind drawing your pistol?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{from where you're standing, do you think you could shoot that can off the alien craft?}
<A>__{mitchell shrugs affirmatively. david gestures for him to try. taking aim, mitchell shoots. the bullet ricochets off the attacker's protective shield. several people in the crowd dock, afraid of being hit by the errant bullet.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{sorry 'bout that. you see, it's protected by the craft's shields. we can't penetrate their defenses.}
<C>__{nimziki}
<D>__{we know that already. what's your point?}
<A>__{david walks over to his laptop, now connected directly to the craft by cables and starts typing furiously.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{my point is if we can't beat their defenses, then we must get}
<A>__{around}
<D>__{them.}
<A>__{david stops typing and stares at his wrist watch, silently counting down.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{lt. mitchell, would you please try to shoot it again?}
<A>__{reluctantly mitchell obliges. this time the can is blown off the craft. everyone in the room is shocked. the technician re opens the craft's door and the loud hum disappears.}
<C>__{general grey}
<D>__{how did you do that?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i gave it a cold.}
<A>__{the president is fascinated, he steps closer. moishe beams proudly at his smart son. constance is amazed.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{more accurately, i gave it a virus. a computer virus.}
<A>__{david turns his laptop around for the president to see.}
<C>__{general grey}
<D>__{are you telling us you can send out a signal that will disable all their shields?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{just as they used our satellites against us, we can use their own signal against them.}
<A>__{david walks over to a diagram he's made showing the relationship between the mother ship, the space crafts and the smaller alien attackers.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{if we plant the virus directly into the mother ship, it would then filter down into all the corresponding ships below.}
<C>__{nimziki}
<D>__{and just how do we infect the "mother ship" with a virus?}
<A>__{david gestures to the alien attacker behind him.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we'll have to fly their craft out of our atmosphere and dock with the mother ship.}
<A>__{intrigued steve turns and looks back at the alien attacker, sizing it up. david points to a satellite photo of the underbelly of the mother ship.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{we can enter here, upload the virus and set off an explosion that could disable it. this would disorient the smaller ship below and buy you some time to take them out.}
<A>__{constance reacts, realizing david's participation in the plan.}
<C>__{nimziki}
<D>__{this is ridiculous.}
<C>__{general grey}
<D>__{how long would their shields be down?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{once they discover the virus it could be a matter of minutes.}
<C>__{nimziki}
<D>__{you want us to co ordinate a massive world wide counter strike with a window of only a few minutes?}
<C>__{general grey}
<D>__{with their shields down it might be possible.}
<C>__{nimziki}
<D>__{please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? we don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.}
<P>__{(gesturing to the alien ship)}
<D>__{not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.}
<C>__{steve }
<D>__{i wouldn't say that, sir.}
<A>__{everyone turns to steve who steps through the crowd.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i've seen them in action. i've watched their maneuvers. with your permission, sir, i'd like the opportunity to try.}
<C>__{nimziki}
<D>__{that thing's a wreck. it crash landed back in the fifties! we don't even know if it's}
<A>__{capable of}
<D>__{flying.}
<A>__{david turns to the technicians.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{remove the clamps!}
<A>__{technicians move to the large holding clamps on either side of the craft. with a loud clank, the clamps are pulled away. for a moment the hulking craft teeters unevenly, but quickly stabilizes, floating above them.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{any other questions?}
<A>__{everyone stares at the floating ship with wonder.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{let's do it.}
