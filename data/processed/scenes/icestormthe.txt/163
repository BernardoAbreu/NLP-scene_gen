<T>__{jump cut to:}
<A>__{the gadds choose each other.}
<C>__{mrs. gadd}
<D>__{oh, my own husband. isn't that against the rules?}
<C>__{dot}
<D>__{try again?}
<C>__{mrs. gadd}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{oh, i think not.}
<A>__{mr. gadd smiles as they leave, obviously happy to go. finally, only mark boland, neil conrad, janey and jim williams, rob and dot halford, sari steele, benjamin and elena.}
<C>__{dot}
<D>__{getting down to the wire!}
<A>__{elena steps forward. benjamin is obviously agitated. close on janey's hands selecting away from ben's equine key ring. she lifts up another key ring neil conrad, the teenager. she hands the self important looking neil his keys and they turn to go. jim williams smiles mysteriously to himself. ben suddenly lurches forward, semi drunkenly, trying to separate neil from janey.}
<C>__{the group}
<P>__{(ad lib)}
<D>__{hey hey ben, hang on there a sec.}
<A>__{he backs off, ashamed, and, taking a step backwards, trips over the coffee table. mark boland helps lift him up.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{sorry... maybe i should... the bathroom?}
<C>__{dot}
<D>__{right down the hall, ben.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{sorry, i'm sorry. uh, i will be back.}
<A>__{dot follows mark boland down the hall behind ben. suddenly, it's just elena and jim williams, and sari steele and rob halford.}
<C>__{rob halford}
<P>__{(taking sari's arm)}
<D>__{actually, we didn't put our keys in at all. but you won't spread it around? it's my party, and dot isn't... hey, we're just going to slip upstairs for a while. you folks like a cup of coffee or something before we go?}
<A>__{elena and jim look at each other.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{rob, we'll fix it for ourselves. you two go and get acquainted. we'll let ourselves out the front door.}
<A>__{jim and elena stand there alone.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, i have to say i don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{let me.}
<A>__{she takes the bowl and dips her hand in. two sets are left. one, her own, she avoids. she takes out jim's keys and walks across the room, handing them to him.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{thanks, but oh, i don't think so. it's been kind of a discouraging evening.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{you couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{somehow it was different in my imagination when i thought about it. actually, i didn't think about it at all, really.}
<A>__{they sit down on the sofa.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you want coffee or something?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{look, elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{my husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. i've been married to him for 17 years and i don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what i'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, i'm proposing that you and i do what makes sense. stay warm. pass some time. that's all.}
<A>__{they both look at their hands.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{now don't make me feel as if i'm being too forward, ok? if you don't }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what the hey. let's go for a drive.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{okay. shall we clean up around here first? do you think it's all right }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{nah, that wasn't in the contract.}
<A>__{but they still walk around turning off lights. in the hallway, elena looks a bit mournfully at the light seeping from underneath the bathroom door. she hears the sound of running water from inside. then she goes into a sideroom and joins jim. they pick up their coats.}
