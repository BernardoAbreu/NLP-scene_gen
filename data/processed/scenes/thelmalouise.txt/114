<L>__{interior thelma's motel room night}
<A>__{thelma has poured a drink for j.d. who's sitting on the edge of the bed. she walks over and hands it to him and as she does, he takes the drink with one hand and her hand with the other. he sets the drink down on the nightstand and holds her hand with both of his. he closely studies her wedding ring. he suddenly looks up at her and gazes at her just as intently. he slowly shakes his head as he removes her ring as if to say, "this is not right for you. this isn't going to work." he looks at the ring as he moves it through space finally stopping when the ring is directly over his drink. he drops it in. he looks back at thelma and smiles as if to say, "there. now don't you feel better?" he smartly kisses her hand.}
