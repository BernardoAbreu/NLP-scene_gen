<L>__{interior back room, workshop night}
<A>__{close on a small brass chess piece. ariadne tips it over. frowning, she picks up a micro drill, peels back the felt on the bottom and widens a hole in one side of its base. tests the tipping point again. a noise makes her look up.}
<L>__{interior workshop continuous}
<A>__{ariadne comes into the main space. someone is there, unpacking one of the mechanisms. cobb.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{you're back.}
<A>__{cobb looks up with a start. caught out.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{are you going under on your own?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i just i need to test some things. i didn't realize anyone was here.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{just working on my totem.}
<A>__{ariadne holds up the chess piece. cobb reaches for it.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{let me see }
<A>__{ariadne snaps it out of his reach. smiles. cobb nods.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you're learning.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{it's an elegant solution to keeping track of reality. your invention?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{no. mal's.}
<A>__{cobb pulls out his spinning top. looks at it.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{this one was hers. she'd spin it in a dream and it would never topple. just spin and spin...}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{arthur told me she died.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{she did. how are the mazes coming?}
<A>__{ariadne indicates three large architectural models.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{good. each level relates to the part of the subject's subconscious we're trying to access. i'm making the bottom level a hospital, so that fischer will bring his father there }
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{don't tell me. remember, you only want the dreamer to know the layout.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{why's that so important?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{in case one of us brings in part of our subconscious. you wouldn't want any projections knowing the layout.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{in case you bring mal in.}
<A>__{cobb says nothing.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{you won't build yourself because if you know the maze, then she knows it. and she'd sabotage the operation. you can't keep her out, can you?}
<A>__{cobb says nothing.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{do the others know?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{you have to warn them if it's getting worse }
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(gentle)}
<D>__{i didn't say it's getting worse. look, ariadne, i need them for this job. i need you for this job. without your help, i will never get back to my children. and that's all i can care about right now.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{why can't you go home, cobb?}
<A>__{cobb looks at her, deciding what to say.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{they think i killed her.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{how did she die?}
<A>__{cobb thinks. insert cut: mal, wind blowing her hair, smiles at cobb. now we see cobb shaking his head, tears streaming, begging }
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{not asking whether i did.}
