<D>__{i'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.}
<C>__{st. luc }
<D>__{i've got a date with one of them at ten. can you make it?}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{ah, i don't want to panic you or anything, but, i mean, the way hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... i dunno. but if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...}
<C>__{st. luc }
<P>__{(laughing: he doesn't}
<D>__{take this aspect too}
<P>__{seriously)}
<D>__{yeah? what do i do then?}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{i dunno. try tranquilizers. once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. i will bring a bagful. it's just the standard tropical kit. but the trick is to get at them.}
