<L>__{interior keating's classroom day}
<A>__{keating sits at his desk at the front of the classroom and opens up one of his books.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{gentlemen, open your text to page twenty one of the introduction. mr. perry, will you read the opening paragraph of the preface, entitled "understanding poetry"?}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{understanding poetry, by dr. j. evans pritchard, ph.d. to fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech. then ask two questions: one, how artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered, and two, how important is that objective. question one rates the poem's perfection, question two rates its importance. and once these questions have been answered, determining a poem's greatest becomes a relatively simple matter.}
<A>__{keating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{if the poem's score for perfection is plotted along the horizontal of a graph, and its importance is plotted on the vertical, then calculating the total area of the poem yields the measure of its greatness.}
<A>__{keating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the students dutifully copy it down.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{a sonnet by byron may score high on the vertical, but only average on the horizontal. a shakespearean sonnet, on the other hand, would score high both horizontally and vertically, yielding a massive total area, thereby revealing the poem to be truly great. as you proceed through the poetry in this book, practice this rating method. as your ability to evaluate poems in this matter grows, so will so will your enjoyment and understanding of poetry.}
<A>__{neil sets the book down and takes off his glasses. the student sitting across from him is discretely trying to eat. keating turns away from the chalkboard with a smile.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{excrement. that's what i think of mr. j. evans pritchard. we're not laying pipe, we're talking about poetry.}
<A>__{cameron looks down at the graph he copied into his notes and quickly scribbles it out.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{i mean, how can you describe poetry like american bandstand? i like byron, i give him a 42, but i can't dance to it.}
<A>__{charlie suddenly appear to become interested in the class.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{now i want you to rip out that page.}
<A>__{the students look at keating as if he has just gone mad.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{go on, rip out the entire page. you heard me, rip it out. rip it out!}
<A>__{charlie looks around at the others. he then looks down at his own notes, which consists of drawing breasts.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{go on, rip it out.}
<A>__{charlie rips the page out and holds it up.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{thank you mr. dalton. gentlemen, tell you what, don't just tear out that page, tear out the entire introduction. i want it gone, history. leave nothing of it. rip it out. rip! begone j. evans pritchard, ph.d. rip, shred, tear. rip it out. i want to hear nothing but ripping of mr. pritchard.}
<A>__{meeks looks around reluctantly and then finally begins tearing out pages.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{we'll perforate it, put it on a roll.}
<A>__{keating sees cameron still hesitating.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{it's not the bible, you're not going to go to hell for this. go on, make a clean tear, i want nothing left of it.}
<A>__{keating goes over to his room. cameron turns around to neil.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{we shouldn't be doing this.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{rip, rip, rip!}
<A>__{neil makes cameron turn back around.}
<C>__{keating }
<D>__{rip it out, rip!}
<A>__{from outside the classroom, mr. mcallister hears all the noise and sees all the students ripping out the pages. he bursts into the room.}
<C>__{mcallister}
<D>__{what the hell is going on here?}
<A>__{the boys all turn around in shock. charlie stuffs a crumpled page into his mouth. keating emerges from his room with a waste paper basket.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{i don't hear enough rips.}
<C>__{mcallister}
<D>__{mr. keating.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{mr. mcallister.}
<C>__{mcallister}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i i didn't know you were here.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{mcallister}
<D>__{ahh, so you are. excuse me.}
<A>__{mr. mcallister slowly backs out of the classroom.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{keep ripping gentlemen. this is a battle, a war. and the casualties could be your hearts and souls.}
<A>__{keating holds out the basket to charlie who spits out a wad of paper.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{thank you mr. dalton. armies of academics going forward, measuring poetry. no, we will not have that here. no more of mr. j. evans pritchard. now in my class you will learn to think for yourselves again. you will learn to savor words and language. no matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world. i see that look in mr. pitt's eye, like nineteenth century literature has nothing to do with going to business school or medical school. right? maybe. mr. hopkins, you may agree with him, thinking "yes, we should simply study our mr. pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter and go quietly about the business of achieving other ambitions." i have a little secret for ya. huddle up. huddle up!}
<A>__{the boys get up from their seats and gather around keating in the center of the class.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{we don't read and write poetry because it's cute. we read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. and the human race is filled with passion. medicine, law, business, engineering, these are all noble pursuits, and necessary to sustain life. but poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. to quote from whitman: "o me, o life of the questions of these recurring, of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities filled with the foolish. what good amid these, o me, o life? answer: that you are here. that life exists, and identity. that the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse. that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse.}
<A>__{keating looks up at todd.}
<D>__{keating what will your verse be?}
