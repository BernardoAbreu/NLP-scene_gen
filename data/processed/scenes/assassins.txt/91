<L>__{exterior alley}
<A>__{bain rushes into the street, looking in every direction. they are gone.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{fuck me!}
<L>__{exterior large chain hotel night}
<A>__{somewhere in the city.}
<L>__{interior hotel room}
<A>__{electra and rath enter the room together but they are both immediately alone. she walks across the room to a chair in the corner, curling into it even as nikita jumps up and curls into her lap. he sets his briefcase on the table at the opposite end of the room and sits. they watch each other. silence. between then is the liquor cabinet. rath knows a good idea when he sees one.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{want a drink?}
<A>__{her face is as expressionless as nikita's. he pours himself a very large bourbon and slugs it down. takes a deep breath, then pours himself another one.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{okay...}
<A>__{he returns to his table with his drink.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i'm not good at this sort of thing, but we don't have a lot of time, so i will just go ahead and get started. first: you. i ask myself, 'what is she thinking?'}
<A>__{her body tightens, coils.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{simple. she's scared. she's almost been killed twice and now she is alone in a room with a man that she believes is an... assassin.}
<A>__{another deep pull on the bourbon.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{furthermore she was brought here not entirely on her own accord which only increases her fear and suspicion. thus, as long as she is afraid, her first, maybe her only thought will be escape. does that leave me any other option?}
<A>__{he slugs down the rest of his drink and stands, whipping out his gun.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{crossing the room, he turns the gun around and offers it to her. she looks at it. back at him. he puts it on the bed beside her, turns his back and walks to the bar. she picks up the gun.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{the gun is silenced. she could shoot me right now.}
<A>__{she stands, nikita jumping from her lap.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{she could take the car and be far from here before the maid comes in the morning, but }
<A>__{she starts squeezing off rounds; the lamp explodes, the chairs around him erupt, tufts of white stuffing leaping into the air.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{he freezes, bottle in one hand, glass in the other.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{stop trying to tell me what i'm thinking!}
<A>__{she moves closer to him, the gun squeezed in her fist.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i will tell you what you're thinking you think i'm not going to shoot you but right now you're not so sure, are you?}
<A>__{a slight shake of the head, no.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you're thinking that maybe it was a mistake to give me this gun, that maybe i'm not going to think about things logically because i'm a woman and i'm freaked out and i'm going to do something impulsive and irrational right?}
<A>__{she fires the gun to both sides of his head. he's surprised to be alive.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you don't know shit about me! now sit down!}
<A>__{he returns to his chair and sits with the same expression she had worn sitting a moment ago. she opens the cabinet and grabs one of the sample bottles of liquor. she sucks it all down and throws the bottle across the room. grabbing another, she sits on the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{okay. how did you find me?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you're the computer hacker, you tell me.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you didn't know anything about me.}
<A>__{nikita rubs up against her leg.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{nikita?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yellow pages. v for veterinarian. there aren't that many.}
<A>__{she nods, slurping at her bottle.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you're one of them, aren't you?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{'them'?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{an assassin?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{until a minute ago.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{if i still was what i used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.}
<A>__{electra eyes him, considers shooting him right now.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{who is that other guy?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{another contractor.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{someone hired both of you?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no. they hired bain. the contract would have been mine, but bain took it from me as he took the previous one.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{so this is something between you and him?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{he stole the contract knowing that i would come after him.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{because he is trying to retire me.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{he wants to kill you?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{the nature of the business. you remove your competition.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{and you want to use me to get him?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{forget it!}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{we don't have a choice.}
<A>__{she fires the gun, pocking the wall behind him.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{don't tell me i don't have a choice!}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why i shouldn't shoot you.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{it's simple. you need me. i need you. and we will both need money.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i don't need you to get the money my money!}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{if it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.}
<A>__{she's up pacing, knowing there is some truth in that.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i don't need the money.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{this is something that is never going to end. you can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. to survive, you have to go into deep hiding. and that's going to take money, a lot of money.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{then you can have the disks and i will just walk out that door }
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{if you walk out that door, bain will still come after you.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{because he took a contract on you. he'll come for you and he'll find you.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you don't know that you're trying to scare me.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no. it's the truth. i know what you are. like me, like bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world. you don't have a social security number. you don't pay taxes. you've probably used ten different names over the last ten years. a long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy. you think you can do it again. but i'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing. no matter what you do, where you go, i swear to you that bain will find you.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment. he is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets. he will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books. if you keep a diary, he is reading it. he'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke. in the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled. if you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.}
<A>__{she is coming unglued. imagining him watching her tapes, going through her possessions. she is moving, pacing, ready to explode.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{oh jesus jesus...}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{he will know everything about you. everything. i know, because i've done it. once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. if you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and bain is good because i was the best and i couldn't take him.}
<A>__{she whirls and starts firing the gun, firing it everywhere, fear and anger rocketing out of her in whistling hot wads of lead. when she stops, he starts to say something but she levels the gun at him.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{shut up! all right! you've said enough!}
<A>__{she forces herself back, grabbing handfuls of the sample bottles.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i need to think... to be alone.}
<A>__{with the gun and an armful of booze and nikita following at her feet, she goes into the bathroom and slams the door.}
