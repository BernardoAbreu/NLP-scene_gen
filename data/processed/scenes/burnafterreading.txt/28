<L>__{interior exam room day}
<A>__{a woman's ass bare. pale. middle aged. someone with a marker is drawing on the flesh to illustrate:}
<C>__{doctor }
<D>__{we take all the chicken fat off your buttocks, here... and here... and the upper arms. and a little off your tummy...}
<A>__{the camera is arcing around a standing, naked, middle aged woman, to reveal the doctor sitting on a stool in the examining room, facing her. he reaches forward again with the marker.}
<D>__{doctor (off) (cont'd) ...and we do breast augmentation with a tiny incision here... and here.}
<C>__{patient }
<D>__{uh huh. and what about the thigh area?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{well we can do liposuction there as well, but that area will respond to exercise. buttocks and upper arms begin to store more fat when you get up around forty, the body just tells it to go there, but the thighs will respond to toning exercises.}
<C>__{patient}
<D>__{uh huh. i know, i can work out on my arms til the cows come home, but...}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{uh huh. and of course there are also genetic factors.}
<C>__{patient}
<D>__{the litzkes are big.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{uh huh, well everything's }
<C>__{patient}
<D>__{my mom had an ass that could pull a bus.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{wow. well that's a predispo }
<C>__{patient}
<D>__{father's side too, although dad tends to carry his weight in front of him.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{patient}
<D>__{in the gut area. derriere, not so much.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{the continuing track around is also booming up to reveal the face of the patient, linda litzke.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{and what about the face, you know, the window to the soul.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{uh huh! uh huh! very well put. well your eyes are one of your best features. but we can do something about the incipient crow's feet.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{baby crow's feet. little chickling's feet. i mean chicks. chickie chickie chickie.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{ha ha, yes, again, well put. you have a way with words. we cut here...}
<A>__{he marks.}
<C>__{doctor }
<D>__{... and we pull the skin tight, like stretching the skin over a drum. not too tight, though. we don't want that "worked on" look. you need sufficient slack for the face to remain expressive.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{yeah, i don't wanna look like boris karloff.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{uh huh! heh heh, so you don't want a sex change!}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{no, i'm all woman!}
