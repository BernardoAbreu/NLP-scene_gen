<A>__{clyde, stevie, and brad are loitering near the front bike racks. clyde's smoking away. as geoff and drew come out of the school, the trio moves to intercept them.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{just then, chase's van pulls at the curb, interrupting whatever trouble was about to happen. clyde looks from the van to geoff, and falls back.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{saved by the bell...}
<A>__{chase hurriedly rolls down the passenger window as geoff and drew approach.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{can i sleep over at drew's tonight?}
<A>__{chase is preoccupied with other concerns.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{yeah... that's fine...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{listen, drew, i got the tests back on zowie. he's not well. don't ask me how, but he got out this afternoon...}
<A>__{geoff and drew exchange concerned looks.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{if he finds his way home, call me, no matter what the hour, okay? and don't try to approach him. whatever he's got might be infectious. understand?}
<A>__{the boys nod their heads. chase masks his anxiety with a weary smile. with a wave, he speeds up, leaving the boys.}
