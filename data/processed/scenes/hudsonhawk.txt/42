<L>__{interior exterior circular open air hallway}
<A>__{hawk comes out onto a circular open air hallway. he scans up to some rooftops and makes a note...until he sees a line of international phone boothettes. checking for flunkies, he rips one up.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{operator, i want to make a collect call to alex messina, new york....}
<A>__{the flunkies drift into view. hawk hangs up and seethes off.}
<L>__{interior hallway leading to codex room}
<A>__{hawk saunters down a long resplendent hallway toward a room at the end bustling with excitement. coming to the mouth of the room, he looks to two gold framed mirrors on either side of the opening, rubs his head, and scribbles.}
<B>__{inside the codex room}
<A>__{hawk takes in the majestic beauty, and practical details, of the room windows, statues, a massive ornate lighting fixture as he moves down one of the twin winding stair cases leading to a path of people behind velvet ropes and the object of their gaze...}
<B>__{the da vinci codex}
<A>__{ an old book enclosed in a glass case, propped open to the familiar beautiful drawing of a man inside a circle. the case is located between two informational tablets enclosed in glass columns. enter holy da vinci theme.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{but it is his gift as an inventor who drew together science and art that is most incredible.}
<A>__{hawk brightens to the return of anna, carrying a portfolio bag, striding down the stairs with a group of investors and families. she brightens back, giving him a quick verbal breath and a hand squeeze.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{tough guy. what are you how's your head.}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(vegetable)}
<D>__{yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...}
<A>__{she laughs, going into her public voice.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{as you know, the da vinci codex, has lived in the vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{that's what you theenk.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{question, sir? his untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.}
<A>__{a little brat trailing the group, moves next to hawk, bitching away to her stuffed elephant, pokey.}
<C>__{little brat}
<D>__{this is so bor ing! do you hate italy as much as i do, pokey?}
<P>__{(bad ventriloquism)}
<D>__{si, senor! italy sucks the big one! why can't we go to the epcot center!}
<A>__{the little brat stops and lets pokey the elephant dangle from her side. hawk eyes the elephant strangely.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{these more dangerous designs inspired him to develop a secret code that ....}
<A>__{the stuffed elephant suddenly goes flying over anna's head. the alarm goes off. the massive ornate lighting fixture swoops down from the ceiling, inverting in air, and slams down over the codex, transformed into a makeshift cage. strange green gas comes billowing out of the vents. needless to say, everyone goes crazy. coughing gas, hawk peeks to see that a line of light sensor alarms imbedded in the tablets are what set the alarm off. two gas masks drop airlinesquely from the mouth of the entranceway and two racing in guards wrangle them on. the little brat sees that pokey the stuffed elephant has been beheaded by the cage lamp. she is pulled away and spanked.}
<C>__{little brat}
<D>__{pokey, come back!}
<A>__{anna yanks a notetaking hawk away as the gas blusters in around him. the two flunkies, eyes on hawk, are hap lessly making their way up the opposite staircase.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{come on, this stuff will knock you out. have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, mr. bond.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{never, why do you ask?}
<A>__{reaching the top of the stairs, just outside the door, anna briskly pulls hawk into a piece of wall that is really a door. the wall closes as the flunkies come flying out, baffled.}
