<L>__{interior saucier municipal building day}
<A>__{we hear snoring on top of a low, steady hissing sound. we are drifting toward the door of the lock up, which stands open. the small cell is empty, its bed neatly made.}
<B>__{a key}
<A>__{we are arcing slowly around a jailer's key on a ring that hangs from a nail. the offscreen snoring and whirring continues. the track's shifting angle now makes the light catch a spider web spun between the key and the wall.}
<B>__{police scanner}
<A>__{we drift across the face of the radio. the peaceful steady hissing jumps in louder at the cut: it is uninterrupted: a transmissionless, crimeless, misdemeanorless idle radio hiss. the snoring is also louder here. as we travel off the radio we are coming onto a pair of feet propped up on the desktop. they belong to sheriff wyner, tipped back in his chair, fingers laced on his chest, head lolling forward. as the moving camera finally ends on him, there is the ring of a telephone muffled, not present. it nevertheless rouses the sheriff who almost strangles on a snore as he awakes, and then rocks forward to pick up his phone.}
<C>__{sheriff wyner}
<D>__{sheriff wyner...}
<A>__{the muffled ringing continues; the sheriff looks, puzzled, at the phone. now the ringing stops and we hear a muffled voice next door:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{worms.}
<A>__{the sheriff replaces the phone, leans back again, adjusts his hat, and is about to go back to sleep when we hear the front door open. the sheriff looks and reacts with genuine, if momentary, fear. he manages to compose himself and give the intruder a smile:}
