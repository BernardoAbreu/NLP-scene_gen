<L>__{interior closet}
<A>__{in almost complete darkness, a very nervous eighth grade olive (13) sits with a scared shitless eighth grade kid (13). you can hear other pre teens snickering and whispering outside the door.}
<C>__{eighth grade olive}
<D>__{so, i think this is the part where you're supposed to stick your tongue in my mouth. it's just what i've heard.}
<C>__{eighth grade kid}
<D>__{just give me a second, okay?}
<A>__{olive presses a button and her watch illuminates.}
<C>__{eighth grade olive}
<D>__{according to my watch, you have 382 of them.}
<C>__{eighth grade kid}
<D>__{how do you do that?}
<C>__{eighth grade olive}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{eighth grade kid}
<D>__{add so fast. and you also talk like a grown up.}
<C>__{eighth grade olive}
<D>__{don't worry. i'm not nearly as smart as i think i am.}
<A>__{the kid snickers. he feels a little more at ease.}
<C>__{eighth grade olive }
<D>__{i think it's just practice. for when i do grow up. plus, don't sweat it. girls mature faster than boys.}
<C>__{eighth grade kid}
<D>__{that's what they say.}
<C>__{eighth grade olive}
<D>__{and it's probably the reason i'm ready to do this and you're not.}
<C>__{eighth grade kid}
<D>__{is it that obvious?}
<C>__{eighth grade olive}
<D>__{painfully so.}
<C>__{eighth grade kid}
<D>__{so, if we didn't do anything, would you tell everybody?}
<C>__{eighth grade olive}
<D>__{absolutely. i will tell everyone you pussied out and the whole school will make fun of you and you'll most likely spend the rest of your teen years as a joke no, even worse a cautionary tale.}
<A>__{they both laugh.}
<C>__{eighth grade kid}
<D>__{the kid who opted not to kiss the girl.}
<C>__{eighth grade olive}
<D>__{they'll tell it for years. it'll be a suburban legend.}
<A>__{the kid smiles warmly and gratefully at her.}
<C>__{eighth grade kid}
<D>__{thanks, olive.}
<C>__{eighth grade olive}
<D>__{don't mention it.}
<C>__{eighth grade kid}
<D>__{no. you don't mention it.}
<A>__{she extends her pinky to him. they link pinkies and they swear on it.}
<C>__{eighth grade olive}
<D>__{we still have five minutes and thirty six seconds.}
<A>__{there's a long silence.}
<C>__{eighth grade kid}
<D>__{i'm really interested in politics.}
<C>__{eighth grade olive}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{eighth grade kid}
<D>__{totally.}
<C>__{eighth grade olive}
<D>__{well,... uh.... cool.}
<A>__{there's another long silence. finally, from outside the door}
<D>__{ }
<C>__{preteen kid }
<D>__{ewwwww. hunter neblett just puked all over the dining room.}
<A>__{olive and the kid listen as people scurry from outside the closet.}
<C>__{eighth grade kid}
<D>__{thank god.}
<C>__{eighth grade olive}
<D>__{hey, we're in junior high. vomit viewing will always trump spit swapping.}
<A>__{the kid starts to make his grand escape, but olive stops him.}
<C>__{eighth grade olive }
<D>__{real fast and you can tell me the truth. it's not because i'm }
<A>__{the kid smiles.}
<C>__{eighth grade kid}
<D>__{no. you're very pretty.}
<A>__{he extends his pinky and she links it to hers. he kisses her quickly on the cheek and darts from the closet. olive sits in the closet for a moment, contemplating what just happened, wondering if he was telling the truth, then she opens the door. the coast is clear, except for another preteen kid walking past. she aggressively grabs him and pulls him into the closet with her and, promptly, thrusts her tongue into his mouth. they make out.}
