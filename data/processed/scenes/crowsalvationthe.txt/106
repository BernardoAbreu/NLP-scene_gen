<L>__{exterior remote road forest night}
<A>__{far above a solitary car winding through an old growth forest, its headlights stabbing the darkness. the crow soars into frame, watching.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior old growth grove night}
<A>__{a simple wooden cross illuminated by the headlights of the big benz as it pulls off the road into the grove of huge trees dripping with moss. in the benz erin blank as she turns off the car, leaving the headlights on. silence. with erin as she steps from the car, walks toward the cross. partway there... caw! erin looks up, finds the crow fluttering in to perch high overhead. alex emerges from behind a tree, near the cross.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{this is where it happened. right over here.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{yeah, i know.}
<A>__{she stays where she is. alex quiet, affected by the place. erin's about to lose it.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{are you ok?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{when lauren was missing the police came to our house. they said they were looking for her, right?}
<P>__{(breaking down)}
<D>__{but i know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{... is that i sent them here. i told them she came here sometimes. with her dirtball boyfriend. that's exactly what i said.}
<A>__{she's crying softly. he draws nearer.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{erin. it's not your fault.}
<C>__{erin}
<P>__{(losing it now)}
<D>__{it's all my fault. oh god. i wish i were dead.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{no. you don't.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{yes i do, i really do.}
<A>__{seeming to lose patience, alex lunges at her, like an attack.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{there were four of them.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{he's holding his hands over her eyes, transferring images that shake them both. alex erin's internal pov jolting flashes. a plainwrap stops where the mercedes is now. a hand slams the car into park. doors open. four men get out, seen dimly, but they're dutton, erlich, larkin, toomey. erlich reaches back in to drag lauren out of the back seat, her hands cuffed in front of her. dutton flips up her skirt with his nightstick.}
<C>__{alex's voice}
<D>__{four large men. and still...}
<A>__{lauren stumbles into erlich, grabs and bam! flash! he takes a shot in the leg from his own, still holstered weapon.}
<C>__{alex's voice }
<D>__{she grabbed one of their guns. got off a shot, then ran, ran for her life.}
<A>__{resume present erin's covering her face, like trying to avoid seeing some horrible thing.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{i don't want to know.}
<A>__{alex grabs erin, forces her to run with him, awkwardly, like a three legged race. tracing the path lauren covered.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{she ran. them breathing down her neck...}
<A>__{erin stumbling as alex pushes, cajoles her, the two of them running toward a large tree, matching to... alex erin's internal pov lauren stumbling, her cuffed hands hindering, tree limbs hitting her face. her own panting subsumed in the panting of the cops on her heels.}
<C>__{alex's voice}
<D>__{... all the way from the road to this tree...}
<A>__{resume present erin still trying not to see. alex forcing her.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{this tree. here's where it happened.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{i don't want to see!}
<A>__{alex spins her up against the tree and we match to... alex erin's internal pov lauren an adrenaline crazed fighter destined to lose. her movements undercranked, strobed. discontinuous and jarring.}
<C>__{alex's voice}
<D>__{she turned and faced them and went down kicking and punching and fighting them, fighting death as they stabbed her and stabbed her. fifty three times.}
<A>__{the brutal cops overwhelm lauren. she drops to the ground as... resume erin drops to the forest floor, convulsed in sobs.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{she fought for her life because life is worth living.}
<A>__{alex panting. fierce.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{think about that. and then tell me how much you wish you were dead.}
<A>__{off erin, sobbing, heartbroken. alex's fury waning as he looks at her, wonders if he did the right thing.}
