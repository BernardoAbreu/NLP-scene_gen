<A>__{the glowing orb ripples like a blood red eye. black, robed figure a face of the ages. dark, wrinkled skin. wizened, almond eyes. he howls at the sun. his voice echoes across the sky. the moslem call to prayer. hundreds of feet below his tower, a mud walled city of minarets and mosques. a human ants' nest. scurrying to their devotions.}

<A>__{pervasive blackness. moans of men in pain. dripping water. rats. filth. the nadir of human degradation. bedraggled white men, pows from the crusades, caged together with arab cutthroats. jailers wrench two crusaders from their cell. robin of locksley and peter dubois. their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their faces. peter is so frail he can barely walk.}
