<A>__{as chang sleeps the heavy curtains are drawn to keep out the light of the day but they cannot deaden the sound of the city outside as it goes about its frenetic everyday business. the camera moves through the apartment, briefly settling on the sleeping chang, then roaming through the various rooms, picking out different objects... we see that chang is obsessed with cowboy films and a keen collector the sitting room is stuffed with movie posters, photographs and other bits of movie memorabilia... amongst the many family photos we also pick out several pictures of chang when he was in the army and shots of what looks like a very successful career as a thai boxer. at the end of the tour we're back with chang. we zoom in to a tight close shot.}
