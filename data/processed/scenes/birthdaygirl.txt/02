<A>__{an aerial shot of the rolling english countryside. nothing but fields and trees for miles. the shot describes a panorama before looking directly down, at the earth, and we begin to move. we fly low over a field, a ditch and straight out over six lanes of motorway. cars and lorries tear below at a hundred miles an hour. we fly over the hard shoulder to another field beyond. we descend on two young boys in the field. a pornographic magazine is spread out of the flattened grass. one of the boys puts a match to the centre page and as the flames lick up, we begin to move again, across the field, over a path and into a suburban garden. we fly over five or six gardens, over a barbecue, over children splashing in a pool, over a woman sunbathing, a man mowing his lawn, a young boy bouncing up and down on a garden trampoline, to arrive on the patio of john buckingham. he walks out onto the patio, where he sits in a chair, facing his house, setting down a mug of tea.}
