<L>__{interior hotel pub derby night (1969)}
<A>__{clough and taylor in a deserted bar. alone. a television plays in the corner. don revie's face on tv...}
<C>__{don revie }
<D>__{...obviously it's a terrific achievement for derby, being promoted to the first division, but the truth is leeds united have an unfortunate habit of reminding them just how far they still have to go..}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{arrogant twat..}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{but he's right. five nothing. they made us look like fools today. and what was john o'hare doing? letting madeley bully him like that.}
<C>__{clo ugh }
<D>__{push him around. madeley's half his bloody size. o'hare needs to toughen up. he's from scottish dockyards, isn't he? and what about john mcgovern? he was useless in the middle. who's idea was that?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{yours.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{he was all over the place. like the wandering jew. giving the ball to anyone but his own. we need a ball player, a natural in midfield. who'll hold onto it. keep possession. we're giving it away too easily.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{someone like colin todd.}
<C>__{clough}
<P>__{(sharp intake)}
<D>__{oooh, now you're talking. lovely pair of feet.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i've heard he wants out of sunderland, too. they're all jumping ship up there.}
<A>__{clough thinks for a moment, then...}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{well, go on then. sign him.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{what? we can't. longson's already told us. club's in debt.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{bollocks to that. i've not brought us all the way to the first division just to sit there mid table, and be cannon fodder for sides like leeds. sign the man.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{hang on, hang on, careful...}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{i will handle bloody longson.}
