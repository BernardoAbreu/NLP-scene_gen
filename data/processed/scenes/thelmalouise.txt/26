<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{don't you hit me! don't you fucking hit me!}
<A>__{there is no trace of friendliness in his face now. he looks mean and dangerous. he lets go of her face and pins her arms behind her. he holds both of her arms with one hand.}
<C>__{harlan}

<D>__{don't hurt me. harlan. please.}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{he turns her around, pushing her face down onto the back of the car. he holds both her arms in one hand and continues pulling her dress up over her hips. he starts to undo his pants as we hear the crunch of gravel.}

<C>__{louise}
<D>__{you let her go, you fat fucking asshole, or i'm gonna splatter your ugly face all over this nice car.}
<A>__{harlan slowly raises his hands in the air, and thelma darts out, pulling her dress down.}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{now, calm down. we were just havin' a little fun.}
<A>__{louise glances at thelma. thelma shakes her head no.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{looks like you've got a real fucked up idea of fun. now turn around.}
<A>__{louise starts to back away, but the gun is still close to his face. his pants are undone in the front. she is still backing away with the gun raised. thelma is inching away as well.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{just for the future, when a woman's crying like that, she's not having any fun!}
<A>__{louise lowers the gun and stares at him for a second. then she turns and walks away. thelma does, too.}
<C>__{harlan}
<P>__{(pulling up his pants)}
<D>__{bitch. i should have gone ahead and fucked her.}
<A>__{louise stops in her tracks.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{i said suck my cock.}
<A>__{louise takes two long strides back towards him, raises the gun and fires a bullet into his face. we hear his body hit the gravel parking lot. louise's pov. the car behind him is splattered with blood. thelma and louise are both silent. we hear the sound of the nightclub in the distance. louise lowers the gun.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{oh my god.}

<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(quietly, to herself)}
<D>__{you watch your mouth, buddy.}
<A>__{thelma comes careening up in reverse. louise hops in and thelma peels out, spraying gravel. as they speed out of the parking lot back to the road, we hear music blaring from the nightclub. they hit the main road with tires squealing.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{get back to the interstate.}
<A>__{louise lifts her hand and notices she is still holding the gun.}
<C>__{thelma}
