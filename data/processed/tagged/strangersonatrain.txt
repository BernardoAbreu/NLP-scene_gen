<B>__{final draft}
<A>__{october 18, 1950}
<C>__{for educational purposes only}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior union station, washington, d.c. day}
<B>__{long shot the capitol dome in the b.g. and the automobile entrance to the station in the f.g. low camera}
<A>__{activity of cars and taxis arriving and discharging passengers with luggage, busy redcaps, etcetera. we focus on a taxi pulling up and stopping, the driver hands out modest looking luggage, including a bunch of tennis rackets in cases to a redcap. camera pans down as the passenger gets out of the taxi so that we see only his shoes and the lower part of his trousers. he is wearing dark colored brogues and a conservative suit apparently. the feet move toward, the entrance to the station and out of scene. immediately a chauffeur driven limousine drives up and an expensive place of airplane luggage is handed out of this, and the passenger alighting from the back is seen to be wearing black and white sport shoes which, as before, are all we see of him. the sport shoes start off in the wake of the brogues.}
<L>__{interior station lobby}
<A>__{camera follows the sport shoes and the brogues across the lobby into a passenger tunnel. there is the usual activity of passengers walking to and from, a loud speaker announcing trains, etc.}
<L>__{exterior passenger tunnel}
<A>__{as the brogues and the sport shoes emerge to the train platform, camera pans them over to the steps of the train.}
<L>__{interior train}
<A>__{the brogues and the sport shoes pass separately down the aisle, the sport shoes turning in at a compartment door and the brogues continuing toward the parlor car.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior parlor car (process)}
<A>__{the brogues come to rest before a chair as the owner sits down. a moment later the sport shoes come to rest. before in adjoining chair. the legs belonging to the sport shoes stretch out, and one of the shoes touches one of the brogues.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{oh, excuse me!}
<A>__{camera pulls back and up to show two young men seated in two parlor car chairs. brun0 anthony, the wearer of the sport shoes, is about twenty five. he wears his expensive clothes with the tweedy nonchalance of a young man who has always had the best. the wearer of the brogues is a fine looking but, at the moment, a somewhat troubled young man. this is guy haines. he, too, is in his middle twenties and is well dressed because he can now afford to be. he nods politely, acknowledging bruno's apology, then turns away with the gesture implying he wants privacy.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(smiling with sudden recognition)}
<D>__{i beg your pardon, but aren't you guy haines.}
<A>__{guy nods with a polite half smile. being a well known tournament tennis player, he has had this sort of experience before.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(snapping his finger)}
<D>__{sure! i saw you blast faraday right off the court in south orange last season. what a backhand! made the semi finals, didn't you?}
<A>__{guy acknowledges this with a modest nod and turns to his magazine rolled up in is fist.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(with open admiration)}
<D>__{i certainly admire people who do things.}
<P>__{(smiling and introducing himself)}
<D>__{i'm bruno anthony. bruno. see guy looks up. bruno indicates his gold tie pin which bears his name in cut out letters. guy looks at it with the faintest expression of disdain. i suppose you think it's corny. but my mother gave it to me so of course i wear it to please her.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(patiently)(a faint smile)}
<D>__{how do you do.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(with an apologetic grin)}
<D>__{i don't usually talk so much. go ahead and read.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(wryly)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{guy tries to read but is uneasily aware of bruno's open appraisal.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{it must be pretty exciting to be so important.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(fidgeting slightly)}
<D>__{a tennis player isn't so important.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{people who do things are important. i never seem to do anything.}
<A>__{not knowing how to answer this, guy looks a little embarrassed.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(still insistent on being friendly)}
<D>__{i suppose you're going to southampton for the doubles.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{you are a tennis fan.}
<A>__{bruno is inordinately pleased by this small tribute.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{wish i could see you play. but i've got to be back in washington tomorrow. i live in arlington, you know.}
<A>__{he has taken out a cigarette case. holds it out to guy.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{cigarette?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{not now, thanks. i don't smoke much.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{i smoke too much.}
<A>__{he fumbles for a match. guy brings out a lighter and hands it to bruno.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(he stares at the lighter, impressed)}
<D>__{elegant.}
<B>__{close shot of the lighter}
<A>__{showing that it has the insignia of crossed rackets embossed on it, and underneath is engraved the inscription: "to g from a".}
<C>__{bruno's voice}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{to g from a. bet i can guess who a is.}
<B>__{wider shot}
<A>__{guy reacts sharply.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{anne burton. sometimes i turn the sport page and look at the society news. and the pictures. she's very beautiful, senator burton's daughter.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you're quite a reader, mr. anthony.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{yes, i am. ask me anything, from today's stock reports to li'l abner, and i got the answer.}
<C>__{bruno }
<D>__{even news about people i don't know. like who'd like to marry whom when his wife gets her divorce.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{perhaps you read too much.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(contritely)}
<D>__{there i go again. too friendly. i meet someone i' like and open my yap too wide. i'm sorry...}
<A>__{at the appeal on bruno's face, guy slowly relents.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{that's all right. forget it. i guess i'm pretty jumpy.}
<A>__{bruno smiles with and signals a waiter.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{there's a new cure for that.}
<P>__{(to waiter)}
<D>__{scotch and plain water. a pair. double.}
<P>__{(to guy with a chuckle)}
<D>__{only kind of doubles i play.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you'll have to drink both of them.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{and i can do it.}
<P>__{(moving in)}
<D>__{when's the wedding?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{the wedding. you and anne burton.}
<P>__{(a gesture of explanation)}
<D>__{it was in the papers.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{it shouldn't have been. unless they've legalized bigamy overnight.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{i have a theory about that. i'd like to tell you about it some time. but right now i suppose divorce is still the simplest operation.}
<A>__{the waiter has brought the drinks. bruno slips the lighter into hip pocket to free his hands for the bills which he gives to the waiter, waving away the change. he offers a glass to guy. guy takes it.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(as if he needs it)}
<D>__{i guess i will.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(happily)}
<D>__{this is wonderful having your company all the way to new york.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(forced to explain)}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, i'm not going direct. i'm stopping off. at metcalf.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{metcalf? what would anybody want to go there for?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{it's my home town.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{oh, i get it! a little talk with your wife to about the divorce! i suppose she was the girl next door. held her hand in high school and before you knew it hooked!}
<P>__{(proud of his perspicacity)}
<D>__{am i right?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(laconically)}
<D>__{close enough.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(raises his glass)}
<D>__{well, here's luck, guy. drink up then we'll have some lunch sent to my compartment.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{thanks very much. but i think i will go to the dining car.}
<P>__{(he hails a waiter}
<D>__{who is passing through with a food laden}
<P>__{tray)}
<D>__{do you know if there are any vacant seats in the dining car now?}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{not for about twenty minutes i'm afraid, sir.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{see? you'll have to lunch with me.}
<P>__{(motions the waiter back)}
<D>__{say, waiter, bring me some lamb chops and french fries and chocolate ice cream, compartment d, car 121.}
<P>__{(turns to guy)}
<D>__{what'll you have, guy?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{thanks just the same, but i really don't think }
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{oh, go on and order.}
<A>__{the waiter is hovering impatiently. guy gives in out of embarrassment.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{well, i will just have a hamburger and a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(delighted, lifts his}
<D>__{glass in another}
<P>__{toast)}
<D>__{to the next mrs. haines.}
<A>__{guy nods curtly.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior bruno's compartment on train (process)}
<A>__{bruno and guy are finishing lunch. bruno has been drinking and his eyes are bright and feverish. an almost empty liquor bottle is near a couple of detective novels covered with gaudily illustrated dust jackets. bruno has in unlighted cigarette in his mouth. guy's lighter is on the table. bruno snaps it a couple of times, as though fascinated, lights his cigarette and puts the lighter on the table again.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{sure, i went to college. three of them. every time they kicked me out my father threw me back in.}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{he finally gave up. he thinks i'm awfully small fry, not worth the bait.}
<P>__{(wistfully)}
<D>__{you my friend, guy?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{sure. i'm your friend, bruno.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(a little woozy)}
<D>__{no, you're not, nobody thinks i'm anything special. only my mother.}
<P>__{(empties the bottle into his glass)}
<D>__{my father hates me.}
<A>__{guy smiles this off as nonsense.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you must be imagining things.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(hitting the bottom}
<D>__{of the bottle for}
<P>__{the last drop)}
<D>__{and i hate him. he thinks i ought to catch the eight five bus every morning, punch a timeclock and work my way up selling paint or something. him with all his money!}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(amused by bruno)}
<D>__{well, what do you want to do?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{you mean before or after i kill him?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{before, of course.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(leaning forward eagerly)}
<D>__{i want to do everything. i got a theory you're supposed to do everything before you die. have you ever driven a car, blindfolded, at a hundred and fifty miles an hour?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{not lately.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{i did. i flew in a jet plans too.}
<P>__{(his hand traces a}
<D>__{swift streak through the air, and he adds}
<P>__{sound effects)}
<D>__{zzzzzzzp! man, that's a thrill! almost blow the sawdust out of my head. i'm going to make a reservation on the first rocket to the moon...}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(amused and curious)}
<D>__{what are you trying prove?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{i'm not like you, guy. you're lucky. you're smart. marrying the boss's daughter is a nice short cut to a career, isn't it?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{marrying the senator's daughter has nothing to do with it. can't a fellow look past a tennis not without being a goldbricker?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{take it easy, boy. i'm your friend, remember? i'd do anything for you.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(humoring bruno)}
<D>__{sure, bruno, sure.}
<C>__{guy }
<P>__{(glancing at his watch)}
<D>__{we'll be pulling in soon. i've got to change trains.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{what'd you say her name was your wife's?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{miriam.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{that's it. miriam joyce haines. played around a lot, i suppose?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{let's not talk about it any more.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(almost hopefully)}
<D>__{maybe she'll make more trouble for you.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{you mean you got enough on her to get your divorce no matter what?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{let's change subject, bruno, can't we?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{okay, guy. want me to tell you one of my ideas for murdering my father?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(indicating the detective novels)}
<D>__{you've been reading too many of these.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(going right on)}
<D>__{you want to hear about the busted light socket in the bathroom, or the carbon monoxide in the garage?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{no. i may be old fashioned, but i thought murder was against the law.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{but not against the law of nature. my theory is that everybody is a potential murderer. didn't you ever want to kill somebody? say one of those useless fellows miriam was running around with?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you can't go around killing people just because you think they're useless.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{oh, what's a life or two? some people are bitter off dead, guy. take your wife and my father, for instance. it reminds me of a wonderful idea had once. i used to put myself to sleep at night figuring it out. now, let's say you want to get rid of your wife.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{let's say she refuses to give you a divorce }
<P>__{(raises a finger and stops guy's protest)}
<D>__{let's say. you'd be afraid to kill her because you'd get caught. and what would trip you up? motive. now here's the plan...}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i'm afraid i haven't time to listen.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(ignoring the remark)}
<D>__{it's so simple, too. a couple of fellows meet accidentally, like you and me. no connection between them at all. never saw each other before. each of them has somebody he'd like to get rid of, but he can't murder the person he wants to get rid of. he'll get caught. so they swap murders.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{swap murders?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{each fellow does the other fellow's murder. then there is nothing to connect them. the one who had the motive isn't there. each fellow murders a total stranger. like you do my murder and i do yours.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(with relief)}
<D>__{we're coming into my station.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{for example, your wife, my father. criss cross.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{we do talk the same language don't we, guy?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(preparing to leave)}
<D>__{sure, we talk the same language. thanks for the lunch.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(beaming)}
<D>__{i'm glad you enjoyed it. i thought the lamb chops were a little overdone myself.}
<A>__{he holds out his hand. guy is in a hurry but he shakes hands.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{nice meeting you, bruno.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(detaining him at the door)}
<D>__{you think my theory is okay, guy? you like it?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{sure, sure, bruno. they're all okay.}
<P>__{(he salutes a quick}
<D>__{goodbye and hurries}
<P>__{away)}
<A>__{left alone, bruno picks up guy's lighter from the table, starts to call guy back to hand it to him.then he looks closer at the insignia of crossed tennis rackets.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{criss cross.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{a wide view of the town of metcalf metcalf railroad station}
<A>__{as the train comes in.}
<B>__{the train station platform med. shot}
<A>__{as guy gets off the with his suitcase and tennis rackets. a baggage man with baggage truck is passing.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{hi, bill.}
<C>__{baggage man}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{guy haines! good to too you, boy. you be sure to win at southampton tomorrow, hear me? i've got two dollars on your nose.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(indicating his suitcase and rackets)}
<D>__{then park these in a lucky spot for a few hours, will you?}
<C>__{baggage man}
<D>__{sure thing.}
<A>__{he loads them onto a truck.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior metcalf street long shot}
<A>__{guy is walking up the main street.}
<L>__{exterior music shop}
<A>__{typical music shop of a small town, with plate glass windows and displays of radios, records, sheet music, etc. activity of a couple of customers and salespeople inside. guy comes along the street and goes into the shop.}
<L>__{interior music shop}
<A>__{as guy enters. there are the usual counters and shelves, pianos and radios on display, and the sound of a piano being tuned in the back of the store. miriam is finishing with a customer at a counter. mr. hargreaves, the manager, is busy at the shelves. another girl clerk is serving a customer. in one of the glass cubicles where records are tried out, a customer is playing symphonic music; in a second glass cubicle another customer is listening to a record of popular music. a third cubicle is empty. activity of the street is seen through the plate glass front. guy walks straight to miriam, just as she is finishing with her woman customer, handing over a small package.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(taking money from customer)}
<D>__{even change. thank you, madam.}
<P>__{(she looks up at guy}
<D>__{as the woman moves}
<P>__{off)}
<D>__{well hello, guy.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you're looking well, miriam.}
<A>__{miriam's face is pretty because it is still young. she is self centered and inclined to be vindictive. she wears harlequin glasses with myopic lenses which tend to make her eyes look small.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{so are you. you've got a nice tan, playing tennis with all your rich friends.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(ignoring the remark)}
<D>__{what time do we meet your lawyer?}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(sly little smile)}
<D>__{what's your hurry?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{my hurry? that's funny, coming from you! you're the one who's in a hurry, aren't you?}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(coyly)}
<D>__{when you wouldn't give me the divorce right away, i sort of hoped it was because you were a little bit jealous.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(biting)}
<D>__{i got over being jealous, a long time ago miriam.}
<A>__{miriam's eyes slide toward the other girl clerk who has moved closer, within listening range.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(indicating empty glass cubicle)}
<D>__{let's talk in there.}
<A>__{guy follows miriam across to the empty room. miriam has brought her purse along. they enter.}
<L>__{interior cubicle}
<A>__{once inside, the sounds of the music playing from other parts of the shop are heard but very faintly. the piano tuning still goes on, but less stridently. miriam and guy are cooped together in the close quarters.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(intimately)}
<D>__{now this is cosier. sort of like old times, isn't it, guy?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{oh, skip it, miriam. it's pretty late to start flirting with a discarded husband. especially when you're going to have another man's baby.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{do you know, i think you're handsomer than ever?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{let's see your lawyer and get this over with.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{did you bring the money, guy? lawyers are expensive.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(taking money from his wallet)}
<D>__{here it is.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(taking the money greedily)}
<D>__{if i'd known what all that tennis nonsense of yours was going to lead to, i wouldn't have run out on you.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what are you trying to say, miriam? come out with it.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(tucking the bills away)}
<D>__{i'm not getting a divorce.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(tense and angry)}
<D>__{why, you little doublecrosser. i didn't want this divorce, you did. that's what you've been harping about for the past year.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{it's a woman's privilege to change her mind... now i can shop for some pretty clothes. i wouldn't want you to be ashamed of me in washington when we go to all those dinners and swanky parties.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{and what do you mean by that?}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(coyly)}
<D>__{don't look so mad, guy. you always smile when your picture is being taken for the papers.}
<C>__{miriam }
<D>__{especially when you have anne burton hanging on your arm.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{let's not talk about anne burton.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{so, it's really serious between you two? well, you can throw your dreams about her into the ashcan. guy, i'm coming to washington.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{to have my baby and be with you.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{why me? it's not my baby.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{but people don't know that, guy, do they? it would make a pretty story, wouldn't it the senator's daughter involved with a married man who's about to become a father.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(furiously)}
<D>__{you black conniving little liar!}
<A>__{a few people in the shop look around as guy's voice rises above the sound of the record playing.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{keep your voice down.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what happened? did he run out on you?}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{no man runs out on me. not even you.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you're a liar and a cheat, miriam. you've wanted to get rid of me long enough and now i will go you one better i never want to see or hear of you again.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(demurely)}
<D>__{i could be very pathetic as the deserted little mother in a courtroom, guy. think it over. who would believe you?}
<A>__{guy seizes her angrily and in so doing, knocks the tone arm across the record with a loud screech. from outside we can see heads turn. mr. hargreaves, the manager, is very disturbed. med. shot through glass partition from hargreaves' viewpoint we see guy gripping miriam's arms and apparently addressing her in a threatening manner, although we do not hear his words. the smile has faded from miriam's face and something like cringing fear has taken its place. she is drawn and tense and seems to cower beneath guy's rage. mr. hargreaves moves forward and opens guy's tirade.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{...that's what should happen to people like you. and if i...}
<C>__{hargreaves}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{break it up, folks. this isn't the place for a family quarrel.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(his eyes blazing)}
<D>__{sorry. i'm leaving.}
<A>__{he starts to exit from the booth. miriam grabs his arm and screams at him:}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(yelling like a fishwife)}
<D>__{you heard what i said, guy haines. you can't throw me away like an old shoe. i'm coming to washington to have my baby. tell that to the senate!}
<A>__{guy strides out of the store, the manager and a few customers turning around in surprise. the two customers in other booths, seeing the quarrel, open their doors simultaneously and miriam's tirade is climaxed by a cacophony of noise, a big symphony, loud hot music, and the apparently unaware piano tuner.}
<L>__{exterior main street metcalf shooting towards station}
<A>__{guy is striding along angrily. he comes to the same intersection and the same cop. the officer makes a friendly gesture, is if he'd like to talk awhile, but guy strides past him without noticing.}
<L>__{exterior metcalf station (process)}
<A>__{guy comes into the scene, crosses to a row of public telephone booths, enters one. inside the telephone booth, he dumps some loose change on the shelf, sticks a nickel in the telephone, speaks into it.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{long distance.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{i want washington, d. c. the number is republic 0800. person to person. miss anne burton.}
<A>__{another pause, very long. guy is very restless. he digs a cigarette out of his pocket and sticks it in his mouth, then looks through his pockets for his lighter, doesn't find it. he looks puzzled, but about that time the operator speaks to him.}
<C>__{guy}
