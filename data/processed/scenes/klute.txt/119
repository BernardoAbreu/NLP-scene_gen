<L>__{interior klute's apartment: bree, klute day (dawn)}
<A>__{klute half sits up in bed. bree is fast asleep with her head pillowed on his midsection. some humor in this shot: he wants to move but doesn't want to wake her. at a point he risks it, reaches out for something beside the bed. her eyes open immediately. he puts his hand on her face, trying gently to press her back.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{go back to sleep.}
<A>__{but she takes his hand and retains it rolls onto her back. still relaxed, but a little more separate, thoughtful a mixture of the bree we've seen before and the bree we've glimpsed, the possible bree. she observes:}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{i'm still scared.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i mean different but still.}
<P>__{(frowns)}
<D>__{look, i made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so i only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{my bed.}
<A>__{she grins, then starts to reach for him, still receptive then feels another (and genuine) pang, turns her head away sharply.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{he looks at her with concern, but only caresses her. she manages to explain }
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{i am scared. the things i do. the things i could do to you.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{mm.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{no, not just 'mm'. you don't know what i }
<A>__{he settles himself beside her, makes overtures. she responds, but:}
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{yup.}
<A>__{she pretends to bite they tussle she feels a suddenly growing excitement, seizes him. fiercely, welcomingly, full out.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{oh }
<A>__{and we cut directly to:}
