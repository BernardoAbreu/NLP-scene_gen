<L>__{exterior raft night}
<A>__{the moon is full. the waves cast off shadows on the ocean. chuck is staring into the sky, trying to find a star to navigate by.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{polaris, where are you? maybe i'm too far south.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{you don't know where you are. you missed the shipping lanes.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{moon's too bright.}
<A>__{we hear the fraying sound again.}
<L>__{exterior raft day}
<A>__{chuck saws at the outer log with his stone knife. across the water comes a storm. we can see it like a waterfall moving toward us.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{you're putting off the inevitable.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{i'm putting it off.}
<A>__{he looks at the deteriorating rope, at the rotting sail.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{that's what's happening to you.}
<A>__{chuck pushes the outer log away, then takes the loose rope and begins to lash it around the center logs.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{you're rotting away.}
<A>__{the raft is rocking. the waves are stronger. it's hard to tie the logs together. rain falls like a sheet on chuck.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{get water!}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{fix raft first.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{water water water }
<A>__{chuck works frantically in the rain, trying to tie the rope. finally he does. then he scrambles for his water collecting funnel, struggles to pull it up. one corner is stuck and collapses. desperately he rights it, pulls the funnel up. drops begin to run down the sides and collect in the jar. soaked, chuck stares at the water as it rises. then the rain stops. we see the line of rain recede away from chuck, spattering the ocean. but all around him the ocean is calm again. and out comes the sun.}
