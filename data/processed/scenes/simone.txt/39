<A>__{viktor sits at the head of the table, surrounded by hal, lotus, mac and three other cast members. a preliminary poster behind him "coming this summer simone in eternity forever" bears a huge photograph of simone's face.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i can't tell you how delighted i am to have this wonderful cast assembled for "eternity forever". thank you all. now, a reminder as a condition for working on this film, you will not be rehearsing with simone, shooting with simone and you are forbidden from contacting simone in any way at any time, whatsoever.}
