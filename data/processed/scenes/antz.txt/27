<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior weed clump day}
<A>__{z and bala dust themselves off.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{what was that thing?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{how should i know?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{i order you to find out where we are!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{alright, alright, i will try to get directions from one of the locals.}
<A>__{z tries to flag down some passing bees.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{excuse me, i }
<P>__{(it passes him by; he tries the next)}
<D>__{pardon me }
<P>__{(same response)}
<D>__{and they call them social insects.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{climb up that tree and get a better view!}
<A>__{bala points to a thin blade of grass. gingerly, z tests the grass and starts climbing up it...but his weight bends it, so that he's lowered back to the ground, face to upside down face with bala.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{i've been kidnapped by the village idiot.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{who's the bigger idiot the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{how dare you speak to me like that? i'm the princess!}
<A>__{z squares up with her.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{theoretically, yes. but is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{of course! it defines society! to deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{but can there be a society composed of just two ants?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{no! there's no such thing as "just two ants." you never see just two ants you see a million ants!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{look around, sweetheart.}
<A>__{she looks around. she doesn't like what she sees. she glowers at z.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{i hate you.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{well i guess that makes us even.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{ha! don't make me laugh. you're crazy about me! that's why you lied and cheated to get near me!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{oh come on, you're the one who came after me the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(repulsed)}
<D>__{i was slumming it! i danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{is that the same standard you used to choose general formica?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{i didn't choose him. what kind ofidiot would...}
<P>__{(unconvincingly)}
<D>__{...choose who she wanted to marry?}
<A>__{she shakes herself out of it.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...}
<P>__{(he decides)}
<D>__{you go back. me, i'm going to insectopia. balainsectopia? you stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{yeah, well i have it on a reliable source...}
<P>__{(he knows that was maybe stretching it)}
<D>__{that it exists. now you follow the yellow egg...}
<P>__{(looking around)that direction.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{worker! come back here now!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{i've got a name. it's z.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{that's not a name! that's just a letter!}
<A>__{z, meanwhile, hits the road. bala has no idea of where to go. just then, the scariness of the outside world comes through to her. we start hearing noises the equivalent of scary jungle sounds in a tarzan movie the hissing, croaking, chirruping... bala sees eyes looking out at her from all directions...and spots a colossal monster (a sparrow) fixing her with his beady gaze.}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(clears her throat)}
<D>__{worker?}
<P>__{(no response...louder now)}
<D>__{oh worker? where are you?}
<P>__{(getting desperate)}
<D>__{z? z? wait for me!!!}
<A>__{bala heads off after z.}
