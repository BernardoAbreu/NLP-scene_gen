<L>__{interior hospital room day}

<D>__{aprazolam? that's generic xanax and this hydrocodone is generic vicodin. it's shit, prolly canadian.}
<A>__{harling casually tosses the pills down his gullet and expertly swallows them without water. he grabs whip's medical chart and scours it as he prattles on...}
