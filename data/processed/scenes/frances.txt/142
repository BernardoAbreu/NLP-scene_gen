<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior steilacoom the hydro therapy room day}
<A>__{a nurse ushers frances and two attendants into a sparse tiled room with dilapidated plumbing and fungus growing between the tiles. in the center are three steel baths with hammocks suspended above them. the attendants strap frances into a bath as dr. doyle enters.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(speaking with difficulty)}
<D>__{doctor, it may sound odd, but i believe i've profited from my stay here. it's just what i've needed, to get away like this. but i'm recuperated now. i've had lots of time to think and i've made a few decisions about my life. i'm ready to get on with it.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{i know you believe that.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{...don't you?}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{i'm afraid not. you see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. your problem cuts very deep, frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. does that make sense?}
<A>__{the attendants lower her into the empty tub.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{no. cut this runaround, doctor. i know better.}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{listen to yourself, frances. the resistance, the anger in your voice.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(tightly)}
<D>__{you... i'm sorry, forgive me. doctor, tell me honestly, what do i have to do to get out of here?}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{be patient, that's all. take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. you'll be yourself again, i assure you.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{...i see.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{we'll talk more about this. i will see you later.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{one question. if i'm not myself now, just who do you think i am?}
<A>__{the doctor smiles sympathetically.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{we'll talk.}
<A>__{as he turns to leave, frances laughs triumphantly. the two attendants lower her into the bath and begin to fill it with ice cold water.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{what the hell!}
<A>__{they shove a rubber bit between her teeth. she immediately spits it out and defiantly starts to sing in order to keep her teeth from chattering.}
