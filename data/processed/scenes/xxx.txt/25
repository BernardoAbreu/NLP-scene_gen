<L>__{exterior street level night}
<A>__{the bicycle comes flying down and smashes into the pavement. it bounces a full two stories back up before coming to rest. xander glides down and makes his landing. accomplices #4 and #5 rush out to help him gather up his chute and jump in the van. sirens approach as the van makes it's escape. as cop cars screech up to the skyscraper, one of them runs over the smoking wreckage of the bike.}
