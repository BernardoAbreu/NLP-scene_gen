<L>__{exterior hillside day}
<A>__{from afar, an fbi agent views the little going on.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{ain't that just like women.}
<A>__{but as the agent is saying this, viewing them from the ridge, a large rock tumbles down the hill and grazes his head, knocking him out. view of the side of the ridge from where the rock came, but there is strangely nothing where we expect to see the chink. below: the cowgirls.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{so be it. it looks serious this time, though. all these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but i'm not in this for whooping cranes. i'm in it for cowgirls. if we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. i want a finer fate than that for me and for every other cowgirl. better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{how did this business get started, anyhow? why are the birds nesting here?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you were aware that we were feeding them, weren't you? we fed them brown rice and they stayed over a couple of extra days. then we decided to try something different. we mixed our brown rice with fishmeal whoopers love seafood, and fishmeal is cheap. then delores suggested another ingredient, and we think that's what did the trick.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{you mean...}
<C>__{debbie and jelly together}
<D>__{peyote!}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{they're drugged.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{aw, come off it, sissy. what do you mean, 'drugged'? every living thing is a chemical composition and anything that is added to it changes that composition. when you eat a cheeseburger or a three musketeers bar, it changes your body chemistry. the kind of food you eat, the kind of air you breathe, can change your mental state. does that mean you're 'drugged'?}
<A>__{sissy frames the flock with the hole in the center of her cheese sandwich.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{no, i guess not.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{'drugged' is a stupid word.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{but the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. it's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{the way i see it, is that the peyote mellowed them out. made them less uptight. they were afraid of bad weather and humans. that's why they migrated and kept to themselves. but the peyote has enlightened them. it's taught them there is nothing to fear but fear itself. now they're digging life and letting the bad vibes slide on. don't worry, be happy. be here now.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{fear in wild animals is completely different from paranoia in people. in the wilderness ecosystem, fear is natural and necessary. it's merely a mechanism for maintaining life. if the cranes hadn't had a capacity for fear, they would have disappeared long ago and you'd be having to get loaded with common old everyday meadowlarks and mallards.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{this here discussion is destined to become academic. because we've got less than half a bag of peyote buttons left and delores's run ended up in the mottburg jail. so any day now we'll get a chance to see how the whoopers behave when they come down, to see if the peyote experience really changed them or not. but in the meantime, i want to say this about fear.....}
<A>__{then sissy and jelly hear a news broadcast on the radio.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{judge greenfield, at the request of the aclu, has granted a forty eight hour extension of the deadline by which the rubber rose cowgirls must comply with his order. negotiations between the cowgirls and the government are expected to follow. another item in, the forewoman of the rubber rose ranch, a delores del ruby is now free on bond after having been arrested in mottburg with more than fifty pounds of peyote buttons. her bail has been paid by the owner of the besieged ranch, countess products, inc. miss del ruby's bail having come from the tycoon's personal advisor, a certain dr. robbins of new york city.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{dr. robbins?}
