<L>__{interior coma bar a moment later night}
<A>__{stu bursts in, flattens himself against the wall as the roadkill skitter past outside. he's given them the slip. he looks around. the bar's a weird melange of styles. coma victims ride around in wheelchairs refurbished as bumper cars, drinking cocktails from iv bottler. a four armed elephant god is at the mighty wurlitzer while a mermaid vocalist in a half shell belts out the wistful lyrics of johnny mercer's "dream." and over at the bar...}
<C>__{bull }
<D>__{new in town, huh? what're you drinking?}
<A>__{out of breath, stu edges toward the bar as the bartender, bull, turns away to grab a fresh glass.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{chasing me animals horrible }
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{animals? what kind of animals?}
<A>__{stu gags. bull is a full fledged minotaur, body of a man, head of a bull. his features are cubist weirdly squashed over to one side.}
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{yeah, i know picasso. guernica, right? that's what everybody says although personally, i don't see the resemblance. what are you drinking?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{uhh martini?}

<D>__{olive. where exactly am i?}
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{dark town. land of nightmares. i'm bull.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{stu miley.}
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{yeah, i've seen a few of your dreams. you're quite a celebrity down here.}
<A>__{stu gives him a cockeyed look. bull points to a monitor mounted over the bar, on which a panicked man in pajamas is trying to run barefoot through a great sticky sea of molasses.}
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{i told you, it's the land of nightmares. same on every channel...all the stuff people dream, after they have the extra anchovies.}
<A>__{he changes channels with a remote. now we see a guy falling through midair, arms and legs flailing, falling, falling, falling...}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{jeez, it all looks like bad late night cable.}
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{sad commentary, huh?}
<A>__{now a small muffled voice speaks from the area of stu's backpack:}
<C>__{disembodied voice }
<D>__{"bull," huh? that's cute. what's your last name "shit"??}
<C>__{bull}
<P>__{(turning angrily to stu)}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i didn't say anything.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{nice face. lemme guess. you were in a bullfight ...with a mack truck!!}
<A>__{stu claps both hands over his mouth to prove he's not the one talking. bull glowers at him, snorting steam out of both nostrils.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i was, uh, just getting ready to leave...}
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{yo, jumbo. we got us some kind of ventriloquist here.}
<A>__{the elephant god from the wurlitzer organ comes lumbering over.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{well, hello, sailor. get a lot of dates with that ding dong on your face??}
<A>__{bull and jumbo rear back to punch stu's lights out. he's saying his prayers when his backpack begins to bulge and quiver and a small furry beast pops out, cackling his head off!!}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{just kiddin', folks! drinks for everybody }
<P>__{(pointing at stu)}
<D>__{on him!! hiya, boss!!}
<A>__{bull and jumbo back off, stunned. the monkey grabs stu's face and plants a big wet smooch right on his nose. stu screams.}
