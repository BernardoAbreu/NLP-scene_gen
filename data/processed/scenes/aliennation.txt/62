<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior "x" bar night}
<A>__{a violet neon "x" fills frame, flashing hypnotically. it's a bar catering to rough trade newcomer clientele. several alien men, brute laborer types, lounge around out front. they glare with antagonism as sykes and jetson climb out of their car.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(to jetson)}
<D>__{okay, just stay back and do what i do. watch and learn, watch and learn...}
<L>__{interior "x" bar night}
<A>__{sykes and jetson walk into the almost total blackness of this all newcomer place. a few near infrared indigo lamps dot the blackness.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{i can't see dick in here.}
<A>__{we can dimly make out booths along one wall, some tables, and the bar. there are maybe twenty figures seated or standing in the darkness. the room falls silent in a wave as sykes' presence becomes noticed. sykes saunters forward, commanding the space with his unhurried movements.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(calling into the dark silence)}
<D>__{which one'a you slags is porter?}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(from the back of the bar)}
<D>__{who wants to know?}
<A>__{sykes squints into the darkness, then }
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(aside to jetson)}
<D>__{who said that?}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(tilts his head to indicate)}
<D>__{at the end of the bar.}
<A>__{sykes nods, starts in that direction.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{my name is sykes. i'm }
<C>__{alien voice}
<D>__{ss'ai k'ss?}
<A>__{the whole place roars with laughter. too late sykes remembers what his name sounds like to them. he continues down the bar and a figure in one of the booths sticks his leg out and trips sykes with his size 16 work boot. sykes stumbles, then recovers and pivots on the offender. hoots and derisive laughter. he sees only shadows.}
<C>__{offender}
<P>__{(merely a voice in the dark)}
<D>__{careful, ss'loka', you might hurt yourself.}
<A>__{more laughter. sykes gives the darkness where the offender sits a hard stare, then turns and shoulders his way to the end of the bar. jetson follows. sykes stops behind a big newcomer in greasy work clothes.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{the punk newcomer in the next seat is keeping his head down, trying to be inconspicuous. he glances over at the two cops... his expression shifting to recognition as he spots jetson.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{sykes speaks to the big newcomer's back.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{you porter?}
<A>__{the big newcomer continues to sip his mug of sour milk. doesn't turn. sykes grabs him by the shoulder and turns him around. the alien grabs sykes' hand off, rising to his full height. he and sykes lock eyes. meanwhile. the punk newcomer (porter) has started to slip away unnoticed. jetson spots him, reaches out with one arm, and grabs him by the jacket.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{no, matthew. i believe this is the one you want.}
<A>__{he pulls porter back into play. now jetson sees porter's face... and he, too, reacts with recognition. sykes gives jetson a sour look, releases the big newcomer, and turns his malice on the punk newcomer.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{your name wouldn't happen to be porter, would it?}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{uh, matthew...}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(over his shoulder to jetson)}
<D>__{back off, george.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{but i (know this man).}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{i will handle it.}
<A>__{jetson backs off, letting him handle it.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(to porter)}
<D>__{jesus, are the questions too tough for you already? let's try again }
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{is your name porter?}
<C>__{porter}
<D>__{ss'kya'ta'.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(to jetson)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{screw you.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(back to porter)}
<D>__{screw me? that can't be right.}
<C>__{porter}
<D>__{ss'kya ta' ss'loka'. ss'trokya' ss'lato na'!}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(to sykes, low)}
<D>__{you don't want to know.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{tell me.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{your mother mates out of season.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(to porter)}
<D>__{that's very colorful. but see now i've got a problem. i don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, porter. so i guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?}
<A>__{and instantly sykes whips out this flashlight, snaps on the beam, and arcs it into the faces of the aliens around him. jetson gets a blast of it, too. the aliens are momentarily blinded. sykes has porter pinned to the bar, the flashlight in his face, as he starts to handcuff him. but porter gets a hand free and crushes the head of the flashlight. darkness falls... along with sykes' expression of satisfaction. porter hurls sykes back, slamming him into a table. the crowd hoots and cheers. sykes finds his way to his feet.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{matthew, you don't have to (do this).}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{stay back! i'm okay.}
<A>__{he charges porter, brandishing the flashlight like a club. the two of them battle, then sykes sees his opportunity and brings his knee up viciously into the alien's groin. porter doubles over in feigned agony, then slowly rises again smiling.}
<C>__{porter}
<D>__{don't they teach you anything about us in cop school, little ss'loka'?}
<A>__{porter grabs sykes by the shirt front, is about to deliver a crushing blow, when another arm cuts into frame, locking with porter's, blocking the punch. it is jetson.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{enough.}
<C>__{porter}
<P>__{(eyeing jetson)}
<D>__{ss'tangya t'ssorentsa'. you're a cop.}
<P>__{(with some contempt)}
<D>__{it fits you.}
<A>__{jetson says something to him in the alien language. porter gives him a hard stare, then moves toward the back exit. sykes stumbles over to jetson.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{you know that guy?}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{from quarantine, when my people first arrived here. he and i were housed together.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{how could a straight arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{in the camps, we were lodged four to a room. the selection process was entirely random. we did not get to stay with our friends... or families...}
<A>__{and he moves toward the back exit. sykes watches him go.}
