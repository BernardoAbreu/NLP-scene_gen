<A>__{the last light out, stella stops to catch her breath, and turns to jeff.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{when you took your first snapshot did you ever think it would bring you to this?}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(urgently)}
<D>__{stella how long do you think he'll stay there?}
<C>__{stella}
<P>__{(squinting out window)}
<D>__{unless he's dumber than i think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.}
<A>__{jeff points to a drawer in the wall cabinets.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{my billfold! in the right hand drawer.}
<A>__{stella moves to get it.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{what do you need money for?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{to bail lisa out of jail.}
<A>__{she finds a billfold, hands it to jeff. he takes it, extracts some bills and begins counting them. as he counts, stella comments:}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{you know you could just leave her there until after next tuesday so you could sneak away safely as planned.}
<A>__{he looks up sharply at her, and then without comment goes back to counting the money.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(with obvious disappointment)}
<D>__{one hundred and twenty seven.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{how much do you think you'll need?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{first offense burglary }
<P>__{(he shrugs)}
<D>__{ probably two fifty.}
<P>__{(gets an idea, points)}
<D>__{the piggy bank.}
<A>__{stella, following his pointing finger, gets a piggy bank down from a shelf on the sideboard. he takes it, cracks it on the knee of his cast. it splits open, and some money comes out. mostly bills, a few silver halves. what he doesn't get, stella picks up.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{ten here.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{thirty three here. totals one ninety. not enough.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{i got twenty or so in my purse. give me what you've got.}
<A>__{jeff does, as stella gets her purse.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{what about the rest?}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{when those cops get a look at miss fremont they'll even contribute.}
<A>__{stella goes up to the door. the phone rings. jeff grabs it, picks it up. stella pauses.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(to phone)}
<D>__{just a minute.}
<P>__{(to stella)}
<D>__{i will tell you who it is when you get back.}
<A>__{stella goes quickly out the door. he returns to the phone call, glancing at the same time toward the courtyard.}
