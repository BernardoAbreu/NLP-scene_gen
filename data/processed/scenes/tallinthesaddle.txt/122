<D>__{just a minute }
<P>__{(glances at arly)}
<D>__{what all has she been tellin' you?}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{oh oh, really i'd rather not }
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{go ahead, tell him }
<P>__{(looks at rocklin and goes on defiantly)}
<D>__{ and i dare him to deny it.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{deny what?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{that she was with you last night at the cabin in the mountains.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{well why should i deny it?...}
<C>__{arly}

<D>__{make love to you }
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(forcing her point)}
<D>__{you didn't kiss me i suppose?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{did you expect me to deny that, too?}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(smiles at clara)}
<D>__{you see?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(to clara)}
<D>__{now, maybe you ought to hear what i've got to say }
<A>__{clara is terribly hurt, but struggles to be grown up about it.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{please you needn't explain. after all, it really isn't any of my business, is it?}

<D>__{don't think too harshly of me, will you i }
<A>__{clara can say no more without breaking. so she turns away quickly and hurries out the door. rocklin does a slow burn as he glares at arly.}

<A>__{rocklin makes no reply.}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{pity you didn't fall in love with her, instead of me.}
<A>__{arly is being ridiculous now. he ignores her remarks and concentrates his attention on one of his hands he may have sprained it slightly in the fight.}
