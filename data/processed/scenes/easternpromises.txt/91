<L>__{interior trans siberian restaurant. kitchen day}
<D>__{kirill is preparing food for the night's festivities. semyon enters and goes straight to the sink. he pulls off the plaster from his arm where the blood was taken and pours some vodka over the tiny puncture hole.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{what did they want with you, papa?}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{to poison me. semyon pours more vodka on the wound then takes a swig.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{they took blood from me with a needle. probably the same needle they use for all the junkies and whores and blacks and queers. he glares at kirill as he rolls his sleeve down.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{now i probably have the fucking queer disease. kirill has his back turned, doesn't react. semyon sits heavily. finally...}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{why would they want your blood, papa? for the first time semyon looks vulnerable and confused as he admits....}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{i don't know. kirill is surprised to see his father unsure. he peers at him.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{someone is ahead of me. i don't like people ahead of me. kirill is now unnerved by semyon's quiet confusion. he watches as semyon grabs at the bottle of vodka to drink. he speaks softly as he swigs.}
<C>__{semyon }
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{what the hell did that cocksucker want with my blood? kirill is reluctant to speak at first but eventually chances his arm.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{maybe it's about the baby.}
<C>__{semyon}
<P>__{(swigging)}
<D>__{what baby? a pause.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{some bitch was out there saying you were the father of a baby. semyon turns to kirill, his face hardening...}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{what are you talking about? semyon approaches and kirill gets scared.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{it was nothing. just some bitch...}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{the woman from the hospital. the midwife. semyon stares into kirill's eyes and kirill mistakes his frantic thought process for anger. kirill backs away. semyon is beginning to catch up.}
