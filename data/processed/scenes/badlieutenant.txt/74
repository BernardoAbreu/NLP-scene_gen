<B>__{time passes.}
<A>__{various angles. high noon. the nun is still lying cross. suddenly lt appears in the doorway, a black silhouette against the white light of noon. for a moment, he watches her from a distance. the nun knows he is there. after a time, she gets up, goes to the altar, kneels. as if waiting for him. lt staggers down the center aisle. he's carrying the cigar}
<B>__{box.}
<A>__{lt joins the nun, kneeling next to her at the altar. angle the chalice is still missing. they are all alone. at the altar, before the crucifix, lt confronts the nun face to face. the nun holds her rosary}

<A>__{lt averts his eyes. when he looks up again jesus is back on the cross. inert, and yet lt rises, moves around the interior of the church. he stumbles, struggles, pleads. falls, rises, falls and rises again as if wrestling with an invisible assailant. he collapses in a corner.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{oh god, my god. it's goddamn good to be good. forgive me. father, for i have sinned. it's still goddamn good to be good.}

<C>__{lt}
<D>__{the chalice. tell me! who gave it to you! tell me where the fuck you got it! take me there! now!}
<A>__{at first, she doesn't speak at all. lt begins to cry. begs her to tell him. then he wields his pistol, repeats his plea. then breaks into tears. she speaks at last.}
<C>__{elderly black woman}
<D>__{i can't tell you.}
<A>__{gun in hand, lt gets down on his knees.}

<C>__{lt}
<D>__{a holy thing.}
<P>__{(beat snaps to)}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{suddenly purposive, lt grabs the elderly black woman by the arm. starts pulling her out of the church. he holds the chalice with the other arm, picks up the cigar box on his way out. manages to carry both items. when lt and the elderly black woman reach the door to outside, they both pause to genuflect. then lt grabs her again and they rush out.}
