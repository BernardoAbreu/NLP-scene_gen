<A>__{a power line is down. it hisses and hums a humming very much like the humming mikey has been hearing earlier. the humming takes on the same transcendent tonality to which mikey has become so accustomed at such moments. mikey sits down on a metal street guardrail, to ponder the sound and the snaking coil of electricity. a strange look of almost religious wonder overcomes his face, as the power line connects to the guardrail.}
