<L>__{exterior farmhouse night}
<A>__{the house stands silent in the darkness. lightning crashes, a heavy rain falls. burning jack o' lanterns beam from every window. smoke rises from the chimney. it is halloween night.}
<L>__{interior farmhouse night}
<A>__{close up tv dr. wolfenstein is on screen smashing pumpkins with a giant hammer.}
<C>__{dr. wolfenstein}
<D>__{it is midnight my little boils and ghouls, the witching hour. time for all monsters, murderers, maniacs and madmen to go to work... so lock your doors and bolt your windows, sit back and prepare for a fright night classic...}
<P>__{(lightning crashes)}
<D>__{...the house of frankenstein.}
<A>__{the movie begins and we move off the tv to see: hundreds of candles are lit, illuminating everything with a flickering light. music blares from a cheap stereo. black and orange paper streamers are draped from ceiling to floor. dead center is a large object standing seven feet tall, it is completely covered in paper halloween decorations. a long chain connects the object up into the rafters. this is the halloween party from hell. an intoxicated grampa, dressed as flash gordon, sits in his wheelchair watching the tv, drinking moonshine from an unmarked bottle.}
<C>__{grampa}
<P>__{(slurred drunken yelling at the screen)}
<D>__{get those motherfucker... those high water bitches and rocketship daisies... kill 'em, kill 'em.}
<A>__{crash! crash! crash! tiny stands in a corner tunelessly banging on a large oil drum. he is dressed like a low budget batman, in grey long johns and a black bat mask and cape. a drunk rufus, wearing a bloody police uniform, stands on a table shouting along to the music through a police megaphone. mother and baby, both dressed as superheroes, dance around the covered object. both are swigging moonshine from jugs.}
<C>__{rufus jr.}
<P>__{(shouting through megaphone)}
<D>__{show me, show me, show me, show me!}
<A>__{mother and baby start tearing away the paper covering from the object in the middle of the room. they rip at the paper, spinning and dancing around in a wild pagan ritual. as the shreds of colored paper fall to the floor we see: denise, jerry and mary tied back to back hanging from the chain, each are dressed in a different animal costume. denise is a pig, jerry is a donkey and mary is a rabbit. they are gagged. mother and baby laugh at their helpless victims, splashing moonshine in their faces.}
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{drink up, it's party time.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{enjoy your last night...}
<P>__{(looking around)}

<C>__{mother}
<D>__{quiet, quiet, you know he won't come down with all this hoop dee doo bouncing off the walls. now, calm down.}
<C>__{grampa}
<D>__{i shot an elephant in my pajamas this morning... how he got in my pajamas i will never know.}
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{grampa, shhhhhhhh.}
<C>__{grampa}
<D>__{then we tried to remove the tusks, but they were embedded in so firmly that we couldn't budge 'em.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(gesturing at grampa)}
<D>__{let him finish.}
<C>__{grampa}
<D>__{of course, in alabama the tuscaloosa, but that's entirely irrelephant.}
<A>__{the room goes silent. all eyes are focused on the stairs. a robed figure, otis, appears at the top of the stairs, he begins to descend. rufus waits at the bottom of the stairs. as otis reaches the last step rufus hands him the megaphone. denise, mary and jerry struggle to watch as they in turn rotate past the scene unfolding.}
<C>__{otis}
<P>__{(through the megaphone)}
<D>__{i'm the one who brings the christmas candy... now tell me}
<P>__{(pauses and raises his arms)}

<C>__{mother}
<D>__{who's your daddy!}
<A>__{otis stops the spinning of his prisoners and stands directly before denise. he drops his robe, underneath he is wearing a suit of skin sewn together from pieces of denise's father. denise stares in horror, tears stream down her cheeks, barely able to comprehend the madness around her. otis moves in close and licks her across the face.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{i'm the one who loves you when you're fucking dead!}
<A>__{everyone chants "who's your daddy?"}
<C>__{otis}
<P>__{(imitating willis)}

<P>__{(rotates the chain to mary)}
<D>__{maybe prancing around where you don't belong ain't such a winner of an idea...}

<A>__{slowly turns the chain to face jerry.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{and you, the great rusher of fools, what were you after...}
<P>__{(slaps jerry)}
<D>__{huh, speak to me...}
<P>__{(slaps him again)}
<D>__{oh, that's right, dr. satan... everybody got to know about dr. satan, jesus christ, let the old dog rest for fuck sake, he's already got one foot in the grave and the other's tap dancing around the edge...}

<D>__{zarkoff, i will conquer the sea, the air, the earth... the universe.}
<A>__{mother moves in close to jerry.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{look at the way he lights up... grampa just loves meeting his fans.}
<A>__{otis grabs jerry's cheeks and makes his face move like a ventriloquist dummy, provides jerry's voice.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{aw gee whiz, i'm so excited... i really think you're the coolest... you're tops on the playground, cooler than the fonzie.}

<D>__{i was wondering mr. satan sir, do you like to kiss on the first date or is that considered slutty?}
<C>__{grampa}
<D>__{what the fuck are you saying? who the hell is talking to me?}
<A>__{tiny, growing restless, begins banging on his metal drum. klang klang klang. rufus joins in, clapping his hands.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{come on, my babies are getting restless.}
<C>__{rufus jr.}
<D>__{dump in the pit, dump in the pit, dump in the pit.}
