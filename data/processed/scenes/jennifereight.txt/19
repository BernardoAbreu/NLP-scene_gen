<D>__{would you drop these off for me?}
<A>__{sure he will and six rolls of film are handed across. "are you winning, sir?" berlin smiles and venables follows him out into the corridor. a couple of coppers on their way in. one big and morose looking called bisley. the other we've already met. tay lor is a tall balding guy with hazy reddish hair "how you doin?" berlin responds a happy "ok." with eyes returning to venables.}
<D>__{you know something strange about that hand? i think it was frozen?}
<C>__{venables}
<D>__{frozen?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{yeah. what does that mean to you?}
<A>__{apparently little. they arrive in the big room. it's deserted.}
<D>__{c'mon, venables, you're a policeman. and policemen always have an answer?}
<C>__{venables}
