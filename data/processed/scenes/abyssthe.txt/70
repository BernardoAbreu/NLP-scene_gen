<A>__{, showing the rig crew gathered around a worktable in the sub bay. the divers, bud, catfish, sonny, finler, jammer, and the four seals have their dry suits on. the pre dive briefing. lindsey, one night, and hippy will crew the submersibles. wilhite is going around clipping dosimeter badges on everybody.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{this tells us how much radiation we get?}
<C>__{hippy}
<D>__{hey, whoah... i can't handle no radiation, man. forget it! include me out.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{hippy, you pussy.}
<C>__{hippy}
<D>__{what good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{we'll take reading as we go. if the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away. simple.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{okay... hippy's not going... mcwhirter, you can run little geek.}
<A>__{bud pats the top of a small rov, sitting next to its larger brother, big geek.}
<C>__{hippy}
<D>__{no way! no way! he can't fly an rov worth shit. i will go. shit!}
<C>__{coffey}
<P>__{(to all)}
<D>__{on the dive, you will do absolutely nothing without direct orders from me, and you will follow my instructions without discussion. is this clear? alright, i want everyone finished prep and ready to get wet in fifteen minutes.}
<A>__{the rig crew disperses, picking up helmets and diving gear. some are studying the diagrams of the montana's interior layout. bud takes coffey aside as the others prepare.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{look, it's three am. these guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep. you better start cutting them some slack.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{i can't afford slack, brigman.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around. it won't work. you gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{i'm not interested in your way of doing things. just get your team ready to dive.}
<A>__{end of discussion. coffey is walking away. burning, bud crosses to his gear locker. picks up his helmet. finler is suiting out next to him.}
<C>__{finler}
<D>__{hey, you know your hand is blue?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{shut up and get your gear on.}
<A>__{nearby, monk comes over to pick his helmet up off the worktable. hippy points to the heavy equipment case that says f.b.s. deep suit mark iv.}
<C>__{hippy}
<D>__{i've been meaning to ask you what this thing is.}
<A>__{mink opens the case and shows them an unfamiliar diving suit, what looks like a space helmet, and a large backpack.}
<C>__{monk}
<D>__{fluid breathing system. we just got them. we use it if we need to go really deep.}
<C>__{hippy}
<D>__{how deep?}
<C>__{monk}
<D>__{deep.}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{it's classified... you know. anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. pressure doesn't get to you.}
<A>__{catfish is grappling with the concept.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{you're saying you get liquid in your lungs?}
<C>__{monk}
<D>__{oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion.}
<A>__{monk take a clear plastic box full of o rings off the shelf and dumps them out. he opens a valve on the backpack and allows some of the fluid inside it to drain into the box. then he take beany by the tail off hippy's shoulder.}
<C>__{hippy}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{monk}
<D>__{check this out.}
<A>__{he drops beany in the box and, before hippy can protest, closes the lid. beany is forced under the surface. he struggled for a second, and bubbles come out of his mouth. then he casually swims around in there, completely submerged... breathing liquid. catfish and the others stare into the box, amazed.}
<C>__{monk}
<D>__{see? he's diggin' it.}
<A>__{monk takes beany out and hold him by the tail for a few seconds to drain his lungs. then hands him back to hippy. the rat is annoyed, but otherwise alright.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{this is no bullshit hands down the goddamnedest thing i ever saw.}
