<A>__{the woman, matty, has walked to the rail. she stands there now lighting a cigarette. she presents her face to the ocean, hoping for a breeze. we move in on her, with racine. racine lights a new cigarette and smiles at her. she looks at him and, for an instant, her eyes race over his body, then she looks back at the ocean.}

<D>__{you can stand here with me if you want, but you'll have to agree not to talk about the heat.}
<A>__{she looks at him, and there is something startling about the directness of her gaze. when she speaks, she is cool without being hostile.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i'm a married woman.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{meaning what?}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{meaning i'm not looking for company.}
<A>__{she turns back toward the ocean.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{then you should have said 'i'm a happily married woman.'}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{that's my business.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{how happy i am.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{and how, happy is that?}
<A>__{she looks at him curiously. she begins walking slowly along the rail. he walks too.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{you're not too smart, are you?}
<A>__{racine shakes his head "no."}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i like that in a man.}

<C>__{racine}
<D>__{some. if they haven't been around much.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i wondered. thought maybe i was out of touch.}
<A>__{she stops again at the rail as a small breeze blows in from the ocean. she turns her back to it and, with her cigarette dangling from her lips, she uses both hands to lift her hair up off her nape. she closes her eyes as the air hits her. racine watches very closely.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{how 'bout i buy you a drink?}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i told you. i've got a husband.}

<D>__{he's out of town.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{my favorite kind. we'll drink to him.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{he only comes up on the weekends.}
<A>__{matty lets her hair fall and again begins moving down walkway. she drops her cigarette and steps on it.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i'm liking him better all the time. you better take me up on this quick. in another forty five minutes i'm going to give up and walk away.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{you want to buy me something? i will take one of these.}
<A>__{they have come upon a vendor selling snow cones.}

<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(to matty)}
<D>__{you're not staying in miranda beach.}
<P>__{(she shakes her head "no")}
<D>__{i would have noticed you.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{is this town that small?}
<A>__{racine hands her a snow cone. they walk over to the rail. racine watches her eat the snow cone with enormous interest.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{pinehaven. you're staying up in pinehaven, on the waterway.}
<P>__{(she gives him a look, surprised)}
<D>__{you have a house.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{how'd you know?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{you look like pinehaven.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{how does pinehaven look?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{well tended.}
<A>__{she looks out at the ocean.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{yes, i'm well tended, all right. well tended. what about you?}

<C>__{matty}
<D>__{get married.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i just need it for tonight. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<A>__{for the first time, matty laughs. a moment later, she spills the snow cone over the front of her dress. it makes a bright red stain against the white. the thin material clings to the line of her breast.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{good. nice move, matty.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{matty. i like it. right over your heart.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{at least it's cool. i'm burning up.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i asked you not to talk about the heat.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{would you get me a paper towel or something? dip it in some cold water.}
<A>__{racine starts toward the restroom nearby.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{right away. i will even wipe it off for you.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{you don't want to lick it?}
<A>__{this causes a momentary hitch in racine's retreat, but then he hurries off.}
