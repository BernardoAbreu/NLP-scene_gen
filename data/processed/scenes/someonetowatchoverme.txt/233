<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior hospital corridor near dawn}
<A>__{mike alone on a bench, his head in his hands: a couple of cops we recognize from the precinct stand a distance away, at a coffee machine, talking softly as they glance at him. it is not yet dawn. footsteps are heard coming toward; mike looks up to see garber approaching, his expression appropriate to the occasion. garber reaches him; they exchange a long look, mike's eyes etched with anguish.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{they're operating on him. he's still alive.}
<C>__{garber}
<P>__{(grim)}
<D>__{i heard.}
<A>__{a long pause, as he looks at mike.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{i heard a lot... anything you want to deny, mike?}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(almost inaudibly)}
<D>__{it should've been me...}
<A>__{garber: aware of his own dilemma.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{then it would've been her, too.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't know... but i gotta protect the precinct, too. you're on suspension, pending disciplinary hearings. don't hold your breath. and you're not to go near that woman until she's no longer under police protection and this case is closed.}
<A>__{angle on mike: responding with a silent nod as garber stands looking down at him.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{is it "love," mike? i hope so. i want it to be worth it, for your sake.}
<A>__{no response. in the response that follows, they hear movement at the end of the hall, looking up to see the silhouetted figures of ellie, with helen greening in tow. they look small, and lost, framed against a floor to ceiling window that's beginning to illuminate with the first light of day. heavy with sadness, garber turns and heads toward the women. taking a long moment. mike decides not to follow.}
<B>__{close on mike}
<A>__{camera stays at this distance as the threesome comes together. we do not hear their words, but sense the emotion by what we see. after a brief exchange of words, garber takes helen greening under his arm, and they move away leaving mike and ellie alone. closer angle: mike and ellie, gazing at each other across the gulf of their collective misery.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i'm going to visit my sister for a few days. i'd like you to get your stuff out.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what about tommy?}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{he'll live through it. they all live through it.}
<P>__{(bitter)}
<D>__{what a world, huh?}
<A>__{nothing left to say; after a long, last look, she turns to go. but stops.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{was it venza? did you get him?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{the last thing she's going to do is cry.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(her voice giving out)}
<D>__{what a shame.}
<A>__{she turns and leaves: mike gazing after her.}
