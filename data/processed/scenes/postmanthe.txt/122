<L>__{exterior town (idaho border) day}
<A>__{red and chubby finish mail call, exchange an amazed look as they're offered a platter of food.}
<L>__{exterior highway night}
<A>__{the moon hangs low over an interstate. a rider is silhouetted by the silvery orb, looking like some post apocalyptic don quixote. it's the postman.}
<L>__{exterior farmhouse country road day}
<A>__{seen from the porch, a rider gallops hard on the road beyond. a little boy comes rushing out, letter in hand. the boy pulls up short; realizes the rider is already too far gone. the boy's shoulders sag; he's crushed.}
<C>__{little boy}
<D>__{i missed him.}
<A>__{it's an almost psychic moment as the rider reins up in the distance and turns back around. a frozen beat and he starts galloping back down the road. fearless, the boy holds out the letter. the rider closes; it's the postman. the boy stretches out as far as he can. without breaking stride, the postman leans out of the saddle, snatches the letter as he passes. the boy watches after him knows what he's going to be when he grows up.}
