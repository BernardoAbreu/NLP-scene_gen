<L>__{exterior knoll night}
<A>__{med. shot. it is a moonlight night. clay squats on his heels, smoking. the rifle lies across his knees. below can be seen the campfire, and the shadowy forms of the girls as with steve's help they make up a bed under the wagon and cook the evening meal. clay suddenly reacts as o.s. a horse whinnies. standing he looks off into the darkness.}
<B>__{long shot}
<A>__{angled past clay. in the moonlight the trail stretches back over rolling hills. faintly can be heard the sound of hoofbeats. below, where the remuda grazes, a horse whinnies again. clay moves down toward the camp.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{the camp. as clay approaches. steve squats by the fire. he has spread out a tarp in the circle of firelight and mary is setting the tin plates, cups, etc., out. elaine, a blanket around her, sits near the fire. she looks tired and ill. marcia and helen are struggling with bed making under the wagon.}
<C>__{helen's voice}
<D>__{and i'm the girl who used to complain to my mother about helping with the wash.}
<A>__{steve and mary look up as clay strides up. clay starts kicking dirt over the fire.}

<A>__{steve jumps up and hurries to the wagon. clay continues kicking dirt over the fire.}
