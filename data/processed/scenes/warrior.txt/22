<L>__{exterior trackside diner morning}
<A>__{a steady rain tumbles down over an old school diner in the shadow of the railroad tracks.}
<L>__{interior diner same}
<A>__{paddy sits in a booth and takes a sip of coffee. judging by the spent sugar packets and the half eaten club sandwich, he's been there a while. the front door swings open and tommy enters wearing his watch cap and sweats. he makes his way over to the booth and plops himself down. it's clear something's on his mind but he doesn't say anything. finally, paddy engages him.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{you wanted to talk?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm gonna start fighting.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{that right?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{don't play babe in the woods with me. i know that guy from the gym came to see you.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{colt boyd? i didn't tell him anything, tommy.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{we wouldn't be sitting here now if you did.}
<A>__{tommy grabs a fry off paddy's plate.}
<C>__{tommy }
<D>__{alright. look. there's this tournament. a big tournament. top sixteen middleweights in the world. single elimination. winner take all for a lot of money. i'm gonna do that. but if i'm doin' it, then i'm gonna need a trainer. now that much you were good at.}
<P>__{(off paddy grinning)}
<D>__{no, no, no. this doesn't mean anything.}
<A>__{paddy tries to tether it down, but he's happy. tommy looks at him sternly.}
<C>__{tommy }
<D>__{i'm serious. we train. that's it. i don't wanna hear a word about anything but training, you understand? you wanna tell your war stories, you can take `em down to the vfw. you can take `em to a meeting, or church, or wherever the hell it is you go nowadays.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{what about colt boyd?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{what about him? i told him i don't train with people i don't know.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{ah, the devil you know.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{the devil you know is better than the devil you don't.}
<A>__{tommy looks at him. grins for the first time.}
<C>__{paddy }
<D>__{chasing theogenes. it'll be kinda like old times.}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{i just told you, this doesn't mean anything. you get that through your skull right now or i'm walking.}
<A>__{paddy calmly sips his coffee, then leans in on tommy with a stern look. the old lion's got a few teeth left.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{alright. alright. but you get something through your skull, too. you called me. so don't go threatening to walk every five minutes. and since this is about training, you dump whatever it is you need to dump as far as those pills are concerned. i don't want to see `em.}
<A>__{tommy gives him a hard look, but the old man doesn't shy away.}
<C>__{paddy }
<D>__{in fact, hand `em over right now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i know they're on you, tommy. you sounded like a goddamn maraca coming through the door.}
<A>__{tommy considers, then reaches into his pocket and slides two bottles across the table.}
<C>__{paddy }
<D>__{that's not gonna do.}
<P>__{(shaking bottles)}
<D>__{when you came through that door it was chhh chhh chhh.}
<P>__{(holding up 3 fingers)}
<D>__{three.}
<A>__{tommy looks at him. fishes another bottle out of his pocket and flips it on the table.}
<C>__{paddy }
<P>__{(off french fries)}
<D>__{and another thing, you don't eat crap like this. this is for losers and old men.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and we're gonna have to bunk up. if we're gonna do this right, you gotta stay at the house.}
<C>__{paddy }
<D>__{i watch your diet, we follow the old regimen. you copy?}
<A>__{the two men stare at each other. tommy looks furious, but he doesn't get up. a silent, tenuous agreement is reached.}
<C>__{paddy }
<D>__{copy.}
