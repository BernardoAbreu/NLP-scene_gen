<D>__{ah, treves...}
<A>__{treves sits in the armchair. carr gomm is sitting at his desk.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{have you contacted the british home and the royal hospital?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{ah, no sir. i had planned to see them in the morning.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{good! how is the patient?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{he's doing very well. in fact that's why i came to see you. i think that if i were to present mr. merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. if the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, i'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{a few words? i thought he was imbecile?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{well sir, perhaps i should explain...}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{i really don't think that's necessary treves. i'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i don't agree. no one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. no doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{no, treves, it's out of the question. now if it was up to me, i'd say "certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," i'm sorry, i simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{mr. treves, it's out of the question. i want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{hallway staircase the london we see treves leave carr gomm's office and walk toward us to the stairwell. as treves begins down the stairs, he sees bytes on the next landing coming up. bytes spots him and goes toward him.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{i want my man back.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{just a moment, how did you get in here?}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{never mind that, i want my man!}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{he's still very sick. please come downstairs with me. i will explain the situation.}
<C>__{bytes}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{don't... don't muck me about. you've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, now. do you understand me? now, mr. treves. we had a bargain!}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{you misunderstood. this man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. he's my patient now and i must do what...}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{pull the other one, why don't you! we made a deal!}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{he's a freak! that's how they live. we're partners, him and i, business partners. you're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{all you do is profit from another man's misery!}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{you think you're better 'n me? you wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. so i gave him to you. on trust, in the name of science! and now i want him back.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{you don't own this man!}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{i want him back!}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{so you can beat him? so you can starve him? a dog in the street would fare better with you!}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{i've got my rights, damn you, and i'm going to the authorities!}
<C>__{carr }
<D>__{well, go to the authorities...}
<A>__{now we see carr gomm standing above them, at the top of the stairs.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{by all means do so. in fact, i will fetch them myself. i'm quite sure they'd be very interested in your story, as well as ours.}
<A>__{livid, bytes looks from carr gomm to treves, at a loss for words.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{now i think we really do understand one another.}
<C>__{bytes}
<P>__{(venomously)}
<D>__{right... right.}
<A>__{he backs slowly down to the landing eyeing treves and carr gomm. at the landing he casually turns and disappears down more stairs. treves turns and gazes at carr gomm.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{singularly unpleasant chap... uh... i don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, mr. treves.}
<C>__{treves}
<P>__{(gratefully)}
<D>__{thank you very much sir. shall we say in a few days then?}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?}
<C>__{treves}
<P>__{(slightly taken aback)}
<D>__{wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{two o'clock then... you know treves... it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{...yes, sir.}
<A>__{they part company. we follow treves down the stairs.}
<C>__{treves}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{two o'clock?}
<A>__{then we follow carr gomm to his office door. he stops short.}

<D>__{elephant man? i don't want to meet an elephant man.}
<A>__{hallways the london (night) again, the hospital is closing down for the night. lights go off in each hallway. the staff is vacating the hospital. as the last light goes off, we hear the great iron door slam shut. treves' house bedroom (night) anne is at her dressing table, brushing out her hair. she is in a very flattering dressing gown, ready to turn in. we see her reflected in the mirror as well as treves who is in his robe in the background seated at his side of their bed, deep in thought. anne looks at treves and smiles affectionately.}

<P>__{(coyly)}
<D>__{freddie?}

<C>__{anne}
<D>__{freddie?... freddie, don't look so discouraged.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i shouldn't be. we made great progress today. i taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. he did rather well, too, but i had to lead him every step of the way. though frankly, at times i was unsure of who was leading whom.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{well, i wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all i wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but i thought you said that he was rather... simple?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{he is. i mean, i've always thought he was. i think he must be. is he simple? or is that just something i've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?}
<A>__{anne puts down the brush and rises.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i don't know. i can't explain it. if this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then i'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best i can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. but! if he's an imbecile, who's body i can't treat and who's mind i can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. they can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, i won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. and that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?}
<A>__{anne, sympathizing with his concerns goes to him and puts her arms around him.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this elephant man with qualities he doesn't possess?}
<C>__{treves}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{and what qualities are those? intelligence or stupidity?}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(slightly hurt)}
<D>__{i'm sure i don't know, freddie.}
<A>__{she releases treves and lies down. treves realizes that perhaps he has been unkind.}

<C>__{anne}
<D>__{well, these things take time.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when carr gomm meets him. somehow, between now and then i've got to make john merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... why am i fooling myself? nothing short of john delivering the sermon on the mount is going to sway carr gomm...}

<A>__{merrick is propped up in bed. suddenly the door bursts open. the night porter, an arm around a drunken giggling tart, stands in the doorway. as soon as the charwoman sees merrick, she screams as does merrick, and she wriggles free, making for the stairs. the night porter watches her go and then turns to merrick laughing noisily. he then pulls the door shut with a bang. merrick, very frightened, crawls down into his hiding place. bedroom (morning) we see anne alone in bed, asleep. treves is finished dressing and leaves the room. the sound of the door closing awakens anne. she looks around for treves. a clock reads 5:30.}

<C>__{treves}
<D>__{it's only a physical problem. he has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. but he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. so if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and i will make it clear.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{speaking is one thing, treves, but can the man comprehend?}
<A>__{treves cannot easily answer this question.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{...as i said, it's only a physical problem... but i do feel that mr. merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{he needn't. i have no desire to cause him any discomfort. did you make those inquiries we spoke about?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{yes, i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for incurables. i'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{fine, fine. you know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, treves. but you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.}

<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{the door opens and treves and carr gomm enter. carr gomm's eyes are rivited on merrick, but he contains his shock. merrick is breathing unevenly, his eyes still closed. treves goes to him and touches his shoulder. merrick opens his eyes and looks up at treves. treves turns to carr gomm, as does merrick. carr gomm lowers his eyes.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{john, may i introduce you to sir carr gomm.}

<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{...i... everyone has been very kind to me.}

<P>__{(to john)}
<D>__{thank you, john. you did very well.}
<A>__{treves and carr gomm go out the door onto the landing. merrick sees his chance escaping him and tries to recapture their attention.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(his voice is gaining strength)}
<D>__{the lord is my shepherd, i shall not want. he maketh me to lie down in green pastures...}
<P>__{(he continues through the following dialogue)}
<A>__{treves and carr gomm are alone on the landing, speaking quietly.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{it was a nice try, treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{yes, i'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. i just felt that i had to do anything i could to protect him.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{i'm sorry too. he simply doesn't belong here. he's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. believe me, frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. good day.}
<A>__{merrick has come to the end of what treves taught him to say. he makes one last, desperate attempt to be heard. treves, disheartened, stands on the landing as carr gomm starts down the stairs.}
<C>__{merrick }
<P>__{(now full voice)}
<D>__{yea, though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death, i will fear no evil, for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me...}
<A>__{treves is staring, open mouthed, back into the room. carr gomm looks up at him.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{what is it, treves?}
<C>__{merrick }
<D>__{thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, thou anointest my head with oil...}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i didn't teach him that part!}
<A>__{treves rushes back into the room, followed by carr gomm.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{my cup runneth over. surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life, and i shall dwell in the house of the lord forever.}
<A>__{there is a long silence as all three men stare at each other.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{how did you, know the rest? i never taught you the rest of it.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{tell me, john, how did you know the rest of the 23rd psalm?}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(hesitantly)}
<D>__{i... i used to read the bible every day. i know it very well. the bible, and the book of common prayer. the 23rd psalm is very beautiful.}

<D>__{of course, sir. thank you, thank you very much.}
<A>__{carr gomm stops on the stairs.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{treves. well done.}

<D>__{not me, sir. mr. merrick. he succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.}
<B>__{isolation ward}
<A>__{merrick is on the bed, propped up by pillows. the door opens. treves comes in, shuts the door and leans against it. they look at each other for a moment.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? why didn't you tell me you could read?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{you did not ask me.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i never thought to ask. how can you ever forgive me?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{oh, no do not say that. you have been so kind to me. i was afraid to say too much. people always want me to be quiet. you wanted me to speak, but i was afraid. forgive me.}

<D>__{we do have a lot to talk about, don't we?}
<A>__{carr gomm's office carr gomm is seated at the window, looking out silently. there is a knock at the door and treves enters. he quietly closes the door and walks to the window. carr gomm never moves.}

<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i could easily arrange...}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{no, not that way. broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. it makes them queasy... do you have any photographs of mr. merrick?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{well, yes.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{excellent. we shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. i want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. you and i shall vouch for his inner qualities.}

<A>__{merrick is in bed, very tired. it's been an exhausting day. suddenly the door opens and mothershead comes into the room. merrick looks up at her very apprehensively. she walks over to the bed, picks up the bible from the table, opens it and hands it to merrick.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{read it.}

<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{i hear you have some trouble sleepin'...}

<D>__{head's too heavy, eh?}
<A>__{he pulls merrick all the way down onto the bed, so that he is prone, struggling for breath.}

<C>__{carr}
<D>__{as far as i can see, the only obstacle might be broadneck. he has enormous influence over the others, very old school, not an easy man to impress. in any case, if worse does come to worse, we still have the british and royal homes to fall back on, don't we.}
<A>__{treves is silent. they stop.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{don't we?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{no, we don't. their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take mr. merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. they don't want him.}

<C>__{treves }
<D>__{...due to the progressive nature of the disease, i feel sure that the patient does not have much longer to live.}

<C>__{treves}
<D>__{forgive the redundancy, gentlemen, but there is no other place for him. both the royal hospital and the british home have turned him down even if sufficient funds for his care were provided. the workhouse is certainly out of the question. the patient has an overwhelming fear of returning to the horrors of his past. his appearance is so disturbing that all shrink from him. he cannot, in justice to others, be put in the general ward of the workhouse. the police rightly prevent his being exhibited, and he is mobbed in the streets wherever he goes. what is to be done with him?}

<D>__{i, for one, am sick and tired of this competitive freak hunting by these overly ambitious young doctors, trying to make names for themselves. to parade then about in front of the pathological society is one thing, but to waste this committee's valuable time with requests for shelter for these abominations of nature is quite another.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{gentlemen, john merrick is not an animal, he is a man, fully aware of his condition. an intelligent, sensitive, literate man, with an intimate knowledge of the bible. his horrible infirmities do not reduce him to anything less than what he is, a man; and it would be criminal if we of the london hospital, his final refuge, the last place on earth where this man can find peace, were to cast him out.}
<A>__{carr gomm, from his chair on the committee, pounds his gavel.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{gentlemen, may i make a suggestion. there are two small rooms off bedstead square that are no longer in use and would be admirably suited to mr. merrick's needs. i also propose to write a letter to the times, appealing to their readers for assistance. knowing the generosity of the british public, i feel we would have little trouble in raising the funds for his maintenance. indeed, this hospital's rules do preclude the admission of incurables, but if ever there was an exception to the rule, it is this patient. so therefore, i propose, if mr. treves is finished, that we put it to a vote. all those in favor of keeping mr. merrick here?}
<A>__{carr gomm and another committee member raise their hands. broadneck is displeased.}
<C>__{broadneck}
<D>__{one moment,}
<P>__{(showing the picture of merrick)}
<D>__{as far as i'm concerned this creature has no business being in our hospital. i think mr. carr gomm's letter would be an excellent idea,}
<P>__{(to carr gomm)}
<D>__{and when you appeal for funds, i think you should appeal for a more appropriate place for him as well. i agree the british public is generous, and i'm sure that somewhere the creature will find a happy and permanent home, but not here.}
<A>__{one of the committee members says "i quite agree". carr gomm scowls a bit.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{i see. all, then, that move we keep mr. merrick here?}
<A>__{carr gomm raises his hand. none of the others do. treves and carr gomm exchange hopeless glances. carr gomm looks at the man who had originally raised his hand. he looks away, ashamed.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{all those opposed?}
<A>__{broadneck and the rest raise their hands.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{broadneck}
<P>__{(triumphantly)}
<D>__{well then. in the meantime, of course, he needn't be turned out. he may stay in the rooms off bedstead square until such time as more suitable arrangements can be made, thus freeing the isolation ward for more deserving patients. well then, mr. chairman, if there is nothing further to discuss, i move that we adjourn this meeting and all go bout our normal business.}
<A>__{carr gomm cannot conceal his contempt.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{i second the motion gentlemen. this meeting is adjourned.}
<A>__{the others cough their agreement and hurriedly leave the room. treves walks over to the committee table and takes the paper off the photograph. he stares sadly at merrick's picture.}
<C>__{carr }
<D>__{somehow i don't think they quite understand.}
<B>__{theatre dressing room}
<A>__{we see a very lovely woman seated in a chair before a mirror. she is reading aloud from the times. her hair is being brushed by a young girl.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{...terrible though his appearance is, so terrible indeed that women and nervous persons fly in terror from the sight of him, and that he is debarred from seeking to earn his livelihood in any ordinary way, yet he is superior in intelligence, can read and write, is quiet, gentle, not to say even refined in his mind.}
<A>__{she turns to the girl thoughtfully.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i'd very much like to meet that gentleman. he sounds almost shakespearean.}
<A>__{dining hall the london the room is elegantly furnished and heavily carpeted. the walls are panelled in richly gleaming walnut with finely wrought brass lamps spaced regularly along their length. in the center of the room is a long oak table with a fine linen table cloth, around which sits a number of doctors, among them, fox. some of them are still eating. a waiter is clearing away a few plates and several doctors are helping themselves to port wine kept in decanters in the center of the table and to cigars in humidors. one of them is reading the times. at one end of the table sits treves, picking at his food.}
<D>__{#1 doctor "...in life until he came under the kind care of the nursing staff of the london hospital and the surgeon who has befriended him..." #2 doctor good publicity for the hospital, at any rate. #3 doctor treves comes off well too, eh freddie? #4 doctor it was pleasant of you to join us this evening, frederick. #2 doctor your elephant man dining out this evening? #4 doctor i understand the kitchen ran out of hay this morning.}
<A>__{the group laughs.}
<C>__{fox}
<P>__{(slightly sourly)}
<D>__{do continue reading, mr. stanley, please. #1 doctor "...it is a case of singular affliction brought about through no fault of himself; he can but hope for quiet and privacy during a life which mr. treves assures me is not likely to be long,"}
<A>__{there is a short pause.}
<D>__{#4 doctor the elephant man. makes you sound rather more like a zoo keeper than a surgeon, frederick.}
<A>__{the group again laughs. treves clears his throat and rises.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{excuse me gentlemen. i seem to have lost my appetite. good evening.}
<A>__{treves leaves the room.}
<D>__{#4 doctor i say, what's he on about? #3 doctor he's getting a bit of a swelled head, if you ask me.}
<C>__{fox}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{well, no one did ask you atkins. frederick treves is not only the most skillful surgical operator here, he's also a humanitarian of the highest order. you sound like a pack of whining school boys with your petty jealousies. #3 doctor look here, fox, i simply said.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{oh belt up!}
<A>__{a deep silence falls over the doctors. bedstead square rooms (night) we see a small, very dusty, dirty room, filled with boxes and bedsteads and other things stored over the years. the one grimy window is locked shut. the door opens and two middle aged charwomen enter. they look around at the room with distaste and drop their mops and buckets.}
<D>__{1st woman there are cleaner rooms in the gasworks.}
<A>__{she reaches into her apron pocket and pulls out a pint bottle of gin. she takes a drink and passes it to her friend.}
<D>__{1st woman who's all the fuss for, then? 2nd woman}
<P>__{(wiping her mouth)}
<D>__{don't you know? it's for that strange one. 1st woman mr. treves' elephant man? i hear he's got a trunk. 2nd woman right, right.}
<A>__{the 1st woman takes the bottle and walks across the room. she forces open the balky window and sits on the sill.}
<D>__{2nd woman blimey, now we're cleanin' up for circus animals!}
<A>__{the 1st woman, laughing, takes another healthy swig from the bottle. we see past her through the window, the dark silhouette of the main spire of st. philip's cathedral against the sky. it fills the screen.}
