<L>__{exterior entertainment street night}
<A>__{zam exits the crashed speeder and runs. anakin picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street. it's the seedy underbelly of the city. broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. it's pretty crowded with various alien low lifes, panhandling droids, and the occasional group of upperclass slummers. anakin barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing zam. he loses the bounty hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. the young jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd. ahead, zam turns in through a door and disappears. a nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. anakin is just about to follow zam when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. people start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. obi wan gets out and walks over, holding out anakin's lightsaber.}
