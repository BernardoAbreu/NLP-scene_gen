<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior passenger car day}
<A>__{david sits with his coat on his lap. he's wearing a tie. he doesn't look very comfortable in it. he feels a stare. he looks up to find a girl, six or seven years old, peering at him from over the seat in front of him. she just gazes at him blankly. he gives her a small forced smile. she doesn't react. david returns his head to the window. his eyes begin to shut with the lulling movement of the train.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you alone?}
<A>__{david looks in the direction of the voice. a woman with dark hair and light blue eyes stands in the aisle with two bags over her shoulder. she's wearing a tight white t shirt and jeans. she's beautiful. david nods "yes." the woman starts putting her bags on the shelf above the seats. she stretches to get them up. her toned stomach is exposed. she has a silver ring pierced through her navel. david has a gold ring on his hand. he fiddles with it. beat. he gently slips off his wedding band. it goes into his coat pocket. the woman takes the seat next to him. beat. a loud violent burst of sound. the passenger car shakes as a passing train barrels by two feet from david's window. it passes in a few seconds. the car returns to a quiet hum. david pulls a magazine out from the seat pocket in front of him. he holds the woman's fashion magazine out.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{someone left these. you want one?}
<A>__{the woman looks over the one being offered and then points to the sports illustrated peeking out of the seat pocket. david pulls the magazine out and gives it to her.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you like sports?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{it's my field. i represent athletes. i'm an agent.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what a coincidence? i'm a male synchronized swimmer and i'm looking for representation.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{but i'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.}
<A>__{the woman laughs.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you represent someone in philadelphia?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i'm meeting a player from temple university. he's a cornerback. you like football?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{not really.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{this kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. he runs the fifty in under six seconds. he's going to be a god.}
<A>__{beat. david studies the excitement in her eyes. another loud violent burst of sound. david waits till the opposing train passes. the woman goes back to her magazine. beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm david dunne.}
<A>__{the woman looks up.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{kelly.}
<A>__{she goes back to the magazine. beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{how long are you staying in philly?}
<A>__{kelly looks up from her sports illustrated. her striking blue eyes gaze at david. beat. she holds up her hand. taps the diamond ring on her finger.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i'm married.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{an awkward silence.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i think you got the wrong idea.}
<A>__{the woman stares at david. she looks down. beat. closes the magazine.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i'm going to find another seat.}
<A>__{kelly gets up. she balances herself against a headrest as the train rumbles. she starts to the back of the car. david sits alone. he looks like he's drowning, but there's no water. he feels a stare. he glances up. the little girl spies on him from between the seats. david leans towards the window to avoid eye contact. his hand reaches into his coat and slides out his wedding band. he puts it back on. his temple touches the glass. the vibration of the train begins to lull his eyes closed... beat. david's head bounces lightly against the window. the shaking of the glass never allows david's eyes to completely close. he sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger. he looks out the window. the scenery blurs as it flies by. beat. david turns. some of the other passengers start to react as they realize the train is picking up speed. the normal bumps of the tracks become amplified. the worried voices of the travelers start fill the cabin. the train goes faster.}
<B>__{and then the high pitched metal on metal screeching starts as the train begins to take a curve.}
<A>__{david's eyes move to the seat in front of him. the little girl is no longer watching him. david looks to the passengers across from him. he sees the ground slowly drop away in the windows behind them as their side of the train starts to rise...}
<B>__{the passengers scream as the amtrak passenger train begins to tilt off the track...}
