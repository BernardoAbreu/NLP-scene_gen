<A>__{establishing the different student factions. music, playing over a public address system, fills the quad. trevor, now an interloper, crossing the senior lawn, openly searching for cesar. tag bangers, a clique of eight or nine k.o.s. wanna be(s). feature paco (16) as they take quick hits off a blunt. now cesar extinguishes the blunt with his fingertips and hides it as trevor wanders into their midst.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(glances around; sniffs)}
<D>__{been smokin' the chronic, cesar?}
<C>__{cesar}
<P>__{(a smirk)}
<D>__{i'm hooked on phonics... not 'hooked on chronic.'}
<A>__{laughs all around.}

<P>__{(not amused)}
<D>__{you wouldn't happen t'know who vandalized bungalow eighty six last night?}
<C>__{cesar}
<P>__{(feigning ignorance)}
<D>__{you guys know anything about that?}
<P>__{(off silence)}
<D>__{sorry, maestro... nada.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{garcia may not think there's enough here to prove anything. but you and i both know who's responsible. don't we?}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{whadda you, a narc? seriously, i don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about.}
<A>__{trevor maintains his fervent demeanor. now he notices the ring on cesar's right index finger. insert cesar's ring emblazoned with a green marijuana leaf.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{the ring, cesar... lemme have it.}
<A>__{cesar dramatically jerks back his finger.}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{watch it, eh... that's my trigger finger.}
<A>__{as cesar, with purpose, aims an invisible gun at trevor...}

<D>__{... bang.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(momentous deliberation)}
<D>__{... are you finished?}
<A>__{cesar starts to laugh. a crowd begins to gather.}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{what? finished with what? don't get crazy on me, dude.}
<A>__{the boisterous crowd escalates... hoots and hollers. after weighing the situation, trevor exchanges palpable looks with cesar. now he reluctantly back pedals, squeezing his way past the wall of bodies pressed in behind him. his departure across an empty lawn is accompanied by a hail of "boos" and taunts.}
