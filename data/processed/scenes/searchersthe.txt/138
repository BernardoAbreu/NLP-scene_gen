<L>__{interior futterman's trading post full shot day}
<A>__{it is a grimy establishment with some dusty trade goods on shelves; a counter which serves as a bar; a few plank tables and benches. the breed seen outside enters and crosses to a side table where another mean looking hombre sits preparing to play a game of solitaire with a deck of limp cards. ethan and martin are at a table in the center of the room, examining a dirty, rumpled child's dress debbie's. martin nods soberly in answer to ethan's inquiring look; yes, it's hers. both look up as futterman crosses from the bar, carrying a whisky jug and two dirty glasses his fingers thrust inside the glasses. futterman is a squaw man and a killer dead eyes in a white face.}
<C>__{futterman}
<D>__{drink?}
<A>__{he sets the jug down, picks up one of the glasses so grey and thumb printed it is almost opaque. both ethan and martin regard it with disgust. futterman gives a slight shrug, takes the dress and starts to wipe the dirty glass with it. martin snatches it out of his hand.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(harshly)}
<D>__{how'd you come by this?}
<C>__{futterman}
<D>__{you said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{that's what i said.}
<C>__{futterman}
<D>__{you got it with you?}
<A>__{ethan looks at him and beyond toward the two men.}
