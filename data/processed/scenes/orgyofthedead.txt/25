<L>__{exterior woods. night.}
<A>__{at the car accident scene with bob and shirley, slow jazz music is audible from the nearby festivities in the cemetery. bob and shirley are still sitting on the ground, looking toward the source of the music.}
<C>__{criswell }
<D>__{ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin! may it ever be so adventurous!}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{i'm so frightened.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{well we certainly can't stay here. c'mon.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{in there.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{it frightens me.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{then..then what's that music?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{that's what i want to find out. we have to get help.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{what help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{something's making that music.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{i'm not sure i care to find out what it is.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{all right. don't worry, i will be right beside you.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{what help will that do if something in there isn't dead?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{not dead? in a cemetery?}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{i can't imagine anything dead playing that music.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find. they'll have a telephone. c'mon.}
<A>__{bob helps shirley up from the ground and leads her into the thick bushes.}
