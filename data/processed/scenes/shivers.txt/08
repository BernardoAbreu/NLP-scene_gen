<A>__{tudor leaves his apartment, closing the door behind him (we see the number clearly). he walks down the hallway on automatic pilot, obviously preoccupied, turning the corner leading to the elevators without perceiving what he is seeing. at the elevators he hesitates for a moment, then presses the up button. when the door opens, he steps in.}

<D>__{wood grain paneling, strong, silent, fireproof, fast, cushioned ride. everything you could want in an elevator.}
<A>__{nobody says another word until the doors spring open and merrick, after a wink at tudor, hustles the svibens out of the elevator. as the doors close, merrick's voice floats back to tudor.}

<D>__{notice how the entranceways to all the apartments are recessed and individually lit... nope, it's down that way, brenda. that's it... recessed and individually lit...}
<A>__{once the door has closed, tudor presses the button for the top floor. as the elevator ascends, he takes out his wallet and removes a key from a zippered compartment.}
