<L>__{interior topeka dressing room night}
<A>__{russell's hair is slicked with sweat from a show just finished. he is shirtless with a towel around his shoulders. luggage for the next city is stacked by the door.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{fire away. i'm ready. i'm on the "you" train. take me there.}
<A>__{the kid plugs in his microphone. russell listens as he springs his first question.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{do you have to be depressed to write a sad song? do you have to be in love to write a love song? is a song better if it really happened to you? like, "if you say nothing"... where did you write that and how did it come about?}
<A>__{russell admires the many questions. says nothing. he looks at his hand, thinks.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{when did you get so professional?}
<A>__{in the background, penny lane irons silent ed's shirt. grinning, she cuffs his shoulder. to the shirtless silent drummer, waiting for his shirt.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{i'm almost done with my shirt.}
<A>__{ed watches her appreciatively, drumming silently on a rubber pad. penny kisses russell, who swings her onto his lap. in the corner, jeff watches them all with a vague feeling of being underappreciated. and now dick enters with a large cardboard box.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{russell, your dad showed up again. and on a lighter note.}
<P>__{(importantly)}
<D>__{gentlemen. your first t shirts have arrived.}
<A>__{there is an immediate buzz in the room, as dick yanks open the box filled with new white t shirts. he untangles the first fresh shirt, and displays it proudly. a silent beat as all examine it their first t shirt. faces fall. ed stops drumming. there has been a mistake. it is a fuzzy band photo with the group name emblazoned below. only russell, who stand out front, is colored in and emphasized on the shirt. he turns away, making a noise. jeff stares at the t shirt. he's just about in tears. there is a long silence and then... ed resumes drumming on the rubber pad.}
<C>__{dick }
<D>__{it's the record company's mistake. and they will pay.}
<A>__{shirts gone, band}
<D>__{happy.}
<A>__{he drops the offending shirt into the trash, as if it were contaminated, and exits with the box. william watches as the two men, russell and jeff, move to opposite sides of the room. russell puts on a shirt, so does jeff. the vibe is thick. russel turns to see jeff staring at him.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{can we just skip the vibe and go straight to us laughing about this?}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{yeah. okay.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(trying for a joke)}
<D>__{because i can see by your face you want to get into this }
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{how can you tell? i'm just one of the out of focus guys.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{here we go.}
<A>__{william watches as russell fishes the t shirt out of the trash.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{here. take it. you love this shirt it lets you say everything you want to say.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{well, it speaks pretty loudly to me.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{it's a t shirt.}
<A>__{russell turns away.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i'm always gonna tell you the truth.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{are you doing coke again? jeff oh yeah. all the time.}
<A>__{the kid looks down.}
<C>__{jeff }
<D>__{this is big stuff, man. from the very beginning we said i'm the front man and you're the guitarist with mystique. that's the dynamic we agreed on page, plant... mick, keith. but somehow it's all turning around. we have got to control what's happening to us. there's a responsibility here }
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{excuse me, but didn't we all get into this to avoid responsibility?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{forgive me.}
<P>__{(continuing, on shirt)}
<D>__{but this is the slow moving train of compromise that will kill us.}
<A>__{russell makes a disgusted noise. penny lane exits discreetly, looking back at william.}
<C>__{jeff }
<D>__{i can't say anymore with a writer here.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{you can trust him, you can say whatever you want.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(eyes suddenly moist)}
<D>__{i works as hard or harder than anybody on that stage. you know what i do i connect.}
<A>__{i get people off. i look}
<D>__{for the guy who isn't getting off, and i make him get off.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{actually, that you can printerior}
<P>__{(continues to russell)}
<D>__{and yet, why do i always end up feeling like i'm a joke to you? i feel nothing but love for you. we're a family.}
<A>__{he looks at the t shirt and starts to cry. embarrassed, he grows angrier.}
<C>__{jeff }
<D>__{you want to pretend this isn't going to be a very big band. well it is. you call yourself a leader of this band, but your direction allowed the t shirt, when you allowed dick to manage us, 'cause he's your friend... don't you see? the t shirt is everything.}
<A>__{it's everything.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{is it my turn? because i think we should, for once, say what we really mean.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{oh, this is the part where you quit }
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(stiffening)}
<D>__{right. i'm so predictable.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{no i gotta tell the truth i want you to like me. but sometimes i feel like you collect people who love you and then very skillfully... you make them feel bad that they're not good enough for you.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{stick to singing, brother, 'cause you ain't gonna make it as a shrink.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{deal with it! and let me just say what nobody else wants to say to you }
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{your looks have become a problem.}
