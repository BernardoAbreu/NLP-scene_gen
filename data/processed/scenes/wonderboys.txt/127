<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{grady lies in a powder blue paper gown surrounded by blue plastic curtains in a blue room. through a gap in the curtains, he can see the bottle of glucose that drips slowly into his arm, and beyond, a window. flakes of snow fall outside. the door squeals, a shadow ripples across the blue, then the curtains part and a resident with a clipboard appears. his nametag says greenhut.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i passed out.}
<C>__{greenhut}
<D>__{you did.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i've been doing that a lot lately.}
<C>__{greenhut}
<D>__{so i hear. you've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, i understand.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{do you think that's why i've been having these...}
<P>__{(grabbing james' term)}
<D>__{... spells?}
<C>__{greenhut}
<D>__{how long have you been having them?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{the last month maybe.}
<C>__{greenhut}
<D>__{how long have you been smoking marijuana?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{spiro t. agnew was vice president, i believe.}
<C>__{greenhut}
<D>__{that's probably not the problem, then. what about your lifestyle. any major changes recently?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i've been trying to finish a book...}
<C>__{greenhut}
<D>__{and your wife left you.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{is that in my chart?}
<C>__{greenhut}
<D>__{i spoke with the woman who saved your life. you're lucky she came along when she did.}
<A>__{grady considers the larger ramifications of this statement}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{greenhut}
<P>__{(tapping the glucose bottle)}
<D>__{you need to see a doctor, mr. tripp. an internist. and i think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{she told you about. . .}
<C>__{greenhut}
<D>__{her dog, yes.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{actually, it was her husband's dog...}
<A>__{greenhut glances up, looking grady in the eyes for the first time, and grady stops.}
<C>__{greenhut}
<D>__{look, mr. tripp. you have a drug problem, all right? on top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. we pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. as for your spells. i'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{they're anxiety attacks? that's a little disappointing.}
<C>__{greenhut}
<D>__{better luck next time.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{so is my friend...is sara still here?}
<C>__{greenhut}
<D>__{no. there's no one here.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i have to see her. as soon as possible.}
<A>__{greenhut studies grady, calibrating the desperation in his eyes, then takes a quick glance at his watch.}
<C>__{greenhut}
<D>__{look, mr. tripp. if you really want to leave, i can't stop you. but i'm going to write you a prescription for a course of ampicillin and i want you to follow it to the end no matter how stupid you decide to be with everything else. all right?}
