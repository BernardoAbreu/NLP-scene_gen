<A>__{i e. rover moon surface morning sam at the wheel in his space suit, speeding towards the first of the harvesters, known as matthew. harvester matthew as sam gets closer to the harvester, he suddenly sees something: the girl. she is standing maybe a hundred yards away in her yellow dress, resembling a flame or a flower in the barren and colorless landscape. she appears to be staring directly at sam's rover.}

<A>__{his face unfolding with panic, alarm, curiosity. an intense, yearning, curiosity. he drives closer. but like in a dream, sam can't seem to make up any distance between the rover and the girl. he crushes the accelerator peddle. for a moment sam drives right alongside the harvester, clouds of lunar dust being kicked up, cascading against the side window. but sam is looking away from the harvester, focussed on the girl. on sam: he doesn't notice matthew (the harvester) suddenly veer right, slamming into the side of the rover and causing sam to lose control. the steering wheel swings left and right as sam desperately tries to straighten the path of the vehicle, but a split second later the rover is flipped like a matchbox, and spun into the path of the harvester a hideous screech of mangled metal the rover gobbled up by the front of the harvester, devoured. the rover is jammed under the harvester's monstrous axle, resembling a crushed beer can in a fist and with a big, booming groan the harvester slides to a standstill. wide shot: silence. the harvester stationary. the rover caught beneath it. no sign of the girl.}
