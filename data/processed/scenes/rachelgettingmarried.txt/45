<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what do you mean she lied?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{she lied to the people who were working with her. who were trying to help her. she lies to everybody.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(not getting it)}
<D>__{where is she now?}
<C>__{rachel}

<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(disbelieving)}
<D>__{are you kidding me?}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{why would anything i said or didn't say at the hospital hurt you? it wasn't about you!}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{why not? why wasn't it about me?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{rachel...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{dad, stop.}
<P>__{(to kym)}
<D>__{why not? i was hopeful. i was on your side. i still am. do you have any idea what that means? do you have any idea how lonely it was with everybody gone into your terrible world? there was nothing left. everybody was just empty. you think they remembered i was alive or needed anything during your... life? and after all that loneliness and mom and dad blaming each other and worrying and death and divorce and that stupid hopefulness and dad not even being able to listen to music, you were in the hospital, lying about us! instead of telling the truth about yourself!}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{god, rachel...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{wait a minute. wait a minute. what's this all about?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{apparently she has a whole history of sexual molestation.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{kym, what is your sister saying? did you say you were sexually molested?}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{oh jesus christ. not by you! it was a long time ago!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{were you?}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{why in god's name would you say something like that?}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{it was anonymous! it seemed like a good idea at the time.}
<A>__{the three on the couch are stunned for a moment.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{dad, look at me. i'm right here. i'm telling you that after ethan died i wanted her to get better or just die...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{and look! she is better!}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{nice, rachel. thank you.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(to paul)}
<D>__{...and dad, she was lying and she didn't give a shit about the rest of us. recovery can't work if you lie. she knows that. i was worthless to her. we all meant nothing to her.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{you're not worthless. you're my sister. i love you guys. i need you guys, but you don't get to sit around for the rest of my life deciding what i'm supposed to be like. you weren't there. you weren't inside my head when i was fucked up and your certainly not there now. you haven't got a clue what i feel.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{kym, you took ethan for granted. you were high for his life. you were not present for his life. you were high. he was like a pet to you. you drove him off the bridge. and now he's dead.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it was an accident.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{yes! i was stoned out of my mind! jesus christ, who do i have to be now? mother theresa? did i use up all the love i'm allowed for this lifetime because i killed our little brother?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, it was an accident!}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{i'm sorry! i'm sorry, okay? i'm sorry!}
<A>__{paul bursts out weeping.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it was an accident.}
<A>__{kym, her hair still in foils, rushes out of the house. carol turns to rachel. rachel bolts upstairs. carol turns to paul. paul waves her away. carol is bawling too.}
