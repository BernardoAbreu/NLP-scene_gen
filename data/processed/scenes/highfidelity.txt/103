<C>__{rob}
<D>__{hey charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey rob.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{why did you break up with me for marco?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(on her feet)}
<D>__{fuck! i knew it! you're going through one of those what does it all mean things.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{there's been a rash of them, recently. i find it a little unnerving. in fact marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and i wasn't really up for it. do all men go through this?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{c'mon, just answer the question. you can say what you like. what the hell?}
<A>__{charlie looks off at a corner of the ceiling, musters a look of "contemplation."}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... it wasn't that i really liked marco more. in fact i thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him. it was just that he knew he was good looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow. you used to act as if i was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what i mean. your self image started to rub off on me and i ended up thinking that i was strange. and i knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and i dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and marco seemed a bit more, i don't know, glamorous? more sure of himself?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{less hard work, because i felt like i was dragging you around, sort of.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{a little sunnier. sparkier.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i don't know. you know what people are like at that age. they make very superficial judgements. do you think that's superficial? he was a clown, if it's any consolation.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{did you tell that to marco when he did his what does it all mean thing with you?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{oh god, no. i didn't want to hurt his feelings.}
