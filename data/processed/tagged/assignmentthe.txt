<A>__{camera pulls back and up to reveal ever more scenes of life on this particular street. the woman shouts at the children from her window and the children run off. at the corner, fresh bread is being delivered to a sidewalk cafe, as chairs are set out at tables by white aproned waiters who are preparing for their morning clientele. camera pulls back and up to reveal a taxi driver arguing with a deliver man as a husband kisses his wife goodbye and set off for work as we continue pulling back and across the city over montmartre, picking up an argument between two drivers here, fresh bread being delivered to a cafe over there. chairs are being set up at sidewalk tables as the city awakens and we float across montmartre into a small residential quarter. husbands kiss wives who send school children on their way as titles continue and the city comes more and more to life and we hover across a small square just up from the place de la opera, not far from the boulevard saint germain des pres, with montmartre in the b.g. the square has a sidewalk cafe with tables extending out onto a peninsula of pavement that stretches to the foot of a small hotel, whose shuttered windows overlook the square. as we pull back and back over the small square, we literally...}

<A>__{the first thing we see in this shot which should appear seamless in its one continuous motion transition from the preceding scene, is a spider web. we are tight on the web in which a still living insect struggles against his silky bonds. the web begins to tremble as from up above the spider drops, spinning thread lowering itself down on this latest victim, soon to be lunch. as the spider makes this journey we become aware in the b.g. of the panting sounds of lovemaking. it is a woman's breathless sighs and gasps we hear, but under that, perhaps a man's voice, perhaps not. the sounds build to a climax as the camera continues to pull back until it discovers the glistening body of a beautiful young parisian woman in post coital dewy nirvana. then, the figure of a nude man in silhouette enters frame and crosses over to the shuttered window. his face and body are half lit by the slats of light that penetrate from the world outside the hotel room. he lights a cigarette.}
