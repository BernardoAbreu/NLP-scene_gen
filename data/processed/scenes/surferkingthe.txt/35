<L>__{int day big mike's office}
<A>__{big mike is standing, walking around as he speaks, tiffany is sitting. clearly she is being scolded.}
<C>__{big mike}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{....why you wouldn't believe the things i've heard. just stupid things. cutting in line. demanding special treatment. oh, and how about this one:}
<P>__{(mimicking her)}
<D>__{princesses don't carry trash.}
<P>__{(back to his voice)}
<D>__{i've often thought it was a mistake to have you work here. maybe i was right.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(trying to dance out of it)}
<D>__{oh, daddy. you know how jealous people get.}
<C>__{big mike}
<D>__{i'd almost believe that. but i was behind the first aid station when you said the "princess" line. this park exists because the kids here work hard. they need to be treated fairly. they need to see you are just another lifeguard.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(protesting)}
<D>__{but i'm not just another lifeguard.}
<C>__{big mike}
<P>__{(mad again)}
<D>__{you won't even be that if this continues. if you want to keep coming here every day and driving that little convertible of yours, i need to see real, concrete changes in your attitude.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{all right. what do you expect me to do?}
<C>__{big mike}
<D>__{for one thing, start mingling with "the commoners". you'd be amazed at how nice some of the people who work here are. make some friends outside that little group of yours. it's the work of the average teenager here that puts food on our table. show some gratitude.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(thinking a moment)}
<D>__{fine. i will work it.}
<C>__{big mike}
<P>__{(softening, but firm)}
<D>__{good. work on it. please?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(nodding, but we don't believe her)}
<D>__{oh, daddy. don't worry about a thing.}
