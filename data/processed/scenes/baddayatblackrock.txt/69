<A>__{sweating with frustration. hector is six feet away, and armed too far away for doc to risk an attack with his lead pipe. doc looks around vaguely, wildly, for another weapon. a fraction of an inch from his nose is the hose wheel. for a split second he hesitates. then slowly, with infinite care, he tightens the heavy brass nozzle and begins to unwind the hose.}
