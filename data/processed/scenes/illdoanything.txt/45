<L>__{exterior beth's house day long shot}
<A>__{all three adults and jeannie sharing the burden of the luggage as they move towards the cab. mother and child hug. matt struck by his child's plight, him.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(turning to matt)}
<D>__{beginning now, you must give less value to your own happiness and well being, then hopefully, you will reach the point where you give that no value whatsoever. give her everything. there's no such thing as spoiling a child.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{even if you have to steal to do it?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{you don't really want to mess with me, do you?}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(simple honesty)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(to jeannie)}
<D>__{okay, sweetie. we have to go.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(to beth)}
<D>__{i want to go with you.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{can't, pretty heart. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{tears fall from jeannie's eyes.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{not even a compromise?}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{the compromise will be that you don't have to ride in back; you can ride up front with the driver... okay?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{as beth buckles jeannie into the front seat, matt gets in the back, alone, feeling preposterous. beth nods to the marshal, who surreptitiously handcuffs her.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(to driver)}
<D>__{can we please go?}
<A>__{shot jeannie the cab pulls away. matt leans towards her as she looks back at the receding figure of her mother and grows still.}
<B>__{on mother and marshall}
<A>__{as she sings him one last line of "don't talk to strangers."}
