<L>__{interior omura's office day}
<A>__{omura stands like an industrial titan before large picture windows offering a dramatic view of tokyo. the only decoration in the room is an enormous caravaggio.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{please, sit down, gentlemen.}
<A>__{omura removes a gold cigarette case and lights up. cigarettes are the newest western fad sweeping japan.}
<C>__{omura}
<P>__{(re: cigarette case)}
<D>__{a gift from czar alexander... captain algren,. it seems you have endured your captivity with little ill effect.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{he's an extraordinary man, isn't he?}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{he is samurai.}
<A>__{omura gazes at him. slowl y takes i puff from his cigarette.}
<C>__{ambassador swanbeck}
<D>__{mr. omura, my people have been drawing up the documents we discussed. i have a draft }
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{we're not quite ready to announce the treaty, ambassador.}
<C>__{ambassador swanbeck}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{the emperor is...sentimental. katsumoto was his old mentor he is not eager to offend him. it will take i few more days.}
<C>__{ambassj dor sw anbeck}
<D>__{how many da ys is " a few?"}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{i assure you the samurai will not stand in the wa y of our agreement. you are prepared to make deliver y?}
<C>__{ambassador swanbeck}
<D>__{soon as your emperor signs on the dotted line.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{captain algren you are the expert. will this array of ordnance be sufficient?}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{depends on what you're trying to accomplish.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{i want my country to take its place as a modern power.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{then they will set you well on your way.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{i am pleased.}
<C>__{amdassador sw anbeck}
<D>__{mr. omura, you assured us you had the influence with your emperor to make this deal come to pass. with all due respect perhaps there is someone else we should be speaking to.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{with all due respect, ambassador, perhaps there is someone else we should be speaking to, for instance the french. or the english. or any of the legations waiting in the next room.}
<A>__{ambassador swan beck stands swallowing his rage.}
<C>__{ambassador swanbeck}
<D>__{yes, we1l, we look forward to hearing from you.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{good afternoon, gentlemen.}
<A>__{they start to go.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{captain algren, perhaps you can stay a moment and tell me of your experiences in our rebellious provinces.}
<A>__{bagley looks at algren. do as he asks. he leaves a1gren alone with omura.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{cigarette?}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{omura lights his cigarette. a moment as he takes algren's measure.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{you fought bravely on behalf of our army against the rebel katsumoto.}
<A>__{algren says nothing. .}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{and yet you helped save his life when attacked by the ninja.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{my role was much less significant than you may have heard.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{tell me about your role in katsumoto's plans.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{i have none.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{and your sympathies?}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{again, i have none.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{i know you have little sympathy for colonel bagley.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{he is.... unsympathetic.}
<A>__{omura smiles.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{i thought it was we who are inscrutable.}
<A>__{now it is algren who smiles.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{you have gained important knowledge of katsumoto's province, his army, and his rebellion. this is extremely valuable to me.}
<A>__{he watches algren to see how this lands.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{you also possess significant knowledge of m y army, my weaponry, and my plans. this is extremely va1uable to katsumoto.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{again, you flatter me.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{no. i am a businessman. i recognize what is valuable. and i buy it.}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{in this case, i value your loyalt y.}
<A>__{algren considers the implications of what omura is saying.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{i didn't know loyalt y was something that could be sold.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{then perhaps you will give it, as a token of future friendship for which, as a friend, i would be in your debt.}
<C>__{algren}
<P>__{(stands)}
<D>__{then i will consider it.}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{and i will be grateful.}
