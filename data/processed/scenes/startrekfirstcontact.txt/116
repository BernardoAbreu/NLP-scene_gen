<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{close on cochrane's face a short time later. his head is bandaged, and he's conscious, but frankly he looks like hell. he sits back, looking a little overwhelmed.}
<C>__{cochrane}
<D>__{let me get this straight... you're from the future... i'm about to change history... and all i have to do is sit here and let you fly my ship?}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{picard, geordi and beverly are standing around cochrane, who is sitting in a high backed chair in a corner of the control room.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{he studies their faces sees they're serious. he smiles a little ruefully.}
<C>__{cochrane}
<D>__{and people say i'm crazy...}
<A>__{picard smiles.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i assure you, doctor, that after today... no one will ever call you that again.}
<A>__{cochrane considers them...finally nods, what the hell.}
<C>__{cochrane}
<D>__{just do me a favor... bring my ship back in one piece.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{that's a promise.}
<A>__{picard turns and walks off with beverly. geordi moves to cochrane with a little bit of awe.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{doctor... my name is geordi la forge. i'm an engineer. can i shake your hand?}
<A>__{cochrane is touched by geordi's obvious respect. they shake hands.}
<C>__{cochrane}
<D>__{i wish i could go with you. is there anything i can do to help?}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{not really... but i do have about a thousand questions i've always wanted to ask you.}
<C>__{cochrane}
<D>__{since time is short... why don't you pick the top ten and fire away?}
<A>__{geordi smiles...}
<B>__{picard and beverly}
<A>__{have moved to another part of the room. beverly looks exhausted. she sets her medkit on a table and plops down into a chair. mid conversation.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{you actually performed surgery...?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{it was an experience. metal scalpels... needle and thread...}
<A>__{she looks up with a smile, pulls a small device out of the medkit a surgical transporter.}
<C>__{beverly}
<P>__{(re: device)}
<D>__{but i had a little help. surgical transporter. i used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{how did doctor almack react to that?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{he was so confused by what i was doing, i don't think he even noticed.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{any word from the enterprise?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{not yet.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{you think they're still up there?}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(wry)}
<D>__{if they're not... we'd better get used to living in montana.}
<C>__{beverly}
<P>__{(light)}
<D>__{that might not be so bad... at least for you.}
<A>__{she's kidding, but picard is a little defensive.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<A>__{there is no animosity or hint of jealousy in beverly's attitude, she's simply making an observation about someone she cares about.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{i saw the way you looker at her... and i know that look.}
<A>__{picard doesn't want to argue about this to him, it's a pointless conversation.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{regardless of how i may feel about ruby... our fates lie along different paths. nothing can change that.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{you want some advice? don't do this again.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{you know exactly what i mean.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{beverly, there were many reasons why you and i...}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{i'd call them excuses. and the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." we convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. and you know what? it's not.}
<A>__{she holds his look for a moment.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(neutral)}
<D>__{i have a ship to launch.}
<A>__{picard turns and leaves. beverly watches him go... wondering whether her words had any affect...}
