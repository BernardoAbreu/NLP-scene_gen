<L>__{interior prison population day}
<A>__{a huge wall screen plays gentle nature scenes. below the inmates engage in their exercise hour. voisine stares at the screen while pollux carefully watches his "brother" play basketball. archer tosses up an air ball to the jeers of other inmates.}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{you realize, of course, that magnetic humming is designed to drive us insane. if we all don't get brain tumors first.}
<C>__{voisine}
<D>__{and that same cloying bambi tape over and over...}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{it's like they're begging us to riot. where the fuck are we, anyway?}
<P>__{(the game ends)}
<D>__{gotta go...}
<A>__{pollux trots over to archer passes him his cigarette. he studies archer as he takes a drag and nearly gags.}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{... i'm worried about you.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{your jumpshot has no arc. you used to swagger... now you swish. you're gumming that butt like a catholic school girl.}
<P>__{(notices)}
<D>__{and why do you keep picking at your finger?}
<A>__{pollux has caught archer reflexively tugging at his phantom wedding ring. archer immediately stops. he takes a drag and holds it then exhales right in pollux's face.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{i was in a coma...}
<A>__{pollux sticks his finger under archer's eye and pulls down like a vet examining a sick dog. archer pushes him off.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{my reflexes, my senses, my memory... everything's jumbled. i can't even tell you why dubov jumped me yesterday.}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{you pollinated his wife the day he was arrested. how could forget that?}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{i've forgotten plenty. look around we've screwed over half the freaks in here. what's gonna happen to us if they think i've lost it?}
<A>__{pollux contemplates the other inmates circling, sizing up the brothers like hungry sharks. instinctively, pollux moves closer to archer for protection.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{i need you to play big brother for once till i can fill in a few blanks. think you can handle that?}
<A>__{pollux nods grimly then archer pulls up his sleeve, exposing the pyramid tattoo.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{i know i got this on my tenth birthday. i just can't remember why.}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{man that was the worst day of our lives!}
<A>__{archer feigns a "struggle" with his memory. he lights a new butt with the old chain style... then "remembers."}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{oh, god mom o d'd at county general.}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass. you gave her mouth to mouth man even then you had some constitution.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{remember what you swore to me at the funeral?}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{uh to kill the doctors?}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{after that. you promised you'd always take care of me.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{and i bet i kept that promise...}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{only one you've never broken.}
<A>__{pollux curls into archer in need of comfort. archer puts an affectionate arm around pollux springing the trap.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{screw the past. we've got the future to look forward to.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{we still have tomorrow.}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{no shit... five million bucks... now those red militia crackpots get to keep it.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{that's not the worst part.}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{what's worse than losing five million bucks?}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{being stuck in this rat hole when it blows. what you built was a work of art. it belongs in the smithsonian.}
<A>__{pollux beams with pride archer hangs on every word.}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{yeah well... the l.a. convention center will have to do...}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{thanks, pollux.}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{'thanks'? i guess they really did fuck you up.}
<A>__{then archer smiles like jon archer. without knowing exactly why a wave of ill ease overtakes pollux.}
