<L>__{exterior gates to montreuil day}
<A>__{as the riders enter the walled town we see the poor clustered around the gates destitute and sick people clammering to get in.}
<C>__{beggars' chorus}
<D>__{at the end of the day you're another day older and that's all you can say for the life of the poor. it's a struggle! it's a war! and there's nothing that anyone's giving. one more day standing about what is it for? one day less to be living.}
<A>__{javert sees the destitution of the people. expressionless as ever.}
<C>__{beggars' chorus}
<D>__{at the end of the day you're another day colder and the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill. and the righteous hurry past they don't hear the little ones crying and the plague is coming on fast ready to kill one day nearer to dying!}
<A>__{track past a plague victim, wrapped in a shroud, being thrown onto a cart. the police enter the harbour.}
