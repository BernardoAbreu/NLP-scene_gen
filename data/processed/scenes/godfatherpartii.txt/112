<A>__{michael talks intimately to tom.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{there's a lot i can't tell you, tom. i know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence. but it is because i do trust you that i've kept so much secret from you. it's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that i can completely trust. in time, you'll understand everything.}
<C>__{hagen}
<P>__{(nods with this statement)}
<D>__{but your people... neri... rocco; you don't think...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no, i have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and tom, you are my brother.}
<A>__{hagen in very moved.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{mikey, i hoped...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no tom, just listen. all my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that. one thing i learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all. i've kept you out of things, tom, because i've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and i wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. i never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under sonny; i know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him. what i am saying is that now, for how long i do not know, you will be the don. if what i think has happened is true; i will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me. and even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary. i give you complete power: over neri... fredo, everyone. i am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.}
<B>__{view on hagen}
<A>__{a man who has steadily declined over the last five years, realizing that total power and responsibility is being placed on him.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...but tom, you must know that i do this only because i believe you are the only one who is capable of taking over for me.}
<B>__{view on michael}
<A>__{taking out the envelope.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i've prepared this; have had it for over a month. it won't explain everything; but indicates where i will be, so in a sense, it is my life.}
<P>__{(he hands the envelope to hagen)}
<D>__{also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately. pop would have given those to luca you knew pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him. it discusses kay as well; that will be the most difficult. the men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i don't think so. unless i'm very wrong...they're already dead. killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. that's why i am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{but if you're wrong...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{if i'm wrong...}
<A>__{there is a knock on the door.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{...i don't think i'm wrong.}
<P>__{(he indicates the knock)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the door opens; it is rocco; michael rises, after making a knowing glance toward tom, and moves to talk quietly to a frightened and agitated rocco.}
