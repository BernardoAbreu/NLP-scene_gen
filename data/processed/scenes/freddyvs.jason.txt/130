<D>__{you don't scare me, freddy! thanks to my various phases and many hours of watching violent televison, i have become immune to violence. seen it all and done it all! nothing you do can gross me out so why don't you give it your best shot, bitch!}

<D>__{i'm warning you, freddy... my father is a drill sergeant in the marine corps and he taught me just how to defend myself against slimy bastards like you.}

<D>__{oh i'm so scared, honey. come on! hit me! punch me right in the nose! i dare you!}
<A>__{freddy juts out his chin, gesturing for stormie to take a punch. stormie throws a right and pops freddy right in the nose.}

<P>__{(continuing; surprised)}
<D>__{owwwww!}
<A>__{stormie smiles but that soon fades as she realizes her fist is stuck in freddy's nose. freddy takes in a breath and stormie's arm is sucked up past the elbow. she screams. freddy takes a deep breath and snorts stormie right up his nose, her screams turning into a faint buzz. freddy smiles.}
