<C>__{stephenson}
<D>__{finn, one hour to porto corsa.}
<L>__{interior train moving later}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{thank you, stephenson.}
<A>__{finn watches as holley attaches a new emergency light on mater's roof. it looks exactly like his old one.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{that should just about do it.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{perfect.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{so mater, it's voice activated. but you know, everything's voice activated these days.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{what? i thought you was supposed to be making me a disguise.}
<C>__{mater's computer}
<D>__{voice recognized. disguise program initiated.}
<A>__{zwwwwat! a holographic disguise suddenly umbrellas out, emitted from mater's roof. it drops a clean cloaking image of the eastern european tow truck over mater.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{cool! hey, computer. make me a german truck!}
<C>__{mater's computer}
<D>__{request acknowledged.}
<A>__{zwatttt! mater suddenly wears lederhosen and a german hat.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{check it out. i'm wearing materhosen. make me a monster truck!}
<C>__{mater's computer}
<D>__{request acknowledged.}
<A>__{he's transformed into dracula, complete with fangs.}
<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(ala dracula)}
<D>__{i vant to siphon your gas. now make me a taco truck!}
<C>__{mater's computer}
<D>__{request acknowledged.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{a funny car!}
<C>__{mater's computer}
<D>__{request acknowledged.}
<A>__{finn suddenly pushes a button, stops the madness.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{the idea is to keep a low profile, mater.}
<A>__{mater, chastened, moves on.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{so i just go in, pretend to be this truck.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{and leave the rest to us.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{now hold still.}
<A>__{holley turns back to her work. the disguise's cloaking is larger than mater. as a result, holley must dial it back to fit his body. as she carefully calibrates the hologram:}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{i have to do the final fitting on your disguise.}
<A>__{holley stops. the 3d disguise is now flush with his frame, but dents show through.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{oh dear. that's no good.}
<A>__{she deploys a bondo sprayer on a robotic arm, moves it toward one of mater's dents. mater pulls away.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{hey, what are you doing?}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{the disguise won't calibrate effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{oh. for a second there i thought you was trying to fix my dents.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{i was.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{well then no thank you. i don't get them dents buffed, pulled, filled or painted by nobody. they're way too valuable.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{your dents are valuable?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{i come by each one of them with my best friend lightning mcqueen.}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{mater }
<D>__{i don't fix these. i want to remember these dents forever.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{so you were being serious in paris? mcqueen isn't just part of your cover?}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{friendships can be dangerous in our line of work, mater.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{but my line of work is towing and salvage.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{right. and miss shiftwell's is designing iphone apps.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{no, i meant for real. i }
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{it's okay. say no more. i will work around the dent.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{in the meantime...}
<A>__{finn hits a button. the walls transform into a massive}

<C>__{finn}
