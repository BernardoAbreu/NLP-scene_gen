<LOC>__{EXT. MOUNTAINS, NEAR GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The snow covered Alps stand out clearly in the light of a full moon.  A fortress-like CHATEAU is situated in a flat saddle of forest partway up the mountain, next to a frozen lake.  The property is surrounded by high stone walls, and the stately grounds are bathed in floodlights and patrolled by armed guards with dogs.}
<LOC>__{EXT. CHATEAU - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The driveway and motorcourt are filled with cars.  A formal- dress party is in progress... a private reception for a middle- eastern dignitary.  Tuxedoes men escort their diamond-encrusted ladies through the huge front doors, where they doff their overcoats and are politely scanned with hand-held metal detectors by white gloved security staffers. The walled perimeter of the house runs along the lake, forming a kind of rampart.  There is an opening, to a kind of waterway or canal, which connects to the private docks inside the grounds.  There is a steel grating across the opening.  The bars disappear down into the thin ice of early winter. With the house visible BG, we CRANE DOWN below the parapet wall along which a guard is a white exposure-suit is walking... down along the dark wall to the grating... TILTING DOWN to see a glow pulsing under the ice.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BENEATH THE ICE, UNDERWATER - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Camera moving toward:  A FIGURE in diving gear working at the metal bars with an oxygen arc cutting torch.  One bar has already been cut out.  Two quick cuts and a second bar falls to the muddy bottom.  Lit now only from the floodlights filtering down through the ice, the figure slips through the bars and swims powerfully along the stone canal wall. Seem from below, the figure is a black shadow moving against the rippled-glass of the ice above.}
<LOC>__{EXT. CANAL AND BOATHOUSE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A dock extends into the frozen canal, just behind a large boathouse.  There is a faint chipping sound.  The ice breaks quietly, and the pieces are slid back.  A head appears, in a rubber drysuit hood.  The DIVER slips the regulator out of his mouth and turns slowly, scanning...  revealing: HARRY TASKER.  Our hero.  Harry floats with just his eyes above the surface, silent as a water snake, as a guard passes on a footpath nearby. After a few beats Harry slips out of his tanks and fins, letting them sink, and climbs the frozen ladder onto the dock. He moves like a ninja into the shadows of the boathouse. Opening a WATERPROOF BAG, he pulls out a walky talky.}

<ACTION>__{Outside, FAST FAISIL, an Iranian-American, finishes making yellow snow and hurries back to the van.  They are parked on a winding mountain road a half-mile from the chateau, whose lights are visible through the trees. Faisil jumps in and goes to the eyepiece of a huge telephoto nightvision scope.  The eerie green image lurches as he sweeps the grounds, locating the boathouse.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Concealed in the shadows, Harry is shucking out of his drysuit. Underneath is he is wearing black tux pants, suspenders, cummerbund and a formal shirt.  He puts a tiny plug, like a hearing aid, deep in his ear canal.  A SUB-VOCAL TRANSCEIVER. Very advanced.}

He slips on a formal jacket, concealing the rig.  Then a final touch.  A little aftershave from a tiny plastic vial. Harry adjusts his bow-tie and strides confidently out of the shadows, crossing quickly to the main house.  He looks ultrasharp in his black tux with the white silk cummerbund and his hair slicked back.  He enters the main house through a back service entrance.}

<ACTION>__{Here the party is in full swing.  Harry blends smoothly into the crowd of foreign dignitaries, businessman and minor mid- east nobility.  They are a high-octane mixture of new oil money and old European money, and run the spectrum from stodgy bankers to playboy arms dealers. Harry strolls amiably among the glittering woman, the cigar smoking men, casually snagging a glass of champagne and a canape from the passing waiters.  He nods to someone as if he knows them.  Greets another is quite fluent Arabic.  People in his wake look at each other like "Do you know him?"   They shrug, go on with their conversation.  Harry moves through the crowd.  Scanning.}

<ACTION>__{HARRY'S POV - Through the crowd is sees JAMAL KHALED, the host of the party and owner of the chateau.  He is fat and animated, greeting guests with a flourish.  As Harry watches he warmly greets a beautiful WOMAN.  They become absorbed in a conversation. The woman glances up and sees Harry checking her out.  There is a frank moment of returned interest.

He sees two security guys moving purposefully through the crowd toward the stairs, walkies in their hands.

TWO DOBERMANS pelt toward Harry, leaping at him in perfect unison.  He waits... and knocks their heads together in mid- leap with a crack like a baseball bat.  The dogs drop to the snow, wobbling around like they're drunk. As Harry sprints on, ANOTHER DOBERMAN lunges out of the bushes ahead, leaping directly for his throat.  Harry grabs the dog and shot-puts him up into a tree without breaking stride.  Dog Fu.  The dog yelps and scrambles to hold onto an icy branch, looking down in amazement.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PERIMETER WALL/ MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Harry leaps down on the outside of the wall, hitting a snow bank and sliding downhill.  He sprints down the gentle slope toward the highway. Harry looks back as TWO GUARDS ON SKIS come out of a guard station beside the main entrance. TRACKING WITH THE SKI-GUARDS, searching through the trees with lights.  They have lost Harry.  They stop.  A snowbank behind them EXPLODES as Harry leaps out.  He disables them both with vicious street-fighter moves.  Harry looks upslope as-- A service gate opens in the perimeter wall and TEAMS OF SECURITY MEN in white snow-suits pour out, some on skis, some on SNOWMOBILES.  A HELICOPTER rises over the wall in a blast of swirling snow.  Its xenon lights rake through the trees, casting lurid wheeling shadows on the snow. ON Harry, snapping closed the ski boots he has stolen from one of the disabled guards.  He pops the boots quickly into the bindings and takes off downhill with one of the guard's FN FAL rifles slung across his back. The helicopter swoops downhill, its searchlight blazing through the forest.  Snowmobile headlights illuminate the ski-patrols zig-zagging among the trees. Harry slashes expertly downhill.  He cuts a distinguished figure in his black tux.  Automatic weapons fire rips through the trees from behind him.  Harry is going flat-out.  The xenon light hits him.  A 7.62 mm machine gun in the chopper rips the slope into white clouds around him.  Harry slashes, turns, weaving among the trees at breakneck speed.  A snowmobile is closing in, outflanking him.  He turns toward it, suddenly. Hits a mogul.  Uses the air to slash his skis right across the rider's face.  The snowmobile crashes and tumbles into the night.}

<ACTION>__{Harry sees the chopper start an attack run.  He comes out into the open, going straight downhill like a rocket.  The chopper gets suckered in...  trying to hit him, getting right down behind him... and suddenly-- Harry slides to a stop in an explosion of powder and whips up the rifle.  P-P-P-POW!  He rakes a burst across the windshield.  The startled pilot swerves and-- Suddenly two tall pine trees are right in front of him. K-WHACK!  The main-rotor blade snaps clean off and the chopper drops into the snow, plowing into a snowbank.  It slides right to the edge of a steep ridge and stops, teetering. Firing from a snowmobile, one of the guards puts a burst right across Harry's path.  Harry's skis are hit and he tumbles, comes out of it...  running down the hill like a juggernaut in his heavy boots.  He has lost the rifle somewhere in the snow. Harry takes cover behind the burning wreck of the downed chopper, which still has its engine running.  The ski patrol opens fire from upslope.  Rounds whacking against the disabled helicopter. Harry looks down the slope and gets an idea.  He jerks the unconscious pilot out and pushes on the fuselage, rocking it. It slips over the edge.  He leaps inside as it topples forward and slides down the slope.}

It drops onto the road ten feet in front of the skidding van...  then slides over the edge and tumbles into a rocky canyon where is BLOWS UP!  The fireball lights up the night.

He knocks away the SILENCED PISTOL aimed at the back of his head with a sweeping block, capturing Yusif's arm in an arm-lock.  The shot goes wide, shattering a urinal. Harry slams his palm into Yusif's face like a piledriver, and spins him against the steel stalls.  The silenced pistol goes skittering across the floor. Mahmoud whips a pistol out of his waistband.  Still holding the bear-like Yusif, Harry draws his Glock so fast we can barely see him move.  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  Three .45 slugs  go through Mahmoud's chest, shattering the mirror behind him.

Yusif reaches for it, but Harry kicks it under the stalls. He punches Yusif in the face, driving him back.  They grapple, spinning.  Harry drives Yusif's head into the counter.  Then he elbows him in the throat and they crash together on the filthy floor.  Harry grabs Yusif's hair and pounds his face repeatedly against the rim of a urinal.
