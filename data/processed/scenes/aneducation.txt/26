<A>__{we see the bristol parked outside, and jenny walking towards it, a small figure in a large playground. she's clearly just changed out of her school uniform, and she's making last minute adjustments to her civvies. a teacher walks towards her, and jenny almost freezes but the teacher merely smiles pleasantly and walks past. jenny keeps walking at a measured pace for a moment and then breaks into a run.}
