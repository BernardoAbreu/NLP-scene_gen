<A>__{inside the hut ada had lifted the top of the piano and is peering in while playing notes to check tune and damage.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{is it all right? aren't you going to play something?}
<A>__{ada pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. she rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where stewart waits crossed armed. quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures flora to play. flora proudly takes p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and stewart.}
<C>__{flora}
<A>__{what will i play? she looks to ada, who looks back through her not concentrating.}
<C>__{stewart}
<A>__{play a gig.}
<C>__{flora}
<A>__{(to ada) do i know any gigs?}
<C>__{stewart}
<A>__{play a song then flora starts a song, ada walks past them out of the hut, stewart ignores her exit moving up to lean on the piano. ada is seen through the hut window wandering amidst the ghostly, blackened trunks. stewart's attention is drawn to ada, he interrupts flora's singing with a sudden outburst.}
<C>__{stewart}
<A>__{(exasperated) why won't she play it? we have it back, and she just wanders off! flora stops to watch her mother through the window. ada looks towards the house as the music stops.}
<C>__{stewart}
<A>__{keep playing! grimly stewart slaps the top of the piano to flora's playing. ada continues to walk, her face dark and puzzled. she stops. her head stiffly, irresistibly, lifts and turns in the direction baines' hut. she peers deep into the bush as if attempting to penetrate a puzzle. she thinks and walks on. sc 88 interior stewart's kitchen day sc 88 the next day ada and her piano face each other across the kitchen. a slit of light falls across the piano highlighting it's rosey walnut wood. ada's expression is critical and distant. taking a cloth she begins to clean and polish the piano. her finger holds down one of the keys and we glimpse an old inscription on its side, a small heart, and an arrow. putting the cloth aside she sits at the piano to begin playing. she starts with wholehearted feeling, her eyes closed, but before long she is surprised by a moving reflection across the piano and she 'starts', glancing over her shoulder. she stops and begins again. but once more a reflex has her glance across her left shoulder and she pauses in her playing. disquieted she starts again and again she looks away. she stops, confused, unable to go on, unable to getup, one hand on the lid and one on the piano keys. sc 89 exterior path to baines' day sc 89 ada carrying her cape and bonnet hurries through the narrow bush path to baines' hut, flora has a fist of her skirt and is pulling back. ada turns on flora and snatches the skirt out of the girl's hand. ada signs to her and continues on.}
<C>__{flora}
<A>__{why? why can't i? ada signs again.}
<C>__{flora}
<A>__{(crossing her arms) i shan't practise and i don't care! but ada does not wait to listen. flora walks back through the bush muttering childish expletives to herself. stewart and his two maori helpers come out of the bush towards her. flora squeals with fright.}
<C>__{stewart}
<A>__{(looking up the hill) where's your mother? where has she gone? flora pauses petulant and grumpy.}
<C>__{flora}
<D>__{to hell!}
<A>__{flora races off as fast as she can, enlivened by her wickedness. stewart clambers back up the path. he just glimpses the distant figure of ada nervously turning, her skirts flying as she hurries up the bush path the wind bothers the tops of the trees, setting them groaning, rubbing their branches against each other. sc 90 interior baines' hut day sc 90 ada enters baines' hut, she is breathless1 announcing her presence by simply being there, standing there. baines comes through from the bedroom. seeing ada he is aloof, suspicious and his blinking becomes pronounced.}
<C>__{baines}
<D>__{so what brings you here? did you leave something? i have not found anything.}
<A>__{ada does not respond, finally she looks at baines and her look has a vulnerability and frankness that takes him off guard.}
<D>__{does he know something?}
<A>__{ada shakes her head.}
<D>__{the piano is not harmed? it arrived safely? would you like to sit? i am going to sit.}
<A>__{ada does not sit. she stands immobilised. baines attempts to maintain his casual charade) he pours a tea. he turns to her about to speak, but stops unmanned by a new fragility to her strength. he blinks rapidly}
<C>__{baines}
<D>__{ada, i am unhappy because i want you, because my mind has seized on you and thinks of nothing else. this is how i suffer, i am sick with longing. i don't eat, i don't sleep. if you do not want me, if you have come with no feeling for me, then go!}
<A>__{baines walks roughly towards the door and opens it, his softness turned suddenly cruel.}
<D>__{go! go now! leave!}
<A>__{ada is stung by his change of tune, she takes a step towards him and eyes filling with tears of anger hits him hard across the face. baines' nose begins to bleed yet his face slowly lights up as if she has spoken words of love. ada is flushed, shocked, the two face each other at this very moment of profound awareness of each other, profoundly equal. with each new breath, with every moment that their eyes remained locked together the promise of intimacy is confirmed and reconfirmed and detailed until like sleepwalkers who do not know how they came to wake where they did, they are standing next to each other and beginning to kiss each other, the lips, the cheeks, the nose. there is nothing practised about their tenderness, only their feelings and emotions guide their instincts. baines' face crumples with the exquisite pain of his pleasure, ada cradles his head to her chest. baines struggles through her dress anxious to touch her skin. sc 91 ext int baines' hut day sc 91 outside stewart surveys the hut suspiciously. baines' dog growls as he climbs on to the small verandah. carefully stewart peers through some loosely slatted boards. there are sounds inside which are worrying him. by standing on the seat he has found a spyhole where he can see ada and baines kissing, undressing he reels back angry, but just as we might expect him to burst through, he steps up to look again; the fatal second look, the look for curiosity. he watches baines bare chested undressing ada, her buttons burst, ada laughs, baines touches her under her skirts anywhere, he takes himself under her dress pulling down her stockings. stewart watches, stepping down to peer lower as baines buries into ada's skirt. he does not seem to notice the dog licking his hand. suddenly he pulls his hand away and looks at it, wet with dog saliva, he wipes it on the boards and continues watching as if mesmerised. sc 92 interior baines' bedroom day sc 92 inside baines' small bedroom the raw dark boards contrast with the softness, whiteness of baines' and ada's bodies, the long black strands of ada's hair stick to her cheek and wrap around her neck. her face is flushed and her eyes are bright. baines rolls his face across her chest, gently, slowly savouring the flavour of her body. drunkenly they continue their sex slowly, slowly. ada's breaths turn to low murmurs; these small sounds are extraordinarily moving to baines whose face swoons with joy.}
<C>__{baines}
<D>__{what? what? whisper....}
<A>__{sc 93 interior baines' bedroom&under housedaysc 93 as ada dresses, baines sits on his bed watching. he is unhappy, thoughtful.}
<C>__{baines}
<D>__{now you are going i am miserable, why is that? (he catches her hand and draws her to hint) ada i need to know, what will you do? will you come again?}
<A>__{ada is distracted, collecting her buttons from the floor, concerned at the time past, worried to dress and return. the camera cranes down and down to find stewart wedged under the loose wooden floor slats. he cannot hear clearly, but ada's hand reaching for each button is only inches away. one falls through a slat on to stewart's neck and on down his shirt collar. as she stands he rolls out.}
<C>__{baines}
<D>__{wait! i don't know what you're}
<P>__{thinking. (gently, teasingly)}
<D>__{does this mean something to you? hey? (stroking a strand of hair behind her ear) i already miss you. ada, do you love me?}
<A>__{ada considers this question. clearly she doesn't know, the question is more complex to her than to him, then as if by way of answer she kisses him strongly and sexually. baines pulls away confused. ada finishes dressing. baines comes up behind her to help with the buttons.}
<C>__{baines}
<P>__{(anxiously) come tomorrow. if}
<D>__{you are serious, come tomorrow.}
<A>__{ada turns and kisses him passionately, with the new born enthusiasm of someone who has just discovered their appetite for sex. then as quickly as she began, she takes her hood and cape and goes to leave.}
<C>__{baines}
<D>__{tomorrow?}
<A>__{she nods and is gone. sc 94 interior stewart's hut ada's bedroomnightsc 94 flora and ada are both in their white nightgowns. flora stands behind ada on a chair trying to sort out the knots that have matted at the back of ada's head. ada shakes her head from side to side playfully, making the difficult job impossible.}
<C>__{flora}
<D>__{stay still! it's the very worst knots.}
<A>__{flora tries to hold her mother's head still but ada's high spirits are unstoppable and her hair flies out from side to side flicking flora in the face.}

<D>__{mama stop it!}
<A>__{flora starts to giggle and retaliates flinging her own hair from side to side. the two women are twirling in the small bedroom their hair flying about them, flora is shrieking with the fun, then stops dizzy and sick. ada continues flicking flora as she twirls.}

<D>__{stop it i feel sick!}
<A>__{but ada doesn't stop, her dark hair whirls about her, as giddy and disorientated, she knocks against the walls sc 95 interior stewart's hut night sc 95 next door stewart sits on his bed listening, his hair wet and neatly combed. he has a journal of pressed botanical specimens beside him. hearing flora squealing he goes to the kitchen and standing back in the shadows, watches ada frenetic, whirling through the part open door.}
