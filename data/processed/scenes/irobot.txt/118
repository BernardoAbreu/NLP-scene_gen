<A>__{the sound of his agonised scream. follows us back into the present. spooner. clenching. his artificial arm.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{the robot pulled me out of the wreck. but left my arm behind.}
<P>__{(holds up arm)}
<D>__{i woke up four weeks later with this.}
<A>__{calvin. taking in the story.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{and that's why robots terrify you?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{let's just say they make me uncomfortable.}
<P>__{(pulls out pills)}
<D>__{i take these if i get too uncomfortable. doesn't exactly lend me a lot of credibility on the force.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{but it doesn't mean you're wrong about this case.}
<A>__{calvin. sits down on the couch. pulling her hands through her hair.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i don't believe sonny did it either.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i think about what hogenmiller must have wanted. robots with the same cognitive and emotional abilities as humans. but not just simulations. i don't know. when i was talking to sonny i was forced to put away all the things i've ever known the three laws, the rules of programming, basic science and engineering.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sonny's the most advanced robot i've ever encountered, detective. it's almost as if...he cared for dr. hogenmiller. i just don't believe he's capable of murder.}
<A>__{spooner. looking down at her. can hardly believe it.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{you mean the great dr. calvin is basing all this on a feeling?}
<A>__{calvin. smiling ironically.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{that and the fact that robertson didn't want me interviewing sonny for any more than five minutes.}
<A>__{spooner. suddenly rejuvenated by having an ally. strides over to his coat. pulling out the metal nameplate:}

<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{ever seen this before?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{i found it at hogenmiller's house. right before the demolition crew tried to make me part of the foundation.}
