<A>__{salvatore is driving an old beaten up balilla he bought from a car wrecker. elena sits beside him, having the time of her life. they roar with laughter. the car jolts, moves by fits and starts, jarred by the holes in the road, and besides salvatore is not such a hot driver. she fondles him.}
<C>__{elena}
<P>__{(ironically)}
<D>__{you have a great future as a driver. if they don't arrest you first!!}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{that's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...}
<A>__{he has barely finished the last sentence when the car gives a sudden violent shudder. a sharp report. a cloud of white smoke issues from the motor. and the balilla stops dead in its tracks. elena and salvatore cannot smother their wild laughter. they embrace.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{so now how do we get home? cut to:}
<A>__{the two of them are standing beside the empty road, looking bored, as they have already been waiting a long time for someone to go by, a car, a wagon. when all at once a car comes around the bend, heading for town. salvatore and elena flag it down. the driver slows down. the back door opens, a man gets out. an alarmed and startled look comes over elena's face that man is her father. she sees him stride over in a rage. he has almost reached salvatore, who tries lo be polite, to make the best of the situation.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{hello, dr mendola...hem...}
<A>__{elena buries her face in her hands, so as not to see...}
<C>__{interior cinema paradiso evening}
<A>__{salvatore has a bruise on his cheek and two band aids on his face. he got himself a good thrashing, and then some. the house is jammed, as on the great occasions. curiosity is written all over the faces of the audience. but what they're seeing is not a film, but an instalment of double or nothing. salvatore is standing by a teleprojector which has been set up in the central aisle of the balcony. it is a machine that makes it possible to project television show on the screen. alfredo is sitting beside him.}
<C>__{alfredo}
<P>__{(in a low voice)}
<D>__{toto, are you pulling my leg or something? how is it possible to see this television without film?}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{just so, alfredo. there isn't any. and if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...}
<C>__{alfredo}
<P>__{(sceptically)}
<D>__{could be...but i don't like this business. it smells fishy to me.}
<A>__{elena is sitting in one corner of the balcony with her parents. sitting beside her father is the owner of the movie house, spaccafico, who thanks him.}
<C>__{spaccafico}
<P>__{(in a low voice)}
<D>__{you see what a bright idea, dr mendola? but without the bank loan how could i have bought the machine? if we don't get organized around here, in this day and age, we'll meet the same end as the punch and judy shows!}
<A>__{elena is not very interested in the tv show. she sneaks a look at salvatore. from the looks on their faces, it is clear that things are not going very well. he gives her a nod, as if to say he wants to speak to her and that she should figure out some way! elena leans over to her mother, whispers something into her ear.}
<C>__{toilet. cinema paradiso interior evening}
<A>__{elena's mother stands waiting in front of the women's toilet, gazing at mike bongiorno emceeing the tv show in the distance. inside the toilet, elena is standing on the toilet seat whispering to salvatore, who is standing on the 20ilet seat of the men's toilet. their eyes are barely able to peek over the flush tank which they have uncovered. elena is worried.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{could it be your father doesn't like the work i do...that my family's too poor...is that it?}
<A>__{she gives a nod of the head, but only faintly, so as no2 to wound his vulnerability. salvatore sighs.}

<D>__{for the moment it's impossible to see each other...as soon as school is out, we're going to go stay with friends in tuscany. we'll be there all summer...maybe if you came up, we could meet in secret...}
<C>__{salvatore}
<P>__{(crestfallen)}
<D>__{but we're opening the outdoor movie theatre this summer. what will i do all this time without seeing you?!}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{i will write to you every day. don't worry. i love you. the summer'll be over and i will be back...}

<D>__{elena!}
<A>__{elena climbs down, pulls the chain and walks off, leaving salvatore standing there on the toilet seat. summer has come. a bevy of barefoot children chase after the carts carrying the carters' families to the beach to go swimming. salvatore, helped by the usher, has finished loading the disassembled projector on to a wagon in order to carry it to the outdoor movie house. the usher has hung a sign on the cinema paradiso to the effect that 'showings to continue at the imperia arena', and now climbs into the wagon. the horse moves off slowly and the monotonous clatter of its hoofs reminds salvatore that the summer is going to be long this year, longer than ever. and he leans on the projector that totters and lurches from the jolting of the wheels. a cart carrying a cheerful and noisy family pulls up alongside the wagon. there are the men from the slaughter house. they recognize salvatore.}
<D>__{slaughter house man well, look who's here!! cecil b. de mille! hey, toto!! when are you coming to shoot another film?!?}
<A>__{and they laugh, with their gaping toothless mouths. salvatore doesn't feel like joking, not even like answering. he looks away, so as not to see their leers. he wants to be by himself.}
<C>__{exterior beach and imperia arena day}
<A>__{the beach is almost deserted, dotted here and there with groups of bathers. the carts and horses are scattered in the sand, near the imperia arena, where some workmen are putting on the finishing touches for the new opening. the wagon arrives and salvatore and the usher unload the projector.}

<A>__{a sultry evening. the jacklights of the octopus fishers twinkle on the dark horizon. the sound track of a comic film reverberates over the sea, the laughter of the audience mingles with the sound of the shallow waves breaking on the rocks. a group of little boys in a boat pulls away from shore. they join some more boats standing still in the water, all of them crammed with little boys all looking in the same direction... towards the screen of the open air movie at the water's edge. there is a funny scene.}
<C>__{little boys}
<D>__{all seats are sold out! free entrance and payment on the way out!! sssssh!!}
<A>__{and they guffaw noisily. their laughter is echoed by more laughter, in the distance... ...the laughter of the arena audience, scattered among the metal chairs. by dint of laughing, the people in one of the rows of chairs tip over backwards. screams, laughs, whistles. the projection booth has a door at the back with stairs leading down to the rocks. salvatore is sitting on the ground, bare chested, tired and sticky with sweat. he is reading a letter from elena. he is so engrossed the words can almost be read on his face.}
<C>__{elena's voice}
<P>__{(off screen)}
<D>__{salvatore, my darling, here the days never end. i find your name everywhere if i read a book, do a crossword puzzle, thumb through a newspaper...you're always before my eyes. today i've got some rather bad news. at the end of october we're moving to the city where i will attend the university. it'll be hard to see each other every day. but don't worry, whenever i can get away i will always come running to you, to the cinema paradiso.}
<A>__{on the arena screen, with its potted plants and palm trees, a very funny scene is being shown. the audience again bursts into wild laughter. and the audience of little boys in the boats also laugh. one of them, laughing himself to tears, loses his balance and falls into the water. the others howl with laughter. a voice rises up out of the carousel of boats.}

<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{elena...elena...elena...}
<A>__{now he is sitting outside on the back steps, a few yards from the sea. there is a breeze this evening, the waves are rather high and the boats of 'gate crashers' can be seen out in the water, rolling fitfully but not dangerously. salvatore stretches out, gazes up at the inky sky and talks to himself, just like a madman, whispering...}

<A>__{a clap of thunder explodes in the air. loud, rumbling. salvatore's eyes pop open. the arena audience looks up in alarm at the sky...the 'gate crashers' in the boats also look up and see a streak of lightning ushering in another clap of thunder. one of those storms is building up that ruins late summer nights. salvatore gives a contented smile as the cloudburst pours down violently, suddenly... the arena audience scatters with a howl and scurries over to the overhanging roofs of the projection booth, to take shelter and to go on watching the film despite the rain... the little boys in the boats quickly pull tarpaulins over their heads...but salvatore does not get up. he lets the rain fall on him, goes on laughing, incredulous and stunned as if a real miracle had taken place. and as he shuts his eyes and lifts his head up, to catch more rain on his face, and gives himself up to that marvellous feeling of joy, a mouth comes to rest passionately on his lips it is elena. salvatore opens his eyes in utter amazement, it seems like a vision, another hallucination created by the rain...instead no, it is really her!}

<D>__{elena!...but when...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{i got back today. you can't imagine the excuses i had to make up to be here...}
<A>__{salvatore's lips interrupt her. it is an intense, a stupendous kiss. they've probably never been so happy as they are at that moment. they cling to each other as the rain goes on streaming over their bodies, mingling her hair with his, binding them ever closer.}
