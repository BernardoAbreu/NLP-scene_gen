<A>__{jacob crashes into it. a light suddenly goes on. jezebel "jezzie" pipkin, 33, is standing in the bedroom door tying a man's terrycloth bathrobe around her waist. although sleepy, disheveled, and not looking her best, it is obvious that jezzie is a beefy woman, juicy and sensual.}

<P>__{bathroom)}
<D>__{don't ask.}
<A>__{jacob steps into the bathroom and pulls at his clothes, leaving them in a pile on the floor. he reaches for the faucet and sends a stream of water pouding against the porcelain tub. jezzie enjoys jacob's nakedness. she reaches out to his chest and squeezes one of his nipples. his body tenses slightly. jezzie drops her robe. they enter the shower together.}
