<A>__{he comes to a ballroom empty, like everything else; shiny hardwood floor for dancing. a spotlight pops on from above, illuminating ken castle. he's wearing a t shirt and jeans. every instinct tells kable to go after him but he holds back. who knows if it's even real? and then castle starts to sing... ... or more precisely, lip sync the voice is sinatra, i've got you under my skin... castle is doing a spot on karaoke: i've got you under my skin i've got you deep in the heart of me so deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me i've got you under my skin... he's snapping his fingers, putting on the moves... then from behind curtains a half dozen slayers appear. we recognize the scarred, battle tough faces from the prison, the game, the pursuit... only instead of blue, they are wearing tuxedoes with blue bow ties. kable grips his weapon, but the men are unarmed; instead, they fall in on the beat and go into a choreographed dance behind castle... i'd sacrifice anything come what might for the sake of having you near in spite of a warning voice that comes in the night and repeats, and repeats in my ear... kable notices shadowy figures around the perimeter of the room... glasses, beards, pony tails silently, the geek squad has moved in and taken position. they move their hands in rhythm, synchronized... each one seems to control a dancer: they twirl a finger and the slayer spins... kick with two fingers for legs and the slayer kicks like a}

<A>__{suddenly, on a musical hit, everyone castle, the geeks, the slayers points dramatically up at the wall, where a video screen begins to play: it is footage of the geek squad busting into humanz headquarters and efficiently killing everyone. angie is tasered unconscious and dragged away. don't you know, little fool, you never can win? use your mentality, wake up to reality... but each time i do just the thought of you makes me stop before i give in cause i've got you, under my skin... kable hits his breaking pointerior he brings up his weapon to open up on the slayers... click. it's dead. the geeks have taken care of that. kable tosses it aside and sprints for castle, but the slayers break off from the choreography to engage him; turns out they're flesh and blood after all. castle backs away, whistling the melody, and continues his softshoe to the music as kable wades into brutal hand to hand combat... breaking necks, snapping arms, smashing faces... it's a full on ballet of death... finally, the music ends, right on cue: kable is finishing off the last of the men, blood on his hands. castle applauds; the geeks follow suit.}
