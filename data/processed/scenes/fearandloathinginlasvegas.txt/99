<D>__{there is a definite obligation, when you boom around vegas in a white coupe de ville, to maintain a certain style.}
<A>__{duke and gonzo burst out of the supermarket riding a shopping basket loaded with coconuts, grapefruit and tequila. they send defeated shoppers sprawling. the trolley collides into the white whale. shoppers gather at the supermarket entrance to watch baskets loaded with junk, screaming kids and empty wallets. duke switches on the music: jumping jack flash. he selects a coconut ceremonially balances it on the hood. gonzo pulls out a silver claw hammer. a sly look at the gathering crowd... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut! a gasp from the surly shoppers. duke places another coconut. smash! milk and white meat flies everywhere.}
<D>__{shopper #1 hey! is that your car?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{sure is.}
