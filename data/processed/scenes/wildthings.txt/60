<L>__{interior camp store same}
<A>__{it's dark inside. the main light source is a tiny, beat up black and white tv. two elderly women in colored bouffant hairdos sit on a ratty old couch watching reruns of "family feud." they look up as ray and gloria enter then exit through a door in the back.}
<L>__{interior suzie's room same}
<A>__{black walls. cheap bookshelves, filled to overflowing. a wire strung with dismembered doll parts runs the length of the room. suzie is propped on a ratty futon, an open book on her stomach, her thin, white arms crossed behind her head.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{jesus. it took you long enough. what if somebody was trying to strangle me? or fuck me in the ass, even?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i mean, you guys are sex crimes.}
<A>__{ray manages a thin smile.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{meet my partner, gloria perez.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{i did. at blue balls.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{seems to me you left early, before we could meet. but hi, suzie.}
<A>__{gloria puts out a hand. suzie looks at it, puts out a hand of her own. as the women shake, gloria looks at the book on suzie's stomach, turning her head as if to read the title.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{it's celine. he's okay. he had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{so suzie, you called us, remember?}
<A>__{suzie takes a cigarette from a pack at her side, lights up, blows smoke at the ceiling.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{did they arrest mr. lombardo?}
<A>__{ray and gloria exchange looks.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{will they?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it doesn't look like it.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{then he'll be back at blue balls?}
<A>__{ray shrugs.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{that bothers you?}
<C>__{suzie}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{yeah, maybe, a little.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{why is that?}
<A>__{suzie lets out her breath. she rests her head against the wall.}
<C>__{gloria }
<D>__{you can talk to us, suzie. that's why we're here...}
