<A>__{athos helps the man in the iron mask onto the bed; the eyes behind the slits in the mask are darting, frightened.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{are you hungry?}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{just... water.}
<A>__{athos pours a cupful from the water pitcher on the bed table; but when he tries to help the prisoner drink the liquid spills as the cup bumps the mouth hole.}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{this way.}
<A>__{the prisoner manipulates the cup in the way he must to get a drink, then falls back to the pillow.}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{this place... i once lived in a country house. i had guardians an old man and woman. and tutors. but no friends. then when i was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{who came?}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{a man in black. i never saw his face. he took me to the cell. a blacksmith came and they put me into the mask. for days i shouted, "what have i done? why do you do this to me?" but no one heard, so i just stopped shouting.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{and you never knew why?}
<C>__{prisoner}
<D>__{i thought... there is something about my face that men do not want to see. something that makes them cruel. but then i realized they were cruel even when i was wearing the mask. i knew there must be some other reason, but i could not think what it was.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{what is your name?}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{the old man and woman called me... phillippe.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{phillippe. rest now.}
<A>__{athos moves to the door.}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{thank you... for your kindness.}
<A>__{athos nods, pauses a moment... and leaves.}
