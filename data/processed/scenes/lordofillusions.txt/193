<L>__{interior nix's house sanctum night}
<A>__{on butterfield, as nix removes his foot. butterfield is out for the count. on nix, as he stops screaming. his face is grotesquely disfigured by the mask, the flesh stained and corrupted. the screaming of the cultists is dying away.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{children...}
<L>__{interior nix's house passageway night}
<A>__{the cultists all face the sanctum door, awaiting instruction.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{will you suffer to come unto me?}
<A>__{one by one, the cultists fall to their knees. we never see flesh pierced by broken glass. but we hear it, and see the agony on the cultist's faces. they start to sob. then, nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{i've come back to share the wisdom of the grave. will you hear it?}
<C>__{cultists}
<D>__{yes... yes...}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{follow me then.}
<A>__{he steps out of the doorway. the cultists let out sobs of adoration. nix locks at dorothea.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{do i know you, child?}
<A>__{he reaches for her. pulls her close to his body. dorothea keeps her self possession; but only just.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{oh yes... i do, don't i? no gun this time, child?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{where's swann?}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{i don't know where he is.}
<A>__{nix picks her up, so that her feet are inches off the ground.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{he'll come. we've got unfinished business, he and i.}
<A>__{then he carries her down the passageway to the meditation room, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the wounds he's receiving. the cultists follow.}
