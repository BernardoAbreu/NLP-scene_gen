<L>__{exterior howrah station (calcutta) day (early morning)}
<A>__{a huge bridge dominates the skyline. the train trundles to a stop, its whistle clearing the way. people hang on its sides, sit on the roof... and now flood the platform, flowing into the station, clearing a view for us of the pals, clinging to their baggage in the middle of this human anthill. close on them (moving) hands reach out with sweets to sell, with tea, asking for money.}
<C>__{manooj}
<D>__{daddy, i'm scared.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{scared? no why? this is very exciting. as soon as we get to our friend's house, everything will be fine.}
<A>__{but, despite hasari's charade of confidence, they (and we) are overwhelmed by the size of the station and the desperate energy of the humanity around them. as they press on, a small beggar woman huddled on the platform turns her eyes eerily on manooj... as a deformed hand stretches into the frame. aloka senses someone: a beggar, face half hidden and eaten away by leprosy. this terrifying image presses the boys tightly to their mother and moves hasari to encircle armita with one hand and attempt to wrap the other three inside the embrace of his other hand. it does not seem possible that he can protect all of them against the predatory eyes watching them. he moves them quickly to a wall...}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{wait right here. don't move.}
<B>__{with hasari}
<A>__{he moves to a line of vendors, shows a piece of paper to one, as he digs out his precious screw of money to make a purchase of sweets from the vendor.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{please, can you direct me to my friend at this address? we are to stay with him.}
<A>__{the vendor gives the address a look, shows it to the vendor next to him. both look at hasari.}
<D>__{vendor #1 there's no such address as this in calcutta.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{but that's not possible. vendor #1 of course it is possible! i have lived here all my life. you are new. who would know if a place exists or does not? vendor #2 bombay, perhaps. delhi. look there.}
<A>__{dear god, what now? stunned, hasari hands vendor #1 a rupee and, with the sweets, turns back to his family, his face going through a magical transformation as he prepares to suggest to the family that all is well.}
