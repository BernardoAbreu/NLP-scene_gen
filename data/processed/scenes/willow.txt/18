<L>__{exterior nelwyn village day}
<A>__{the raucous band plays as nelwyns dance and celebrate amid brochs and wheelhouses garlanded with flowers. a crowd cheers wildly as miners battle farmers in a tug of war, finally yanking the farmers face first into a puddle of mud. on a stage a harlequin dances delight fully. while on a raised platform the five members of the village council sit and observe, mildly amused. the head councilman is burglekutt. the we see willow on another stage. he flourishes his colorful sticks and cloths. in the audience we notice his friend meegosh, who wears a miner's apron, rooting willow on.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{and now! for our final amazing bit of magic, i will make an entire pig completely disappear!}
<A>__{meegosh applauds as mims and ranon trot out lugging a tiny baby pig in a crate. as willow takes the pig out it bites his hand and gets away. willow tackles and squashes it. the crowd laughs and half of them leave, and meegosh covers his face. mims and ranon rapidly wave a bright blanket. willow cleverly whips the pig under his legs and behind his back and suddenly it's gone! impresse, the crowd gasps. then the pig squeals and dashes through willow's legs and leaps off the stage.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{aaww! booo! sssss!}
<A>__{burglekutt and the council shake their heads as willow, embarassed, picks up his things. meegosh trots up with the pig under his arm.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{meegosh, i'm in trouble.}
<C>__{meegosh}
<D>__{hey, it wasn't that bad. you need a better pig, that's all.}
<A>__{but as they walk past the village council, and bur glekutt sneers down at willow, meegosh catches on.}
<C>__{meegosh}
<D>__{now burglekutt's got you in the squeeze. soon you'll be down in the mines like me.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{mining. i hate closed in spaces. that's the last thing i'd ever do.}
<P>__{(he shudders)}
<D>__{i gotta get my crop planted.}
<C>__{meegosh}
<D>__{you know i will help you as much as i can, willow.}
<A>__{the village council members stand up respectfully as the wise old high aldwin hobbles through the adoring crowd. mims and ranon rush up to willow with several other children who are eating candy.}
<C>__{mims}
<D>__{dada, can we get treacle candy? can we, can we? please?}
<C>__{willow}
<P>__{(preoccupied)}
<D>__{meegosh, can you watch the chil dren? i gotta talk to the high aldwin.}
<C>__{meegosh}
<P>__{(truly amazed)}
<D>__{the high aldwin?? why?}
<A>__{but willow has already wandered into the crowd, leaving meegosh with a dozen sugar charged children and a pig. willow desperately pushes past people and finally reaches the high aldwin.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{sir! i have to talk to you.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{not today, willow.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{it's a matter of great importance to me!}
<A>__{burglekutt stares angrily from his platform. slightly annoyed, the high aldwin stops and places his hand on willow's shoulder.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{intuition, willow remember? i know you're eager to be my appren tice, willow. but today is the spring festival.}
<A>__{suddenly a walking stick is pointed at willow's nose.}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{apprentice? to the high aldwin!! willow ufgood???}
<A>__{his belly shakes as he howls with laughter, encouraging his councilmen to join in. willow shrinks away, em barassed. then a terrified shriek shatters the festivity. music stops and people grab their children and run for their lives. a death dog rips a trail of destruction through the village. meegosh holds onto ranon and mims. but when mims sees willow she runs right out into the open. willow charges twoard her, tackling her and rolling away from the beast's claws.}
<C>__{death dog}
<D>__{bordak! bordak!}
<A>__{a loud war cry distracts the dog. vohnkar, the toughest warrior in the village, leads a charging army of miners and farmers wielding shovels and picks. wil low and meegosh grab sticks. the nelwyns battle the death dog. at last, vohnkar drives a spear through its chest and it dies hideously.}
<C>__{meegosh}
<D>__{what was it looking for?}
<C>__{a villager}
<D>__{it said "bordak"! what does it mean?}
<C>__{councilman}
<P>__{(scholarly)}
<D>__{baby! it means baby! it was look ing for somebody's baby!}
<A>__{mothers grab their children, people look around the wrecked village in terror. there's a haunting silence.}
<C>__{mims}
<D>__{mommy?}
<A>__{suddenly alarmed, willow races towrd his distant farm, his children hurrying behind.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{kiaya! kiaya!}
