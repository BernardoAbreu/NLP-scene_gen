<D>__{my first day as a copy boy i was sixteen and wearing my only grown up suit it was cream colored. at 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says, "my god, haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? if it's not washed by three, it'll never by dry for tomorrow."}
<P>__{(woodward is getting interested in the story now)}
<D>__{and i said, "am i supposed to do that?" and he said, "absolutely, it's crucial." so i run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room. i'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak, and he says, "what the fuck do you think you're doing?" and i said, "it's 2:30. i'm washing the carbon paper."}
