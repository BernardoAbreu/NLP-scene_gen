<A>__{the formerly idyllic landscape has been reduced to a scorched battlefield. wooden huts leveled. small fires dot the land. the air thick with ash and greasy smoke. dozens of monks swarm across the countryside like ants on a mound of spilt sugar. in one hand a taper or torch held high, in the other hand their weapon: scythe, pitchfork, hoe, whatever they could get ahold of, seem pitifully out of place. some pound sharpened stakes into the ground, others push carts into rough barricades. a "platoon" of monks huddle around trap doors open on the wooden "ground." more ladders. they climb down to an underground wheat field night just beneath the monastery level of the satellite: an underground wheatfield. tall golden grass stretches out for miles, swaying gently around huge wooden columns that support the abbey fifty feet above }

<B>__{the monks}
<A>__{descend the ladders single file. fear is in all of their faces though most have only heard the stories. they move cautiously into the wheat. spread out through the field in the jaggedly drawn skirmish line.}

<A>__{then another movement catches the abbot's eye ahead of the monks the wheat waves against the wind. begins to ripple the wheat flattens. a trail forms. something is moving in the long grass. moving towards the lead monk fast. the abbot opens his mouth as if to shout a warning even though the monk closest to the moving trail is too far away to hear him before he can make a sound the alien closes the gap feeling horribly helpless he can only watch as aargh aa ! the lead monk gives one strangled cry before he disappears beneath the surface of the long grass. his taper falls among the long, dry stalks begins to smoke... the abbot can see the trail moving towards his men before they can. he finds his voice:}

<D>__{no no. the }
<A>__{the alien hits the skirmish line at a flanking angle raking through five monks like a scythe through wheat. his tail, arms whip out snap their spines like kindling. lost torches ignite the wheat... the field bursts into flame. smoke fills the air. in the smoky commotion the monks break rank and start running. weapons in front of them swinging wildly screaming. crying. dying. one frightened monk runs through another with his pitchfork. another hears something crashing through the grass towards him and buries his scythe in his best friend's chest. and through it all the alien seems to be everywhere. using the chalky smoke for cover as it slashes and tears its way across the field }
<B>__{the abbot}
<A>__{frozen in terror to the spot. squints through the smoke to see what has happened to his flock. hears the wails of defeat rising up from the wounded. the waving grass is flattened as the alien moves towards him he can finally pry himself from his perch on the wagon. he climbs down. as his feet hit the wooden floor he feels a shadow fall over him. the little hairs on the back of his neck stand up. he slowly turns...}
<B>__{the alien}
<A>__{rises out of the grass in front of the holy man. slowly rises up to its height of almost three meters. it's long, smooth head is no longer black and slimy. it is golden. it's cable like arms are sheathed in a straw like covering. it has adapted to the environment of the wheat field. its now grass like lips draw back into a ghastly parody of a smile. the abbot screams and runs.}
