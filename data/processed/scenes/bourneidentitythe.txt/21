<A>__{ stopping as the man slams the gun against his temple and this fight is over. the man standing there. in the silence. two unconscious cops at his feet. blood on his pants. what just happened? how did he do this? and there's the gun in his hand. and god, it just feels so natural checking it stripping it down holding it aiming it like this is something he's done a million times before... this is something he definitely knows how to do. and then he stops cold. throwing down the gun. running off into the darkness }
