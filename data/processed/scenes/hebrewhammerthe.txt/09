<C>__{teenage gentile}
<D>__{hey teddy, throw me the frisbee.}
<A>__{teddy (the non speaking teen gentile) throws the yarmulke, and we follow it as it spins towards another teenage gentile. the other teenage gentile excitedly extends his hands to catch, but right before it reaches him another hand comes into frame and snatches it. he looks up, and we cut to his... pov as we tilt up to reveal the hammer. he looks pretty damn big and pissed off from this angle. the teenage gentile begins to shake and stammer.}
