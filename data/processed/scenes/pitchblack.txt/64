<A>__{through a window, we see the johns and the chrislams crawling over the moisture recovery unit, assessing repairs. pull back to include fry inside the settlement, inspecting... refectory table. place settings out. years of dust. photos on the wall: settlers working modest gardens. playing baseball. posing with children.}

<D>__{lights.}
<A>__{no response to her command. she pats around for old style wall switches. nothing. perceiving black out blinds on a window, she throws them open to reveal... a man standing right outside .}

<D>__{hey. don't go too far, huh?}
<A>__{fry nods. johns smiles, leaves. just as her heart settles, something creaks behind her. it's an orrery, a mechanical device that shows the motion of the planets around their suns. solar powered, the orrery starts turning, creaking. one planet seems always to have sunlight.}
