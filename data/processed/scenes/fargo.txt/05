<A>__{the car approaches, slowing. carl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen in the headlights. the car accelerates and roars past and away. we just make out the silhouettes of two occupants in front.}

<A>__{grimsrud slides into the driver's seat. he squeals into a u turn, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin. small red tail lights fishtail up ahead. the pursued car churns up fine snow. grimsrud takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in his ashtray. we hear the churning of the car wheels and the pinging of snow clods and salt on the car's underside. in the back seat, jean starts screaming. grimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights. he fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face. the red tail lights ahead start to turn. with a distant crunching sound, they disappear. the headlights now show only empty road, starting to turn. grimsrud frowns and slows. his headlights show the car up ahead off the road, crumpled around a telephone pole, having failed to hold a turn. grimsrud brakes. jean slides off the back seat and thumps into the legwell. grimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat, throws open his door and gets out.}
