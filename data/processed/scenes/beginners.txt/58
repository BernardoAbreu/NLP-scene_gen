<A>__{oliver snaps out of his memory. he makes his way through the crowd and delivers the drink to her. he looks at her a little too intensely, then blurts out.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{would you like to dance?}
<A>__{she happily nods yes. they walk to the dance floor, we think oliver's going to be shy, but he breaks into a kinetic, angular, dance. she's surprised with us she laughs, they have a good time.}
