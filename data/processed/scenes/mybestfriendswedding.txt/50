<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{a modern take on the medieval castle kitchen, towering ceilings, dark wood, copper pots hanging, a series of walk in coolers and freezers. the place is a madhouse of activity, as prep cooks slice, chop, sort, every kind of food imaginable, and delivery teams bring more. the girls walk through. alone together in the eye of the hurricane. kim choked with excess sentiment...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{they'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?}
<A>__{kimmy's lip trembles. this is not how she thought of her wedding. the din is so horrific, kimmy leads them into a walk in meat locker. even here, two butchers are dressing eastern fresh corn fed carcasses.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{you guys want to give us a minute?}
<A>__{the men blink at each other.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{we'd like to be alone with our pork.}
<A>__{on that basis. they leave. kimmy sits on a stack of packaged frozen fowl parts. stares up with big, sweet, wet eyes.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{how's he doing?}
<A>__{julianne cannot believe this.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{who? the jerk who's running your life?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{this must be... very, very, hard on him.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{what with the psychosis and all, yeah.}
<A>__{leans in. listen...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{when are you gonna come clean with your folks?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{don't you see...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{if you're waiting for "do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{... that this is all my fault?}
<A>__{stops julianne cold. your fault.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{whatever delusions i drove him to, there is truth at the heart of it. i want him to work for my father. i want to stay in school. i want a life of my own!}
<A>__{harder and harder for julianne to push. her mouth is dry.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{i love him.}
<A>__{fragile and strong at once. a plea.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{tell him it's my fault and that i love him.}
<A>__{a long beat.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i will be right back.}
