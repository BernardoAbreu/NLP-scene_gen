<L>__{exterior school}
<A>__{ed is among the crowd streaming from the gym into the warm summer night. he looks around the parking lot.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...i could afford to charge less than the usual manager, not having to put up a big front like a lot of these phonies. and i could be with her, enough to keep myself feeling ok...}
<A>__{a trace of a frown as he spots her leaning against a car, laughing, passing a cigarette back and forth with another student a boy.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...why couldn't that work?... why not?...}
<A>__{birdy's easy smile remains as ed approaches, but the boy's drops; he puts on a face more suitable for meeting adults.}
<C>__{birdy}
<D>__{hi, mr crane.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{hello, birdy. i thought that was very good.}
<C>__{birdy}
<D>__{oh, in there? i messed up a little bit in the scherzo. i guess, if nobody noticed, it's ok. mr crane, this is tony, a friend of mine. tony, mr crane.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{hello, tony.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{hello, sir.}
<A>__{silence. the teens wait for the adult to direct the conversation; ed has nothing to say. at length, he clears his throat.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...well, congratulations. i guess i will be getting home.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{nice to meet you, sir.}
<B>__{turandot suite}
<A>__{it is morning. we are tracking past an unmade bed toward the bathroom, where we hear water running.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...anyway, that's what i was thinking about in the days leading up to the trial. it seemed like once that was over, i'd be ready for a new start. freddy riedenschneider was very optimistic. he was busy preparing...}
<A>__{we have rounded the open bathroom door to find riedenschneider hunched over the sink, toothbrush in hand, spitting out water. he rises, looks at himself in the mirror, sprinkles some tonic in his hair.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...and finally it came... the first day of the trial...}
<A>__{riedenschneider runs his fingers through his hair.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...what riedenschneider called the big show.}
<A>__{he straightens his tie, gives his neck a twist.}
<B>__{courtroom}
<A>__{we are close on the back of riedenschneider's gleaming hair. he is sitting at the defense table. there is a murmur of a crowd that has yet to be called to order.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{where's the judge? how come there's no judge?}
<A>__{ed and frank sit next to each other in the first gallery row directly behind riedenschneider.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{...where's the judge, ed?}
<A>__{ed shrugs. frank looks at riedenschneider's back.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{...how come the judge doesn't come out?}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{the judge comes in last. he'll come in when doris gets here.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{so where's doris? i thought we started at ten. hey, riedenschneider, where's doris?}
<A>__{riedenschneider is curt:}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{she's late.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{late? how can she be late?}
<A>__{riedenschneider doesn't answer; frank turns to ed.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{...she's in prison, ed. none of us are in prison, and yet we're not late. we're on time, ed. how can doris be late? what, they don't have wake up calls?}
<A>__{the murmur of the crowd subsides as a door behind the judge's bench opens and the judge hurriedly enters. the gallery rises but the judge quickly waves them back down and, rather than seating himself, leans forward over his desk to give a peremptory beckoning wave to riedenschneider and the prosecutor.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{counselors.}
<A>__{riedenschneider, puzzled, approaches the bench, as does his counterpart from the other table. the judge, still leaning forward, speaks to them in a low voice that is not audible from the gallery. the crowd has started murmuring again, also in hushed tones. frank leans in toward ed.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what's going on, ed? i thought there would be arguments. the bailiff, and so forth...}
<A>__{ed, also puzzled, is watching riedenschneider, who suddenly stiffens. as the judge continues to talk, riedenschneider looks back over his shoulder at ed.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{...ed, what is this? is this procedure?}
<A>__{the two lawyers nod at the judge and walk back to their respective tables. the judge now summons a uniformed man standing to one side.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{bailiff.}
<A>__{as the judge and the bailiff confer, riedenschneider looks down at his desk and, for something to do, straightens various papers.}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{i don't understand... we had a real shot at it... we could have won this thing...}
<A>__{the bailiff announces:}
<C>__{bailiff}
<D>__{in the matter of the state of california versus doris crane, case number 87249 assigned to this superior court...}
<A>__{as the bailiff drones, riedenschneider shakes his head.}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{...it doesn't make any sense...}
<B>__{barbershop}
<A>__{late afternoon sun slants in. the shop, not open for business, is very still. ed, in his courtroom suit, sits in one of the vinyl chairs that line the wall, hunched forward, forearms on his knees. frank, also still in his suit, is up in one of the barber chairs, one hand cupped to his forehead, weeping.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{she'd hanged herself. i'd brought her a dress to wear to court and she'd used the belt. i didn't understand it either. at first i thought maybe it had something to do with me, that she'd figured out somehow how i fit into it and couldn't stand it, couldn't stand knowing...}
<B>__{bedroom}
<A>__{night. ed is in bed, staring at the ceiling.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...that wasn't it, i would find out later. for now, everything just seemed ruined...}
<B>__{metropole lobby}
<A>__{riedenschneider is at the cashier's desk, checking out. behind him a bellman's cart is piled high with his bags.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...freddy riedenschneider went back to sacramento still shaking his head, saying it was the biggest disappointment of his professional career...}
<A>__{frank's house day. frank's kitchen. frank sits at his kitchen table, staring, in a bathrobe thrown over his pyjamas, unshaven.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...frankie fell to pieces. i suspect he was drinking; anyway, he stopped coming to work...}
<B>__{barbershop}
<A>__{ed, in his smock, works on a customer.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...that left me to keep the place going, or the bank would've taken it.}
<A>__{as he uses the electric clippers, a cigarette plumes between his lips. he squints against the smoke drifting past his eyes.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...i was the principal barber now. i hired a new man for the second chair...}
<A>__{ed's former chair is indeed being manned by a newcomer, a gangly young man who animatedly chats up his customer.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...i'd hired the guy who did the least gabbing when he came in for an interview. but i guess the new man had only kept quiet because he was nervous; once he had the job, he talked from the minute i opened the shop in the morning...}
