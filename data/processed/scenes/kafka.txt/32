<D>__{if it was accounts you wanted why did you ask for employees?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{orlac is an account?}
<C>__{keeper}
<D>__{it's a factory in the northern mountains. one of our best customers.}
<P>__{(as they disappear around a corner)}
<D>__{without a proper request i'm not obliged to do this, you understand but i will make an exception on this one occasion.}
<B>__{another row}
<A>__{kafka glances nervously around as shelves creak threateningly under the weight of documents. up on a ladder, the keeper of the files finds the orlac folder.}
<C>__{keeper}
<D>__{at least the account is current even if the employee isn't.}
<A>__{he pulls it out with great difficulty. the orlac file is very, very thick. kafka prepares himself to catch it, but the keeper of the files manages to hand it down to him without serious injury. still, it's quite cumbersome and heavier than kafka expects.}
<C>__{keeper}
<P>__{(coming down ladder)}
<D>__{that place has so many accidents, it's a good thing the type of peasants who live up there don't seem to have any trouble propagating their race.}

<P>__{(leafing through pages)}
<D>__{all these in the last year?}
<C>__{keeper}
<D>__{you must have read about it in the papers there was a terrible cave in. it wouldn't have been so bad, but even the medical officer for the district was killed!}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i did read that. they gave him a posthumous medal.}
<C>__{keeper}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{dr. murnau was the bravest of men. he spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain. a great loss.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(a particular document)}
<D>__{this is the cross reference of clerks who've worked on orlac claims?}
<C>__{keeper}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{is your friend's name among them?}
<P>__{(kafka shakes his head)}
<D>__{then he only worked on the one case.}

<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{once a file's been sent to the caste, is it possible to recall it for review?}
<C>__{keeper}
<P>__{(going back up ladder)}
<D>__{of course not. only by a director of the firm. who'd want to let in all kinds of riff raff off the streets?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{what good are records if they're not open for public inspection?}
<C>__{keeper}
<P>__{(stuffing file back in place)}

<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{what if i petitioned one of the directors?}
<C>__{keeper}
<P>__{(coming back down)}
<D>__{you do not summon them they summon you and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. the directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.}

<D>__{where do our records go to in the castle?}
<C>__{keeper}
<P>__{(starting to walk away)}
<D>__{we're a medical firm, aren't we? they go to the medical records section.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i could always apply there.}
<C>__{keeper}
<D>__{it so happens, my dear simple sir, that the head of medical records at the castle is one of the directors of this firm.}
<A>__{kafka scowls, and follows the keeper of the files in silence.}
