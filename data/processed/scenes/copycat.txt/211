<L>__{interior auditorium night}
<A>__{the huge doors creak open and helen enters. she stands, listening: light streams in from the exterior through tall windows, otherwise it's all back shadows, weird enough without the distorted vision, the vertigo that momentarily returns... helen wills herself to move into the deep space before her. she stands listening: we hear the creaks and tiny snaps of a building cooling in the night air. or is the movement of peter somewhere in the room? she whirls to face a distance sound that echoes in the auditorium... close: helen staring, trying to see. nothing.}
