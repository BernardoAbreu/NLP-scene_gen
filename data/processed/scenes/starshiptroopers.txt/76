<L>__{exterior live fire combat range day the recruits}
<A>__{arm their marauder power suits. zim and bronski wear command model suits with rank designations. johnny checks weapons, scans the electronics on each squad member's power suit.}
<C>__{zim}
<D>__{with the marauder's visual capabilities, all you have to do is look at something to hit it, so you will exercise extreme care on my firing line. do you get me ?}
<C>__{recruits}
<D>__{sir, yes, sir !}
<C>__{zim}
<D>__{the live firing combat range is the closest simulation of actual combat we can provide. if you do not hit your target, it will shoot you...}
<A>__{fifty blackened automated target drones fitted with pulse guns are presently visible along a gauntlet of low walls, gullies, and three story building facades.}
<C>__{zim}
<D>__{the marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{sir, yes, sir !}
<A>__{on a signal from zim, the live fire combat range comes to life as the target drones take cover and disappear from view.}
<C>__{zim}
<D>__{perfect score for this exercise is 300. b company came through last week with 285. i expect you to do better.}
