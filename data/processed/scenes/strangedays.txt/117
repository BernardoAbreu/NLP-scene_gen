<L>__{interior lenny's apartment}
<A>__{as lenny is hanging up he notices something. a manila envelope stuck between the steel bars and the glass of his front window, next to the door. "nero" is printed on the envelope. oh shit. he opens the door, looking both ways. no one is around. he fishes out the envelope from behind the bars and takes it inside. of course it contains a tape. he stares at it with dread. lenny sits down and put the tape in his playback deck. he picks up the trodes and places them on his head. he notices his hands are shaking. he takes a deep breath and punches play. pov sequence: day. as expected we see the de saturated signature look of the killer's vision. the wearer is walking through the courtyard of lenny's apartment building. we recognize it by the unkempt pool, the sunken deck furniture. we walk through a breezeway to an ally like courtyard behind the building. we approach a door... the back door to lenny's apartment. the killer picks the lock on the back door. opens the door and enters. the apartment is dark, blacked out. we are in the kitchen. we stop and listen. water dripping in the sink. soft snoring from the living room. moving to the other room. slowly, silently. furtively looking around the door frame to the living room. there is lenny, crashed out on the couch. now moving stealthily toward him. kneeling down beside him. lenny, burned out from the night before, is deep under. our hand comes into view, holding the yellow plastic razor knife. with his thumb, the killer extends the blade... click, click, click, click. the blade flashes in a beam of sunlight as it moves toward lenny. the killer lays it gently against lenny's throat. draws it slowly across... not leaving a mark. the pov backs away and static as the tape ends. lenny, in the present, whips off the trodes, freaking. he feels around his throat with one hand... can't feel anything. crossing quickly to a mirror near the front door, he inspects his neck minutely. there is a hair line red line over his carotid. he looks around the room wildly, his heart hammering. slowly, he gets his breathing under control. then... he hears something in the kitchen. a tiny click. his eyes go wide. hyperventilating, lenny moves silently into the bedroom. he fishes around under the bed and pulls out a glock 22 .45 auto pistol. he stalks silently toward the kitchen. then he looks at the butt of the pistol grip: no magazine. he un stalks back to the bed and finds a loaded magazine under a bunch of dirty socks. he inserts it quietly, wincing as he chambers a round. heart thudding, he works his way to the kitchen door. he edges around the frame, pie ing the room. cop reflexes intact. mace is sitting at the kitchen table, giving him a funny look. she is drinking a cup of coffee, made from the bottle of instant on the counter. she is dressed casually, in bicycle pants, work boots and oversized nylon jacket over a tank top.}
