<C>__{palantine}
<P>__{(in distance)}
<D>__{... pit black against white, young against old, sow anger, disunity and suspicion and all in the name of the "good of the country." well, their game is over.}
<P>__{(applause)}
<D>__{all their games are over. now is the time to stand up against such foolishness, propaganda and demagoguery. now is the time for one man to stand up and accept his neighbor, for one man to give in order that all might receive. is unity and love of common good such a lost thing?}
<A>__{all live sound ceases as travis' narration begins. he is reading from a letter or card he has just written. as he speaks we see shots of palantine speaking, a seated row of young black palantine red, white and blue bedecked cheerleaders, secret service agents examining the crowd and so forth. these shots have no direct relationship to the narration.}
<C>__{travis }
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{dear father and mother, june is the month, i remember, which brings not only your wedding anniversary, but also father's day and mother's birthday. i'm sorry i can't remember the exact dates, but i hope this card will take care of all of them. i'm sorry i again can not send you my address like i promised to last year, but the sensitive nature of my work for the army demands utmost secrecy. i know you will understand. i am healthy and well and making lots of money. i have been going with a girl for several months and i know you would be proud if you could see her.}

<D>__{i hope this card finds you all well, as it does me. i hope no one has died. don't worry about me. one day there will be a knock on the door and it will be me. love, travis.}
<A>__{travis, at his desk, examines the card upon which he has just written this letter. c.u. cover of card. it is a 25 wedding anniversary card with a four color embossed cover. the design could only be described as ur kitsch. a cartoon mr. and mrs. all america stand before an outdoor barbecuing grill, clicking salt and pepper shakers in a toast. sentiment reads:}
<B>__{happy anniversary}
<A>__{to a couple who have found the perfect combination for marriage... the card opens to read:}
