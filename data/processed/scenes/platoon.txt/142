<L>__{exterior perimeter #3 chris' foxhole night}
<A>__{on their foxhole, chris and francis wait anxiously. overhead the artillery keeps pounding into the ambush area. now small arms fire can be heard picking up at random spots along the perimeter. the battle, like a tide, is obviously moving closer to them.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{oh shit me i wish i was back in memphis now, oooh baby this is gonna be a motherfucker!}
<A>__{chris says nothing. suddenly off to their right, about 80 yards, a blue fizzle of light erupts.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{trip flares! ... rodriguez's hole.}
<A>__{rat tat tat tat, rat tat tat. machine gun, outgoing, followed by a sharp explosion. a rocket!}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{rpgs! shit!}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{medic!! doc! doc!}
<A>__{a figure thrashes up through the foliage behind them.}
<C>__{rhah}
<P>__{(a fierce whisper)}
<D>__{taylor! francis!}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{over here!}
<A>__{rhah jumps into their hole with them, out of breath.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{rhah! what's going on. rodriguez's hole just got ...}
<C>__{rhah}
<P>__{(gets his breath)}
<D>__{okay, here it is one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{oh shit! dat's it, dat's it ...}
<C>__{rhah}
<D>__{they got through alpha company! anything behind you don't identify itself, blow it away. two air strike's coming in. they gonna lay snake and nape right on the perimeter so stay tight in your holes and don't leave 'em.}
<A>__{flares now shoot up over the perimeter. reds, greens, yellows, squeaking as they float doen on their parachute hinges throughout the ensuing battle. the perimeter is illuminated at spotty intervals sometimes arctic bright, sometimes inexplainably dark til new flares shoot up. chris, francis, rhah all look up at the light, and hug their holes even tighter, feeling naked in the light. flares cut both ways.}
<C>__{rhah }
<D>__{... they're probing us, they gonna go up and down this line all night trying to get through. stay cool ... i will be back ...}
<A>__{runs out of the foxhole. chris suddenly reacting to a noise out front, gripping francis and pointing to the sound. a body is thrashing towards them, about twenty five yards, not yet visible but a little awkward and lungy in it's movement, as if desperate. francis, tense, is about to pop his grenade when chris grabs him.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{hold it!}
<P>__{(loud whisper)}
<D>__{who is it!}
<A>__{but the body keeps coming, lurching now, falling.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{come on man!}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{a pop! then a fizzle of blue light as the figure hits their trip flare revealing itself to be large, with no helmet, and gasping, terrified of the trip flare.}
<C>__{terrified soldier}
<D>__{don't shoot! don't shoot!}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{it's the ambush!}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{in here, man! hurry.}
<A>__{the soldier now runs in like a fullback going down for the tackle, sprawling into the hole, knocking chris and francis down beneath him. he is sweating, terrified, a white boy with an unrecognizable, filthy face, no rifle, no helmet, his fatigues torn all over.}
<C>__{terrified soldier}
<D>__{water! water!}
<A>__{chris gives him his canteen, his shoulder and neck hurting from the collision. the soldier sucks down the canteen.}
<C>__{terrified soldier }
<P>__{(between gulps)}
<D>__{they'se all over the place, hundreds of em moving this way! they wiped us out man, we didn't have a chance! where's the cp?}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{back there.}
<A>__{the soldier struggling out of the foxhole.}
<C>__{terrified soldier}
<D>__{you guys get outta here! they're right on my ass and they ain't stoppin' for shit!}
<A>__{he tears off, leaving francis in a state of incipient panic. he looks at chris.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{taylor, let's di di man!}
<A>__{chris adjusting position, facing the front, anger in his voice.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you go.}
<A>__{francis hesitates, stays.}
