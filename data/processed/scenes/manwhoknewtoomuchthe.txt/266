<A>__{in the corridor once again mrs. drayton locks the door, and crosses the hall. the camera panning her. she enters another door.}
<L>__{interior ambrose chapel (day) med. shot}
<A>__{she enters a larger, more ornate room. the camera pans her in, and we see first drayton, who is putting on a surplice and then the man who knocked on the mckennas' door in the mamounia hotel, looking for someone named montgomery. he is putting on a tie and tuxedo. he wears a dangerous looking revolver strapped underneath his armpit; mrs. drayton, without a word, sits down and lights a cigarette, exhaling with something close to fatigue. then she speaks.}
<C>__{mrs. drayton}
<D>__{i wish it was tomorrow.}
<A>__{drayton turns, having finished his dressing.}
<C>__{drayton}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{that's not a very orthodox sentiment.}
<A>__{he goes to a desk, and takes something out of a drawer. it is a small envelope. he turns to the man with the gun.}
<C>__{drayton}
<D>__{two excellent tickets for the concert at the albert hall with my compliments.}
<A>__{he hands them to rien. rien takes the envelope, glances at it briefly, then puts it into his pocket.}
<C>__{drayton}
<D>__{your box is nicely placed, or shall we say strategically placed.}
<A>__{he goes to a portable record player, which is open and has a record on it. he looks down at the phonograph.}
<C>__{drayton}
<D>__{now for the most important part.}
<A>__{he gestured towards the record.}
<C>__{rien}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{drayton}
<D>__{a record of the delightful picco they will play tonight.}
<C>__{rien}
<D>__{what about it?}
<C>__{drayton}
<D>__{music is less in your line than marksmanship. if you will listen, my friend, i will play for you the exact moment at which you can shoot. now listen carefully.}
<A>__{drayton plays the record.}
<C>__{drayton}
<D>__{let me do it for you again. now listen for the cymbal crash.}
<A>__{drayton plays the record again and claps his hands together at the cymbal crash.}
<C>__{drayton}
<D>__{you see at such a moment your shot will not be heard. the listeners will not even be disturbed. i think the composer would have appreciated that. no one will know.}
<C>__{rien}
<D>__{none except one you mean.}
<A>__{the assassin smiles.}
<C>__{drayton}
<D>__{ah, yes if you are clever, my friend. any questions musical or otherwise?}
<C>__{rien}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{drayton}
<D>__{there's's one comforting thought. it happens early in the evening. i hope i won't upset you if i say there's time for one shot only. if you need another, the risk is yours.}
<C>__{rien}
<D>__{i do not take risks.}
<C>__{drayton}
<D>__{that's a comfort traipsing all the way down to marrakesh to fetch you i should like you to do me credit.}
<A>__{he looks at his watch.}
<C>__{drayton}
<D>__{your distinguished target's on the way there now. a car is waiting for you downstairs at the back entrance. you will pick up a miss benson on your way. she will be your companion in the box. she's there to lend an air of respectability...if that's possible.}
<C>__{rien}
<D>__{you will have the money when i return?}
<C>__{drayton}
<D>__{i think you can trust me.}
<C>__{rien}
<P>__{(looking him up and down)}
<D>__{what is your english proverb a wolf in sheep's clothing?}
<A>__{drayton laughs.}
<C>__{drayton}
<D>__{i think you had better be going. it is impolite to be late for a concert. it would be awkward if they made you wait until the first selection is over.}
<A>__{he turns to his wife.}
<C>__{drayton}
<D>__{see him downstairs, my dear.}
<P>__{(to rien)}
<D>__{i'm sorry you must sneak out the back way, but we have to preserve our respectable front.}
<A>__{she exits with the assassin. drayton turns to the mirror and surveys himself.}
