<L>__{interior memory studio day}
<A>__{quail is stretched out on a plush reclining couch, alongside some strange looking lab equipment, wearing a hospital type smock. in the b.g. hovers a technician, adjusting some instrumentation (discreet banks of computers, etc.) that apparently relates to the lab equipment next to quail. the room in a dim, soothing booth, lit by indirect lighting. quail looks a little concerned as he studies all the instrumentation next to him as one always does at the dentist's, looking at the drills. the door opens abruptly, in walks a cute looking little old lady, wearing a jogging suit. (a ruth gordon type.)}

<P>__{(at machine)}
<D>__{okay that's it.}
<A>__{now, lull extends a long rubber tube, a hypodermic needle attached to it. quail eyes it warily. she swabs the back of his hand in preparation, notices his apprehension.}
<C>__{lull}
<D>__{now, just relax, kid. this ain't gonna hurt. just a controlled drip of narkadine. when you're under, i will just ask ya a few questions, nothin' real personal, just full details of yer private life so's we can tailor the wish fulfillment program to your needs.}

<P>__{(sleepily)}
<D>__{one hundred... ninety nine... ninety eight... ninety seven... ninety six... ninety five....}
<A>__{his voice drops off; his eyes close. lull studies him, adjusts some instruments, then turns to ernie, glancing briefly at a typed sheet in front of her.}
