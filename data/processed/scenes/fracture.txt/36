<C>__{willy}
<D>__{it was a good bust, so calvin came to me for a deal. i told him if he could arrange an interview for me with mr. wooton, i would throw the case. i laid out his arguments and evidence for him and i showed him how i would lose. calvin set up my appointment for the day after our court date. then he did what i had suggested in court and i wiped the floor with him. your client got the maximum. next day, i met with mr. wooton.}

<D>__{you gonna get that?}
<C>__{willy}
