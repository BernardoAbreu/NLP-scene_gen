<ACTION>__{Glaring fluorescence, trash overflowing with cheap detergent boxes, empty Coke machine flashing all lights orange. Only two dryers are humming. It's very late. Keep PANNING to... ...a wiry, gimlet-eyed WOMAN, furtively removing crumpled newspapers from a dryer. She flattens and folds them meticulously, her glance darting angrily everywhere. Top secret mission. ...a natty little black man. PARTRIDGE has spread a late supper on a neat cloth atop a dryer. Small cold fowl. Brie, baguette, olives. Bottle of red. An air of competence, of indomitable upbeatness. He ignores the spy-dressed-as-bag-lady as if she were normal. More curious about... ...a hulking, rumpled figure scrutinizing Help Wanted ads as if cramming for life's midterm exam. Thoughtful. Circles one, slowly. Set out on QUOYLE's dryer are one Snickers bar and four empty snickers wrappers. His version of cold supper. He reaches for the candy, but seeing it's the last one, he... ...rises. Goes to the candy machine. Drops in his 65 cents, hits the button. The Snickers starts to fall, but gets caught in the mechanism at the last moment. Quoyle blinks dully. One more retelling of the story of his life. He BANGS the machine half- heartedly. Nope. Shakes it with his shambling strength. Nada. POUNDS the coin return button. Hat trick. He empties his pocket. Studies the results. Not enough. And without so much as a sigh... ...he ambles back to his dryer. Starts to unwrap the last Snickers. Partridge taking this all in. But Mata Hari of the Neat Newspapers goes to the candy machine, KICKS it violently. Out fall the Snickers and the 65 cents. She scoops up both, turns in a single motion to... ...GLARE death at the enemy. Quoyle opens his mouth to comment. But. Doesn't. Resumes unwrapping his supper, as... ...his dryer STOPS. He pops it open. Stares in. Blinks. Suddenly YANKS a tangle of graying shirts out onto the grimy floor to reveal they have been... ...STAINED streaky BLUE by a cheap pen, quietly melting amid the pile. This slips beneath even Quoyle's expectation level. The big, soft face is pitifully, yes, even adorably, devastated.}

<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We're the ones have to be awake. To how much we love him...}
<ACTION>__{Nods to himself.     Yes.}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And how we should be good to each other. While we have the chance.}
<ACTION>__{He looks down.     They are almost there.}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You think?}
<ACTION>__{She is thinking. Keeping the thoughts to herself. At the coffin now, he lifts her up to see. Jack lies motionless, a wax figure of himself. Serene behind violet eyelids.}
<CHAR>__{BUNNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He looks like he's sleeping.}
<ACTION>__{Dennis looks over.     His stolid, grim face releases a smile for his friend.}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's cos he's peaceful. No worries, anymore. No troubles.}
<ACTION>__{He sets her down.     Clasps Mrs. Buggit's hand.     And from his pocket...}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I found this in Jack's drawer at the paper. I don't know if it's somethin' special...}
<ACTION>__{An enameled wreath with the initial R, backed by a long, sharp pin She tears up again, just to see it.}
<CHAR>__{MRS. BUGGIT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, it's his lodge pin.    We were lookin' all over.}
<ACTION>__{She smiles bravely as she takes it.    Leans up to kiss his cheek.}
<CHAR>__{MRS. BUGGIT } <CHAR_PAR>__{(a whisper)}
<DIAL>__{Dennis showed me what y'wrote fer th' paper. Did Jack proud.}
<ACTION>__{So they look at each other. Dennis clears his throat, looks away. And then, Quoyle is leading Bunny off.}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You hungry? There's sandwi...}
<CHAR>__{BUNNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Petal's peaceful, too.}
<ACTION>__{Just a statement of fact.    To no one in particular.   Dad squeezes her hand. Manages...}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You bet.    You can count on tha...}
<ACTION>__{But she lets go. Scampers to a corner of the room.      To Herry Prowse. And his mom. So Quoyle starts toward her, his heart in his throat. And when Wavey looks up. She is glad to see him. As he reaches her... She holds up her wrist. Dangling from it, her turquoise bracelet She wore her best for Jack. Quoyle stands very close. One last thing from his pocket...}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{New Year's present.}
<ACTION>__{A small box. Wrapped as careful as he could.     She looks to his eyes, really?}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, yeh.    It's a Quoyle tradition.}
<ACTION>__{Well, in that case. She takes it into her slender fingers. Undoes the ribbon, the paper. Lifts the lid to see, resting in tissue... ...eggshells. Crushed almost to powder. Her heart comes straight to her eyes, even before the whispered...}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks.   For the mirror.}
<ACTION>__{And across the room, Mrs. Buggit leans with trembling hands to fix the Lodge pin to Jack's lapel. Shaking as she is, the hand lurches, the big pin goes PLUNGING, and... ...a rattling COUGH. Rolls across this room. The world falls silent. Jack's wife grabs her son's arm, and their eyes bug out, staring into the box.}
<CHAR>__{DENNIS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{DAD'S COME BACK!}
<ACTION>__{And LUNGES to help hs gurgling father free his shoulders from the coffin's wedge. A sudden ROAR, there are SCREAMS, there is even LAUGHTER and WHISTLING, complete chaos. And in the bedlam, a tug on Quoyle's coat...}
<CHAR>__{BUNNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{See.   He woke up.}
<LOC>__{EXT. OMALOOR BAY - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Sunlit day of crystal perfection. The majesty of ice and towering rock and shimmering water. A scale so majestic, any cynic would be hard put to deny God's hand. And gliding into FRAME... ...a tiny skiff.     On its maiden run.   We CLOSE to see... ...painted on its side. THE FOUR WOMEN. One woman is rowing just now, doing all the work. Her son sleeps in the bow. And in the middle of the little boat... ...father and daughter. Are unpacking the picnic lunch.        There is a lot of food. This could take awhile.}
<CHAR>__{BUNNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's a funny thing to say.   For the first thing he said.}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What? 'I'm keepin' m'damn lobster license'?}
<ACTION>__{Yeh.   That.}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maybe he just said it. To make your Uncle Dennis laugh so hard. You think?}
<ACTION>__{She keeps unpacking.      Her face quiet and serious.   Her thoughts her own.}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(very softly)}
<DIAL>__{It's not fair, is it. That Jack woke up. And Petal didn't.}
<ACTION>__{And since he's said her thought aloud.      She tells him...}
<CHAR>__{BUNNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well.     The world's not fair.     You said.}
<ACTION>__{She's not looking up.      But he knows she's listening.}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's something the world is always teaching us. And sometimes, the learning comes later.}
<ACTION>__{That gets through.    Both adults can see it.}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(a murmur)}
<DIAL>__{You taught me that.}
<ACTION>__{Eyes resolutely down, she nods.      Remembers.}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know. What we wait for? It's like the main stem of this boat. It gives us our shape.}
<ACTION>__{Her brow furrows.    Doesn't understand that.}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{See, I know why you saved a place for Petal. All this time.}
<ACTION>__{On this.   She looks up.     Her dad is smiling from his eyes.}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Cos I'm the daddy. And you learn how to do. By watching me.}
<ACTION>__{And...}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You just watched.     Better than I knew.}
<ACTION>__{Still holding Bunny's eyes. He beckons to the woman rowing. C'mere, a second. So Wavey sets down her oars. Slides over. And Quoyle whispers to his daughter...}
<CHAR>__{QUOYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Watch this.}
<ACTION>__{He leans his face. To Wavey's mouth. A kiss so tender, even a child can't turn away. The moment lingers. And when it ends...}
<CHAR>__{WAVEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm thanking your daddy.     For all my presents.}
<CHAR>__{BUNNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There was only two.}
<ACTION>__{Wavey looks at this girl.}
<CHAR>__{WAVEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{More than two. Everything I need. Except...}
<ACTION>__{Except.   She gathers all the courage it takes to say...}
<CHAR>__{WAVEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Except a necklace.}
<ACTION>__{And waits. We can feel her heart pounding in her throat.       Bunny stares back with eyes no one could read. And then...}
<CHAR>__{BUNNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I got a box of 'em.   You could pick one.}
<ACTION>__{A hush over this bay.   A woman stunned and grateful.}
<CHAR>__{BUNNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then you'd have everything you need.}
<ACTION>__{Well, that seems true. So, the woman nods.       Her eyes flutter down. In the silence, she unwraps a sandwich...}
<CHAR>__{WAVEY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(a murmur)}
<DIAL>__{You want the cheese?}
<CHAR>__{BUNNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<ACTION>__{Okay, then. She hands that one to Quoyle.       And as she and Bunny look for another, we PULL... ...UP and AWAY, an AERIAL ANGLE swirling above the shimmering bay. The boat so far below us. The people tiny specks. They could be anyone. Anyone at all.}
