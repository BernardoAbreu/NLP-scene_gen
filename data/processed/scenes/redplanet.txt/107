<A>__{conversation's over. gallagher walks towards the rock }
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{we should get outta here.}
<A>__{pettengill doesn't respond.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{really. we should get going...}
<A>__{gallagher walks over. we hear a familiar whine. don't recognize what it is at first. until gallagher around the rock and sees... pettengill's flicked on the whizzing cutting edge of the entrenching tool. shreds his left wrist. lifts it and rips through his carotid arteries. all but cuts off his head as he falls to the ground. suit's awash with blood. overflowing onto the ground and him. burbling in spurts. some hits the worms.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{jesus...jesus god...}
<A>__{burchenal's joined him. there's nothing they could do. only watch in shock. it gets worse. the worms come. pulsating and undulating towards pettengill. as if some secret message the food is here has spread through the billions of them in burst of knowledge. a diaphanous, hungry wave crests onto pettengill and engulfs him. he's covered in translucence as they devour him. gallagher and burchenal stagger backwards in horror as a red aureole grows around him as he's eaten. color spreads out around him in a perfect ever growing circle. it's a feast.}
<B>__{wide}
<A>__{the two of them walk along. can't tell if they're hurrying towards something or away. they've both figured out what's up. a beat, then }
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{he killed santen.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{probably figured we were gonna die anyhow.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{yep. figured wrong. for now.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<P>__{(beat; then)}
<D>__{nobody deserves to die like that.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{no.}
