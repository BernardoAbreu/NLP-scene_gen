<L>__{interior dressing room later}
<A>__{julianne sits on the loveseat in her bra and panties, lighting one cigarette from the butt of another. suddenly, she hears... ... an argument outside the door. strains to listen. it does sound like michael and kim. we can't make out the words. she jumps up, dashes for the door, stubbing her toe on the platform, shit!, falls heavily against the door with a thud that makes her wince, and... ... the argument stops. damn. she opens the door a crack. sees nothing. opens it wider to reveal... ... a teenaged boy looking right at her. he sends a true shit eating grin and she slams the door hard enough to rattle walls. she paces furiously, helplessly, arms around her half naked self, until... ... soft knock. the door opens a crack, and her daffodil gown comes through it.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{come in, and shut the...}
<A>__{stops. because it's michael who has entered. with the dress.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{... door.}
<A>__{so he does. she flushes and snatches up her own clothes, which were characteristically tangled in a heap, and tries desperately to untangle them enough to cover herself. he is amazed and amused by her embarrassment.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{should i turn around, or someth...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{michael, i'm in my underwear!}
<A>__{she's tearing at her clothes, only making more of a mess.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{we've seen each other a lot more naked than this.}
<A>__{she seems ready to rip her clothes apart, so he gently takes them from her hands. she tries to stand unselfconsciously as he easily untangles them.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i mean, we were skinny dipping in greece, just as pals, less than two years ago.}
<A>__{she grabs the clothes and covers the front of herself. looking at him with a mix of emotions she couldn't begin to sort out.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{things are different now.}
<A>__{he looks in her eyes. and nods, a little sadly. guess they are.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{well. i leave with two thoughts in my mind.}
<A>__{he walks to the door. puts his hand on the latch. looks back...}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{you're still a very pretty girl.}
<A>__{the look holds. and holds. there is such feeling on both sides, she doesn't know what to make of it. she swallows.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{what's the sec...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{mirrors.}
<A>__{and he's gone. she looks around at six different views of her uncovered backside. hmm.}
