<L>__{interior gotham globe city room day}
<A>__{vicki arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down. she spots a message in the "in" file. she takes one look at it, and her eyes go wide with rage. she storms out in a fury...}
<L>__{interior publisher's office a minute later day}
<A>__{barging past a phalanx of secretaries, vicki bursts into the inner office of harrison j. provost, publisher of the globe. he's just opening his mail. he heaves a weary sigh as vicki barks at him:}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{why did you kill my story?}
<C>__{provost}
<D>__{close the door.}
<P>__{(waiting for her to calm down)}
<D>__{your story isn't news. with shaw dead }
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{but the project's still going ahead! if attacking homeless people in the park isn't news, i'd like to know what is }
<C>__{provost}
<D>__{there's a psycho out there in a mask and cape killing off gotham's most prominent citizens! that's news.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i've known randall shaw all my life. his family is in mourning. and it just so happens i don't believe in slandering the dead.}
<A>__{vicki fumes. she turns and stares provost straight in the eye.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{mr. provost how much money do you have tied up in the park tower project?}
<C>__{provost}
<D>__{vicki...i'm going to forget you made that remark. for the sake of your job, i suggest you do the same.}
<A>__{vicki stalks of and provost goes back to his mail. he finds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with the word "confidential" underlined three times in ink. he tears it open and his face turns pale as he stares down at the contents: a small business sized card, signed with a bat emblem...}
<B>__{those who feed on the soul of gotham will suffer my wrath}
