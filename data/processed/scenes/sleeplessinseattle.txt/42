<D>__{do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? maybe even more?}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{it's hard to imagine.}
<A>__{and cut back and forth between the car and the houseboat. sam and jonah are still on the bench, but jonah has fallen asleep in sam's lap. sam is stroking the boy's hair.}
<C>__{dr. marcia fieldstone }
<D>__{what are you going to do, sam?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't know. when i met my wife, it was so clear. i just knew.}
<A>__{annie is listening now.}
<C>__{dr. marcia fieldstone }
<D>__{what was it that made you know?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't think i could really describe it.}
<C>__{dr. marcia fieldstone }
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and if i could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.}
<P>__{(he laughs to himself)}
<D>__{but what the hell. it's not one specific thing. it's more of a feeling.}
<P>__{(continued)}
<A>__{annie coasts to a stop outside a handsome mansion in washington, d.c., the motor running. she's hooked now, she's not getting out of the car until she's heard it all.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home. it's almost like...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{magic.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{magic.}
<B>__{closer on annie}
<A>__{realizing she has just said this. realizing that it must mean something but not knowing what. she's crying.}
<C>__{dr. marcia fieldstone }
<D>__{well, it's time to wrap up, folks }
<A>__{a figure appears at the passenger side window, which annie doesn't notice. she's wiping the tears away with her hand.}
<C>__{dr. marcia fieldstone }

<C>__{walter}
<D>__{annie?}
<A>__{she turns. he's pointing at the locked door. she searches for the button. finally finds it so that walter can open the door.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i'm sorry, walter. i just heard the most amazing thing on the radio.}
<A>__{they start toward the front door, walter and annie carrying presents, an overnight bag of annie's.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{people call up these shows and you can't believe the stuff they say. it's the end of privacy as we know it, this country is just one big global village with everyone out there going blah blah blah }
<A>__{as they enter the house, we hear silent night and we see a christmas tree, glittering with lights.}
