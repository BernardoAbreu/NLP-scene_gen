<C>__{munro}
<D>__{don't worry, sir. i have the perfect one.}
<L>__{interior korben's apartment day}
<A>__{c.u. the most disgusting dessert ever made. korben looks at it shimmying on a plate as the thai serves it to him proudly.}
<C>__{thai}
<D>__{stewed jellyfish cake.. my speciality..}
<A>__{korben forces a weak, polite smile as the thai looks on expectantly. the phone rings.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{saved by the bell.}
<A>__{korben rises to get his cigarettes, and answer the phone.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{...hello?}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{you're the nastiest dirtbag i know in this stinking city!}
<C>__{korben}
<P>__{(resigned)}
<D>__{hi ma...}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{i've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years i've been eating those shitty croquettes.}
<A>__{korben goes to light his cigarette. there are only two matches left in the match box. korben strikes one and it fizzles.}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{you wouldn't even eat one to help your poor mother, and you win the big prize? know something? the whole thing makes me sick!}
<A>__{the thai starts to clean up. just as korben goes to strike the second match..}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{are you listening to me, you ingrate!}
<C>__{korben}
<P>__{(resigned)}
<D>__{yes ma..}
<A>__{korben sighs and puts the match back in the box. korben enters his code on the keypad the thai is holding.}
<C>__{korben}
<P>__{(to the thai)}
<D>__{go on... this is gonna take a while!}
<A>__{the thai casts oft. korben closes the window.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{other than that... you all right?}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{...and now you're making fun of me? i'm warning you! if you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, i will never forgive you!!}
<A>__{the thai flies off. in the hall, the cat meows for more food.}
<C>__{korben}
<P>__{(to the cat)}
<D>__{i'm coming!. ma, what're you talking about?}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{i get it! you want to make me beg, is that it?}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{all i want is an explanation! i just got in, i lost my job. i smashed my cab. i got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, ma, thanks for asking!! now settle down and explain to me calmly..}
<A>__{a message drops in his tube. the red light goes on.}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{you just won a trip, you dolt! ten days in fhloston paradise for two!}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{ma. if i'd won, i'd know about it. someone would have notified me.}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{they've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!}
<A>__{he eyeballs the message still in the tube. the doorbell rings. }
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{ma.. it's the door. i will call you back.}
<A>__{korben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the door. before he gets there it opens, general munro enters followed by a captain and a major. major iceborg is a woman. all she needs to become a man is a mustache. munro opens a file.}
<C>__{munro}
<P>__{(clipped)}
<D>__{major dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the federal army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{what mission?}
<C>__{munro}
<D>__{to save the world.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{where have i heard this song before?}
<C>__{munro}
<D>__{you're to leave immediately for fhloston paradise. retrieve four stones from the diva plavalaguna. and bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. any questions'?}
<C>__{korben}
<P>__{(a little bewildered)}
<D>__{just one... why me?}
<C>__{munro}
<D>__{three reasons... one: as part of the elite special forces unit of the federated army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.}
<A>__{munro pulls out a long list of documents.}
<C>__{munro}
<D>__{two: of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{and the third one?}
<C>__{munro}
<D>__{you're the only one left alive...}
<A>__{munro removes the message korben hasn't bothered to look at.}
<C>__{munro}
<D>__{don't you open your messages?}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{i've had enough good news for today}
<C>__{munro}
<P>__{(by rote)}
<D>__{you have won the annual gemini contest and a trip to fhloston paradise. for two. congratulations. here are your tickets.}
<A>__{he hands korben the tickets. korben gets it.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{you rigged the contest?}
<A>__{munro nods.}
<C>__{munro}
<D>__{major iceborg will accompany you... as your wife...}
<A>__{the idea of taking a trip with iceborg makes him sick.}
<C>__{korben}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{you couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?}
<C>__{munro}
<D>__{old tricks are the best tricks eh?}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{i'm not going.}
<C>__{munro}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{one reason... i want to stay the only one left alive.}
