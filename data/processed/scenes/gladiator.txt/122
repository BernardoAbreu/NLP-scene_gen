<L>__{exterior colosseum arena day}
<A>__{a trap door springs open and the elevator platform rises to the sand of the arena. maximus stands above the dead emperor. the crowd stares in amazement and then begins to cheer in joy at the return of their hero. a chant begins... "maximus the merciful... maximus the merciful... maximus the merciful..." which then grows to a refrain of "caesar... caesar... caesar..." maximus ignores them, his eyes drawn to one sight: lucilla. he goes to the steps of the platform leading to the imperial box. he slowly climbs the steps. in the imperial box, senator gracchus is standing. so too juba and others. lucius is kneeling by his mother, holding her hand, his head down. lucilla is dead. lucius mourns with quiet dignity. maximus looks at lucilla and kneels. he takes her other hand. a long moment. he looks at lucius. then he slowly bends forward and kisses lucilla deeply, the ritual farewell. he stands. senator gracchus steps to him:}
<C>__{gracchus}
<D>__{general, the purple is yours if you so desire. the senate will support you.}
<A>__{maximus looks at him. and then at the people. the chant of "caesar... caesar... caesar..." is like a powerful beating heart. maximus moves to the edge of the imperial box to address the people. the crowd grows silent. maximus looks around at the blood of the arena.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{rome... you are better than this. look inside yourselves. i challenge you to find your true voice. help the senate speak for you. make them your champion... and dare to think what could be.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i give you back the dream.}
<A>__{with that he slowly turns and walks down the steps to the arena sand. the crowd is absolutely silent. he goes to titus:}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{when everything has calmed down, lead an orderly withdrawal. take them home.}
<A>__{titus salutes. maximus return the salute and then leaps onto his horse. as he canters toward the exit he turns for one final look at lucilla. he sees that lucius is now at the foot of the stairs, on the arena sand, gazing at him. maximus stops his horse. he canters back to lucius. the boy looks up at him. a moment between them. lucius thrusts up his hand. maximus grabs his hand and swings him onto the horse behind him. a look to juba. juba bows his head with respect. farewell. maximus spins the horse around and begins cantering out of the colosseum. juba disappears into the crowd. maximus and lucius canter across the arena and through the huge doors...}
