<A>__{sissy and jelly lie under the same stars, under the same blankets. under the same spell.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{every time i tell you that i love you, you flinch. but that's your problem.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{if i flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. my confusion becomes your confusion. students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....}
<L>__{exterior campfire night}
<A>__{delores and some of the other cowgirls are talking. a sharp wind is beginning to gust.}
<C>__{delores}
<D>__{it isn't for ourselves that we take this stand. it isn't for cowgirls. it's for all the daughters everywhere. this is an extremely important confrontation. this is womankind's chance to prove to her enemy that she's willing to fight and die. if we women don't show here and now that we aren't afraid to fight and die, then our enemy will never take us seriously. men will always know that, no matter how strong our words and determined our deeds, there's a point where we'll back down and give them their way.}
<A>__{delores cracks her whip then parades around the campfire.}
<C>__{delores}
<D>__{i'm prepared to win! victory for every female, living or dead, who's suffered the temporary defeats of masculine insensitivity to their inner lives!}
<A>__{a few of the cowgirls cheer.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{i will fight the bastards.}
<A>__{big red opens a can of beans with a bowie knife.}
<C>__{big red}
<D>__{i will fight 'em with bean gas, if necessary.}
<A>__{delores snaps her whip again.}
<C>__{delores}
<D>__{the sun's going down. let's those of us not standing watch get some sleep. in the morning we'll plan our fight. tomorrow afternoon those of you who'd like can join me in the reeds, where the cranes and i will be sharing the last crumbs left in the peyote sack.}
