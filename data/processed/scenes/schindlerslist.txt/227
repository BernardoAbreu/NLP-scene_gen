<L>__{interior factory night}
<A>__{in the machine tool section, a "judicial table" has been set up. at it sit schindler, liepold, two other ss officers, and an attractive german girl, a stenographer. the "saboteur," the boy, janek, stands before the court.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{i'm unfamiliar with the hilo machines. i don't know why i was assigned there.}
<A>__{commandant liepold was watching me trying to figure it out. i switched it on and it blew up. i didn't do anything. all i did was turn it on. gone tonight is schindler's usual shop floor familiarity. he studies the boy solemn faced.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{if you're not skilled at armaments work, you shouldn't be here.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{i'm a lathe operator.}
<A>__{schindler dismisses the defensive comment with a wave of his hand and gets up. he comes around and paces slowly before the boy. eventually, janek dares to speak again }
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{sir?}
<A>__{schindler glances up at him distractedly.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{i did adjust the pressure controls.}
<A>__{schindler stops, looks to the panel, and back to the boy.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{i know that much about them. somebody had set the pressure controls wrong. i had to adjust }
<A>__{schindler slams the back of his hand so hard across janek's face, the boy almost falls. he's stunned. so are the others at the table. they've never seen such violence from the direktor. he roars }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{the stupidity of these people. i wish they were capable of sabotaging a machine.}
<A>__{schindler's hand comes up again and janek recoils, expecting another blow. schindler manages to hold it.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{get him out of my sight.}
<A>__{a guard escorts the prisoner away. the panel members glance among themselves. is that it? schindler faces them and groans in dismay.}
