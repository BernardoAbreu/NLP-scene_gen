<D>__{car?}
<A>__{no response. the cordless phone continues to ring. jimmy leans over from his chair and waves a hand in front of car. nothing. jimmy jumps up from his recliner. he stares at car. he steps over, takes two fingers and checks car's pulse. he stands back, unsure of what to do. hesitant, jimmy walks over to a closet, opens the door, and slides a gym bag out into the room. he opens the gym bag and pulls out a large bag of marijuana and a few jars of k. he throws them into his backpack, zips up the gym bag, and puts it back into the closet. jimmy exits through the sliding glass doors.}
