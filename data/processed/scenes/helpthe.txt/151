<C>__{celia }
<D>__{i've wanted to talk to you all night. minny told me why you won't be my friend. you think me and johnny went behind your back.}
<C>__{hilly}

<D>__{i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{hilly}
<P>__{(gritted teeth)}
<D>__{what are you trying to do to me? what are you and that nigra up to?}

<C>__{celia}
<D>__{i don't know what you }
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{ you liar! who did you tell?!}
<A>__{jolene loses her place on the list. the room grows quiet but celia is still yelling.}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{hilly, i got pregnant after you and johnny broke up!}
<A>__{the room echoes with celia's words. across the room, women's noses wrinkle.}
<C>__{missus walters}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{shut up, mother.}
<A>__{stuart belts out with a laugh. skeeter pinches his arm. celia is mortified. sweat beads on her forehead.}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{johnny never cheated on you...at least, not with me.}
<A>__{celia starts to breathe heavily. her eyes start to water.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{johnny would never }
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{and i'm sorry i thought you'd be tickled to win that pie.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{you tell that nigra if she tells anybody, i will make her suffer.}
<A>__{horrified, skeeter catches eyes with minny and aibileen. they all immediately look away. johnny makes his way over. celia holds her breath, shaking her head back and forth.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{celia, what's wrong, honey?}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{uh oh.}
<A>__{celia leans over and vomits on the fleur de lis print carpet. the entire room gasps in horror.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{oh, shit!}
<A>__{johnny tries to pull celia back. she pushes johnny away and runs for the bathroom. he follows. hilly marches over to aibileen who is standing nearby.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{get that cleaned up before it starts to smell.}
<C>__{aibileen}
