<L>__{interior penthouse hallway same}
<A>__{plaster and debris everywhere, sprinklers tripped, most of mustache's team shot, shredded or burnt to a crisp. pieces of building and bodies either waterlogged or fully ablaze. mustache and darwin play duck and cover, exchanging fire. jeeves, out of grenades, sledgehammer swinging, crushing wall studs, scattering remaining security team members. ivy, sheltered, having survived the opening salvos, gets ahold of a gun from a chainsaw shorn former security member; lester sees ivy arming himself, blitzes him chainsaw snarling, revved out, sending fantails of gristle and chipped bone everywhere. less than fifteen feet separate them. ivy fires, shots deflected off the blade's teeth, seconds from getting gutted he adjusts his aim high, emptying the gun into lester's chest, bullets blazing haywire, blowing out between lester's shoulders, stopping a hard charge cold. lester, lopsided, bullet dazed, drools blood...then dies. ivy dumps his clip, searches for another the chainsaw falls, stalls. jeeves, hefting the sledgehammer like a hayseed john henry, looks over as his older brother's life come to an end. he reacts badly.}

<A>__{jeeves buries the sledge in a wall, takes up the chainsaw, rips the pullcord, resumes the charge ivy, finds a clip, slams it in the stock, points, pulls trigger stick, hammer jam. he falls to his back, scurrying away, trouble finding traction, soles slipping he keeps pulling the trigger. jeeves straddles him from above, raises the saw like a great wooden stake, about to bring it down bam! ivy's automatic discharges. the round splits the saw's gas tank, spritzing fuel, dousing jeeves a beat before the tank suddenly arcs, exploding, lighting jeeves up like a four hundred pound bonfire, bouncing him off the walls; a human hindenberg, fully engulfed. he flails, burns, howls, falls...molten fat melts off his body like lard butter... darwin, dismayed, both brothers down...he moves on mustache, dispatches him with detached efficiency, snapping his neck clean. he then starts toward ivy, who's trying desperately to crawl out of there.}
