<A>__{buffy moves quickly along, crouching near a window and peering out. nothing. she looks about her, waiting for an attack. she checks her purse. angle buffy's purse cosmetics and hair spray. a small cross. no stakes left. muttering under her breath, she moves swiftly into a classroom.}

<L>__{interior classroom same time}
<A>__{still moving cautiously, she heads for the window and pulls down the shade. she crouches behind the teacher's desk and pulls the chair down to her, laying it on its side.}
<C>__{benny}
<P>__{(cattily, to herself)}
<D>__{'ooh, make me a woman, jeffrey... oh, jeffrey, you're so atheletical... i love you...'}
<A>__{she slams her elbow down on the chair leg very controlled, efficient motion and snaps it off. looks around to see if anyone is around to hear as she picks up the leg, now a weapon. she goes softly to the door, peers cautiously out. closeup buffy looking out. amilyn's face appears right next to her, also looking out.}
<C>__{amilyn}
<D>__{all clear?}
<A>__{buffy screams, turns, and amilyn decks her, sends her flying back into the classroom. the stake flies out of her hand. it lands on a desk by the window. buffy does not land nearly as well, crashing into a pile of desks and twisting her leg badly. amilyn laughs repulsively, advancing.}
<C>__{amilyn}
<D>__{pleased to meet you! won't you guess my }
<P>__{(kicks her hard)}
<D>__{ name?}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(defiantly, through the pain)}
<D>__{it wouldn't be 'dick,' would it?}
<A>__{he kicks her again.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{'lefty'?}
<C>__{amilyn}
<D>__{you're a fool, bloodbag. die a fool and go to hell!}
<A>__{he grabs her by the neck with his one arm and pins her against the wall in the corner. she reaches for the stake but it is just out of reach. he is squeezing the life out of her, his face inches from hers.}
<C>__{amilyn}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the chosen one. you're just another bloodbag not even fit to die for the master. when will you ever learn?}
<A>__{buffy looks about for succor. angle the window shade buffy eyes the bottom of the shade, the pull dangling aimlessly.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(with difficulty)}
<D>__{i do know... one thing...}
<C>__{amilyn}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i know... what time sunrise is.}
<A>__{she pulls down hard on the shade pull and lets go.}
<C>__{amilyn}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{he turns in horror, letting go of buffy, trying to catch the shade. the instant he releases her, buffy grabs the stake and in one swift motion, buries it in amilyn's back. the shade goes up, flapping loudly as it spins. it is still pitch black out. amilyn stare, wide eyed and silent, at the night as he dies.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{it's in about four hours, dick.}
<A>__{amilyn spins, dying rage in his eyes. he grabs her. his strength is formidable even as his body begins to smoke. suddenly screaming, he forces her over suddenly with such power that the two of them go crashing through the floorboards.}
