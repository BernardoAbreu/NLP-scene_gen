<A>__{starks and jackie sit opposite dr. morgan, the current young face of the hospital. morgan has a boyish face and a matching gullibility.}
<C>__{dr. morgan}
<D>__{i'm sorry i can't tell you more about your father's death, mr. starks. our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the alpine grove's staff changed and i'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{his body was found on january 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?}
<C>__{dr. morgan}
<D>__{no, i don't. i'm sorry. i wish i knew more.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{what about dr. thomas becker or dr. loel lorenson? there was also a dr. gries, i think.}
<C>__{dr. morgan}
<D>__{well, dr. lorenson is still here at the hospital. if she was here at the time your father was, then i'm sure she'd be of more help to you.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{what about dr. becker and mr. gries?}
<C>__{dr. morgan}
<D>__{unfortunately, i'm not familiar with dr. becker and dr. gries passed away three, four years ago.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{do you have any kind of forwarding address for dr. becker?}
<C>__{dr. morgan}
<D>__{your father was here 12 years ago. i doubt the hospital would have that, if dr. becker is still even alive. [beat, a little suspiciously] is there a particular reason you need to know how your father died?}
<A>__{starks doesn't waver when he answers.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{he was the only family i remember. dr. morgan [nodding] i will see what i can find out about dr. becker. and maybe dr. lorenson will know something.}
