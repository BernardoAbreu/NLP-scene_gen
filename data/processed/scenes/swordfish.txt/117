<A>__{closeup fly fishing reel as it quickly unwinds.}
<L>__{exterior river morning}
<A>__{reisman, dressed in your average, fly fishing garb, stands in the shallow water of a wide river, thinking he has contained the situation, is doing what he enjoys most. he rewinds the reel and flicks it out again; the hook sails into the distance. a huge cohiba cigar hangs from his satisfied grin. faintly, we hear the whine of machinery. jim hears it, too, odd since we are so far in the boonies. he looks around, then up and we push in to a closeup. reisman's pov an evil looking, camouflaged gunship suddenly crests the hill directly above him, rotors thumping.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{reisman ducking, his cigar falling from his mouth, has to fight to hold on to his ridiculous fishing hat.}
<B>__{angle from above helicopter}
<A>__{water sprays everywhere as it hovers. slowly it drifts over to the bank and lowers where it touches down briefly, the side door slides open. angle (slow motion) as gabriel steps out and walks toward us. the copter lifts off behind him.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{reisman drops his rod and digs into the fishing box at his right. gabriel saunters toward him as the helicopter disappears over the rise. reisman is not happy.}

<P>__{(sniffing in air)}
<D>__{ahh, the great american outdoors. i will never understand the appeal of fly fishing, jim. a little too much like masturbation for me, without the payoff.}
<A>__{gabriel looks around, suddenly realizing something.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{this's a catch and release stream, isn't it?}
<C>__{reisman}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{gabriel starts to laugh. reisman doesn't catch the joke.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{oh c'mon, jim. you gotta see the irony in the chairman of the joint sub committee on crime, fishing in a catch and release stream.}
<A>__{closeup reisman grimaces, not thinking it is funny.}
<B>__{wider}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{how could you do it, jim? after all we have sacrificed. all the blood, all the death... i've changed my identity so many times, i don't even know what i look like anymore. how could you turn on me when we are so close?}
<C>__{reisman}
<D>__{you did this to yourself.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you brought me in to get the job done and you didn't want to know about the consequences.}
<C>__{reisman}
<D>__{the f.b.i. was watching you }
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i told you there was nothing that i was unaware of }
<C>__{reisman}
<D>__{that's why we're here. you are too arrogant, too aggressive }
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you have misplaced your loyalties, senator. you have sold america out. i am a patriot, and patriotism does not have a four year shelf life. unfortunately, politicians do.}
<A>__{gabriel pulls out his h&k, dangling it by his side.}
<C>__{reisman}
<P>__{(arrogantly)}
<D>__{and what are you going to do with that?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{thomas jefferson once shot a man on the white house lawn for treason, senator. you tried to execute me in the name of politics, now i execute you in the name of the people.}
<A>__{gabriel shoots reisman in the chest. he falls into the water.}
