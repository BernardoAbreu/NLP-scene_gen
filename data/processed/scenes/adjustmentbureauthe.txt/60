<L>__{interior warehouse day}
<A>__{reveal burdensky, a 50 year old in a pin stripe suit, carrying a briefcase. he walks to richardson.}
<C>__{burdensky}
<D>__{re setting's off the table. this is our fault...}
<A>__{richardson glances irately at harry, who stands by himself off to the side, clearly disgraced. david, who is tied to a chair facing away from richardson, cranes around to see who's talking.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{the suits stare back in silence for a beat, then turn back to talking amongst themselves though at a lower volume.}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{what are my options?}
<C>__{burdensky}
<P>__{(ignoring david)}
<D>__{you could bullshit him but you'll never be completely successful.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{can somebody tell me what's going on?}
<C>__{burdensky}
<P>__{(still ignoring him)}
<D>__{the questions will burn in him till the day he dies. you'll have to monitor him constantly...}
<C>__{on david}
<D>__{he can hear little snippets of what burdensky's saying }
<C>__{burdensky }
<D>__{to make sure he doesn't talk... the endless ripple effects...}
<A>__{reveal david untying the rope restraining him.}
<B>__{on the suits}
<C>__{burdensky}
<D>__{if it were me, i'd level with him. ric:hardson completely?}
<C>__{burdensky}
<D>__{that's the only way to extinguish his curiosity.}
<A>__{richardson turns and studies david. then walks over to him. an uncomfortable pause.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{who are you guys?}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{we're the people v ho make sure things happen according to plan.}
<A>__{david stares back at him for a moment. then leaps up. his rope comes off and the chair falls. he sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse. richardson makes a little gesture with his hand close up of the floor it cracks... and displaces upward... so it's uneven just as david's foot comes down on it.}
<B>__{back to wide shot}
<A>__{david trips and goes flying }
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{david is dragged back to the center of the room and placed back in his chair in front of richardson.}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{did you really think i couldn't see that coming?}
<A>__{david dabs blood from his lip, which split during the fall.}
<C>__{richardson }
<D>__{i can read your mind!}
<A>__{david stares back.}
<C>__{richardson }
<D>__{yeah, really...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{choose a color.}
<P>__{(barely a beat)}
<D>__{blue. choose a number.}
<P>__{(even less time)}
<D>__{seventeen.}
<A>__{david's jaw drops slightly. richardson was clearly right.}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{now, why are you still deciding whether or not to run?}
<A>__{david's hands go to his head`, involuntarily, an atavistic response, as if somehow that will keep his thoughts from spilling out into view.}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{you saw the futility of that back at the office.}
<A>__{david's entire reality has finally been bent to the breaking pointerior he can't hang on any longer to an explanation for all this based in the world he's known to date...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what the hell is happening to me?}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{you just saw behind a curtain you weren't even supposed to know was there, mr. norris. its jarring. i'm sure.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i just... came to work...}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{it wasn't your fault. your path through the world this morning was supposed to be adjusted.}
<P>__{(glancing bitterly at harry, in the corner)}
<D>__{your coffee was supposed to.spill onto your shirt as you left starbucks near your apartment. you would have gone up to change and arrived at work ten minutes later than you did. by then we would have left.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{people call it "chance" when their coffee spills or their internet goes down or they misplace their keys. sometimes it is. sometimes it's us... nudging you back on plan. david takes all this in. he's still shell shocked.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{whatever you were doing to charlie back there... it wasn't misplacing his keys.}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{sometimes. when nudging a person back on plan isn't enough we intervene directly.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why charlie? what did you do to him.}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{you need to worry about getting back on your plan, david, not worry about us putting him back on his.}
<A>__{david stares back, still trying to get his bearings.}
<C>__{richardson }
<D>__{only a handful of human beings know what you now know, david. we're determined to keep it that way. so before i let you go, you need to understand something: if you ever reveal our existence we will erase your brain. your memories, your emotions, your entire personality will be expunged. your friends and family will think you've gone crazy. you won't "think" anything because a blank slate can't "think."}
<A>__{david stares back.}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{do you understand what i just said?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{not a word. not one word about us.}
<P>__{(long beat as he studies david's face)}
<D>__{okay .... you're free to go.}
<A>__{david stands there a moment... not sure it's real. richardson points at the door. david walks toward it. just then another man comes up to richardson.}
<C>__{new man in suit}
<D>__{there's a woman.}
<C>__{richardson}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{there's always & woman...}
<A>__{richardson motions to his men.}
<B>__{at the door}
<A>__{two men come through from outside and block david's exit.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{he said i could go.}
<B>__{center of room}
<C>__{new man in suit}
<D>__{you won't believe who she is.}
<A>__{he holds open a planbook for richardson to see.}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{how is that possible? why didn't we get an alert?}
<C>__{new man in suit}
<D>__{he wasn't supposed to be on that bus. he was supposed to be changing his shirt in his apartment... it was a controlled situation. it was supposed to be.}
<A>__{the new man looks at harry.}
<B>__{at the door}
<A>__{david looks back at richardson.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you said i could go.}
<A>__{richardson walks over to him.}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{you ran into a woman named elise on the bus this morning?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(going very still)}
<D>__{why does it matter?}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{you weren't ever supposed to see her again.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why do you care.?}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{because, david, you can't be with her. and we didn't want to have to resort to this }
<A>__{four big guys grab david and pull his arms backwards like prison guards incapacitating a prisoner. richardson reaches into david's pocket and pulls out his wallet }
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what the hell what are you }
<A>__{richardson removes the piece of paper that elise wrote her number on from david's wallet }
<C>__{david }
<D>__{no richardson places the wallet back in david's pocket, then pulls out a lighter }
<C>__{david }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{and burns elise's number. david strains and tries to pull loose from the vice like grip of the four intervention team men. but he can't get free.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{what is wrong with you people?!}
<A>__{richardson drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn. on david's reaction cut to:}
