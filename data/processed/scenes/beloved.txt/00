<A>__{it is winter in ohio. a house sits isolated beside a barren field. the field stretches beyond, until a line of distant woods stops it. around the back of the house stands a rundown storage shed, a cold house, a privy and a water pump. a porch with a single door serves as the only entrance. camera begins a slow move toward the house as we; super ohio, 1865 we hear sounds from inside the house bumps, a chair falling over...and feet running on wooden floor boards.}
