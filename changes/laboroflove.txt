An arch of ORANGE AND RED FLARES outlines the area of shattered glass and twisted metal. We are at the site of a gruesome car accident.  An ambulance and four police cars are on the scene.  Two cars are involved in the crash.  The first, a SILVER CADILLAC with its front caved in a perfect semi-circle; there is no-one inside the car. The second car is a different story entirely.  A DARK GREEN HONDA PRELUDE crushed against the concrete median that separates the South-bound lanes from the North-bound lanes. All the windows have imploded.  The original seventeen foot length of the car, compressed to ten.  The hood has folded back into the front seat.  This car is not empty!  Through the sliver that used to be a window, WE SEE a female hand, purple, swollen and bloody. Some drivers have stopped their cars on the shoulder and have walked over to the flares.  A set of cops wave them back.}

Adelle is Maurice's niece, early thirties, very attractive and always smiling -- except at this moment. Ted begins another one of his stories -- the words are incoherent as Maurice watches Adelle carefully... Adelle turns her back to the room as she talks and then DISAPPEARS into the kitchen stretching the phone cord around the doorway... Something is definitely wrong. Maurice steadies his gaze at the door of the kitchen... eternal seconds pass before Adelle appears again.  She looks different -- ghostly.  She glances up for a fraction of a second locking eyes with her uncle -- she immediately looks away. Maurice watches Adelle move to her husband GERALD and whispers in his ear.  Gerald changes instantly -- taking on the same ghostly transformation -- his eyes dart to Maurice. Ted's story is cut off as Maurice speaks LOUDLY...}
