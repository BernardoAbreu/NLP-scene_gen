<L>__{interior high rise tim's door night}
<A>__{stephen and tim creep along the hall.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(to tim)}
<D>__{lotta smoke, but it isn't rolling... that means it's hiding... staying sleepy... one of these doors...}
<A>__{tim's come to one.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{easy... no hurry... you're not going anywhere...}
<A>__{stephen bangs down another door. sticks his head in to check. a little woodpecker toy dips up and down in a glass of water. tim readies his axe before his door, gathers his courage as stephen comes out of the room he was checking. sees tim lifting his axe.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{did you check the door for heat, tim?}
<A>__{tim doesn't hear. the axe is already up.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{tim?}
<A>__{tim's committed now, coming hard at the door. and stephen sees it for just an instant small tendrils of smoke edging lazily around the door then being sucked back in.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{tim!}
<A>__{he rushes for tim as tim's axe smacks the door and a whine behind it builds and roars and howls and tim's all follow through now, hitting the door with his shoulder as the door explodes outward, hurling tim against the opposite wall and for an instant he's okay but he freezes in terror as a shrieking tongue of flame shoots out the doorway and grindle shouts in horror and opens his hose line as the flames wrap tim like a jealous lover as adcox hears it and screams,}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{oh god! oh god no!}
<A>__{and tim's screaming now too, because his helmet, his mask, his face, it's all melting and grindle dives suicidally at the monster, blasting it with his hose as stephen ignores the flames and puts his arms around tim as grindle douses them both, killing the flames. the monster rolls wounded back into the room, into the air shafts as tim whimpers incoherently, sliding down the wall as stephen tries to help but oh god you can't tell what's face and what's mask and helmet anymore. grindle looks back where the fire came from. there's a corpse in there, burned and lying between two doors. adcox rushes to tim's side sobbing and it's the end, the end of the goddamn world...}
