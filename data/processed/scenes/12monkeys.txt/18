<L>__{interior engineering office an hour later (eternal night)}
<A>__{cole, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboard sketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.}
<C>__{astpophysicist}
<D>__{where you collected sample #4, what street was that?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{uh...}
<C>__{botanist}
<D>__{it's important to observe everything.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i think it was...i'm sure it was 2nd street.}
<A>__{as the scientists start to whisper animatedly among themselves, cole's eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the wall. one headline screams, "virus mutating!" another features a photo of an old man (dr. mason, who we'll see again later on) and the words, scientist says, "it's too late for cure".}
<C>__{astrophysicist's voice }
<D>__{close your eyes, cole.}
<A>__{startled, cole closes his eyes obediently. blackness. like cole, we see nothing. but we hear their voices.}
<C>__{engineer's voice }
<D>__{tell us in detail what you've seen in this room.}
<C>__{cole's voice }
<D>__{uh, in this room? uh...}
<C>__{microbiologist's voice }
<D>__{how many of us are there?}
<C>__{cole's voice }
<D>__{six...seven, if you count me.}
<C>__{astrophysicist's voice }
<D>__{tell us about the pictures on the wall...}
<C>__{cole's voice }
<D>__{uh, you mean the newspapers?}
<C>__{a montage of overlapping voices }
<D>__{tell us about the newspapers. can you hear my voice? what do i look like? what does he look like, the man who just spoke? how old were you when you left the surface?}
<A>__{the voices blur into a cacophony and fade into : the droning p.a. system at the airport.}
