<L>__{exterior cold mountain penitentiary establishing day}
<A>__{a depression era prison in the south. the prison truck sways down the rutted dirt road toward the main gate...}
<L>__{interior e block toilet day}
<A>__{...while paul edgecomb, early 40's, stands in a cramped toilet in his guard's uniform, trying to piss. his face is pained, his forehead beaded with sweat.}
<L>__{interior e block (the green mile) day}
<A>__{brutus howell(nicknamed "brutal" for his intimidating size, but he's actually rather thoughtful by nature) stands at the entry door of the cellblock, peering out through a viewing slot. he sees the prison truck arrive at the main gate. he turns and nods to fellow guard dean stanton sitting at the duty desk, then cross the green mile a wide corridor of faded green linoleum running some sixty paces top to bottom, with four large cells to a side. brutal steps to the bathroom, listen a moment, knocks softly.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{paul? prisoner.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{christ. gimme a minute.}
<A>__{brutal waits patiently, a bit embarrassed. he finally hears a thin trickle, accompanied by a stifled groan of pain.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{you all right in there?}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{for a man pissing razor blades.}
<A>__{the door opens, revealing paul's pale and sweaty face.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{you should'a took the day off, gone to see the doctor.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{with a new arrival? you know better. besides, it's not as bad as it was. i think it's clearing up.}
<A>__{they hear the truck honking as it rumbles up outside. paul gives them a nod to resume their positions. paul walks down the mile, passing the cells where two inmates reside the first is arlen bitterbuck, a washita cherokee; the second is eduard delacroix("del"), a skinny cajun.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{new boy coming in, boss?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{never you mind, del, you just keep your nose quietly on your business.}
<A>__{paul arrives at the end of the mile, takes up a position at an empty cell. (down at this end, past the cells, is e block's version of the "hole" a padded room where violent inmates are sent to cool off. it isn't used very often...in fact, at the moment, it's doubling as storage space.) brutal peers out the viewing slot as the truck stops outside.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{damn, they're riding on the axle. what'd they do, bust the springs?}
<A>__{guards percy wetmore and harry terwilliger of e block emerge from the back of the truck and step down, turn back... tighter angle on back of truck we get our first glimpse of the new inmate as a pair of gigantic black feet step down into the yard...and the rear of the truck bounces back up on its springs where it belongs. brutal sees what's coming, eyes widening slightly.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{paul? you might wanna reconsider getting in the cell with this guy?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{he's enormous.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{can't be bigger than you.}
<A>__{brutal tosses him a look just wait. he swings the door open in a hot flood of daylight, giving us our first good look at: john coffey is a huge black man, nearly 7 feet tall and 300 pounds, his massive head shiny and bald, his skin a tapestry of old scars, his prison overalls (the biggest size they had) ending at mid calf. he looks dull and confused, as if wondering where he is and how he got there. percy and harry lead him toward e block in shackles. percy's got his hickory baton out of it custom made holster, hollering:}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{dead man walking! dead man walking here!}
<A>__{inside the cellblock paul can't see them approach from where he stands, but he can certainly hear percy:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{jeezus, pleeze us, what the hell's he yelling about?}
<A>__{up by the door, brutal just rolls his eyes. percy is the first one through the door, still hollering...}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{dead man walking!}
<A>__{...then coffey enters, ducking low to get through, his shadow blotting out brutal and dean as his massive frame fills the door. everything hangs suspended for a moment, a look of "hold shit" written on everybody's faces. percy keeps yanking on the big man's cuffs, leading him along with a cry of:}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{dead man walking! dead man }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{percy, that's enough.}
<A>__{percy falls reproachfully silent. paul doesn't dignify it, just motions for them to come on. the procession comes down the mile, with brutal and dean bringing up rear.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{you sure you wanna be in there with him?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(looks to coffey)}
<D>__{am i gonna have trouble with you, big boy?}
<A>__{coffey shakes his head slowly. paul takes the clipboard transfer papers from harry, turns and enters the cell. coffey just stands outside the cell and waits, as if he doesn't understand the concept. paul motions him to come on in. coffey starts to comply, but percy raps him smartly with the tip of his hickory baton to get him moving faster. coffey flinches, enters the cell. paul stares angrily at percy, who stands slapping his hickory baton against the palm of his hand like a man with a toy he's itching to use.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{percy. they're moving house over in the infirmary. why don't you go see if they could use some help?}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{they got all the men they need.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{why don't you just go make sure?}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{i don't care where you go, percy, as long as it's not here at this very moment.}
<A>__{percy flushes red, the baton hovering near his palm. he looks like he's about to say something, but thinks better of it and stalks angrily up the mile instead... ...and sees del at his bars, smiling. infuriated, percy swings his baton and smashes del's fingers with a loud crack. del jerks back, howling in pain:}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{oww, god, he bus' my fingers!}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{wiped that grin off your shitpoke face, didn't i}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{goddamn it, percy! get the hell off my block!}
<A>__{percy throws paul a look of disdain your block, huh? he swaggers out. del's on his knees, weeping from the pain:}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{oww, damn, boss, he done bus' my fingers for true...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we'll get it looked at, del, now keep yourself quiet like i said!}
<A>__{del falls silent, moaning over his hand. paul turns to coffey, who looks unsettled by all the commotion.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{if i let harry take those chains off you, you gonna be nice?}
<A>__{coffey nods. harry enters to remove coffey's shackles.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{your name is john coffey.}
<C>__{coffey}
<P>__{(deep and quiet)}
<D>__{yes, sir, boss, like the drink, only not spelt the same.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{so you can spell, can you?}
<A>__{coffey shakes his head. harry steps out.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{my name is paul edgecomb. if i'm not here, you can ask for mr. terwilliger, mr. howell, or mr. stanton...those gentlemen there.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this isn't like the rest of the prison. it's a quiet place, we like to keep it that way.}
<A>__{coffey considers this carefully, puzzled.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{it weren't me making all the noise, boss.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(eyes narrowing)}
<D>__{you having a joke on me, john coffey?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<A>__{paul sees he isn't joking, continues:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{your time here can be easy or hard, depends on you. if you behave, you get to walk in the exercise yard every day. we might even play some music on the radio from time to time. questions?}
<A>__{coffey doesn't miss a beat, as if he's been waiting to ask:}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{do you leave a light on after bedtime?}
<A>__{paul blinks. it's the last thing he expected. coffey smiles uneasily, as if they might think him foolish for asking.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{because i get a little scared in the dark sometimes. if it's a strange place.}
<A>__{paul looks to his men. the guards are trading glances.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's pretty bright in here all night long. we keep half the lights burning in the corridor.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{cor'der.}
<A>__{coffey looks confused. paul points to the lights lining the ceiling of the green mile in wire mesh cages.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{right out there.}
<A>__{coffey nods, relieved. then he surprises everybody by offering paul his hand, as if to show proper manners. paul hesitates, oddly touched, then surprised his men even more by accepting. coffey's hand swallows his. coffey shakes gently, lets go. paul steps from the cell. brutal slides the door shut, locks it. coffey stands a moment as if unsure what to do, then sinks onto the cot with his hands clasped between his knees. he looks up at paul, his voice soft as a whisper:}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{couldn't help it, boss. i tried to take it back, but it was too late.}
<A>__{paul turns, leads his men up the mile... paul's inner office ...and they enter a few moments later. paul is furious, but keeping a lid on his temper:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{dean, run delacroix up to the infirmary and see if his fingers are broken.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{course they're broken, i heard the damn bones crack. goddamn percy.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you hear what he was yelling when we brought the big dummy in?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{how could i miss it, harry? the whole prison heard.}
<A>__{this makes brutal snort, breaking the tension the others can't help smiling.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{you'll probably have to answer for sending him off the mile. he's gonna cause you trouble over this, you mark me.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i will chew that food when i have to. right now i wanna hear about the new inmate...aside from how big he is, okay?}
<C>__{brutal}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{monstrous big. damn.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{seems meek enough. looks like they sent us an imbecile to execute.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{imbecile or not, he deserves to fry for what he done. here...}
<A>__{harry tosses a pair of manila envelopes bound with rubber bands on the desk before paul coffey's file.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{...make your blood curdle.}
