<L>__{interior club night}
<A>__{the music is part blues, part kurt weil, part gothic, dark and ominous as if the pianist knew exactly the sort of trouble jesse was in. the bar is comprised of elaborately carved chinese dragons, a tv mounted incongruously in the corner showing a silent vampire lestat video. couples dance cheek to cheek, rotating like figures on a music box. another couple is necking hot and heavy in the corner. jesse stares at the patrons of this vampire coven. many of the faces are unnaturally pale, gaunt. their eyes shine with a strange, reflective light. jesse moves through the tables, passing a mortal yuppie type sitting with a vampire girl he's obviously just met that night.}
<C>__{yuppie}
<D>__{wow. this is the coolest after hours club ever. you sure you don't want a drink?}
<C>__{vampire girl}
<D>__{soon.}
<A>__{the vampire girl smiles, glances up at jesse as she passes. jesse looks away quickly, moves on... the pianist watches as she passes by. the couple necking in the corner begins to get even more aroused. a mortal girl sips on her drink while her lover, a vampire, kisses her shoulder, her throat...}
<B>__{unknown pov}
<A>__{unaware that she is being watched, jesse continues her circuit.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{as jesse approaches the bar where three punk vampires slouch, looking up at lestat on the video.}
<B>__{unknown pov}
<A>__{we watch the punk vampires and hear every word they say as the other sounds fade away:}
<B>__{.}
<D>__{punk vampire #1 every coven's going...}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{reveal unknown pov. a vampire, face hidden behind a hood, seems extremely interested in what the punk vampires are saying.}
<B>__{back to punk vampires}
<A>__{a young girl dressed in goth gear sits down at the bar. punk vampire #1 turns and smiles insincerely at her as she stares up at lestat on the tv. getting a sudden chill, the goth girl takes her drink and moves back into the crowd as the vampire looks after her with murderous eyes.}
<B>__{jesse}
<A>__{reaches the punk vampires. they fall silent as she pauses at the bar. she turns, stares at the necking couple... jesse's pov ... a brief glimpse of the tiny trickle of blood on the mortal girl's neck as she swoons... an even briefer flash as her vampire lover comes up for air, his lips and teeth shiny with blood...}
<B>__{jesse}
<A>__{stares, horrified.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<P>__{punk vampire #1 (o.s.)}
<D>__{come here often?}
<A>__{jesse turns to see punk vampire #1 leaning towards her.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{sure, all the time.}
<A>__{the punk vampire pulls down her collar.}
<D>__{punk vampire #1 don't see any marks.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{you haven't seen the rest of my body. punk vampire #2 is that an invitation?}
<A>__{jesse finds herself surrounded by the three vampires. she shakes her head, too frightened to get out a response.}
<D>__{punk vampire #3 so, where's your host?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{my host... oh he's here somewhere.}
<A>__{she peers into the darkness, starts moving towards the door... finds herself blocked by punk vampire #2.}
<D>__{punk vampire #2 your host. what's his name?}
<A>__{jesse looks around, trying not to panic. pale faces, pale eyes stare at her. a long, terrible pause... suddenly }
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{marius...}
<B>__{hooded figure}
<A>__{leans forward, surprised, studies this strange mortal, fascinated.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<D>__{punk vampire #1 sorry. don't know the guy.}
<A>__{the punk vampires laugh. jesse desperately tries to cover her terror.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{marius has the blood of the ancients flowing in his veins. punk vampire #2 there aren't any ancients left. they all turned to dust...}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{that's a myth. marius is around here somewhere...}
<A>__{jesse again heads for the door. but punk vampire #1 has appeared in front of her. she stares at him, terrified.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{you... you really should meet him. punk vampire #1 and why is that?}
<A>__{jesse watches the other punk vampires slowly begin to close in on her. as she speaks, she slowly edges to the door...}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{because... because... he's wise, a philosopher... he asks the big questions. like how are you going to get through eternity? it's easier for us mortals. life is brief, but for you...}
<A>__{she inches toward the door, desperately stalling. their white faces gleam menacingly as they close in. she struggles to get the words out...}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i mean... what can you really do with immortality besides just slip from one day to the next, trapped in a void of meaninglessness, relieved only by your next victim? how do you not give in to despair and just wither away from boredom, hopelessness?}
<A>__{the punk vampires pause, staring at her, as her words sink in. the hooded figure leans forward revealing his face... it is lestat. he stares at jesse, amazed. jesse glances desperately at the door. it's just a few feet away now.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{you know, it's like they say the more things change, the more they stay the same. for you that's forever, right?}
<A>__{all around her, vampires are turning to look. the punk vampires stare at her, eyes narrowing. jesse is now inches from the door. she can barely breathe. punk vampire #1 gazes at her, his confusion suddenly turning to anger.}
<D>__{punk vampire #1 you know, you're really a downer...}
<A>__{he bares his fangs. jesse bolts out the door... pan across vampire faces staring after jesse to lestat who gazes at her, absolutely entranced. he watches the punk vampires head after jesse.}
