<L>__{exterior orphanage night}
<A>__{anya begins to climb down the street, testing the knots. the knotshold tight, but the old sheet rips in half, sending her plummeting into a snow drift. from the depths of the snow we hear her voice.}
<C>__{anya }
<D>__{i hope there's no snow in paris. . .}
<L>__{exterior hillside dawn}
<A>__{a glorious bright (and cold) dawn creeps over the horizon. anya stands at edge of the hill, looking down on the city of st.petersburg. the old gray orphanage looms behind her. anya "borrows" an old, beat up bicycle from the orphanage and rides down the hill. music picks up in energy and excitement as anya zooms on her way bumping and bouncing downhill as the sunrises and st. petersburg looms nearer. "a someone and a someplace" (cont.)}
<D>__{music becomes uptempo, hopeful, active, active. anya sings }
<A>__{ full of hope, energy and excitement as she peddles her rickety bike toward the city. "her heart is on its way" and nothing is going to stop her. anya passes though the countryside toward the city. a peasant family waves to her as she goes by. a gypsy troupe performs tricks by the side of the road. a very fancy car zooms by. "a someone and a someplace" (cont.) anya sings, imagining who she might be anyone from a peasant to a princess! but it doesn't matter as long as she finds her real family. people stare at her as she rides into the edge of the city. she is captivated by all the activity: cars, busses, stores, long lines of people, etc. "a someone and a someplace" (cont.) anya sings in this sea faces, there must be someone who has a clue to her identity. she'll stop at nothing to find the someone who once loved her. soaring}
<B>__{musical and vocal conclusion. end musical number}
<A>__{anya does not see a cute little puppy (meetoo) with a huge bone in his mouth, being chased along the sidewalk by a pack of much larger, vicious dogs until he bolts across anya's path forcing her to skid to a stop. she watched him as he scoots into an alley, followed by the angry pack. on reflex, anya drops the bike and reuns into the alley after him.}
