<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{who told you that?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{isn't it true?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{no, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... no, not here... maybe sunday? there's a place off queens blvd. near the courthouse...}
<L>__{exterior coffee shop, queens day}
<A>__{a high angle view of the coffee shop. after a moment, danny enters frame, starts toward it....}
<L>__{interior coffee shop, queens day}
<A>__{danny enters, looks around. to his surprise he sees guy danielsen from the nazi meeting rising, extending his hand.}
<C>__{guy danielsen}
<D>__{danny...guy danielsen...}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(sardonic, now he gets it)}
<D>__{you...}
<A>__{guy shrugs, smiles apologetically. another angle danny & guy with coffee}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{milk...?}
<A>__{as danny declines, guy gets out a small cassette recorder, is about to turn it on, when he notices danny's reaction....}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{is it okay if i record this?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{no... yeah, fine, go ahead... so what's this about? is this about me?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to nexterior...i thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what about curtis zampf?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{curtis is a politician and a bit of a hustler. he's not a thinker.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i agree.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{the other night you said the modern world is a jewish disease. could you elaborate on that?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{in the movement the racialist movement we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. not just in iq, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... why are you writing this down if you're recording it?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{it helps me concentrate.... so does that mean you're a white supremacist?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what should i be, a white inferior ist? a multicultural zulu egalitarian? let me ask, where are your people from?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{my mother's family is french, my father's was german, originally.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{german. mine, too. so who do you think's given more to the world, the germans beethoven, goethe, nietzsche or the entire continent of africa? ibos, bantus, mandingos...}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{danny, what about the jews?}
<A>__{danny shifts in his seat, growing more interested....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{the jews are different.... blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. the jews are...a poison in the human well....}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{a poison...?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{let me give you an example.... sexuality.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{sexuality??? what do you mean?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you ever fuck a jewish girl?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what??!?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{did you ever fuck one, guy?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(laughing, embarrassed)}
<D>__{what's that go to do with...i've gone out with a, with jewish women. why?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{and? what did you notice?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{notice? like what...?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{jewish girls like to give head, right?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i don't know. is that right?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{and jewish men like to get it.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{everybody likes to, don't they?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yes. it's very pleasurable. but the jews are obsessed with it. you know why?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{because the jew is essentially female.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{female...}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{real men white, christian men we fuck a woman. we make her come with our cocks. but the jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust he can't assert himself that directly so he resorts to perversions. oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?}
<P>__{(as guy nods)}
<D>__{after a woman has been with a jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. a normal man.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{does that mean the jew is the better lover?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you're not listening. he isn't better. he gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{danny, what makes you think you know all this?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{let's just say i've done due diligence.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{so, fine, it's not that the jew, the jews own the media and the banks. it's that they're sexually corrupt.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{the jews clearly control the media and the banks. investment banks, not the commercial ones. but the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. they undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.}
<A>__{danny leans over to make sure guy's getting it right.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{deracinate... tear out the roots. a people a real people derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. this is how they know themselves. but the jew doesn't have soil.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{he has israel.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{those aren't jews.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{of course they're jews.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{notice the israelis: a fundamentally secular society. they no longer need judaism because they have soil. the real jew is a wanderer, a nomad. he has no roots, no attachments. so he "universalizes" everything. he can't hammer a nail, plow a field. he can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. he takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. this is his strength....}
<P>__{(pumped; this is what he loves)}
<D>__{take the great jewish minds: marx, freud, einstein. what have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. in a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. why? because it is the deepest impulse of the jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. nothingness without end...}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{are all jews the same?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. for the jew, his jewishness dominates everything. even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. they're still just jews.}
<A>__{guy finishes writing that and looks up.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{danny, this is great. you're incredibly articulate. one more thing... how can you believe this when you're a jew yourself?}
<A>__{a beat. danny smiles at the mistake....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what? excuse me?...}
<P>__{(guy says nothing)}
<D>__{you're kidding, right?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{do you know rabbi stanley nadelman? he used to be at congregation beth elohim in ozone park...?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{who? how would i know him?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{he says you were bar mitzvahed there, in march 1988.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you believe that? and you call yourself a reporter?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{so you're saying it's not true.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{look at me. do i look jewish? look...}
<A>__{he indicates his hair, turns sideways to show his profile?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{do you know who you're fucking with here?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{that's what i'm trying to find out, danny. who am i fucking with here?}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(sputtering, unsure what to say)}
<D>__{listen to me....}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{why would nadelman lie?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{to discredit me. because i know who they are. look, i thought i explained it to you. those people can say or do anything. and they will. it's all narrative to them, it's... are you going to print what this guy said?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{give me a reason not to.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{it's slander. it's reckless disregard. i will sue you and your fucking jew paper.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{does that mean you deny what he says is true? yes or no.}
<A>__{gun: pulled from danny's pants, slammed down on the table... guy sits back abruptly. danny picks it up, cocks it....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{look at me. look at me, guy.... oh, now you can't look at me? look at me, you schmuck. look at me....}
<P>__{(pokes the gun in guy's face)}
<D>__{you print that shit in the new york times...i will kill myself.}
<A>__{everyone in the place is staring. danny walks out, stuffing the gun in his pants, shoving a man aside to get to the door.}
