<L>__{interior prison long corridor day}
<A>__{pete's parents, bill and claire dayton, escorted by a prison guard, are approaching the warden's office. it is a long walk along the corridor and the camera examines them in detail as they get closer and closer to the office. the daytons are a middle aged, san fernando valley couple. bill dayton is wearing a sport shirt with the short sleeves rolled up. his skin is leathery, tanned and his thinning hair is slicked back in a duck tail. he's working class, ex biker. claire dayton was obviously a good looking "chick" who's gone to seed from too much sun, cigarettes and booze. she retains the remnants of a good figure, but it's going fast. claire is wearing sunglasses.}
