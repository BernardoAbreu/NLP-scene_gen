<A>__{walter stands on a crowded bus, staring out the window at the landscape rushing by. the bus pulls to a stop. passengers get off, then a group of girls come crashing onto the bus. they overflow with energy and giggles. walter squeezes back so they can get by, but the bus lurches into motion throwing one of the girls into walter. he helps her regain her balance, and the girl smiles at him.}
