<L>__{interior naomi's apartment day}
<A>__{there's a ring at the doorbell. ralph answers. it's hobson.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{good afternoon, mr snart. is naomi here?}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{you must be the nanny.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{i must be.}
<A>__{ralph embraces her.}
<C>__{hobson }
<D>__{please stop this, i can't inhale and am in danger of treading on one of your knuckles.}
<A>__{ralph releases her.}
<C>__{hobson }
<D>__{if you and your undershirt would walk two paces back i could enter this dwelling.}
<A>__{naomi appears, looking more of a writer than a tour guide.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{well, well.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{ever since i met arthur i liked him. we have to make sure these two wonderful kids stay together...}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{try not to talk. it's not your words but the breath which bears them. perhaps you could repair to the east wing and make me a cup of tea? i wish to speak to naomi.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{sure, sure.}
<A>__{ralph leaves.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{arthur is having a pre wedding party tonight. you should come.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{oh, should i? are all the other girls he passed up going too?}
<A>__{hobson picks up a letter from rainbow press and peruses it.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{don't you want to show arthur how well you're doing?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{tell him thanks, but i have a deadline.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{arthur doesn't know i'm here. he's far too decent to be involved in something so tawdry. you could bring your father. a magical experience before he's too big to leave this apartment.}
<C>__{naomi}
<P>__{(disbelief)}
<D>__{why would i go to this? why would i do that to myself?}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{my dear, if there's one thing old women can tell, it's young men in love. and the food promises to be breathtakingly free.}
<A>__{hobson has a slight dizzy spell and sits down.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{better than you, dear.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{you really look out for arthur, don't you?}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{yes. and it is a job that i recommend highly.}
<A>__{ralph comes back and with a cup of disgusting looking tea.}
<C>__{hobson }
<D>__{you really look out for this gentleman, from what i've heard.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{ah, what am i gonna do? the no kill pet shelter won't take him.}
<A>__{ralph hands hobson the cup of tea.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{thank you. would you go the bathroom and commence washing? you only have three hours and it could be quite a project.}
<A>__{ralph goes. naomi takes the tea.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{i appreciate what you're trying to do but i'm not going to that party.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{suit yourself.}
<A>__{hobson gets up, still dizzy.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{have you seen a doctor?}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{yes. and he has seen me.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{i think arthur has a very good friend. may i kiss you on the cheek?}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{is it something you feel strongly about?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{but hobson falls back into her chair heavily, looking sicker.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{dad! call 911.}
