<A>__{thomas steps inside. it's empty and there's some doubt whether it's been used in a generation. the pews are dusty and scraped, some broken down completely. thomas sits in one and looks across the space and dust and years to the crucifix hanging behind the altar.}

<D>__{so what's the deal, huh?}
<A>__{the pew creaks and groans as he shifts his weight.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{i mean, do you have any kind of plan here? cause i'm just about of ideas, friend.}
<A>__{jesus' pressed metal eyes gaze only upward.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{do you even listen? do you still come to places like this? old man, you have been calling me most of my goddamn life, but every time i get close, you just keep moving that far away. what's it to be? you want me to kill your henchmen? can't you even control your own killers anymore?}
<A>__{thomas holds his face in his hands a silent moment. when it raises we see the raw hurt in the eyes as he shouts,}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{what do you want from me!}
<A>__{the only reply is dust dancing in the light and the rumble of semis on the highway. standing in the back, watching thomas with tears welling in her eyes, is katherine.}
