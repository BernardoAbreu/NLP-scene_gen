<D>__{4:58 a.m.}
<L>__{exterior stranded oldsmobile roadside night}
<A>__{the snow is slacking off. the stranded oldsmobile is now completely snowbound, a car shaped hillock of white on the roadside.}
<L>__{interior stranded oldsmobile night}
<A>__{the interior of the car is eerily quiet, cocooned in snow. the kids sit in silence in the front seat, fighting to stay awake. his face is pale, skull visible beneath the skin. she stares at the black, snow covered windshield.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i gotta pee...}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{again?!}
<A>__{she climbs over into the back seat and crouches down, urinating as demurely as possible into an empty bottle.}
<C>__{guy }
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{i swear, i never met anyone who had to go so much.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{stop talking.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you should ask santa to bring you a bigger bladder.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i'm serious! it's hard enough doing this in front of you.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what, are you one of those people who can't pee with the bathroom door open?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{no. but it's not something i usually do until much later in a relationship...}
<A>__{she catches herself at the last second, but it's too late: the word "relationship" hangs in the air. beat. finished peeing, she twists the cap on the water bottle. sets it on the floor with the other urine filled bottles. noticing one bottle that doesn't look like the others. she climbs over into the front to confront him with the urine bottle, which is tinged with pink. blood.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{what the hell is this? is this blood?}
<A>__{no answer.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{how badly were you hurt in the crash?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{no big deal. just your average day in the nhl...}
<A>__{but she sees through his tough guy facade. he's frightened.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{how long have you known?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{since i tried hiking back to the gas station. you were right, i never got anywhere near it. i}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{started hurling blood, so i turned around and came back.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i didn't want to scare you }
<A>__{suddenly he goes rigid in pain, his teeth clenched. she looks on helplessly.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{we've got to get you some help now. you won't make it to morning. i'm going to try and hike back to the gas station }
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{how far do you think you'd get out there before running into mr. freeze?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i'm not going to just sit here and watch you die!}
<A>__{they sit there a moment in silence. she digs out her cellphone and checks for a signal: no signal bars.}
<C>__{girl }
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{damn it! we need a land line ...}
<A>__{a long beat. then she's struck by an idea. she switches on the wipers to clear snow from the windshield. wipes at the foggy glass until she's got enough of a peephole to peek out.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what are you looking at?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{telephone poles. they must have a junction box or something to test the lines ... there! see that one?}
<A>__{she indicates a telephone pole twenty yards up from them. there's a small grey steel junction box near the top.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{so?}
<A>__{she turns, leaning over the seatback to rummage among his junk in the back. she retrieves his old wall telephone, examines the jack at end of its cord.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{so maybe there's some way i can... i don't know... jack into it or something. try and call for help.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you want to climb a telephone pole?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{of course i don't want to! but it's got rungs. can't be any harder than the climbing wall at my gym. big fat repair guys do it all the time, right? right?}
<A>__{trying to convince herself.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{but you're forgetting one thing...}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{he's out there.}
<A>__{they both go quiet. she sits there with the phone in her lap, brooding on this. until something clicks.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{the song! that old christmas song on the radio. it always comes on just before he shows up...}
<A>__{she switches on the radio. they hear elvis presley's 1957 "blue christmas" playing.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{keep listening. if `rockin' around the christmas tree' comes on, yell like hell.}
<P>__{(trying to convince herself)}
<D>__{hopefully i will have enough time to get back.}
