<L>__{interior blue bay high auditorium morning}
<A>__{the auditorium is packed with the blue bay high student body. the natural order is clear, the pastel flock at the front, the meat headed jocks in the center, and the rejects at the back. marie is amongst her sweater monkey friends, but she's still shocked by what happened out in the parking lot...}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(handing over a present)}
<D>__{happy birthday, babe. they ain't diamonds, but you're just gonna have to wait for those...}
<A>__{marie tentatively opens the gift, sees a pair of opal earrings.}
<C>__{marie}
<P>__{(unconvincing)}
<D>__{thank you. thank you so much...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{are you ok, hon?}
<A>__{marie looks back, to the far reaches of the auditorium where the freaks and geeks crowd round elena, worshipping her like the goddess she is...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{i...yeah...i will be fine...it's just...that new girl...i almost hit her in the parking lot...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you mean the towel girl, the one who transferred in? jesus, she's trouble. you know the only reason she's slinging towels is 'cos it's court ordered...}
<A>__{marie and elena make brief, electric eye contact, across the sea of hormonally challenged students as principal lionel mosster, his ill fitting sports jacket coffee stained, steps onstage.}
<C>__{mosster}
<D>__{we're here today to address a growing epidemic that affects all of you.}
<A>__{he pauses, waits for the student body to quiet down...}
<C>__{mosster}
<D>__{national studies report sexual activity among students at an all time high.}
<A>__{the students all cheer, naturally.}
<C>__{mosster}
<D>__{we'll see who's cheering when you've got an unwanted pregnancy on your hands, or get slapped with a paternity suit...or arrested for date rape. but don't take my word for it...}
<A>__{he motions behind him to kristen richards, early 30's, a natural beauty who's doing her best to hide behind a bland gray suit and glasses, and chad borman, late 20s, devilishly handsome...}
<C>__{principal mosster}
<D>__{miss richards and dr. borman are here to tell you about the pitfalls first hand...}
<A>__{kristen steps up to the lectern.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{good morning, my name is kristen richards. i'm an officer for the miami juvenile parole board, as some of you already know...}
<A>__{quick glance at elena who rolls her eyes...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{but that's not what brings me here today. when i heard about principal mosster's sex education program i thought i'd volunteer my own personal story, in hopes that you might learn from the mistakes i made. back in high school all i wanted to do was get drunk, stoned and laid...}
<A>__{the students roar their approval.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{by my junior year, my life was a blur of cheap beer, anonymous sex, partying every night of the week...}
<A>__{elena covers her mouth, as if to cough...}
<C>__{elena}
<P>__{(through fake coughs)}
<D>__{...whore...}
<A>__{kristen ignores the slur.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{and then, one night at some pathetic frat party, someone slipped a roofie in my drink...and raped me.}
<A>__{this quiets the auditorium.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{there isn't a day goes by my skin doesn't crawl when i think of the violation and humiliation i endured. i can promise you that if you make the same kind of wrong headed choices i did, you'll be seeing dr. borman...}
<A>__{chad steps to the podium.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{thank you, miss richards. my name's dr. chad borman. i run the forensics lab at the police department, where my work has helped convict hundreds of sex offenders. most teens like ms. richards never get their lives together. the physical scars may go away, but the emotional damage stays forever.}
<A>__{while chad drones on, muddy, a gremlin eyed drooler, sitting in front of elena, looks back at her shapely legs as she puts them up on the back of the chair. he spots the ugly plastic bracelet locked around one of her ankles.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{that's not...what i think it is, is it?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{whattchya think it is, bitch?}
<A>__{the words catch in his throat.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{one of them...parole leashes...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{bingo.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{so you can't, like, go more than ten miles from the cop shop?}
<A>__{elena taps the flashing red light on the plastic bracelet.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{five. i got someone's panties in a bunch.}
<A>__{back at the podium, chad leans forward, making sure his words resonate with the student body.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{and as for the perpetrators of this heinous act, even if you are still a minor, you will be tried as an adult, and, if convicted, you will do hard time.}
<A>__{he pauses to let the impact of this wash over the students.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{are there any questions?}
<C>__{elena}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{yeah, i got one for miss richards.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{ask away.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{when they found the scumbag who took your precious flower of virginity, you sued his sorry ass, right?}
<A>__{kristen is taken aback by elena's insensitivity, stumbles over her words, finally spitting out the sad, sorry truth...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{uh, no, actually, i was never able to make a positive id. all i remember was his alcohol soaked breath whispering in my ear, "you won't remember, but you'll never forget..."}
<A>__{elena cracks a sideways grin...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{so what you're really saying is you fucked for free...}
<A>__{kristen has no answer to that. principal mosster does his best to control the situation...}
<C>__{principal mosster}
<D>__{miss sandoval. you're on thin ice, young lady!}
<A>__{like elena cares. she leans back, nods. job done.}
