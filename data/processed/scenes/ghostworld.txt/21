<A>__{the camera reaches the top of the stairs, we see a door that slowly creaks open. we move into the room beyond, it's decorated with stuff from the 50's and a giant crucifix. we hear a televangelist's sermon. we move close on a little girl's doll. very slowly a man's hand reaches for the doll and drags it into the shadows. the hand throws the now mutilated doll into a toilet; water and blood swirl around. we see grainy footage (shot off of tv) of christians angrily picketing an abortion clinic. credits come up: the end. a}
