<L>__{exterior neighborhood day semi long shot}
<A>__{we see a three storied, flat roofed apartment house. the brick is weather worn and faded. each apartment has three windows facing the back, one showing a hallway, one a living room, and the window on the right opening into a bedroom. on the second floor, a man has entered the living room from a hallway door. he carries a large aluminum sample case common to salesmen. he sets down the case heavily, removes his hat, and slowly wipes his brow with the back of his right hand. he takes off his coat and tie. his shirt is stained with sweat underneath. he rolls up his sleeves, and his well muscled arms heavy with hair confirm his dark, husky build.}
