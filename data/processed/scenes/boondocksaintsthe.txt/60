<L>__{interior rocco's apartment night one hour later}
<A>__{the three are partying hard. there's a pizza surrounded by guinness cans as they whoop it up, sitting at the round table. rocco wears one of the masks. they're all drunk. the house cat is lounging on the table comfortably.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{you fuckin' guys. you ruined me. i'm fuckin' done. permanent package boy.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{who says that? you could take credit on it.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{what are you serious?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{yeah, fuck it. if you think about it, it's all you can do really. you can't tell him it was us. go in braggin' and shit.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{climb the corporate ladder, boy. don rocco.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{fuck it! i'm doing it. i deserve it. i've been working for those fat bastards since i was in high school and look at this place.}
<A>__{the boys nod in agreement.}
<C>__{rocco}
<P>__{(working into a frenzy)}
<D>__{they're fuckin' me man! hey, they can suck my pathetic little dick. and i will dip my nuts in marinara just so the fat fucks can get a taste of home while they're at it. that's it, it's done, i'm doing it.}
<A>__{rocco slams his fist down on the table next to murphy's gun. the gun goes off with a bang! and blows the lounging cat right off the table. a softball sized hole is blasted in the wall as a large splatter of blood sprays the area surrounding the hole. everyone is in shock for a second.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i can't fuckin' believe that just happened!}
