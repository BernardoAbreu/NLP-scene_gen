<L>__{interior department store gift wrap counter rome, n.y. day}
<A>__{roberta is behind the counter, meticulously wrapping a present with ribbons, bows and stickers. at one point she even unties a ribbon and redoes it because it's not perfect. she looks pretty, but she's dressed conservatively, like a navy housewife. there's only one other clerk wrapping gifts and a long line of impatient customers. a male supervisor appears behind roberta.}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{just wrap. you're not picasso.}
<A>__{he exits, and roberta quickly tries to finish her task.}
<C>__{male voice }
<D>__{picasso would probably put the bows on the back of the box.}
<A>__{roberta looks up to find brian turner (40), a handsome, sexy guy with longish hair and a beat up leather jacket.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{brian turner?}
<C>__{brian}

<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i thought you moved away.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i did. i'm in town for my mom's birthday.}
<A>__{he holds out his hand. roberta misunderstands the gesture and tries to shake his hand.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{no that's her gift.}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{oh! sorry.}
<A>__{roberta hands him the gift she's been wrapping.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{it looks very pretty.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i heard you had a book published. i didn't read it but...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{that's o.k. my parents didn't read it either. it looks good on their coffee table, though.}
<A>__{roberta smiles.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{so what are you doing here? i thought you'd be in carnegie hall by now.}
<A>__{hold on roberta as she takes this in.}
