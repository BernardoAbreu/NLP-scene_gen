<L>__{6) holden sits in the park that he and alyssa walked}
<A>__{through. he's staring at alyssa's yearbook picture. he closes the book and sighs. then, an idea hits him. he jumps up and dashes out of the park.}
<L>__{int studio night}
<A>__{banky and alyssa sit on the couch. holden paces in front of them.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i know you're wondering why i asked you both here tonight, at the same time, knowing that we have shit to settle between us, separately.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{i just figured you wanted to kill two birds with one stone by telling her to fuck off with me here so you didn't have to go through the story again later on.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{not even if you let me videotape it.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{enough!}
<P>__{(they both look at him)}
<D>__{i've been going through things, over and over. and i dissected it all, and looked at it a thousand different ways. banky there's friction between us for the first time in our lives. you hate me dating alyssa and you want me to sign off on this m tv thing.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{how perceptive.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{alyssa you and i hit a wall, because i don't know how to deal with... your past, i guess.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{that's a nice way of putting it. i'd have said the whole double stuff thing...}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(right in his face)}
<D>__{i'm only going to say it once: shut up.}
<P>__{(back to pacing)}
<D>__{now i know i'm to blame one way or the other on both accounts. with you, alyssa it's my fault because i feel inadequate. because you've had so much experience, had such a big life; and my life's been pretty small in comparison.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{that doesn't matter to me...}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{please. i have to get through this.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and with you banky i know why you're having such a hard time with alyssa, and it's something that's been obvious forever, but i guess i just didn't acknowledge it.}
<P>__{(takes a deep breath)}
<D>__{you're in love with me.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(makes a face; beat)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you're attracted to me. just as, in a way, i'm attracted to you. i mean, it makes sense we've been together so long, we have so much in common...}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{well, i've got to get home and catch the last few minutes of 'babylon 5', so i will be...}
<A>__{holden grabs him, kisses him full on the lips, and pushes him back onto the couch alyssa reacts. banky wide eyed and speechless looks away.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{it's something you're going to have to deal with. bank. you may very well be gay, which explains your homophobia and why you're so jealous of alyssa, and your sense of humor as well.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{just 'cause a guy's got a predilection coward dick jokes...}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{bank. stop. deal with it. you'll feel much better.}
<A>__{he grabs a chair from the side of the room.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{now at this point, you may be asking yourself the question that i've been going over and over in my head for the last few days: what does one have to do with the other?}
<A>__{alyssa's face drops. she subtly shakes her head.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{don't.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{and when i did some serious soul searching, it came at me from out of nowhere, and suddenly it all made sense a calm came over me. i know what we have to do. and then you bank, you alyssa, and i all of us... can finally be... alright.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(again, under her breath)}
<D>__{please don't say it.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(sits in the chair; takes a long beat)}
<D>__{we've all got to have sex together.}
<A>__{the room is silent. holden lights a cigarette. banky's eyes nearly bug. alyssa's head drops.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{don't you see? that would take care of everything. alyssa i wouldn't feel inadequate or too conservative anymore. i will have done something on par with all the experience you've had. and it'll be with you, which'll make it that much more powerful. and banky you can cake that leap that everyone else but you sees that you should take. and it'll be okay, because it'll be with me your best friend for years. we've been everything to each other but intimates. and now, we'll have been through that together too. and it won't have to be a total leap for you, because a woman will be involved. and when it's over, all that aggression you feel toward alyssa will be gone. because you'll have shared in something beautiful with the woman i love. it'll be cathartic. a true communion. we have to do this. for me, for both of you... for all of our sakes. this will keep us together.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what do you say?}
<A>__{banky stares forward, wide eyed. he leans back into the couch and lets out a huge sigh. then shrugs.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{holden smiles at his friend. then he looks at alyssa.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you know i need this. you know it'll help.}
<A>__{alyssa looks at him, sadly.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{holden reacts, shocked banky lets out a sigh of relief.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{no? i... i thought you'd be into this.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{you did? what does that say about me?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{but you've... you've done... stuff... like this. this should be no big deal for you.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{you don't want this.}
<P>__{(lights her cigarette)}
<D>__{you really don't want this. trust me.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i need this. this has to happen. why can't you see that? and how can you not? what does that say about me? you can take it from two guys whose names you can barely remember, but i ask you to share an experience like it where it's about intimacy and you say no?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(inhales from her cigarette, takes a beat)}
<D>__{i can't.}
<A>__{holden moves to her side of the couch.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you can. i will be there. and when it's over, we'll be the strongest we've ever been because we got through some nasty shit together. and we'll finally be on the same level together. and then there'll be nothing we can't accomplish.}
<A>__{a tear rolls down her cheek she looks at him, sadly, and touches his face.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{oh holden.}
<P>__{(trying to compose herself)}
<D>__{that time is over for me. i've been there. i've done it. and i didn't find what i was looking for in any of it. i found that in you in us. doing this won't help you forget about the things you're hung up on. it'll create more.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{no it won't. i thought about all of that.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{no, it will. maybe you'll see me differently from then on maybe you'll despise me for going along with it, once you're in the moment. maybe i will moan differently and then you'll resent banky, and become suspicious of us. or you'll alienate him because of it, and then grow to blame and hate me for the deterioration of your friendship. or what if i sincerely doubt it, but what if i saw something in banky that i never saw before, and fell in love with him and left you. i've been down roads like this before; many times. i know you feel doing this will broaden your horizons and give you experience. but i've had those experiences on my own. i can't accompany you on your's. i'm past that now.}
<P>__{(touches his face; stares to cry)}
<D>__{or maybe i just love you too much. and i feel hurt and let down that you'd want to share me with anyone. because i never wanted to share you}
<P>__{(holds it in; gets up)}
<D>__{regardless i can't be a part of this.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{or you. not anymore}
<P>__{(hugs him)}
<D>__{i love you. i always will. know that.}
<A>__{she releases him, then slaps him.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{but i'm not your fucking whore.}
<A>__{alyssa storms away, stopping briefly to look banky up and down.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{he's your's again.}
<A>__{she walks our of the studio. the door closes behind her. banky and holden stand there, silently. cut to black.}
