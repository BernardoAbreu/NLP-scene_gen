<L>__{exterior reservation woods night}
<A>__{ray shuts the door behind her and starts toward the river. she turns and runs along the bank...a long way...then slows down. breathing hard, she stops. snow melts on her face. a long moment passes. the sound of the river ice pushing against the bank releases a long, deep moan all around her.}
<L>__{interior village bakery, kitchen night}
<A>__{lila and bernie sit on the old sofa by the big oven.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{he might be better off.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{jake wouldn't agree with that.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{it was all for a new crib. i wanted the baby to have a pretty new crib, not some handmedown. and he wouldn't let me go alone. (laughs) i was too fat to get behind the steering wheel.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{he wanted to keep you and little jake safe.}
<A>__{the back door opens. ray is there.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's just a few months, right?}
<A>__{bernie and lila turn around. ray walks in.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{i got baby stuff in the shed.}
<A>__{she takes the folded double wide contract out of her pocket and holds it out to lila.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{get a good used single wide with insulation. insulation is the key thing. versailles will give you a hard time, but that will leave enough for you and the boys to live on for a couple of months.}
<P>__{ricky's allergic to penicillin.(a moment)}
<D>__{and you can't feed `em pringles all the time. okay?}
<A>__{lila isn't sure.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{okay?}
<A>__{lila nods her head.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{but you gotta get there quick, before the police, `cause t.j. will get scared. i don't want him to get scared, you know.}
<A>__{ray chokes back her own tears.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{lila takes the contract from ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{and don't let him jerk you around. versailles, i mean. (to bernie) go with her. okay?}
<A>__{bernie nods.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{sure.}
