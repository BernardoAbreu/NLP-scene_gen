<A>__{d'agosta turns to kawakita who waits, shifting from foot to foot.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{damn. there's some kind of problem in the computer room. i have to go get ippolito. you wait here.}
<A>__{d'agosta heads into the exhibit before kawakita can protest.}
<L>__{interior superstition exhibit night}
<A>__{we see various cuts of people as they move into the different rooms. a teenage girl (lauren) and her father (david) examine a lidless, rotting european style coffin, complete with corpse. a white haired gentleman (dr. pound), leans on his cane as he looks at a display on primitive medicine practiced with implements that look like torture tools. cuthbert and ippolito are at the head of a press of people, giving the mayor and his wife a guided tour.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{here we have a very rare sacrificial table from mesoamerica. the priests would kill the victim on this slab, cut out the heart and eat it while it was still beating.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{i could use one of these things in city hall.}
<A>__{cuthbert laughs right on cue. they pass a congo power figure with its bulging eye sockets and torso riddled with sharp nails. several people recoil from it, looking repulsed. the mayor's wife sees it and looks distressed.}
<C>__{mayor's wife}
<D>__{you're letting kids see this? i should think they'd have nightmares.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{kid will love it. they're our target audience. nothing here is as violent as what they see on t.v.}
<A>__{they pass a mummy dripping in blood. the mayor gestures to it.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{i don't know. that could be a little over the top. it's not even scientific. mummies don't bleed.}
<A>__{cuthbert's smile fades as he sees the mummy. close on... the mayor's white cuff as he extends his hand to point at the mummy. the pristine white of his cuff is suddenly colored by a falling red drop of blood. cuthbert sees it. so does the mayor and ippolito. they look up as another drop of blood falls right on cuthbert's face. and yet another droplet falls on the mayor's wife's white bosom, exposed by her low cut dress!}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{oh... my... god...}
<A>__{their pov... above the mummy's head, the top of the case is cut away, exposing a ceiling crawling with steam pipes and ductwork. a hand, a watch, and the cuff of a blue shirt protrude over the edge of the case. a small icicle of blood hangs from the middle finger. and another drop falls. cuthbert screams at the top of his lungs! conscious of the panic factor, ippolito yells.}
<C>__{ippolito}
<D>__{quiet everyone!}
<A>__{but it's too late. the room is packed with people. and d'agosta himself is just pushing through the door as another woman cries out...}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{there's a body up there!}
<A>__{a ripple of fear goes over the faces in the room, titters as people wonder if it's a joke. at that moment from the darkness above, the ceiling buckles and something falls! it's officer doyle's headless torso, dripping blood! utter pandemonium breaks loose! the close space echoes with screams and shouts. people claw at each other, stumbling desperately trying to get to the door. a young woman falls and d'agosta runs to her to keep her from being trampled in the stampede.}
