<A>__{dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset. eric plays the guitar loud, the shelly theme in a major key. where before it was wandering, uncertain, now it's bold and heartbreaking. definitive. pain replaced by strength and a sense of homecoming. as eric gets to the end of it, the notes are flying out... at the climax, rips the guitar up over his head and brings it down smash on the pignose. he's finished here. roof edge from street as the broken guitar sails out over the building edge.}
