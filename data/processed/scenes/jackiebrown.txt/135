<L>__{interior toyota (moving) day}
<A>__{oredell in the passenger seat, bends over to the backseat, grabs the shopping bag, and brings it to his lap. he looks like a kid at christmas.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{you keep drivin' down ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. we're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.}
<P>__{(pause)}

<C>__{louis}
<D>__{that's what i gotta tell you. she bugged me the whole time. got pissy with me 'cause i wouldn't let her carry the bag. started running her fuckin' mouth... i couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "is it this aisle lou is, is it that one?" she was totally fuckin' with my nerves.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{so what, you left her there.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i shot her.}
<A>__{ordell just looks at him.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{i expect she's dead.}
<A>__{ordell still doesn't say anything... then says;}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{you shot melanie?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{twice. in the parking lot.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{couldn't talk to her?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you know how she is.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{you couldn't just hit her?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{maybe... but at that moment... i dunno...}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{you shot her twice?}
<C>__{louis}

<D>__{pretty sure.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{where did you shoot her?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{in the chest and stomach.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. what we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. anybody but that woman.}
<A>__{ordell shrugs it off, and digs into the shopping bag. he pulls out the towels and sees forty thousand dollars on top of a bunch of paperbacks. his stomach drops. he just looks inside the bag for the longest time. louis drives, oblivious to ordell's dilemma.}
<C>__{ordell }
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{louis?}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(not looking at him)}
<D>__{what?}

<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{came outta where?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{the fitting room. it went down exactly the way it was supposed to.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{how long was she in there?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{maybe a minute. she came right out.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{louis, you tellin' me the truth?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{look, i swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and i took it from her.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{then what?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{we went to the parking lot.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{where you shot her.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{you sure she ain't somewhere with a half a million dollars i worked my ass off to earn?}
<A>__{louis looks at ordell;}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{fuck you for asking me that.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{pull the car over.}
<A>__{louis pulls it over, and stops on ninth.}
<C>__{ordell }
<D>__{what'd you shoot her with?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{it's in there.}
<A>__{ordell opens the glove box and takes out the beretta. he smells the end of the barrel. he releases the magazine.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{what's that gonna tell you" if i was really pullin' a burn, i'd have taken two out, wouldn't i? i thought you trusted me.}
<A>__{ordell looks at him. louis didn't burn him.}
<B>__{closeup ordell}
<A>__{he thinks.}
