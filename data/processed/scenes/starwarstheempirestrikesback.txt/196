<L>__{interior cloud city corridor}
<A>__{lando, han, and leia continue down the corridor unaware of threepio's dreadful accident. chewbacca glances around, sniffs the air, but shrugs his shoulders and follows the group.}
<L>__{exterior dagobah bog dusk}
<A>__{in the bright lights of the fighter, luke loads a heavy case into the belly of the ship. artoo sits on top of the x wing, settling down into his cubbyhole. yoda stands nearby on a log.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{luke! you must complete the training.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i can't keep the vision out of my head. they're my friends. i've got to help them.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{you must not go!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but han and leia will die if i don't.}
<C>__{ben's voice}
<D>__{you don't know that.}
<A>__{luke looks toward the voice in amazement. ben has materialized as a real, slightly shimmering image near yoda. the power of his presence stops luke.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{even yoda cannot see their fate.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but i can help them! i feel the force!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{but you cannot control it. this is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the force.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{yes, yes. to obi wan you listen. the cave. remember your failure at the cave!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but i've learned so much since then. master yoda, i promise to return and finish what i've begun. you have my word.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it is you and your abilities the emperor wants. that is why your friends are made to suffer.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{and that is why i have to go.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{luke, i don't want to lose you to the emperor the way i lost vader.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you won't.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{stopped they must be. on this all depends. only a fully trained jedi knight with the force as his ally will conquer vader and his emperor. if you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as vader did, you will become an agent of evil.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{patience.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{and sacrifice han and leia?}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{if you honor what they fight for ... yes!}
<A>__{luke is in great anguish. he struggles with the dilemma, a battle raging in his mind.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{if you choose to face vader, you will do it alone. i cannot interfere.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i understand.}
<P>__{(he moves to his x wing)}
<D>__{artoo, fire up the converters.}
<A>__{artoo whistles a happy reply.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{luke, don't give in to hate that leads to the dark side.}
<A>__{luke nods and climbs into his ship.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{strong is vader. mind what you have learned. save you it can.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i will. and i will return. i promise.}
<A>__{artoo closes the cockpit. ben and yoda stand watching as the roar of the engines and the wind engulf them.}
<C>__{yoda}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{told you, i did. reckless is he. now matters are worse.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that boy is our last hope.}
<C>__{yoda}
<P>__{(looks up)}
<D>__{no. there is another.}
