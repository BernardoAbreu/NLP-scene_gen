<A>__{miss lippenreider is still eavesdropping for loveless, through binos.}
<C>__{miss lippenreider}
<D>__{west. how do you know it's not just bullshit? gordon. step over the fence and find out. rita and i will put flowers on your grave every year.}
<L>__{exterior cornfield perimeter west day}
<A>__{stands next to the little fence, watching loveless escape.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i don't have time for this.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{wait, i have an auxiliary tool kit!}
<A>__{gordon peels back the top of his boot revealing it. but it's too late. west has jumped over the fence. then he hops back inside it. he holds his hands out to gordon.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{see? nothing happened.}
<A>__{west grabs gordon by the back of his vest and yanks him over the fence. now they hear a slight buzzing in the air and it's not a bee. new angle disc comes whipping over the corn straight for west's head. in a split second, he ducks and the disc cuts the tops of the corn off and banks around for a new attack.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{oh, really...?}
<A>__{now both of them step over the fenced perimeter and start running like hell through the cornfield.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{is it too late to take it off of me now?}
