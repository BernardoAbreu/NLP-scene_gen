<L>__{exterior an alley a little later close on furious}
<A>__{as he comes to with a qroan and sees... the bowler and invisible boy tied up and gagged, with the raja, shoveler, and the spleen trussed up right next to them. furious looks up, sees tony p standing over him.}
<C>__{tony p}
<D>__{hi, cutie.}
<A>__{furious struggles, but he has been secured with some very heavy tire chains. tony p takes out a large caliber revolver, flips it open to make sure it's loaded.}
<C>__{tony p}
<D>__{six losers. six bullets. perfect... got any last words, angry boy?}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{disco sucks.}
<C>__{tony p}
<D>__{disco sucks. very good. you know what i'm gonna do, angry boy, since you're so colorful? i'm gonna save you for last.}
<A>__{he turns and points the pistol right at invisible boy's head. furious struggles against his chains to no avail.}
<C>__{tony p}
<D>__{sweet dreams, punk.}
<A>__{invisible boy closes his eyes... tony p cocks the pistol... but suddenly, there is the ring of steel a broad blade sweeps through the air, and tony p's pistol is sliced neatly in half.}
<C>__{tony p}
<P>__{(holding half a pistol)}
<D>__{holy...}
<A>__{the man is the strange steel mask is standing there, the drawn machete still in his hand.}
<C>__{man in mask}
<D>__{buenos naches.}
<C>__{tony p}
<D>__{get him!}
<A>__{the disco boys rush the newcomer, but he slices through their baseball bats with his machete, and sends them reeling and crashing into each other with expert forearm blows, whacks with the flat of his blade, and head butts with his mask. furious struggles to break free and join the fight, but the chains are too strong... and the stranger doesn't need any help. tony p flicks open a big switchblade and lunges at the stranger, who sidesteps him like a matador and swings his machete at him. tony p turns, about to charge again.}
<C>__{man in mask}
<P>__{(mexican accent)}
<D>__{would you like me to trim the sides?}
<C>__{tony p}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{tony p feels the top of his head, and realizes that the blow from the machete has neatly sliced off the top his disco do, leaving only stubble on the top of his head.}
<C>__{tony p}
<P>__{(freaking out)}
<D>__{let's get outta here!}
<A>__{tony and the disco boys run for it... furious and the others study their masked savior, who stands before them, machete in hand.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{you're the sphinx.}
<C>__{sphinx}
<D>__{and you are a fool.}
<A>__{he raises his machete above furious' head... and then slices clean through the chains.}
