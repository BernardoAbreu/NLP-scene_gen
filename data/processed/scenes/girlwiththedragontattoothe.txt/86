<L>__{exterior martin's house evening}
<A>__{martin, wearing an apron, opens the door to find both his dinner guests on the porch.}
<C>__{liv}
<D>__{i found him at death's door halfway up the hill.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i'm afraid i'm a bit out of shape.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{no, it's a climb for anyone. i should've warned you. come on in.}
<A>__{blomkvist puts a bottle of aquavit in martin's hand.}
<L>__{interior martin's house night}
<A>__{the place is far cry from vanger's manor. it's modern. martin, liv and blomkvist work on the dinner martin has prepared. soft jazz music issues from somewhere.}
<C>__{liv}
<D>__{i used to work in the company's petrochemical division in goteborg. when it was sold, i went with it.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{a dark day.}
<C>__{liv}
<D>__{i live in hong kong now, but come back to stockholm for family events, and when i do, i drive up to spend a couple days with martin.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{she comes for the moose steak.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{is that what this is?}
<A>__{they all glance away to a sound: a soft, strange, wailing wind. martin drains the last of a bottle of wine in blomkvist's glass and gets up.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{something's open. you like this one, or would you like to try something else?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{that one's good.}
<A>__{martin heads off to the kitchen. blomkvist and liv, left with each other, seem unsure what to talk about.}
<C>__{liv}
<D>__{i saw you on sky news a while ago.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{that was a dark day.}
<C>__{liv}
<D>__{sorry to remind you of it.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{it's okay. there are worse things than libel though i can't immediately think of one in my business.}
<C>__{liv}
<D>__{you're writing a book now, martin said.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{henrik's biography.}
<C>__{liv}
<D>__{i love henrik. he's fascinating. martin, too. together they're the old sweden and the new.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{they are.}
<C>__{liv}
<D>__{you know about harriet, right?}
<A>__{blomkvist doesn't say. the sound of the wind stops.}
<C>__{liv}
<D>__{you don't?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{martin emerges from the cellar with a bottle of wine in hand and returns with it to the dining room.}
<D>__{liv o s the family doesn't like to talk about it, but it can't just be swept under the rug.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what can't.}
<C>__{liv}
<D>__{harriet.}
<A>__{martin doesn't comment. just nods. silence. then }
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{maybe we could talk about that later.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{we can talk about it now.}
<P>__{(blomkvist glances to liv)}
<D>__{liv knows everything about my crazy family. which is why she'll never marry me.}
<C>__{liv}
<D>__{that's one reason.}
<A>__{she holds up her left hand. a wedding ring is on it. the couple seems very comfortable with each other, not unlike blomkvist and erika.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{don't put that in your book. anything else is fine. harriet certainly. everything changed after that. not just the family, but the company.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{how so.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{we're not nordea or ericsson, but we're still the largest family owned company in the country. at the height, we had 40,000 employees. we have about half that now, and that downward slide anyone can tell you began after my sister's death. it broke henrik's entrepreneurial spirit, and his heart.}
<A>__{and martin's, too, clearly. blomkvist dares to ask, as innocently as possible }
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{you were here that day?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{everyone was here, though i didn't get in until after the accident on the bridge. the 4:30 train.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i know it well.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{it was a terrible day. and the days after searching and not finding her were even worse.}
<A>__{liv sets her hand atop her boyfriend's.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{this event, mikael, has to be a big part of your book.}
<A>__{blomkvist promises him with a nod that it will.}
