<L>__{exterior loveless mansion outside study west night}
<A>__{emerges just as a kentucky reel starts up. he weaves his way through the dance floor and spots the soiled dove look alike out on the floor. west reluctantly straightens his shoulders and cuts in. this bold move gets some looks of disapproval from the pecan pie crowd.}
<B>__{angle on west and soiled dove ringer}
<A>__{dancing. both look straight ahead, not at each other. west so as not to attract any more attention. his partner because she's scared shitless of this strange negro who keeps hounding her.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{real impressed the way you got the dance floor staked out. maybe one of your missin' scientists'll cut in.}
<P>__{(dip)}
<D>__{thought you should know that while you were trying to decide what shoes to wear tonight...}
<P>__{(twirl)}
<D>__{i found that our host, dr. loveless...}
<A>__{west looks over to where loveless is leading a contingent of foreigners out a side exit.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{... is meeting mcgrath and his troops at malheureux point in an hour.}
<P>__{(bends her back)}
<D>__{so you enjoy the party. i'm gonna go save the republic.}
<A>__{the soiled dove look alike is speechless. before he goes, west leans in, smirks.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{but i will say, good work on your bladders tonight... they're damn perky.}
<A>__{and just to dig the grave deeper, west lays hands on them and gives them a little squeeze. this immediately elicits a scream and a slap in the face that shocks the bejesus out of the black cowboy. and he's not the only one.}
<B>__{angle on crowd}
<A>__{staring at him. we know what they're thinking, but the mountain man behind west says it for everyone.}
<D>__{gordon mountain man hang him!}
<A>__{and with that, gordon opens his deerskin jacket to reveal his own rope, which he throws to the mob. west looks back at the character in amazement. that's gordon?! before west can say or do anything, guns are at his temple, and he's swept out of the room. gordon calmly straightens his coonskin cap, seemingly uninterested in west's imminent hanging. in the hubbub of everyone rushing out for the hanging, gordon heads up the unguarded stairs to the locked room. as he pulls out his high tech auto wind lock pick and quickly gains entrance to the door...}
