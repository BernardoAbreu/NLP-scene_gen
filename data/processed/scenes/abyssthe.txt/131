<A>__{the umbilical drops down in slack loops out of the blackness above, draping itself over the habitat in large coils. one night pilots her submersible feverishly among the falling loops. she banks and twists. a length of heavy umbilical slams onto her neck, tipping the sub. she manages to get out from under it a keep going.}

<A>__{through the front viewport they can see the coils of cable piling up in front of the rig. the hull booms with impacts as the massive stuff hits. everyone hold their breath as the sonar return pings get closer... and closer. and closer... an enormous shape plunged into the floodlight in front of the rig. k wham!! the 40 ton crane hits like a flatiron thirty feet in front of them. a clean miss. much whooping and cheering. then... the crane topples slowly over the back. it rolls down the slope of the drop off, gathering speed. then tumbles over the cliff into the abyssal canyon. the coiled umbilical starts to pay out after it like rope after a harpoon. and they're still attached.}
