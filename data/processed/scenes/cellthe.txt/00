<B>__{a speck of dust}
<A>__{grains of sand dance in the wind. as we glide over a vast desert, the speck of dust becomes a horse and rider. catherine young straddles the beautiful black animal, her mesmerizing eyes scanning the horizon. a curious breeze blows across her exquisite face and she drinks it in, as if the wind itself were telling something to her... catherine sees a flickering light in the sand. she pulls the reins and the horse stops moments before the dune drops into nothingness. she dismounts, affectionately scratches the horse's neck, and follows the light. when she looks over her shoulder, the arabian is now a child's wooden hobby horse. not surprised, catherine smiles and walks down a dune, sand sliding beneath her feet... she finds herself in a valley of dead trees whose decayed, gnarled limbs appear to form hands. the light dances across her face. she shades her eyes and pinpoints the source... a small mirror reflecting rays of bright sun, housed within a locket and chain. it's held by edward, a haunted looking boy of seven with a precocious grin and piercing eyes. he sits on a fallen tree trunk, patiently waiting for her arrival.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{thanks for the horse.}
<A>__{he's a shy child, yet comfortable with catherine.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you liked him?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{he's beautiful...}
<A>__{edward smiles, delighted he made her happy.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{but i thought we were going sailing.}
<A>__{the boy frowns.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{you promised.}
<A>__{a devilish glint in his eye, edward redirects the mirror. catherine follows the flicker to a toy boat in the sand.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{we can't fit into that!}
<A>__{edward shines light in her eyes, momentarily blinding her, then snaps the locket shut. when her vision clears, catherine sees a giant ship perched among the dunes. a craft weighing hundreds of tons just sitting there in the desert.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{that'll do.}
<A>__{she walks toward it, but edward doesn't follow.}
<C>__{catherine }
<P>__{(coaxing him)}
<D>__{come on, mister e.}
<A>__{she extends her hand, but he adamantly shakes his head no.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{what now?}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(nods at the ship)}
<D>__{'s broken.}
<A>__{undaunted, she... finds herself standing on the deck.}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(calling to him)}
<D>__{who says?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{mocky lock.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{oh no... no you don't.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{"mocky lock is the bogeyman. mocky lock wants me where i am."}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i bet we can fix it.}
<A>__{she opens a rusted iron door. it makes an horrific screeching sound. similar to metal on metal, but more piercing, more pained. as if made by a living thing.}
<C>__{catherine }
<P>__{(familiar with the noise, a warning to him)}
<D>__{ed ward...}
<A>__{the boy's face contorts, turning into something half human, half animal. a monster. mocky lock. he screeches, trying to frighten catherine, but she cocks her head...}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{we agreed. no more mocky lock.}
<A>__{the creature sticks its tongue out and dives.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{edward!}
<A>__{but it's too late! edward mocky lock slithers into the sand and disappears. resigning herself to a failure, she opens the palm of her left hand, revealing a small bump in the flesh between thumb and forefinger. she presses hard and...}
