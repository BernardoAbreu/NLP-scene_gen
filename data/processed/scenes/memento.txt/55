<A>__{teddy pours ketchup all over his steak. leonard plays with his food.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{not hungry?}
<C>__{leonard}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{it's my condition. i never know if i've already eaten, so i always just eat small amounts.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{you don't have to remember to be hungry.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{it's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. you get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. have i told you about sammy jankis?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{yeah, yeah. i heard enough about him. tell me about john g. you still think he's here, right?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{the guy you're looking for, johnny g. that's why you haven't left. am i right?}
<A>__{leonard shrugs. teddy licks his fingers and frowns.}
<C>__{teddy }
<D>__{leonard, you need to be very careful.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. get you to kill the wrong guy.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{yeah, well i go on facts, not recommendations, okay?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{because you're relying on them alone. you don't remember what you've discovered or how. your notes might be unreliable.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{memory's unreliable.}
<A>__{teddy snorts.}
<C>__{leonard }
<D>__{no, really. memory's not perfect. it's not even that good. ask the police, eyewitness testimony is unreliable. the cops don't catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff. they collect facts, make notes, draw conclusions. facts, not memories: that's how you investigate. i know, it's what i used to do. memory can change the shape of a room or the color of a car. it's an interpretation, not a record. memories can be changed or distorted and they're irrelevant if you have the facts.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{you really want to find this guy?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{he took away the woman i love and he took away my memory. he destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{you're living.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{just for revenge. that's what keeps me going. it's all i have.}
<A>__{teddy considers this.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{we'll find him. where are you staying?}
<A>__{leonard reaches into his pocket and takes out a polaroid.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{discount inn. don't know what room; haven't got my key.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{probably left it in your room.}
