<A>__{he stares at the closed bathroom door where derek and stacey make love. he sits at the computer and begins to type.}
<C>__{danny }

<D>__{there was only one person derek loved more than stacey sanders.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior vinyard household – morning – flashback}
<A>__{the place is immaculate. dennis vinyard, the father of the household, eats his breakfast in his la county firefighter uniform . vintage fireman material: muscular, receding hairline, zero facial hair. handsome. a pretty and well dressed doris scrambles eight eggs with mushroom and red peppers.}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{that was dad. derek and dad were best friends…which is something i’ve never heard of before. fathers and sons are never best friends... but they were.}
<A>__{younger danny stares at his larger than life father. dennis takes his fire helmet off the table and sets it on the floor.}
<C>__{doris}
<P>__{(towards the back)}
<D>__{breakfast!}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{let’s go, davina! derek!}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{so what’s this all about, dennis?}
<A>__{dennis doesn’t hear his wife because his attention is focused on danny. younger derek, donning a flat top haircut and no tattoos, walks into the kitchen. the smiling athlete has his backpack and blue santa monica city college gym bag. he drops it onto the ground and sits at the table. his father stares at him.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{good morning.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{doris sets food in front of her two sons and they both go to work. young danny eats quietly.}
<C>__{doris}
<P>__{(to her husband)}
<D>__{are you going to keep ignoring me?}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{jesus doris... it’s not that big of a deal. all departments have to take a precaution class on gang patrol today.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{a guy was shot yesterday in inglewood while changin’ a valve on a hydrant and lapd is worried more firefighters will become targets. that’s what this bullshit is about.}
<P>__{(sipping coffee)}
<D>__{a good father this guy was though and now he’s in intensive care because of some goddamn... nigger. compton crips have pretty much declared war on lapd and us.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{why you guys though? i can see lapd but the fire department?}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{they think we would rather let a building burn down over there than fight it.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{they hit the nail on the head, basically.}
<C>__{dennis}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{pretty much, yeah.}
<P>__{(then, to derek)}
<D>__{hey? are you ready for tonight or what?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{hell yeah he is.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{let it all burn down i say dad.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{yeah. so…now we got two fights goin’ on at one goddamn time. and of course you know whose fault that is?}

<C>__{dennis}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i didn’t know you spoke "african", dan?}
<A>__{derek and dennis laugh. danny looks at them, confused. doris stared down dennis.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{honey? please don’t speak that way. they don’t—}
<C>__{dennis}

<D>__{i’m coming right now!}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{i’ll tell you one thing. this "affirmative blaction" shit is driving me up the fuckin’ wall.}
<C>__{dennis}
<P>__{(taking a bite)}
<D>__{firefighters getting’ 99’s on their tests while rappers who score a goddamn 62 walk away with the job.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{don’t we have to have "affirmative action?"}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{not when a job requires ability. no.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{a lot of people would say otherwise.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{oh yeah? if dad’s fightin’ a brush fire... surrounded by thousand degree flames... who would you want watchin’ his back? a guy who scores a 99 or a guy who scores a sixty?}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{you’d want the best man for the job.}
<C>__{dennis}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you’re absolutely right, derek.}
