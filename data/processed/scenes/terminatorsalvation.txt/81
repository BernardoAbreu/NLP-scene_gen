<L>__{interior command center conference area day}
<A>__{densely marked maps on a conference table. connor is now flanked by a couple of senior advisors, older military men along with kate brewster, late 30s, now his wife and visibly pregnant. she's poring over faxes of the x ray images. (like connor, all military personnel here favor casual dress, at most pins or patches to indicate rank.)}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{he's not a cyborg no blood, no human tissue over the endoskeleton.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{besides, the first t 800s won't be manufactured until `26. advisor #1 maybe he's a one off, an experiment. advisor #2 let's hope. if there are more out there like him, we're in serious trouble. christ, a terminator with attitude...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{where did they find him? advisor #1 east central texas, near an area of heavy skynet concentration. the outpost where they're holding him is reasonably secure, but it's not much more than a commune.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{i want him extracted. advisor #1 done. what then?}
<A>__{connor picks up the faxes, disturbed by them.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{get him to our best people for disassembly, find out what makes him tick. we need to get into that metal skull, crack his cpu at all costs.}
<A>__{the advisors nod, pick up their papers and exit. as soon as they're gone, connor sits wearily in a chair, tosses the x rays and papers onto the table, his authoritative mask slipping. kate touches his arm. he leans his head against her pregnant belly.}
<C>__{connor }
<D>__{kate, why did i become leader of the resistance?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{because people trust you... you give them faith }
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{no. because i knew i would be, i was told. i know when and where the major battles are going to take place. i know i'm going to send my own father back through time to save my mother even though i haven't met him yet. christ, i even know the year i'm going to die...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{john }
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{so how could i not know about this?!}
<A>__{he bangs his fist on the table atop the papers.}
