<L>__{exterior forest glade day}
<A>__{water gurgles from a rock that is captive in the roots of an ancient oak. lancelot, in armor, reclines against its trunk, the roots cradling him. he is perfectly still, drawing life from the vibrant, all enfolding forest. flower petals drift on the breeze. trees sigh. fox and rabbit, sparrow and hawk, at peace with each other, watch over the knight.}
<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{a horse and rider tear through the thick undergrowth. it is guenevere. the forest races past her as she gallops toward the glade, brambles tearing at her flesh and clothes.}
