<A>__{stillwater's own record spins, and it sounds good to everyone in this room. russell takes a seat near the open mike. jeff bebe is quick to take the other seat, arranging himself to be just as close to the microphone as russell. william watches all as he sits at the dark back of this control booth. stillwater sits with late night progressive disc jockey quince allen, 25. quince takes a long hit from a joint and does not pass it. the entire stillwater band is now collected in the studio and ready for the interview. william can't avoid looking at penny lane, who looks great tonight. she catches him, and he barely looks away in time. polexia, newly reconciled with jeff, notices. the very mellow disc jockey eases up to the microphone, as the finale of "fever dog" is just ending.}
