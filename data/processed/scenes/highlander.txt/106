<L>__{exterior clearing night}
<A>__{dupont drags the corpse across the meadow and dumps it into a swamp.}
<L>__{interior cathedral night}
<A>__{it is very late. only a few officers are seated in the pews. dupont tries to concentrate on prayer, but is distracted.}
<C>__{mulet}
<P>__{(voice flashback)}
<D>__{you see major? you are not so different...}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{i had no choice.}
<A>__{dupont sighs and looks to the altar.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{who am i deceiving?}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{certainly not me.}
<A>__{dupont whirls around to see the knight, dressed as he in uniform, sitting one row behind. dupont leaps to his feet.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{you needn't look so flushed, major. you are quite safe in church.}
<A>__{dupont eases his breathing.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{state of grace and all that.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{tradition.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{it's all we have.}
<A>__{dupont has backed up a few paces.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{all this time and still a scared little boy.}
<A>__{dupont sits down.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{not so scared.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{perhaps not.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you seem to have misplaced a private. no doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{no doubt.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{you surprise me. eliminating a rival like that. such are the actions of a man of conquest. i was mistaken. 300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit ion.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{you're wrong.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{i know you very well, conor macleod. and i can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you. mulet, romirez, they were fools without vision. it was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.}
<A>__{the knight almost seems proud of dupont.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{romirez understood. not you.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{romirez is dust.}
<A>__{the knight looks to the altar.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{finish your prayers?}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{finish yours?}
<C>__{knight}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{our common heritage.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i am your only real friend, you know. the only one who truly understands you.}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{i look forward to the day we meet again. and i kill you.}
<C>__{dupont}
<D>__{so sure?}
<A>__{the knight leans forward and puts his face very near.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{you can't stay in church forever.}
<A>__{the knight moves into the aisle.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{good night, major.}
<A>__{he exits. conor sits in the dim church alone. very alone.}
