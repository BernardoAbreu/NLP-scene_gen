<D>__{anita married in stockholm in 1967. it's recorded in the swedish general register. but the family never knew, did they.}

<D>__{i'm guessing she then came here on a passport in her married name, and you followed on her maiden name passport.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{actually, it was the other way around. she thought it safer for me to travel with spencer myself.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{what did he think about that?}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{nothing. only that he loved her. she said, if you love me, you'll do this and not ask why. he never did.}

<D>__{would he? i don't know. i almost told him. but i was afraid because of what i did.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you still don't understand?}
<A>__{he doesn't. she studies him, and perhaps sees in him what salander did long ago that he can be trusted.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{a year after the first time after many times during that year my father got drunker than usual one night and started bragging about women he'd killed. he quoted from the bible as he tore off my clothes. he wrapped a belt around my neck. he wanted to kill me.}
