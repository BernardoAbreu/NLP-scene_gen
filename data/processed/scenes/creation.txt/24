<L>__{exterior by the river bank. the past. day}
<A>__{cut to the air above the picnickers alive with glittering particles against the dark trees behind.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{....so much beauty for so little purpose.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{surely not without purpose. they were helping to light the ship's way were they not.}
<A>__{darwin smiles at the idea, turns to innes}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{are you familiar with the works of thomas malthus, mr innes?.}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{he married his first cousin didn't he?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{so did charles.... so did i.}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{oh, i was not at all suggesting....}
<A>__{emma waves it away. just teasing}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{he made the point that if every trout, say, has a hundred offspring and so on and so on through the generations. then the planet would be knee deep in trout in just a few decades.}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{of course most of the eggs are destroyed and eaten so the numbers remain stable. that is the beauty of god's plan.}
<A>__{emma gives darwin a "so there" look and hands innes a sandwich.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{cheese and cucumber}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{thank you}
<A>__{somewhere in the woods, annie has found a treasure trove of worms and slugs.}
<C>__{annie }
<D>__{over here ....there are millions!}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{it doesn't strike you as an exceedingly wasteful plan these myriad lives created only to be immediately extinguished.}
<C>__{emma}
<P>__{(a gentle warning)}
<D>__{charles....}
<C>__{innes}
<P>__{(confidently)}
<D>__{they are providing food for others.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{you think they are happy about it?}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{happy?}
<A>__{close up on a writing worm. hooker is instructing george how to put a worm on a hook.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{through his bottom and up though his mouth perfect}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{....to be doing gods will.}
<C>__{emma}
<P>__{(to innes)}
<D>__{please ignore him. after two glasses of claret he tends to becomes mischievous.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{no i'm serious. if thousands are destroyed that a few may live their lives, is not the general sum total of happiness not in some kind of massive deficit?}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{well far be it from me to speculate on the mind of god, far less the happiness of an earthworm ha ha ha. but it seems to me that nature is at peace...and most of her denizens are content.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{amen.}
<C>__{innes}
<P>__{(to darwin)}
<D>__{you don't agree.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{i think it is a battlefield. a constant and shifting struggle for survival between everything and everything else.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i really do think men have a problem with natural beauty. they cannot ever just accept it for what it is.}
<P>__{(calls off)}
<D>__{children! sandwiches!}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{tell me of your wife mr innes.}
<A>__{darwin lies back on the rug and turns his head away from the sun. the base of a tangled hedgerow is just a few feet away. looking into its tangled depths he sees something gleaming white the skull of a sheep with briars growing through the eye sockets.}
