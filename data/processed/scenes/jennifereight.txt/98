<L>__{interior living room den. house. night.}
<A>__{a pause in the music amplifies conversation. bullshit and beer and everyone talking about nothing. bobby leads helena through the row. can't find berlin and now they're in the den. the ser ious guzzlers have made it base. everyone talking and everyone lying but no berlin and bobby is about to make a major mistake.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i will just go see if he's in the kitchen .. you stay right here ..}
<A>__{her protest is absorbed in sound. and anyway he's already gone. at once she is vulnerable. doesn't know if she's staring at the back of a head or straight into someone's face. "didn't we meet somewhere?" the question comes from the man with the scar. he's drunk as a dog and already got a tattooed hand around her waist.}
<C>__{venables}
<D>__{hey, popeye!}
<C>__{popeye}
<D>__{hey, fat guy! gimme 2 minutes. i'm about to ask this lady for a dance?}
<A>__{trash aftershave and lousy breath and clearly the answer is no.}
<D>__{if i told you i'd driven all the way from oakland would you dance with me?}
<A>__{willy nelson starts to sing. and helena attempts to break away.}
<D>__{what's so special about the other guy? you like cops, don't you .. i'm a cop ..}
<A>__{helena finds the top of a couch. holds it like a raft of secur ity. but where ever she goes this frightful mouth is following.}
<D>__{.. let me ask you a question? how do you know the difference between one guy and another? .. maybe you don't .. maybe you only know the "difference" when you're dancing? (he laughs) if you knew what i looked like, you'd dance with me. i look like john wayne ..}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i know what you look like. excuse me.}
<A>__{she navigates the back of the sofa. collides with somebody and apologizes. "i'm sorry. is anyone sitting there?" enough ambiv alence in the question for the guy not to know she's blind. no. no one sitting there. simultaneously a pair of middle age crew cuts occupy the sofa. a second later helena sits bang into one of the laps. spilt drinks and surprise all round. pleasant sur prise for the victim. he's a lecherous looking old bastard and helena's dress rides up for a damned good view of the lingerie.}
<C>__{fleshy voice}
<D>__{happy christmas, max ...}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i normally get socks ...}
<A>__{every humiliation there is. however helena gets out of this is however she achieves it. but by the time she does she's crying.}
