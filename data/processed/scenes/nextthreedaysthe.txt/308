<A>__{lara unsnaps her seat belt. she reaches for the door latch. john sees her pull the door and grabs her by the shirt as he slams his foot on the brakes! the tires scream, the suv skids into an uncontrolled turn. horns blare. cars behind them swerve to avoid collision. john holds lara in her seat as the suv flies around in a circle and finally comes to a dead stop on the shoulder, miraculously facing in the right direction. john allows himself to breathe. he lets go of lara's shirt. she opens the door and steps out. john closes his eyes and tries to gather himself back together. he opens his door and steps out.}
