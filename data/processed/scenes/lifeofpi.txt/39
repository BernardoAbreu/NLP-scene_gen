<D>__{animals don't think like we do; people who forget that get themselves killed. that tiger is not your friend. when you look into his eyes, you are seeing your own emotions reflected back at you nothing else.}

<D>__{selvam.}
<A>__{selvam opens the far gate. richard parker re enters the hallway. he sees the goat and slinks forward, lowering his body, his ears flattening against his skull. the goat freezes. everyone watches in silence, transfixed by the intensity of the tiger. pi watches the animal spirit glowing up within richard parker's eyes as instinct takes over. in a sudden, single burst, richard parker bolts the length of the hallway, claws reaching out through the bars of the cage toward the goat. we don't see what happens next but the family does. on the cage: only a few seconds have passed, but richard parker has already turned to go back into his enclosure, the lifeless goat in his mouth. the family watches father is impassive, ravi traumatized; mother wraps her arms around pi.}
