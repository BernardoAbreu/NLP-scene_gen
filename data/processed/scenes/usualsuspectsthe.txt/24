<L>__{20 mt. ocean}
<A>__{a half mile out from the pier. the sea is choppy, stirred by the wind. an object floats into view a few feet away, bobbing in the water. it is a dead body a man, face down, wearing a checkered bathrobe. he drifts quietly toward the open ocean.}
<L>__{interior hearing room day los angeles present 2:}
<A>__{verbal kint sits in a chair in front of a microphone attached to a tape recorder, his brow beaded with sweat. on the wall behind him is the seal of the state of california he is cleaner, better kept, in a well cut suit and neatly trimmed hair. he looks older than he did in new york worn down. a flurry of voices banter off screen. verbal's eyes follow the voices back and forth.}
<P>__{voice #1 (o.s.)}
<D>__{my client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. in exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.}
<P>__{voice #2 (o.s.)}
<D>__{the district attorney's office will comply provided voice #1 no provisions, nothing. my clients testimony for his immunity. voice #2 may i be frank, counselor? i suspect your political power as much as i respect it. i don't know why mr. kint has so many faceless allies in city hall, and i don't care. the embarrassment he helped cause the city of new york will not happen here. voice #1 immunity. voice #2 counselor, i will prosecute your client. voice #1 then prosecute. i will be very impressed to see if the district attorney manages to bring in twenty seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. i would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged "faceless people in city hall" you mention. voice #2 1 one would think the counsel is veiling a threat. voice #1 + counsel isn't veiling anything. voice #2 i'11 take my chances then. i'11 feel safer without a job if a man like mr. kint is behind bars. voice #1 mr. kint will plead guilty to weapons possession. voice #2 you're joking. voice #1 weapons. misdemeanor one. voice #2 counselor, you're insulting me. voice #1 counselor, you're bluffing. shall i push for misdemeanor two?}
<A>__{voices mumble off screen. verbal fidgets in his chair.}
<D>__{voice #2 + misdemeanor one. fine. this is ludicrous.}
<A>__{a tiny smile and a genuine look of disbelief flash across verbal's face.}
<P>__{voice #2 (cont'd) (clearing throat)}
<D>__{as for the rest of the charges grand larceny, arson... murder the district attorney will accept the subject's testimony in connection with the above mentioned events and in exchange will offer complete immunity. the transcript... the transcript of said testimony will be sealed and all matters incriminating to mr. kint will be rendered inadmissible.}
<A>__{verbal lets out a long held sigh of relief.}
