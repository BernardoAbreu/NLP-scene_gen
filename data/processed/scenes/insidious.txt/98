<L>__{interior dalton's bedroom day}
<A>__{the door groans open. dalton is lying on his gurney, surrounded by the sluggish drone of hospital equipment. the curtains are drawn and the room is dark. elise hesitates...then steps inside.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{leave the lights off.}
<A>__{elise steps closer to dalton. she runs her hands over his prone body. she shivers as she does. a ripple of fear passes through her. her breath quickens. slowly...very very slowly ...she gazes up at a corner of the ceiling. her eyes widen and the look on her face}
<C>__{should}
<C>__{be}
<C>__{absolute}
<B>__{t e r r o r.}
<A>__{her arm raises up, her finger extending and pointing at the corner she is glaring at.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{what is it? what do you see?}
<A>__{elise cups her hand over her mouth and whispers to specs, keeping her eyes glued to the far corner of the ceiling. we cannot hear what she is whispering. hand shaking, specs feverishly starts to sketch. we cannot see what he is drawing.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{what do you see?!}
<A>__{the strokes of specs' pencil become faster and rougher, keeping up with elise's whispers. sweat dots his forehead. tucker glances at the drawing and steps back instinctively. he holds up his viewmaster. pov through viewmaster we see the far corner of the ceiling change color as tucker rotates the lenses inside...but nothing out of the ordinary appears. just a ceiling.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{tell me!}
<A>__{suddenly, renai charges forward, snatching the sketch book. the drawing is of a hideous form crouched in the corner of the ceiling, staring down at dalton below. it is the red faced demon lorraine saw earlier. his naked body is charcoal black...whilst also strangely translucent, the veins visible underneath the flesh. a corpulent stomach juts out, as if he were pregnant. terrified, renai flicks on the light revealing nothing but an ordinary ceiling.}
