<L>__{exterior desert road}
<A>__{an old marker, jutting on an angle at the side of the road, reads: adobe flat. beneath it an arrow points ahead. macreedy steers the jeep up the narrow, rutted trail between a serious of enormous boulders.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as he drives to the far end of the boulders, reaching a flat piece of land completely surrounded by rocks. beyond the rocks is what remains of a burned out ranch house, and an abandoned well.}
<B>__{out}
<A>__{sequence from original script. med. shot macreedy in the wreckage. the remains of an iron bed. the burned out shell of a pick up truck. part of a stove. a morass of bottles, all sizes and shapes, some of them broken. macreedy halts momentarily beside the well. reaching out he touches the warped sun beaten boards that cover the mouth. he removes one, and, picking up a pebble, drops it through the opening. there is a long beat and then, from far, far below we hear a faint plunk (o.s.). he replaces the board and walks to a broken wall. he touches the burned out frame of a picture. the frame falls to the ground, leaving an un scorched square on the surface of the wall. he goes past a solitary standing stone chimney. suddenly he halts, arrested by something among the rubble, the rottenness and the ashes. reverse angle what he sees surrounded by the seared and blackened earth is a rectangular patch of lovely wild flowers.}
<B>__{back to macreedy}
<A>__{studying the brightly colored flowers. his face is lined in thought. he stoops, gathers a few buds in his hand. he examines them, his brow furrowed. as he slowly twirls a flower between thumb and forefinger, camera pans from macreedy in a long slow arc, taking in miles and miles of barren wasteland. camera rises, tilting upward to a cliff far away and shielded from macreedy's view by the intervening rocks and ridges.}
