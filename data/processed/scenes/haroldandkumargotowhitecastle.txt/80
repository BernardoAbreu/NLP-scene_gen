<A>__{suddenly, they see an old pick up truck driving in their direction. harold and kumar wave it down. the truck stops in front of them. the door opens and a shadowy figure begins walking towards them. harold and kumar are nervous. as soon as the figure reaches them, lightening strikes. it's the ugliest man of all time he's in his fifties, wearing a crappy mesh cap, but most notably, he has large bumps and boils all over his face. harold and kumar jump back in fear as they catch their first glimpse of him.}
<C>__{ugly man}
<D>__{you boys need some help?}
<A>__{the ugly man takes off his mesh cap. even his haircut is freaky. he has a skullet (a mullet but with no hair on top). harold and kumar look at each other, freaked out.}
