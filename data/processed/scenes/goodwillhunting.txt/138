<A>__{will sits across from two n.s.a. agents, oliver dytress and robert tavano. these guys are smug, clean cut, gung ho and looking sharp in twin navy blue suits.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{so why do you think i should work for the national security agency?}
<C>__{dytress}
<D>__{well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. you'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. super string theory, chaos math, advanced algorithms }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{codebreaking.}
<C>__{dytress}
<D>__{that's one aspect of what we do.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{come on, that's what you do. you handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. you're seven times the size of the c.i.a.}

<C>__{will}
<D>__{why shouldn't i work for the national security agency? that's a tough one.}
<A>__{will bites his tongue, trying to make this work.}
