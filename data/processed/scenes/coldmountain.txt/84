<L>__{exterior veasey town. night}
<A>__{inman leads the horse, with veasey ahead of him, hands tied behind his back, desperate for a reprieve.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{i'm begging you. it's better you blowout my brains than return me to this place.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{where does she live?}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{in our house. she sleeps in our kitchen. you don't know me, friend, but the good lord punished me with want. i am all appetite. that's all i do all day is want: food, the female parts...}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{shut your mouth. i don't want a sermon every time i ask a question.}
<A>__{they're in the town's main drag now. there's a chapel and next to it, a small house.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{this your place?}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{dear god of misery.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{you're going to put her back where she sleeps.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{i do that the members will lynch me. consorting with a nigger, adultery, siring a bastard while serving as their preacher. we're a strict congregation we've churched men for picking up a fiddle on the sabbath.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{so you reckoned to kill her.}
<A>__{disgusted, inman approaches the front door of the house.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{there's a back door. have pity.}
<A>__{and he leads inman down a side path.}
