<L>__{exterior venice, grand canal day}
<A>__{a beauty shot of the grand canal: magnificent palaces and churches soar upwards on either side in all their glory. push in on a launch labelled danieli, travelling fast over the water. cara shakes her head to let the wind ruffle her hair. camera continues past her to reveal frank, clutching the railing beside her, afraid to wake up.}
<L>__{interior danieli hotel, entrance hall day}
<A>__{frank leads us through the distinctive, revolving glass door into the low ceilinged entrance lobby. discover cara at the desk talking to the receptionist.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{you have a booking in the name of mason.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{si, signorina.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{signora. that's my husband.}
<A>__{she nods at frank. for a second, the receptionist cannot keep the surprise out of his eyes. this glamorous, superbly dressed creature is married to a dull, american tourist in a t shirt? he recovers his composure and alters his manner at once.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{very good, senora mason. welcome to the danieli. you are in the doge's our premiere suite.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{is there anything special you require?}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{have a copy of today's herald tribune sent up to the room please.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{my pleasure, signora.}
<A>__{he gives her a large gold key and nods to a porter to take the luggage. frank hurries to catch up with her. the receptionist he watches them go.}

<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{mother of god, what a waste.}
