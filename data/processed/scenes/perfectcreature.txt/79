<L>__{int: ceremonial chapel day}
<A>__{an ornate door; ancient, with strange, beautiful dark symbols carved into the old wood, like something out of a castle in prague. the doors open and we see a large chapel. and within the large dark interior, lit by great long candles, the brotherhood have gathered. they all stare at the camera, which we reveal is silus' pov. we see silus. unchanged, still the perfect creature he has always been. but for now the suit has gone and instead he stands draped in fine ropes, robes that carry his life on them; achievements, his rank, which is now high. in the distance, at an alter, stands augustus. he is also in his gowns. a gong sounds and the brothers, in unison with the music, begin to chant; it is eerie, it sounds like tibetan monks.}
