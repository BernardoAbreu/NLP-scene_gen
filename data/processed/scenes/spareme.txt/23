<L>__{interior buzz's house, kitchen}
<A>__{the blender is wailing at high speed as millie throws in a whole box of laxative, a can of drano and a jar of pills. her hands are trembling.}
<L>__{interior buzz's house, living room}
<A>__{millie walks into the living room with a silver tray holding two orange whips; one thick and deadly, the other thin and safe. there is laughter coming from both men.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{and the irony is, thirty years later, that prick is bowling in the seniors on tv all over the world, and look at me. ah well. the docs made me stop, on account of my ticker.}
<P>__{(taps his chest)}
<D>__{i don't really miss it, but then...}
<P>__{(chokes up)}
<D>__{...i miss it.}
<A>__{he spies millie approaching with the tray.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. thanks sweetie. millie turns the tray so that buzz takes the untainted whip. theo takes the other glass.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{zeus}
<D>__{zeus is on the sofa, growling and tugging at theo's bowling bag. the bag rips apart and the ball hits the floor.}
<C>__{orange whip}
<D>__{theo brings the drink to his lips. the ball rolls across the room.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{the ball rolls into buzz's feet.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{this your lucky bullet?}
<A>__{buzz picks it up and reads the writing on the ball. he snaps a look into the kitchen, seeing the empty drano and laxative cartons. buzz slams the drink away from theo's lips. the drink explodes across the room. buzz is up on his feet.}
<C>__{buzz}
<P>__{(with intensity)}
<D>__{where'd you get this ball?}
<C>__{theo}
<P>__{(stunned looks at the mess on the floor, then at buzz)}
<D>__{it's mine.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{who gave it to you?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{grace skinner.}
<C>__{buzz}
<P>__{(astonished)}
<D>__{grace skinner. who's grace skinner to you?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{she's my mom.}
<A>__{theo stands and takes the ball from buzz's hands. buzz is in shock, staring at theo.}
<C>__{buzz}
<P>__{(regaining his voice)}
<D>__{who are you? who sent you here?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{i'm your son. you're a hard father to find.}
<C>__{millie}
<D>__{son?}
<C>__{buzz}
<P>__{(to millie)}
<D>__{millie, please.}
<P>__{(to theo)}
<D>__{i don't have a son. i think you better leave now young man. buzz gestures towards the front door.}
<C>__{theo}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{grace skinner fazeli, you must remember her?}
<A>__{buzz takes theo by the elbow to eject him from the house.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i don't know no grace skinner.}
<C>__{theo}
<P>__{(pulls his arm away)}
<D>__{you knew her. you married her in 1963.}
<C>__{millie}
<D>__{married?}
<A>__{buzz grabs a large bowling trophy and waves it at theo.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{you're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. you got no right to be here! theo yanks the trophy away from buzz.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{i got a right. you're my father.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i ain't nobody's father!}
<A>__{theo hurls the trophy at buzz. he ducks and the trophy sails into a large glass trophy case. broken glass and trophies fly everywhere.}
<C>__{millie}
<P>__{(noticing zeus)}
<D>__{zeus!}
<A>__{zeus is laid out cold near the spilled orange whip on the living room floor. millie hunches over her comatose poodle.}
<C>__{millie}
<D>__{my poor baby!}
<C>__{buzz}
<P>__{(to theo)}
<D>__{you see what you did?}
<P>__{(he picks up the ball)}
