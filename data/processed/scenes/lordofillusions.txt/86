<A>__{a wonderland for illusionists. books, props, masks, tricks, etc. two or three customers browse. harry glances at them all, then targets a man in late middle age, who is browsing through books, one handed. his other hand constantly manipulates a card, concealing and revealing it in a dozen ways. he doesn't even look at his hand. his name is walter}
