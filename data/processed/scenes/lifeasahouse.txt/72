<L>__{exterior george's beach shack afternoon}
<A>__{george gathers a pile of splintered boards and tosses them into the dumpster. he works while guster sleeps.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{the sun is fierce, low on the horizon with a heat that distorts the distance. george is sweating and shirtless as sam walks out of the garage with the gloves on and stands staring at his father. after a beat, george notices him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i have to pay back what you flushed down the toilet.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i want ten dollars an hour...then i'm done.}
<A>__{george nods. he points out the roofless shell of a shack.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it all has to come down before we can start again.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{knock it down.}
<A>__{george picks up a sledghammer and hands it to sam. sam hoists the hefty hammer and with some true effort, slams it on a sideboard. he slams again and again as george picks up a slightly smaller sledgehammer.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{i hated this house from the second my father cheated everyone and put it in my name.}
<A>__{george takes a good hard whack at the wall, knocking a huge hunk of it down. sam stops to watch.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are. this is the end of it, sam. i'm gonna build something of me here that i can be proud to give to you.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{don't. i don't want it.}
<A>__{george yells as he lands the hammer into the wall again. sam is alarmed by his father's blatant rage.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{do whatever you want with it. i don't care. all i want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we haven't build shit. you're just tearing down your father.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{try it. it feels good.}
<A>__{george strikes another blow to the house joined with a mad wail. sam starts low, a whisper of a scream, but quickly builds, soon rivaling george in volume as he pounds away. this soul letting, cleansing ritual is both impelling and frightening to watch. tom and barbara, colleen and her maid step out of their houses, drawn and perplexed by the guttural noise.}
