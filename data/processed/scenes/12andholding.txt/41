<L>__{interior doctor's office moments later}
<A>__{patrick and grace sit across from the doctor (50's).}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{leonard has a condition. it's called anosmia.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{oh my god! is it serious?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{no. anosmia is when a person looses their sense of smell. it's not uncommon in patients who suffer serious head injuries. unfortunately, it's also affecting his ability to taste. again, not uncommon.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{is it permanent?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{depends on the patient.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what do we do? he can't eat.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{he can eat. he just can't taste what he's eating.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{what she means is, he won't eat.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{leonard's association with food is no longer about taste. it's about texture. while we may be partial to sweet or salty foods, leonard will become partial to crunchy or smooth ones. once he settles on a texture he likes, his appetite will increase.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i can't believe this is happening.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{considering what leonard could have suffered, he's lucky. besides, he is severely overweight. a loss of appetite may be a benefit.}
<A>__{grace and patrick shoot him a look of death.}
