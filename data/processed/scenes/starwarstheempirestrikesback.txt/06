<L>__{interior hoth rebel base command center}
<A>__{a makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick ice. the low ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. controllers, troops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and monitoring radar signals. general rieekan straightens up from a console at han's approach.}
<C>__{rieekan}
<D>__{solo?}
<C>__{han}
<A>__{no sign of life out there, general. the sensors are in place. you'll know if anything comes around.}
<C>__{rieekan}
<D>__{commander skywalker reported in yet?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{no. he's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.}
<C>__{rieekan}
<P>__{(indicates radar screen)}
<D>__{with all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.}
<A>__{taking a deep breath, han blurts out what is on his mind.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{general, i've got to leave. i can't stay anymore.}
<A>__{princess leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short white combat jacket and pants. her hair is braided across her head in a nordic fashion. she overhears their conversation and seems somewhat distressed.}
<C>__{rieekan}
<D>__{i'm sorry to hear that.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{well, there's a price on my head. if i don't pay off jabba the hut, i'm a dead man.}
<C>__{rieekan}
<D>__{a death mark's not an easy thing to live with. you're a good fighter, solo. i hate to lose you.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{thank you, general.}
<A>__{he turns to leia as rieekan moves away.}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(with feeling)}
<D>__{well, your highness, i guess this is it.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{leia is angry. han sees she has no warmth to offer him. he shakes his head and adopts a sarcastic tone.}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(cooly)}
<D>__{well, don't get all mushy on me. so long, princess.}
<A>__{han walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center. leia stews a moment, then hurries after him.}
