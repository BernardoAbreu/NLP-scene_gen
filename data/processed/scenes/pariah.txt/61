<L>__{exterior liquor store continuous}
<A>__{arthur shouts a greeting to mack who lounges on a plastic chair outside his door. sock and two other men chit chat nearby. their chatter lowers as arthur approaches. alike bops into the store.}

<C>__{alike}
<D>__{hey mr. ferguson!}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{i see alike's been running circles around you again!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{little bit, little bit. i still got it though.}
<A>__{arthur claps mack on the shoulder and glimpses sock whispering to one of the men. arthur follows the men's gazes over to alike at the potato chip rack. she twirls the string of her basketball shorts round and round her finger and idly hikes the collar of her t shirt up over her nose. the smile evaporates from arthur's face. sock peers back at him, smirking. arthur starts toward him, when alike saunters out between them.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{we better get going.}
<C>__{mack }
<D>__{gone already?}
<C>__{arthur}

<D>__{get in the car.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{but you said i could drive }
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i said get in the car!}
<A>__{alike frowns, then catches sight of the men in front of the store. she slumps into the car and slams the door. arthur piles into the driver's seat. they sit in silence for a moment, alike traces the lines in her hands.}
