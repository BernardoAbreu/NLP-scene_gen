<A>__{standing on the rim of the gorge, the star man sees the rays of his pursuers' flashlights choking off any possible escape. he eases jenny to the ground behind a boulder. she whimpers with the pain.}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(strokes her cheek)}
<D>__{you will be all right.}
<A>__{he stretches over the top of the boulder and scatters four shots at the lights.}
<L>__{exterior trees night}
<A>__{the patrolmen, the technicians and shermin all hit the ground and kill their lights.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{mrs. haydn, we don't want to hurt you. put down your gun and come out. we just want to talk to your friend.}
<B>__{the star man and jenny}
<A>__{the star man peers around the boulder. at that instant the searchlight from the helicopter happens to splash across the men in the field. he sees that their guns are drawn and pointed in his direction. the star man pulls back and takes a marble from his pouch. it grows and glows gold as the star man rolls it between his palms. when it reaches the size of a baseball, he clutches it firmly in his right hand and empties the .45 toward shermin and the police. this time, there is a barrage of answering fire. with the bullets ricocheting around him, the star man lifts jenny to his shoulder. he massages the golden orb until it becomes the size of a soccer ball, then takes two quick steps to the edge of the cliff and leaps into the abyss.}
