<L>__{interior a large barren room day}
<A>__{an office comes off it at one end. judging from the fluorescent lights overhead and the scattered cue racks which still hang tenuously on the walls, the place, indeed, used to be a pool hall. niles and garfield go all the way to the back, while twist stays near the front with the old man.}
<C>__{niles}
<D>__{looks all right. it's big enough and off the street.}
