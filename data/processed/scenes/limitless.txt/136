<L>__{exterior fifth avenue day}
<A>__{lindy bolts from the cab just as tan coat puts his hand on the opposite door. she takes off into central park. and he's after her like a shot.}
<L>__{exterior central park day}
<A>__{lindy veers off the path, through the trees, zig zagging, trying to find a place not to be seen.}
<C>__{tan coat}
<A>__{zig zags too, not far behind her.}
<C>__{lindy}
<A>__{begins to scream, desperate:}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{help! help!!}
<A>__{up ahead, miraculously, a cop on horseback. he steps the horse toward her. she races over and presses her body against the side of the horse. she's so panicked and out of breath she can barely speak.}
<C>__{lindy }
<D>__{there's... a... man... chasing me. he has a long, tan }
<A>__{the cop seems to be paying attention, then suddenly grunts and twitches, his eyes flutter, glaze... and he topples off his horse to the ground... ...revealing tan coat, on the other side of the horse. the blade in his hand is bloody. lindy runs.... tries to lose herself in a wedding party... comes to a section of huge, decorative boulders and rocks. dives behind one of them. ahead, she can see the outdoor ice skaters, couples, families, enjoying the ice. it seems surreal. several yards behind her is tan coat, looking behind every tree, every trash bin. lindy picks up the phone, keeping her voice low, although she's hyperventilating.}
<C>__{lindy }
<D>__{are you still there?}
<A>__{and we cross cut between:}
