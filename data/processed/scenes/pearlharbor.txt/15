<D>__{whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it. or it wouldn't be so hard to say.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{the only reason it's hard to say is that i keep thinking i don't have the right to say it. but i've got to because it's true. i love you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that must surprise you.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{it surprises me that i'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.}
<A>__{the power of hearing this from each other grips them both.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{there's one thing i have to say. i'm going away.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{we're all going away.}
<C>__{rafe}

<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{evelyn...you know the line let's make tonight memorable. what i feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that. if i don't come back, i don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i don't know if you can choose that, rafe.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{maybe not. but i need you to know. i love you. and i will come back. i will find a way. and then we'll get a chance to know if what i felt the first moment i saw you, and every minute since then, is real.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{do one thing for me, before you go.}
<A>__{she takes his hand and leads him inside.}
