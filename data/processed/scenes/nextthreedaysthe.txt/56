<L>__{exterior brooklyn, new york street day}
<A>__{john gets out of a cab and heads into a local dive bar.}
<L>__{interior bar day}
<A>__{a couple of guys at the bar yell at the dog race on the tv screen. damon hands john a beer and nods toward a table.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's a course that investigates what drives men to be free, no matter the cost.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{somebody else had dibs on papillon?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you escaped from jail seven times.}
<A>__{damon lights a cigarette. a tough guy nearby objects.}
<C>__{tough guy}
<D>__{no smoking!!}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{yeah, who would want to cut short your precious life?}
<A>__{damon takes a deep drag.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{mind if i tape you?}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{go for it, it can't be used as evidence. what do you want to know?}
<A>__{john sets up the small digital recorder.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{how you escaped when no one else could.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{balls and a little luck.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no prison in the world is airtight. each one has a key. you have to find it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{how do you do that?}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{a lot of looking. especially at things that break the daily routine. guards get comfortable doing the same thing every day. something happens where they have to think, adapt.}
<C>__{damon }
<D>__{that's when they will make mistakes. but when you see it you have to be ready. you have to have the entire plan already in place before you even know how you are going to get out of the jail. escaping is easy; the hardest part is staying free.}
