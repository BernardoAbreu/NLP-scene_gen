<A>__{he is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine. as the camera pulls closer, we see that austin is reaching deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange diode in place with an odd style soldering iron. the connection breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the machine and start smoking and sputtering. as the smoke grows thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.}

<A>__{austin pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part. the camera follows austin's arm into the chassis, where smoke surrounds it and clouds over everything. the buzzing sound grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing engines. slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice crackling over a radiophone.}

<A>__{suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of b 17 bombers come tearing out into the moonlit night.}
