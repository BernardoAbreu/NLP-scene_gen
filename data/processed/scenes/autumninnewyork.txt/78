<A>__{as charlotte enters, we hear wills' cab pull away. she moves to the stairs and sees a light shining beneath the living room door.}
<L>__{interior brownstone living room same}
<A>__{dolores sits watching an old movie, her eyes dulled by a cataract of boozy fatigue. the door opens. she looks up and sees charlotte in costume.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{well, if it ain't the belle of amherst.}
<A>__{charlotte smiles feebly and plops down on the cracked leather ottoman. she looks blankly at the tv. she sniffles and wipes a hand across her nose. dolores glances over, then back at the set.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{seen that face before.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{you have?}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{and for the same god damn reason.}
<A>__{charlotte is confused, but then puts it together }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{but you said wills and my mom were just friends.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{sure, but she was nuts about him. the only reason she didn't sleep with him is 'cause she was sentimental. and smart. she wanted a ring first.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{why didn't he give her one?}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{'cause he knocked up little millie tyler instead. in newport. at bailey's beach. during the labor day clam bake.}
<A>__{she chuckles grimly, coughs, and sips her drink.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{millie was your mom's best friend from nightingale. you had to hand it to him. he sure knew how to make a pointerior}
<A>__{she coughs again. charlotte struggles to make sense of it all.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{why did he do that?}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{aw, who the hell knows? 'cause the moon was full. 'cause life's short. 'cause he's wills keane. i will tell you a little secret after that, your mom hated his guts, but your dad never made her smile like he did.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{'course your dad never made her cry like that either.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me any of this before?}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{oh, i dunno...}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{you never talk to me! you never try to help me!}
<A>__{dolores' eyes grow nervous. she swallows hard.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{christ, look at me. i'm gonna tell you what to do?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{yes! you're my family. you're supposed to take care of me.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{aw, you wouldn't listen. that's the thing about people they just do what they want from the day they're born till the day they die.}
<A>__{she realizes her poor choice of words. she looks over and their eyes collide. charlotte begins to cry }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{no, that's you, dolly! people who have given up don't listen to other people! people who want to die close off! that's not me! i wanted your help! i wanted to learn!}
<A>__{charlotte drops her head dejectedly.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{anything... anything you would ever have told me, i would have listened to! i promise.}
<C>__{dolly}
<P>__{(fighting tears)}
<D>__{aw, come on, honey. i can throw a party and i can mix a gimlet. after that, what the fuck do i know?}
<A>__{she rises, gives charlotte a nervous, awkward pat on the shoulder, then crosses over to the bar.}
