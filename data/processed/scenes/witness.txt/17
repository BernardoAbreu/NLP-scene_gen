<L>__{exterior philadelphia slums}
<A>__{as the train travels past dilapidated row houses, streets choked with cars and the gutters with filth.}
<L>__{interior train (moving)}
<A>__{now samuel is staring out the window with some confusion, almost apprehension:}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{is this where we're going?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{of course not. we're going to baltimore. it's much nicer in baltimore.}
<A>__{and rachel draws her son closer, turning her back on the window.}
<L>__{interior 30th st. station, philadelphia day}
<A>__{rachel is in a line at one of the counters. the plain dress of the two amish particularly samuel's black coat and hat are drawing curious stares.}
<B>__{samuel}
<A>__{he's uncomfortably aware of the shy looks and giggles of a little girl about his own age, standing in line with her parents at the next counter. he edges away from his mother...}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{as samuel comes upon a figure garbed in a long black frock coat and flat brimmed hat... the man's back is turned, could, from appearances, be an amishman. samuel stares... a beat, the man turns to face samuel and we discover that he is a hasidic jew.}
<B>__{samuel}
<A>__{as he reacts.}
<B>__{back to ticket counter}
<A>__{as rachel's turn arrives. the ticket seller glances up and she shows him her ticket.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{we have a ticket to baltimore. where is that train, please?}
<C>__{ticket seller}
<D>__{delayed three hours. you'll hear an announcement when it's time to board.}
<A>__{he starts to go without his hat, but rachel collars him and puts it on his head. angle in men's room as samuel enters. it's a long row of sinks, urinals, and stalls... samuel stops before one of the urinals a long, trough like affair with water drizzling down the rear porcelain panel. it's set a little high for samuel, and it is making glugging flushing noises that are, at least, intimidating. samuel stares for a moment, then turns, looks toward the stalls, stoops to see which are empty.}
<B>__{his pov toilets}
<A>__{beneath the row of doors we can see no feet visible. samuel is alone in the restroom.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{as samuel proceeds along the row of door, finally selects a stall near the end. he enters. as he does so, a heavily bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters. with some urgency, he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind a paper towel dispenser. suddenly he glances up. two other men have entered the men's room; one is a large black man in a three piece suit under an expensive, overcoat. his partner is a caucasian in designer jeans, half boots and a short leather jacket. they advance on the young man with unmistakable menace. the young man whirls in terror; his two assailants lunge for him... a savage, wordless struggle ensues in the close confines of the lavatory. angle in samuel's stall as the struggling men bounce off the door of his stall... he can see their feet under the edge of the door.}
<B>__{back to fight}
<A>__{as the struggle builds to a climax... ends with the young man stiffening with a grunt, his face draining of color. the two attackers step away, the blade in the black man's hand bloodstained. his partner stares at what they've accomplished with a stunned expression:}
<C>__{partner}
<D>__{jesus...}
<A>__{the young man's hand comes away from his belly covered with blood. he stares at it, staggers toward the sinks. finally his bloodied hand reaches to smear at his face in the mirror. then he collapses to the floor. the black man motions for his partner to watch the door, then quickly reaches up and removes the notebook from behind the dispenser. angle in samuel's stall as he edges open the stall door a crack. over his shoulder we can see the black man, his back to us, rifling the backpack. but beyond him, in the mirror on the far wall, we catch sight of the black man's face.}
<B>__{samuel}
<A>__{as he stares out the narrow crack. a beat, then he closes the stall door.}
<B>__{angle in stall}
<A>__{samuel tries to make the latch work, but it's warped and won't fall closed.}
<B>__{black man}
<A>__{as he checks the notebook before placing it in his pocket. his partner is covering the door, an automatic in his hand. the black man makes for the exit, then on second thought, glances at the row of stalls.}
<B>__{his pov stalls}
<A>__{all quiet, but...}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{the black man whips out a .38 caliber revolver, and, starting at the near end, starts pushing open the stall doors. angle in sam's stall as the black man approaches, samuel working desperately on the latch. at the last minute he finally wedges it in.}
<B>__{black man}
<A>__{he elbows samuel's stall... the door won't open. angle in sam's stall fighting back panic, samuel has retreated as far as he can.}
<B>__{black man}
<A>__{as he gives the door a kick. it holds. he swears under his breath. angle in sam's stall in desperation, samuel does the only thing he can think of... he slips under the partition into the neighboring stall the black man just checked out. but he loses his hat in the process. his hand snakes back into frame to snatch it just as the black man gives the door a ferocious kick that splinters the lock and nearly takes it off its hinges. he's framed there, the big muzzle of the .38 revolver looking down our throats.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{as his partner snaps from the doorway:}
<C>__{partner}
<D>__{will you come on, for christ's sakes!}
<A>__{a beat, then the black man holsters his weapon, turns to follow the partner out.}
<B>__{back to samuel}
<A>__{as we hear the sound of the two men exiting the lavatory. a long beat, then samuel opens the stall door a crack.}
<B>__{his pow through door}
<A>__{samuel's own face reflected in the blood smeared mirror... then panning down to the still figure of the young man lying in the crimson pool of his own blood on the floor.}
<B>__{bench waiting room low angle night}
<A>__{samuel sits close to his mother, his face pale, his eyes staring. rachel holds his hand tightly in hers as the torsos of various police and officials pass through foreground, occasionally obscuring the lonely couple. there is considerable echoing noise as commands and requests mingle with the crackle of two way radios.}
