<L>__{interior kelvin's room}
<A>__{kelvin is asleep, rheya in his arms. he wakes up and looks at her, perplexed. after a beat he rises to sit on the edge of the bed. a wave of terror is barely suppressed as he puts his hand to his forehead. rheya opens her eyes.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{oh, god. i'm awake.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{he looks at her.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{where did you come from?}
<A>__{she moves to him and kisses him as if that's all she wants to do, forever. between kisses.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{how are you here?}
<A>__{she stops.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{how do you mean?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{chris, what's wrong?}
<A>__{hearing his name spoken by her (and those particular words, perhaps) nearly causes kelvin to scream. he stands and moves to the chair. rheya watches him.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{he looks up at her for as long as he can. then he looks down.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{do you love me?}
<A>__{he doesn't look up.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{i need to see snow.}

<D>__{don't.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{i don't know. i can't be alone.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{i will be right back.}
<A>__{she is trying to accommodate him but her fear of being left alone is palpable, even excessive. he sees this and puts his arms on her shoulders to comfort her.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{all right. all right. here.}
<A>__{he hands her a few pills and retrieves a glass of water.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{what are they?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{to calm your anxiety.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{to calm my anxiety.}
<A>__{she takes the pills and smiles.}
