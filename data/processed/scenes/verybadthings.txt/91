<D>__{dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and adam. out back we'd light 'em up. the three of us. we'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. sparks. and dad would be all... "get ready"... "watch for it"... "here it comes," here comes the "wahoo"}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{the wahoo?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter... and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. perfect. it would only last a second, but that second was it. it was it. that's what dad had us looking for... you get me?}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{the wahoo moment?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that's my point! you see man... burning at his absolute. to see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. that's what i'm driving at. you get me?}

<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i've been looking for that flash and i look and i look and i can't find it. and what if i already had it? you know. my moment? what if it's gone? and i never saw it?}
