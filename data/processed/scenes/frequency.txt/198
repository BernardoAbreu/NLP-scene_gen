<L>__{interior shepard's apartment west 74th st. day 1969}
<A>__{click, click dead bolt turning... front door opens and shepard walks in. his '69 apartment is far nicer than the place we just left john in '98. shepard runs to the bathroom. rips off the toilet's tank lid, reaches down and pulls out a .357 magnum colt python, wrapped in clear plastic. he rips off the plastic, shoves the pistol in his waistband, heads into the kitchen. he gropes behind the refrigerator, close on an envelope glass taped to back of the fridge. shepard's hand finds the envelope...he rips it loose. and then he opens it revealing its contents, souvenirs, polaroid photos of the nightingale murders, women's jewelry, newspaper clippings... shepard takes out a match to burn the photos. but then... the broom closet door bursts off its hinges. frank instantly on top of shepard. the souvenirs go flying in the air. frank pummels shepard's head and back. but shepard smashes his elbow in frank's adam's apple, lands a solid uppercut square on frank's nose. frank's eyes watering up, vision}
<B>__{blurring. close on}
<A>__{frank's hand, groping for the handle of a glass pitcher atop the kitchen counter. shepard reaches for his gun, points the .357 at frank's head. shepard's finger squeezing the trigger. it's over. but... frank smashes the glass pitcher down on shepard's skull. shepard drops. crack, the gun fires, blasting air. frank scrambles for the window. he's outta there, expertly thundering down fire escape.}
