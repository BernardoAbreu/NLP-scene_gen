<ACTION>__{Dark night.  Most street lights shot out.  Just one or two of the eerie vapor lights left on the block. A MIDDLE-AGED AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN carries his single bag of groceries.  The man listens and watches carefully, as he negotiates the darkness between the few pools of light on the street. We won't see his face until he reaches the next pool of light, but he walks with shoulders hunched in fear. Moving down the block, all shops abandoned.  Broken windows. Rats.  The man almost trips over a vague shadow passed out and crumpled in an abandoned doorway.  It's the crackhead we saw mumbling himself into the nod-off zone.  He's still faintly singing a part of the bones song as the man passes. He stops in the light. And we see it's SHOTGUN: 20 years of fear and loathing etched on his face.  He freezes, listening for a second to the crackheads wheezing mumbles - no - it's something else he's listening for -- and hearing. From behind him a low wheezy sound, like some huge panting dog.  He stops.  And it stops.  He walks on and it follows: As he hurries to the next pool of light and safety, his ears strain for the nearly silent padding and wheezing steadily following. Suddenly, he hears that panting closer and closer until it's nearly right behind him.  He starts running, though he hasn't yet seen anything.  Only heard the mongrel hot on his heels.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{FOLLOW WITH SHOTGUN}
<ACTION>__{As he stumbles, careens, and wheezes through the streets and alleys, terrified.  Winded, he eventually stops, his hand trembling into his shopping bag, seeking a weapon. And we see the building he's paused beside: Bones' place. Pockmarked by age.  Like the face of some furious old man. Now he can almost feel the dog's breath on the back of his neck...Shotgun spins, whipping a bottle of milk out of the bag and hurling it into the darkness behind him. The bottle smashes against the wall of Bones' building.  For a second, silhouetted against the now whited wall, the tall, too tall, shape of the skinny black dog. Without waiting to see what he hit, Shotgun takes off running to reach his building across the street.  The sound of the dog's nails skittering across the street right behind him -- -- and he just makes it --}

And in the flickering we see behind him that this room now contains a portion of hell: It's not just the chipped paint and peeled rotted wall paper, or the cracks and gaps in the broken old ceiling mirror. All surfaces seem to be a swirling, shifting pattern in which we can dimly and subliminally make out faces as if people were trapped on the surface of things.  Exactly like the glimpse we had beneath the world when Jimmy died... The floor, the walls, the furniture, everything in it -- made out of the wracked and twisted devouring and devoured forms of dead souls.  Their faces, hollow pleading eyes and howling mouths visible like flowing grain in wood. And in the center of it all stands the dark silhouette of Bones, impossibly tall and thin, stretching malevolently out across the room like a living shadow. But the boys don't see this as they're finding the door.  We see Bones shadow arching towards them while they fumble. Palmer finally opens the door to the sound of a deep rumbling growl from the darkness on the other side.  And in the open door stands the black dog. They boys jump back.  But breathes easy.}

As soon as he does, the dog releases Jason, and disappears as fast as it appeared, back into the darkness. The two kids panic, Jason shaking and bleeding, looking around, waiting for the dog or something else to attack, seeing back through the doorway into the room from hell. Behind them we see that tall man-shaped shadow.  The Bones shadow is oblivious to the two frantic boys, intent only on the small flickering flame of the lighter still burning where it fell against the lower wood paneling of the wall. A thin trail of black smoke as the flame barely begins to catch on the chipped lead-filled flammable paint.}

Other than a slightly blackened spot, the wall is unburned. The black shadow shudders in rage, arches back and hooooowls in frustration, its mouth abnormally large.  The shadowy head snaps in the direction of the boys -- ready to vent it's wrath, and for a subliminal second we see in the head, the hellish face of Jimmy Bones. The boys round the second floor landing and fly down the last flight of stairs. Jason's foot breaks through a rotted floorboard and for a second, it appears as though rotten hands are just below the stairs, grabbing at his foot and leg.

Then the faces and bodies begin to step out of their surfaces and into the room. So as Bill, eyes still closed, rocks to the hypnotic beats in his headphones, we see the room around him begin to fill with figures. -- all twisted dead human forms emerging out of the surfaces of floor and walls.

<DIAL>__{Ain't no Heaven.  Ain't no Hell.  There's just the world of the dead, my momma always talked about.  Like she said, the door is open, and we're seeing right through our world into this one.  We just have to remember what was really here. And follow it.  Those stairs should take us to the second floor.}
<ACTION>__{As they approach the stairs they can hear faintly above the drone/moan of the dead, the soft music playing in Bones' crib.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANGLE AS}
<ACTION>__{They start up the stairs into the darkness.  Patrick first, Cinnabar in between him and Bill.  Patrick still holding his flashlight, but it's starting to flicker a little. More of the same horror along the stairway walls, eyes looking at them, hands caress Cinnabar's hair, another hand shooting up from the stair floor and grabbing Bill's thigh. Bill stabs the hand with the knife on his belt.  And the hands shoot back down. BACK IN BONES' CRIB The Munch-like dance of death goes on, Bones stroking the back of her neck.}

<CHAR>__{PATRICK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shit.}
<ACTION>__{A faint sound: Patrick shaking the flashlight.  Nothing but the sound of breathing, both human and non-human.}
<CHAR>__{PATRICK } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Thing worked fine a minute ago. Batteries were brand new --}
<ACTION>__{Then as suddenly as it went out, the flashlight comes back on, illuminating a horrible sight: Maurice.  Standing right there, a few feet in front of them.}
<CHAR>__{BILL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maurice!}
<ACTION>__{Maurice puts a finger to his lips and beckons them to follow. The boys want it to be Maurice.  But Cinnabar knows better.}
<CHAR>__{CINNABAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's not Maurice --}
<ACTION>__{But with the beam of the flickering flashlight, they follow the shadowy figure up the steps. Then Maurice gets a bit to far ahead, and they can't see him for a beat.}
<CHAR>__{PATRICK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maurice.  Hold up, man.}
<ACTION>__{Then after a silent beat, just Maurice's hand appears back out of the darkness, beckoning them onward.  Then the flashlight cuts out again.  They're back in the darkness.}
<CHAR>__{PATRICK } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(as he shakes the flashlight)}
<DIAL>__{Okay, we're on the second floor.  I feel it.  No more steps.}
<ACTION>__{The sound of Patrick cursing and shaking the batteries around in the torch.  Eventually it comes on again. Up ahead, they still barely see Maurice, his back to them, face in one quarter profile, leading them towards the next flight of stairs at the end of the hall. They follow.  Closer and closer to the stairs, Maurice going eerily in and out of their vision.  The flashlight dies again. Darkness.  Patrick shakes it and it comes back quickly.  Then just as quickly dies again!  A shake and it's lit again -- just as Bill is stepping into the corner where Maurice disappeared.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{FLICKERING HORROR}
<ACTION>__{As the dog leaps at them from the corner, all teeth and slavering jaws!  Everyone scrambles for their lives, and the flashlight falls to the floor. LOW ANGLE FROM THE FLOOR - JUST BEHIND THE FLASHLIGHT We see the skewed horror: as the dog tears at Bill, as his gun skitters across the floor; as Patrick grabs the gun and fires, and we get a bit more illumination from the exploding gunpowder.  But it does no good. Bill screams in terror as he's torn to pieces, and then the flashlight goes out and again, we're in Stygian darkness. The sound of Bill dying and a long silence.}
<CHAR>__{PATRICK } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}

<ACTION>__{Pause -- the music from Bones' crib still beckons to them.}
<CHAR>__{PATRICK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.  Come on.  Don't let go.}
<ACTION>__{We're in near total darkness as they climb the stairs, maybe a bit of moonlight now coming in from the roofless third floor they're approaching.  All we can hear is their footsteps and their breathing as they walk the rest of the way up the stairs and emerge into: BONES' CRIB - THEIR POV Both amazed to see Pearl as young and beautiful as Cinnabar is, clinging to the dashing Jimmy dancing to the spectral sounds of some soul classic from back in the day.  Cinnabar entranced by the vision.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANGLE AS}
<ACTION>__{Pearl opens her dreaming eyes and sees them, smiling and beckoning Cinnabar to come join her.  Cinnabar begins to. Patrick watches her until he hears something O.S. calling to him.  It sounds a million miles away and yet right in his ear.  And it sounds like Jeremiah.}
<CHAR>__{JEREMIAH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Paaatrick...}
<ACTION>__{PATRICK'S POV He turns and looks at the wall -- subtly surging from beneath the surface of the wall he sees flashes of faces and hands, mouths twisted in torment.  He moves to the wall, drawn by the strange sight and the recurring sound...}

<DIAL>__{Dad?}

<CHAR>__{PATRICK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No!!!}
<ACTION>__{As Patrick struggles and writhes and twists to get free from his father's grasp, he can see back across the room to the others.  He sees the room as it really is - he can see what's really happening. Pearl, not in a new dress, but in a horrible tattered, blood encrusted old dress, standing next to a rotting cadaver that's stroking Cinnabar's cheek and holding her close... Jeremiah pulling Patrick into the wall, into the Necropolis itself.  Patrick, though, just as concerned with Cinnabar as with himself, yelling at her across the crib.}
<CHAR>__{PATRICK } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Cinnabar!  Stop!}
<ACTION>__{But Cinnabar doesn't even turn her head.  She just steps into her father's embrace.  But Pearl does seem to hear something. She looks back at Patrick, beneath the illusion of the room she sees him being pulled into the awful wall, and can hear him more clearly now.}
<CHAR>__{PATRICK } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{No!  Cinnabar, no!!!!}
<ACTION>__{Slowly, Pearl turns and looks into the mirror and she gets a full-length view of herself: a woman in ruined tatters of her old, rotted dress. Then, coming into her view in the mirror is her only daughter -- dancing with a decayed corpse.}

<DIAL>__{Noooooo!}
<ACTION>__{Pearl whirls and rips Cinnabar away from Bones, who at first sort of chuckles to himself.  But he stops laughing when Pearl grabs the nearest candle and presses the flame to her breast.  In a terrible whoosh, the dried old dress and Pearl are engulfed in flames.}

<DIAL>__{Get out!!!  Go!!!}
<ACTION>__{Cinnabar in a shattered daze on the floor, sees her mother in flames. Patrick desperately tries to escape his father's death grip. Finally, with horrible sound, Patrick wrestles free from the wall, and from his father. He lurches free from them and makes it over to Cinnabar and drags her out the door just as the room dissolves around them.  As the flames destroy the dress and the last vestiges of Bones' blood on it, the room begins to turn to ash. An eerie wind from nowhere begins to howl, blowing the ash and smoke from the dress and from the dissolving walls. Cinnabar taking one last glance at the funeral pyre that was her mother and Bones now, too, sees them almost lost in a shroud of flame and ash.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANGLE AS}
<ACTION>__{Patrick and Cinnabar run down the corridor and back down the stairs, the moon overhead and the flames from Bones crib giving everything a flickering hellish cat. Everything behind and above them crumbling to dust.  The floor and then the stairs and all the howling bodies trapped inside.}

<CHAR>__{PATRICK } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Cinnabar!  Where are you!?}

<DIAL>__{Let's go!!!}
<ACTION>__{They run out of the shaft and into the sub-basement just as the elevator and shaft dissolve into ash. A hurricane wind blowing down and out of the shaft now. Mixed with the sound of all the screaming, moaning souls in the Necropolis. Patrick in a fury to live tears away the boards and debris blocking the exit. He pulls Cinnabar out with him and they walk up the cellar stairs, step into the dawn, weary, beaten down but not dead.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BONES' BUILDING - DAY}
<ACTION>__{They've made it out of the Inferno.  Like Dante said "Thus we emerged again to see the stars."  No stars here, just the glorious dawn. Patrick stops, feels the new sun on his face.  Breathes clean air again for the first time.}

<DIAL>__{We made it...}
