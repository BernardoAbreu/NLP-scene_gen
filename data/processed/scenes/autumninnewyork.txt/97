<L>__{interior charlotte's bedroom continuous}
<A>__{charlotte enters wearily, drops her purse on the floor, then turns and gasps. wills lies sprawled in an armchair fully dressed, sound asleep. charlotte is offended by the intrusion. she hurries over to awaken him. but then she stops. her face softens slightly. she studies his face... touches his cheek with the back of her hand... traces the lines at his eyes with a fingertip.. smooths back a wisp of hair. finally, snapping to, steeling herself, she jostles him }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{wills wakes with a violent start. when he sees her, he drops his head back. he closes his eyes again and murmurs sleepily }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{where were you? i was worried.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{so worried you fell asleep. what're you doing here?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i've missed you. you have no idea how much.}
<A>__{she crosses coldly to her closet and, half shutting the door, blocking his view, starts to undress.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{how'd you get in?}
<A>__{he sits up, rubbing his eyes in the morning light.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{dolly. we watched tv. she fell asleep. what time is it?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i didn't know i had a curfew.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{where were you?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{none of your business. so what is it? what do you want?}
<A>__{wills sits forward, more alert now. he exhales heavily and begins:}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{to tell you that you were right. i do hate myself. but not so much that i can't see how stupid and despicable and }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{cowardly.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{and cowardly what i did was. and even though there's no excuse for it, i want you to forgive me.}
<A>__{she turns and looks at him. she feels herself relenting. she turns away and continues undressing }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{why should i?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{because, for better or worse, i'm falling in love with you, and the thought of our not being together is unbearable to me.}
<A>__{she stops, then glances at him with a flash of pain and longing. determined not to surrender to her feelings, she crosses to the bed and throws open the covers.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{let's sleep.}
<A>__{she crawls into bed.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{in the morning, we'll talk about what a gigantic asshole you are.}
<A>__{wills, relieved, crosses to the bed and begins to undress. he asks casually }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{so where were you?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{with shannon and simon and eric.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{who's eric?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{an old friend who used to work at blockbuster.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{what'd you guys do?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{talked and drank. simon and shannon finally went home. eric and i hung out.}
<A>__{thinking nothing of it, wills nods. he slips into bed. her back is to him. he drapes an arm around her and pulls her a little closer. he smiles contentedly and closes his eyes. but then something occurs to him. he opens his eyes }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{hung out where?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{stop. we'll talk about it tomorrow.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{he closes his eyes again. a few beats later, they open.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{talk about what? is there something to talk about? what happened?}
<A>__{charlotte, eyes still closed, breaks into a sly, amused smile.}
