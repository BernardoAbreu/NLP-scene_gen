<L>__{interior church upstairs}
<A>__{jack and michael are walking through the seemingly empty main hall of the church. looking for anyone who may be hanging out, ducking in and around. they spot a couple, making out in one of the pews. the man is shirtless, the woman in her bra. caught, they let out an embarrassed chuckle. with offense, but also humor:}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{in a house of god, no less? c'mon, get up...}
<A>__{the couple sheepishly exits the room, pulling on their clothes. as they do, they pass: bobby, burt, and joseph coming up the stairs. joseph pulls up the rear, standing behind his father. bobby sees jack and michael, now seated several rows back. beat, then:}
<C>__{michael solo }
<D>__{hello, bobby. nice suit you got on.}
<A>__{bobby gladly gives a nod of recognition, sits down in an empty front pew. burt brushes lint off his son's shoulder:}
<C>__{burt grusinsky}
<D>__{your hair's long.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{i know. i like it this way.}
<P>__{(no response, so:)}
<D>__{that why you got me up here? [to] tell me my hair's too long?}
<A>__{joseph speaks up, diverting bobby's attention:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{bobby, i asked pop to bring you here.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{whatsamatter?}
<A>__{joseph eyes his father with trepidation, then begins:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{well... i'm gonna be heading up a new narcotics team, starting this week. a russian unit, outta psa 2 in brighton.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<P>__{(lights a cigarette)}
<D>__{that's a good hook for you.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{yeah, they need me over there. there's only eleven guys in the whole department that even know the language right now, so...}
<A>__{bobby looks behind him. he's surrounded. interrogation style, his brother at the fore, bobby nonetheless remains calm, almost cheery. to jack, in the back:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{you ever talk?}
<C>__{jack shapiro}
<D>__{i'm old fashioned. i listen first.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{bobby, we need you to do us a favor.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<P>__{(smirking)}
<D>__{a favor? oh, he needs a favor!}
<P>__{(to burt, needling)}
<C>__{bobby green }
<D>__{you cut me off financially, and now you need the favor? `s interesting.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{pudge }
<A>__{jack steps forward, a photo in hand.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky }
<D>__{we're looking at this guy vadim nezhinski.}
<A>__{puts the photo in front of bobby. mug shot of an acne scarred, dark eyed man we've seen before: vadim nezhinski.}
<D>__{joseph grusinsky (o.c.) (cont'd) served time in the soviet union for black market activity, come over around 1979.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{`s good lookin' boy!}
<A>__{not amused, they withdraw the photo from in front of bobby.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{he's dealing h, cocaine, angel dust... operates out of that club you manage. the el caribe.}
<A>__{bobby's sense of humor disappears now.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{i don't know nothing about that.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{no, we know that. we checked up and down the rest of management, too his uncle, the owner }
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{the old man?! what, you been watching us?!?}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{everybody come up clean. it's just nezhinski we're lookin' at.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<P>__{(back to burt)}
<D>__{what the fuck is this?}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{we need to track how he's bringin' in the product and...we were just hopin' you'd keep your eyes and ears open a little.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{you kidding me? inform for you?!? that's what you wanted me here for?}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{no, we would never ask you to do that. just observe, that's all. it's a closed community and you're our only way in right now }
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{yeah well, find another way. i got a lot invested in that club and i can't let it get fucked up.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{nothing's gonna get fucked up, bobby. all it takes is one thing, you know that! one guy to flip, we crack the whole thing!}
<A>__{michael solo pipes up from the back:}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{bobby, it's important. these ain't dumb guys we're talking about. we don't stop `em up front, coupla years from now, it'll be chaos out there.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we'd be wishing the italians'd come back.}
<A>__{bobby is still focused on his brother, then to his father:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{[you] fuckin' broadsided me... everything's about the goddamned job with you.}
<A>__{burt remains stoic. (though silent so far, he should be a huge presence in the scene others look to him for reaction, approval, etc.) joseph sharpens:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{whole city's falling apart, bobby don't you got any sense of responsibility at all?}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{c'mon... get off your fuckin' high horse and bust somebody else's balls.}
<C>__{burt grusinsky}
<P>__{(finally, to joseph)}
<D>__{all right, go downstairs. lemme talk to him.}
<A>__{burt gestures to mike and jack, and they exit. joe doesn't respond at first. then, begrudgingly, to bobby:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{thanks for coming.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{just be careful out there next coupla weeks.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{'s that supposed to mean?!?}
<C>__{burt grusinsky}
<D>__{joseph!}
<A>__{joseph lingers, leaves. father and son. alone. then, staring straight ahead as he takes a drag of his cigarette:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{congratulations. you got me up here.}
<C>__{burt grusinsky}
<D>__{i knew you wouldn't help us. i told your brother, i said, `no point even bringing him down here.'}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{good. then now you know.}
<A>__{bobby starts to leave. burt grabs his arm:}
<C>__{burt grusinsky}
<D>__{hold on a second lemme ask you a question. that girl of yours downstairs she puerto rican?}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{yeah. i like the dark meat.}
<C>__{burt grusinsky}
<D>__{she hooking you up?}
<C>__{bobby green}
<P>__{(lets out a chuckle)}
<D>__{why, you want some?}
<C>__{burt grusinsky}
<D>__{yeah, keep laughing your mother, rest in peace, i think she was too easy on you.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{i gotta go, pop. i will see you `round.}
<A>__{bobby turns his back on burt, getting up to walk downstairs. burt remains emotional, reaching out to his son when bobby is not looking, lowering it to no avail.}
