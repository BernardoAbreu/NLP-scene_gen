<L>__{interior mustang night moving}
<A>__{will has one pizza left in the back of his car. he pulls over outside an office building.}
<L>__{interior law firm, office building night}
<A>__{rows of cubicles. speckled with late night stragglers, bleary eyes, too busy generating detailed lists of places they'd rather be to notice the pizza boy walking along. will stops before one such work station, looks on for a beat.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{rio?}
<A>__{kate (25) turns from the glow of her computer screen. she has short, messy hair and a sarcastic smile. this is the girl from the picture in will's apartment.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{that's the plan. five days, six nights. culture. beaches. acceptable probability of kidnapping. i leave in the morning.}
<A>__{kate looks back at her computer, logged onto an expedia checkout page for a rio vacation. she moves the mouse pointer from the "proceed" key...closes the window.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{this morning i loaded up an african safari and a cruise to alaska.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{oh, the places you'll go.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{fuck expedia. travel advisor. making it seem so easy.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it is. just do it. get away for a while.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{even if i could afford that...they fired two other paralegals last week. now's not the time to be putting in for vacation days.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{ok. done. i've got my dose of the actual working world. can we eat?}
<A>__{will lays a pizza down on her desk.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{how do you keep sneaking up here past the security guard?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{he's there like half the time. the other half i smile at him. i'm relatively certain he's a homosexual.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{interesting theory...}
<A>__{kate opens the pizza box, grabs a slice.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{maybe i should set him up with tom small. he came out to me today on facebook.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that kid beat the hell out of me and chet in grammar school. wow.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{tell me about it. he fingered me at junior prom while they were playing "no scrubs."}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(winces)}
<D>__{really? what a fucking scrub.}
<A>__{will grabs a slice. they eat quietly for a beat.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{so, i've got some news...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i thought the tom small stuff was enough of a headline, but go ahead.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm getting back together with mark.}
<A>__{will's delicious pizza suddenly tastes like shit. he does his best to swallow it down.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{but you...you broke up with him...ended the relationship. finality was had.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{yeah, but we were talking and }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{forget it. i don't want to know.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you sound like chet.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{woah, don't compare me to your brother.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{well, neither one of you seems to care that i don't have a life. mark's not perfect...but a relationship is better than working late every friday because i have nowhere else to be.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{sure. i get it. here we are. friday night. nowhere to be.}
<A>__{kate shoves will, good naturedly.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<A>__{will shrugs, quietly devastated. goes back to his pizza.}
