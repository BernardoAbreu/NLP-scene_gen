<L>__{exterior l.a. streets evening}
<A>__{john walks the streets, numb to the world. a rat scurries past near the curb. then another. several crows fly by. above him is a billboard "your time is running out." doesn't matter that below it is "to buy a new chevy." the point is crystal clear. john shakes his head, breaks out laughing which quickly turns into a coughing fit. he leans to a gutter. another rat scoots past. john barely notices. then a frog jumps past. but it's the crab crawling by that finally catches john's gaze.}
<C>__{voice of man }
<D>__{hey, buddy, you got a light?}
<A>__{john turns, settles on a silhouetted figure standing behind him, unlit cigarette butt in its mouth.}
<C>__{old man}
<P>__{(coughs)}
<D>__{we gotta stick together, right?}
<A>__{john gathers himself. as he walks over to this old man, he rummages through his coat pocket, retrieves a matchbox. the box shudders as a high pitch fluttering filters from inside. old man winces as his entire body vibrates. john realizes this is beeman's matchbox, the one with the screech beetle inside. and now he knows a beat too late. old man attacks. john is knocked onto his haunches. as the old man closes in, he's revealed in more detail. body and face are actually an intricate puzzle, an assemblage of city vermin. rats, insects, crows, frogs, crabs all held together in the shape of a man. john scampers backwards, just inches from this being's outstretched grasp. he shakes the matchbox and the screech beetle inside flutters again. old man demon cringes as his entire body vibrates apart for a second, then snaps back together. he grabs onto john with fingers of squirming vermin. snake wraps around his wrist. crab snaps at his skin. john shakes the beetle box harder causing the parts to vibrate even further. old man grabs john's head and vermin of various leg count crawl right onto john's face. john's had enough shakes the matchbox violently, then smashes it against the sidewalk. beetle lets out a death shriek and the old man stutters his parts vibrating so wildly you can actually see the b.g. through the seams. john scampers loose, grabs a road barricade and swings it with all his might. old man form shatters on impact. the entire mess collapses to the ground in a flood of scattering critters. john starts stomping on them as they scatter into the city. john stands there, shocked and concerned. what the hell is going on?}
