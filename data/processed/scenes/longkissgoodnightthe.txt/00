<B>__{a windowpane}
<A>__{assaulted from without by snowflakes. wind tossed. inside, a bed, dappled with moon shadow. a little girl, fast asleep. the wind whistles and sighs outside. she dreams... eyelids closed, eyes roving beneath... then suddenly they snap open. a stifled cry. she thrashes for her stuffed bear, as a soft voice says:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{shhhhh.}
<A>__{and there's mom, kneeling beside her. vague shape in the dimness. the full moon throws light across one sparkling eye.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{mommy, the men on the mountain...!}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{shhhh. gone, all gone now.}
<P>__{(strokes her hair)}
<D>__{i'm here. mommy's always here and no one can ever hurt you. safe now... safe and warm... snug as a bug in a rug.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will sit with you, think you can sleep?}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{turn on the nightlight.}
<A>__{the mother nods. passes her left hand gently over the girl's forehead.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{close your eyes now. i love you.}
<A>__{the child subsides, breathing steady. eyes closed. the mother rises. regards her through the dimness. slowly turns, heads for the door. flicks on a winnie the pooh nightlight her entire right forearm is slicked with blood. more blood on her czech made mp 5 machine gun. she staggers just a little... barely noticeable. passes out on the light. into darkness. sits beside her daughter's bed. the child sleeps peacefully. outside snow slithers at the glass.}
