<A>__{rob mounts the stairs and rings the doorbell. the door opens, revealing a too tan woman in her late forties, in designer jeans and a t shirt bearing a rhinestone peace sign. she says nothing.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{hi. you called about the records?}
<A>__{she turns and walks into the house, leaving the door open for him. he follows her in and through a fabulous first floor, packed with big bucks bourgeois: rugs, art, and antiques: she ushers rob into a large study, and turns the light on. he misses a breath. the walls are lined with mahogany cases custom built for cds, albums, epicurean stereo components, a couple priceless vintage guitars every one of the thousands of items bear a little numbered sticker, like a museum. she points to several boxes on the floor, full of hundreds of singles.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{those.}
<A>__{rob steps into the room like an undeserving, and carefully drops to his knees to examine the singles, each pristine in a plastic sleeve: the original god save the queen by the sex pistols, original otis reddings, elvis presleys, james browns, jerry lee lewises, beatles... on and on. the mother lode. rob is doing the best to control the onset of hyperventilation. he dares a glance over his shoulder to her to see if this is a joke.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it's the best collection i've ever seen.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.}
<A>__{rob's face goes funny. he looks around for a hidden camera.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{these are worth at least, i don't know }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i know what they're worth. give me fifty and get them out.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{but you must have }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i must have nothing. their my husband's.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{and you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{he's in jamaica with a twenty three year old. a friend of my daughter's. he had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and i told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever i go, minus a ten percent commission. which reminds me. can you make sure you give me a five? i want to frame it and put it on the wall.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it must have taken him a long time to get them together.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{years. this collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.}
<A>__{rob looks back at the records but avoids the trance.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{look. can i pay you properly? you don't have to tell him what you got. send him forty five bucks and blow the rest. give it to charity. or something.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{that wasn't part of the deal. i want to be poisonous but fair.}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(looking back at the records)}
<D>__{look... i... i'm sorry. i don't want to be any part of this.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{suit yourself. there are plenty of others who will.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{that's why i'm trying to compromise. what about fifteen hundred? they're worth five times that.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{sixty.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{thirteen hundred.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{seventy five.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{eleven hundred. that's my lowest offer.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{and i won't take a penny over ninety.}
<A>__{they start smiling at each other.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{with eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing i want.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i'm sorry but i think you better talk to someone else.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{rob half stands, then drops again for one last lingering look.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{can i buy this otis redding single off you?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{sure. ten cents.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh, come on! let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all i care.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{okay. because you took the trouble to come up here. and because you've got principles. but that's it. i'm not selling them to you one by one.}
