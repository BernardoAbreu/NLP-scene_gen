<A>__{peeking out from behind the pillar on the south bound platform. parker's pov across the tracks passengers rush in every direction. some are screaming. some are crying. nobody knows who fired the shot. or where to go. but everyone is going somewhere. including sid 6.7, who makes his way through the flurry of movement toward the up escalator. it is difficult to keep sight of him.}

<A>__{the rest of the passengers hit the deck, except for a college student listening to music on headphones. he is riding the escalator up. sid 6.7 stands behind him, using the student as a shield. parker' s pov as sid 6.7 ascends, slight portions of his body are momentarily exposed behind the student as he sways with the music coming from his headphones. parker does not have a clean shot. in 10 seconds, sid 6.7 will disappear from view completely and parker will have no shot at all. a momentary sliver of sid 6.7 becomes visible. an inch and a half at most.}
<B>__{parker}
<A>__{doesn't hesitate. he lines up his shot and pulls the trigger. on the north bound up escalator the college student standing in front of sid 6.7 gets winged in the shoulder. not a serious wound, but a painful one just the same. the bullet must have hit bone, because it deflected upon impact, missing sid 6.7 entirely. the student drops to the escalator, screaming in pain. sid}
