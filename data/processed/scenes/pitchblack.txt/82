<L>__{exterior grave site spired hills day}
<A>__{fry and johns stand over the grave. it's a gory mess but no sign of zeke. johns has riddick's confiscated shiv.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{he used that?}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{sir shiv a lot. he likes to cut.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{so why isn't it all bloody?}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{i assume he licked it clean.}
<L>__{interior main cabin crash ship day}
<A>__{riddick is back in chains, face pulpy from the beating, listening to sotto voce voices outside. fry enters, looks at him hard.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{so where is he?}
<A>__{riddick turns away, revealing a broken goggle lens. the eye beneath is closed: for some reason, he won't look at her.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{tell me about the sounds. you told them you heard something right before....}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{if you don't talk to me, johns'll take another crack at it at your skull.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{'mean the whispers?}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{what whispers?}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{the ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. the abdominal aorta. what a gusher. had a cup on his belt, so i used it to catch a little run off. metallic taste to it, human blood. coppery. but if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. course, that's more for winter. summertime, i take mine straight.}
<A>__{fry stares. riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as boogeyman: if fear is the only kind of respect he can get, riddick is going to grab some with both hands.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{why don't we try the truth now?}
<A>__{a head shaking beat, then:}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{all you people are so scared of me an' most days, i'd take that as a compliment but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{show me your eyes.}
<A>__{again he turns away. she strips the goggles off. he sits with lids shut tight, anticipating the pain.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{show me , riddick.}
<A>__{imagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first time. that's how riddick opens his eyes, startling us: no irises, just huge black pool pupils. and from deep within, a jewel like eyeshine. his eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as those of a starved jaguar.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{you did this? to yourself?}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{slam doctor. well, we called him "doctor."}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{heard about it. just never seen it.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up then you wind up here. three ass kick suns.}
<P>__{(replacing goggles)}
<D>__{maybe i did do a few people. but not this one. no ma'am, not this time.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{then where is he? he's not in the hole. we looked.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{look deeper.}
<A>__{he clicks his tongue at her.}
