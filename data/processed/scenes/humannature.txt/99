<L>__{interior electrologist's office day}
<A>__{rose is doing lila's feet.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{my brother says things are going really well between you and nathan.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i cannot believe how in love i am with this man.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{he's so cute. i even like his cute little penis. it's like a little pig's penis or something.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{rose, we connect on every level. i've finally found someone i can feel completely safe with.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{don't throw that away. i had that once with a guy. but i threw it away for a cheap thrill.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{one night stand?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{no. i married a midget.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{well he wasn't really a midget. he was on the cusp of midgethood. that's what made it cheap. had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i didn't know you were into that sort of thing.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. they're portable. they're controllable. they're eager. and they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(screams with delight, then:)}
<D>__{i have a friend you might like to meet.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{three foot one.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{be still my crotch.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{rose, nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{yeah. my brother told me.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{and i think i'm going to.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(mulling it over)}
<D>__{stand on a stepladder sometimes.}
