<A>__{rainey stands over chris as chris does sit ups. rainey's gut hanging a little heavy over his belt. os voices exchange christmas greetings.}
<C>__{rainey}
<D>__{i really ought to get myself doing that.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you should rainey. makes that tantric stuff go even better.}
<C>__{rainey}
<D>__{how the hell would you know? that poor girl over there is about ready to vault onto a fence post. and here you are, the monk of jack lalane.}
<A>__{they share a laugh. chris comes to the end of his sit ups. wipes his brow with a towel. rainey squats down next to him.}
<C>__{rainey }
<D>__{i guess jan filled you in. about reno and everything. children can be harsh judges when it comes to their parents. they don't grant clemency easily. i think reno tended to see things in black and white. i just hope he lives long enough to forgive her.}
<A>__{the connection is not lost on chris.}
<C>__{rainey }
<D>__{but painful as it is, you turned a light on in her and i'm grateful.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{me too.}
<C>__{rainey}
<D>__{for what?}
<A>__{chris doesn't answer. a kid rides by on a bright new big wheel. must be from the rich side of the commune.}
<C>__{rainey }
<D>__{do your folks know where you are?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{rainey}
<D>__{don't you think they ought to?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{they should. but i can't. not yet, anyway. i got a sister though, carine. she's the most beautiful girl in the world. but, it's all got to stay behind me until i get where i'm going.}
<C>__{rainey}
<D>__{alaska?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{yeah, rainey. alaska.}
<A>__{rainey won't intrude any further. he just nods. chris notices tracy in the door of her parent's rig, stealthily waving him over. chris gives rainey the "uh oh" look, pulls on his t shirt, and walks over to the rig. tracy has disappeared inside.}
