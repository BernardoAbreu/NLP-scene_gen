<L>__{interior downtown headquarters day}
<A>__{phones ringing, typewriters typing, bodies moving at cross current camera finding lieutenant garber, hustling through the bullpen, mike following, toward his office.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{i don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{i just sat and listened.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{safe and secure is how we want her. until she i.d.'s venza.}
<A>__{t.j. has joined them.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{venza's either going to skip or try to get to her and venza likes it here. i want her ass covered, 24 hour protection, but i don't want her to know there is any real danger.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{i don't like what i'm hearing...}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(to garber)}
<D>__{i don't understand. if there's any danger, why not just level with her...}
<A>__{garber turns back to mike}
<C>__{garber}
<P>__{(with mock tolerance)}
<D>__{t.j. your friend's a little dense. when she realizes there's a killer tryin' to shut her up, she'll be on the next plane for tahiti... somehow i think my way is better.}
<A>__{he moves on, leaving them not very happy.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{chief?}
<A>__{garber turns back.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{why not patrol? they'd do just as good a job.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{when i want your advise, keegan, i will make an appointment.}
<A>__{garber moves on out. mike and t.j. left alone.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{shit! a nursemaid! my first detail, and i'm a fuckin' slug!}
<P>__{(turning to t.j.)}
<D>__{i got a 'choice' at all.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{do it, or look for another profession. that's a choice i guess.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you in this with me?}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{yeah! seniority gets the day shift.}
