<L>__{interior elevator continuous}
<A>__{bones' pov rises straight up as if still in a working elevator. it rises and we follow up from the basement to the empty first floor, past the second floor to:}
<B>__{the third floor}
<A>__{where we're still inside, floating in the elevator cage. then the pov moves through the metal bars and floats towards bill, who's approaching the door of the room where jimmy died. as bill reaches to open it, bones' pov floats closer and closer right up on bill's back now. bill feeling the hairs on his neck suddenly rising. then he hears:}
<C>__{hollow echoes}
<D>__{go on. it won't kill you.}
<A>__{bill turns around to check with maurice.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you had to hear tha...}
<A>__{but maurice is gone. and he doesn't see the shadow there behind him. bill leans in to the door, listening...}
<C>__{hollow echoes}
<D>__{i ain't gonna be the only one with this nigger's blood on my hands...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what the f ?}
<A>__{a hand jolts him from behind. he spins it's just maurice.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{'s up?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{nothing. contact paranoia. must be buggin' from hanging with you.}
<A>__{they turn to walk back down. maurice stops to re light his joint when the bones shadow reaches out to grab his wrist. but it's no good. the shadow hand passes right through, maurice pauses for an instant as if he felt something. maurice lights his roach, and the match burns closer and closer to his fingertips. then singes them and he drops the match. maurice then heads downstairs after bill. the shadow remains behind, staring at the still burning match on the wooden floor. he bends down, staring intently as if willing it to burn, his hands urging it on, the flame suddenly rising. but then the match sputters harmlessly out. the shadow turns back towards the boys downstairs.}
<B>__{while on the second floor}
<A>__{tia explores the rest of the floor. hears a sound, like a whimpering, from behind another door. she slowly eases open the door then jumps back inside, the dog. it growls low and mean, the black fur on the back of it's neck rising. it's eyes burning too red and bright. tia freezes. the dog growls deeply at her. and as he does we see the bones shadow rising behind her. it seems to lean in and over her, and the dog stops growling. tia cautiously holds her hand outstretched with the burger for the dog to smell. bones' shadow from lingers behind her, perhaps simply enjoying the first sight in hellish eons of a beautiful girl.}
<C>__{tia}
<D>__{how'd you get locked in here? and for how long? poor baby...}
<A>__{the dog leaps up but not to rip her throat out. instead it snatches the burger and wolfs it down in one gulp.}
<C>__{tia }
<D>__{poor boy. you must be starving.}
