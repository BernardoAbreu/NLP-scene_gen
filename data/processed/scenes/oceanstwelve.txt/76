<L>__{interior vanderspeigle office night}
<A>__{they enter vanderspeigle's office. you can hear him snoring in the other room. danny and rusty quickly, carefully remove the crossbow bolt from the wall and take it to the window. they drop it (and the attached wires) to the malloys, who are waiting on the street below. meanwhile linus spackles the hole in the wall and paints over the spackle. danny and rusty turn to see that linus is finished. they hand signal each other like special forces guys do, then move towards the bookcase on the adjacent wall.}
<C>__{isabel }
<D>__{that must have really been something.}
<A>__{suddenly:}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{wait! wait! shhhh!}
<A>__{everyone freezes. danny puts his hand up to his ear to try to listen for the sound he thought he heard. we hear the faint sound of somebody singing to themselves. danny and rusty quickly realize it's coming from behind the bookcase. what the hell? they yank open the false bookcase to reveal a handsome frenchman who has just finished cleaning out the contents of vanderspeigle's safe. danny and rusty stare at him. he turns around and sees them, but if he's bothered in the slightest he sure isn't showing it. danny approaches him. this exchange is whispered with a great amount of drama at very close range.}

<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{we don't.}
<C>__{dinner jacket}

<A>__{yen says something in chinese.}
<C>__{dinner jacket}
<D>__{there's really no need for that.}
<A>__{danny wants to raise his voice, but he can't. vanderspeigle is snoring twenty feet away.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{listen, we have to come to some arrangement.}
<C>__{linus}

<A>__{he sounds as angry as a guy who's whispering can sound.}
<C>__{livingston}
<D>__{if the situation were reversed }
<C>__{dinner jacket}
<D>__{but the situation is not reversed. the situation is that i am here first, without any help from you.}

<A>__{he hands danny a business card.}
<C>__{dinner jacket}
<D>__{my attorney. in case evelyn's employer tries anything...well, anything.}
<A>__{dinner jacket smiles, then pulls a tiny electronic device out of his shirt pocket. he presses a button. and the alarm blares to life. back to scene the crime scene paul stares at isabel.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{i'm sure there's another scenario that would fit these physical details, but i don't know what it is.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{where should we start?}
<A>__{isabel takes out her pda, writes something on her keypad, and hits a few buttons. a second later, paul's beeper goes off.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{you can start by picking that guy up.}
