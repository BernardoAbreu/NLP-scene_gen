<A>__{the arrivals gate slides open and passengers flood through. john stands among the chauffeurs and cab drivers, as the passengers trundle by. we follow one young woman long enough to think this must be her, but it's a false alarm, she's lifted up and spun around by someone else. they've all passed. that's that. she wasn't on the flight. john wanders away from the gate. he stands about in the swirl in the middle of the airport. people bustle by. everyone going somewhere. gradually, we get the sense we are being watched. a woman stands nearby. she is about twenty, very beautiful, tired and laden with luggage.}
