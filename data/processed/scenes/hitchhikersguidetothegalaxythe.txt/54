<A>__{we hover above a greenish purplish planet. improbability effect space ripples. something begins to materialize, something big and gray tumbling toward us. we now see the big, gray thing is a giant rhinoceros which ripples, flips inside out and becomes the heart of gold.}
<L>__{interior heart of gold. bridge night}
<A>__{a knitted version of arthur, trillian, ford and zaphod sit in chairs before the ships console.}
<C>__{knitted zaphod}
<P>__{(clutching stomach)}
<D>__{is this going to happen every time we hit that button?}
<C>__{knitted trillian}
<D>__{very probably, yes.}
<A>__{the air ripples. the 'knitted' crew flip back to their former selves. arthur pukes into a trash bin and with a sick expression, looks up to the screen.}

<C>__{zaphod head 2}
<D>__{yeah, as if, apeman.}
<A>__{arthur suddenly feels something on his back, leaps out of the chair and brushes it off. the two mice land on the floor across the ship, then scurry away down a hallway. before arthur can react...}
<C>__{eddie}
