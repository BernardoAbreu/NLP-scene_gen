<A>__{yevhen's ukrainian cousin, mashkov, stares down at the corpse. steve is long gone. mashkov kneels down by the body and starts sobbing.}
<L>__{interior house night}
<A>__{mashkov walks through a living room, past some lighting equipment and a video camera and we get just enough of a look to realize that a porno is being shot here but he couldn't care less as he makes his way into the kitchen where his boss, danya, 60, the owner of this house, is eating a bowl of frosted flakes at the kitchen table. they speak in a colloquial ukrainian tongue that we subtitle.}

<D>__{by who?}

<D>__{that's what i'm going to find out.}
<A>__{they stop talking for a moment as one of the "actresses" comes in, plops herself down next to danya and pours herself a bowl of cereal. she puts her hand on danya's leg. she's young and it's a disturbing image and we recognize her: she's the hitchhiker who lyle passed in the taxi ride down figueroa street when he first arrived in l.a. danya goes back to speaking subtitled ukrainian.}
