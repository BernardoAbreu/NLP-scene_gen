<D>__{... in light of the report i've got before me; in light of the narrative i'm now hearing...}
<L>__{interior fbi office of professional review day}
<A>__{jana cassidy sits at the head of the desk, just as when we first met her. she is flanked by the other members of the review board, including a.d. skinner who sits at the end of the table. cassidy flips through a file she's referred to before she continues. looking up with consternation as she resumes.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{... my official report is incomplete pending these new facts i'm being asked to reconcile. agent scully...}
<B>__{agent scully}
<A>__{sitting where she last sat, at the small table. the seat next to her conspicuously empty. her face bears the signs of slight frostbite, somewhat healed. her expression is even, her attitude composed, but her eyes are filled of dark, restrained defiance.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{...while there is direct evidence now that a federal agent may have been involved in the bombing... the other events you've laid down here seem too incredible on their own, and quite frankly implausible in their connection.}
<A>__{panning the other board members curious, bemused like cassidy. skinner shifts uncomfortably.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{what is it you find incredible?}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{well...where would you like me to start? antarctica is a long way from dallas, agent scully. i can't very well submit a report to the attorney general that alleges the links you've made here. bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.}

<D>__{no, they don't.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{most of what i find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. i realize you're very lucky to be alive agent scully. the ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the justice department. until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.}
<A>__{scully has her hand in her coat pocket now. moving around the table and approaching cassidy. removing something which she puts on the desk in front of her. a small vial.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i don't believe the fbi currently has an investigation unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand.}
<A>__{cassidy picks up the vial, studying the contents of this vial: the dead bee that stung scully. studying it as scully turns and moves to the door, without permission, no further adieu.}
<B>__{angle to include a.d. skinner}
<A>__{watching scully exit.}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{mr. skinner....?}
