<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{out on the deck, sandro, patrizia, raimondo and giulia are looking over the side of the boat, watching the sailor as he approaches the yacht with a rubberized raft. giulia, with her usual air of affectation, looks down at the water splashing up against the raft and asks the sailor:}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{but aren't you afraid?}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{ma'am, sharks never attack anybody. anyway, the raft is dark, and they wouldn't be able to see it.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{so, it is true that they're blind...}
<A>__{anna appears at the door of the cabin and sandro rushes over to meet her, a little surprised to find her looking so cheerful, as though the incident that had just taken place were completely forgotten.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{how are you?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{fine. can't you see so yourself?}
<A>__{anna goes over to the edge of the boat and stands at the head of the little stairway leading down to the water.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i have an urge to put my feet on some land. aren't you coming?}
<A>__{as she starts to go down the steps, sandro quickly comes over to her.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{anna... maybe it would be better to wait a while.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{wait for what?}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{well, with a shark running loose around the place, i for one won't get aboard that raft! they'll have to catch it first. i want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{better dead.}
<A>__{but anna has already stepped aboard the raft, and sandro follows her. giulia has her eyes fixed on the beach where corrado in his white suit is waiting for them. her desire to join him is greater than her fear of the shark, so she looks down at the sailor and asks:}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{will the three of us fit?}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{sure, sure. there's plenty of room.}
<A>__{patrizia, instead, turns around and heads back to the cabin. and raimondo follows her shortly after. giulia descends into the raft and, as it moves away from the boat with a slight pitch, she lets out a few hysterical shrieks. anna laughs and then shouts out to claudia:}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{claudia, aren't you coming?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'm certainly not going to swim across.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{we'll send the raft back to you.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{and bring some cushions when you come, and a towel...}
<A>__{claudia nods assent, and remains there looking over the side and watching the water splash against the boat. suddenly, she looks up at the sky and realizes that the sun has disappeared. actually, it is hidden behind a cloud, and over on the horizon a group of other clouds have accumulated. the sailor left aboard the yacht is now signaling the other sailor on the raft who, having deposited sandro, anna and giulia on the beach, is returning to pick up claudia. he sounds the depths with his oar and then shouts up:}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{okay. come ahead, come ahead.}
<A>__{the sailor aboard the yacht goes over to claudia and says:}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{i'm taking the boat right up to the shore, and we'll let you get off from the gangplank as soon as we get there.}
<A>__{then he disappears inside and soon the yacht starts moving towards the shore. claudia peers out over the landscape; the islands are sharply silhouetted against the sea and sky, the volcano on stromboli smokes feebly, and in the distance a ship passes by. claudia is plainly enchanted by the view. then she collects her thoughts and slowly heads towards the cabin.}
