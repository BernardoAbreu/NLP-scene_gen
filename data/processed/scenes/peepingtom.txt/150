<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior stage e. day}
<A>__{the (studio) camera is ready for a tracking shot. the set is redressed as the hat department of the store. the inspector stands on the dolly, looking round with interest. the doctor is sitting in a chair watching everything like an excited schoolboy. the sergeant has positioned himself near the sound crew. baden walks on to the set, his arm round diane's shoulder. he is talking to her softly. she keeps her eyes on the floor; he leads her to the front of the studio camera.}
<C>__{baden}
<D>__{try it, darling... we'll all be with you.}
<A>__{he pats her arm reassuringly. the chief cameraman nods to mark. from the inspector's pov we see mark pull a tape measure from the front of the camera and hold it to diane's forehead. from mark's pov we see the inspector watching him over the top of the studio camera. a man with a shock of white hair is also watching him... and the sergeant stares at him from the other side of the set. the tape measure in mark's hand remains steady. from the inspector's pov we see mark replace the tape measure and take up his position on a small stool by the side of the camera.}
<C>__{assistant director}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{quiet, everyone. let's run it!}
<A>__{the doctor sneezes violently and all heads turn towards him.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{terribly sorry.}
<A>__{in the nervous laughter that follows, the assistant cameraman whispers to the chief cameraman.}
<C>__{assistant cameraman}
<D>__{that sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist!... heard it on the grapevine.}
<A>__{close shot of mark turning round to look at the doctor a hint of hope in his face. close shot of the inspector following mark's glance.}
<C>__{assistant director}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{all right, everyone let's run it...}
<A>__{over the inspector's shoulder we track towards the rehearsal. we see mark swing out into space on his stool, turning the handle of the focus puller. diane approaches the hat counter. the assistant smiles at her.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i'd like to see... that one...}
<A>__{the assistant hands her a hat. diane tries it on.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{... have you it... in red...?}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{certainly, madam.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{... in... red}
<P>__{(suddenly she covers}
<D>__{her face in her}
<P>__{hands')}
<D>__{i can't! i can't, arthur!}
<A>__{she bursts into tears and runs off the set. from the inspector's pov we see baden whisper to the assistant director then hurry after diane.}
<C>__{assistant director}
<D>__{ten minutes break, everyone!}
<A>__{the unit dissolves into small, chattering groups. the assistant director hurries up to the doctor.}
<C>__{assistant director}
<D>__{can you suggest anything, doctor?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{no. it looked jolly interesting to me.}
<C>__{assistant director}
<D>__{i mean to help her psychologically...}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{yes. give the girl a proper rest... ten minutes is useless!}
<C>__{assistant director}
<P>__{(hastily)}
<D>__{thank you, doctor.}
<A>__{he bustles off and the doctor is left alone. he glances round thoughtfully. from the doctor's pov we see the small, chattering groups. then we see mark standing a few yards away, watching him. the doctor smiles at him pleasantly.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{what's your job?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm a focus puller...}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{oh... so am i, in a way.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i was wondering if you knew my father professor lewis...}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{professor... but of course i knew him. he lectured to me.}
<A>__{he looks at mark with renewed interest. so does the inspector. from his pov we see mark and the doctor talking. the doctor is fidgeting with his watch chain. mark fidgets with his jacket button. the inspector then glances towards the hat salesman, who is holding court in the comer. we return to mark and the doctor.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{he was an extraordinary man quite brilliant!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you know what he was interested in before he died?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{no? tell me...}
<A>__{mark puts his hands behind his back.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't remember what he called it... it was something to do with what causes people to be... peeping toms...}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{scoptophilia!... that would interest him! a most fertile mind.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{scopto...?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{philia... the morbid urge to gaze... coined since his day... have you any manuscripts of his which i could...?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{he thought... it could be cured...}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{usually. now about his manuscripts }
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{quickly?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{the cure? very quick... a couple of years analysis three times a week an hour a time and it's soon up rooted...}
<A>__{close shot of mark his last hope gone.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{... if you've any of his papers on the subject?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes, doctor...}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i'd like to see them i will give you my address, young man.}
<A>__{from the sergeant's pov we see the doctor hand mark a card, and pat him jovially on the shoulder. the sergeant edges up to the inspector.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{wonder what all that's about?}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{we'll find out afterwards... now, listen... i want you to watch who brings their own lunches... someone ate homemade cakes and sandwiches by the side of those bushes and we may get a lead.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{right, sir.}
<A>__{camera pans to a shelf in the comer. a lunch basket stands next to a cine camera.}
