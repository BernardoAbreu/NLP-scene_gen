<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{inside the cabin, which is partitioned into separate rooms, the general layout is neat and orderly, with a number of prints decorating the walls. sandro and anna, followed by claudia, enter from the outside deck and cross over into anna's room. it is extremely small, with two cots on one side and a long curtain that partially conceals a bureau from which several dresses are seen hanging. anna is soaking wet in her bathing suit and her hair is all knotted into clusters that hang down over her face. without bothering to dry herself, she crouches down on the cot and, assisted by claudia, wraps a blanket around her body. sandro and claudia look at her with great concern. a member of the crew enters carrying a tray on which there is a half filled glass of liquor, which sandro takes and offers to anna.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{here, drink some cognac.}
<A>__{anna positively refuses it, and the sailor leaves as sandro sets the glass down on a shelf. looking up at both sandro and claudia, anna appears pleased with their solicitude.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's nothing... really. let's go back... it's all over now.}
<A>__{a pause and then an instant later, she begins shivering under the blanket.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{only, i'd like to change. i'm a little cold.}
<A>__{leaving anna and claudia alone on their own, sandro turns and goes outside the cabin where the others are still congregated, busy chattering. among the remarks exchanged, one that is distinctly heard is patrizia's.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{but where did the shark go to?}
<A>__{as soon as sandro closes the door to the cabin, anna is suddenly and completely changed. she gets up from the cot, goes over to the curtain and draws it aside, revealing an array of feminine attire. wondering which dress to choose, she finally selects two and tosses them on the cot.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{which one shall i wear?}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(picking up one of the two dresses)}
<D>__{this one is gorgeous.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{then why don't you try it on?}
<A>__{as anna begins to dry herself with a large bath towel, claudia slips on the dress and looks at herself in the mirror with a coquettish expression on her face.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it looks better on you than it does on me... you keep it.}
<A>__{anna is removing her bathing suit as she continues talking to claudia with a tone and manner that reveal a sense of excitement mixed with one of amusement.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you know, that thing about the shark was all a joke.}
<A>__{claudia looks at her as though dumbfounded, as though she had never known her before. she is obviously piqued and angry, but more with herself than with anna.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{there's the difference between you and me: you know how to put over certain things, and i don't. sometimes i envy you.}
<A>__{anna is all dressed and ready. she opens the door and steps outside, as claudia follows behind.}
