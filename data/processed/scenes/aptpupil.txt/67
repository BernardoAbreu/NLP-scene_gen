<L>__{exterior residential neighborhood various streets night}
<A>__{todd's driving reflects his state of mind: erratic and out of control. he meets a police car at an intersection and almost runs a red light. the police car doesn't bother him, however, and a moment later he pulls the honda up to dussander's house.}
<L>__{interior dussander's kitchen night}
<A>__{todd appears in the door of the kitchen. his face tells us that what he sees is ten times worse than whatever he expected. the room is a gruesome sight. blood and broken glass are everywhere. the table has been knocked to the side. dussander, barely conscious, slumps in a chair.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what the fuck...?}
<A>__{todd moves to the center of the room, careful not to step in any blood. he doesn't know what to do. his attention falls on dussander. suddenly he rushes to him and begins to inspect his body carefully.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{where are you bleeding?... wake up.}
<A>__{dussander does not respond. todd shakes him harder.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{wake up, goddamnit!}
<A>__{dussander stirs a little, aggravated.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{i thought you said you had a fucking heart attack.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{it's not my blood, for christ's sake.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{it was self defense, boy. go downstairs. you'll see what needs to be done.}
<A>__{dussander points to the open cellar door.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{fuck you. i'm not going down there. what happened? what did you do?}
<A>__{dussander only stares back at him, then looks away, almost smiling through his incredible pain, as if to challenge todd.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{what the hell is this?}
<A>__{dussander does not respond. todd stares at him for a moment, then moves toward the cellar.}
