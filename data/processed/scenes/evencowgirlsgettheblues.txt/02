<A>__{we see candles burning on a cake. it is somebody's birthday. and there are six candles on the cake. sissy hankshaw is six years old. her daddy and a visiting uncle, finishing their rendition of happy birthday, are staring down at sissy and looking at her young thumbs, which are unusually large and twitch with a mind of their own. she manages to blow out all six candles.}
<C>__{uncle}
<D>__{well, you're lucky that you don't suck 'em.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{sissy couldn't suck 'em, she'd need a mouth like a fish tank.}
<A>__{sissy is negotiating a fork full of birthday cake, dropping it because of her thumbs.}
<C>__{uncle}
<P>__{(agrees)}
<D>__{the poor little tyke might have a hard time finding herself a hubby. but as far as getting along in the world, it's a real blessing that sissy's a girl child. lord, i reckon this youngun would never make a mechanic.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{nope, and not a brain surgeon, neither.}
<C>__{uncle}
<D>__{course she'd do pretty good as a butcher. she could retire in two years on the overcharges alone.}
<A>__{laughing, the men walk to the kitchen to fill their glasses. sissy is left to feel sorry for herself in front of her cake.}
<C>__{uncle }
<D>__{one thing, that youngun would make one hell of a hitchhiker...}
<A>__{this startles sissy. a new word that tinkles in her head with a supernatural echo. sissy looks at her thumbs.}
<C>__{uncle }
<D>__{...if she was a boy, i mean.}
