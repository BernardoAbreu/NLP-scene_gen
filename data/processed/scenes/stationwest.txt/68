<L>__{exterior warehouse day}
<A>__{it is big, barnlike, piled with provisions and equipment. haven stares around; carries the crate to where a similar stack of crates are piled. lowering the crate he notes a shiny object, picks it up. it is a button from an army uniform. he pockets it as his attention is distracted by two horsemen passing outside. haven goes out to continue unloading.}
<L>__{exterior main office day}
<A>__{as the two horsemen ride up to pete and dismount. ben and sam are standing there.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(to the horsemen)}
<D>__{any luck?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no sign of joe. but there's the tracks of another horse, circling the mill and coming back on the road just north.}
<P>__{(he points)}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{that's bad.}
<A>__{he glances toward the wagon where haven is working.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{let's go and look at this guy again.}
<A>__{the five men move down to haven's wagon. angle on wagon and haven, as he sees them come. his lip tightens; then he relaxes and goes on lifting a crate. he pauses as they come up and stand around him, their eyes fixed on:}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you }
<A>__{haven looks at him.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you sure you didn't see no rider?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{look you want me to say i saw a rider? i will say it. i will say i saw a ghost. it don't make any difference to me.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{when did you get this job?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{yesterday.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{it's the system. if i don't work i don't eat. i never been able to find any way to beat it.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{who hired you?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(blandly)}
<D>__{mr. haven.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{the guy that had the fight?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{same fellow.}
<A>__{it is a risky little moment; haven eases both bruised hands into his coat pockets.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{friend of yours?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(innocently)}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{this haven.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{any man who gives me a job is my friend. look, i'm working, i haul this stuff out here. nobody wants to tell me where to dump it. everybody wants to know what i'm doin' and what i haven't seen. i don't know. i get thirty cents an hour. how smart does that have to make me?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{don't get hot.}
<A>__{pete's face relaxes; as do the grim faces of the others.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{i ain't hot. i'm just mixed up.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{forget it. i got a load for you to take back when you're done here.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{how soon?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{well, i haven't eaten anything but dust since sun up.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{all right grab it quick.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{work on this stuff.}
<A>__{they start unloading and haven goes to the cook house. pete watches him go. ben notes it.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{we risk him, that's all.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{he don't look right to me.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{he don't look any worse than the rest of it looks right now.}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{come on, get this junk out.}
<A>__{he lends a hand with ben and sam.}
