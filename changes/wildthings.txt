<ACTION>__{A place of money and privilege.  White coral buildings surround an open yard.  Tile roofs rise among banyan trees and banana palms, shimmering before a blue blaze of sky. Beyond the yard is the school's playing field and beyond that the waters of Biscayne Bay, dappled in sunlight where the sloops of the school's sailing class bob at their moorings. For a moment all is quiet.  Then, faintly, the HUM of many VOICES, rising and falling, LAUGHTER. The CAMERA PANS to the open windows of a building somewhat larger than the others.  The SOUNDS grow louder.}

The students are not unlike the campus, radiant, well-tended -- a veritable sea of adolescent sexuality -- bronze boys who seem to have just come from the boats or tennis courts -- girls in tight shorts riding high up shapely thighs, as... SAM LOMBARDO strolls out onto the stage.  The man is thirtyish, drop-dead handsome.  Dressed not that differently from the kids, in an Izod polo shirt, khakis and boat shoes. His entrance has an effect upon the audience, particularly upon the girls. KAREN and JANELLE, 16, pretty blondes, whisper then giggle. NICOLE, a dark-eyed beauty, 17 but going on 25, watches Sam's walk, then turns to the girl at her side... KELLY VAN RYAN, 17, a fully-developed knockout.}

Jimmy appears a bit more genuine, as does... SUZlE TOLLER, a boyish brunette, seated nearby, but with just enough space between her and everyone else to mark her as a loner.
