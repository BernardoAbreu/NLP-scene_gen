<L>__{interior art class day}
<A>__{starts with a pan across a wall of unimpressive high school art: dumb drawings of fighting chuck norris types, traced centerfolds, highly sexualized horses, etc. and, on a table, a wire sculpture made from two coathangers.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i'm not going to start a discourse on the subject of "good" art vs. "bad" art; these judgments are for each person to make on his own. i merely want to help each of you find the best way to look within yourselves the best key to your particular lock. last week i asked you to try and create a piece of artwork that responds to something that you have strong feelings about.}
<A>__{enid enters late and puts her sketchbook on the table.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{and it looks like we have some really interesting work up here....}
<A>__{roberta peruses some of the art, then points to a very violent drawing.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{what can you tell, us about your piece... uh...}
<P>__{(struggles to read signature)}
<D>__{...phillip?}
<C>__{phillip}
<P>__{(very stupid and nervous)}
<D>__{uh... it's uh... it's about the mutilator...}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{my goodness!}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{it's this really great video game about a guy who kills people with a big hammer...}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(trying to make a joke)}
<D>__{i thought maybe this was supposed to be your father.}
<A>__{no response from phillip. roberta nicks up enid's sketchbook and leafs through it.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{and what can you tell us about this...}
<P>__{(searches for name)}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{enid. it's sort of like a diary i guess.}
<A>__{we see several sketches, including the drawing of the satanists. roberta shows a few pages to the class.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i think that phillip and enid can help us to see that there are many different ways we can express ourselves. we can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. i hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.}
<P>__{(pause, points at wire sculpture)}
<D>__{who is responsible for this?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{talk to us about it...}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{it's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something i feel super strongly about.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{isn't this a wonderful piece, class? this definitely falls into that higher category of art i was speaking of earlier.}
<A>__{margaret glances over at enid. enid gives her a dirty look.}
