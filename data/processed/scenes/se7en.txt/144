<L>__{interior sports bar night}
<A>__{somerset and mills sit with a full pitcher of beer between them. the jukebox plays quietly for other customers. the walls of the bar are lined with trophies, ribbons and other victory symbols.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{there's not going to be a happy ending. it's not possible.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{if we get him, i will be happy enough.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{no. face it now. stop thinking it's good guys against the bad guys in this city.}
<A>__{mills drinks deep, pours more.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{how can you say that? especially after today?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{you tell me... when you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or, a wife murdered her husband in cold blood... and you have to wash the blood off their children. you put the killer in jail. who won?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{if i thought like you, i'd have slit my wrists a long time ago.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{where's the victory?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{you do your job. follow the law and do the best you can. it's all there.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{if we caught john doe tomorrow, and it turned out he was the devil... if it turned out he was literally satan, then, that might live up to our expectations. no human being could do these horrible things, right?! but, this is not the devil. it's only a man.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{why don't you shut the fuck up for a while?! huh? you make these speeches... like you know everything there is to know.}
<A>__{somerset sits back, looking at mills.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{you think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead? you think you're toughening me up? well, you're not!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you're quitting, fine... but i'm staying to fight.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{who are you fighting for? people don't want a champion. they just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{what the fuck is wrong with you, huh? what burnt you out?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{there's no one thing, if that's what you mean. i just... i can't live anymore where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{you're so much better than everyone, right? no one's worthy of you.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{wrong! i sympathize completely. because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you go insane. it's easier to smoke crack, and not worry that your wife and kids are starving to death. and, it's so much easier to bear a child till that child finally shuts up, because it takes so much work to love. and, if you bothered to think about the abuse, and the damage, you'd be sad.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{you're talking about people who are mentally ill. you're...}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(cuts in, furious)}
<D>__{no, i am not! i'm talking about common, everyday life here. where ignorance isn't bliss, it's a matter of survival.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{listen to yourself. you say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so i don't care about people." but, if you're not part of the solution...}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(cuts him off)}
<D>__{people who are in arguments over their heads always use meaningless slogans. but, life doesn't conform to analogies.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{you're already here, and you've been here a long time. so, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{that part of me is dead.}
<A>__{mills stands.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{fuck you. you want me to agree with you. "yeah, you're right, somerset, this place is fucked. let's go live in a fucking log cabin!" well, i don't agree with you. you're quitting, and it makes me sick. cause, you're the best i've ever seen.}
<A>__{mills digs out some money and throws it on the table.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{thanks for the beer.}
<A>__{mills leaves. other patrons watch him go. somerset takes out a cigarette. he goes to light it. the lighter will not light, and when it does, somerset's hand is shaking.}
