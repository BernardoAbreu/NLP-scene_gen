<L>__{exterior sara's cabin. late day}
<A>__{there's a huge fire going, with a cauldron hung over it. the hog hangs upside down from a tree, blood dripping into a}
<B>__{bowl.}
<A>__{there's a sense of ritual and order: the chapters of transforming the hog into food. sara is inside the cabin, the door open onto the yard. she holds the baby by the fireplace, swaddled up tight. she tries to put him to her breast, but he won't feed. she puts ethan back in his crib, comes outside. now inman is butchering the hog, chopping down either side of the spine to make two sides of meat. now sara is holding up a sheet of hog fat, as if it were a lace shawl. now she's rendering the fat into lard. now inman's salting the two hams. now sara's washing the intestine. she sings all the while i dreamed that my bower was full of red swine and my bride bed full of blood they don't really converse. inman continues to work. sara goes back inside to ethan's crib. inman glances back, but can hardly bear to, her anxiety so palpable. the baby is dead. she looks at it. she takes it up in her arms. kisses its forehead. makes a strange stifling noise. inman doesn't look at her. she comes out again, shovels some of the food into a plate, serves it up to inman, gently touching him as she does so. then serves out food for herself. inman starts to eat.}

<A>__{inman nods. she collects up the knapsacks, including inman's, and goes back inside the house with them. inman squats, eating, glancing back towards the cabin. there's the sudden shocking report of a revolver. inman, knowing what it is, goes slowly towards the house and its two dead bodies. his own face is a rictus, the eyes thin slits. if he gave into his grief it would never cease.}
