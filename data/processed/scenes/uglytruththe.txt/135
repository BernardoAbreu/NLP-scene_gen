<A>__{close on mike, as he addresses the camera. he holds a mic, wears a tuxedo and speaks in a hushed voice.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{as many of you know, sometimes a guy's gotta admit what he thought was the truth isn't necessarily the whole truth. yes, women have a checklist, but sometimes that list includes a foul mouthed idiot who took way too long to realize he was in love.}

<D>__{let's continue this conversation in a second.}
<A>__{we pull back to reveal mike is standing in a garden with rows and rows of wedding guests seated behind him. an altar with flowers and a minister wait patiently. mike gestures for the camera to follow him as he makes his way up to the altar. as he arrives he greets his groomsman, jonah, also wearing a tux. he only has eyes for joy, abby's bridesmaid.}

<D>__{zoom in on this, guys. i want the whole city to see how lucky i am.}

<C>__{mike}
<D>__{so, here it is, guys. the games, the manipulation, the ploys, the tactics... all the things we do to think we're in control. but guess what? we never are.}
<A>__{abby leans over his shoulder.}
<C>__{abby}
