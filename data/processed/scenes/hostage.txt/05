<L>__{interior kim's minimart day}
<A>__{junior kim, jr., is short, squat, and forty two years old. he's reading a magazine behind the counter when dennis and mars enter; dennis trying to disarm him with a smile as dennis reaches the counter, he lifts his tee shirt to reveal the butt of his pistol }
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{a pack of marlboros for my friend and all your cash, you gook motherfucker!}
<A>__{but junior kim is ready. he lurches to his feet, bringing up a pistol of his own }
<C>__{mars}
<D>__{he's got a gun!}
<A>__{dennis lunges across the counter, grabbing kim's gun, and the two men are suddenly locked in a ferocious death struggle for possession of the weapon }
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{mars, help me }
<A>__{dennis and kim bounce from the counter to the slurpy machine, the glock locked between them, pointing first one way, then the other, their eyes meeting as bam the gun goes off. junior kim's eyes widen. dennis and junior both look down at the red blossom that grows on junior kim's chest }
<C>__{kevin}
<P>__{(screaming in the background)}
<D>__{dennis! dennis, someone's coming!}
<A>__{kim falls into the slurpy machine, then slides to the floor. dennis scrambles over the counter and sprints for the door. but mars hesitates. instead of running, he picks up kim's gun, then leans over the counter to look at kim's body. we cannot see his face }
