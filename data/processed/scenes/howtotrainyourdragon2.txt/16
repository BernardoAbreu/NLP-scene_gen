<L>__{interior dragon mountain oasis continuous}
<A>__{... a stadium sized chamber teeming with ferns, waterfalls, hot springs and thousands of new dragons. hiccup wanders in, basking in the in the amazing sight: a dome of sweating ice capping a geothermal micro climate, filled with dragons of every shape and kind. he spots valka clinging to a basalt overhang, watching him.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{this is where you've been for twenty years?}
<A>__{she nods from her perch.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{you've been rescuing them.}
<A>__{she nods again, this time with a smile.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{unbelievable.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{you're not upset?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{what? no. i don't know. it's a bit much to get my head around, to be frank. it's not every day you find out your mother is some kind of crazy, feral, vigilante dragon lady.}
<A>__{valka chuckles, and using her dragon's wing, lowers herself to the ground like a skilled acrobat.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{at least i'm not boring... right?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{i suppose there is that...}
<P>__{(feeble, trailing off)}
<D>__{... one... specific... thing...}
<A>__{excited dragons rush up to greet hiccup and toothless. hiccup pets a few, marveling at the vast dragon utopia before him.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{do you like it?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{i don't have the words.}
<A>__{toothless snarls in annoyance as the curious, smothering dragons sniff every part of him.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{can i... ? he's beautiful!}
<A>__{she reaches out to stroke toothless, who purrs at her touch.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{incredible. he might very well be the last of his kind.}
<A>__{she inspects his talons as toothless rolls onto his back, nuzzling her.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{and look, he's your age! no wonder you get along so well.}
<A>__{hiccup smiles, astounded by toothless' affection for valka. she checks his teeth. they recede into the gums at her touch.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{and retractable teeth? ah! how did you manage to }
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{ i found him in the woods. he was shot down and wounded.}
<A>__{she winces and offers a sympathetic nod as she stands to caress a few of her own rescued dragons.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{this snafflefang lost his leg to one of drago bludvist's iron traps. this raincutter had her wing sliced by razor netting. and this poor hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree snare... then left to die alone and scared.}
<P>__{(re: toothless' tail)}
<D>__{and what of this? did drago or his trappers do this, too?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{heh. well, crazy thing is... i'm actually the one who shot him down.}
<A>__{she glares, confused.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{it's okay though. he got me back.}
<P>__{(playfully, to toothless)}
<D>__{right, bud? you couldn't save all of me, could you? you just had to make it even. so... peg leg!}
<A>__{hiccup rattles his prosthetic leg with a smirk. valka observes their playful rapport with curiosity.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{what did your father think of your night fury friend?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{he didn't take it all that well.}
<A>__{she mutters in agreement.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{but then... he changed. they all did. pretty soon everyone back home had dragons of their own.}
<A>__{she smiles at toothless, dismissive.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{if only it were possible.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{no, really, i }
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{ believe me, i tried, as well. but people are not capable of change, hiccup. some of us... were just born different.}
