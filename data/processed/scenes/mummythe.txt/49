<A>__{having just freshened up for bed, evelyn exits the temple and steps past the sleeping diggers. she spots the egyptologist, his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, the book of the dead laying loose under the other. evelyn stares at the book, nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks over, carefully steals it, and quickly tip toes away. lying on some blankets by the campfire, o'connell rolls over and sees evelyn, sitting wide eyed, staring at the book.}
