<L>__{interior storage lab night}
<A>__{a large missile slides back into a launcher that has been attached to the top of the alien attacker. some workers paint over the patch work repairs. below, mitchell briefs steve and david.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{we've hid the launcher in the ship's manifold.}
<A>__{mitchell takes a small black box from a table near by.}
<C>__{mitchell }
<D>__{this will be attached to the ships main console.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{it's just like an amraam launch pad on the stealths.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{exactly. use it the same way. only the nuke won't detonate on impact. you'll have another thirty seconds to get as far away as you can.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i will see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(checking his watch)}
<D>__{oh shit, we're late.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we'll meet you there.}
<A>__{steve dashes off as david moves toward the attacker. constance has been eavesdropping. she walks to david.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{thirty seconds? isn't that cutting it a little too close?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.}
<A>__{david leans under the attacker where a technician is attaching another device.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{it's the strongest shf transmitter we could get. it'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{then cross your fingers the shields go down.}
<A>__{david turns and walks away, constance following.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{with you? i don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{if anything goes wrong i will have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?}
<A>__{david stops, picking up a small trash can labelled "recycle."}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you know how i'm always trying to save the planet. this is my chance.}
<A>__{david rushes off. constance watches him leave.}
<C>__{constance}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{now he gets ambitious.}
