<D>__{you'll wait in the car.}
<A>__{ola has gotten out of his car and walks up the little path to the front door. michael waits. ola rings the bell, and after a moment, a rather pretty, middle aged woman answers, remaining behind the screen door. ola says a few things to her and she disappears, leaving the door open. ola comes down the steps, looks at michael, nodding to him. ola then gets into his car and drives off. michael walks up the walkway and enters the little house, closing the door behind him. this woman, terri roth, is in the kitchen, looking out at michael.}
