<L>__{exterior marron estate poolside early morning}
<A>__{a nanny sits in the early morning mist, embroidering. frank is kneeling with fletcher beside the pool. he's putting new batteries into fletcher's boat. fletcher watches him as he tears off the wrapping from the batteries, much preoccupied.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<P>__{(watching him)}
<D>__{she's real mad at you, isn't she?}
<A>__{frank stops what he's doing and just looks blankly at the batteries in his hands. there's a beat of silence.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{she told me she doesn't understand why you're so shitty to her...}
<A>__{frank's shoulders droop and he lets out an imperceptible sigh. he gently resumes fitting the batteries, still not looking at fletcher. in the quiet of early morning, it's almost like a confessional.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i've spent a lot of time learning not to react to things like other people do. it's my job. but it doesn't always work, fletcher... it doesn't always work.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{i don't think i understand.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{i'm an old man compared to you, pal, and i don't understand either. and i'm starting to get the feeling i never will.}
<A>__{there's a crunch of footsteps behind him. he looks around. with a big flourish, a copy of daily variety is put down in front of us, front page upwards.}
<C>__{nicki }
<D>__{ta da!}
<A>__{frank takes in that it's nicki then glances at variety, lying on the concrete beside him. splashed across the top, the headlines announce the day's news of the academy award nominations. rachel's name is among the best actress nominees. the hollywood reporter follows. frank picks up variety and stares at it. nicki stands beside him with the morning's mail under her arm.}
<C>__{nicki}
<P>__{(looking at him)}
<D>__{thought you'd like to know. everyone said she was a sure thing. of course, you know all about that.}
<A>__{she raises an eyebrow, gives him a look. frank looks steadily back at her. she drops a small pile of mail beside the magazines... several letters and a small packet. she's embarrassed by frank's gaze.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{i'm sorry. that was out of line. it's none of my business... here's today's question marks for you.}
<A>__{she turns and walks briskly back to the house. frank watches her go, then looks slowly down to the pile. from across the pool, fletcher watches silently, then pushes his boat out into the deep water.}
