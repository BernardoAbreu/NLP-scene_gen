<A>__{the town, off in the distance, nestled against the mountains. the sun, just coming up. closer, here, ramshackle structures, a long abandoned factory of some kind. schindler, in leather riding gear, climbs down off a moto guzzi motorcycle. he slowly wanders around, peers in through broken windows, wanders around some more. tight on his face, torn between conflicting choices, or realizing there's no choice, or only one choice, and hating it.}
