<L>__{interior houseboat night}
<A>__{sam is in the kitchen making dinner. jonah is sitting at the table, reading the letters from the stack they found by the door.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?}
<C>__{jonah}
<D>__{they called and asked for it.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"dear sleepless in seattle. you are the most attractive man i've ever laid ears on."}
<A>__{jonah rolls his eyes, tosses the letter into a pile of rejects, opens another.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{how did they get our phone number?}
<C>__{jonah}
<D>__{you have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.}
<A>__{sam nods as if this makes perfect sense.}
<C>__{jonah}
<P>__{(continues, reading)}
<D>__{"dear sleepless in seattle: i am an swf" }
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{thank god. something you don't know. it's a single white female.}
<C>__{jonah}
<D>__{this is no good. she's looking for someone french. or greek.}
<P>__{(puzzled, he throws the}
<D>__{letter into the reject}
<P>__{pile, opens another)}
<D>__{"dear sleepless in seattle: i live in tulsa." where is that? }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{oklahoma. do you know where that is?}
<C>__{jonah}
<D>__{somewhere in the middle.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school. i am not going to think about it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{generally speaking i think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here }
<C>__{jonah}
<D>__{she's willing to fly anywhere.}
<A>__{as jonah hands sam the picture.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{she looks like my third grade teacher. i hated my third grade teacher. hold it! wait a minute! she is my third grade teacher!}
<C>__{jonah}
<D>__{dad, you're not taking this seriously.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{this is not how you do it.}
<P>__{(referring to the hamburger)}
<D>__{you want this on an english muffin or a bun?}
<C>__{jonah}
<D>__{english muffin. how do you do it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or }
<C>__{jonah}
<D>__{ a slice of pizza }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{but not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what i mean.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i wonder if it still works this way.}
<C>__{jonah}
<D>__{it doesn't. they ask you.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm starting to notice that.}
