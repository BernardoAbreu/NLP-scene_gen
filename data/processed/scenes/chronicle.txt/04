<A>__{clark street is a slummy mess; dead lawns, potholes in the street in a downtrodden suburb of portland oregon. andrew carries the camera loosely at his side before getting into the passenger side of a car. in the driver's seat is matt garrety, 17, with messy hair. he's disaffected, and more than a little cynical; the reasoned demeanor of an unpretentious high school intellectual.}
