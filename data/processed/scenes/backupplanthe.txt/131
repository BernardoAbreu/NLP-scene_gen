<L>__{exterior 14th street day}
<A>__{zoe runs across 14th street. the blanket flaps behind her like a cape. she looks like a hugely pregnant super hero. and suddenly, she has to slow down and then stop completely for a contraction. she leans against a parked van to steady herself.}

<D>__{ow. son of a bitch, that hurts.}
<C>__{olivia}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<A>__{out of the corner of her eye, zoe sees an enormous strawberry on the side of the van. and then next to it, she sees olivia.}
