<L>__{int hospital room}
<A>__{mccloy's strapped down, but manages to reach the call button and push it. again and again.}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<D>__{no use, my friend. the medical staff wants no part of this. doctors don't fancy the idea of dying any more than anybody else.}
<A>__{mccloy stares at nekhorvich for a long moment.}
<C>__{mccloy}
<D>__{how could i possibly be infected?}
<A>__{nekhorvich shrugs.}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<D>__{that's exactly what gradski said 27 hours before he died. with chimera, the most minute exposure can be fatal.}
<A>__{mccloy again looks at his vital sign on the monitor. he grips the edge of the hospital bed.}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<D>__{but then you shouldn't be feeling to ill. not for another three of four hours anyway.}
<A>__{mccloy breaks a fresh sweat in a sudden spasm of anxiety.}
<C>__{mccloy}
<D>__{you have bellerophon.}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<P>__{(mildly)}
<D>__{do i?}
<C>__{mccloy}
<D>__{you took it! all of it! and what if i need it?}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{'if?' my, my, my...the five hundred people on bruny island that you deliberately infected with chimera needed it as well.}
<C>__{mccloy}
<D>__{oh, please! how was i to know they had to be treated with bellerophon within twenty hours?}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<D>__{by asking me.}
<C>__{mccloy}
<D>__{you still don't get it, do you? you want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs i needed to know just how bad the disease was in the real world, not the lab. and you never know til you try. you thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas. but i saw you creating a disease so terrible in chimera that the cure would be priceless.}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<D>__{you wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.}
<C>__{mccloy}
<D>__{well, the thought had occurred to me. i needed chimera in order to peddle bellerophon. for hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. now that's not so difficult to understand, is it? look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo! not anymore!..have you any idea the r&d money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium? if i couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there i can make on!..there it is. i've confessed. i, john c. mccloy, am in business to make money. lilly's making billions feeding prozac to depressed dogs. pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, jesus, who do i have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<D>__{you know, i think it's a little late for that. do give my regards to gradski if you see him.}
