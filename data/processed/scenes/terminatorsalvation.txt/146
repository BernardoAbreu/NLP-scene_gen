<A>__{kyle steers toward the woods, dodging between the thick trees. too many obstacles for the tank here, it screeches to a halt and lets off a jet of flame. the trees behind the atv all ignite, turning to acrid pools of melting plastic. kyle barely stays ahead of the fire. the tank backs up and takes a new route, around the woods. in the woods, kyle strikes a glancing blow against a tree trunk, and the atv topples on its side, spilling its passengers. after a beat, they rise, shaken.}
