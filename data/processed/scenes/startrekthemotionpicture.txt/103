<D>__{one hundred kilometers...}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{hold relative position here...}
<A>__{kirk's voice is blotted out by a deafening, shrill ing sound, accompanied by a multi hued point of light which explodes into blinding intensity, obscuring everything for an instant. overlapping this action, we hear:}
<C>__{computer's voice}
<D>__{intruder alert...! intruder alert!}
<A>__{continues. the plasma energy probe (o) the blinding light fades and in its lace we see a strange "entity" shocking us with its frightening appearance and its ugly sounding throbbing hum of power. it is about seven feet tall and resembles a "blob" of raw energy in shifting patterns and colors of deep, ugly hues of upper spectrum violet. yet, it looks strangely alive. at the end of the "tendril" (of light) is an "eye" (a small multi colored device) crew reactions elevators in b.g. (o) the bridge crew reacting hard, shocked and shaken the throbbing sound of the alien thing intensifies as it begins to move across the bridge. suddenly, in b.g., an elevator door snaps oen and two security men burst onto the bridge, phasers drawn. chekov shouts warningly at the men:}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{no weapons...!}
<A>__{but chekov is too late: first security man fires the blast harmlessly absorbed by the probe which emits a screeching nerve grating sound sends out a small whiplash energy bolt which instantly envelopes first security man in a purple glow (of implosion). second security man has almost lifted his phaser but now carefully, slowly is moving his hand away from his weapon. closer the security men (o) purple glow fades, the first security man has simply vanished. full shot bridge chekov, like the others, horrified, flips a switch and the computer voice ("intruder alert") goes off. at the same time chekov speaks into his intercom:}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{security... do not send further teams!}
<A>__{the probe is sending out snake like tendrils to the various consoles on the bridge. these tendrils lash out in a cobra strike movement, the tendril head seeming to enter into the console affected at which time all monitors and instrument lights there come on as if the probe is "reading" each console function. the crew carefully stays clear of the tendrils. spock has risen, moving to kirk's side as he slowly brings his tricorder up, very carefully extracting its tiny sensor and aiming it at the probe.}
<C>__{chekov}
<P>__{(shaken)}
<D>__{no intruder readings on other decks, captain...}
<P>__{(to spock)}
<D>__{can that be one of their crew?}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{a probe from their vessel...}
<P>__{(to kirk)}
<D>__{a plasma energy combination...}
<A>__{meanwhile, the probe is now hovering near chekov who sits frozen, fists clenched, jaw tight.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{don't interfere with it...!}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{absolutely, i will not interfere!}
<A>__{angle including spock's console (o) as the "probe" withdraws an energy tendril from one bridge station and "inserts" it into another console.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no one interfere...! it doesn't seem interested in us only the ship...!}
<A>__{kirk's words are never completed as suddenly all the energy tendrils withdraw from all consoles and a larger, more powerful looking tendril lashes out , snaking into the science console complex .}
<B>__{closer on science console}
<A>__{where, also immediately, all the console and computer lights are suddenly flashing wildly, rapidly there is an incredibly fast exchange of high pitched bees the computer obviously in unauthorized commu nication with the probe !}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{computer off !}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{it's taken control of the computer...!}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{it's running our records! starfleet strength, earth defenses...}
<A>__{as decker moves to the main power control, spock now steps in, his vulcan strength easily brushing kirk and decker aside. spock clasps his fists above his head, brings it down in a shattering blow on the console. it splits open ! as the bridge lights dim even more, and as the science console shorts itself out and off, decker confronts spock:}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{we could have cut it off at the main computer...}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{this served the purpose.}
<A>__{kirk has been giving spock a puzzled look spock now turns abruptly, and: another angle (o) as spock, in stepping back, accidentally brushes the probe's energy tendril a flash of light at the contact point sends spock sinning under the rail and to the floor near ilia. the probe's energy tendril has withdrawn from the darkened science console, hov ers high over the dazed spock as if angrily seeking the reason for the break in its computer contact. spock starts to rise.}
<C>__{ilia}
<D>__{mr. spock, don't move...!}
<A>__{decker steps toward her, ad libbing a grim " ilia ...!" but he has no chance as: closer on ilia (o) the probe hovers over her, its whole mass seemingly about to envelope her with a single tendril extended toward her , somehow freezing her into immobility and then the entire probe dissolves in a blinding flash of white, obscuring ilia. almost instantly the white flash fades but ilia has vanished her tricorder clattering to the deck. across the navigator's station to kirk and decker helpless, shocked, gazing at the place ilia was but which is now empty.}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(to kirk, quiet fury)}
<D>__{this is how i define unwarranted!}
<A>__{and almost at the same moment a new bridge alarm}
<B>__{signal.}
<A>__{the alarm still sounding as from the giant alien ves sel, we see strange, opaque energy patterns streaking toward us. kirk vaults to the command chair, lunges for controls, as decker races to the weapons defense console.}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(voice amplified)}
<D>__{the ship is under attack...! man all defensive stations...!}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{forcefields, full remaining strength...! total reserve!}
<A>__{appropriate alarm klaxons, and computer voices begin sounding, and all this is lost in a sudden shrilling sound (a constant, high pitched tone). for a moment the energy patterns are prominent on the viewer and then the patterns vanished and the shrill sound fades and: favor the viewer (o) showing v'ger growing rapidly in size. the enterprise is being pulled along the length of the big ship, toward its "prow."}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(to decker)}
