<A>__{teague's men ride up to the farm. esco's out in the field, labouring away, but with his shotgun by him. teague stops alongside the field, the rail between him and esco. esco stops working, picks up his shotgun and goes over. teague has four men with him. mo and jo, the twins, huge, and with the appearance of having less than one brain between the two of them, grayling, a reluctant looking man, funereal in his bearing, and bosie.}
