<A>__{walls are painted with famous copies of durer, brueghel, goya and bosch depictions of death. fine wooden coffins line the walls. candles burn in sconces, casting alternate shadows and pools of light. armand walks through, gesturing louis and claudia to follow him. as they walk through, vampire man and women appear out of the shadows like wraiths, startling them, drifting around them, stroking them, touching claudia as if she were a doll. shrieks of preternatural laughter. armand gestures to the vampires to back off. all obey but estelle.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{such a darling.}
<A>__{she menaces claudia, her breasts enormous, her fangs bared. armand throw her a look, and she is flung against the wall. louis stares around. the vampires faces drift towards him and away, always disclosing the face of armand, who seems some distance away, but strangely close, staring at louis with a constantly calm, hypnotic gaze. then a young mortal boy comes from the shadows with a candelabra, which he hands to armand. armand and the boy come towards them, leading them along the walls, his candelabra illuminating the ghastly murals, his face gleaming like an angel above the candleflame.}

<D>__{monstrous.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{yes, and very beautiful.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{your lips, they didn't move.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{they did, but too fast for you to see them. no magic, just grace and speed.}
<A>__{the boy is watching louis. armand's hand beckons and the boy draws up to louis in the candlelight. he places his arms on louis' shoulders. louis glances at armand, who smiles. louis sees the puncture marks on the boy's neck.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{he wants you...}
<A>__{louis is utterly confused. can't resist. drinks his blood. the boy's body presses against him, sensual, willing. the other vampires appear all around louis, who suddenly senses it and draws away, ashamed. claudia watches warily, from a distance. armand beckons at her and louis and open a door in the wall which reveals a stone staircase.}
