<L>__{interior the house late afternoon}
<A>__{indy approaches the half open front door.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{dad?}
<P>__{(to brody)}
<D>__{he's an academic a bookworm. he's not a field mans}
<A>__{he pushes open the door. he enters the house and calls out.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{dad? dad?}
<A>__{indy opens one half of the curtains dividing the hall from the sitting room. we see the place has been ransacked. brody sees indy's face and opens the other half.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{dear god.}
<A>__{they walk into the room.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what has the old fool got himself into now?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i don't know. but whatever it is, he's in over his head!}
<A>__{brody picks up some mail from henry's cluttered desk.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{dad?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{it's today's mail. and it's been opened.}
<A>__{indy turns and sees the pile of torn papers and envelopes. then something hits him.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{mail! that's it, marcus!}
<A>__{he immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from his college office and finds the envelope with the venice postmark.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(as he tears it open)}
<D>__{venice, italy!}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{indy uncovers a small book. it looks like a journal or diary. indy flips through it: page after page of handwritten notes and drawings. brody glances at it with great curiosity.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{it's dad's grail diary. every clue he ever followed. every discovery he made. a complete record of his search for the holy grail. this is his whole life. why would he have sent this to me?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i don't know. but someone must want it pretty badly.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{do you believe, marcus?}
<A>__{as indy asks the question, he turns to a painting on the wall: a depiction of christ on the cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice. a second painting on the wall shows eleventh century crusaders plummeting to their deaths over a high cliff. one crusader, however, floats safely in midair because he holds the grail in his hands.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{do you believe the grail actually exists?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{the search for the cup of christ is the search for the divine in all of us.}
<A>__{brody sees that indy is unsatisfied by this response.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{but if you want facts, indy, i have none to give you. at my age, i'm prepared to take a few things on faith.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{call donovan, marcus. tell him i will take that ticket to venice now.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i will tell him we'll take two.}
