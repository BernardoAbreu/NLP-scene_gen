<A>__{it's late and we see lynn sitting at the kitchen table alone. sam has not come home and she is clearly worried. and then we hear a car pulling up outside, door opening and closing, and sam coming into the trailer.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sorry i'm late.}
<A>__{lynn staring at him, trying to read this man's face but he's not looking at her. avoiding her gaze. did he use? is he high? and then she sees a pinprick of dried blood on his shirtsleeve. her face contorting almost imperceptibly. her worst fear realized. relapse. and she moves to him without saying a word... lifts up his arm and unbuttons the cuff of his shirt... slowly pushing up his shirtsleeve to discover a needle prick in his arm... ... and then he pulls out a $20 bill and hands it to her.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{gave blood over in pitt.}
<A>__{lynn searching his eyes and she knows he's telling the truth.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{that's all i got.}
<A>__{and she pulls him close, hugging him tight, grateful.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{somethin will come through. i promise.}
<A>__{and we hold on sam, his troubled eyes. completely out of options. and we see that for this man the inability to provide for his family is crushing.}
