<L>__{interior back room night}
<A>__{a dark, panelled room, with a few comfortable chairs, a business desk with a typewriter and terminal (where we saw flynn working in scenes 29, 33, etc.), and a couple of video games flynn's favorites. as flynn, lora, and alan enter, they find the arcade noise considerably muffled. flynn settles into a chair; alan leans against a game, nervous; lora paces.}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(stretching his arms, relaxing)}
<D>__{so...how's the world of serious science?}
<C>__{lora}
<D>__{have you been sneaking into the icom system?}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{whew. you never were much for small talk.}
<P>__{(to alan)}
<D>__{she still leave her clothes all over the floor?}
<A>__{alan looks profoundly uncomfortable.}
<C>__{lora}
<D>__{flynn!}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{uh, no ... i mean, not that often }
<A>__{flynn laughs.}
<C>__{lora}
<P>__{(to alan, indicating arcade)}
<D>__{you can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{touche, honey. yeah, i've been doing a little hacking here. which i've got every reason, as you well know...}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{you did break in.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{tried to.}
<P>__{(nods toward terminal)}
<D>__{can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. if i had a direct terminal ...}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{are you embezzling?}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(sydney greenstreet)}
<D>__{"embezzling" is such an ugly word, mister bailey...}
<P>__{(normal voice)}
<D>__{no, actually i'm trying to get a legal brief together.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(to lora)}
<D>__{you haven't told him?}
<A>__{she shakes her head.}
<C>__{flynn }
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{sherman, set the wayback machine for...oh, 1973. kevin flynn}
<P>__{(points to himself)}
<D>__{is one of the brightest young software engineers at icom. he's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...}
<P>__{(waves at one of the games in the room)}
<D>__{...space paranoids.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{you invented space paranoids?}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{yepper. and vice squad, and meltdown... whole slew of 'em. i was this close}
<P>__{(gestures)}
<D>__{to starting my own little enterprise. but: enter ed dillinger. another software engineer not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. one night, our boy flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. a big blank. we now take you to three months later. ed dillinger presents icom with five video games he has "invented" the slime didn't even change the names and he gets a big fat promotion. thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, executive v.p.?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{senior exec.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{oh my. meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in space paranoids machines and i'm not seeing one dime.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. if i got in far enough, i could reconstruct it.}
<C>__{flynn }
<D>__{my password ... dillinger's instruction to divert the data ...}
<C>__{lora}
<D>__{i'm afraid it's a little late for that. dillinger's shut off group 7 access. he must know what you're up to.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{boy, i bet i know who's workin' late tonight.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{dillinger?}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{yeah. tryin' to find the file and erase it. once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. just eddie and his master control program, runnin' things from on high..}
<C>__{lora}
<D>__{don't even say that. you've got to find that file before he does..}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{not much chance of that now. the mcp can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{not if my tron program was running. that would seal the system off. if your file's in there...}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{boy, if we were inside, i know how to forge us a group 6 access...}
<A>__{they all look at each other. after a beat, lora holds the keys to her van aloft.}
<C>__{lora}
<D>__{shall we dance?}
