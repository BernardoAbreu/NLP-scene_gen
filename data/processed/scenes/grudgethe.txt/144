<A>__{karen runs towards us, breathless, stopping as she reaches the house. looming over her. waiting. she only hesitates a moment before running inside.}

<A>__{karen enters, calling out:}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{doug! where are you???}
<A>__{a muffled sound from upstairs. a voice.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{doug???}
<A>__{karen immediately runs up the stairs to the second floor. before she reaches the top of the stairs, karen suddenly realizes: the voice she's hearing isn't doug's.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{hey, maria, it's me. yeah, i'm still at school...}
<A>__{karen slowly looks up to see peter. she recognizes him immediately. he's standing in the hallway, talking on his cell phone.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{...i know, i'm sorry these staff meetings always run over maybe another ten minutes or so okay, i will be home soon i love you too.}
<A>__{he hangs up. leans against the wall. looking into the front bedroom. karen gasps as she sees toshio through the open door. he's sitting on the ground, making drawings of black cats. this is his bedroom.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{guess your mom's late, huh?}
<A>__{then toshio suddenly looks up. right at karen. following toshio's gaze, peter quickly turns to face karen. but even though she's right there, he doesn't see her: she's seeing something that happened three years ago. as if sensing her presence, peter walks right to the edge of the stairs, looking down. then: a rustling sound comes from the dark hallway. peter turns towards the rear bedroom at the end of the hall.}
