<P>__{(to the pilot)}
<D>__{put your mask on.}
<A>__{quaritch leaps out of his seat, heading aft as jake grabs the edge of a weapons pod, his feet dangling over open space. holding his breath, quaritch blows a rescue hatch and leans outside. jake sees him aim his massive pistol. k wham! k wham! rounds clang next to jake's head. he lets go, plummeting into the trees jake plunges through jungle canopy. he catches a huge leaf, as neytiri taught him it bends down, breaking his fall he lets go, dropping again only to catch another leaf, and then another, and we rush down with him through this green blur. jake drops to the ground in a feral crouch. unhurt.}

<D>__{on it.}
<A>__{she banks hard, pulling g's, coming around on the dragon. she pours on the coal and the samson leaps forward, straight at the warship. quaritch, drills a stream of tracers at her, tearing through her canopy, ripping chunks off her fuselage. in the jungle below, norm watches her kamikaze run }
<C>__{norm}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{trudy}
<P>__{(clipped, pilot like)}
<D>__{norm, i love you.}
<A>__{trudy dives, raking through treetops and then, at the last instant, yanks back on the stick and the samson leaps straight up and k krash!! shears off the cockpit of the dragon as quaritch throws himself aft along the aisle and trudy's samson disintegrates, the wreckage burning as it tumbles into the jungle. miles quaritch grips the bulkhead as he stares out the open front of the fuselage. wind howls through wreckage where the pilot used to be. the forest rushes up to meet him and the dragon crashes through splintering trees, impacting in a lake with a white blast of water.}
