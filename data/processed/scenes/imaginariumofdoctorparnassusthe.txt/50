<T>__{cut to george :}
<A>__{who is peeling potatoes, badly. parnassus and percy come up behind him.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{george... we'd like to know who you really are.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what?... yes. me too.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{i may be able to help.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{really? what?... how...?}
<A>__{percy produces a small contraption with wires from behind his back and gives it to dr parnassus.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{hold this piece of wire.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{you won't feel a thing.}
<A>__{george takes the end of the wire.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{i'm going to put the tips of my fingers on the top of your head.}
<A>__{he does so.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus }
<D>__{i want you to relax and try as far as possible to think of nothing.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that's not difficult... in my condition.}
<A>__{doctor parnassus closes his eyes. he seems to be making an effort.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{hold your breath.}
<A>__{george does so.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus }
<D>__{very good, very good. yes... yes, i see... i see... very interesting.}
<A>__{doctor parnassus takes his hand from george's head and gives the contraption back to percy.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{you may breathe normally.}
<A>__{the effort seems to have tired parnassus. he needs to sit down.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what... ?}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{alas, this technique has its limitations.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{but... did you discover anything?}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<P>__{(dramatically)}
<D>__{your name.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{my name?... what is it?}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{anthony shepherd.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{my god! that's it! you're right! anthony shepherd! they call me tony. tony shepherd! that's who i am!}
<A>__{valentina and anton begin to pay attention and gather around.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{and... you used to do good works. something to do with charity i think.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{yes...that's right! that's right! but how?...}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<P>__{(dismissively)}
<D>__{it's an ancient technique of mental divination, but i'm very rusty and it doesn't always work satisfactorily.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{but that's amazing! brilliant!}
<P>__{(oddly concerned)}
<D>__{was there anything else?}
<A>__{doctor parnassus shakes his head, no.}
<C>__{tony }
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{that's absolutely fantastic! thank you. perhaps i will remember other things.}
<A>__{parnassus smiles and bows slightly ironically.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{charity work? i knew you were a good person.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{so what was he doing dangling under a bridge from his neck?}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{percy!}
<C>__{percy}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{oh dear, was that a rude question? have i put my foot in it?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{that's so strange. and horrible.. it's a complete blank. but i do remember i was involved in some sort of charity.. trying to do good, to make the world a better place, you know...inspire people, give them hope....}
<P>__{(self deprecatingly)}
<D>__{what an arrogant idiot.}
<A>__{valentina looks at him thinking `what a sympathetic person.' the sound of a flutey whistle distracts him. anton is blowing a tune on the metal tube he found on the bridge.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(with a superior air)}
<D>__{mozart's flute concerto in g.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i mean, the pipe. where did you get it?}
<A>__{anton looks at the metal pipe.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{i found it.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{it's mine.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{oh. you're a musician n now.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{it's not a musical instrument. may i have it?... please.}
<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{are you s sure it's yours?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{positive.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{alright.}
<A>__{anton appears to offer the pipe to tony but palms it so that when tony reaches out to take it, it's gone.}
<C>__{anton }
<D>__{it's g gone.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(getting shirty)}
<D>__{don't fool around.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{ah, there it is.}
<A>__{tony once more tries to take it. once more anton makes it disappear.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{give it to me!}
<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(derisively)}
<D>__{oooooh!}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{anton, that's enough.}
<A>__{she steps forward, takes the pipe from anton and gives it to}
<B>__{tony.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{dr. parnassus, who's been watching this exchange, looks thoughtful.}
