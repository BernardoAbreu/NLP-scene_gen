<L>__{interior hotel suite day}
<A>__{harvey enters the room. he places his case on the bed, takes off his jacket and goes to the window. a roller blind is pulled down. harvey tugs on the cord, to no avail at first. then suddenly it whips up, causing harvey to duck backwards as the flailing cord almost takes his eye out. warily, harvey steps forward and looks down at the busy street below. he goes to open the window but it is stuck. he tries again but it won't budge. he looks around the room, then up at the now fully contracted blind. tentatively he reaches up and pulls the cord to lower the blind a little. it slowly starts to unravel and unravel...and unravel, until it hits the bottom of the window sill with a gentle thud. harvey stands in semi darkness. just then, to his relief, his phone rings. he hurries over to the bed and retrieves it.}
