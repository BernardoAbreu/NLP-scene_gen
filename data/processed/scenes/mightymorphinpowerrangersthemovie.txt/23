<L>__{exterior command center night}
<A>__{the rangers climb a mountain path, all of them looking alarmed. up ahead, there's a pillar of black smoke rising from the command center.}
<L>__{interior command center night}
<A>__{the place is trashed there's smoking debris, ravaged panels, exposed wires and mechanisms. the kids move through the wreckage in numb silence.}
<C>__{tommy }
<D>__{... what happened here?...}
<A>__{adam spots alpha's arm protruding from a mound of rubble.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{guys!}
<A>__{the kids quickly uncover the battered robot.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{alpha, are you okay?!}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{i will get you my pretty, and your little dog toa!!}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{he must've blown an anitromic demodulator!}
<C>__{kimberly }
<D>__{oh, no...}
<A>__{everybody follows kimberly's gaze, thunderstruck expressions coming over them. laying on a destroyed bed of crystals is zordon. he is still a shimmering spectral being, only now he s aged a good fifty years. the kids stand over him, forlorn.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{... what's happening to him?'}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{we have to help him!}
<A>__{zordon opens his eyes.}
<C>__{zordon}
<D>__{... rangers... thank goodness you're safe.}
<A>__{the kids drop down beside him.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{we have to get you back inside your time warp.}
<C>__{zordon}
<D>__{i'm afraid that's impossible... the power has been destroyed. it's gone... the zords, the weapons... all of it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the mighty morphin power rangers are no more.}
<A>__{the kids are stunned. kimberly gently takes zordon's hand.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{zordon... you can't leave us. ever since you came into our lives... you've been like another father `to us all. }
<C>__{zordon}
<D>__{... you must be strong... ivan almost overthrew the planet once... and now i'm afraid he has the strength to see his scheme through.}
<A>__{zordon closes his eyes. tommy puts a hand on kimberly's shoulder. the kids slowly rise, all of them looking utterly despondent. billy turns to alpha.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{what're we going to do?}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{i do not like green eggs and ham! i do not like them, sam i am!}
<A>__{billy opens a panel on alpha's back, makes an adjustment. alpha's head rolls back like he's going to sneeze.}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{ah ah ahhhh choo!!}
<A>__{sparks burst from where his nose should be. he sniffs.}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{thanks, billy.}
<A>__{rocky hands alpha a hanky, alpha wipes his nose area.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{there has to be something we can do.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{come on, guys, think!}
<A>__{aisha turns to alpha.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{alpha. is there any way we can defeat this monster? any way at all?}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{... perhaps there is a way... i have heard tales of another power.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{... they say that somewhere beyond the hyperion constellation there exists a mythological power that is beyond all comprehension.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{how can we get to it?}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{as the legend goes, the power is impossible to obtain.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{we have to try, alpha. it's our only hope.}
<A>__{alpha shakes his head.}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{it's far too dangerous. zordon would never allow it.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{if we don't try, zordon won't survive!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{if ivan ooze isn't stopped, nobody will survive.}
<A>__{alpha heaves a sigh.}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{ay, yi, yi, yi.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the legend speaks of a master warrior who lives on the planet phaedos... this is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{how can we reach phaedos?}
<A>__{alpha heaves a sigh.}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{zordon's going to have my orbicular spheroids when he hears out about this!}
<A>__{the kids exchange curious looks as alpha opens a compartment and removes a vile filled with radioluminescent energy.}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{this is an emergency reserve of morphonic emissions. it should be enough to get you there.}
<A>__{he approaches a damaged panel, loads in the vile.}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{there is one problem. i only have enough reserve to send you phaedos... i can't bring you back.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{so how do we get back?}
<A>__{alpha gives them a grim look.}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{... you'll have to pray that the legends are true.}
<A>__{alpha keys in coordinates.}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{you're sure you want to do this?! the rangers share purposeful looks.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{it's our only hope.}
<A>__{alpha shakes his head, punches in the final codes.}
<C>__{alpha}
<D>__{safe journey, rangers!}
<A>__{he pulls a lever.}
<C>__{alpha}
<D>__{be careful!!}
<A>__{the kids transform into six streaks of color and blast off through the ceiling. alpha shakes his head in despair.}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{ay, yi, yi, yi. they're doomed!!}
