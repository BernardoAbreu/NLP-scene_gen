<L>__{exterior freeway overpass day}
<A>__{straddling the desert like a giant, crumbling monument to a long dead civilization. eli steadily climbs his way up. he comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the overpass has collapsed at mid pointerior rusted iron rods jut out from where the roadway has been severed. eli just stands there at the edge for a moment, feeling the wind whip around him, his coat fluttering in the breeze. the overpass's collapsed section is now just a mountainous pile of rubble that leads down to the road below. eli steps onto the rubble. about to make his way down when he freezes. he hears something. the faintest of sounds. he takes cover, peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see: two people walking together on the road. we see everything from eli's p.o.v. too far to make out much detail, but apparently it is a middle aged couple. the man pushes along an old wheelbarrow covered by a tarp as the woman, seemingly his wife, walks alongside. the barrow's rusted wheel gives out a plaintive, rhythmic squeak. eli ducks down again as he hears something else. this time much louder. the menacing growl of motorcycle engines. four bikes in total. riding out of the horizon, closing in on the couple. they see the bikes coming and panic. try desperately to steer the barrow off the road. the bikes screech to a halt and the four riders dismount. brandishing a variety of weapons. the couple make a run for it but they're quickly chased down and tackled to the ground. the woman screams and struggles helplessly as the bikers swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals. the woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped from her. eli turns away. he knows what comes nexterior eli listens as the woman screams and screams. he reaches for his shotgun... hesitates... then withdraws his hand.}

<D>__{it ain't your concern. stay on the path. it ain't your concern. stay on the path.}
<A>__{eli repeats it like a mantra. he clearly wants to intervene, but will not permit himself to. instead, he simply sits and waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help. and then finally, suddenly, is silenced. down below, the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and bloodied in the dirt. the bikers tear the tarp from the wheelbarrow, spilling its contents onto the asphalt. they ferret through the items, scavenging a few items we don't see what and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel. they leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the direction they came, dust pluming in their wake. eli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded into the far distance before emerging from his hiding place.}
