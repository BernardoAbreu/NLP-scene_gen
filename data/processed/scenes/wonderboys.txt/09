<A>__{grady and crabtree watch suitcases tumble as miss sloviak sits across the way, inspecting her face in a compact.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{do you know how many times i've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? particularly while i'm on my way to pittsburgh.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{lay off pittsburgh. it's one of the great cities.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{if it can produce a miss sloviak you'll get no argument from me.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{she's a transvestite.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{you're stoned.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{she's still a transvestite.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{mm.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{isn't she?}
<A>__{crabtree ignores grady's question, smiling placidly as he watches the carousel spin.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{so how's the book?}
<A>__{grady stiffens. he had been expecting this, but not so soon. he tries to act casual.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{it's fine. it's done. basically. i'm just sort of. ..tinkering with it.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{great. i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime this weekend. think that might be possible?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm sort of at a critical. . . juncture .}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{i thought you were tinkering.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i just mean. . .}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{forget i asked. i don't want to pressure you, tripp. but...}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{...i get pressure. know what i mean?}
<A>__{grady ponders this, troubled by it. suddenly, crabtree's face brightens again.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{ah. ..well now. what do you suppose that would be?}
<A>__{grady turns, watches an immense pony hide case drop onto the carousel.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{that would be a tuba.}
