<A>__{mr. brooks is driving. mr. smith is in the passenger seat. both are lost in a wary silence. abruptly from the back seat:}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{i smell gun oil, a gun oil that's different than yours.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{he brought his gun. after he gets what he wants he plans to kill me.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{ah... now i get it. you were counting on that, weren't you?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{it has a certain logic.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{but if your plan is to have him kill you, why do you have to kill someone else first?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{he'll need to see that to get up the courage to kill me.}
<A>__{marshall roars with laughter.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{not even you believe that, earl. it makes it more exciting, doesn't it, to think he's going to kill you after you kill someone else. you're getting your rocks off big time, that's why you're doing it.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{not true... and if it were, so what?}
<P>__{(to mr. smith)}
<D>__{you're goddamn great, you know. to have the balls to do this.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{i'm pretty nervous but that's normal right?}
