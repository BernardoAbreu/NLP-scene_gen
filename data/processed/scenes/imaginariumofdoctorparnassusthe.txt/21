<D>__{... i was visited... by someone i had hoped never to meet.}
<A>__{in the distance, rising like a dark mountain, is a strange monastery. dim light comes from a couple of windows. we can hear, from far away, the indistinct droning voice of the story teller, a younger dr. parnassus. the camera moves up over and way ahead of the hooded rider, continuing through the snowstorm, over fields, forests, valleys, rocks, until it reaches the monastery, high on a rugged hill. here it enters one of the dimly lit monastery windows, taking us into a dining hall.}
