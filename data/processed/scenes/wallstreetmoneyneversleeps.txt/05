<A>__{two bedroom in a murray hill high rise. jacob watches fox business on his tv. a much nicer, much bigger, much flatter plasma sits against the wall under it waiting to be installed. a promo plays for a magazine show being narrated by cody willard.}
<C>__{cody willard }
<D>__{tomorrow night we explore the excesses of hedge fund managers.}
<A>__{different pictures flash on the screen of private jets, massive mansions, expensive watches and wines.}
<D>__{cody willard (on tv) (cont'd) whether they're spraying $5000 a bottle champagne at voile rouge in saint tropez, ordering a $10,000 martini at the algonquian hotel with a diamond on the bottom or eating a gold dusted $175 hamburger at the wall street burger shoppe...}
<A>__{now the flashes are of some of the top hedge fund managers in the business that we'll see later... one of them is a man named bretton woods... maybe we hold a little longer on him to get a good look... mid 40s, good looking and refined.}
<D>__{cody willard (on tv) (cont'd) ... these cowboys of finance always seem to land on their feet.}
<A>__{jacob lets out a little laugh and mutes the tv. he grabs the phone and makes a call...}

<D>__{i know you're at the fund raiser tonight but i wanted to say hi.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{okay, best part... getting my bonus check. worst part...}
<A>__{he grabs a framed picture of her and looks at it. she's in workout gear, wearing earbuds, obviously just off a run, caught off guard and thus flipping him the finger... it's adorable.}
<C>__{jacob }
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{... it was right after i ordered lunch and i remembered that we're not seeing each other this weekend.}
<A>__{and he finishes his message to her...}
<C>__{jacob }
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{okay, text me yours and i will read them in my sleep. i love you.}
<A>__{as jacob disconnects and looks out the window... looking out at third avenue twinkling up into midtown.}
