<A>__{nine men, arrayed as in the photograph, but with kane beaming in the center of the first row. the men, variously with mustaches, beards, bald heads, etc. are easily identified as being the same men, reilly prominent amongst them. as camera pulls back, it is revealed that they are being photographed by an old type professional photographer, big box, black hood and all in a corner of the room. it is 1:30 at night. desks, etc. have been pushed against the wall. running down the center of the room is a long banquet table, at which twenty diners have finished their meals. the eleven remaining at their seats these include bernstein and leland are amusedly watching the photographic ceremonies.}

<D>__{make up an extra copy and mail it to the "chronicle."}

<A>__{applause.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{however, i think you'll agree we've heard enough about newspapers and the newspaper business for one night. there are other subjects in the world.}
<A>__{he puts his two fingers in his mouth and lets out a shrill whistle. this is a signal. a band strikes up a lively ditty of the period and enters in advance a regiment of very magnificent maidens, as daringly arrayed as possible in the chorus costumes of the day. the rest of this episode will be planned and staged later. its essence is that kane is just a healthy and happy young man having a wonderful time. as some of the girls are detached from the line and made into partners for individual dancing }
