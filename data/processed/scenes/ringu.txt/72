<A>__{asakawa is on the phone, her voice almost frantic.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{thats right. after yamamura shizuko committed suicide, professor ikuma took the daughter and ran. no, no one knows where they went. thats why i need you to find out where they are. even if the professors dead, sadako should still be in her forties. ill explain it all later, but right now just hurry!}
<A>__{asakawa slams the phone down. pan to show ryuji slumped in one corner of the room, his back to the wall.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{sadakos probably already dead. she could kill people with just a thought, remember? her mother wasnt even close to that.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{well, what about that video? if sadakos dead then who made it?}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{nobody made it. it wasnt made at all. that video... is the pure, physical manifestation of sadakos hatred.}
<A>__{ryuji turns to regard asakawa, his eyes blank.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{weve been cursed.}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence before mr. hayatsu slides the door open, almost falling into the room. he is out of breath, and speaks rapidly.}
<C>__{hayatsu}
<D>__{its no good. with the typhoon coming in, all ships are temporarily staying docked.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{what about the fishing boats? tell their captains ill pay.}
<C>__{hayatsu}
<D>__{fishing boats? sir, without knowing whether this typhoon is going to hit us or not, i think itd be better to wait and see how things turn }
<A>__{ryuji interrupts him, slamming both palms on the table. glasses rattle wildly.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{fine! ill try searching myself!}
<A>__{ryuji stands and races past mr. hayatsu out into the rain. hayatsu takes pursuit, calling after him.}
<C>__{hayatsu}
<D>__{mr. takayama!? mr. takayama...}
<A>__{asakawa, left alone, stares down at the tatami mats.}
