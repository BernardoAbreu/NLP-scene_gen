<A>__{she starts walking again. faster now. looking around trees and porches, anywhere a nine year old boy might hide. she hears children playing. laughing. she picks up her pace, homing in on the sound. she turns the corner to find three children playing, none of them walter. she looks down the ominously empty streets. her worry growing, she heads to the house. faster now. heels clicking on the hard sidewalk.}
