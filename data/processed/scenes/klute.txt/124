<L>__{interior elevator}
<A>__{klute and custodian as elevator ascends; looking up the elevator shaft through the open cage we see a series of doors hanging over space seeming to lead nowhere. the whole sequence has the feeling of a dream of being lost in a black limbo. klute and custodian leave elevator on higher floor and walk down the long very low corridor past rows of locked vault doors. the custodian stops at one and opens it. we are in a small dungeon like room filled with banks of files from floor to ceiling. the custodian counts to himself }
<C>__{custodian}
<D>__{four five what number'd i say?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{four ninety seven, jane mckenna}
<A>__{custodian finds it, unlocks for klute's inspection. reaches for paper klute's holding.}
<C>__{custodian}
<D>__{ and i keep the authorization, please.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{i thought there'd be more.}
<A>__{klute pokes through a small collection of personal effects perhaps an ankle bracelet, rabbits foot, faded snapshot of a child, some letters, pitiful remnants of jane mckenna's life. klute closes the drawer, and the front of the drawer is marked mckenna, jane? over the visual material of klute's trip through the warehouse we hear wild track voice over bits and pieces of bree talking with the psychiatrist.}
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{all right. loneliness.}
<P>__{(space)}
<D>__{well separated. from other people. forgotten.}
<P>__{(space)}
<D>__{well, as if i can be here, i can go through the motions, right? but the truth is, i don't belong.}
<C>__{spangler }
<P>__{(prompts mildly)}
<D>__{don't belong?}
<C>__{bree }
<P>__{(snappishly)}
<D>__{do you always have to repeat?}
<C>__{spangler }
<D>__{sorry.}
<P>__{(then)}
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{well it's more than loneliness. hate. people hating me and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me you know? i'm all screwed up.}
<C>__{spangler }
<D>__{you think people hate you.}
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{the truth is i hate them: they must hate me. all right, the money.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{all right, not the money. a kind of put on. it gets things back together.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{well let's say i'd go to one of these cattle calls, a tryout. i mean before before i got this job and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. they didn't want me.}
<C>__{spangler }
<D>__{didn't want you.}
<C>__{bree }
<P>__{(snaps)}
<D>__{i said that.}
<P>__{(resumes)}
<D>__{well, so you have a choice. you can either feel lonely you know, the hate or }
<P>__{(then more rapidly, plunging)}
<D>__{so you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some john you've never seen before, but he wants you. he must, he's paying for it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. and then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and it's not real and you don't have to even like them you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe you know?}
