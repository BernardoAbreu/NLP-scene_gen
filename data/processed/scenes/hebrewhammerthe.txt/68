<L>__{interior the hammer's pad night}
<A>__{a smooth, laid back blaxploitation era song pumps from the speakers. we do a slow pan from the stereo into a tight shot of esther and the hammer slow dancing. sexy. esther grunts and moans a bit. we begin a slow zoom back from the two, eventually pulling back far enough to see what esther's moaning about. the hammer is a seriously terrible dancer, stepping on her toes, forcing her into awkward positions, etc. we see a cu of the hammer accidentally stepping on her toes yet again.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{ouch!}
<A>__{esther pulls herself away from the hammer.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{sorry. i'm better with men.}
<C>__{esther}
<P>__{(sensually)}
<D>__{maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{you mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...oh. i get it.}
<A>__{we see a tight medium shot of esther. her erect nipples are clearly outlined through her blouse. now, the hammer's really getting it.}
<C>__{hammer }
<D>__{now we're talking boobola.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{mordechai?}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{yes esther.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{i want you to talk dirty to me.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{oh. okay.}
<A>__{he thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{hammer }
<D>__{i want to have lots of children by you. get a good paying, stable job. settle down in long island somewhere. someplace nice. fancy. but not fancy schmancy.}
<A>__{she's warming up.}
<C>__{hammer }
<D>__{i want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. little abraham will go to stanford for college, batya will go ivy league, maybe vassar.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{keep going.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in israel. because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.}
<A>__{she's on fire for him.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{oh god, yes! keep going! don't stop!}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{also, on a daily basis, i want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how i should live my life.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{kiss me you semitic stud!}
<A>__{she grabs him and kisses him passionately.}
<C>__{esther }
<P>__{(playfully)}
<D>__{hmm. i feel something poking around down there. maybe i should investigate. what do you think about that mr. certified circumcised dick?}
<A>__{she begins to unzip his pants. we cut to a shot of an excited mordechai as we hear the sound of the unzipping of his pants reach its conclusion. a cu on her as she looks down at his jewish manhood. a wide eyed, almost shocked reaction. she slowly looks back to him and smiles slyly.}
<C>__{esther }
<D>__{shabat shalom!}
<A>__{as the two embrace, we rack focus from the two of them in the bg to the hanukkah candles burning brightly on the menorah in the fg. we blur out of focus.}
