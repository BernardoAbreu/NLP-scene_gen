<L>__{interior board of regents hearing room day}
<A>__{the seven members of the board of regents sit on one side of a long rectangular table, the chairman in the middle. on the other side are coach winters, bobby collins, the president of the faculty senate, edward learnihan, academic advisor, arthur shane, president of the student body, richard fowler, and galen howard. fowler is addressing the board.}
<C>__{fowler}
<D>__{therefore, i respectfully submit that bobby collins should not be given special treatment just because he's a football player. would a regular student get a reinstatement hearing if they'de been caught cheating? nobody's talking about letting the girl who took the test back in.}
<A>__{winters could kill this kid.}
<C>__{learnihan}
<D>__{i think it's also instructive to look at some of the courses this young man has taken. beginning golf, voice and speech improvement...}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i'd like to point out that mr. collins was still on schedule to get his degree.}
<C>__{learnihan}
<P>__{(pointing to collin's transcript)}
<D>__{in what, swimming pool management?}
<C>__{chairman}
<D>__{would you like to respond, coach winters?}
<A>__{winters rises, sweating, less from nervousness than from the odious nature of what he has to do.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{i don't know much about all this other stuff, but i do know the punishment should fit the crime. cheating's bad, but i don't think it deserves a life sentence. here's one of those athletes who takes college level courses, who wants to graduate. i think bobby collins made a big mistake, but he's already been suspended for several weeks. he's served his time. i think he deserves a second chance.}
<C>__{learnihan}
<D>__{like alvin mack? we gave him a second chance and since he's had 5 incompletes, 4 withdrawals and still reads at a fourth grade level. you're using his body to make money for the athletic department you, yourself, are making three times what the chancellor is but obviously no one is making an effort to see that this kid gets an education.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{he's helpin' to pay for your physics lab too. if you're willin' to go without a new office, maybe i could hold him out a few games. save his body.}
<C>__{chairman}
<D>__{gentlemen...}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{alvin was way behind in school when he got here. you can't make up for, in four years, what it took 18 to create.}
<C>__{learnihan}
<D>__{then he should never have been admitted in the first place. it's not fair to other students who worked hard to get here.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{is it fair to exclude kids who come from inferior schools? you hold everybody to the same standards, you're discriminating against the poor kids.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{most of my players are farm boys, inner city kids. football is their deliverance.}
<C>__{learnihan}
<D>__{deliverance from what? a valid education?}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{you throw bobby collins and alvin out, you take away their futures. in alvin's case you probably cost him a couple million dollars in the pros.}
<C>__{learnihan}
<D>__{but this is not a football vocational school. it's an institute of higher learning.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{yeh, but when was the last time 80,000 people showed up to watch a kid do a chemistry experiment?}
<C>__{chairman}
<D>__{gentlemen, please, let's get back to the business at hand, bobby collins. as you know, i played football here. and i remember how hard it was to practice and then study when you're dead tired. so i have some sympathy for this young man. but i never cheated, so the real question is his character. since you know him better than anyone else in this room; and having talked to him and observed him over the last several weeks, do you feel he's learned his lesson? in other words, can you vouch for his character?}
<A>__{winters would rather cut off his own head with a razor blade.}
<C>__{winters}
<P>__{(it's killing him)}
<D>__{yes, sir, i can.}
<A>__{bobby collins breaks into a wide, triumphant smile.}
