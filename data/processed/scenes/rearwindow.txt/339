<A>__{lisa approaches the door of thorwald's apartment. the salesman comes into the living room. he finds a package of cigarettes, extracts one, and lights it. lisa kneels down, and carefully slides the letter under the door. at this moment, thorwald extinguishes the match, tosses it into an ashtray, and turns toward the door. he freezes as he sees the letter on the floor. this momentary hesitation allows lisa to straighten up, turn, and walk carefully but swiftly, away. thorwald moves rapidly toward the door. he bends down, scoops up the letter, and examines it briefly. lisa is just turning out of sight at the end of the corridor, as thorwald throws open the door. he looks and sees no one. he takes a few questioning steps down the corridor, then stops to examine the letter again. slowly he turns and makes his way back to the apartment, tearing open the envelope.}
