<A>__{as two m.p.'s escort raymond dunbar (the "bigger man") into}
<L>__{interior coffee room morning}
<A>__{a small cluttered room with the shades drawn. a folding table has been set up in the middle of it with a chair on each side. dunbar takes a seat in the far chair. takes in his surroundings as the mp's leave, locking the door.}
<L>__{interior fort mckinley corridor morning}
<A>__{hardy and osborne head towards the coffee room.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{i questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. you don't have a badge, he won't talk to you. hardy, ten bucks says i have him talking in under three minutes.}
<A>__{osborne starts the timer on her digital watch.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{go.}
<L>__{interior coffee room morning}
<A>__{dunbar looks up as they enter. hardy smiles, cheerily.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{cadet dunbar, good morning! i'm tom hardy and i believe you've already met officer osborne. i understand you had a rough time of it last night?}
<A>__{no response. hardy takes a seat across from the cadet.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{not talking, huh? you probably just want to get some food and some sleep. they feed you yet?}
<A>__{no response. hardy reaches into his pocket. pulls out a}
<B>__{donut.}
<A>__{dunbar eyes it, wary but definitely wanting it.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{go on. you can eat in front of someone and still not talk to them my parents did it for years.}
<A>__{dunbar grabs the donut, wolfing it down.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{want another one?}
<A>__{no response. osborne looks to her watch it's been a minute.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{maybe later. ray, let me say this up front i'm not a cop.}
<A>__{dunbar turns away, no longer interested. hardy continues:}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i used to be, but that's beside the pointerior who i am doesn't really matter; what matters is that right now, you're in a shitload of trouble. you understand that, right?}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{now, i don't know if you did what you did in self defense and frankly i don't really care. i'm just doing a favor for colonel styles because he wants to know if anyone else who's still out there is in need of assistance. to be honest with you, though, i don't care about that either.}
<A>__{dunbar looks up at this, surprised.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i don't know those guys, you do. they die, to me, it's like seeing a couple people died in a fire on the news tragic, but it doesn't affect me. the only thing i care about is i agreed to do a favor for a friend and try and talk to you till your transpo shows up. you like baseball?}
<A>__{no response. osborne looks at her watch two minutes.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i could talk baseball for days. batting averages, era's, i got statistics in my brain, i don't know how i remember them. it's freaky. you wanna talk baseball?}
<A>__{dunbar, completely confused.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{come on ray, we're gonna be here five hours, we gotta talk about something. so who do you like?}
<A>__{a long silence and then:}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i don't like baseball.}
<A>__{hardy grins as osborne stops her watch at 2:41.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i asked for a policeman.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{you're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. what's wrong with baseball?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{it's... too slow.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i just don't like it.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{what do you like then?}
<A>__{as they continue, we track under the table to reveal a hidden}
<B>__{microphone...}
