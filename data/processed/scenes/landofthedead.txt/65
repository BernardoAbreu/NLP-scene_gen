<A>__{a long dock juts into the river. dead reckoning stops beside it. mouse jumps out. cholo stands in an open hatch.}

<C>__{cholo}
<D>__{at midnight. give me a call. let e know if we're rich or not.}
<A>__{mouse nods, running off to hide in a boat shed.}
<L>__{exterior depot night}
<A>__{the steel doors to the subway tunnel open. riley and his team step out. the depot has been devastated. fires burning. fences down. only tony baloney moves, still waving spookily.}
<C>__{c}
<C>__{harlie}
<D>__{geez. cholo made a mess.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{cholo didn't do all this.}
<A>__{clouds of thick black smoke from the fires billow across the depot, restricting visibility. ever shifting openings in the clouds reveal glimpses of torn body parts.}
<C>__{riley }
<D>__{stenches have been at this place.}
<A>__{he leads the way into the depot, his m 16 at the ready. behind him, all eyes peer nervously into the smoke. everyone speaks in hushed tones.}
<C>__{manolete}
<D>__{when the truck pulled out, it must have knocked the fence down. that's how they got in.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{that fencing was pushed in from outside.}
<C>__{teahouse}
<D>__{you know how many stenches it would take to do that?}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{there's a thousand of them out there for every one of us.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{good thing we're smarter.}
<C>__{slack}
<D>__{look who's talkin'.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{they're getting smart. i saw it in uniontown, last time out. they're learning how to work together.}
<A>__{thoughts darken. so does the smoke, which billows thicker, virtually blinding the team. sounds come. the moaning of the wind. the popping of burnt metal and wood.}
<C>__{teahouse}
<D>__{what do they want?}
<A>__{slack looks back as she walks. the zombies have taken down another section of the depot fence, beyond which lies a suburb. beyond which is the river. beyond which is the glow of the fiddler's green high rise.}
<C>__{slack}
<D>__{they want the city.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{the city is us. they're after us. we pissed `em off one too many times.}
<C>__{manolete}
<D>__{they'll never get across the river.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{thank heaven.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{gotta love the guy. he still believes in heaven. anyone got a radio?}
<A>__{teahouse pulls a motorola from his belt. just as he tosses it to riley, they hear...growling! he team draws their weapons, standing in a loose circle, their backs to each other, guns searching for a target. darting eyes peer into the void. more noises emanate from somewhere. everywhere. slowly... ...charlie unstraps his remington. licks his thumb. wets the sight of the rifle.}
<C>__{lack}
<P>__{(a whisper) why do you do that?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(whispering back) catches the}
<D>__{light. right now it's moonlight. lets me see where i'm aimin'.}
<A>__{blam! charlie fires! a single shot into the black smoke.}
<C>__{slack}
<D>__{the hell you shooting at?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that thing.}
<B>__{a}
<A>__{dead man steps out of the smoke! before anyone can react, it grabs slack's shoulder from behind! she whirls around. pulls away. is about to shoot when she sees an entry wound on the left side of the thing's forehead.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{ff center. but i got him.}
<A>__{the thing relaxes its grip and drops at slack's feet.}
<C>__{anolete}
<P>__{(hysterical) there's more of `em out}
<D>__{there. i can hear `em. there's more!}
<A>__{there are shuffling sounds in the smoke. manolete backs away. pillsbury grabs him. slaps him, hard, across the face.}
<C>__{pillsbury}
<D>__{if they is more, we gonna need o guns. pull `em out n'stann up wid us, like de man you ain't.}
