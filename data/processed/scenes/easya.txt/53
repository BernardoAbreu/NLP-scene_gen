<L>__{interior olive's bedroom day}
<A>__{olive lays on her bed watching the scene from `can't buy me love' that she just performed. she eats a candy bar and wallows in her self pity.}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(to the television)}
<D>__{oh, cindy mancini. it could have been a lot worse. trust me.}
<A>__{her mom comes in with a nicely wrapped gift.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{that kid from the other night just dropped this off for you.}
<A>__{indicating an empty space on the floor }
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{put it on the pile of gifts from my other suitors.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{he seems like a nice boy... gay...}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{a dyed in the wool homosexual that boy is.}
<A>__{rosemary puts the gift on the floor.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{i dated a homosexual in high school.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{we're not dating, mom.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{i just wanted to tell you that if you want to date a gay boy, it might be hard on your father and i, at first. but we love you no matter what the sexual orientation of your opposite sex partner.}
<A>__{rosemary leaves, chuckling at her own joke. too curious, olive opens the gift. she withdraws a photo of the bully holding brandon's legs while he does a keg stand. she smiles, pleasantly. she pulls out a pink vibrator and looks at it quizically. there's an envelope inside. she opens it and pulls out a $200 gift card to target.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{cindy mancini gets $1,000. i get a vibrator and a $200 gift card to target.}
<A>__{there's a note, which she reads aloud to herself.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{dear olive, the dildo is just in case you don't shop at target. then you can fuck yourself.}
<A>__{olive breaks out into riotous laughter. she's genuinely touched by this gift. the phone rings. thinking it's brandon, olive snatches it up.}
<C>__{olive }
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{your package was perfection!}
<C>__{rhiannon }
<D>__{so, it's true!}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{rhi?}
<C>__{rhiannon }
<D>__{well, it's not last night's conquest!}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{you know, i always think it's so ridiculous on tv, when someone picks up the phone and magically seems to know who's going to be on the other end. i usually preface a conversation with `hello' to avoid such banalities. the one time i decide to step outside this convention... how are you?}
