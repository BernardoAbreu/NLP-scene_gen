<L>__{interior nomad hotel and casino security room day}
<A>__{s.a. gerald diego, alias pasquale acosta, speaking with "bill" security supervisor for the nomad. banks of video monitors surround them, displaying the various gaming areas and vip floors...two of the screens are completely blacked out.}
<C>__{acosta}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{can i speak to you privately?}
<A>__{the supervisor nods, dismisses his staff, calls after one.}
<C>__{security supervisor}
<D>__{gary, let's get our personnel up in the catwalk over twelve, that stickman has been acting odd and i don't like the rolls that table has been getting.}
<C>__{employee}
<D>__{got it.}
<A>__{acosta waits for the door to close, leaving only himself and the supervisor in the room.}
<C>__{acosta}
<D>__{it's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.}
<C>__{security supervisor}
<D>__{and everybody, all the time. yeah, it's a chore.}
<A>__{acosta laughs, keeps it loose.}
<C>__{acosta}
<D>__{so, bill, if i understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?}
<C>__{security supervisor}
<D>__{that's correct.}
<C>__{acosta}
<P>__{(points to monitors)}
<D>__{but with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?}
<C>__{security supervisor}
<D>__{well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so }
<C>__{acosta}
<D>__{ so you shut them off?}
<A>__{the supervisor, quick to amend.}
<C>__{security supervisor}
<D>__{yes, but no we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty four hours a day.}
<C>__{acosta}
<D>__{what kind of personnel?}
