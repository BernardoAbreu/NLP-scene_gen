<A>__{joe takes the stairs two at a time to burst in on...}
<L>__{interior x flat day}
<A>__{... ratso huddled in the overstuffed chair wearing the stolen sheepskin coat wrapped in blankets, his teeth chattering, in spite of the sweat on his forehead. joe stops abruptly, his mood shattered by ratso's alarming condition. they simply stare at each other for a moment, then joe turns away to see soup heating on the sterno stove. joe tosses one of his paper bags onto ratso's lap...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{see what you think of that crap. i will pour your soup. got some of that junk you like to swill, too. mentholatum. aspirin. all that shee it...}
<A>__{ratso opens the paper bag, trying to control his shivering, pulling out the socks and a suit of long underwear. he sees joe watching him for a reaction. the best ratso can do is a slight shake of his head.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{they wrong?}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{no. but while you was buying the underwear, i could have lifted the socks.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. can you hold this?}
<A>__{joe hands ratso the soup. ratso seems steadied by the warmth in his hands. he nods, sipping the soup.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{but thanks.}
<P>__{(hesitates, then)}
<D>__{hey, joe, don't get sore about this or anything. you promise?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{well, i don't think i can walk.}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{i mean, i been falling down a lot and, uh...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{and what?}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{i'm scared.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what of?}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{what'll happen. i mean what they do to, you know, do with you if you can't ah, christ!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{i don't know. cops. or the how should i know?}
<A>__{ratso is trembling so violently that the sou, starts to slop over. joe takes it and sets it on the table.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{okay. here it is. you gonna go see the doctor. i got nine bucks and twenty more thursday and i gonna be riding high before you know it. so you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{no doctors. no, sir. not me. doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. fix one thing, unplug another. operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. my old man, for god's sake, wasn't any sicker'n i am when he went to the doctor.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? die on me?}

<D>__{i will find the money. if you just get me on the bus, that's all i ask.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{i don't even want you to go. whaddya think of that? i got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's god's gift to women. one twenty buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in new york city. it's laughable.}
<A>__{joe sets his stetson on his head.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{when i put you on that bus down to florida tonight, that'll be the happiest day of my life!}
