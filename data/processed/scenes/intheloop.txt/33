<L>__{interior state department. linton's office day}
<A>__{looking over at karen. now alone, who is still stealing glances over.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{i do not understand why anyone would choose to work in a glass office. in my opinion glass offices are for perverts.}
<C>__{bob adriano}
<D>__{i could request the glass be frosted?}
<C>__{linton}
<P>__{(as if bob adriano brought it up)}
<D>__{frosting is for cakes, bob. now. what happened in london?}
<C>__{bob adriano}
<D>__{generally positive. two glitches. karen flagged a report by one of her staffers liza. she's obviously trying to use it as some kind of roadblock. it's called pwip pip.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{pip what?}
<C>__{bob adriano}
<D>__{pwip pip.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{what is that a report on birdcalls? what does that stand for?}
<C>__{bob adriano}
<D>__{i don't recall. it's factish. intel case for and against intervention.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{we've got all the facts we need on this. in the land of truth, my friend, the man with one fact is king. you said there was another thing?}
<C>__{bob adriano}
<D>__{in the meeting with the foreign office the committee was accidentally briefly alluded to.}
<C>__{linton}
<P>__{(putting his hand over his}
<D>__{mouth so he can't be lip }
<P>__{read)}
<D>__{which committee?}
<C>__{bob adriano}
<P>__{(doing the same)}
<D>__{the war committee.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{karen must not find out about that. she is an excitable yapping she dog. okay get the minutes of the meeting, we need to correct the record.}
<C>__{bob adriano}
<D>__{we can do that?}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{yes we can. they're an aide memoir for us. so they should not be a reductive record of what happened to be said, but a more full record of what was intended to be said. i think that's the more accurate version, right?}
<A>__{later. bob adriano is going through the minutes with linton.}
<C>__{linton }
<D>__{i don't like this section. cut that. i don't think this is really what france are saying. let's change that. and these. and let's reverse this.}
<C>__{bob adriano}
<D>__{that's something karen said.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{it's not right. change it.}
<C>__{bob adriano}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{and i like this.}
<C>__{bob adriano}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{let's say everyone agreed with this.}
<C>__{bob adriano}
<D>__{excellent.}
