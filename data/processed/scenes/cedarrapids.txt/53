<D>__{i'm a very bad girl. but i swear i only smoke in cedar rapids. care for a virginia slim, lippe?}
<A>__{tim just shakes his head, unable to hide his despondence.}
<C>__{joan }

<L>__{exterior cedar rapids park day (a little while later)}
<A>__{tim and joan swing on a swing set in a dreary little park overlooking the cedar river. it is a cold, gray day.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{he didn't have to yell at me. i didn't do anything wrong. i'm trying my hardest.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{d'you want me to kick his butt?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{could you?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{absolutely. i know krogstad. i could take him. `sides, i'm a ninja. a nin jette, actually. hoo waaaah!}
<P>__{(tim chuckles)}

<P>__{(does 40s style cagney)}
<D>__{look here, see, how'd you end up in the insurance game, see...?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{you are freaky.}
<P>__{(laughs, then)}
<D>__{no, it's kind of weird how i got interested in insurance, actually. when i was six, my dad got killed in a sawmill accident.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{yeah. not good. but after he died, our insurance agent fought like a tiger against the sawmill to make sure me and my mom were taken care of. and we were.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the crazy thing our agent was actually bill krogstad.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no way. really?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{he had just opened northlands. anyway, i remember thinking, this guy's a hero. a real hero. so even if he doesn't always treat me, like y'know... whatever now i will never forget that.}
<A>__{tim jumps off the swing, taking care not to slip in the snow. joan jumps off. they walk toward the river, silent for a bit.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{this river the cedar river? it flooded the whole city a couple years ago.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i remember that. massive disaster.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{people talk about the firemen and policemen and that. but think about all the claims in a disaster like that how hard those agents worked to make sure people's lives weren't left in the lurch. we're talking billions of dollars in damages, literally. and claim by claim, dream by dream, those agents helped rebuild this city. i'm telling you, it's a noble calling. i really believe that.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you realize you just made it sound cool to be an insurance salesman? you are a hero, lippe.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{tss. i wish.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no, i can tell. you're the superman type. kind of dweeby on the surface but a real frickin' stud underneath. they'd call you insurance man put a big red "i" on your chest...}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{well, even if you're being full of it, thanks for saying that anyway.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{well, you're welcome.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{so can you fly me back to the hotel, insurance man? i'm freezing my arse off.}
<A>__{he laughs, sufficiently cheered up. she snaps her fingers and starts heading back.}
