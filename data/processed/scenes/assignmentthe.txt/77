<L>__{interior cafeteria abandoned prison day}
<A>__{it is after lunch and jack and amos are eating ice cream sundaes while ramirez sits eating the last bit of porridge from the huge bowl.}
<C>__{amos}

<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(deadly)}
<D>__{yeah... yeah... i finished all my porridge.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{good now you can have some more.}
<A>__{he motions for the waiter who crosses with a fresh pot and starts to ladle it out into ramirez's bowl. ramirez reaches up and tears at his tie and rips open the top button. ramirez explodes batting the waiter's hand away and sending the bowl flying.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{enough of this porridge shit man, hi jo deputa! fuck it man... i ain't eatin' no more of this shit! and i ain't wearin' this fuckin' shirt anymore either!}
<A>__{with that he rips off the tie and rips open the shirt.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{why miguel amigo, whatever is the matter?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{i will tell you what the matter is man... i been here twelve mother fuckin' weeks an' all i've had to eat the whole time is this shit! and those dumb ass basketball games... what's that?! you damn near kill me with those fucking snowmobiles... i haven't seen my family in three months and i still don't know what any plan is or what i'm supposed to be doing!}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{congratulations! you're acting like a child... like a spoiled brat...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and not a navy lieutenant commander, which is exactly what would get you killed.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{finally you're acting like a willful spoiled child which is just what carlos was.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we couldn't just let you study carlos. if this thing is going to work, you have to become him.}
<A>__{ramirez looks at him in disgust.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{the two most elite intelligence services in the world and the best you can come up with is this porridge bullshit?!}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{as a child carlos was fed that porridge that you love so much every day. he hated it. every woman or man he's ever been close to he told about that porridge... how the very smell of it made him sick. and now it makes you sick.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{when he was in school he was a scrawny little kid. the last one to get picked for any teams. he felt as clumsy as we've made you feel...}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{his father smoked cigars... the same ones whose smell you complained about. the only cover that can save your life... is the one you believe yourself. now... are you ready to pass the next test?}
<A>__{ramirez just looks at them, in a kind of shock.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{i will take that for a yes. you're about to go into your house. your wife has told you she was away with the children for a week. she is entering the house for the first time in a week with you. the children are still at grandma's so the two of you have a nice romantic time ahead of you. walk through the house... through the living room and the kitchen only. you have thirty seconds. walk casually through the house so as not to make her suspicious of anything you do and find out if she's telling you the truth or not. if you pass this test your questions will be answered. if not... you'll be sent home to virginia and this will be the end of it.}
