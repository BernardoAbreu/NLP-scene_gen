<A>__{the lonely sound of a buoy bell in the distance. water slapping against a smooth, flat surface in rhythm. the creaking of wood. off in the very far distance, one can make out the sound of sirens. suddenly, a single match ignites and invades the darkness. it quivers for a moment. a dimly lit hand brings the rest of the pack to the match. a plume of yellow white flame flares and illuminates the battered face of dean keaton, age forty. his salty gray hair is wet and matted. his face drips with water or sweat. a large cut runs the length of his face from the corner of his eye to his chin. it bleeds freely. an un lit cigarette hangs in the corner of his mouth. in the half light we can make out that he is on the deck of a large boat. a yacht, perhaps, or a small freighter. he sits with his back against the front bulkhead of the wheel house. his legs are twisted at odd, almost impossible angles. he looks down. a thin trail of liquid runs past his feet and off into the darkness. keaton lights the cigarette on the burning pack of matches before throwing them into the liquid. the liquid ignites with a poof. the flame runs up the stream, gaining in speed and intensity. it begins to ripple and rumble as it runs down the deck towards the stern.}
