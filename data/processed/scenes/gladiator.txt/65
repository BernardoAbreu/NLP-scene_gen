<L>__{interior proximo's compound cell night}
<A>__{later. maximus and juba again share a cell. it is more comfortable than their cell in morocco, befitting maximus' new status as one of the "stars." a high, barred window on one wall opens to the city. another barred window is directly over them, twenty feet above. maximus pulls himself up to the side window, he looks out. and sees at last... the colosseum. it is a breathtaking sight. monolithic albert speer like columns of light shine up from the colosseum. it seems to illuminate the whole city and the heavens above. maximus drops back to the floor.}
<C>__{juba}
<D>__{do you think it will be much different? here in rome?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{bigger arena. same killing.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{juba}
<D>__{are you scared for tomorrow?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{juba}
<D>__{me too.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{juba}
<D>__{i never though it would be so easy to kill.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{juba}
<D>__{so you're finally home.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{this isn't my home.}
<C>__{juba}
<D>__{for all romans... this is home.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{juba}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{among my people we honor the soil of our home. our ancestors are in that soil. all their dreams live there. i will never see my home again. the soil is dead and no one honors them, so the dreams die.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{perhaps one day you'll return.}
<A>__{juba looks at him.}
<C>__{juba}
<D>__{how can i go back? i am not what i was. when a man kills for no reason, he has lost himself.}
<A>__{a long beat. juba leans his head back and quietly begins to sing. a haunting lament in his native tongue.}
