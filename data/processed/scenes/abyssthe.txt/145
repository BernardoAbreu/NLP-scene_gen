<A>__{bud walks down the corridor from control, slowly... as if carrying a great weight. the air is still thick with smoke. the power off... everything lit by emergency lights. makeshift quarters have been set up in the mess hall, with blankets laid out on the tables, and with folding cots in the storage room across the hall. jammer is still unconscious. coffey and schoenick bring monk in on a stretcher, and set him up on a table. he is conscious but dazed with painkillers, his led splinted.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{did you find wilhite?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he and bud lock eyes. bud bites back on his recriminations, but his gaze blames coffey. he turns away.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{brigman.}
<P>__{(bud turns)}
<D>__{i was under orders. i had no choice.}
<A>__{coffey's manner is subdued, contrite. a marked contrast to his previous brusque arrogance. he's wrestling with his own loss, a sever blow to the tight brotherhood of a seal unit. bud's anger is not dispelled. but he can't address it now. he moves on. past the infirmary, where sonny dawson is rigging a sling over his own broken arm. he cries out in pain, cursing at himself. looking down the central well as bud crosses. down through the grill decking we can see the bottom level of the module is flooded. catfish is down there welding, sending shivering reflections through the chamber.}
