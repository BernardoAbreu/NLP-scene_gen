<A>__{clarice and officer murray, a young patrolman, ride up in an old fashioned, creaking, metal cage elevator. he is excited.}
<C>__{murray}
<D>__{every cop in tennessee wants a look at this guy. 'sit true what they're sayin' he's some kinda vampire?}

<A>__{pembry, at a desk by the door, looks up from examining the unrolled pile of dr. lecter's drawings.}
<C>__{pembry}
<D>__{you know the rules, ma'am?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{yes, officer pembry. i've questioned him before.}
<A>__{he waves her on her way, but retains the drawings for now. moving angle with clarice as she crosses the big, spare, white octagonal room. a massive, temporary iron cage has been installed; officer boyle sits facing its barred door. he rises, nods, moving away to allow her privacy.}
<B>__{inside the cage}
<A>__{a cot and a small table, each bolted to the floor, and a flimsy paper screen, hiding a toilet. dr. lecter sits at the table, his back to her, studying the buffalo bill case file. he now wears a green prison jumpsuit. a small cassette player is chained to the steel table.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<P>__{(without turning)}
<D>__{good afternoon, clarice.}
<A>__{she stops at a striped police barricade, before his bars.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i thought you might want your drawings back... just until you get your view.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{how very thoughtful... or did crawford send you here for one last wheedle before you're both booted off the case?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{nobody sent me. i came on my own.}
<A>__{he spins in his swivel chair, stops neatly. a coy smile.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{people will say we're in love.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{pity you tried to fool me, isn't it? pity for poor catherine. tick tock...}
<A>__{he spins again in his chair, playfully. moving angle favoring clarice as she circles the cage, trying to keep his face in sight.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{dr. lecter, you find out everything. you couldn't have talked with this "william rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... you made him up, didn't you?}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i think you were telling me the truth in baltimore or starting to. tell me the rest now.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{i've studied the case file, have you...? everything you need to find him is right in these pages. whatever his name is.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{then tell me how.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{first principles, clarice. simplicity. read marcus aurelius. of each particular thing, ask: what is it, in itself, what is its nature...? what does he do, this man you seek?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{he kills w }
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<P>__{(sharply, as he stops)}
<D>__{no! that's incidental.}
<A>__{close angle two shot as he rises, pained by her ignorance, and crosses to the bars.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{what is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{anger, social resentment, sexual frus }
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{no, he covets. that's his nature. and how do we begin to covet, clarice? do we seek out things to covet? make an effort to answer.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{no. we just }
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{no. precisely. we begin by coveting what we see every day. don't you feel eyes moving over your body, clarice? i hardly see how you couldn't. and don't your eyes move over the things you want?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{all right, then tell me how }
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{no. it's your turn to tell me, clarice. you don't have any more vacations to sell, on anthrax island. why did you run away from that ranch?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{dr. lecter, when there's time i will }
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{we don't reckon time the same way, clarice. this is all the time you'll ever have.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{later, listen, i will }
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{i will listen now. after your father's murder, you were orphaned. you were ten years old. you went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in montana. and ?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{and one morning i just ran away...}
<A>__{she turns from him. he presses closer, gripping the bars.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{not "just," clarice. what set you off? you started what time?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{early. still dark.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{then something woke you. what? did you dream...? what was it?}
<B>__{in flashback}
<A>__{the 10 year old clarice sits up abruptly in her bed, frightened. she is in a montana ranch house; it almost dawn. strange, fearful shadows on her ceiling and walls... a window, partly fogged by the cold; eerie brightness outside.}
<C>__{clarice }
<D>__{i heard a strange sound...}
<C>__{dr. lecter }
<D>__{what was it?}
<B>__{the child rises}
<A>__{crosses to the window in her nightgown, rubs the glass.}
<C>__{clarice }
<D>__{i didn't know. i went to look...}
<A>__{high angles (2nd story) the child's pov shadowy men, ranch hands, are moving in and out of a nearby barn, carrying mysterious bundles. the mens' breath is steaming... a refrigerated truck idles nearby, its engine adding more steam. a strange, almost surrealistic scene...}
<C>__{clarice }
<D>__{screaming! some kind of screaming. like a child's voice...}
<B>__{the little girl}
<A>__{is terrified; she covers her ears.}
<C>__{dr. lecter }
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{clarice }
<D>__{got dressed without turning on the light. i went downstairs... outside...}
<B>__{the little girl}
<A>__{in her winter coat, slips noiselessly towards the open barn door. she ducks into the shadows to avoid a ranch hand, who passes her with a squirming bundle of some kind. he goes into the barn, and she edges after him reluctantly.}
<C>__{clarice }
<D>__{i crept up to the barn... i was so scared to look inside but i had to...}
<A>__{the little girl's pov as the open doorway looms closer... bright lights inside, straw bales, the edges of stalls, then moving figures...}
<C>__{dr. lecter }
<D>__{and what did you see, clarice?}
<B>__{a squirming lamb}
<A>__{is held down on a table by two ranch hands.}
<C>__{clarice }
<D>__{lambs. the lambs were screaming...}
<A>__{a third cowboy stretches out the lamb's neck, raises a bloody knife. just as he's about to slice its throat }
<B>__{back to the adult clarice}
<A>__{staring into the distance, shaken, still trembling from the child's shock. we see dr. lecter, over her shoulder, studying her intently.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{they were slaughtering the spring lambs?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{yes...! they were screaming.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{so you ran away...}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{no. first i tried to free them... i opened the gate of their pen but they wouldn't run. they just stood there, confused. they wouldn't run...}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{but you could. you did.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i took one lamb. and i ran away, as fast as i could...}
<B>__{in flashback}
<A>__{a vast montana plain, and crossing this, a tiny figure the little clarice, holding a lamb in her arms.}
<C>__{dr. lecter }
<D>__{where were you going?}
<C>__{clarice }
<D>__{i don't know. i had no food or water. it was very cold. i thought if i can even save just one... but he got so heavy. so heavy...}
<A>__{the tiny figure stops, and after a few moments sinks to the ground, hunched over in dispair.}
<C>__{clarice }
<D>__{i didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. the rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the lutheran orphanage in bozeman. i never saw the ranch again...}
<C>__{dr. lecter }
<D>__{but what became of your lamb?}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{clarice...?}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{as the adult clarice turns, staring into his feverish eyes. she shakes her head, unwilling or unable to say more.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{you still wake up sometimes, don't you? wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{do you think if you saved catherine, you could make them stop...? do you think, if catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? do you...?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{yes! i don't know...! i don't know.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<P>__{(a pause; then, oddly at peace)}
<D>__{thank you, clarice.}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{tell me his name, dr. lecter.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{dr. chilton... i believe you know each other?}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{as clarice turns, startled, and the fuming chilton seizes her elbow. pembry and boyle are beside him, looking grim.}
<C>__{chilton}
<D>__{out. let's go.}
<C>__{pembry}
<D>__{sorry, ma'a m we've got orders to have you put on a place.}
<A>__{clarice struggles, pulling free of them for a moment.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{brave clarice. will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(moving closer to the bars)}
<D>__{yes. i will tell you.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{promise...?}
<P>__{(she nods. he smiles)}
<D>__{then why not take your case file? i won't be needing it anymore.}
<A>__{he holds out the file, arm extended between the bars. she hesitates, then reaches to take it. very close angle slow motion as the exchange is made, his index finger touches her hand, and lingers there, just for a moment. dr. lecter's eyes widen, crackling at this touch, like sparks in a cave.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{good bye, clarice.}
<B>__{clarice}
<A>__{hugging the case file to her chest, stares back at him as the men crowd in on her, pushing her away. her pov moving as dr. lecter, head cocked in a smile, slowly recedes...}
