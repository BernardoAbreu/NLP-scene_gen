<A>__{he flies through it, firing, hitting the terrorist twice.}
<B>__{an explosion}
<A>__{much like the first one on bus 99. hub throws himself over several screaming children. and for a moment we don't know if they'll live or die, until: blue paint covers them all. agents pour in, followed by sharon. there, on the floor, holding as many weeping children as he can:}
<B>__{hub}
<A>__{who, unable to keep up the facade for a single second more, is also weeping now. weeping for the victims of the bombings, weeping for the children who've survived, weeping for himself. and for a moment, everyone just... stands there, vaguely embarrassed, and more than a little moved.}
