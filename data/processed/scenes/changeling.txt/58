<L>__{interior collins home day}
<A>__{christine is cooking dinner when the doorbell rings. she opens the door to find a police officer and dr. earl w. tarr, sixties, mildly eccentric in appearance.}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{mrs. collins? dr. earl w. tarr. captain jones sent me. i consult with him from time to time on juvenile cases. may i come in?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{oh...yes, of course.}
<A>__{she steps aside, and dr. tarr enters, looking around.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{thank you for coming. i'm surprised captain jones moved so quickly. i was starting to think he didn't believe me.}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{well, i'm here now, and we'll put all that to rights. where is the boy?}
<A>__{he looks up as "walter" comes downstairs. noting that he said "the boy," not "your son," christine looks relieved.}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{ah! there he is. a handsome young man. he has your eyes, doesn't he? and a little bit of the nose. very fit, in spite of all his travails. a very resilient boy you've got here, mrs. collins.}
<A>__{as he bends down to look more closely at "walter," christine stiffens...she can't have heard that right.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{doctor tarr, i thought you were here to help me.}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{i am. captain jones said the boy had gone through some extreme physical changes, and asked me to look in on him...to reassure you in this your time of motherly concern.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{my "motherly concern" isn't for him because he's not my son.}
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{statements like that will hardly help the boy's self esteem, now will they?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{captain jones said something about a change in height...?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{he's four inches shorter than }
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{ah, well...hardly a mystery, mrs. collins. we've known for some time that trauma can affect the growth of children. given the stress of the last four months his spine may have actually shrunk. it's uncommon, but within the realm of possibility.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{what about the circumcision?}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{very likely his abductor thought it appropriate. after all, circumcision is hygienically sound. must have been quite traumatic at the time. no wonder he's submerged the memory.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{look, doctor }
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{as you can see, there's a perfectly sound medical explanation for all of this. but it's good for you to raise these questions. you should be apprised of all changes the lad went through during his absence.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{wouldn't i know whether or not he was my son? i'm his mother.}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{which means you're in no position to be objective. you are looking through the prism of extreme emotion at a boy who has changed from what you remember. he isn't the same boy that left here, just as a boy who goes off to war and returns isn't the same anymore.}
<P>__{(more)}
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{dr. tarr }
<D>__{a mother's heart, driven by intuition and emotion rather than logic, sees these changes and rebels, insists that this cannot be your son. but that doesn't change the facts.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm willing to put my theory to the test of objectivity, mrs. collins... are you?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{what're you }
<A>__{before she can react, he takes walter by the hand and leads him outside. christine follows them out to }
