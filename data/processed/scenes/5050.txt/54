<A>__{edith, art and adam enter into the 600 seat synagogue. the service led by rabbi jacobs (75) has already begun. edith spots three empty seats all the way in the left corner of the first row. prime seats, but a bitch to get to since the service has begun getting there would mean wading through a row of two dozen people. the usher approaches.}
<C>__{usher}
<D>__{please take your seats.}
<A>__{the usher motions for edith and company to sit in the back.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{what about those seats up there in the front?}
<C>__{usher}
<D>__{the service has begun.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{please. my son has cancer.}
<A>__{adam's jaw tightens, he can't believe his mother just did that. the usher looks at adam, sizing up the situation. adam couldn't be more uncomfortable.}
<C>__{usher}
<D>__{please, follow me.}
<A>__{the usher leads the group to the front and directs the people in the front row to let them pass through. edith apologizes as each person they pass has to stand to let them by.}
<C>__{edith}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{sorry, my son has cancer.}
<A>__{adam smiles in embarrassment as he steps past.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{hi. nice to see you.}
