<D>__{and this is for bad little girls who don't know how to have fun.}
<A>__{he begins swishing it around, amy is giggling.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{oops. there....almost got you.}
<A>__{amy is dodging and laughing. alex closes in and seems like he will kiss her, but just starts gumming her neck, tickling her. amy leans back laughing and we see her back hits the volume knob on the amplifier.}
