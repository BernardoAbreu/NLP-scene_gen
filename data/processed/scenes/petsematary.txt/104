<C>__{louis}
<D>__{according to what mr. crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. church will be just the same. well almost the same and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn orinco trucks.}
<A>__{at this rachel tightens up still more in that funny way she's actually angered by louis's reference to catburgers but under the anger we sense she is deeply shocked, as a prudish woman might be shocked by a dirty joke. for rachel, that's just what death is.}
