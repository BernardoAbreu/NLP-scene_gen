<L>__{exterior a house in the hollywood hills night}
<A>__{the view of downtown los angeles from the enormous, ornate house is extraordinary. a small outdoor dinner party is in progress. a magician is entertaining guests. playing cards and coins appear and disappear in his nimble hands.}
<L>__{interior house study night}
<D>__{edward harris stands at the window, impassively looking down}
<A>__{at the party. edward is a handsome, well groomed man of around forty. he looks tired; the kind of fatigue that can't be cured by a night's sleep.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(a murmur)}
<D>__{left pocket.}
<A>__{and indeed, down below, the magician pulls the coin from the left pocket of the incredulous woman's silk blazer. more laughter and applause. the study is in keeping with the rest of the house. luxurious. everything the best. william stuckey, edward's contemporary, is a crafty looking lawyer who is the party host. vance is an investment banker. his assistant jake, is a financial researcher. the other men are investment bankers. they are in dark suits and power ties. on the table are stacks of documents and folders, the name "kross industries" is prominent on many of the folders.}
<C>__{investment banker 1}
<D>__{our banks certainly doesn't want to discourage harris enterprises from investing in california. we think this is a great new venue for you but you've got to understand the mergers and acquisitions market is changing. with the upswing in inflation we have to make these offerings tempting to offset the risk.}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{look, we're talking about hard assets and a straight liquidation. we have over a thousand man hours in this deal.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<P>__{(losing patience)}
<D>__{this is a "no brainer". there's no risk for you. no one has ever lost money backing mr. harris.}
<C>__{investment banker 2}
<D>__{not yet. but ship building is a new endeavor for you...}
<C>__{stuckey}
<P>__{(cuts him off)}
<D>__{come on. you know we're not going to go into ship building. besides, you're the ones with the troubled track record, not us!}
<C>__{investment banker 3}
<D>__{bill, be reasonable. if you're really going to digest kross industries that quickly eighteen should not be such a problem. besides, i don't think there's anywhere else you can go for the money in the time you have.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{it's unacceptable.}
<A>__{edward turns from the window. he hasn't miss a thing. all eyes are on him.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{draymen heux has offered me seventy five in the pool at sixteen and a half. i can secure the other half personally. you have until tomorrow morning to make me a better offer.}
<A>__{the bankers speechlessly stare at him.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{the meeting is over, gentlemen.}
<A>__{he turns away. the bankers look at one another. they rise. silence as they exit. when the door closes. stuckey explodes with laughter.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{hah! did you see the look on their faces?}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{you don't think we pushed too hard?}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{no way! they'll come back. they can't afford not to. edward, that bluff was beautiful.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{maybe i should have made it rhyme.}
<A>__{the others stare at him, uncertain. stuckey laughs. the others follow suit.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(looking at his watch)}
<D>__{well! it's late. we've been at this long enough.}
<A>__{stuckey rises. edward ushers vance and jake toward the door.}

<L>__{exterior a side street in hollywood night}
<A>__{a crumbling old apartment building. dark alley ways, deserted parking lot. the ferrari blink and you miss it motors past the building, looking very out of place on the street. panning up a building facade of lit windows and metal fire escape. one window in particular. a girl stands there in a short kimono, looking down. and then she turns away.}

<A>__{a series of shots to see her dressing.}
<L>__{interior vivian's apartment night}
<A>__{vivian turns and stares at herself in a grainy, cracked bedroom mirror. she is twenty years old and a prostitute. make up applied to give her a hard, older look doesn't quite succeed. she'd be innocently beautiful without it. she is wearing tiny shorts, a tight tube top, thigh high boots. she stares at herself, not really liking what she sees. a moment. she signs, turns off the light and walks out of the bedroom.}
<L>__{interior apartment building hallway night}
<A>__{faded, peeling walls. thread bare, dirty carpet. vivian locks the apartment door behind her and starts down the dim hallway. a door suddenly opens, startling her. an unshaved, enormously pot bellied man in a stained t shirt stares at vivian with pig eyes.}

<D>__{my raincoat's in the back. put it on.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you may feel more comfortable. this is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{you mean they don't have hookers.}

<A>__{she looks up. she stops in her tracks. the lobby is bright and spacious, filled with thick carved wood paneling. even at this hour there is a great deal of activity. men in business suits and women in furs and jewels are passing by. vivian's face quickly conceals the sudden awe she feels at the sight of all this luxury. vivian matter of factly reaches out and takes edward's arm.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{so let's go.}
<A>__{edward guides them across the lobby. they reach the elevators and go inside.}

<L>__{interior hotel penthouse night}
<A>__{as vivian steps into the room she has the sensation of falling off the top of the building. in front of her is a sunken living room with massive windows revealing the sparkling lights of the city below. for the first time, she is speechless. edward closes the door and walks past her down the steps to the living room. edward picks up a phone. vivian checks out the room.}

<A>__{vivian is impressed but she's not going to admit it.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{you kidding? i come here all the time. as a matter of fact they do rent this room by the hour.}
<A>__{edward smiles. he sits down in a comfortable chair and leans back. vivian looks at him.}
<C>__{vivian }
<D>__{well, now that you have me for the night, what are you going to do with me?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{want to know something? i don't quite know. i hadn't planned this.}

<C>__{edward}
<D>__{fair enough.}
<A>__{he rises. takes out his wallet. standing over her, he drops three crisp, new hundred dollar bills in vivian's lap. she picks up the bills, stares at them, trying not to be impressed. she puts the money in her jacket. she realizes edward is standing over her as if waiting. she leans forward, reaches out to unzip his pants. he abruptly turns away.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{let's talk some more first.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{right.}

<D>__{and why do you say that?}
<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(a small smile)}
<D>__{i dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.}
<A>__{edward almost smiles. he sits across from her again.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{i've known a lot of everybody.}
<A>__{a chime goes off to indicate there's someone at the door.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{champagne.}
<A>__{he starts to sit up. vivian motions for him to stay put.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{hey. i might as well make myself useful.}
<A>__{edward sits back down. vivian waltzes up the steps and opens the front door. a waiter comes into the room with a silver cart; on it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl.}

<D>__{where would you like it?}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{where would we like it?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{where would we like it? here'll be fine.}
<A>__{the waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle of the living room. he turns and heads back up the stairs and pauses near vivian, staring. vivian stares back at him.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{what are you looking at?}
<A>__{the waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits. vivian closes the door behind him. vivian marches back down the stairs.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i think he wanted you to tip him.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{tsk. excuse me, i didn't think he had change for a hundred.}
<A>__{edward crosses to the silver stand. vivian watches with interest as he twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket.}
<C>__{vivian }
<D>__{you have a wife? girlfriend?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i have both.}
<A>__{edward lifts the bottle out. he deftly pops the cork on the bottle without losing a drop of champagne.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{where are they? shopping together?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{they should be. they're both good at it.}
<A>__{edward pours the champagne into a single long stemmed glass and hands one to vivian.}

<D>__{it's a very good year.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{oooh, thank god.}
<A>__{edward laughs softly. she sips it. to her surprise, really likes it. edward lifts a lid on a silver bowl to reveal a dozen enormous strawberries.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{try a strawberry.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{jesus, you act like you're seducing some valley girl you picked up in a dance club.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.}
<A>__{a moment. she slowly eats a strawberry. the juice of it stains her lips. her eyes are like smoke as she takes a sensuous sip of champagne, licks away the stain of the strawberry. his eyes haven't left her.}

<A>__{edward stares. his expensive clothes are on the floor, haphazardly dropped everywhere. vivian's clothes, as tattered as they are, are neatly folded and piled on a chair. the incongruity of it touches edward in a sad way. he looks toward the bed. vivian is fast asleep. her heavy makeup has long since been rubbed off. asleep, her wary, smart ass attitude is gone. she looks like a sweet, gentle girl. he stares at her a moment longer. he turns, goes into the living room. vivian opens her eyes. through the open door she sees edward sitting in a living room chair. he is reading contracts.}

<A>__{vivian is looking wide eyed and delighted and yes, more than a bit overwhelmed. she passes store windows... and more store windows... and still more store windows. each display is more beautiful and expensive than the one before. vivian is also aware that she is getting odd looks. from passerby's. two beautiful dressed girls her own age look at her, turn away and giggle. the uniformed guards that stand at attention in front of many of the stores, stare at her suspiciously. feeling more and more uncomfortable, vivian comes to a posh woman's boutique. she hesitates for a moment. she enters.}

<D>__{yes. something... conservative.}
<C>__{saleswoman}

<D>__{i don't think it would fit you.}

<D>__{i don't think we have anything for you here. you're obviously in the wrong place.}
<A>__{vivian is speechless. she turns and stomps toward the door. she stops and spins around staring at the saleswoman. vivian flips her off. she throws the door open and storms outside. the saleswoman calmly strolls back to her counter and returns to her place.}

<A>__{vivian comes out onto the street and stands, lost. she takes a deep breath, trying to control herself. two women, in elegant designer outfits, stroll by, eyeing vivian as if she were a freak. vivian suddenly feels naked. she turns and hurries away.}

<A>__{vivian enters the lobby, upset, nervous and paranoid. she feels an emptiness in her stomach at the sight of all the luxury around her. she hurries toward the elevators. at the front desk, mr. thomas, once again spots her. he crosses the lobby and deftly cuts her off from the elevator.}

<A>__{vivian moves down a marble starircase, through the elegant restaurant toward a far table. her beauty and natural grace draw approving stares. she is like a queen moving through a ballroom. at a secluded table, edward sits in conversation with two men. james kross, in his early 70's, a bulky self made millionaire industrialist. sitting next to him is his son and second in command, david kross, a handsome man in his early thirties. all of them rise as vivian comes to the table. david kross holds out vivian's chair for her. surprised, she nods her thanks. in front of her is an enormous placesetting. she smiles down at the utensils, filled with confidence. waiters have placed a delicate salad down in front of each of them. vivian proudly reaches for her salad fork. but then she sees that kross has picked up the fork closest to his plate and is digging into his salad with that. vivian looks to see what edward will do. he doesn't seem interested in eating yet. neither does david kross. feeling a sudden panic, vivian puts her fork down.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{so young man, i understand you are trying to take over my company.}

<D>__{twenty five percent.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{mr. harris, i built kross enterprises myself. i know every man who ever worked there by his first name. i know their wives... and their children. if your intention is to take over my company and turn it into a glorified real estate deal, think again.}
<A>__{edward, thankfully, now reaches for his salad fork and begins to eat. relieved, vivian picks up hers. they all eat for a moment.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{what do you suggest, mr. kross?}
<A>__{waiters approach, some to clear the salad plates, some to put down the next course. vivian, thinking she's got to finish, quickly stuffs her mouth with the rest of her salad. she is reluctant to let the waiter take her fork.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{what would it take to buy our stock back? name your price.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{to get me in a mood to sell double what i paid. but your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.}

<D>__{no. what i have is a lot of money.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{i know all about you, mr. harris. when you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing. even the pension funds are stripped clean. the last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{what i did with those companies was perfectly legal.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{i don't question the legality of what you do. it's your morality that makes me sick. i will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(angry now)}
<D>__{it is not your company. it's a public company. and i am going to acquire it. either i buy from the other stock holders, or i buy from you.}

<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{we're the exactly the same! kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks that's why no kissing it's too personal. the key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved when i'm with a guy, i'm a robot, i just do it.}

<P>__{(shakes her head "no,"}
<D>__{then continues tying}
<P>__{his tie)}
<D>__{when i was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when i was bad, which was pretty often. i'd stare out the window up there and make believe i was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen. then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times i had that dream did the knight say, "come on baby, i will put you up in a great condo."}
<A>__{she finished his tie.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{vivian, life's not a fairy tale.}
<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(softly; to herself)}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{hey, don't mind me. i'm being stupid.}
<P>__{(more)}
<D>__{i will think about it, okay? it's a real good offer for a whore.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i've never treated you like a whore.}
<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(not mean)}
<D>__{you just did.}
<A>__{the doorbell suddenly rings in the living room.}
<L>__{interior penthouse living room day}
<A>__{edward enters the living room. vivian slowly enters behind him. edward opens the front door. mr. kross slowly enters. he looks very old and tired; so much so that edward has to mask his surprise.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{mr. harris.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{how are you, mr. kross.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights. i will get used to it.}
<A>__{an angry, reluctant looking david kross is behind his father. stuckey brings up the rear. edward and david give one another perfunctory nod. stuckey smugly winks at edward. edward closes the door and leads them all down the stairs. vivian is very troubled at kross's appearance. he gently nods at vivian.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{young lady.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{hello.}
<P>__{(to david)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hello, vivian.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{let's not waste time here, shall we? mr. kross, you said this morning, you wished to speak with mr. harris. mr. harris is now listening.}
<A>__{kross has to fight down his humiliation at stuckey's tone. he turns to edward.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{yes. i'm here to tell you that i've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{expected... offer.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{of course, yes. after the expected filing period is over, i'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{you're making the right decision, sir.}
<A>__{stuckey glances triumphantly at edward. he is surprised to see that there doesn't seem to be any victory in edward's face. edward is silent. kross interprets his silence as second thoughts.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{i will see you on one condition. i'm not so concerned for me but the people who have worked for me...}
<A>__{vivian is disturbed watching this tired looking man.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{they'll be taken care of. won't they, edward?}
<A>__{kross ignores stuckey. he looks to edward. edward slowly nods.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{i will sign anything you want then.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{today.}

<C>__{kross}
<D>__{today.}

<A>__{she hangs up as edward comes in.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{what did you do to him?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{last time i saw him he was this strong guy. now he's beaten. and you liked him.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{vivian, i want you to listen to me. the man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{it's not your concern. it's... business, that's all.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{business.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{yes. the man made a business decision.}
<C>__{vivian}

<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{me?}
<C>__{mr. thomas}
<D>__{i'd send them up, but sadly, i don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.}
<A>__{a hand reaches out and wrenches the phone away from mr. thomas. kit, heavy make up, skimpy outfit, chewing gum, cigarette and all, keeps her voice just below a bellow.}

<P>__{(glaring at mr. thomas)}
<D>__{the sphincter police won't let me through.}

<C>__{kit}

<P>__{(meaning it)}

<D>__{you think i fit here where they just about chew your food for you?}
<C>__{kit}
<D>__{where do you fit?}

<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{i kissed him, kit. on the mouth.}
<C>__{kit}
<D>__{honey, you're not supposed to do that.}
<C>__{vivian}

<P>__{(miserably)}
<D>__{it was great.}

<C>__{kit}
<D>__{go for the bucks.}

<D>__{i don't care about bucks.}

<D>__{i blame myself here. first time i laid eyes on ya', i knew you were too complicated to be a whore.}
<A>__{vivian nods. her face is filled with confusion.}
<L>__{interior brokerage house conference room day}
<A>__{edward stands at the window looking out. there is something about his somber demeanor that both reflects the look we've just seen on vivian and suggests the way we saw him at the top of the story. jake enters, a pile of papers under his arm. he begins laying them out on the conference table.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{congratulations, sir.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{mr. kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. it's finished. you've won.}

<C>__{jake}
<D>__{who are you going after next, sir?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{who indeed...}
<A>__{he turns as stuckey, james and david kross, and vance enter the room. they surround a conference table. kross sits, the papers laid out in front of him. stuckey hands kross a pen. a secretary lays out finger food. they wait for her to leave before they speak.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{if we can get these letters of intent out of the way now... mr. harris and i would like to ask you some questions about your company.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{dad, excuse me, but that's inappropriate. you're under no obligation to answer any questions at all.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{could we at least wait till after the filing period?}
<A>__{stuckey glances to edward for help. edward is silent; indeed it's as if something is twisting inside of him. stuckey plunges ahead.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{mr. harris is preparing a bid based on our speculation of the corporation's net worth. the price he ultimately pays for your father's stock will be based on that bid. the more we know, the higher our bid can be.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{it's in my best interest to cooperate, david.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{if he throws himself on your sword, you promise to take care of him and his family, huh?}
<A>__{david stares at him.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{that's unfair!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you bed it is.}
<P>__{(to edward)}
<D>__{you're everything he said you were.}
<P>__{(to his father)}
<D>__{do what you have to do, dad. just don't expect me to watch it.}
<A>__{he exits. a moment. kross looks at edward with a resigned smile.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{he's young. he hasn't learned how to lose gracefully yet. i will sign your papers. and i will answer your questions. whatever you want.}
<A>__{he sighs. he picks up the pen. he's about to sign.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{stop. for just a moment.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{mr. kross, i'd like to ask you a few questions before you sign. you realize that you're a target. if you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{if you had a... reprieve, what would do?}
<C>__{stuckey}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{i don't think there's any sense in }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{let him answer.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{i... i would take advantage of it.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{kross looks uncertain. he gropes for an answer.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{i... i don't know. there... there wasn't time...}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you? the waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.}
<A>__{surprise suddenly flares in stuckey's eyes.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{oh, my god... edward, no!}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{have you lost your mind?}
<C>__{kross}
<P>__{(to stuckey)}
<D>__{quiet.}
<P>__{(to edward)}
<D>__{would i get the loans?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{this time i imagine you would, yes.}
<P>__{(as if thinking about it)}
<D>__{hmm...}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{with all this in mind, mr. kross, i can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can i?}
<C>__{kross}
<P>__{(a small smile)}
<D>__{you'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, mr. harris.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you're very right. i think the best thing we could all do is go home.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{what!?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{have a good day, gentlemen.}

<A>__{he sets off across century park east.}
<L>__{interior penthouse evening}
<A>__{vivian is in the living room, pacing, edgy, the doorbell rings. she turns. it rings again. she opens it. stuckey is standing outside with a small briefcase. he looks agitated. he tries to hide it.}

<D>__{mind if i have a drink?}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he pours liquor in a glass. he fires it down. it seems to calm him a bit.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{do you want to know what he did? do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did? he handed the whole thing back to kross! on a silver platter. for no reason! what was he thinking, i mean, what was going through his goddam head? why?}
<P>__{(pours another drink)}
<D>__{what was all that benevolent crap? what are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation? i will probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{i think it's great.}
<A>__{stuckey glares at vivian.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{i bet. a lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.}

<D>__{aw, come on, bill. it's just business.}
<A>__{he looks at her a moment.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{but what do i know, maybe you're worth it. come on, show me. let's see your act.}
<A>__{he grabs her wrist.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{get out!}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{don't worry. i will pay for it. what a you charge? huh? twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, maybe? are you a fifty dollar whore?}
<A>__{he tries to kiss her and pulls her down on the couch on top of him.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{are you crazy?}
<A>__{she bites his hand. stuckey slaps her. vivian starts flailing back. but stuckey is too strong. vivian staggers back at the force of another slap. stuckey slams her up against a wall and starts rubbing up against her.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{you got a mean streak in you, don't you.}
<A>__{he tries to kiss her again.}
<C>__{stuckey }
<D>__{is that what he likes about you? huh? answer me!}

<A>__{edward, murder in his eyes, belts stuckey across the room.}
<L>__{interior penthouse night back to scene}
<A>__{stuckey falls on the ground. edward rushes forward, berserk with rage, to hit stuckey again. his fist hits the top of stuckey's head, hurting edward's hand more than stuckey's skull. vivian rushes out of room to bathroom. again stuckey tries to rise. edward kicks him in the butt, sends him headfirst into the bar. glasses and bottles crash to the floor. stuckey again tries to rise. and collapses. edward rubs his fist. they're not used to this violence and both stare at each other panting.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{you broke my nose.}
<C>__{edward}

<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{why do guys always know how to hit a woman? right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode. what do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? it pisses me off!}

<L>__{interior vivian's apartment day}
<A>__{vivian sits on her bed, lost in thought. her bags are packed, ready to go. with a sigh she rises. she picks up the bags, exits the room. vivian stands in the dreary living room, looking at it, taking it all in for the last time. she suddenly looks more than a little bit frightened to be leaving. she musters resolve. she goes to the door, opens it and exits, closing it behind her. silence. vivian suddenly comes back in. she puts down her bags. she crosses to the kitchen where she takes coffee can piggy bank from the shelf. she puts some more bills into it, places it back where kit will find it. she turns and starts again for the door. she stops. she hears something. music. an aria from la boheme. fainterior seemingly coming from nowhere. she dismisses it she's hearing things. she opens the door. stops. the music is louder and getting louder now it's not her imagination. she hurries over to the window.}
<L>__{exterior vivian's apartment building day}
<A>__{vivian comes out onto the fire escape. she stares in wonder. a snow white limo comes up the street. a necktie has been tied to the antennae like a knight's token. the music from la boheme is blaring from the car's stereo. edward is standing on the car's seat, his head and body up through the open sunroof. the wind blows at his hair. he is smiling. everywhere on the street people are staring; the bums, the pushers, the passerby's, the tourists. vivian doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. the car comes to a stop in front of the vivian's building. vivian's landlord comes out the front door. his eyes go wide in disbelief. edward disembarks from the limo by coming up through the sunroof. he leaps nimbly to the ground. he crosses to the entrance of the alleyway, looking up at vivian on the fire escape.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{you are really lost this time.}
<A>__{edward wordlessly holds up a hand for her. with a sudden cry of joy, vivian comes down the fire escape. she stops at the bottom stair. edward comes forward and sweeps her into his arms. they kiss. he carries her to the limo as if she's weightless. her feet never touch the ground. the car door closes behind them. the limo drives away. the people of the street watch it go.}
