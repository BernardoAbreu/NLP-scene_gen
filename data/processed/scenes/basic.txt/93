<L>__{interior kendall's hospital room day}
<A>__{kendall lies in his bed, looking worse than before. hardy and osborne enter.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{pike never confessed.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{we've been making progress, i see.}
<A>__{osborne looks to her watch. kendall notices.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{running out of time, are we? tick tock, tick tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{fifty minutes.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{not much time to solve the crime. tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from guissepe torres? did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{how many murders did you cover up? one? five? maybe an even ten.}
<C>__{hardy}
<P>__{(to osborne)}
<D>__{can i go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?}
<A>__{kendall begins coughing.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{i think they're giving me the wrong medicine. this isn't a very good hospital, you know }
<A>__{hardy sighs and goes to the sink to get him some water.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{epileptic attacks are murder on your system. rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{my heart weeps.}
<A>__{he returns with a glass of water and hands it to kendall.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{pike never confessed.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{no, but it got you interested, didn't it? got you to dig. inspired ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{is it the truth?}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{there's that word again.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{as i told you, i wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{dunbar says you were.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{then he's mistaken. you know, i really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{why did you tell us he shot everybody, levi? you put him in for three murders, the man saved your life }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{so i should stay silent about his misdeeds? the guns went off, i ran in, childs shot me, pike and mueller were dead, and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{dunbar was running out the door? ohhhhhh... see that's where i was confused, because i thought you said nunez was running out the door.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{no. i said dunbar.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{huh. you know, i really thought you said nunez. i thought you said "dunbar was gone," my fault, i gotta check the tape on that.}
<P>__{(off kendall's look)}
<D>__{oh, yeah we taped the last interview. this one too. cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.}
<A>__{silence. they wait for kendall's reaction. he looks momentarily flustered by this... and then he smiles.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{i believe your next line is "what are you trying to hide?"}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{sorry to disappointerior i'm on painkillers for the injury they cloud the mind. you're right, it was nunez. any more questions?}
<A>__{hardy doesn't know what to say. that was his ace card.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{don't get me wrong, mueller and childs were quite the pair, the type of guys you didn't feel comfortable going to sleep around. completely capable of murder. but as i said, i didn't hear the exchange before the shooting. i wasn't in the room.}
<A>__{osborne furrows her brow at this as hardy continues.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{dunbar will testify that you were.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{then we'll leave it up to the courts his word against mine. what does his father do again? steelworker?}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{doesn't matter, i'm sure justice will be served. in any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. he's quite protective.}
<A>__{osborne turns to hardy.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{i need to talk to you outside.}
