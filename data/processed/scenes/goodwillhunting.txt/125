<L>__{interior timmy's tap day}
<A>__{timmy's tap is a local watering hole, not unlike the l street bar. sean is at the bar, telling a joke to timmy (45) the owner of the place, and several other regulars.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{so she goes runnin' up the aisle and i figure "fuck it" and i yell out "don't forget the coffee!}
<A>__{the men erupt in laughter. marty, one of the regulars pipe up.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{bullshit! you didn't say that!}
<A>__{timmy and sean exchange a look.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{jesus christ, marty. it's a joke.}
<A>__{lambeau enters, a bit overdressed in his sport coat and tie.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{gerry! any trouble finding the place?}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{not at all.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{timmy this is gerry, an old friend of mine. we went to college together.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{good to meet you.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{pleasure to meet you.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{could we get a couple of sandwiches?}
<P>__{(beat, smiles)}
<D>__{put it on my tab.}
<A>__{sean heads towards a table.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{you ever plan on payin' your tab?}
<C>__{sean}
<P>__{(pulls out lottery ticket)}
<D>__{i got the winning numbers right here.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{what's the jackpot?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{twelve million.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{i don't think that'll cover it.}
<A>__{lambeau follows [sean]. they sit.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{you're here quite a bit, then.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i live right around the corner.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{you moved?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i been here a couple years.}
<A>__{there is an awkward moment.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{you wanted to talk about will?}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{seems like it's going well.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{well, have you talked to him at all about his future?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{we haven't really gotten into it.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{maybe you should. my phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{jobs doing what?}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{cutting edge mathematics. think tanks. the kind of place where a mind like will's is given free reign.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{that's great, gerry, that there's interest but i'm not sure he's ready for that.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{sean, i really don't think you understand }
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{what don't i understand?}
<A>__{timmy comes over with the sandwiches.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{thanks, timmy.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{excuse me, timmy. could you help us? we're trying to settle a bet.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{uh oh.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{have you heard of jonas salk?}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{yeah, cured polio.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{you've heard of albert einstein?}
<A>__{timmy smiles. gives him a look.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{how about gerald lambeau? ever heard of him?}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{okay thank you, timmy.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{so who won the bet?}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{i did.}
<A>__{a beat. timmy leaves.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{this isn't about me. i'm nothing compared to this young man.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sean, in 1905 there were hundreds of professors who were renowned for their study of the universe. but it was a 26 year old swiss patent clerk, doing physics in his spare time, who changed the world, sean. can you imagine if einstein had given that up? or gotten drunk with his buddies in vienna every night? all of us would have lost something. and i'm quite sure timmy never would have heard of him.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{isn't that a little dramatic, gerry?}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{no, sean. this boy has that gift. he just hasn't got the direction. we can give that to him.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{he married his cousin.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{einstein. had two marriages, both trainwrecks. the guy never saw his kids, one of whom, i think, ended up in an asylum possible unabomber addition }
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{you see, sean? that's exactly not the pointerior no one remembers that. they }
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{well, you're the only one.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{this boy can make contributions to the world. we can help him do that.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{just... take it easy, gerry.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{look, i don't know what else i can say. i'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. but it's important to start early. i was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty three years to do something worthy of a field's medal.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{maybe he doesn't care about that.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{sean, this is important. and it's above personal rivalry }
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{now wait a minute, gerry }
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{no, no you hear me out, sean. this young man is a true prodigy }
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{personal rivalry? i'm not getting back at you.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{look, you took one road and i took another. that's fine.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{is it gerry? 'cause i don't think it's fine with you. give him time to figure out what he wants.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{that's a wonderful theory, sean. it worked wonders for you.}
<A>__{a beat. lambeau gets up.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{sean, i came here today out of courtesy. i wanted to keep you in the loop. as we speak the boy is in a meeting i set up for him over at tri tech.}
