<L>__{interior corridor control module}
<A>__{the control module is a long narrow cabin like the inside of a winnebago, packed with instrumentation. at the end is a small bay with multiple viewports. outside, at a 'christmas tree' pipe installation, a lone diver can be seen welding. he is accompanied by a large submersible, flatbed, and by a remotely operated vehicle, or rov, call little geek. little geek is an underwater robot which operated on the end of a cable like control tether. it has a single video 'eye' in front, by which the operator pilots the little machine. the rig's rov pilots is allen 'hippy' carnes, who stands by the window twiddling his joysticks and drinking coffee. his pet white rat, beany, crawls contentedly around his shoulders. the door bangs open. hippy jumps, slops his coffee. bud strides in. not calm.}
