<A>__{smecker ascends the three, small steps up to the round room. a nude dancer sits there on the couch in a robe. she is crying as she is being consoled by detective duffy. this small room is where men watch girls through a large glass window. in this room a dancer performs on a floor a few feet above the three private booths where each man watches from his own booth. she appears as if on stage. all three windows are shattered and there is blood on the wall of all three booths. we see assorted body parts in each booth, but no faces.}
