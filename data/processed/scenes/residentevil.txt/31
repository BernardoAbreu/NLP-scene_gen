<L>__{ext arkley forest morning}
<A>__{the first of the black hueys drops, hazardously, into a small clearing with barely enough space. unable to land on the scrub brush, it hovers ten feet off the ground. its rotors clip tree leaves as wesker, barry, and two other s.t.a.r.s. commandos jump out, heavily armed. the chopper lifts off, placed by huey number two. not far away, chris navigates through undergrowth until he can see the helicopters through the trees. the thunder from their rotors masks the grinding of chris' jeep. he pulls within a hundred yards and, leaving his vehicle in the bush, moves closer, cautiously, on foot. the third huey air drops two men and two women in s.t.a.r.s. uniforms. there are twelve commandos in all... alpha team. wesker looks up at the huey's pilot, using his radio to speak to the man.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{you'll have to rotate or you'll run out of fuel, but i want one chopper to remain in the air at all times. we might need help in a hurry.}
<A>__{a "roger that", squaks back as the huey banks away. barry looks worried. his instincts are asking... "we might need... 'help'". against what? we only see this in his eyes, he says nothing as... ...wesker leads the team through the woods, unaware of... ...chris, following behind, crouching around trees and bushes, not a trained commando, but comfortable with the land, a natural warrior using ancestral instincts. the camera tracks combat boots as they crunch through the low lying mist.. .stopping abruptly when they encounter... ...weapons, ammo belts, bits of shrdded uniforms... and human body parts... strewn all through the surrounding brush, remnants of what was obviously a feeding frenzy.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{holy... goh... gaah...}
<A>__{brad vickers vomits. unarmed, he's alpha team's computer techie. not a combat soldier, he's a bit of a coward. another non combatant, rebecca chambers, is the team's medical officer. she digs an ammonia capsule from her pack and holds it under vickers' nose. richard aiken and kenneth sullivan are buddies, regular g.i. joes, right out of every war movie. aiken stares at the carnage, calmly chewing a wad of gum.}
<C>__{aiken}
<D>__{you ever eat road kill, sullivan?}
<C>__{sullivan}
<D>__{aiken... a guy with a brain your size would be better off dead.}
<C>__{rodriguez }
<D>__{want me to shoot ya, aiken?}
<A>__{rosie rodriguez, a tough, body built babe steps in.}
<C>__{rodriguez }
<D>__{i'm ready ta shoot somebody.}
<C>__{alken}
<D>__{i will pass. shoot sullivan.}
<A>__{forest speyer, a wiry willem defoe type, finds a bloody beret and brings it to wesker. there's an i.d. tag on the brim...}
<C>__{wesker}
<P>__{(reading the tag) 'valentine'. (beat)}
<D>__{radio washington. bravo team found on site. no survivors.}
<A>__{in the bushes, chris overhears, not wanting to believe. he sees wesker angrily pitch jill's beret into the brush.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{we're goin' in. watch your backs.}
<A>__{wesker advances his troops. when the coast is clear, chris rushes in, picks up the beret, and sees the name tag for himself. "valentine ". after what happened at the farm... now this... feeling sucker punched, defeated, chris hangs his head. one of the hueys dips in low. chris looks up. the sight of the war machine lifts him from defeat... to rage. his eyes are soft, for the last time, as he tucks jill's beret into his pack. when he looks up again, those eyes have become newly predatory. he ducks out of sight as the helicopter swings lower. downdraft from the rotors makes the bushes rustle, catching chris' attention. he realizes that... it's not just the wind. the shrubs are being disturbed by... something dark which is moving through them. it pokes its head out. a wolf! rake was right. chris readies his winchester as the animal stalks forward. it's not a wolf. it's a dog. mottled, its flesh gray, covered with rotting lesions... and it has three bleeding bullet holes in its belly, chest, neck. growrrr! it leaps at chris... who fires... blam! up ahead, wesker and his commandos freeze.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{who fired? who fired?}
<A>__{before anyone can answer, the team is attacked by more dogs which burst out of the surrounding woods...dobermans and shepherds... but something is seriously wrong with all of them. their eyes are dead, their flesh decaying. automatics piss streams of lead. hot rounds tear through the animals, many of the slugs accidentally blowing out brains. of his bullets hits its target... one of the dogs' heads. the commandos are backed up against... the iron gates we saw earlier. the arkley mansion stands beyond.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{let's get inside.}
<C>__{wesker }
<D>__{no! (shouting) i want 'em all dead! you hear me? stand fast... until they are all dead !}
<A>__{the dogs don't stand a chance. alpha team's firepower is overwhelming. but there is a human casualty. joseph frost trips and falls. one of the dogs pounces on him, chewing out his heart... through his back. wesker steps in, riddling the dead man, and the dog, with forty rounds from his m 16. in the next instant, another dog leaps at wesker from behind. he hears its snarl... too late. he dives into the grass... too late. the dog is about to land on him when... ...it's blasted out of mid air by... barry.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{even steven, boss. you saved my ass in the desert. i saved yours i in pennsylvania.}
<A>__{wesker stand, straightening his ever present sunglasses.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{i don't believe in being... 'even steven' with anybody. a man saves my ass...i pay him back. before this day is over, i will pay you back, barry. just... stick with me, okay?}
<A>__{wesker checks his equipment belt. something is missing. he looks to where he rolled in the grass. using a flash light, he finds... ...a small electronic unit the size of a cell phone. but it's not a cell phone. whatever it is... wesker clips it onto his belt. from the brush, chris sees all this. the guns have gone silent. the attack seems to be over. chris moves stealthily to the body of the animal that he shot. it's wearing a collar which reads...}
<D>__{spike #26}
<A>__{alongside the i.d., there's a corporate looking logo... the symbol of an umbrella. grrrowwwll! another dog is advancing on chris. he aims his winchester. click! the magazine is empty. no time to reload. the dog is on him. chris scrambles away. the dog bounds after him. chris drops to the ground. did he trip? no. he pushes a tree root, which is false. it swings open and he dives in, pulling the root shut over him. the dog arrives an instant later. it lets out an angry howl... and is blown away... by rodriguez, who neither saw chris, nor where he went. the forest goes dead quiet. too quiet. there's not even the chirping of morning birds wesker is slapped startlingly on the back... by barry.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{look here, man. i'd follow you into any kind of enemy fire. but these things ain't firin' at us. they want us for breakfast! when are you gonna tell us what the hell is goin' on here?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{when you need to know. just do your job, soldier. that's what i'm doin'. my job.}
<A>__{wesker pulls a chain from under his shirt. it holds a card, the size of a visa, like the one jill found in her secret envelope, only wesker's isn't blue, it's green. stepping away from barry, he slide the card through a slot in the iron gate frame. buzzzz. the gates swing open with a rusty squeal.}
