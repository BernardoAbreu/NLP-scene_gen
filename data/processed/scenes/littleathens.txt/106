<D>__{no wonder victor tried to fuck you.}
<A>__{emily stands up, turns around and heads toward the back door leading into the kitchen, storming past a teenage boy and teenage girl passionately kissing each other against a tree in the back yard. we hang on the couple as emily walks out of frame. as the boy works his way down to her neck, the girl's eyes open for a moment and catch someone watching her. jimmy is standing in the kitchen in front of the door looking out onto the back porch, staring at the couple making out, momentarily transfixed. jimmy's hand is in his pocket, turning his chinese stress balls over and over and over. the girl closes her eyes again, and jimmy is forgotten, the moment lost. jimmy is alone again, still, as usual.}
