<A>__{dil enters, with her new haircut. she goes to turn on the light. he stops her hand.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she looks at her hand on his.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{better in the dark.}

<C>__{dil}
<D>__{so it's true, then?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{you like me better like this.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{she brings her lips to his neck. he lets them stay there. his hands travel up to her blouse. he begins to undo the buttons.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{oh, jimmy }
<A>__{slowly the blouse slips down, exposing her male torso. she falls down to her knees and tugs at his belt.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{no. no. dil... get up...}
<A>__{he raises her to her feet and leads her toward the bed. she stretches languorously down on it. he unzips her skirt slowly, and draws it off. she turns on the bed sexily, her face to the mattress. she is wearing suspender belts underneath her skirt.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{baby...}
<A>__{but fergus stands and walks quietly over to the wardrobe where the soldier's things are. dil on the bed, slowly turns.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{what are you doing, honey...}
<A>__{we see fergus from her point of view, coming toward her with jody's white cricket shirt, glowing eerily in the dark.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{don't call me that }
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{sorry. what you doing?}
<A>__{fergus draws her slowly up to a standing position.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{try this on, dil}
<A>__{he wraps the shirt around her.}
<C>__{dil}
