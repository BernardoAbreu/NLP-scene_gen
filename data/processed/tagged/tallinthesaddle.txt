<A>__{camera pans to show the dusty platform of a typical small arizona town of the late nineties. camera trucks along platform past a line of sleeping figures, consisting of a couple of drunks, an indian, two mexicans and a mongrel dog. camera stops on the window of the ticket office. inside the office can be glimpsed the station agent dozing in a chair with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window. the clicking of the signal indicator is heard. the agent opens his eyes, flips up the indicator and begins to get to his feet sleepily.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{line of sleeping figures, with dog in f.g. the sound of a distant train whistle is heard o.s. the dog, which up to now might have been dead, opens one eye and looks past camera.}

<A>__{on station agent and conductors. the latter signals the engineer. the train whistle sounds again o.s. and the shadow of the moving train begins to pass across the station agent's face.}
<B>__{trucking shot}
<A>__{as rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the other, a man behind him picks up the two mail sacks and exits from scene. the station bums look at rocklin curiously. his expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again. at the ticket office, rocklin pauses and looks around uncertainly.}

<A>__{rocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of dave, the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead horses. he pauses close to one horse's head. rocklin sees dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances around, and raise it to drink. the bottle is almost to dave's lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. the bottle is knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground. now rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds amusing despite its seriousness. old dave rants and snorts beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and exhibits his utter disgust generally.}

<A>__{he stops talking abruptly because his hand has, quite by chance, felt the spare bottle he carries, which he has forgotten in his anger. a most satisfying smile lights his bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view. he uncorks it, and stepping a few paces from the horse, raises the bottle.}

<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{mind if i ride up here?}
<A>__{dave does mind, but his better judgment tells him to step carefully in his attitude toward this stranger, who does things first, then asks permission. his only answer to rocklin is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough. and now dave turns on the agent, who becomes the target of his pent up wrath.}

<D>__{ harolday wanted the k.c. like he wanted the santee and the hardman place, for his land scheme he planned on breaking up the ranches into small holdings and selling to dirt farmers. he pretended to be on the outs with me so i could get caldwell's confidence. and when red caught me with the crooked cards and threatened to expose me harolday shot him.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{why did he kill clint? an' not me?}

<P>__{(moves close to garvey)}
<D>__{you vile wicked despicable }
<A>__{she is beside herself in her anger and taking up a large vase sitting nearby, she smashes it to pieces over garvey's head. garvey goes down unconscious. miss martin rushes to her room screaming. clara follows her. on dave grinning broadly rocklin comes to him}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{when he wakes up we'll have him put everything on paper.}

<A>__{he starts away down the hall, rolling up his sleeves. rocklin's eyes wander to clara, who seems quite at a loss. now he moves slowly toward her. in the b.g. arly watches rocklin's every move.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{i guess there's no rush for you to get to garden city, now }
<A>__{after a slight pause in which she becomes conscious of arly, clara speaks.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{no i don't suppose there's any rush }
<A>__{there is another short pause. rocklin glances at arly, and arly assuming they want to be alone, turns and goes out the door, leaving julio attending garvey.}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(after arly goes)}
<D>__{if i was like her, i'd stay in the west.}

<A>__{rocklin takes it a faint smile brushes his face. he turns now and walks out.}
<T>__{dissolve out: dissolve in:}
<L>__{exterior grounds near caldwell house sun up}
<A>__{arly is seated on the shaft of an old wagon. the first rays of the morning sun streak through the trees across her as she smiles wistfully down at the antics of a little woodchuck cavorting on the ground close to her. in a moment rocklin comes into view in the b.g. he spots arly, who has her back to him, and walks over. his approach frightens the woodchuck away, and turns arly's head toward him. neither has anything to say. now rocklin sits beside arly, but faces the other way.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{arly}
