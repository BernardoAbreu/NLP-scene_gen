<L>__{exterior central mumbai traffic. day.}
<A>__{a group of children are sitting in the jumble of concrete under a motorway flyover. cars surround them, bumper to bumper. latika and jamal are playing an improvised hopscotch on concrete slabs. they are giggling, bumping into each other, tickling, laughing. salim and punnoose are sitting together, smoking. salim is staring hard at jamal and latika until punnoose grunts, a sign for salim to clap his hands.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{okay, let's go, let's go! it's not a bloody holiday!}
<A>__{the children get to their feet. latika sighs, puts a patch over her eye and grabs a pair of crutches. suddenly, the lame beggar. salim goes over to one of the girls, who is carrying a sleeping baby. puts out his hand.}
<C>__{salim }
<D>__{give me that.}
<A>__{the girl shakes her head. salim grabs her by the hair in one hand and takes the baby with the other. he shoves her to the ground. the other children stare.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{hey, salim!}
<A>__{he challenges jamal.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{what, chote bhai? you got a problem?}
<A>__{he laughs and walks over to latika.}
<C>__{salim }
<D>__{here. for you.}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{i don't want it.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{you'll earn double. i'm doing you a favour, latika.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{she doesn't want it.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{chup, jamal.}
<A>__{latika turns away and begins to walk towards the cars.}
<C>__{salim }
<D>__{i will drop it.}
<A>__{he holds the baby up. latika grabs the baby with a cry just as salim releases it from his hands. salim pinches the baby.}
<C>__{salim }
<D>__{triple if it's crying.}
<A>__{latika snatches it away. salim laughs, goes back to sitting with punnoose. the children scatter to the cars trapped at the lights, tapping plaintively on the windows and making the universal begging gesture.}
