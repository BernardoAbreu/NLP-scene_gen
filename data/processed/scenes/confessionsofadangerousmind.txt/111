<L>__{interior empty living room night}
<A>__{barris and penny are having sex on the floor.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{so, man, are you seeing anyone?}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{nobody serious. you?}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{no. i think we should get married.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{aw, pen, don't start }
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{no, listen, it makes sense. you and i feel exactly the same about marriage, right? how much bullshit it is, right? and the odds of us finding someone else with the exact same view on it are small. so, it makes sense.}
