<L>__{interior bedroom}
<A>__{it is dark now. a single desk light is on, under which rath is setting up his chess board, putting the pieces in their familiar pattern. electra comes out of the bathroom. she seems very clean and fresh, wearing a long white t shirt and thin robe.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{that felt great. you should try it.}
<A>__{she watches him setting the pieces onto the board.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{don't you ever get tired of playing the same game?}
<A>__{he looks at her.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{it helps me to focus. it centers me, helps me think.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{oh. what do you think about?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{work. the things i need to get done.}
<A>__{she sits across from him looking at the board.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{do you think about the game?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{but you've never figured out a way to win.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{not even a stalemate?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{what happens if you do?}
<A>__{this strikes rath as a very strange question and he is suddenly annoyed by her.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{can i ask you something?}
<A>__{he knows she will anyway.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{what will you do if this works, if we get the money?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i don't know... maybe i will live on a boat, sail to all the places i've never been.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{that sounds nice.}
<A>__{he finishes his glass of bourbon. she is not sure what to say next, if she should say anything at all.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{i'm kind of tired. i think i'd like to try and get some sleep.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you can have the bed. the chair is fine for me.}
<A>__{he pours himself another drink, dropping in some ice from the ice bucket.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{she slips out of the robe and in between the sheets. rath sits across the room, his back to her. she tries to make herself comfortable, but cannot.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{do you think he's here?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{here?}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{in costa blanca.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{she thinks.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{what do you think he's doing?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i don't know... but i'm sure he's not sleeping.}
<A>__{she pulls the covers tightly to her chin. her eyes do not close.}
