<L>__{extreme tight shot cell phone}
<A>__{cupped in stu's hand and held low. can they hear him on the other end?}
<C>__{emergency operator}
<P>__{(muffled, almost inaudible)}
<D>__{can you speak up, sir? what is your name?}
<A>__{stu is concerned that the sniper might hear the voice of the emergency operator. he sets the cell phone down flat on the floor of the booth facing upward. he puts his foot over the receiving end to muffle the incoming voice. then he stands up.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{that's better, stu. now turn around so i can see you.}
<A>__{stu talks close into the pay phone receiver now. but keeps his voice raised.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{this booth. it's my whole world shrunk down to four feet by three feet. not much bigger than the size of a coffin.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{they can put handles on the booth and bury you in it.}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(loudly into pay phone)}
<D>__{when i saw you put that bullet into that black dude, i knew you'd never let me out of this phone booth alive.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{you're wasting my time. reach up and take the gun.}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(peering upward, squinting)}
<D>__{let me see you first. what harm can that do you? you're in one of those windows. i've got to know which one.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{no need for that.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{being so far, i could never identify you. i don't even want to.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{what is it then?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{don't worry that i'd try to point you out. you'd shut me up with one of your .30 calibre hollow points before i could even raise a finger.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{why does it matter so much?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i want to see that you exist. like god exists. it's not enough to believe. you want to see him just once even at a distance.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{and then you'd take the gun down. and use it. we have a deal on that?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{show yourself to me and i will take the gun down. i swear.}
<A>__{there's a pause as the sniper mulls it over.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i don't have to make deals. and you're irritating me by trying to negotiate. god doesn't have to prove anything. he just strikes you down when he gets in the mood.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{stop! i won't ask to see you anymore.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i'm glad that's settled. but look who else has showed up?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i guess she saw the coverage on tv and just couldn't keep away.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{the 'hotel' just arrived. and a very beautiful little hotel she is. actually, i'd classify her as more of a motel.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{mavis? i don't see her.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{she's too far back behind the police line. but i've got a fine shot at her from up here.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{you don't even know what she looks like.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{you're in an enviable position now, stu. you get to choose between them. tell me which one.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{which will it be? kelly or mavis? or should i simply select one?}
<A>__{insert shot the cell phone lying face up on the floor of the booth. is anybody listening?}
<B>__{back to stu}
<A>__{stu looks down at the cellular. he has no way of knowing if the police operator can hear any of his words.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i need time to think...}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{you've got to be more in touch with your feelings. you said you love kelly.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{then i'm doing you a favor putting you out of the way of temptation.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{it wasn't mavis' fault. it was all my fault.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{then take the third option. reach above you and pick up the gun.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{you'll leave them both alone?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{there won't be much point in harming them without you around to impress.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i will do it.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{let me see you do it.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i need one minute. one last minute, please. can you give me that?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{don't tell me you're going to say your prayers?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{something like that.}
<A>__{we rack focus away to long shot the police assembled on the opposite side of the street.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{they should've traced the fucking call by now.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<P>__{(listening on transmitter)}
<D>__{there's something else coming in. a 911 operator says your name was mentioned by somebody that's still on the line. somebody talking about a phone booth. and a sniper.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{patch me through. hello, this is captain edward ramey. what about that call?}
<C>__{emergency operator}
<D>__{the line is still open. it's originating from a booth at 45th and 8th.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{we're there! can you play me back your recording of the entire call?}
<C>__{emergency operator}
<D>__{i can't replay the tape while it's still running.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{then switch to another machine and play back what you've got.}
<C>__{emergency operator}
<D>__{it's awful fainterior he's not talking directly into the receiver.}
<A>__{ramey begins to listen. we hear snatches of stu's call picking up words which are at times incomprehensible.}
<C>__{stu's voice}
<P>__{(faint)}
<D>__{'who's going to believe i've got a sniper with a telescopic sight holding me in some fucking phone booth...'}
<A>__{the uniformed telephone technician now joins ramey and the sergeant.}
<C>__{telephone technician}
<D>__{got what you wanted. the call's coming from up the street. the hotel broadway.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{have you got the room?}
<C>__{telephone technician}
<D>__{it's not that easy. electronic switchboard.}
<C>__{ramey}
<P>__{(to sergeant)}
<D>__{move your swat units to the hotel. no... wait. any movement will alert the sniper. if he sees any of us withdraw, he may panic.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{there's another swat unit on the way.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{intercept them. divert them to the hotel.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{it's done.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{send them in from the forty third street side. i don't want any activity the sniper might catch sight of. he's probably high up and facing that booth. he's got to continue to believe our full attention is focused on the man inside whoever the hell that poor bastard is.}
<P>__{(to emergency operator)}
<D>__{hello 911 operator, i missed some of that. run it halfway back and repeat it.}
<C>__{stu's voice }
<P>__{(faint)}
<D>__{'... like you did that pimp. and that tourist last week. but this time you want me to do the killing for you...'}
<C>__{ramey}
<P>__{(listening)}
<D>__{jesus... he's a dead man.}
<B>__{back inside phone booth}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{the police seem all excited about something, stu.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{are they? i wasn't looking.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i can't wait any longer. say amen, then reach up for the gun. when your hand comes down, i want to see it.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i'm too afraid.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{for once, be brave. surprise yourself.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i'm shaking all over.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{guys in combat situations even shit their pants. but they follow orders.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{as soon as the cops see a gun, they'll open fire.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{then i'd advise you to fire first.}
<A>__{stu's arm goes up in a supreme act of willpower. his fingers run along the two clouded plastic sheets that cover the roof of the booth. it raises up easily at the middle where two sheets join.}
<B>__{tight insert shot}
<A>__{the space between the roof of the booth and the sheets of clouded plastic. we see the fluorescent lighting fixture covered with dust. the solitary object a cruel looking weapon. now stu's fingertips protrude into the small space. he touches the gun, brushes back and forth, feeling the roughness of the grip. tight shot stu's face as below he continues to hesitate it's agony the sweat pours down his forehead and his eyes are squeezed tightly shut. he can already imagine the police bullets tearing into him.}
<B>__{a police sniper is moving into position.}
<C>__{police sniper}
<P>__{(into transmitter)}
<D>__{give me the word.}
<A>__{rack back to stu in the booth his arm still raised. he hasn't brought it down with the gun in it. not yet. he holds the pay phone receiver jammed up against his mouth.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hard part's over. drop your arm and point it like you'd point your finger and squeeze.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{no. you do it. if you want me dead, then fucking murder me!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{why must i keep invoking some poor girl's name every time we come to an impasse? i'm focused back on kelly again. you're obviously not willing to trade your life for hers.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i am! i'm doing it!}
<A>__{he pulls the handgun down into full view. curiously, the police do not open fire.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{there! you see it? they all see it.}
<A>__{he waves the gun so nobody can miss it.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{where are you? damn you!!}
<A>__{he drops the receiver and steps halfway out of the booth. still the cops do not open fire. then stu starts shooting. not at the police, but at the high rise buildings across the street. at the thousands of windows that look down upon him. he gets off two shots before a solitary rifle shot rings out in response.}
<B>__{rack focus to the police sniper}
<A>__{he has fired.}
<B>__{angle on stu}
<A>__{the remaining glass on the south side of the booth shatters. stu tumbles forward, sprawling out of the booth onto the pavement.}
<B>__{rack focus to kelly}
<A>__{she screams, tries to break through but cops restrain her.}
