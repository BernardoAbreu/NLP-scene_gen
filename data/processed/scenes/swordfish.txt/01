<L>__{interior starbucks coffee shop morning}
<A>__{three men sit at a window booth drinking coffee and talking. two of the men sit on one side of the table; stanley is in his early thirties, agent roberts, early forties. both wear suits, the younger's is fairly expensive and well cut, the other's is polyester, enough said. the man across, however, is quite different. he is what they used to call a "cool cat."}
<C>__{gabriel }
<D>__{take dog day afternoon for example. arguably pacino's greatest performance, excepting the godfather, part i, and scarface, of course. a masterpiece of directing, easily lumet's best. the acting, the script, cinematography, all top notch. but, they didn't push the envelope. what if in dog day, sonny really wanted to get away with it? what if, and here's where it gets tricky. what if they'd started killing hostages? no mercy, no quarter, meet our demands or the cute blonde in the bell bottoms gets one in the back of the head, bam, splatter. what? still no bus?}
<C>__{gabriel }
<D>__{how many innocent victims would they let get sprayed across the windows before the city reversed its policy on hostage situations? and this was 1976. no c.n.n., no c.n.b.c., no m.t.v. no internet. fast forward to the present, same situation. can you imagine the feeding frenzy of the modern media? in hours it would be the top story from boston to budapest. all caught in 150 millimeter zoom, computer enhanced, and color corrected. you would practically taste the brain matter. six hostages die. ten. twelve. twenty. thirty. relentless. one after another. all over a bus, a plane, and a couple of million dollars that were federally insured.}
<A>__{he sits, letting the pictures sink in, then:}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{just a thought. i mean it's not really within the realm of conventional cinema, but what if...?}
<C>__{roberts}
<D>__{you know, this movie of yours, i don't think it would have worked.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{really? how come?}
<C>__{roberts}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{audiences love happy endings.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{pacino escapes. with the money. boyfriend gets the sex change operation. they live happily ever after.}
<A>__{stanley shakes his head.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{homophobia?}
<A>__{stanley shakes his head.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{bad guy can't win. it's a morality tale. one way or the other, he's gotta go down.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{oh, well. life does tend to be stranger than fiction.}
<P>__{(looking at watch)}
<D>__{well, guys, gotta jet. this place is kinda dead.}
<A>__{camera pans around the coffee shop. not a soul in the place. we continue to pan around 270 degrees to the front door, which is open. outside the open doorway are crouched a squad of heavily body armored swat members, packed together, and aiming automatic weapons inside.}
<B>__{angle on gabriel}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{thanks for the coffee.}
<A>__{he gets up. in his left hand, which has been hidden by the table until now, he is holding a strange looking spring loaded grip. gabriel is looking back at them. smiles.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{rene descartes is sitting in some bar in paris. bartender says, 'hey, you want another drink?' descartes says, 'i think not.' and disappears.}
<A>__{he smiles at his own joke, then turns and walks over to the front door.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{move.}
<A>__{no one even twitches.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i won't ask again.}
<A>__{he lifts up the device in his left hand.}
<B>__{angle on roberts}
<A>__{who nods his head. the swat team moves back, letting gabriel out of the coffee shop.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{gabriel looks back at stan sitting in the booth.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{stanley... you coming?}
<A>__{stan slides from the booth as gabriel exits the coffee shop }
