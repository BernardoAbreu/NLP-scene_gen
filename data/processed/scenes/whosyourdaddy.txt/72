<A>__{mom drives up to the house. she stares, aghast. there are tall, beautiful, angels everywhere. one cuts the grass. another pulls weeds. two others on the roof, cleaning gutters. still others wash the car...with jimmy handling the water hose. drenching the women, more than the car. shrieks and giggles all around. neighbors gawk. ted's dad guiltily enjoys the view, but quickly rushes to his wife. she gets out of her car and steadies herself on his arm.}
