<L>__{exterior tatooine anchorhead settlement power station day}
<A>__{luke and biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. fixer and the others can be heard working inside.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(very animated)}
<D>__{...so i cut off my power, shut down the afterburners and came in low on deak's trail. i was so close i thought i was going to fry my instruments. as it was i busted up the skyhopper pretty bad. uncle owen was pretty upset. he grounded me for the rest of the season. you should have been there... it was fantastic.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{you ought to take it easy luke. you may be the hottest bushpilot this side of mos eisley, but those little skyhoppers are dangerous. keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{look who's talking. now that you've been around those giant starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. you've gotten soft in the city...}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{i've missed you kid.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, things haven't been the same since you left, biggs. it's been so... quiet.}
<A>__{biggs looks around then leans close to luke.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{luke, i didn't come back just to say good bye... i shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one i can trust... and if i don't come back, i want somebody to know.}
<A>__{luke's eyes are wide with biggs' seriousness and loyalty.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{i made some friends at the academy.}
<P>__{(he whispers)}
<D>__{...when our frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship and join the alliance...}
<A>__{luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{join the rebellion?! are you kidding! how?}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{quiet down will ya! you got a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm quiet.}
<P>__{(he whispers)}
<D>__{listen how quiet i am. you can barely hear me...}
<A>__{biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{my friend has a friend on bestine who might help us make contact.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you're crazy! you could wander around forever trying to find them.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{i know it's a long shot, but if i don't find them i will do what i can on my own... it's what we always talked about. luke, i'm not going to wait for the empire to draft me into service. the rebellion is spreading and i want to be on the right side the side i believe in.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{and i'm stuck here...}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{i thought you were going to the academy next term. you'll get your chance to get off this rock.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{not likely! i had to cancel my application. there has been a lot of unrest among the sandpeople since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of anchorhead.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{your uncle could hold off a whole colony of sandpeople with one blaster.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place pay off. he needs me for just one more season. i can't leave him now.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{i feel for you, luke, you're going to have to learn what seems to be important or what really is important. what good is all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the empire?... you know they're starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater glory of the empire.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it couldn't happen here. you said it yourself. the empire won't bother with this rock.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{things always change.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i wish i was going... are you going to be around long?}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{no, i'm leaving in the morning...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{then i guess i won't see you.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{maybe someday... i will keep a lookout.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, i will be at the academy next season... after that who knows. i won't be drafted into the imperial starfleet that's for sure... take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend i've got.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{so long, luke.}
<A>__{biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the power station.}
