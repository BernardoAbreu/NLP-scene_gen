<L>__{interior suv day}
<A>__{no sound. we are in a speeding suv. the passenger, lara, unsnaps her seat belt and reaches for the door handle. the driver, john, sees her door open and dives to grab her. the suv spins, horns blare, tires screech, cars swerve to avoid collision. we aren't sure what is happening, but we know something has gone terribly wrong. cut to black. read:}
<C>__{the last three years}
<L>__{interior steak house night}
<A>__{two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert, john and lara brennan on one side, mick and erit on the other. john is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a kid with a discipline problem. you have to really know him to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. he is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd. lara looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. she appears to have had a hard day at the office. she's been drinking at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. john's good looking brother, mick, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous, if slightly trashy, girlfriend, erit, who isn't ashamed of her body or sharing her opinions. john and mick are laughing. lara puts cash on the tray beside mick's credit card.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{you know what? if you were smart you would stop talking right now.}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{sue me. i just know that women should never work for women.}
<A>__{john laughs and applauds. mick buries his head.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{how can you say that??}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{they're always threatened. especially if you're beautiful and they're not.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{erit, you are so full of shit.}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{so, your boss isn't threatened by you?}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{because she's a bitch! }
<P>__{(as john and mick laugh)}
<D>__{ not because she's a woman.}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{and you would describe her as "attractive"?}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{that has nothing to do with it!}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{and there is my answer.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{either of you like another drink?}
<A>__{lara shoots john a burning look as erit builds on her victory.}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{women should work under men, men under women. that's it.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(egging her on)}
<D>__{but men under men?}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{that's fine, too.}
<P>__{(the men burst into laughter)}
<D>__{they're used to it! why are you laughing?}
<C>__{mick}
<P>__{(re: erit)}
<D>__{i don't know, bro, but i think i'd rather work under you than her.}
<C>__{erit}
<P>__{(insulted, shoots back)}
<D>__{oh please, i'd rather work under him, too.}
<A>__{that was a dig at mick but lara is primed for a fight.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{you'd rather "work under" john?}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{you have a problem with that, too?}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{no, why would i have a problem with your little sexual innuendo?}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{what is up your ass tonight??}
<A>__{mick throws john a "this is all your fault and now it is going to explode" look. john feigns complete innocence.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{so, i shouldn't take offense that you're coming on to my husband right in front of me.}
<C>__{erit}
<P>__{(claws out now)}
<D>__{lara, if i wanted your husband i would have him.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{how? you couldn't possibly show him more of your tits.}
<A>__{the men are on their feet before blows are exchanged.}
<C>__{erit}
<D>__{ you know what your problem is?!}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that was a great meal!}
<C>__{mick}
<D>__{okay okay!}
<L>__{exterior steak house parking lot night}
<A>__{mick and erit head toward mick's sporty pickup. john and lara step into foreground, lara still fuming.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{she is completely full of shit.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{don't try and agree with me now.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you know what? i don't even believe she is in the dental profession.}
<A>__{lara knows this game; he is trying to get her out of her black mood, and she has no intention of letting him.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i bet she can't even spell anesthesiologist. woman's a complete fraud.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{we went to her office party, idiot.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i think she hit on me that night, too.}
<A>__{lara opens the back door of their black prius and tosses in the raincoat she was carrying. they climb in, under....}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{you are completely delusional. she wasn't even hitting on you in there; i just don't like her.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i understand. people who look like that should not be allowed anywhere near oral surgery.}
<A>__{she feels a smile coming to her lips and tries to force it away.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{you are such an asshole.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you're in the chair trying to stay calm; how are you supposed to do that with those things hanging over your }
<A>__{she can't stand how attractive he is in this moment she stops him short by kissing him passionately. his hands slip under her blouse; she tugs at his sweater.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{someone's going to }
<A>__{her hand goes to his pants. he yanks at the seat lever and it goes crashing back, lara landing atop him. after a moment he sits up quickly and pushes down the visors. she laughs and kisses him and they disappear into each other.}

<A>__{lara and john enter, lara carrying her raincoat, her hair sticking up in the back, john's shirt untucked.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{hello!}
<A>__{jenna, the teenage baby sitter, sees right through them.}
<C>__{lara }
<D>__{did he cry?}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{only when i dropped him down the stairs.}
<A>__{lara shoots her a look, hangs up her coat and exits upstairs.}

<A>__{she peeks in her son's room, sees him sleeping soundly.}
<L>__{interior brennan house foyer}
<A>__{lara comes down to find john paying jenna. john nods for her to check the mirror. she tugs at the knot in her hair.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{thanks. see you next weekend.}
<A>__{jenna exits. lara shows him that his sweater is inside out. john reacts: "oh god." lara's smile broadens; she kisses him. he pins her to the wall and they start all over again. he feels for the light switch. he finds it; we cut to black.}

<A>__{lara wakes, troubled. it's the middle of the night.}
<L>__{interior luke's room night}

<C>__{lara}
<D>__{after yesterday i probably don't have a job anyway. do you think it was wrong to call her a useless cow?}
<C>__{john}

<D>__{now she's driving a wedge between us.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{i give up.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{and now she is abandoning you.}
<A>__{lara grabs her raincoat and notices a stain on the back shoulder. irritated, she heads back to the bathroom.}
<L>__{interior brennan house downstairs bathroom}

<C>__{john }
<D>__{you're such a snake, i don't know why i keep falling for the same trick.}
<A>__{john kisses luke, who closes his eyes and snuggles his pillow. john reaches for the lamp. beside it sits the framed photo that lara snapped of the three of them that fateful morning. he switches off the lamp, and the screen goes black.}

<D>__{wow. i bet that hurt.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah.}
<L>__{interior county jail entry hall day}
<A>__{ john waits in a long line, mostly women. he glances over at the pleasant and colorful play area in the corner and sees children playing. luke plays by himself. john puts his key ring in a plastic container. the guard takes it and puts the keys with other visitors' belongings. john guides his son toward the metal detector. luke walks through and the buzzer goes off. john instinctively moves forward to help. a guard stops him with a hand on his chest. on the other side of the metal detector another guard runs a wand over luke, pulls something from his pocket, looks at it curiously.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's a toy!}
<A>__{the guard runs the wand over the child again; no screech. the guard waves john through. no beep. john kneels and pulls on luke's jacket.}

<A>__{they walk along the hall with all the other visitors.}
<L>__{interior county jail contact visiting room day}
<A>__{john stares out the window at the city beyond. life seems so close. he looks back into the large communal visiting room; a dozen round tables and plastic chairs. the concrete block walls are covered with naive paintings in bright colors and messages of hope. luke plays at his feet with a basket of legos. the door at the far side buzzes, a guard opens it and prisoners in red jump suits marked visiting room enter. lara enters and looks around. she is pale, thin and her hair has returned to its natural color. lara hurries to him and gives him a real kiss. she breaks and steps to luke, who plays with his back to her.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{hi honey. can mommy get a kiss?}
<P>__{(no response. tickles him)}

<D>__{every night at bedtime.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{what are you building? a fort?}

<D>__{was he scared going to school?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i walked him to class, gave him a kiss; he didn't even look back to wave.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{what did you make him for lunch?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{turkey sandwich, just butter and bread, no "vegetables" on it. he swore he ate his apple.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{about the appeal? yes, and i'm just not telling you. what did meyer say?}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{ oh, that i can do.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{you can change this rule about no conjugal visits, because i don't think i can last another twenty years.}

<C>__{lara }
<D>__{i'm okay. i'm okay.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i know. but it's going to be fine. i promise.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{luke! let's go, toad. come on.}

<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{time to go, carrie!}
<A>__{john glances in time to see carrie plop down in the sand, arms folded. he shares a sympathetic smile with nicole, who heads to retrieve her daughter. john walks off with luke.}

<D>__{the pcra was rejected. no new evidence can be submitted. not anymore.}

<A>__{john offers a smile at meyer's unlawyer like choice of words.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so, that's it. now we just have the supreme court.}
<C>__{meyer}
<D>__{john, in the last thirty years, the supreme court hasn't heard one murder case. no decent lawyer would even file the pleadings.}
