<A>__{sees both moves and interrupts the senator.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{senator, excuse me a moment }
<A>__{he turns to felicia and then looks over toward jackie's empty chair and literally doesn't know which way to go first. he's a little like the bear in the penny arcade that is shot and keeps turning one way, then another. finally he heads toward jackie's vacant chair and george.}
