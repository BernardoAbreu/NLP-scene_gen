<A>__{engelman and spreg jump out of the truck, taking cover behind it. they rake the limo with bursts from their ak }
<L>__{47s.}
<A>__{inside the car. lenny and mace keep their heads down below the door frame. it sounds like they are inside a steel drum in some psychotic calypso band. but the armored body panels hold. lenny is punching his cellular.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{goddamnit!! 911 is busy!}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{it's okay, lenny}
<P>__{(he looks at her hopefully)}
<D>__{they'd never get here in time anyway.}
<A>__{mace has reloaded her sig and is trying to open the door on her side (away from the bad guys). it is jammed from the sideswiping. spreg reaches into the bed of the truck and pulls out a gallon gas can. he uncaps it and throws it across the pavement. it slides under the limo, glugging its contents onto the ground. spreg grabs a road flare from under the seat of the truck and strikes the cap, lighting it. he tosses the flare under the limo... ka whoomph!! the gas can explodes in a fireball. the continental is engulfed in flames. from the inside all lenny and mace can see is fire. all the windows are covered in roaring flames.}
<C>__{mace}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{this is bad.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{the gas tank's going to go any second!}
<A>__{mace slams the car into gear and floors it. the powerful lincoln thunders forward. it crashes through a chain link fence and launches right off the end of the pier. a fireball plunging in a meteoric arc into the oily black water. inside, they are slammed forward by the impact. the car sinks. underwater: the car hits bottom, twenty feet down, sitting there amid the junk. shafts of light play down from the big streetlights at the end of the pier. inside, lenny and mace are in a flooding black tomb.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{are you out of your fucking mind?!}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{fire's out, isn't it?}
<A>__{she scrambles into the back seat. she wrenches at the rear seatback, pulls it free... and crawls half into the huge trunk. water is up around their legs. she grabs her shotgun: a sawed off ten gauge.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{get in here. come on lenny, move it. move!!}
<A>__{mace yanks him toward her and he tumbles in.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{get ready to hold your breath.}
<A>__{she aims the ten gauge at the trunk latch mechanism.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{lenny, kick out hard, then just follow me. okay?}
<A>__{he nods. blam!! she blows the trunk latch into shrapnel. the trunk lid belches open in a whoosh of bubbles. lenny and mace kick out, heading toward the lights of the pier. on the surface: mace breaks the surface slowly alongside the slimy concrete wall. lenny comes up beside her, spluttering. her hand goes over his mouth. they are in the inky shadows under a massive bumper made of rail road ties. engelman and spreg are standing above them, scanning the black water over the barrels of their aks.}
<C>__{spreg}
<D>__{let's get out of here.}
<A>__{they run back to the truck and high tail it out of there. down below, lenny and mace are clinging to the pier, chest deep in the water. they hear the truck pulling away. they let out a big exhalations of relief.}
