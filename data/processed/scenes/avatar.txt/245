<A>__{something slams into the other `suit, tackling it out of frame. wainfleet whirls to see his squad mate missing. he moves through a screen of foliage to reveal the ampsuit ripped open. driver gone. blood inside the cockpit. he whirls at a sound in time to see a thanator leaping straight at him wainfleet raises his cannon but wham!! it's on him, slamming him to the ground. the cannon goes flying. he's face to face with its nightmare jaws, right outside his canopy on its back is neytiri, and it's a toss up which one looks more pissed off. the thanator rears back, muscles rippling as it poises to strike and k kraaackk! slams its teeth right through his canopy. wainfleet's scream is brief. neytiri's demon mount rears up and its triumphant roar echoes through the forest.}
