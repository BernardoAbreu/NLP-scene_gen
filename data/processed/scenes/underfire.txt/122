<L>__{exterior the rooftop garden of the intercontinental day}
<A>__{journalists are gathered to watch the fighting which is now on the outskirts of managua. price stands to the side casually taking pictures of journalists taking pictures of the war. hub kittle floats around providing drinks and p.r. p.o.v. a push pull airplane makes bombing passes on the capitol. columns of smoke rise throughout the city. regis moves his mini cam crew into position at the rail}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{we got the smoke in frame?}
<C>__{crewmember}
<P>__{(moves the camera slightly)}
<D>__{we got the smoke.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{roll it...}
<A>__{claire stands to the other side with binoculars watching. she accepts a drink from hub and speaks into her tape deck.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{under a steel gray july sky... start again... under a gray steel managuan sky... scratch it... in an extraordinary development in managua, president anastazio somoza has ordered the air force to begin bombing his own capitol, under a sky... fuck it...}
<A>__{she fires down the drink and puts down the mike. she picks up the binoculars again and, glancing below, is shocked: p.o.v. below alex gets out of a cab with his suitcases he starts into the hotel, glances up, and they see each other.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{oh my god...}
<A>__{price sees alex at the same time. alex waves to both of as he heads into the hotel. price and claire look at each other. claire sits down at a table, stunned to see alex. price commandeers a waiter and joins her with a fresh tray of drinks.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{a scotch, please...}
<P>__{(he nods)}
<D>__{double.}
<A>__{price joins her as other journalists jockey for position at the railing. he is equally upset and confused.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{what's he doing here?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<A>__{alex comes through the door with a couple journalists, sees price and claire and comes over to join them. a polite kiss on claire's cheek, a handshake for price. a moment of awkwardness.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{congratulations.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{on what?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{on what?! the washington post, the times, networks, wire services everybody's picked up the picture. it's fabulous.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{well, yes... it's fabulous.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{fabulous.}
<A>__{unsure silence.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{why are you back?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i came back because of russell.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{because of me?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yeah... the whole fucking east coast is falling in love with rafael they were sure he was dead this time. somebody wants to do a musical about him and his mug's on every t shirt in central park.}
<A>__{alex enjoys the lunatic mixture of politics and popular culture.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i think he's bigger than farrah fawcett.}
<A>__{claire and price struggle to enjoy this supremely uncomfortable moment. it's not easy to enter the game. claire attempts to change the subject.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you look good. things're okay?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm happier in new york, sure, things are great. you guys?}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{terrific... now... i'm a little slow here, alex... what exactly did you come back for?}
<A>__{no more games. alex addresses price with conviction.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's a great story.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i want to talk to rafael... and you're the only man in the world that can take me to him.}
<A>__{price's and claire's hearts sink. they look at each other. alex, despite his reluctance to return to nicaragua, seems genuinely enthused about the possible story. before price or claire respond, hub kittle notices alex and comes over with a tray of drinks, extending genuine greetings to the senior correspondent.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{alex! couldn't stay away, eh?}
<A>__{the fresh round of drinks are put on the table. the sound of bombs ripping the capitol are the only thing we hear.}
