<A>__{pop out wide to reveal that the bird is eating out of a girl's hand... this is angie: 25, blonde black roots... micro mini skirt, fishnets, boots... green eyes, haunted, with sadness behind them; pretty the clothes don't quite match her; it's like someone dressed her up as a hooker.... she doesn't seem to notice the little bird munching away; she stands in the middle of the park, looking around, lost. she spots a guy standing by himself near a giant sculpture. she walks over to him; the bird flutters away. the guy is young and attractive, dressed in casual business attire. he is wearing a plastic pig snout on his face, tied with an elastic band.}
