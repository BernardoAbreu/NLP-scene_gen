<A>__{establishing shot. a plane lands.}
<L>__{interior phoenix airport day}
<A>__{roy, looking stunned, is among the deplaning passengers spreading out across the terminal. he's met by pierson, a plainclothes detective, and a uniformed cop.}
<C>__{pierson}
<D>__{roy dillon?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{pierson}
<D>__{lieutenant pierson, phoenix police. i have a car here.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{thank you.}
<L>__{interior police car day}
<A>__{the uniformed cop drives. pierson and roy sit in back.}
<C>__{pierson}
<D>__{i realize this is a shock.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{well, mostly, i don't believe it.}
<C>__{pierson}
<D>__{that's natural.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{no. i mean, i don't believe it. lilly is not a suicide. i know my mother, nothing would make her check out.}
<C>__{pierson}
<D>__{i'm sorry, it was her all right. her gun, even.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{gun?}
<C>__{pierson}
<D>__{i grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. it really is your mother, mister dillon.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{it may be lilly, but it isn't suicide.}
<C>__{pierson}
<P>__{(interested)}
<D>__{do you have any particular reason to say that?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{my mother... well, i guess it doesn't matter now. she worked for gamblers. she always knew they might turn on her some day.}
<C>__{pierson}
<P>__{(thoughtful)}
<D>__{a hit, you mean. honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but i will certainly consider the possibility. thank you for telling me.}
<A>__{the car stops.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{not that it matters.}
<P>__{(looks out)}
<D>__{this is the morgue?}
<C>__{pierson}
<D>__{you up to it now?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{sure. let's get it over.}
<C>__{pierson}
<D>__{one thing i have to caution you about. a gunshot wound...}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{yes, i know, i know.}
<C>__{pierson}
<P>__{(reluctant)}
<D>__{well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(not understanding)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{pierson}
<D>__{i'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, i'm, to tell you the truth, mr. dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(low; getting it)}
<D>__{ate the gun. oh.}
<C>__{pierson}
<D>__{someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. it's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(opening the door)}
<D>__{well, let's get the shock over with.}
