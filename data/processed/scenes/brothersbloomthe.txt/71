<A>__{victorian, expensive. penelope leans against the window, looking out. sulking. bloom enters.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{so what kind of stuff do you do?}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{nothing. maybe you should go.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{alright. i'm just gonna finish my coffee first.}
<A>__{very slowly, he sips it. each sip becomes a noisier and noisier slurp.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{i collect hobbies. i see someone doing something i like, and i get books and learn how to do it.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{hm. anything interesting?}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{not really.}
<B>__{hobby montage}
<A>__{in which penelope demonstrates the following with exacting seriousness and skill for bloom: playing the piano. the classical guitar. the fiddle. the banjo. putting the finishing touches on a ship in a bottle. executing a perfect ollie on a skateboard. juggling various items. riding a unicycle. juggling while riding a unicycle. playing ping pong against a wall with ungodly speed. karate chopping through too much wood. breakdancing. playing the accordion. rapping to a drum machine. creating a perfect origami dragon.}
<B>__{end hobby montage}
<A>__{on bloom's shell shock face.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{is that it?}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{no. i know a lot of stuff.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{you just learned this stuff, here by yourself?}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{kinda sad.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{no. so you just thought, `so i want to learn this and this,' and you just did it? how do you plan to use all these skills?}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{i dunno. i'm not a planner. i just do stuff. here, look at this watermelon. it's a camera. you can make a pinhole camera out of anything hollowish and dark.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{it's gotta warp the image though, right?}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{no, yeah it does. that's what the taj majal taken by a fat tourist with diarrhea and a point and shoot camera can be the flattest, dullest, "here's us at the taj majal," "oh lovely lets go stick our thumbs up our asses" picture. but you can look at the most menial everyday thing, and depending on how your pinhole camera eats the light, it's warped and peculiar and imperfect. it's not reproduction, it's storytelling.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{it's a lie that tells the truth.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{i dunno about truth. a photograph is a secret about a secret. the more it tells you, the less you know.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{what's changed between now and twenty minutes ago? cause this is kinda like a conversation.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{huh. well shit.}
