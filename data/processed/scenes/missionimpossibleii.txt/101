<L>__{ext bear island}
<A>__{ethan's on the motorcycle, heading toward the gates, which a pair of security guards are frantically trying to close. billy and luther in the copter are over the island, and bank so luther can fire a grenade launcher and blow the back of ambrose's boat. the guards close the gate, ethan runs the motorcycle up the hillock and jumps the gate, over onto the bridge. ambrose follows in the suv, crashing thru the gate. they race across the bridge and the road, onto the huge greensward opposite to and similar in shape to bare island. there, with the helicopter hovering, ambrose manages to corner ethan and after they expend whatever ammunition their weapons hold, they move into each other bare handed and engage in ferocious, no holds barred combat, the helicopter hovering low enough to keep away whatever's left of ambrose's henchmen, the chopper's downdraft hitting them and flattening the grass around them. ethan prevails.}
