<A>__{he approaches tilley who's just finished racking the balls.}

<D>__{tilley.}
<A>__{he nods for tilley to go over to him. they start to walk together through the darkened areas of the pool hall.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{found this on your desk while i was going over some papers.}
<A>__{he hands the letter to tilley.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{from the irs. i never even remember seeing it. i must have left it with my other bills. i wonder what it is?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{maybe it's a refund check.}
<A>__{tilley opens the envelope and looks at the document.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{hum... says here that they haven't received my 1962 taxes. they seem to be saying that they didn't get my check for four thousand dollars.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what? it must be a clerical error.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{i can't believe they spend all that time and energy to write to me... to single me out.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what are you talking about? you didn't pay your taxes?}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{i probably forgot... people forget their taxes all the time... just slipped my mind... i got so many things on my mind.}
<C>__{tilley }
<D>__{i figured they could wait a few years... it's not like they need my money to build a bomber. you think they're waiting for my money before they dig a new road? are they all sitting there saying, 'well, it's time we went to see that guy on pimlico road... can't run this government without his four thousand dollars.'}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i figured they'd give me a little leeway. i'm going to pay them... i know i've got a debt... i just need a little leeway.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you can't mess around with the government. why don't you go to h & r block, they'll take care of your taxes for you.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{you think i'm gonna let some schmuck know all my business... have some guy pull me over the coals for spending on this and that. i need some privacy.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{taxes is serious stuff, tilley.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{i can just see that schmuck in that little tax shop telling people my business... how much i make... how much i spend... no way!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{all i can say, is you better get a lawyer or somebody to look into this, 'cos the irs, they don't fuck around.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{just what i need in my life right now... i'm in a slump and i've got the irs on me. like when something goes wrong, it's like...}
<A>__{he throws his arms up in the air in exasperation.}
