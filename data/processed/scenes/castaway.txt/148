<L>__{exterior beach wide night}
<A>__{the fire burns on the beach. chuck rushes about, piling on driftwood.}
<L>__{exterior beach closer}
<A>__{chuck darts into the jungle and returns dragging a huge log. he throws it on the fire. we see his face in the light of the fire. he is exultant. he dances. he sings at the top of his lungs. papa ooo mow mow! chuck throws another huge log on the fire. papa papa papa oooo! the log splutters and explodes, sending up a huge shower of sparks that climb and sparkle in the darkness...until they merge with the stars.}
