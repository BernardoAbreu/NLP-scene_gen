<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{barris is locked in a stall, vomiting. the door to the bathroom opens. someone enters. barris peeks through the closed stall door. it's jim brooks, whistling and holding his emmy. he places it next to the sink, unzips his fly and pisses. an agitated barris pulls his gun from his ankle holster, opens the stall door a crack, and shakily aims the gun at brooks' back.}
