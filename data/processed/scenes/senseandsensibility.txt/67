<A>__{willoughby is shaking hands with colonel brandon and sir}
<B>__{john.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{how do you do, colonel?}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{how does he do? how do you do, more like. go on in, they're waiting for you!}
<A>__{brandon looks at willoughby for a moment. he bows. willoughby bows. then brandon and sir john exit.}
<L>__{interior barton cottage parlour day}
<A>__{elinor leads in willoughby. mrs dashwood greets him with outstretched arms.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{mr willoughby! what a pleasure to see you again!}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{the pleasure is all mine, i can asstire you. i trust miss marianne has not caught cold?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{you have found out my name!}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{of course. the neighbourhood is crawling with my spies.}
<A>__{he suddenly produces a bunch of wild flowers from behind his back and offers them to marianne with a courtly, humorous bow.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{and since you cannot venture out to nature, nature must be brought to you!}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{how beautiful. these are not from the hothouse.}
<A>__{willoughby sees brandon's flowers.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{ah! i see mine is not the first offering, nor the most elegant. i am afraid i obtained these from an obliging field.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{but i have always preferred wild flowers!}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{i suspected as much.}
<A>__{elinor takes the delicate flowers from willoughby.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i will put these in water.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{our gratitude, mr willoughby, is beyond expression }
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{but it is i who am grateful. i have often passed this cottage and grieved for its lonely state and then the first news i had from lady allen when i arrived was that it was taken. i felt a peculiar interest in the event which nothing can account for but my present delight in meeting you.}
<A>__{he is merry, spirited, voluble a breath of fresh air. elinor brings back willoughby's flowers and places them next to brandon's on the side table.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{pray sit down, mr willoughby.}
<A>__{she indicates a chair but willoughby sees a book lying on marianne's footstool, picks it up and to her great delight sits down on the stool at her feet.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{who is reading shakespeare's sonnets?}
<A>__{everyone answers at once.}
<D>__{marianne elinor mrs dashwood i am. we all are. marianne.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{marianne has been reading them out to us.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{which are your favourites?}
<A>__{it is a general question but marianne gaily commandeers it.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{without a doubt, mine is 116.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments. love is not love which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove then how does it go?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{'0, no! it is an ever fixed mark.'}
<A>__{willoughby joins in the line halfway through and continues. elinor and mrs dashwood exchange glances. clearly, their contribution to this conversation will be minimal.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{'that looks on storms' or is it tempests? let me find it.}
<A>__{willoughby gets out a tiny leatherbound book.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{it is strange you should be reading them for, look, i carry this with me always.}
<A>__{it is a miniature copy of the sonnets. marianne is delighted, and, mutually astonished at this piece of synchronicity, they proceed to look up other favourites, chatting as though they were already intimates. mrs dashwood smiles at elinor with satisfaction. elinor, amused, picks up her sewing. margaret stares. willoughby and marianne are oblivious to everything but each other.}
