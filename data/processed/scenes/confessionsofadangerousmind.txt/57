<A>__{barris is drunk and in a fight. he is losing, flailing, swinging wildly. jim byrd, a middle aged, business man looking guy, in tinted glasses and sideburns, watches from the bar. eventually barris and the other brawler get thrown out of the bar. byrd takes a sip of his drink.}
<L>__{exterior bar day}
<A>__{barris sits on the curb, nursing his wounds. byrd exits the bar and casually approaches.}

<D>__{screw off, fag. don't think i haven't seen you watching me in that bar for a week now.}
<C>__{byrd}
<D>__{kind of a loner, i'd say. fairly bright. a tad anti social. mad at the world. can i buy you lunch?}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{look, there's a schoolyard half a block down. why don't you go trolling there?}
<A>__{barris gets up and starts to walk away.}
<C>__{byrd}
<D>__{i could teach you at least thirty different ways to kill a man with a single blow, mr. barris.}
<A>__{barris stops.}
<C>__{byrd }
<D>__{might help you in future bar fights. just a thought.}
<A>__{barris just stands there.}
<C>__{byrd }
<D>__{oh, and there's money in it. good money.}
