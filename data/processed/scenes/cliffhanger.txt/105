<D>__{id says this used to be your pilot.}
<P>__{(beat)}

<D>__{a hijack.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the plane was hijacked. son of a bitch }
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{oh, give me a break. your pilot lost it when the flight started going south, and he bailed }
<C>__{search pilot}
<D>__{excuse me but there's no parachute there. check it yourself.}
<A>__{before this can go on, a forensics agent runs up to stuart carrying a recorder.}
<C>__{forensics agent}
<D>__{sir we found the flight recorder it was driven twenty feet deep into a crater. it was demolished, but we salvaged the recording }
<C>__{stuart}
<P>__{(grabbing it away)}
<D>__{i've heard a thousand of these, wright whoever was at the stick is going to begin by screeching the lord's prayer and wind up screaming "oh, shit" at ground zero }
