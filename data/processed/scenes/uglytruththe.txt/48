<L>__{interior colin's office day}
<A>__{dial tone. colin hangs up the phone.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{unbelievable.}
<L>__{exterior downtown street day}
<A>__{abby and mike walk down the street.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{rule number one. never criticize.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{even if it's constructive?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{never. men are incapable of growth, change or progress. for men, self improvement ends at toilet training. rule number two. laugh at whatever he says.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what if what he's saying isn't funny?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{that's irrelevant. a fake laugh is like a fake orgasm.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{and a fake orgasm is good?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no, but a fake orgasm is better than no orgasm at all.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{a fake orgasm is no orgasm.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{only to you. you're not the only person in the room, you know. let's not be selfish.}
<A>__{abby giggles. mike is struck by the sound of her laughter.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{that was perfect. you have a perfect laugh. real or fake?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you'll never know.}
<A>__{he raises an eyebrow, impressed.}
