<L>__{exterior whitaker farm porch morning}
<A>__{nicole sits with her camera staring at a candle on the table in front of her. an aa book rests on the table. she snaps a picture of the flame and then focuses out to the grassy landing strip and the rolling hills. whip enters carrying the large plastic bottle of water from the kitchen.}
<C>__{whip}

<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{it's more than okay, whip.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{it's quiet as they let the awkward exchange pass.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i've been watching the sky change as the sun rises. beautiful.}
<P>__{(holds up the camera)}
<D>__{perfect light, i went out and took some great shots.}
<A>__{whip reaches for the camera. she hands it to him.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{lemme see that camera.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{my mom got it for me. towards the end, when she knew she wasn't gonna recover. she maxed out her credit card to buy me that camera and a lighting kit.}
<A>__{nicole takes a moment to tamp down some emotions.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{it's just so beautiful here. did you grow up here?}
<A>__{whip still holds the camera as he sits down.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{it was my grandfather's farm, my dad grew up here. he was a pilot in world war ii, flew with the 332nd. see the landing strip out there? he built that. he ran a crop duster outta here until the epa put an end to that.}
<P>__{(she nods, listening)}
<D>__{he traded the crop duster for a used cessna. he flew that damn thing all over. it's still in the barn. i was gonna sell this place after my dad died. then i got divorced...}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{and your mom?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{dead...she's dead. your dad still alive?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i'm pretty sure my father lives in colorado.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{you got no relationship with him.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{he drank. it was my mom that raised me. she was incredible.}
<A>__{nicole lights a cigarette as the memories are tough.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{she held it together for so long, i couldn't tell how sick she was. even through chemo she looked beautiful. nicole leans over and blows out the candle.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{they gave her very heavy meds for pain. dilauded, morphine, oxycontin. i started taking them with her. we would get all medicated and sit in our back yard and talk and talk and watch the sun go down. we'd be so stoned that we couldn't get up to go inside when it got dark.}
<P>__{(laughs, fights the pain)}
<D>__{i know it sounds crazy to get hooked on dope with your mom, but she was dying and we spent her last seven months together like teenagers, trading stories about boys and whatever. she loved me. whip lifts the camera and points it at nicole. she contorts her face into a sly smile. whip snaps it...she laughs.}
<B>__{a church bell swings inside a stone belfry}
<A>__{the blue sky is the perfect backdrop as we reveal...}
