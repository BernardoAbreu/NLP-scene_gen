<A>__{it's a beautiful morning. an ice cream truck makes its way down the street (playing the song the minions were singing earlier). it stops and a couple of children run to meet it. stuart opens gru's front door, having heard the commotion. two other minions approach as well. stuart spots the ice cream truck and points to it, excited.}

<D>__{oh! oh! gelato!}
<A>__{and then suddenly a mob of minions appears running for the ice cream truck alongside the group of children. the minions shove the children aside and clamor around the truck holding out their money.}
<C>__{minions}
<D>__{gelato! gelato! gelato!}
<A>__{stuart pushes himself to the top of the unruly pack and tries to maintain order.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{stopa! stopa!!}
<A>__{a hush comes over the minions.}
<C>__{stuart }
<P>__{(knocking on the truck)}
<D>__{hey ho! gelato!}
<A>__{suddenly the ice cream cone on top of the truck transforms into a large tube and extends itself above the minions. stuart offers the tube a wad of cash and attempts to order gelato, but the it begins sucking the minions into it. zup! zup! zup! one by one the minions (dozens of them, including the minion with his head still trapped in the jelly jar) are sucked into the truck until there is only one left. he tries to make a break for it, but the truck lowers a popsicle in front of him. he licks it, his tongue sticks, and he is yanked back into the ice cream cone. the it closes and the truck drives away. the children look on puzzled.}
