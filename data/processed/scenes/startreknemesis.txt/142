<L>__{interior enterprise picard's cabin night}
<A>__{picard sits at his desk, speaking quietly to someone we do not see.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i don't know if all this has made sense to you, but i wanted you to know what kind of man he was. in his quest to be more like us, he helped show us what it means to be human.}
<A>__{we see it is the now re activated b 9 sitting across from him.}
<D>__{b 9 my brother was not a human.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{no, he wasn't... but his wonder and his curiosity about every facet of human life helped all of us see the best parts of ourselves. he embraced change... because he always wanted to be more than he was. b 9 i do not understand.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{well, i hope someday you will.}
<A>__{worf interrupts on comm:}
<D>__{worf (v.o.) (on comm) captain, the hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{on my way. please notify commander riker...}
<P>__{(he stands, prepares to go)}
<D>__{... we'll talk later?}
<A>__{the b 9 does not respond. he is looking rather blankly at the padd on picard's desk. picard begins to leave when a sound stops him... humming. he turns back to the b 9. the b 9 is still looking blankly at the padd... but he's humming lightly to himself... then he begins to sing, very softly...}
<D>__{b 9 "blue skies, smiling at me, nothing but blue skies do i see."}
<A>__{then the b 9 is silent. picard watches him for a moment; great emotion playing over his features, and then goes.}
