<D>__{yes sir.}
<A>__{he fires her up, lifts off...}
<L>__{int smoking lounge, standard hotel continuous}
<A>__{carlito’s and don kim’s men have backed into opposite corners of the room, and are firing back and forth. verona crawls along the floor, gathering up what’s left of his fingers... comes across a syringe and grabs it in his teeth like a pirate’s knife. don kim stands amidst the chaos, completely unperturbed.}
<C>__{carlito}
<P>__{(from behind the bar)}
<D>__{i’ll kill you for this, chelios!}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{too late!}
<A>__{chev swoons, almost passes out... catches sight of a gun and pries it from the hand of a dead goon... he spots verona’s feet disappearing behind a wall, takes a bead and fires blowing off a set of toes to go with the fingers. an asian gangster runs up and lobs a grenade behind the bar... it bounces along and comes to rest next to carlito. carlito thinks quick, grabbing one of his goons a 265 pounder from behind...}
<C>__{carlito}
<D>__{get down!}
<A>__{he body tackles the big man onto the floor, right on top of the live grenade, and brings his weight down on top of him.}
<C>__{goon}
<D>__{thanks, boss.}
<A>__{boom! the big goon’s body absorbs the blast, which picks them both up five feet in the air... carlito, momentarily airborne, pops up from behind the bar like a jack in the box, then drops back down with a thud...}
<C>__{carlito}
<D>__{ronnie james dio...!}
<A>__{the lounge opens into a daylight drenched pool area... carlito’s helicopter drops down into view, roiling up the water... carlito makes a break for it.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{oh no you don’t...}
<A>__{chev goes after him, spinning and careening across the slick floor like a charlie chaplin drunk act, dodging bullets and blasting away...}
