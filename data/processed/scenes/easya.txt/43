<A>__{she closes the door behind them.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{my mom's an acquired taste. i know this because i've only just recently begun to appreciate her myself.}
<A>__{she gestures for him to sit down.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{welcome to my boudoir! this is where the magic happens.}
<C>__{brandon}
<P>__{(blurting out)}
<D>__{do you wanna go out with me?}
<A>__{she looks at him, strangely.}
<C>__{brandon }
<D>__{i mean, like do you want to be my girlfriend?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{brandon, just a few hours ago, you told me you were kinsey six gay.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{true. but you said i should pretend to be straight.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{well, i didn't mean with me. you're a sweet guy and all, but you're not really my type.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{you're not really my type either.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i should say not.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{okay. well, do you wanna have sex with me?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{you're serious.}
<A>__{he nervously nods.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{oh my god, dude. you totally missed my pointerior all i was saying was that }
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{no, i know what you were saying. i should play it straight until i get out of this hell and then i can be whoever i want to be. no, i got that.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{brandon, i didn't really have sex with a college guy. i just told people i did.}
<C>__{olive }
<P>__{(considers this)}
<D>__{well, actually, i just told one person and well you know how these things work.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{so, you're saying i shouldn't really have sex. i should just say i had sex with someone. a girl.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{now, you're cooking with gas.}
<A>__{it's his turn to smile slyly at her. she sees where he's going with this and instantly gets defensive.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{oh no. oh no no no no no no no no. no. really. no. no way. no. no.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{think about it. we could help each other out. you want to maintain this floozy facade. i want to not get my face pummelled weekly.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{you are on crack.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{all it would take is one good imaginary fuck and you'd be saving the bone structure of my face. think of how happy my parents would be!}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{this is not the answer. why don't you just do what i did and make someone up?}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{who would believe me?}
<P>__{(growing increasingly desperate)}
<D>__{listen, olive, i don't want to do this. i want to live in that not too distant emo world, but i still have another year of this bullshit place and i can't do it. i just can't do it.}
<P>__{(beat.)}
<C>__{brandon }
<D>__{i will pay you. i can pay you whatever you want.}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{i just don't think it would work.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{whores aren't discerning, olive. and just think you'll officially be a hooker with a heart of gold!}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i don't want your money.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{i insist.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{so, if i say yes, you're going to tell a couple of people at school and i just have to go with it? i really don't think it will work.}
<C>__{brandon}
<P>__{(his voice cracking with emotion)}
<D>__{i can make it work. i promise.}
<A>__{she sees tears forming in his eyes. she walks away from him and is silent for a long few moments.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i don't do anything half assed.}
<P>__{(spinning around to face him)}
<D>__{it'll have to be a public event. melanie bostic is having a party tomorrow night. all of your tormentors will be there. you and i are going together. you have to do everything i say and you have to tell people that i was sensational.}
<A>__{brandon wipes his tears away and is the happiest gay you've ever seen. he throws his arms around her and won't let go.}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{i can't believe you're doing this.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{afterwards, it's up to you. you're committing to something.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{just make sure you're ready to live with the consequences.}
<A>__{it seems as if that last statement was more for herself than it was for him.}
