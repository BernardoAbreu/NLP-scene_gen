<B>__{back to anderson}
<A>__{anderson looks down a long row of parked precrime ground transports. they are sleek and menacing, the black shells lumpy with dangerous gadgetry. in the distance, a police officer, holding an armful of equipment, opens the back of one of them. he looks up at anderson's approach. he puts his equipment down, and salutes.}

<D>__{sorry, officer smythe.}
<A>__{the officer buckles. anderson catches him, rolls him gently into the back of the transport. then anderson quickly reaches into the transport, and begins stuffing equipment into a duffel bag: a helmet and black uniform, the weapon glove, a folded rifle, a holographic scanner, and other equipment whose function we can only guess at. anderson looks up at a sound, echoey footsteps. they approach, then fade away. anderson places the officer's hands and legs together, then aims a nozzled cylinder at them. he shoots a spray of blue bindfoam chemical restraint, sticking the man to the floor of the transport in an adhesive glob. then he leaves the scene, running.}
