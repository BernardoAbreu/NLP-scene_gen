<L>__{30 ... w0000000sh! it flames right by them.}
<A>__{when linda opens her eyes, the elevator is hundreds of feet above them and a wall of fire is below them, closing in.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{move!}
<A>__{panicked, linda pushes matt up the ladder as she stares down at the rising fire wall. but the fire dissipates before it hits them, though a stray tongue of flames reaches up to lick the soles of her feet. they hear a terrifying moan and looks up to see the elevator peaking far above her. it slows to a stop and}
<B>__{begins to fall.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it's coming down!}
<A>__{faster and faster. coming back toward them in complete free fall. it's emergency brakes clamp down, slowing it. metal against metal. sparks flying. one of the brakes shears. then another. the elevator unseats from it's tracks, slamming against the walls as it tumbles. linda sees that the elevator is out of control, and watches as it ping pongs toward them... smashing into the access ladder, smashing into the wall. the elevator slows, but continues slamming side to side. linda cringes as the elevator crashes into the wall above them. but it jams there, stopping. they pull their heads away from wall and look up. the elevator just hangs there, suspended. there's a small crawlspace between the elevator and the ladder.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{c'mon. before it slips.}
<A>__{they begins to climb up again. matt shimmies through the tight hollow, and squeezes out the other side, followed by linda. she breathes a sigh of relief and just hangs there a moment when ... ah! something grabs her. a singed throbbing hand emerges from the darkness, gripping at her leg.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{it's him.}
<A>__{she kicks at it and sees a dark dirty face a swirl of dirt, grime and smoke with hollow eyes rise up the ladder.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{sebastian, you fuck.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{get off me.}
<A>__{sebastian pulls himself up linda's body. translucent dirty hands paving at the fabric of her clothes. linda tries to climb with this thing on her. but sebastian grabs her around the neck. she begins choking for breath. linda fights to keep her grip on the ladder... she looks down at the ten foot drop to the elevator and then... she lets go!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she and sebastian plummet through the smoky haze and slam against the top of the elevator. linda seems to hover a few above the elevator, sebastian's shadowy outline below her. matt painfully lowers himself down the ladder. but metal groans and the elevator drops another five feet. linda struggles to her feet. sebastian rises. a menacing dark figure stalking toward her. linda pushes back from him. sebastian grabs her by the hair and pulls bar over to the ladder. the elevator strains and groans.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{let go of me.}
<A>__{sebastian presses her up against the ladder. presses into her from behind. he has her trapped. his dirty hand reaches out and strokes her hair.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{remember the day we met? you were wearing a red dress and you were so pretty. now... now look at you.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{get off of her!}
<A>__{sebastian pulls her hair back and kisses her neck with his filthy, dirt smeared mouth and half burned away face.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{sebastian, stop it.}
<A>__{linda and sebastian struggle. matt reaches down to try and grab her, help her.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you fucked it all up.}
<A>__{linda looks at her feet. the last elevator emergency brake grips its cable. she grits her tooth and grabs hold of the ladder.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{go to hell.}
<A>__{linda stamps on the brake release. the elevator tumbles ... along with sebastian. it slams into the fiery abyss a hundred yards below. linda hangs, one hand holding onto the ladder, the other holding onto matt. matt pulls her back onto the ladder, using all his remaining strength.}
