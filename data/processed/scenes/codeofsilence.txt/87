<L>__{interior party night}
<A>__{a hundred people are jammed into the studio. it feels like the star wars saloon. the live musicians match the look of the party. the costumes are outrageous. everyone is dancing. eddie looks the place over. he spots diana. eddie walks over to her, grabbing a drink along the way. he sidles up to diana.}

<C>__{diana}
<D>__{all bad.}
<A>__{she is angry now, and walks away from him. eddie watches her go, and is about to follow. he sets his drink down, and turns to find a girl, luscious as hell, dressed like a frederick's wet dream, making eyes at him. she takes his bat, and gives it a long, lascivious lick.}
