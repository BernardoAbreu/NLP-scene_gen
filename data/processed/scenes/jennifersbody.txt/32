<A>__{jennifer and jonas are in the woods. jennifer efficiently whips off her top and bra and begins kissing jonas hungrily. as jonas touches her, he recoils.}
<C>__{jonas}
<D>__{you feel so warm. why are you so warm?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(firmly covering his mouth)}
<D>__{shutties!}
<A>__{she pulls off jonas' shirt and digs her nails into his arms, kissing him with renewed ferocity. the woods are dead silent. a few squirrels approach the clearing, and jonas watches them warily with one open eye as jennifer kisses him. then a deer wanders into the clearing. then a fox. the animals pause in their tracks and watch, motionless. it's an eerie, unnatural tableau. animals continue to gather.}

<D>__{jennifer! jen...}
<A>__{jennifer is annoyed.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jonas}
<D>__{look!}
<A>__{he gestures to the animals, who are watching, still as statues. a few crows alight on a nearby tree.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{mm hmm. they're waiting.}
<C>__{jonas}
<D>__{uh, okay...}
<A>__{jennifer unzips jonas's jeans and smiles, reaching down and working him with her hand. jonas moans, still eyeing the animals.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{do you miss craig?}
<C>__{jonas}
<P>__{(startled)}

<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{don't worry. you're going to see your buddy again.}
<C>__{jonas}
<D>__{you mean like in heaven someday?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she smiles and shakes her head. jonas jerks back, creeped out. he tries to pull away from jennifer, but she's too strong. she pins him to the tree. we see her jaw begin to unhinge, like some horrible snake. her eyes cloud over with blood...}
