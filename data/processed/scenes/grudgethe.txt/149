<T>__{back to the present:}
<A>__{we pan from peter to the reflection in the mirror it's not the pale, frightening kayako anymore. rather: a beautiful, young kayako with eyes filled with sorrow. we pan back to see karen standing there, instead of peter. karen slumps to the ground in front of the mirror, the revelation taking everything out of her. a beat. then:}
<D>__{that came from upstairs.}
<B>__{thump.}
<A>__{karen looks up as the sound continues. we pan over towards the stairs as a dragging sound moves across the ceiling. accompanied by a strange scraping, like plastic.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no more... please, no more...}
<A>__{she suddenly freezes, sensing something next to her. we see it now, as she turns her head, almost hidden in the darkness a pale face in the darkened hallway, staring up at the ceiling. eyes wide and rolled back, mouth yawning open in abject terror it's doug's body. he lies on his back, his top half sticking out from a niche by the stairwell. it's been right next to her all along.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{doug! no!!!}
<A>__{karen takes doug into her arms as the sounds continue above, growing closer. but it's no use he's dead. and now there's a new sound, moving down the stairs. a familiar throaty croaking sound, along with a strange skittering, like the world's biggest cockroach. karen turns to the staircase to see kayako, crawling down the stairs. still wrapped in the plastic sheeting, she moves like a wounded animal, neck hanging limply, struggling to pull herself forward her eyes locked on karen, croaking horribly karen sorrow turns to abject terror. she tries to lift doug's body and pull it to the front door. it's too heavy. and kayako is getting closer. sobbing, karen drops doug and falls back against the front door, bumping into the gas cans. the one nakagawa unscrewed tips over, spilling gasoline into the entryway. as doug's arm flops to the floor, his outstretched hand lands next to karen. she sees something clenched in his fingers his zippo lighter. realization dawns over karen as she feels the liquid spilling onto her hands. the odor is unmistakable. karen immediately reaches forward, trying to loosen doug's grip on the lighter as kayako reaches the bottom of the stairs. her broken neck makes a horrific cracking as she swivels to face karen. karen finally gets the lighter. she pushes back against the door with legs too numb to stand. her eyes drift up to see toshio, watching from the railing above, as before, his cold eyes locked on hers. karen grabs another can, and spins the lid until it pops off. she tips it onto the floor, spilling more gas. kayako doesn't seem to care. she crawls over doug's body and pulls herself through the gasoline, slowly, drawing inexorably closer karen drops the empty gas can and opens doug's lighter. she flicks it. nothing. karen tries the lighter again. and again. nothing. kayako reaches out, blood dripping from her gaping mouth the lighter catches. karen flails with her free arm and opens the front door just as kayako grabs her ankle. karen reaches outside, anchoring a hand to the door frame but she can't pull herself free, as kayako pulls herself closer, her croaking intensifying resigned, karen slowly lowers the flame to the gas can and ignites the gas! there's a sudden bright flash that overtakes the screen }
