<L>__{interior dining room day}
<A>__{jack and frank are eating lunch. frank has a tiny stack of blue cards he's perusing. he holds one out to jack.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what do you make that? paruchi?}
<A>__{jack nods. frank continues to go through the cards as he speaks.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you haven't seen susie, have you?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no. why?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{just wonder what she's up to. i never see her. makes me nervous.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she's a big girl.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, well, she's our girl now. i think we better keep an eye on her. there's trouble there.}
<P>__{(another card)}
<D>__{hey, listen to this. ethel and bert lane. married seventy five years. you believe that?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what the hell are these?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{dedications. i came up with the idea on the road. see, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room. the guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it. daniels went crazy for the idea.}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{and that's not all. last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability. like he wants to line something up. i think he's got a hard on for susie.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{frank jumps. a woman in a bright flowered gift shop dress pokes her head in.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i'm sorry to interrupt, but when i saw you sitting here, i just had to come over. florence simmons.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{uh ... frank baker. this is my brother.}
<C>__{florence simmons }
<D>__{oh, i know, i know. my husband and i saw you play last night and it's the most remarkable thing.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh. well, thank you.}
<C>__{florence simmons}
<D>__{no, i mean you.}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{i have a brother in law who looks exactly like you. exactly. you don't happen to have a huckleberry in your family tree, do you?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{afraid not.}
<C>__{florence simmons}
<D>__{well, it's frightening. you could be his twin. of course, he doesn't have your talent. musically, i mean. he sharpens things for a living. lawn mower blades, kitchen knives, anything with an edge. can imagine?}
<A>__{jack is having a hard time imagining florence simmons.}
<C>__{florence simmons}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{well, anyway, i just had to make sure there was no relation. you play wonderfully. both of you.}
<A>__{florence simmons gives a little flutter of a wave and exits.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{funny, huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{wonder if i saw him i'd think it was you?}
