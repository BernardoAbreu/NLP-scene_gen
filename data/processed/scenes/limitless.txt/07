<L>__{interior a midtown coffee shop day}
<A>__{a female hand slides a key across the counter to eddie. eddie stares in disbelief at his (now ex) girlfriend, lindy, an attractive, real looking girl, late 20's. she's dressed in a professional suit. she looks very sad.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{i don't think i can keep this.}
<A>__{eddie is broadsided. hurt.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{just like that.}
<A>__{she shoots him a look of almost intolerable sympathy.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{i was kind of under the impression you cared a little more than just }
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{if i didn't care, maybe i'd be able to stand to watch you do this.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{look, i'm going to give 90 pages to mark on friday. if you could just wait, see what he says }
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{stop. you think i don't know what you do all day? i've loved you. i know the good stuff, and i know the shit.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{and it's all shit to you now?}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{you're the one living it.}
<P>__{(sympathetically)}
<D>__{don't think i don't know it's worse for you.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{then you know i could use a friend.}
<A>__{he tries to push the key back. he cares about her, but he's also "working" her sympathy, which she instantly smells.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{don't you dare try that shit on me!}
<A>__{she pierces eddie with a look. doesn't take the key.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{well what'll work, then?}
<A>__{they both almost laugh. they know each other so well. but she looks away, steeling herself.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{i see where it's going. you'll lose your apartment. and then what? you'll move in with me }
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{not with that enthusiastic invite }
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{ and then it'll go on this way, and i will rag on you, and finally boot you out and then what? i mean, have you run the film?}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{she knew what was beckoning: the lower bunk in my childhood bedroom in newark. we'd even had sex on it once. and it was a thing to be pitied and avoided.}
<A>__{eddie sighs. drops the glib tone. looks at her, finally mustering the honesty she deserves.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{lindy. i really thought i had it in me to do something. i wasn't getting around it, but it was fucking there. and now, i, ah... don't think it is. there. anything. at all.}
<A>__{lindy looks at him, clear eyed, seeing him as he is, and loving him anyway.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{you know what...? i'd have had you move in anyway... if...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{if, what?}
<A>__{she looks away. its hard for her to admit this:}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{if it was me you wanted. and not melissa.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i never think about melissa !}
<A>__{flash!}
