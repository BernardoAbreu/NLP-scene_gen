<L>__{137. stephen's cabin night}
<A>__{stephen is with blakeney, re bandaging the younger man's stump. blakeney looks away, his eyes moving over the doctors collection of books, learned texts in french spanish, greek and latin}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{do you have a manual of exercises sir.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{exercises?}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{physical exercises, to make the left arm as powerful as the right once was.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i think that will happen with usage, at least to a certain extent.}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{but not completely. i will never be whole again, will i?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{no but you will adapt to your new situation the natural world shows us any number of examples of how that is possible.}
<A>__{blakeney bites his lip}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{you know my father was a great fighting captain. it was always his expectation i would follow in his footsteps. i worry that with this arm i will now be good for nothing but book learning and philosophy.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{ah. like me you mean.}
<C>__{blakeney}
<P>__{(becoming tearful)}
<D>__{i cannot use a sextant, cannot tie a knot or climb the rigging. cannot even dress myself. what chance to i have now of even making first lieutenant.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you have every chance. you hear me every chance. only the other day i heard the captain singing your praises. your courage, your fortitude in battle, your skill at logarithms and double elevations whatever they may be. and when you are rated lieutenant you shall have someone to tie your bootlaces for you. aye and help you with your jacket. here take my handkerchief. i believe we are summonsed to dinner.}
