<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{possibly we hear the soft backbeat of moonlight drive without lyrics. ray manzarek is meditating in yoga posture, longer hair as well, in his post graduate phase, sandals, colorful hippie shirt. but the meditation is not going well. he's shaking his head at himself, frowning.}

<D>__{let's swim to the moon un hunh let's climb thru the tide penetrate the evening that the city sleeps to hide}
<A>__{jim has crouched, digging his hand in the sand. as the grains spill out of his fist he has his eyes closed. ray pantomimes chords in the keyboard sand. all of a sudden we're in ray's pov a mystical moment. jim singing, no sound, then pure song, unadulterated by atmosphere.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{let's swim out tonight love it's our turn to try parked beside the ocean on our moonlight drive}
<A>__{jim stops, shrugs. ray looks at him a long beat. intense eyes, the manner of a man who knows what he wants and cannot be stopped.}

<C>__{jim}

<D>__{are you kidding! i could fly. you wrote that? you got others?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{a bunch. it's like i'm taking notes at a rock concert going on inside my head. i actually hear the music the spirit of the wine y'know, intoxication.}

<A>__{jim laughs, loves ray's ardor as they move along the ocean side.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{there oughta be great orgies man. like when dionysus arrived in greece, he made all the women mad, leaving their homes and dancing off in the mountains. great golden copulations in the streets of la.}
<P>__{(looks at a passing girl)}
