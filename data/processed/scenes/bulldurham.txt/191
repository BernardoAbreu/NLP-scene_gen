<D>__{this son of a bitch is throwing a two hit shutout and he's shaking me off?!}
<P>__{(to batter and umpire)}
<D>__{hey charlie, here comes the deuce.}
<A>__{nuke winds and delivers a hanging curveball. the batter takes an ungodly cut, and blasts a long home. the batter stands at the plate watching the blast... until crash shoves him toward first with a sneer. for a moment it looks like there'll be a fight but the hitter backs off and takes the home run trot as: nuke stares at the outfield wall as the batter circles the bases. crash walks to the mound.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{you told him i was throwing a deuce, right?}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{yep. he really crushed that dinger, didn't he. musta gone 450 feet... damn...}
<A>__{nuke holds out his glove says nothing. crash puts a new ball in the glove. returns to the plate. nuke gets the sign winds. delivers. batter hits a weak one hopper back to the mound. game's over.}
