<C>__{motorcycle cop}
<D>__{in the car, please.}
<A>__{phil opens the door and empty beer bottles cascade out into the road. they get into the car and the cop cuffs them together through the steering wheel and takes the car keys. then he walks back over to his bike and starts to talk into the radio.}
