<A>__{sound of her hanging up. ben hangs up slowly. he stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and carrying it folded across his arm in front of him, leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that lead to the main lobby. as he is about to go in, the doors open and a group of very old people start coming out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering to each other and helping each other out of the door and down the steps. ben holds one of the doors open for them and stands politely to one side. as they get through, ben starts to move inside. at that moment, a dozen young people, dressed as though for a high school dance, push him to one side and move past him into the lobby. he moves back against the other door, holding it open and allowing them to go in first. he smiles politely and they pay no attention to him at all. he follows them into the lobby. they move toward the front desk and he moves with them. one of the boys at the front of the group leans in and says something to the clerk behind the desk. the clerk points across the lobby and says something to him. there are the sounds of an orchestra playing some where. the group of young people passes by the desk and ben moves in behind them. he pauses at the desk and looks apprehensively at the hundreds of pigeon holes against the wall with the room numbers painted under them and the keys dangling suggestively.}
<C>__{room clerk}
<D>__{can i help you, sir!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what? oh no i'm just }
<A>__{he points vaguely in the direction of the other young people.}
<C>__{room clerk}
<D>__{are you here for an affair, sir?}
<A>__{terror and disbelief start in ben's eyes. he looks helplessly at the clerk.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{room clerk}
<D>__{the singleman party, sir?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{oh yes. the singleman party.}
<C>__{room clerk}
<D>__{it's in the main ballroom.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{ahh thank you.}
<A>__{ben backs off and turns and starts across the lobby. he puts on his jacket as he goes. he gets to the entrance to the main ballroom. he pauses at the door, looks in. what he sees: people dancing, talking, sitting, etc. he turns back toward te lobby. he stops. what he sees: the room clerk scross the lobby watching him. ben flashes a huge smile and points in toward the ballroom as though to express his joy at finding the singleman affair inside, then turns back and enters the ballroom.}
