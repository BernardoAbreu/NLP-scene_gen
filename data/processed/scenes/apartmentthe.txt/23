<L>__{interior lobby insurance building day}
<A>__{it's a quarter to nine of a gray november morning, and work bound employees are piling in through the doors. among them is bud, bundled up in a raincoat, hat, heavy muffler and wool gloves, and carrying a box of kleenex. he coughs, pulls out a tissue, wipes his dripping nose. he has a bad cold. the lobby is an imposing, marbled affair, as befits a company which last year wrote 9.3 billion dollars worth of insurance. there are sixteen elevators, eight of them marked local floors 1 18, and opposite them eight marked express floors 18 37. the starter, a uniformed valkyrie wielding a clicker, is directing the flow of traffic into the various elevators. bud joins the crowd in front of one of the express elevators. also standing there is mr. kirkeby, reading the herald tribune.}

<P>__{(hoarsely)}
<D>__{good morning, mr. kirkeby.}
<C>__{kirkeby}
<P>__{(as if he just knew him vaguely)}
<D>__{oh, how are you, baxter. they keeping you busy these days?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{yes, sir. they are indeed.}
<P>__{(he sniffs)}
<A>__{the elevator doors open, revealing the operator. she is in her middle twenties and her name is fran kubelik. maybe it's the way she's put together, maybe it's her face, or maybe it's just the uniform in any case, there is something very appealing about her. she is also an individualist she wears a carnation in her lapel, which is strictly against regulations. as the elevator loads, she greets the passengers cheerfully.}

<D>__{morning, mr. kessel morning, miss robinson morning, mr. kirkeby morning, mr. williams morning, miss livingston morning, mr. mckellway morning, mr. pirelli morning, mrs. schubert }
<A>__{interspersed is an occasional "morning, miss kubelik" from the passengers.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{morning, mr. baxter.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{morning, miss kubelik.}
<A>__{he takes his hat off he is the only one. the express is now loaded.}
<C>__{starter}
<P>__{(working the clicker)}
<D>__{that's all. take it away.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(shutting the door)}
<D>__{watch the door, please. blasting off.}
