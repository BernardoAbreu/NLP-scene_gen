<L>__{interior arkleseizure temple continuous}
<A>__{zaphod opens the huge doors inside the large nostril arches. a rush of air blows the mist past ford, trillian and arthur a few steps behind. they stop. a congregation of worshipers faces front where humma kavula stands behind a podium. he's a humanoid wearing a white robe and night vision sun glasses.}
<C>__{humma kavula}
<D>__{the handkerchief is coming, beloveds. are you ready? let us pray that the almighty will exhale a breath of compassion on us.}
<A>__{instead of bowing, they all point their noses heavenward. zaphod marches down the center aisle while humma prays.}
<C>__{humma kavula }
<D>__{almighty arkleseizure, we lift our noses, clogged and unblown in reverence to you.}
<A>__{zaphod stops a few feet away from humma's chair.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{hello, humma.}
<B>__{on ford and arthur}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{that's humma kavula? i thought he was just using a swear word.}
<C>__{ford}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{humma kavula was his opponent in the election. something happened during the campaign. zaphod never forgave him.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what was it?}
<A>__{ford shrugs. humma looks up, sees zaphod, smiles.}
<C>__{humma kavula}
<P>__{(wrapping up the prayer)}
<D>__{send the handkerchief, lord, so that it may wipe us clean. we ask this in your precious holy name...}
<C>__{congregation}
<D>__{achoo.}
<A>__{and they all sneeze. akin to crossing himself, humma raises a hand to his nose, then down again.}
<C>__{humma kavula}
<D>__{bless you.}
