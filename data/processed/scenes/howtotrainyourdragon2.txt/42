<A>__{(scene 2500 one true alpha) hiccup looks back at drago, now issuing commands from the top of the bewilderbeast's head.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{do something!}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{we need to get those two apart.}
<A>__{hiccup flies toothless past a flag pole tears a strip of the flag. the bewilderbeast blasts in their direction, barely missing them as they disappear around the back of a mountain.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{we gotta block him out, toothless. do you trust me, bud?}
<A>__{toothless coos, allowing hiccup to blindfold him with the flag. hiccup calms him with a touch.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{we can do this. you and me. as one.}
<A>__{hiccup splays toothless' mechanical tail. toothless responds, matching the move with the natural half.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{that's it. now let's try this one more time!}
<A>__{they peel around the other side of the mountain, heading back toward drago and bewilderbeast, passing astrid and the cheering vikings on the ground.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{take them down, babe!}
<A>__{the viking roar in support as hiccup and toothless race past. valka watches with pride as her son hurtles towards drago and the alpha.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{go get `em.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{take control of it!}
<A>__{the bewilderbeast's hiss becomes a furious roar, but to no avail. hiccup clamps his hands over toothless' ear plates, muffling the alpha's commands.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{shut it out, toothless!}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{stop them!}
<A>__{the bewilderbeast blasts!}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{toothless suddenly pulls up, arcing over drago's head! drago laughs, victorious, then pauses in shock. drago's pov: as toothless climbs inverted through the sky, the blindfold falls free, revealing an empty saddle. drago whirls around, wide eyed, to see... hiccup zooming toward him, his wing suit deployed, and his dragon blade trailing zippleback gas. drago swipes but misses him. hiccup clicks the lighter and ignites the gas, blasting drago off his bewilderbeast with a scream. drago plummets, breaking his fall against the massive dragon's spines and landing hard on the ground, his bullhook landing just out of reach. the bewilderbeast whips its tail, trying to swat down hiccup.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{not again.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{toothless! it's now or never!}
<A>__{toothless pops open his dorsal blades, arcs skyward, and rejoins hiccup just before colliding with the alpha's tail.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{come on, bud!}
<A>__{together again, they speed along the length of the thrashing tail...}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{hold on!}
<A>__{and shoot past the tip of the tail, narrowly making it!}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{yeah! we did it!}
<A>__{they arc through the sky and land a few paces from drago, kicking up a trail of dust. battered and weary, drago reaches for his bullhook. hiccup extends and fires up his dragon blade, hurling it like a javelin, and sticking it in the ground between drago and his weapon, singeing his outstretched hand.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{agghh!}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{hold him there toothless!}
<A>__{toothless snarls a warning, ready to blast.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{it's all over now.}
<A>__{but the cloud of dust settles, revealing the bewilderbeast, rising behind hiccup, ready to blast him instead.}
<C>__{drago}
<P>__{(grinning knowingly)}
<D>__{or is it?}
<A>__{hiccup spins around, alarmed, as a rush of water thunders up the bewilderbeast's throat.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{oh, no!}
<A>__{it blasts, but toothless leaps into the way, shielding hiccup beneath him. the freezing explosion envelops them both. drago laughs to himself as valka lands her baby dragon and rushes to the icy explosion, hammering away at it desperately.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{no! no...}
<A>__{on astrid and gobber, watching from a distance, horrified. as valka pounds at the ice, a glows forms from deep within. she realizes what is about to happen and backs away. a blast thunders from inside the ice, shattering it. toothless emerges from the debris, revealing hiccup curled safely under his wings. toothless is steaming, his black skin glowing blue with rage, his split dorsal blades searing with blue heat, a glow emanating from his flared nostrils. he turns back to hiccup, to check if he's unharmed, then turns his full attention back to the bewilderbeast. he leaps out of the crater and lands upon an ice spire, roaring ferociously. the bewilderbeast bellows back at this affront. toothless unleashes a salvo of plasma into the bewilderbeast's face, not letting up.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{he's challenging the alpha!}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{to protect you.}
<A>__{the bewilderbeast roars at this act of insubordination. toothless fires back, time and again, fully in control. the alpha thrashes his tusks through the ice, trying to smash toothless, but he deftly spring from spire to spire, continuing his unrelenting attack. in the midst of the mayhem, the horde of commandeered dragons both berk's and valka's break free from the control to witness toothless' retaliation. toothless lands protectively by hiccup and valka, commanding the dragons to shift sides. the follow, amassing behind toothless. seeing this, drago panics and rushes toward the bewilderbeast.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{no, no, no, no! fight back! fight! fight!}
<A>__{drago clambers up the bewilderbeast's tusk, totally unhinged.}
<C>__{drago }
<P>__{(to the defecting dragons)}
<D>__{what's the matter with you?}
<A>__{the berkians swell in to show their unified support. drago fumes as hiccup and toothless fly up together onto an ice spire.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{now do you get it? this is what it is to earn a dragon's loyalty.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{let this end now.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{never! come on!}
<A>__{he hammers the bewilderbeast, spurring it into a charge. toothless calls over his shoulder, commanding the dragons to ready themselves. he then blasts the bewilderbeast, mid charge. suddenly, skullcrusher fires. followed by another, and another. hiccup looks around, amazed to see the flock of dragons opening fire on drago and his bewilderbeast. they've started a rebellion. drago is forced to hide from the fiery barrage by taking cover in the tall spines of the giant's crown.}
<C>__{drago }
<D>__{fight! blast them!}
<A>__{his prosthetic arm is blasted clean off by one of his own armored dragons. the bewilderbeast rears back to cover them all in ice, but toothless lets loose a powerful shot. the bewilderbeast's head is knocked backward by a blue flame fireball. as the smoke clears, one of its massive tusks falls to the ground, sheared clean off. drago glares at toothless. toothless roars commandingly, calling an end to the fight.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{the alpha protects them all.}
<A>__{overwhelmed and overpowered, the bewilderbeast yields to the new alpha and heeds toothless' command, retreating into the sea in an explosive splash. the berkians cheer in victory! as the smoke clears, hiccup and toothless see nothing but bubbles on the waves to mark their disappearance. no sign of the bewilderbeast... or drago. toothless hops down from the spire, cooling off, as people celebrate all around them. all of the dragons berk's, valka's, even drago's land around toothless. cloudjumper bows to toothless, starting a wave of bows, acknowledging their new alpha. toothless looks around, surprised, then lets out a majestic roar. the assembled dragons join in, roaring in tribute. toothless turns to hiccup as he approaches.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{you never cease to amaze me, bud. thank you.}
<A>__{toothless gurgles and licks hiccup's face. hiccups squeals, trying to get away.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{toothless! you know that doesn't wash out.}
<A>__{the crowd laughs. all around them, berk's dragons reunite with their vikings.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{stormfly!}
<A>__{stormfly bounds into astrid.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{oh, give me a cuddle, grumpy!}
<A>__{grump lands on top of gobber, flattening him. relieved to the point of tears, snotlout and fishlegs race towards the expectant ruffnut...}
<C>__{fishlegs}
<D>__{who's my little princess?}
<A>__{... and then right past her to embrace their dragons.}
<C>__{fishlegs }
<D>__{i missed you so much!}
<C>__{snotlout}
<D>__{don't you ever leave again, hookfang!}
<A>__{ruffnut grumbles, dejected. barf dips his head in to console her.}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{oh barf!}
<A>__{she hugs him. belch looms in for some affection, but ruffnut pushes him away...}
<C>__{ruffnut }
<D>__{not you.}
<A>__{and into tuffnut who glowers back at her. hiccup smiles, taking in the happy reunions. skullcrusher approaches him, without an owner to reunite with. hiccup pets him, as eret approaches.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{that was some pretty fine dragon wrangling back there. you'd make a good trapper.}
<A>__{before hiccup can respond, skullcrusher nuzzles eret affectionately. eret chuckles and gently strokes him.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{y'know, skullcrusher's gonna need somebody to look after him now.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{me?}
<A>__{hiccup nods reassuringly. eret looks at skullcrusher, pausing to consider it.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{i'd be honored.}
<A>__{valka walks up to her son, bursting with pride.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{your father... he'd be every bit as proud as i am.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{thank you. i'm really glad you're here, mom.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{and here i will stay.}
<A>__{toothless arrives, purring at valka's touch as astrid strides toward hiccup, beaming proudly.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{see? i told you it was in here.}
<A>__{she places her hand upon his chest, then quickly pokes the dorsal fin button, popping it open. she giggles.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{ha, ha. still doing that one? that's hilarious.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{come here, you.}
<A>__{he scoops astrid close and pulls her into a kiss. gobber covers a gawking boy's eyes.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{ooh.}
<A>__{gothi, the elder, taps hiccup's shoulder, interrupting the romantic moment. she gestures for hiccup to kneel. he does so, respectfully. using ash from a heap of burnt wreckage, gothi traces a viking symbol onto hiccup's forehead. she bows. hiccup stands, meeting gobber's proud, smiling eyes. gobber turns to the silent crowd and throws up his arms.}
<C>__{gobber }
<D>__{the chief has come home!}
<A>__{the berkians erupt with cheers and applause as hiccup takes in the moment, acknowledging the weight of responsibility now upon him. toothless throws back his head and blasts in celebration, spurring all other dragons to follow suit, lighting up the sky in a spectacular display.}
