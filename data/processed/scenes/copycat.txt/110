<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{ruben: taking the hills fast. the man: steps out into the hall. helen: she has run back the length of the hall to her}

<A>__{the man starts to follow, not fast, but with terrifying}
<B>__{sureness... the police scanner suddenly comes up loud. he hesitates.}
<A>__{helen: her remote controls in hand switches on tv sets, lamps, etc. the man: he starts to move again, toward where he believes she is. he is passing a window, when the curtains suddenly draw, right beside him. he pauses again, looks down and we and he we see the street scene: burt and neighbors trying to}
