<L>__{exterior house day}
<A>__{solara screeches the car to a halt outside the smoking wreckage of the besieged house. she runs from the vehicle to where eli's sword lies in the dirt and grabs it up.}
<L>__{exterior road dusk}
<A>__{solara races down the road in the car, pedal to the metal.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{come on, come on...}
<A>__{eventually, she sees him. at first just a dot on the horizon. but unmistakably eli. by now, she'd know him anywhere. suddenly the engine splutters. she checks the fuel gauge; the needle deep in the red. she pounds the wheel in frustration.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{no... no!}
<A>__{the car grinds to a halt, dead. she flings open the door and leaps out of the vehicle, rushing after eli on foot. on eli. as always, his pace steady and slow. the sun directly ahead of him as it sets on the horizon. headed always west. solara is running up behind him, a hundred yards back.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{eli! eli!}
<A>__{he doesn't stop or look back. just keeps on walking. she finally catches up with him, breathing hard, exhausted.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{eli...}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{thought you'd gone back to town.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i can't go back there. eli, i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{for what? i betrayed you! i gave them the book!}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you did what you believed you had to.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you're not mad at me?}
<B>__{beat.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i forgive you.}
<A>__{she continues walking alongside him. trying to process this. this kind of compassion is totally foreign to her. she holds out the sword, offering it to eli by way of atonement.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{here. i thought you might still need this.}
<A>__{eli seems appreciative that she would think to return it to him. he takes it and slings it over his shoulder.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what are you going to do now?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{same as always. keep heading west.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{why? i mean, you don't have the book any more.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{but i still have my faith.}
<A>__{they walk on together, into the sunset.}
