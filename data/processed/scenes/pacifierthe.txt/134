<C>__{principal claire }
<P>__{(a long, severe stare)}

<C>__{rincipal claire }
<D>__{buy you a drink, sailor?}

<D>__{you look nice today.}
<C>__{principal claire}
<D>__{this old thing? well, you never know who you're going to run into.}
<A>__{she smiles. he smiles back... suddenly, there's a commotion: murney is marching todd towards them, dragging him by the ear. principal claire sighs "not again." in one move, shane leaps over the table. principal claire watches him leap:}
<C>__{principal claire }
<D>__{... love it when he does that.}
<A>__{murney shoves todd forward.}
<C>__{murney}
<D>__{i've had it. i just caught this boy dancing under the bleachers like some kind of bavarian fruitcake.}
<A>__{murney gets up in shane's face.}
<C>__{murney }
<D>__{i want this freak outta my school and into treatment. somebody needs to give this punk a talking to...}
<C>__{todd}

<C>__{murney}
<D>__{you got something to say? boy?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yeah. yeah i do. i quit, murney.}

<D>__{winners never quit, boy. what're you so scared of, freak?}
<A>__{the students snicker. todd looks, intimidated. then:}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i am not scared. i... i want to sing.}
<A>__{silence. no one's sure they heard him right. todd pulls out a stack of sound of music flyers and hands them out. todd is on the poster in his rolf costume. principal claire takes one: she laughs, now it all makes sense.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{i'm in sound of music. it opens friday...}
<C>__{murney}
<D>__{a musical? you're blowing off wrestling for a musical? (to shane:) this is what happens when there's no man in the house.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{there is a man in my house me. (murney turns:) let's get one thing clear. i'm not quitting cause i hate wresting. i'm quitting because you're a bad coach. you suck. the whole team wants to quit. i'm the only one with the guts to do it.}
<B>__{m}
<A>__{urney looks over at the team. they look to the ground sheepishly, todd's telling the truth. murney looks around, humiliated, furious }
<C>__{urney}
<D>__{so you're a tough guy now?}
<A>__{murney takes one step towards todd shane steps between them, protecting him.}
<C>__{murney }
<D>__{stay out of this, baby sitter!}
<A>__{murney glares at him face to face. so calm, it's scary}
<C>__{s}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{you said you wanted to wrestle. you win. let's do it.}
<A>__{everyone is watching. murney did not expect to be called out. his voice cracks then he regains his calm:}
<C>__{murney}
<D>__{after school. the gym. your ass is mine.}
<A>__{he storms out. there is a stunned moment and then a mob of students, and a lot of cute girls, swarm todd, taking flyers. shane gives todd a proud thumbs up. a quick series of shots: of students whispering to other students, passing notes: a kid opens a note it reads: "murney's getting his ass kicked. 3:00."}
