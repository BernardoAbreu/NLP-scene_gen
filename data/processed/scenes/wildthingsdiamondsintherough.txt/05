<L>__{exterior blue bay high diving pool day}
<A>__{the bright florida sunshine washes down on packed bleachers by the side of the massive diving pool, where a diving meet is in full swing...}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{blue bay high school would like to welcome all participating diving teams from the tri county region...}
<A>__{breathtaking beauties from teams all over the region, in their school colored bikinis, are scattered around the pool area. but all eyes are on the home team. masturbatory fantasies abound as the blue bay girls' diving team runs through stretches... and as exquisite as these girls are, they pale in comparison to absolutely sweet marie, stunning in her nearly see through white bathing suit.}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{first up, district champion marie clifford...}
<A>__{the crowd cheers, watching marie edge out to the diving platform twenty feet above. jenny right behind, waits on the ladder... jay clifford, marie's chisel jawed stepfather in his late thirties, focuses a digital video camera on marie from the front row of the bleachers...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{c'mon now baby, you can do it...}
<A>__{marie just rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{your stepfather's just got a lot invested in the team.}
<A>__{marie looks at her stepfather, nods tentatively, but then notices the incongruous figure of elena, sidling up to him...}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(to marie)}
<D>__{just try to keep those legs together.}
<C>__{elena }
<D>__{shouldn't be a problem for miss teen virgin.}
<A>__{jay looks round, lowers the camera when he comes face to face with the world's hottest towel girl...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{you're mr. clifford, right? as in clifford construction?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i am, yes, but...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{i'd love to see one of your erections...}
<A>__{whoa. jay's lost for words as he diverts his attention to the platform where marie stands perfectly still before stepping into the air. it's a spectacular sight as the beautiful marie completes a double back flip, entering the water with near perfect form. she quickly resurfaces, climbs out of the pool and exchanges high fives with her teammates before crossing to jay.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{nice take off, gotta work on the landing...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{i can't do any better...}
<A>__{jay shakes a finger at her, silences her immediately.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{no such word as 'can't. now do it again. only better...}
<A>__{marie takes a deep breath, approaches the ladder once more. as she's about to start the arduous climb, elena hands her a towel...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{bet you choke.}
<A>__{stops marie in her tracks.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{what's your major malfunction?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{just wanted to make a wager. between best friends.}
<A>__{marie just starts to climb the ladder to the high dive platform.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{you blow this dive, i get those diamonds of yours.}
<A>__{marie stops, looks down on elena from the fifth rung of the ladder, shakes her head...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{how'd you know about my inheritance?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{talk of the town, birthday girl. today's the day, right?}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{and what, pray tell, are you willing to wager when i win?}
<A>__{elena thinks for a second, glances back at jay with a big smile.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{i will stay away from your stepfather. you make it, i won't be your new stepmom anytime soon. whattya say?}
<A>__{marie just stands there incredulous for a moment.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{take your sorry ass back to the swamps.}
<A>__{she ascends the ladder, leaving elena behind...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{choke!}
<A>__{marie clambers up onto the high dive platform, tries to focus on the task at hand. but can't help but notice her nemesis below, walking slowly, seductively, up to jay, intoxicating him... marie blocks out the distraction, concentrates at the task at hand, stepping to the edge of the platform and the 20 foot drop looming beyond... she slides a ring off her finger, kisses it for luck. it's an odd design. four curved gold ridges, just ready to hold a diamond... she throws the ring into the pool ahead of her, the gold glinting in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water, and a split second before it breaks the surface, marie is airborne... she twists magnificently through the air, a sight of breathtaking beauty. thank god this is in slow motion. and as she gets ever closer to the water's surface, she tucks, does one last back flip, straightening out at the last possible instant, slicing through the water with nary a splash. marie surfaces to roaring applause. treading water, she can't help but watch her jay's smiling face in the bleachers...}
