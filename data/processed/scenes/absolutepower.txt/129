<L>__{exterior jogging park day}
<A>__{luther, standing by the edge of the jogging path, studying the runners. now he registers something: and smiles. the woman in her mid thirties as she comes jogging along. she runs well. luther. an imperceptible straightening of his clothes. the jogger. we realize who she is: the little girl in the photo on luther's dining room table. all grown up. now her face registers something: his presence. her eyes go down to the path, she increases her speed. luther. waving, calling out.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{kate.}
<P>__{(as she runs on)}
<D>__{kate.}
<A>__{she slows, hesitates, stops. kate, hands on hips, breathing deeply, moving to the edge of the path as he approaches. the river flows behind them. runners pass by. beat.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{probably too late for me to take it up.}
<A>__{she says nothing he gestures toward the path.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{the jogging.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{ahh.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{dumb way to start this, i guess.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{wanted to talk to you.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{about?}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{believe it or not, the weather.}
<P>__{(as she waits)}
<D>__{nights are starting to get cold.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{that happens this time of year.}
<A>__{luther speaks quickly now, his voice low.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{i was thinking of maybe relocating. someplace with a kinder climate.}
<P>__{(nothing shows on her face)}
<D>__{i just wanted to check it out with you first...}
<P>__{(still nothing)}
<D>__{... you're the only family i've got.}
<A>__{and on that kate speaks quickly now, her voice low.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{luther, you don't have me.}
<A>__{the last words in this world he wanted to hear, but you can't tell from his face.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{kate }
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{ you know what it's like being the only kid in show and tell who got to talk about visiting day?}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{this move i'm talking permanent, you understand.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{we don't see each other anyway we haven't seen each other since mom died and that's a year.}
<P>__{(a step toward him)}
<D>__{look, you chose your life. you had that right. you were never around for me. fine. but i have no plans to be around for you.}
<A>__{and now she stops, turns away toward the path luther can say nothing, watches her then she spins back }
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(louder now)}
<D>__{ wait a minute you're lying about something, aren't you? }
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{ no }
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{ are you active again? is that why you're here now?}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{ no }
<A>__{kate moves in close now }
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{ i don't believe you }
