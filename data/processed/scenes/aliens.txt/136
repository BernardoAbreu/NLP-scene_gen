<L>__{interior operations minutes later}
<A>__{everyone, including bishop, is crowded at the window, intently watching the ap station which is a dim silhouette in the mist. suddenly a column of flame, like an acetylene torch, jets upward from the complex at the base of the cone.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{that's it. see it? emergency venting.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{how long until it blows?}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{i'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours. the blast radius will be about thirty kilometers. about equal to ten megatons.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{we got problems.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{i don't fucking believe this. do you believe this?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{and it's too late to shut it down?}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{i'm afraid so. the crash did too much damage. the overload is inevitable, at this pointerior}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{oh, man. and i was gettin' short, too! four more weeks and out. now i'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock. it ain't half fair, man!}
<C>__{vasquez}
<D>__{hudson, give us a break.}
<A>__{they watch as another gas jet lights up the fog shrouded landscape.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(to hicks)}
<D>__{we need the other drop ship. the on one the sulaco. we have to bring it down on remote, somehow.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{how? the transmitter was on the apc. it's wasted.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(pacing)}
<D>__{i don't care how! think of a way. think of something.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{think of what? we're fucked.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what about the colony transmitter? that up link tower down at the other end. why can't we use that?}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{i checked. the hard wiring between here and there was severed in the fighting.}
<A>__{ripley is wound up like a dynamo, her mind spinning out options, grim solutions.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{well then somebody's just going to have to go out there. take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{oh, right! right! with those things running around. no way.}
<C>__{bishop}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i will go.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{i'm really the only one qualified to remote pilot the ship anyway. believe me, i'd prefer not to. i may be synthetic but i'm not stupid.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{all right. let's get on it. what'll you need?}
<C>__{vasquez}
<D>__{listen. it's stopped.}
<A>__{they listen. nothing. an instant later comes the high pitched trilling of a motion sensor alarm. hicks looks at the tactical board.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{well, they're into the complex.}
