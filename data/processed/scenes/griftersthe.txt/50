<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{ecu, roy in a hospital bed, with more color in his face, breathing more normally. he begins to react to the sound of people speaking.}
<C>__{myra }
<D>__{no, really, you're roy's mother? that's impossible!}
<C>__{lilly }
<D>__{not quite. but i'm not sure who you are, mrs... langtry, was it?}
<A>__{roy's eyes open, he looks toward the voices.}
<C>__{myra }
<D>__{i'm roy's friend.}
<A>__{wide shot, lilly and myra facing one another across the foot of roy's bed, in a two bed hospital room. (the old man in the other bed sleeps through the scene.) neither woman is yet aware that roy's awake. lilly looks myra up and down, with obvious contempt.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{yes. i imagine you're lots of people's friend.}
<A>__{myra moves one pace to the side, studying lilly's face.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{oh, of course, now that i see you in the light, you're plenty old enough to be roy's mother.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(sweet smile)}
<D>__{aren't we all?}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(very weak, but amused)}
<D>__{play nice. don't fight.}
<A>__{the women, startled, both move toward roy, one on each side of the bed. three shot, myra and lilly both leaning over to look down at roy's sleepy face.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{darling!}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{roy. you're going to be all right.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{sure i am. what made you turn up, after all these years?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i'm working down in san diego. just for a few weeks.}
<P>__{(awkward laugh)}
<D>__{thought i'd drop in on my long lost son.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{nice to see you.}
<P>__{(turns to myra)}
<D>__{what am i doing in here?}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{you were bleeding inside, honey. remember that bruise you had?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you called the doctor, huh?}
<C>__{myra}
<P>__{(reluctant)}
<D>__{well, no, roy. your mother found you.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(tossing it away)}
<D>__{oh, yeah?}
<P>__{(very casual, to lilly)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(back to myra)}
<D>__{how long do they say i'm in here?}
<A>__{myra's willing to fight with lilly, but roy's attitude toward his mother makes her uncomfortable.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{roy... your mom saved your life.}
<A>__{roy turns his head, gives lilly an ironic smile. lilly waits, holding herself in.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{yeah? only one life?}
<A>__{she nods, accepting that, but then responds.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{second time i gave it to you.}
<A>__{roy gives her a cold smile, then turns to myra for the ironic explanation.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i was kind of... inconvenient... for lilly.}
<A>__{lilly has nothing but contempt for myra. to be humiliated in front of myra and by her son is the worst thing that could happen to her. she makes as dignified an exit as she can.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{well... you're all right now, i guess. i have to get down to the track.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(reluctant, but it's necessary)}
<D>__{thanks, uh, lilly.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(awkward laugh)}
<D>__{don't mention it.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i guess i owe you my life.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(faint smile)}
<D>__{you always did.}
<A>__{lilly exits. myra looks after her, curious.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{"down to the track?"}
<A>__{roy will not talk about this, with anyone. his response is cold, closing the subject.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{her job.}
<C>__{myra}
<P>__{(bright smile)}
<D>__{i want to know everything about you.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(easy grin)}
<D>__{you do. and once i'm out of here, i will remind you of the best parts.}
<A>__{they smile flirtatiously at one another, both with their minds on other things.}
