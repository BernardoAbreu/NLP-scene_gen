<A>__{foam sprays from her bow as the albatross slices through the swells.}

<A>__{tod exits the head with a worried look on his face. he grabs chuck by the arm and pulls him aside. morale is extremely low.}

<D>__{have a nice time in curacao, did you tod?}
<A>__{alice gets up and moves to her medicine chest. tod starts to pull up his shorts.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{not so fast.}
<A>__{she pulls out a menacingly large looking hypodermic needle. tod's embarrassment turns to alarm.}
<L>__{exterior deck later}
<A>__{the crew stand in line, pissed. lawford and george man the deck with skipper and exchange amused looks. the door opens and chris exits, red faced, rubbing his backside. he glares at tod who sits on the paint locker.}

<D>__{way ta go valentino. i never even copped a feel in curacao.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{yeah well, your sexual orientation is not my problem.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{man, is there a social disease you haven't had?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{so much for vestal virgins.}
<A>__{lawford swings up a pair of binoculars. a vessel under power is coming up fast behind them. he holds the binocs out to skipper.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{what do you make of that?}
<A>__{skipper turns and looks.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{the ship pulls along the port side, keeping a couple hundred yards between them. the boys move to the rail. george sees them first.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{jesus. she's got guns.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{she's cuban.}
<A>__{everyone becomes alarmed. even alice looks concerned. suddenly a puff of smoke discharges from the gun boat.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{get down! everybody down!!}
<A>__{the entire crew hit the deck as a shell rockets across the bow exploding in the water.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{jesus, we're americans!!! we're americans!!!}
<A>__{skipper grabs the american flag and starts waving it.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{jesus, they're gonna sink us!!}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{bill drop everything. do it now!}
<A>__{the crew scrambles for the rigging, frantically dropping sail.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(hitting each word)}
<D>__{who the hell do they think they are?}
<A>__{as the sail comes down, the albatross slows to a stop. the cubans inch closer and begin speaking over a loud speaker in spanish. the seas are high and the two ships rise and fall with the large swells between them.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{they want us to identify ourselves.}
<A>__{chuck returns with a bull horn.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{tell them we're the american school ship, albatross.}
<A>__{george replies in spanish over the bull horn. the cubans answer.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{they think we're carrying cuban refugees.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{skipper, they mean to board us.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{not a chance. remind them that according to the geneva convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.}
<A>__{another exchange between george and the cubans. the crew lay flat on the deck, terrified.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{they say they are acting on the direct authority of fidel castro.}
<A>__{skipper defiantly swings up onto the gunnel rail. the cuban captain gives an order and one of his sailors jumps into the turret of the anti aircraft guns and swivels around pointing both barrels at the albatross. skipper stands firm, between the shrouds. silence. a standoff.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{tell 'em to come aboard.}
<A>__{george sends the return message. there is a pause, then the murmurs of the relieved crew. skipper swings down but never takes his eyes off the gunboat.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(to crew)}
<D>__{we've come a long way gentlemen. but this is no time for heroes. i know you're much more, but i need you to be boys right now. that's an order. now scatter and find your passports.}
