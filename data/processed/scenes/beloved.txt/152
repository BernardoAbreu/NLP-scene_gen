<L>__{interior mrs. garner's bedroom a day remembered.}
<A>__{mrs. garner is sick in bed with a goiter. sethe enters with some soup.}
<C>__{mrs. garner}
<D>__{i don't think i can swallow that. too thick. i'm sure it's too thick.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{want me to loosen it up with a little water?}
<C>__{mrs. garner}
<D>__{no. take it away. bring me some cool water, that's all.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{yes ma'am...}
<A>__{sethe helps her drink a glass of cold water.}
<C>__{mrs. garner}

<P>__{(drinks)}

<C>__{mrs. garner}
<D>__{good. that's a mercy. i know he's no mr. garner. but after he died, i had no else to turn to. i would've had to sell one. it wasn't even enough selling paul f. and in my condition. i needed help. people said i shouldn't be alone here with nothing but negroes. and he is a learned man being a schoolteacher...}
<A>__{as sethe fills mrs. garner's basin with fresh water, she looks out the window and sees: schoolteacher outside with his students, we notice he wears a very distinctive hat as mrs. garners description continues;}
<C>__{mrs. garner}
<D>__{...i know his ways might be a little more strict but as long as the men do as they're told i'm sure it'll be fine. all right, i'm through.. talking makes me tired.}
