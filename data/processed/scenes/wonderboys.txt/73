<D>__{i'm having a really good time, professor tripp.}
<A>__{grady glances over, sees james burrowing into the ziploc.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i'm really happy for you, james. but do me a favor, will you? lay off my dope. that stuff's not for amateurs.}
<A>__{james looks at ziploc as grady fiddles with the heat}
<B>__{lever.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i just wanted a little sip.}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(squinting at him)}
<D>__{i just wanted a little sip? tell me, james, exactly what point was it that you turned into serpent boy?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.}
<A>__{grady stops with the heater, glances over at james, whose face bears not the slightest trace of irony.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{jesus...}
<P>__{(thinking, then. . . )}
<D>__{look, james, you appear to possess like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. however, i 'think it's best if, for the moment at least}
<P>__{(taking the ziploc)}
<D>__{...we abstain.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{you're mad at me, aren't you?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{you're mad because i shot your girlfriend's dog.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{it wasn't her dog. it's her husband's }
<P>__{(stopping)}
<D>__{who said anything about girlfriend?}
<A>__{james eyes shift slowly, as if to 'say: who are you kidding?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{okay, james, i wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. even though poe and i weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. still, the fact remains that i'm the one who took you up into the chancellor's bedroom. i'm the one who has to take the blame. i don't know what the hell i was thinking.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{sure you do. you were thinking: 'that's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' you were thinking 'i can't let that kid get on. the bus alone he might never get on the bus again.' you were thinking: 'i've got to find a way to distract this kid. ' so you did. it was in its way a noble act.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{thanks for the halo, james, but i've . never done that much thinking ahead in my" life ever.}
<A>__{james looks out the window, pondering this.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{so, why did you take me up there?}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(feeling for the heat again)}
<D>__{i don' t know, james . i don' t know why i do half the things i do. who does?}
<P>__{(looking over)}
<D>__{why do you wear that coat?}
<A>__{james looks down, a little defensive.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{it's warm.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{james, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.}
<A>__{james just blinks, no ready answer available.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{that's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{because of my coat?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.}
<C>__{james leer}
<P>__{(smirking)}
<D>__{jealous? of me?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{not you. your talent.}
<A>__{james' face hardens. he looks away.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{you're lying.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{the hell i am.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{yes you are. my stuff stinks. i know it. you said so yourself.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i never said that.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{yes you did. last night. to your friend crabtree. "is he any good?" he said. and you said: "not yet he isn't." i heard you myself.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i didn't mean it that way.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{it's okay, professor tripp. carrie, howard, the others they 're right. my stories are annoying. they go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and }
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{shut up, james. you're annoying. carrie and howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? the entire class combined including the lovely hannah green has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?}
<A>__{james stares blankly at grady, then turns his face to the window. he ponders grady's words, the praise inherent in them. a hint of pleasure glints in his eyes.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{but, last night...}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{who cares what . i said last night, james i i was drunk, i was stoned. i'd been bitten by a dog. my wife had left me. how 'bout cutting me some slack?}
<C>__{james leer}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{and don't be so goddamn sensitive. who cares what anybody thinks anyway? you want to .be a good writer? you want to be a great writer? then stop giving a damn what other people think. most of them haven't thought in .years.}
<A>__{james turns, studies grady's face as it flickers in the first headlights of the evening.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{let me spell it .out for you, james. books don't mean anything. not to anybody. not anymore.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{arsonist's daughter meant something.}
<A>__{grady smiles contemptuously.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i mean it. it means something to me. it's one of the reasons i came to school here. to be in your class. to be taught by you.}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{it's one of the reasons i wanted to become a writer.}
<A>__{grady stares ahead, watching the darkness tumble away before the wide sweep of the galaxie's headlights.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{well, for that, if nothing else, james, i'm sorry.}
