The music has a sensuous, driving beat. Voices begin to chant. Steven holds his arms parallel to the floor. Slowly he begins to turn, clockwise. The beat picks up and he whirls more quickly, his mouth coming open. Now he begins to whirl about the room. The chanting grows in intensity. Although he is blindfolded, Steve deftly avoids running into furniture and other objects. Steven stops whirling at the precise moment the music stops playing.

<ACTION>__{The taxi crosses Park Avenue, speeding past the bronze statue of a man hailing a cab. It approaches First Avenue, where a road divider bisects the thoroughfare. Nicky swings into a sharp turns, barely averting contact with the divider, and stops abruptly. Three doors open. On the empty street, Nicky hands the driver a wad of bills. Then he and Laurel step over the divider. He puts his arm around her shoulders and they cross the avenue to the glass tower where they live. The sun begins to climb out of the East River.}
