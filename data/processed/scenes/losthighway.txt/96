<A>__{footsteps can be heard on the stairs. fred's head appears at the top of the stairway. he comes up into the living room carrying a manila envelope, like the ones previously received. his expression is strained. he is alone. fred pulls a videotape out of the envelope and inserts it in the vcr, turns it on. he sits on the couch and watches. we go from a wide shot to a full frame shot of the video. on the tape is the same nighttime interior of the house, accompanied by the droning sound. the camera moves eerily down the hall toward the bedroom, sliding at a high angle. the camera turns slowly into the bedroom looking down. blood is splattered over the floor, bed, walls. the camera drifts. the dead body of renee lies on the floor at the foot of the bed. she is badly mutilated. fred is hovering over her on the tape, on his knees, a horrified, unbelieving expression on his face. on the tape, fred turns away from renee his hands raised, dripping blood her blood. his movements are almost mechanical, constricted, as he strains strangely upwards seemingly against his will, as if feeling some enormous pressure. he looks directly at the camera, his face a ghastly grimace, contorted, just before the taped image goes to snow.}
