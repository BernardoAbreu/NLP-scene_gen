<L>__{interior catherine's house}
<A>__{as dorothy and her companions confront the wizard, there's a knock at the screen door and catherine sees novak waiting.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{catherine cradles her cat.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{ready.}
<A>__{he opens the door and escorts a leashed valentine into the living room. catherine's cat squirms from her arms and hides under the couch.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{that went well.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{give her a minute.}
<P>__{(smiles at the dog)}
<D>__{hello, valentine.}
<A>__{novak unleashes the albino shepherd and he runs to catherine, licking her face, wagging his tail.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{you sure about this?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<P>__{(calling for the cat)}
<D>__{abigail...}
<A>__{valentine picks up the cat's scent and sniffs around the base of the sofa.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{i heard julia and john got married.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{yep. eloped.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{good for them.}
<A>__{valentine settles on the floor. slowly, abigail's curiosity gets the best of her and she creeps out, sniffing the dog's nose. patient and sweet, valentine lies still, allowing the cat to reach an acceptable level of comfort.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{well look at that.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i told you. you have to be optimistic. believe in them...}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{so you say.}
<A>__{amazingly, abigail brushes up against the dog and purrs.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{he's mine?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{all yours. my boss says it's one of the strangest requests the bureau's ever had.}
<A>__{catherine laughs. she likes that.}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{he also says that until proven differently, julia hickson was found as a result of good old fashioned detective work.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{it doesn't matter...}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{i don't know. i think it does.}
<P>__{(genuine concern)}
<D>__{you know, catherine... if you ever want to talk about it. what happened to stargher. that last time.}
<A>__{it's painfully clear the thought of it still troubles her.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{not just yet. okay?}
<A>__{novak doesn't push it. he just takes her hand and gives it a gentle squeeze. the cat dashes into the kitchen and valentine follows.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{they're hungry.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{i got it.}
<A>__{he moves into the kitchen. in a moment of quiet introspection, catherine looks at the television screen, at dorothy accidentally hitting the wicked witch with a bucket of water, causing her to melt. and she looks away, unable to watch, disturbed by the image. she turns to the kitchen and sees novak feeding an appreciative dog and cat. he rises and returns to the living room.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{no problem.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{no. thank you.}
<A>__{he smiles and nods, gently resting his hand on her shoulder. catherine shuts her eyes and leans toward him, comforted by simple human touch...}
