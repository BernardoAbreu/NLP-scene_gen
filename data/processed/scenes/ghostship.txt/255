<A>__{epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck. she swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the murky water. several more forms appear. they are human, suspended in the water. as epps looks, the several forms have become many. they are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before. as they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges. it is katie. she reaches toward epps, as if beckoning her to take her hand from the other side. epps raises her hand, taking it. the girl leads epps down into the murky darkness where she finds a way out. she takes her back further, coming to the breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water. katie stops at the breach. epps turns to her. she only looks back at epps. epps turns away, swimming upward toward the light of the surface.}
