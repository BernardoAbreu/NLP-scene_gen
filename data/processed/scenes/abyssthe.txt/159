<L>__{interior mess hall later}
<A>__{coffey has bud, lindsey and several of the rig crew gathered for a little summit. lindsey is withdrawn, sitting far from the others, a self imposed exile. they're all wearing warm clothes and hugging themselves. their breath shows in the air.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{i want 'round the clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras. we need early warning if the soviet craft try another incursion.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<P>__{(rolling her eyes)}
<D>__{gimme a break! coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench! trust me... they're not speaking russian.}
<A>__{coffey looks at her for a moment, then goes on as if she hadn't spoke.}
<C>__{coffey}
<P>__{(to one night)}
<D>__{why haven't you finished repairs on the hydrophone transmitter yet?}
<C>__{one night}
<D>__{i was having my nails done.}
<A>__{coffey is sweating, despite the chill. keeps his hands clenched in fists so they won't see how bad the tremors have gotten.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{get something straight. you people are under my authority }
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{look, podner... we don't work for you, we don't take orders from you, and we don't much like you. in addition to which your momma dresses you funny.}
<A>__{coffey's eyes are straight razors. he slashes them from face to face. you can see him tightening up like a clockspring, losing control of the situation in front of his own men. bud defuses it.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{'fish'?}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{yuh?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{take the first watch in sonar. hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance. one night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?}
<C>__{one night}
<D>__{gimme a couple of hours.}
<A>__{hold on coffey as everyone leaves. winding tighter.}
