<D>__{is there something on fire!!}
<A>__{logan shakes his head...he doesn't know. as logan looks up at the sun.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{it seems to be moving away. come on...}
<A>__{angle logan and jessica clambering cautiously down from the barren ledge. lower an area of boulders suddenly, a fairly strong wind starts blowing.}

<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{it feels like breath. it makes everything move. your hair is moving.}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{and yours.}
<A>__{they reach the level below and pause, look around.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{jessica we must be outside!}
