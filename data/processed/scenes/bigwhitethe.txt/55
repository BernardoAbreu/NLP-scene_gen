<L>__{interior paul's kitchen day}
<A>__{jodie the dog is in a complete frenzy, jumping up and down at the feet of paul who stands over a sizzling frying pan full of bacon. he checks the bacon's consistency with a fork. still pretty raw. he takes the bacon and lays it on a plate. beside the pan on the counter sit a baseball cap and a stapler. paul carefully takes each strip of bacon and staples it to the peak of the ball cap. he holds it up. the bacon hangs down like fringe. margaret appears in the doorway.}
