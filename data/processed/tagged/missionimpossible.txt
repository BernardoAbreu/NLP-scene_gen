<C>__{kittridge }

<D>__{i always have, claire..}

<L>__{interior rear car engineer's section day}
<A>__{phelps climbs up a ladder past an inert engineer slumped over the control panel an obvious earlier victim of phelps. phelps puts on a pair of clear goggles, reaches a trap door and climbs through it }
<L>__{exterior roof of train day}
<A>__{ halfway out onto the roof of the train. he reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a suction cup with a handle on the end of it. he smacks the suction cup down on the roof and pulls himself the rest of the way out. he pulls out a second suction cup and smacks it down on the smooth surface of the train. now for the tough part. using the suction cups, phelps slowly pulls himself forward, a foot at a time, pulling and replanting the cups as he goes. he drags himself over the length of the final car, to the back of the train, where the rear engine slants off sharply, a window for the engineer. half kneeling on the roof, phelps pulls out the clip from his belt. he looks up, scanning the sky behind the train. from out of the fog, a helicopter approaches. phelps turns and looks ahead, in the direction the train is going. in the distance, he can see the chunnel approaching the tunnel under the english channel. his eyes widen.}
<L>__{interior helicopter day}
<A>__{krieger is at the controls. he sees the approaching tunnel as well.}
<L>__{exterior roof of train day}
<A>__{phelps crawls like hell to get into position. looking up, he sees krieger pointing frantically behind him. phelps turns. ethan is climbing out the trap door. a cable and hook swing down from the helicopter, almost touching the roof of the train. phelps crawls closer to it. ethan, behind him, is in a far more precarious position. without goggles or suction cups, he has to use his fingers to grab small holes on the roof. he is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other way. loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof.}
<L>__{interior helicopter day}
<A>__{krieger sees the chunnel entrance approaching. he gestures to phelps and tries to move the cable closer to him, passing over phelps and then back to him.}
<L>__{exterior roof of train day}
<A>__{phelps grabs the cable and is about to hook the cable onto his belt, ethan slides into him and they both crash onto the roof. ethan grabs the cable out of phelps hand and clips it onto the roof. phelps and ethan struggle, but they are hurtling dangerously closer to the chunnel entrance. they're now right on top of the chunnel entrance.}
<L>__{interior helicopter day}
<A>__{krieger sees the tunnel, only seconds away now. he paws at the controls, jerking back desperately on a certain lever.}
<L>__{exterior roof of train day}
<A>__{phelps kicks ethan and he falls off the far side of the train. phelps falls off the near side and holding onto the strap manages to pull himself back on. the train zooms into the tunnel and the helicopter roars right in behind it!}
<L>__{interior business car tunnel moving day}
<A>__{as the train roars into the tunnel, the business car goes nearly dark and the message on max's computer screen changes one last time. this time it says:}
<B>__{connection terminated. transfer lost.}
<A>__{max's face falls.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{damn!}
<L>__{interior rear car engineer's section day}
<A>__{another conductor races into the power car, past his inert companion, and is shocked to see the copter right behind the train. he grabs a radio and screams into it.}

<D>__{no, no, it's in the tunnel!}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{stop the train!}
<C>__{conductor}
<D>__{it'll crash into us! accelerate, accelerate.}
<L>__{exterior roof of train tunnel day}
<A>__{for a moment, we see no one. no ethan. no phelps. moving around to the other end of the car, we see where they've gone. they're dangling from either side of it. phelps paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself back onto the roof of the train. ethan reaches for the other cup. the helicopter, fortunate that this tunnel is double track and barely wide enough to accomodate it, pursues, krieger pushing it up to full speed again. but it can't lift up high enough to go completely over the train.}
<L>__{exterior roof of train tunnel day}
<A>__{phelps, nearing the back, manoeuvers himself to the windshield of the rear power car, trying to grab the skid of krieger's copter. he doesn't see what's headed toward him, coming from the other direction. another train. at the last moment, phelps notices the reflection of the oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the roof of his train, barely avoiding getting creamed by it as it blows by. the helicopter avoids the oncoming train too and phelps misses the skid. krieger tips the front of the copter, trying to decapitate ethan with the rotor. phelps jumps onto the skid, but the copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the tunnel. sparks and chunks of cement fly. krieger levels the chopper quickly. ethan uses the moment to leap from the train onto the other helicopter skid. phelps and ethan now hang on the skids, facing one another. crouching on the skid, ethan digs in his pocket and pulls out a red and green piece of bubble gum. phelps sees it and screams at krieger, who scrambles frantically for his gun.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{red light, green light. asta lasagna mother fucker.}
<A>__{ethan mashes the red into the green, slaps the gum onto the copter's underbelly and turns away from it. phelps kicks vainly at the gum, screaming but the gum explodes. the force of the blast rockets ethan forward, he lands on the train's windshield. the helicopter whirls and bashes into the tunnel, veers wildly, then pitches forward and down, smashing phelps under the skid and exploding in a giant fireball. ethan, stuck on the windshield, can only watch as the wreckage of the copter tumbles down the train towards him. it stops just short of him, with its bent and broken rotor blade barely missing his throat. ethan lays his head against the windshield glass, utterly drained.}

<D>__{i think this is what you're looking for.}
<A>__{max looks up, stunned. kittridge leans over and peers at her screen. he just smiles and sits down next to her, content to wait for her to speak. when she finally does, she's almost charming.}

<L>__{exterior london pub day}
<A>__{luther sits on a high stool, his powerbook next to him, while he sips a beer. a television screen is featuring follow up coverage of yesterday's dramatic helicopter train wreck in the chunnel. aside from emphasizing that it was the work of a lone, crazed character in a helicopter who was killed in the crash, there are comments about how miraculous it was there were no other fatalaties. there are intermittent sounds of aircraft taking off and landing, announcements of arrivals and departures. ethan into shot. he sits beside}

<D>__{well, luther if it makes you feel any better i will always think of you that way.}
