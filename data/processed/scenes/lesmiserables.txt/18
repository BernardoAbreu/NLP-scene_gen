<L>__{interior bedroom, bishop's house night}
<A>__{the bishop leads valjean to a bedroom where the walls are also painted with religious imagery. across the passage, valjean sees the open door to the bishop's own bedroom. there the housekeeper is putting the table silver away in a cupboard. he turns to see a bed made up with clean white linen waiting for him. he hasn't slept in such a bed ever in his life. but the bishop is smiling, offering it to him.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{sleep well. tomorrow morning before you leave you will have a cup of milk from our cows, nice and hot.}
<A>__{the bishop turns away to go to sleep.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{you let me sleep here next to you? how do you know i'm not a murderer?}
<A>__{valjean laughs a strange laugh.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{god will take care of that.}
<A>__{later that night valjean lies on the bed, fully dressed, deeply asleep. outside a dog barks. valjean's eyes snap open. the first thing he sees by the light of the moon is an image of god the father gazing down on him from the painted ceiling. in panic, fearing judgement, he sits bolt upright. then he looks round, and remembers. he gets out of bed, and opens the door. there, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to the bishop's bedroom. in the moonlight, he sees the bishop lying asleep. above his bed, the cupboard where the silver is kept. valjean moves silently into the bishop's room, holding a metal miner's spike which he pulls from his bag. the floor boards creak. he looks down at the old man, holding his breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep. he reaches up to the cupboard. it is unlocked. the cupboard door opens with a sharp cracking sound. the bishop, disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. at once valjean is over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike should he wake. the bishop sleeps on. the moon comes out and lights up his beautific, smiling face. valjean is thrown. he turns back and opens the cupboard door fully: there is the silver. carefully he picks it out, fearful of every clink. one last look at the sleeping old man, and he makes a run for the door.}
