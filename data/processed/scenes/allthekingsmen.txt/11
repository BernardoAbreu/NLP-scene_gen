<L>__{interior stark farmhouse, night}
<A>__{willie finishes chewing his food, pats his mouth with a napkin, and pushes his plate back.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{now we'll talk.}
<A>__{camera pulls back to include jack, lucy, and pa, all seated around the dinner table.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you've been talking for a long time, mr. stark.}
<C>__{pappy}
<D>__{willie's got a lot to say.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{you sleepy, pappy? you want to have a nap?}
<C>__{pappy}
<D>__{no, i want to hear it.}
<A>__{lucy gets up and turns on a light in the kitchen.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i'm worried about tom. it's getting dark. he should have been home.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{he's a strong boy. don't worry about him. he can take care of himself.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how old is the boy?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{fifteen.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how long have you been married?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{nine years.}
<A>__{willie grins at jack's look of surprise. lucy comes back into the room.}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{he was a neighbor's boy. they were poor folks. both died. i couldn't have any children, so... he's a good boy.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{oh, he's the best. i couldn't love him any more if he was my own flesh and blood.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to lucy)}
<D>__{and now you, mrs. stark?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{oh, there isn't very much to tell about me.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how did you meet?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i was teaching school and one day a pupil walked in. it was willie. i couldn't have a grown man in the class and willie wanted to learn so badly... so i married him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{is that the only reason?}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(pressing willie's arm)}
<D>__{except that i loved him.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{get the coffee, lucy.}
<A>__{she goes back into the kitchen.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{when did they fire you, mrs. stark?}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(as she serves the coffee)}
<D>__{a couple of weeks ago. i'd been teaching for a long time and nobody ever said i wasn't all right. but i don't care. i don't want to teach in a schoolhouse that they built just so somebody can steal some money. and willie doesn't want to be treasurer, either, if he has to associate with those dishonest people.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(glumly)}
<D>__{i'm going to run. they can't keep me from running.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{if you don't mind the truth, mr. stark, you haven't much of a chance.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i'm going to run. they're not going to kick me around like i was dirt.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i don't care if willie loses... just so he gets the truth to the people. isn't that true, willie?}
<A>__{willie is silent. jack looks at him.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{isn't it, willie?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{hmmm?... yeah, yeah, sure, that's right.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{well, if you lose you can give a little more time to studying your law books.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, you studying law too?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{by myself, at night.}
<C>__{pappy}
<D>__{willie's a smart boy.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{if i ever find the time i'm going to take a course at the university.}
<A>__{the door opens slowly and tom comes in from the porch. his clothes are torn and his face is dirty and bloody. he still carries some of the handbills. they rise to their feet and cluster around him.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{what happened, tommy boy? what's the matter?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(head down, muttering)}
<D>__{i gave out the handbills, pa.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{speak up. speak up.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{let him tell it his own way. go on, tommy.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this time they were waiting for me. they took them away from me. threw them in the dirt and beat me up. i brought some of them back.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(pats him on the back)}
<D>__{good boy. have you eaten yet, tom?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{let him wash up first.}
<A>__{as tom and pappy go into the other room, a rock comes crashing through the front window, shattering the glass. willie, his face filled with anger, throws open the door and stalks out onto the porch. jack stands at the door, watching willie shout into the darkness around him.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i'm going to run... and you're not going to stop me. i'm gonna run even if i don't get a single vote.}
