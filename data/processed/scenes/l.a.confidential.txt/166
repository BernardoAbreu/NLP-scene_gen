<A>__{bud crouches, looks between the cinder blocks supporting the room. two sets of feet shuffling along. bud fires the shotgun. shrieks as the men go down. bud extends the .38 to fire point blank headshots. then... bud flattens himself as a wicked crossfire tears up room}
<L>__{interior victory motel night}
<A>__{exley is forced down as well, lying flat as plaster rains down. the door frame splinters as more dudley men charge in. four men with rifles. one is patchett's burly bodyguard. they spot exley lying there. hushed whispers as they approach: "dead meat." "be careful." kicks in the side. the men look at each other, sneer. exley jerks a foot. the foot man stumbles as exley spins around shooting. firing the .45 and his own .38. all four men go down. exley stands, digs into his pocket to reload. bud scrambles back through the window. exley looks over and smiles as bud reloads the shotgun. it's dead quiet.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{i'm thinking we might walk away from this.}
<A>__{at that instant, dudley steps through the bathroom door. he's got exley dead to rights. as he squeezes the trigger, bud leaps forward, pushes exley hard to the ground. the shot passes through bud's back by his left shoulder blade. it spins him around. a second shot to the stomach slows him to a walk as he charges dudley. a third round shatters bud's jaw, but still he comes. driven by rage, his hands reaching for dudley's throat. he even gets hold before a fourth slug tears his chest. bud falls hard. dudley swings his aim to exley who's just managed to shake the cobwebs of being flattened by bud. a frozen moment.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{i'm loathe to kill my brother officers, edmund.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{tell that to jack vincennes. to stensland.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{jack was a shame, but dick stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin. through his whore girl friend. i sent him to make the buy. the rest is history.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{a vacuum, edmund. that's what we have in los angeles. sending mickey cohen up created it. my containment work maintained it. certain photographs guarantee it. organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{and now you'll provide them.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{absolutely. prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. the heroin we'll run down to the coloreds. anesthetize them. as long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care. it's still a crime free city... for respectable people.}
<A>__{dudley aims the .38, cocks back the hammer. we hear}
<B>__{distant police sirens.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{this isn't politics, edmund. there won't be winners and losers when it's over...}
<A>__{dudley doesn't see bud stir, reach into a pocket.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{just the living and the dead. it's always been that way in the bureau. you should've realized that before you became a detective.}
<A>__{it's over. dudley's finger tightens on the trigger. but dudley screams as bud buries a switchblade into his left calf. it took all bud had left. as he collapses... dudley wails; exley dives for bud's shotgun. dudley fires, misses. a wild shotgun blast takes out half the wall. dudley stumbles out the door. sirens blare.}
