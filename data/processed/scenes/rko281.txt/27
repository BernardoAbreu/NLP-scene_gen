<L>__{int mank's house. santa monica day}
<A>__{a turntable spins in a corner, playing a gene krupa record. ashtrays overflow with cigar butts and messy piles of pages are littered around a typewriter. mank's beach house is tiny and on the edge of squalid welles, still in his peeling old kane makeup, is standing in the middle of the living room and mank is in the small kitchenette, chipping ice for drinks. a long pause}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{and i'm looking at them and they're all looking at me and i don't know who should pour the tea. '}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i just can't . . see it anymore}
<A>__{mank returns to the living room and thrusts a drink in welles hand.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i want you back}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{fuck you. (he sits.) you wanted me out. i'm out.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<A>__{welles hands mank a folded script from his jacket. mank looks at it as:}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{this is the shooting script we've been using every day.}
<A>__{sure enough, the title page of the script reads: citizen kane by herman j. mankiewicz and orson welles.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{it's just like we always said it would be}
<A>__{mank hands it back}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{too late, kid.}
<A>__{welles sits.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{did i ever tell you about my father?}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{i don't give a shit about }
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{he was a drunk. and he was my father and i was ashamed of him.}
<A>__{a beat. welles proceeds quietly and with difficulty.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{he showed me the world, he took me with him everywhere europe, china and he was so proud of me. but he would drink and he would get ...embarrassing. and i began to resent him because i was so ... sparkling, you see.}
<A>__{so i cut him dead. i turned my back and i walked away because i didn't need him. he was getting in the way of my "genius." and he would write me letters, and i never answered them, and he would call me, and i never took his calls, and he showed up at school and i wouldn't see him. tears are beginning to inch down welles' face}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{when i finally saw him again, he was in a coffin. i was fifteen. and all of a sudden he wasn't that embarrassing drunk anymore ... he was the man who showed me the world.}
<A>__{welles looks up at mank, tears now streaming down his face.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{just like you, mank.}
<A>__{a long beat. mank, despite himself, is moved. to cover his emotion mank rises and goes into the kitchen to freshen his drink. we remain tight on welles as we hear mank's voice:}
<C>__{mank's voice}
<D>__{so you've lost it? don't know who should pour the tea.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{yeah}
<A>__{a beat}
<C>__{mank's voice}
<D>__{orson ... just cut the goddamn tea}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{okay}
<A>__{a beat. welles reaches for a cigar, tears still wet on his face.}
<C>__{mank's voice}
<D>__{i been thinking about the beach scene. you done that yet?}
<C>__{welles}
<A>__{no}
<C>__{mank's voice}
<D>__{good cause i was thinking that we're starting the scene too late...}
<A>__{welles quickly bites off the end of his cigar his expression one of "gotcha!" even as. his cheeks are still wet with tears.}
<C>__{mank's voice }
<D>__{cause if we don't show susan watching kane more then we're not building the right tension into the scene. see, she's gotta know that...}
<A>__{welles slowly smiles as the record of gene krupa's percussion segues into the unmistakable rhythms of "sing, sing, sing" and eclipses mank's voice... and we see welles everywhere, more energized than ever: perilous on a high crane; stuck in a cramped corner behind the camera; doing magic tricks for the cast; sleeping as makeup is applied to his face... mank is always at welles' side: supporting; challenging; amusing; inspiring. . . we see welles strutting, raging, boasting, dancing. and again towering. "sing, sing, sing" finally ends at.. through the black and white viewfinder we see welles, in full costume and makeup, carefully walking across the massive kane campaign headquarters set toward us. we see the low angle black and white camera's perspective.}
<C>__{toland's voice}
<D>__{closer ... closer ... closer stop. we just lost your head.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{can you see my shoes?}
<C>__{toland's voice}
<D>__{yeah, but we lose your head.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{goddamn it joe stand here}
<A>__{joseph cotton, also in full costume and makeup, steps into the shot and takes welles' position as welles scurries out of the frame. . ..}
