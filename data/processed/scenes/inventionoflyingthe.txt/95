<L>__{interior "church" day}
<A>__{"here's comes the bride" plays over an organ and jennifer walks down the aisle towards a smiling rob. mark watches her in awe, stunned by her beauty. rob notices mark staring at jennifer and mouths "loser" at him. jennifer reaches the altar and stands across from rob. the wedding overseer, an elderly man in a suit, stands between them holding a few sheets of paper in his hand.}
<C>__{wedding overseer}
<D>__{we are sitting here in this building today to share in the wedding of rob and jennifer. two young, attractive people who have agreed that this union would be mutually beneficial and that their genetic match up would most likely produce favorable offspring and a life of financial stability and physical security.}
<A>__{both rob and jennifer nod at each other.}
<C>__{wedding overseer}
<D>__{rob, do you promise to stay with jennifer for as long as you want to and to protect your offspring for as long as you can?}

<D>__{can we get on with this?}
<C>__{wedding overseer}
<D>__{jennifer, do you promise to stay with rob for as long as you want to and to protect your offspring for as long as you can?}
<A>__{jennifer is confused. her mind is fighting it, but she doesn't know what exactly she's fighting. finally...}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{there is a sigh of relief from the room. mark shakes his head in sadness.}
<C>__{wedding overseer}
<D>__{before i pronounce these two man and wife, is there anyone here who thinks they'd offer either of these people a better genetic match up?}
<A>__{mark bolts up in his chair.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{me.}
<A>__{the whole room gasps.}
<C>__{rob}

<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<P>__{(pause; unsure)}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{mark thinks this over for a beat.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{all right. i'm done. goodbye.}
<A>__{awkwardly mark makes his way to the aisle and leaves the room. the room is thick with tension.}
