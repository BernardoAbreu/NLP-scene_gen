<B>__{a red dot}
<A>__{quivers on the dirt. a single laser point of light. wall e moves to touch it... ...the dot races along the ground. wall e drops his igloo. chases after the dot.}

<A>__{the dot leads wall e deep into the polluted expanse. he is so fixated on it he doesn't notice}
<B>__{many laser points}
<A>__{coming from every direction. all racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain. triangulating towards a center. wall e's dot suddenly stops. slowly he reaches for it. can't grab it. just light. all the dots converge in front of him. the ground shakes. wall e becomes confused. doesn't see above him. the sun growing brighter behind the cloud cover. a noise. building. rocket engines. wall e senses he should look to the sky. now three suns are descending on him. wall e runs for it. an enormous column of fire blocks his path. a second column of fire. a third. trapped. wall e cubes the ground beneath him. working fast. noise deafening. heat rising. digs in just as a tide of flame carpets the ground... ...then suddenly quiet. smoke clears.}
<B>__{close on the scorched earth}
<A>__{wall e's head rises out of the dirt. glows red hot from the heat. trembles with fright. everything in shadow. something very big looms over him. wall e climbs out of his hole. bangs his head on metal. wide on a massive spaceship. rests ominously in the empty bay. a portal on its underside opens. frightened, wall e tries to hide. nowhere to go. he places a small rock on his head. boxes up. a device lowers to the ground on a long stem. scans the surface. wall e creeps closer for a better look. the device unfolds. wall e boxes up again. a capsule descends from a chute in the stem. robot arms emerge from the device. place the capsule on the ground. press buttons. the capsule falls away in sections, to reveal... ...a probe robot. it hovers gracefully above the ground. white. egg shaped. blue lit eyes. female. eve. wall e is transfixed. inches closer. watches eve from behind the device. tilts his head. time stops. she's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen. eve hovers over the ground. a blue ray emits from her front panel. fans out 180 degrees. scans random objects and areas. the device rises back into the ship. exposes wall e. he rushes for cover behind the nearest rock. never takes his eyes off eve. watches her float away from the ship. ...from the ship? the ship! engines roar back to life. wall e digging furiously. the rocket takes off. smoke clears. again, a red hot wall e peeks out from the ground. looks for eve. she is watching the ship rise into the clouds. waits until it is completely out of sight... ...then eve rises high up into the air. she flies around the bay. soars like a graceful bird. does loops in the sky. zooms right past wall e's rock. he is hypnotized. eve descends gently to the ground... wall e sneaks up closer. hides behind another boulder. slips. makes a noise. instantly, eve whips around. her arm converts into a laser cannon. blasts wall e's boulder to smithereens. ...smoke clears...all quiet. eve, now cold and dangerous. scans the area. no sign of life. all business again. hovers away to probe more of the planet.}
