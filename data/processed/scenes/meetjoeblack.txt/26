<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{as parrish and the young man enter, allison is heard in the background.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{...well, here's another possibility. it's a little last minute, but how does this strike you? kaleidoscopes. little gold kaleidoscopes. some german firm went kerplunkt, tiffany's picked these things up, they're perfect party favors, however they're not personal, they're winter scene or something, snow flakes and dachshunds...}
<A>__{parrish and the young man appear at the table, an awkward pause ensues, the unannounced guest's presence at a family dinner being noted, and the guest himself carefully survey ed. finally, allison breaks the ice:}
<C>__{allison }
<P>__{(to the young man)}
<D>__{hi there }
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{parrish is horribly uncomfortable as the young man looks at each person as if he were discovering a face of the first time.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{uh sorry to have stepped away for so long uh this is a friend of mine i asked to drop by we got to talking and stuff uh he's going to join us for dinner um }
<A>__{parrish drifts into another awkward pause.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(to the young man)}
<D>__{hello, how nice to meet you. and wouldn't it be nicer if my father would introduce you?}
<C>__{young man}
<P>__{(to allison)}
<D>__{'...how nice to meet you.'}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. this is my daughter, allison, and her husband, quince, drew, my number one, works with me...}
<A>__{parrish drifts off as the young man awkwardly shakes hands with each person.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(prompting)}
<D>__{daddy. does your friend have a name?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{a name?}

<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{oh, excuse me. this is uh this is }
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{daddy! come on, a name.}

<D>__{sorry...um you you know it's gone right out of my head }
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{i'm sorry. this is uh uh...}
<A>__{the group waits patiently.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{joe!}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{joe...}
<A>__{parrish once more drifts into silence. (the young man is now identified as "joe".)}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{just plain 'joe'?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{love that name.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{me, too. hey, buddy!}
<A>__{joe, turned on by quince's broad smile, reacts to it as drew squints observingly at joe.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{'joe...'}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{is there any more to it?}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{like 'smith' or 'jones '}
<A>__{parrish's face reveals a desperate searching for a last name, a furtive glance at joe. parrish's brow darkens and a name tumbles from his lips:}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{ black.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{whew, at last. nice to meet you, mr. black.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{'joe black'. won fifteen and lost two for the brooklyn dodgers in}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{quince}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{you bet. i'm kind of my rotisserie league.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{are you?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{he is! let's sit down }
<A>__{luisa has set a plate in front of joe, and parrish's, which was taken to the kitchen to be warmed, has been returned. joe looks over at the other guests, then picks up his uten sils gingerly, strives to copy the others, stops, staring at his foot.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{paillarde of veal.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then luisa hits it again in the kitchen.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{honey !}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{you know what i'm saying, joe?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(laughing emptily)}
<D>__{joe knows what you're saying, just being polite }
<A>__{drew is studying joe.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{have we met?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{uh he's from out of town }
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{how long you here, joe?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{as long as it takes.}
<A>__{drew is provoked by the response, but remains polite:}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you and bill old friends?}
<A>__{parrish jumps in:}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{i get the feeling you've done some business before.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{we have an arrangement now.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{what side of the industry did you say you were on?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i didn't say.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{joe sounds like a ringer, bill. i have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already. need any help with the details?}
<A>__{parrish falls silent again, looking for an answer.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{i'm sorry business at dinner...}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{forgive me for being so rude.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{the doors to the dining room open, susan appears.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{hi, everybody. sorry to be late had to have dinner with my depart ment chief }
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{you ate?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{...i'm here, aren't i? wouldn't miss a loose end meeting. what's on the table for discussion? party favors, flowers hi dad, hi drew }
<A>__{she kisses drew in some light, humorous way they have ob viously done before, their heads bobbing like plastic water toys and their lips meeting mid air. at the kiss's conclusion susan suddenly notices joe is present and has been watching. she is shocked, embarrassed, pleased, conflicted, an instant and wide spectrum of emotions.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{you know each other?}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(lightly)}
<D>__{we've met.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{ this morning. the corinth coffee shop. he was looking for a doctor.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{well, i guess he's found one.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{joe, you do get around.}
<A>__{joe is happily confounded by all the interaction.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{that's your name?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{and isn't it a lovely one? so sturdy, so straight }
<A>__{joe has heard susan's question but, as he studies her, doesn't answer.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{incidentally, joe, where're you staying?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{here...}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{'here'?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{in this house?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{great!}
<A>__{parrish pushes his plate away.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{uh will that hold you, joe?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{incidentally, 'joe' what?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{black.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{hey, this is fun.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{so, what are you doing here?}
<A>__{parrish tenses, but joe doesn't answer.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{cat got your tongue? you weren't so silent this morning.}
<A>__{drew reacts to this allusion of intimacy.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{now, i'm getting interested. i want to know more }
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{we've got some things to discuss.}
<A>__{parrish stands, motions for joe to rise.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{ did i hear 'business'?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what 'business'?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{don't bother asking, we already tried.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it's so very nice to see you again.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{funny, i don't get that feeling. maybe it's because you found out i'm bill parrish's daughter.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{cut it out, susan.}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{you and i've got to talk. big day tomorrow, everybody. joe, let's go.}
<A>__{joe rises, follows parrish to the door, stops:}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{susan.}
<P>__{(to allison)}
<D>__{allison.}
<P>__{(to quince)}
<D>__{quince.}
<P>__{(to drew)}
<D>__{drew.}
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{bill...}
<P>__{(to the group)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he makes an awkward little bow, then heads for the nearest door.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{joe, that's the kitchen.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{joe pivots, and he follows parrish out the proper door.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{that was 'joe'.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{he's cute.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{very.}
<A>__{susan's eyes are still on the door where joe exited, her face reflecting her irritation and bewilderment, as well as a tinge of excitement.}
