<L>__{interior living room minutes later}
<A>__{jimmy is seated in the devastated living room. putting on shoes. he hears a commotion outside: a woman scream ing. water splashing. he frowns, puzzled. gets up. pads out onto a redwood deck.}
<L>__{exterior redwood deck same}
<A>__{a six foot behemoth is seated in a jacuzzi at the far end of the deck. he is dunking a terrified female head under the water and laughing. jimmy clears his throat.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{ho. ray.}
<A>__{the man looks up, annoyed.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{what the fuck you want, jimmy?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{what's with the girl?}
<A>__{she surfaces, sputtering and screaming. ray thrusts her beneath the surface again.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{bitch won't blow me.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(pause, then)}
<D>__{too early in the morning, ray. let her go.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{fuck you. she's not coming up till she starts blowing.}
<A>__{jimmy swallows hard. says:}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{ray. let her go.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{fuck you, loser. what are you doing at a league party, asshole? you and ol' dex manley should get together, swap stories about gettin' booted.}
<A>__{jimmy controls himself with an effort.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{ray, she's gonna drown.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{not if she blows me.}
<A>__{jimmy's eyes are smoldering. he steps to the right. casually scoops up a football lying on the deck.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{last chance, ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{go spit.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{jimmy turns, as if to walk away. instead, he spins back and launches the football. it sings, that's how hard he throws it. and when it smacks ray in the face, something breaks. it ain't the ball. the big man howls. clutching his flattened nose. the girl comes up for air. gagging and choking. jimmy is at her side instantly. pulls her out of the water.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{get out of here. go.}
<A>__{she goes. he leans over and grabs ray by the hair. the guy is bleeding. delirious. jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{best arm in the national league, you son of a bitch. remember that.}
<A>__{he lets go. ray sags, semi conscious. the poker players come running as jimmy walks back inside.}
