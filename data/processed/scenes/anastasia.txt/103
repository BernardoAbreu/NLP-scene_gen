<L>__{exterior boat dock (la havre) day}
<A>__{as anya walks down the plank her dress gets caught on a nail. dmitri is walking toward her as she yanks her dress free and accidentally punches him in the stomach. dmitri takes it like a man.}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{oh! i'm sorry...}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{it's okay. didn't hurt..}
<A>__{vlad has been watching as he walks down the plank with meetoo they exchange an "oh boy" look, both noticing that clearly something is different between anya and dmitri. anya catches something out of the corner of eye and turns quickly. close on a sign: "paris 30 kilometers" anya walks away from dmitri and over to the sign and looks at it longingly.}
<C>__{anya}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{i'm almost there... i'm finally going to know...}
<B>__{at the other end of the dock}
<A>__{vladimir stares into his purse, depressed.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{how is our current financial status?}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{if i used the word "bleak" i would be optimistic.}
<A>__{as he says this the elderly dowager from the ship passes by with her two obnoxious pug dogs. meetoo growls as vlad and dmitri get an idea.}
<C>__{vladimir }
<D>__{the "odessa dunk"?}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{it worked in odessa...}
<A>__{vladimir picks up meetoo and whispers instructions. meetoo likes the plan.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{as meetoo races past the pugs. they ignore him, so he stops and makes a face, giving them a sloppy "razzberry", which piques them a little. meetoo then bends over and waves his furry little butt at them. now the pugs are offended and take off after him, yapping all the way. meetoo turns and scrambles with the pugs in hot pursuit. as they get closer, meetoo suddenly stops and the pugs go flying off they edge of the dock and into the water below. meetoo looks over the edge and gives them a 'boy, are you guys morons look as the elderly dowager runs up screaming.}
<C>__{elderly dowager}
<D>__{help! my little dogs! chevalier! maurice! hold on, darlings!}
<A>__{dmitri comes running up, a little too gallant.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{i will save them, madame}
<A>__{dmitri dives into the water as vlad rushes up behind the elderly dowager. anya watches from a distance as dmitri climbs out of the water carrying the soaked (and pissed) pugs.}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{such bravery! why, that man should be rewarded! amply rewarded!}
<B>__{minutes later}
<A>__{dmitri hands vlad a pile of francs as anya approaches.}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{that was really very kind of you.}
<A>__{she gives him a kiss on the cheek and walks away with meetoo, who turns back and gives dmitri a look. a little guilty, dmitri turns to vlad.}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{i won't say a word...}
