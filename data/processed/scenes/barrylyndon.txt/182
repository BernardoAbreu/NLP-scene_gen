<D>__{dr. johnson, i think you misbehave most grossly, treating my opinions with no more respect than those of a schoolboy. you fancy, sir, you know a great deal more than me, because you quote your "aristotle" and "plato," but can you tell me which horse will win at epsom downs next week? can you shoot the ace of spades ten times without missing? if so, talk about aristotle and plato with me.}
