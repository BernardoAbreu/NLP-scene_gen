<L>__{interior infirmary}
<A>__{one of them flicks on the lights as they come shuffling into the medical room, carrying broussard. revealed is a rather small cubicle whose walls are lined with machinery. the principle item of interest is a mechanized bunk bed, which rests in a cradle and slides in and out of a slot in the wall.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{help me, come on, let's get him up here.}
<A>__{they slide the man onto the bunk.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{that thing, god almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{it wouldn't come.}
<A>__{standard yanks off his gloves.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{medical gloves.}
<A>__{they pull thin elastic gloves from a dispenser in the wall, and pull them on. gingerly, they approach broussard. standard places his hands on the octopus thing that is slowly pulsing on broussard's face. he grasps the tentacles in his hands and tries to pull it free.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{it's really on there tight.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{here, let me try.}
<A>__{faust takes a pair of pliers from a rack, and carefully grasps the tip of one of the tentacles. squeezing tightly, he leans back with all his weight.}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(grabbing faust's hands)}
<D>__{stop it, you're tearing his face.}
<A>__{a trickle of blood begins to ooze down broussard's cheek.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{it's not coming off not without his whole face coming off too.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{let's let the machine work on him.}
<A>__{efficiently, they strip broussard naked, then standard presses a couple of switches on the wall. the machine lights up, and broussard is sucked into the slot in the wall. he is visible inside. the machine immediately sprays a cloud of disinfectant on him, then sterilizes him with a blinding pink light. a bank of video monitors pops on, revealing x ray images of different parts of his body. sensors begin to scan, relays chatter.}
<B>__{roby appears in the doorway.}
<A>__{standard turns and looks at him. for a long moment, the two men regard each other, then standard steps forward and slaps roby across the}
<B>__{face.}
<A>__{the others are shocked.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{hey now, what is this?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{ask him.}
<C>__{roby}
<P>__{(slowly puts his hand to his cheek)}
<D>__{i understand why you did that.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{he wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{yeah... well, maybe he should have. i mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here. maybe you}
<A>__{deserve to get}
<D>__{slapped.}
<C>__{faust}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{excuse me, i've got work to do.}
<A>__{faust exits.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{i keep my mouth pretty much shut, but i don't like hitting.}
<C>__{roby}
<P>__{(to standard)}
<D>__{i guess i had it coming. let's call it settled.}
<A>__{after a hard stare at roby, standard gives him a curt nod and turns his attention to the machinery.}
<C>__{roby }
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{would somebody fill me in?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{he went into the pyramid alone. we lost radio contact with him. when we pulled him out, it was on his face. it won't come off, not without injuring him.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{where did it come from? melkonis he's}
<A>__{the only one that knows that.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{how does he breathe?}
<A>__{they study the monitors.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{blood's thoroughly oxygenated.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{yeah, but how? his nose and mouth are blocked.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{let's look inside his head.}
<A>__{standard punches some buttons, and on the monitors, a kind of x ray image in vivid colors appears, depicting broussard's head and upper}
<B>__{torso.}
<A>__{the parasite is clearly visible on broussard's face. in x ray, the creature is a maze of complicated biology. but the shocking thing is that, in x ray, we can see that broussard's jaws are forced wide open, and the parasite has extruded some kind of long tube, which is stuffed}
