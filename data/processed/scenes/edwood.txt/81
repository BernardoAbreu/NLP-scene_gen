<D>__{bela?!}
<A>__{ed tries the door. it's unlocked.}
<L>__{interior bela's house same time}
<A>__{ed steps into the dark room, and is stunned by what he sees: bela is slumped on the floor, pasty white, eyes glazed. a rubber tube is tied on his arm, and a hypodermic needle lies next to him. the dogs crouch behind him, whimpering, despondent, bela looks up through half opened eyes.}
