<L>__{interior harrods. day.}
<A>__{bean and his car whizz through the ground floor, past perfume counters and leather glove racks.}
<T>__{cut to :}
<A>__{a security guard. as he passes one of the counters, bean's little car just shoots behind him. the guard continues through the children's section there are giant elephants and teddies, children's size cars, then two huge plastic tractors and then, stock still, strangely in harmony actually, the lime green mini with bean in it. the guard walks straight past. the moment he is gone, bean shoots off again but, damn!, spies another guard and is forced to turn and drive down some very steep stairs indeed. the theme song goes crazy as the record player jumps.}
