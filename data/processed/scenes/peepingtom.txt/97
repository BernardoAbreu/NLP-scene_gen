<L>__{interior set day}
<A>__{the set is completely deserted. it is lit by a single lamp. a solitary trunk stands on the counter, its lid closed. we see don jarvis enter, followed by the two policemen. baden and the publicity man bring up the rear. don jarvis points towards the trunks department. the chief inspector nods, then he and the sergeant approach the counter. carefully the inspector raises the lid of the trunk he looks inside. close shot of the inspector over the top of the lid. his expression is mainly one of surprise. close shot of the sergeant staring into the trunk. he is also surprised but there is nausea in his face. they look up at almost the same moment... their eyes meet.}

<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{i know...}
<P>__{(he closes the trunk quickly. quietly)}
<D>__{... don't say anything.}
<P>__{(he faces don jarvis)}
<D>__{well, sir... we shall probably have to interview everyone at the studio, so we'd better plan a campaign that won't interfere too much with your productions.}
<C>__{jarvis}
<P>__{(warming to him at once)}
<D>__{thank you, chief inspector... if you knew what even a single day's delay could cost.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{oh, we do sir.}
<P>__{(his eyes are on the trunk)}
