<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior pyramid sarcophagus chamber}
<A>__{flashlight beams cut through the darkness. lex checks her digital compass.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{we must be directly beneath the sacrificial chamber.}
<A>__{up ahead there is a small amber glow. weyland, lex, sebastian, miller, max, and connors enter in a vast chamber of some kind. they find the flares they dropped through the grate in the sacrificial chamber. they look up and quickly realize that the sacrificial chamber is directly above them, linked by a stone shaft of some kind.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{we're at the heart of the pyramid.}
<A>__{lex sees something. the rest of them train their flashlights on the object. at the center of the room is a sarcophagus. fifteen feet long, four feet wide. approximately the same dimensions as the predator "missiles." the ornate room is lit by flares in every corner. sebastian carefully examines the sarcophagus.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{some kind of sarcophagus... egyptian in design. these were built to protect the dead for their journey to the afterworld.}
<A>__{weyland runs his hand over the sarcophagus. it is encrusted with ice crystals, glittering in the half light.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{max, verheiden. open it.}
<A>__{max and verheiden move to opposite sides of the sarcophagus. they push hard but the lid doesn't move. they dig in and push with everything they have but still nothing.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{excuse me ...}
<A>__{max and verheiden take a step back as brains replace brawn. sebastian stands over the sarcophagus. his flashlight illuminates three metal dials inlaid into the stone.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<P>__{(deep in concentration)}
<D>__{some kind of combination lock.}
<A>__{sebastian kneels by a line of pictograms and hieroglyphics that run around the edge of the stone slab. he studies the designs.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{this is the long count ... the mayan calendar. days, months, years.}
<A>__{he looks between the hieroglyphics and the combination lock.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{this must be the combination.}
<A>__{sebastian illuminates the three metal dials on top of the sarcophagus.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{days ... months ... years ...}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{but what date?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{the dials are set for ...}
<A>__{sebastian hesitates for a moment. then:}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{... 1904.}
<A>__{he rechecks the hieroglyphics, not quite believing what he is seeing }
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{exactly one hundred years ago.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{someone opened this a hundred years ago?}
<A>__{sebastian gives her that knowing smile of his.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{only one way to find out.}
<A>__{sebastian turns the first of the metal dials on the top of the sarcophagus. it moves easily. sebastian glances over at lex.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{what's today's date?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{october 10th.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{10 ... 10 ... 2004.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{you sure this is going to work?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{as the tension mounts, sebastian turns the remaining two discs. the entire team is stunned as the lid to the sarcophagus begins to open}
<B>__{under its own power.}
<A>__{everyone reacts as the lid finishes opening and slides to a smooth halt. the interior of the sarcophagus is dark. there's no way you can see in without peering dangerously over the edge. sebastian cautiously approaches the edge, and slowly peers inside.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{take a look at this.}
<A>__{the others crowd around the sarcophagus. the interior of the sarcophagus contains guns. three futuristic weapons of an alien design. predator design.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<P>__{(quietly ominous)}
<D>__{the master culture.}
