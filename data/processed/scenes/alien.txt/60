<A>__{the peak of the pyramid is in extreme disrepair. broussard arrives at the top and clings to the jagged, crumbling stones.}

<P>__{(over, filtered)}
<D>__{no, it's too small, only room enough for one person.}

<A>__{broussard leans over and looks into the hole. he sees only blackness. freeing one arm, he unclips his datastick from his belt, switches on the "flashlight" function, and shines it down into the hole.}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{i can see... partway down. it just goes down like a stovepipe. smooth walls. i can't see the bottom light won't reach.}

<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{it couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases. i will just read it to you the way i got it:}

<D>__{"... hostile... survival ... advise do not land... "}
<P>__{(looks up at the others)}
<D>__{and that's all it could translate.}
