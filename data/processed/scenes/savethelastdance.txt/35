<L>__{50 white table}
<A>__{notable for its glaring absence of color. a girl we will come to know as toni sits there. and then pushing in on chenille's table she's there with a group of girls who eschew pretense. they, like chenille, are rugged and regular. they know who they are.}
<B>__{end of series of sweeping shots. angle on sara}
<A>__{eyeing chenille's table. screwing up courage as she approaches it. she gets there but two black girls are faster. they sit down in the only empty seats. sara backs off, invisible again.}
<B>__{on chenille}
<A>__{glimpsing sara from the corner of her eye as sara walks away. at nerds' table later time has passed. the cafeteria is half as full, half as noisy. sara sits among the nerds, a friendly if verbose group. she's trying to eat but a snooze button is talking her to death...}
<C>__{wonk}
<D>__{... i know you're new to the table, but think about it. we're the y2k generation and nobody takes us seriously. we don't take ourselves seriously. just look around. half the student body is d.o.a. and that's from the neck up, clara.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{sara. it's sara.}
<C>__{chenille }
<D>__{yeah. it's sara. and you're boring her from the ears down.}
<A>__{sara looks up, surprised to see chenille standing there. she flashes a knowing smile at her, indicates sara's tray.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{you finished?}
<A>__{sara leaps up with a quick, grateful nod. beats a hasty retreat from the table. as she and chenille walk through the cafeteria, sara shudders with relief. she feels rescued.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{god! thank you!}
<C>__{chenille}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{gotta watch where you sit, girl. and it's chenille. but you're still welcome. let's catch some air before the bell rings.}
