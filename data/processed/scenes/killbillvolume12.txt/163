<L>__{exterior porch dawn}
<A>__{bill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house drinking a glass of red wine. the steps lead to the beach and the sea. beatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps across from him. between them the dawn sky breaks.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{did she go to sleep easy?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{it took her a little bit. she was excited. she's quite the little chatterbox.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, if she doesn't like you, you got to kill her to say hello. but if she likes you, you can't shut her up. she's a chip off the ole blonde in that regards.}
<A>__{he holds up the bottle of vino.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{red wine?}
<A>__{she shakes her blonde head, no.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{c'mon, bea, you're a whole lot more fun with a couple glasses of wine in ya.}
<A>__{she gives him a look.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(pointing towards the beach)}
<D>__{we're going to go out there and have at it, aren't we?}
<A>__{she shakes her blonde head, yes.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, i've already had a glass. so unless you want to win by an unfair advantage, you should have a glass of wine. so we're both on the same footing wine wise.}
<A>__{she holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you know, there's an old man down here, his name is esteban viharo. he was a pimp. i knew him when i was a child. he was a friend of my mother's. i told him about you. when i showed him your picture he smiles and said;}
<P>__{(imitating his accent)}
<D>__{"yesss, i see the attraction." he told me a story about taking me to the movies when i was five. it was a movie which had lana turner in it. and whenever she would appear on screen, he said i would stick my thumb in my mouth and suck it, to an obscure amount. and he knew right then, this boy will be a fool for blondes.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{who would of ever thought you'd be such a good father?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well not you, that's for damn sure.}
<A>__{she gives him another look.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{must we have to endure your little zingers?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no we mustn't. but if you're going to say sentences like that, in the future, i will resist the temptation.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{baby, you don't have a future.}
<A>__{bill drinks some wine.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i sent you to l.a. and you never came back. i thought you'd been killed. do you know how cruel it is to make someone think someone they love is dead? i mourned you. then in the third month of my mourning, i track you down. i wasn't trying to track you down, i was trying to track down the fucking assholes who i thought killed you. and when i find you, what to i find? not only are you not dead, you're getting married to some fuckin jerk and you're pregnant? how do you expect me to react?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{why do you think i hid?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{why did you leave in the first place? you have cold eyes towards me now. i understand their temperature, but they were warm the second to the last time i saw them, or was that just my imagination?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{the bride decides to tell all. as she tells this story, parts will be shown on the screen. to give herself a running start with the story she starts it off in japanese;}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{you sent me to l.a. to kill that lady scoundrel, lisa wong.}
<A>__{bill interrupts her.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{you are you talking in japanese?}
<A>__{the bride explodes;}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{what the hell do you care what i talk in? don't you know when to keep your mouth shut? i'm trying to tell you what you want to know, if you'll just shut up and listen and stop talking! now may i continue?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you're right, i'm wrong, continue.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{the morning i left, i threw up. i don't feel like speaking in japanese anymore on the plane, i threw up. when i got to my hotel, i threw up. so naturally i started thinking, maybe i might be pregnant. so i bought one of those home pregnancy kits. went back to my room and took the test. the little strip said blue. i was going to have a baby. i tried to call you, but you weren't there, so i just thought i'd call back later.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{but you never did.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{ would you shut up, i'm trying to tell you how i feel.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{my apologies, please continue.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{so i just figured i'd call you back later. i was just so happy, i put on music and danced by myself in the hotel suite, holding my little blue strip. what i didn't know, was at some leg of my journey, i was spotted. with me in los angeles it didn't take lisa wong long to figure out someone put a hit out on her. so she sent an assassin of her own to kill me in my hotel room. as i was dancing in euphoria, the killer came down the hall.}
<A>__{there's a knock on the hotel room door. the bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole. peephole pov: a pretty korean woman in the blazer and skirt outfit of a hotel manager. she's holding a basket of flowers. the bride says through the door;}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{hello, can i help you?}
<C>__{hotel woman}
<D>__{hello, i'm karen kim, i'm the hospitality manager of the hotel. i have a welcome gift from the management.}
<A>__{seeing it through the peephole.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{oh, it's beautiful. but i'm kinda busy at this second, could you possibly come back later?}
<A>__{as she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she bends down to pick it up...}
<B>__{when...}
<A>__{a shotgun blast blows a hole in the door, right where the bent over woman was previously standing. karen kicks open the door, pump action shotgun in hand. the bride's on her back, on the floor below her. karen aims the shotgun down at her. with her foot, the bride kicks the front door. it slams back hitting karen in the face. the bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover. karen pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and fires the shotgun the bride's way. the bride dives out of the way. the blast destroys the side of the room it hits. the bride comes up from the floor with her sog in her hand, and throws it across the room at karen... karen blocks the thrown knife with her shotgun. the blade sticking in the weapon's wooden stock. she removes the knife, and drops it to the floor. the bride is a sitting duck. there's nothing she can do except wait to get shot.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{so you came here to kill lisa wong, huh? well that's my sister, bitch. i'm karen wong, and i've come here to kill you.}
<A>__{she raises the shotgun, and takes aim at the bride...}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{wait a second!}
<A>__{karen stops.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yes, i'm an assassin. yes i did come here to kill your sister. but i'm not gonna do that now.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{oh, i know you're not }
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{ listen to me! i just found out, right now not two minutes before you blew a hole in the door, i'm pregnant.}
<A>__{karen looks at her, "what?".}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{on that table is the home pregnancy kit. on the floor by the door is the strip that says i'm pregnant. i'm telling you the truth, i don't want to and i won't kill your sister. i just want to go home.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what is this, bullshit story number twelve in the female assassin's handbook?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{any other time you'd be a hundred percent right. but this time you're a hundred percent wrong. i'm the deadliest woman in the world, but right now i'm scared shitless for my baby. please, you hafta believe me. look at the strip, it's on the floor.}
<A>__{karen looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the floor.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{sit down on that bed and put your hands behind your head.}
<A>__{the bride complies. karen bends down and picks the strip off the floor. then takes the package it came in and reads the directions on the box.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{blue means pregnant.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i will read it myself, thank you.}
<A>__{it is blue, karen's starting to believe her.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{okay, say i were to believe you, what then?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{just go home. i will do the same.}
<A>__{karen does...she starts backing out of the room...before she leaves, she says;}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you fucked with the wong sisters.}
<B>__{back on the porch}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{facing karen wong, was the most frightening moment i have ever experienced. and that includes three years with that evil bastard pai mei. before that strip turned blue, i was a woman, i was your woman. i was a killer, who killed for you. before that strip turned blue, i would have jumped a motorcycle on to a speeding train ...for you. but once that strip turned blue, i could no longer do any of those things. not anymore. because now i was a mother. a mother who only had one thought on her mind. please don't harm my baby. can you understand that?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{yes. but why tell me now, and not then?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{you wouldn't have let me go. specially once you found out i was pregnant. you would've tried to talk me out of it. it would have been a big scene. i just said fuck it.}
<A>__{starting to get mad.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{fuck who?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{bill, you couldn't know i was pregnant, once you knew, you'd claim it, and i didn't want that.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that's not your decision to make.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yes, but it's the right decision. and i made it for my daughter. everybody on this earth deserves to start with a clean slate. but with us my daughter would be born into a world she shouldn't be. robbing her of the one thing everybody deserves. she would be born with blood stains. i had to choose. i chose her.}
<A>__{she takes a sip of wine. it's morning now. and now it's her turn.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{you know five years ago, if i had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen. you performing a coup de grace on me by bustin a cap in my crown, would be right at the top of the list.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'd've been wrong, wouldn't i?}
<A>__{bill listens stoney, then;}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'm sorry was that a question? of impossible things that could never happen yes in this instance you would have been wrong.}
<A>__{the bride listens stoney, then;}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well what?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{explain yourself.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i already have. when i told you the story of when i thought you were dead. didn't you get how badly i felt?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{you call that an explanation?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well if that's too cryptic let's get literal.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there are consequences to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard. you experienced some of them.}
<A>__{that's his explanation. she hears it. they both understand one another.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{you and i have unfinished business.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{baby, you ain't kidding.}
<A>__{they both laugh.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you know how proud i am of you, don't you?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you know i was rooting for you, don't you?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{i figured.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you know on that beach out there i want you to be the victor?}
<A>__{she nods her head, yes.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you also know you're going to have to defeat me. i can't just give it to you, even though i want to.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{it won't be necessary for you to give me anything. i've surpassed you. i will take it.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, as they say in missouri, show me.}
