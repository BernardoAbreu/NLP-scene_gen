<P>__{(in the car.)}
<D>__{christ! she dove off!}
<A>__{in a panic, the cop makes a wrong turn. the girl falls for several seconds. she lands on the roof of a flying cab.}
<L>__{interior cab night}
<A>__{korben tries to control his car, reeling from the impact.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{you have just had an accident. seven points have been temporarily removed...}
<A>__{korben manages to stop his cab, pulls over to the side.}
<D>__{voice korben you have one point left on your license. have a good day.}
<A>__{korben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are. the girl, a bit dazed (who wouldn't be), emerges from the debris and sits up. there's some blood on her face. korben is stunned. the girl's still alive and... so beautiful. his heart heads for a meltdown.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{akina delutan, nou shan.}
<C>__{korben}
<P>__{(lost)}
<D>__{...'scuse me?}
<A>__{a police car with wailing sirens halts in front of korben.}
<C>__{cop}
<P>__{(over a loudspeaker)}
<D>__{you have an unauthorized passenger in your vehicle. we are going to arrest her. please leave your hands on the wheel. thank you for your cooperation.}
<C>__{korben}
<P>__{(obeying)}
<D>__{sorry, hon, but i only got one point left on my license and i gotta get to the garage!}
<A>__{the police car presses up against the cab. doors slide open. huge guns point at her. korben feels lousy. the girl's helpless, there are tears in her eyes, she looks exhausted. korben glances at her in the rear view mirror. she's looking all around to find something to help her communicate with him. her pov: an ad on the back of the seat. an 800 number to help an orphanage. a teary photo of a kid over the words please help. she shoots to korben a look of pure distress.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(irresistible)}
<D>__{please... help...}
<A>__{korben can't resist her plea.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{don't put me in this position... i can't... i'm late as it is...}
<A>__{but he cannot say no to her eyes.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{finger's gonna kill me.}
<A>__{korben shuts oft the meter and floors it, sideswiping the police car as he roars away.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{your license has been revoked. would you please....}
<A>__{korben whips out a gun and shatters the loudspeaker.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{i hate when people cry... i got no defense...}
<A>__{the police car takes out after him, sirens screeching. an insane chase ensues.}
