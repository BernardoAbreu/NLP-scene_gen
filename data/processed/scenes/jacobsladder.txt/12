<L>__{interior jacob's apt. day}
<A>__{sunlight pours through the bedroom window. jacob is sleeping fitfully as a bar of light saturates his face. his hand rushes up to cover and protect his eyes but the damage is done. he is awake. jacob lies in bed for a few moments, dazed. slowly his hand gropes along the shelf at the head of the bed, searching for his glasses. he has trouble finding them. as his hand sweeps blindly across the headboard it hits the telephone and sends it crashing to the floor. he sits up with a disgusted look on his face and searches the out of focus shelf behind him. suddenly jezzie enters.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{you up?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no. have you seen my glasses?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{where'd you leave 'em?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{did you look around the headboard?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{jezzie, i can't see.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(she scans the shelf)}
<D>__{maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.}
<A>__{she leaves and returns moments later with his glasses and a large paper bag. she tosses them both onto the bed.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(he puts on his glasses and notices the bag)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{your kid dropped it off.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{who? jed?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(stooping to pick up the phone)}
<D>__{no. the little one.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{eli. why can't you remember their names?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{they're weird names.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{they're biblical. they were prophets.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{well, personally, i never went for church names.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{and where do you think jezebel comes from?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{i don't let anybody call me that.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{you're a real heathen, you know that, jezzie? jesus, how did i ever get involved with such a ninny?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{you sold your soul, remember? that's what you told me.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yeah, but for what?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{a good lay.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{and look what i got.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{the best.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i must have been out of my head.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{jake, you are never out of your head!}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(ignoring the criticism}
<D>__{and reaching for the}
<P>__{paper bag)}
<D>__{what's in here?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{pictures. your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.}
<A>__{jacob lifts the bag and pours the photographs onto the bed. there are hundreds of them. he examines them with growing delight.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{look at these, will ya? i don't believe it. jesus, these are fantastic. look, here's my dad ... and here's my brother, when we were down in florida.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{lemme see.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(rummaging excitedly through the pile)}
<D>__{here. look. this is me and sarah when i was still at city college.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(looking closely)}
<D>__{that's sarah?}
<P>__{(she studies the photo)}
<D>__{i can see what you mean.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{why you left.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what do you mean you can see?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{look at her face. a real bitch.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{she looked good then.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{not to me.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{well, you didn't marry her.}
<A>__{he digs through more photos. suddenly he stops.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{to jezzie's surprise and his own, tears well up in his eyes. for a moment jacob is unable to speak. he just stares at one of the photos. jezzie looks at the picture. it is an image of jacob carrying a small child on his shoulders.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{is that the one who died?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{gabe.}
<A>__{jezzie is silent. jacob grabs a kleenex and blows his nose.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sorry. it just took me by surprise. i didn't expect to see him this morning ... god, what i wouldn't ... he was the cutest little guy. like an angel, you know. he had this smile ...}
<P>__{(choking up again)}
<D>__{fuck, i don't even remember this picture.}
<A>__{hiding his emotions, jacob scrambles over the bed and reaches for a pair of pants. he pulls out his wallet and then carefully puts the photo of gabe inside. it joins photos of his two other boys. jezzie begins shoving the remaining pictures back into the paper bag.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{wait. don't.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{i don't like things that make you cry.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i just want to look ...}
<A>__{he reaches into the pile for other snapshots. we see an array of frozen moments, happy, unfocused, obscure. suddenly he stops and stares at a yellowing snapshot.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{god, this is me!}
<P>__{(he holds up a baby photo)}
<D>__{look. it's dated right after i was born.}
<P>__{(he stares at it intently)}
<D>__{what a kid. cute, huh? so much promise.}
<A>__{jezzie surveys the scene.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{it's amazing, huh jake? your whole life ... right in front of you.}
<P>__{(she pauses before}
<D>__{making her final}
<P>__{pronouncement)}
<D>__{what a mess!}
