<A>__{chris looks up. sees jill holding the rocket launcher. he runs past the tyrant, okey doking, left, right, then dodging left again. the monster swipes at him with its elongated claw. chris' flack jacket is caught. protective fibers fly. but chris escapes without injury. jill pitches the weapon. chris catches it. the tyrant is on him, about to stomp him with a bionic foot when... ...chris aims at the monster's rhinoceros heart and fires! the rocket connects, on target. the casing around the animal heart explodes... and the tyrant drops like a giant redwood... ...on top of chris's legs. as chris tries to free himself, he checks the detonator. three minutes. two fifty nine. eight. seven. six. laguardia drops his chopper a bit lower. the bottom of the ladder hits the ground, coming within chris' reach. he grabs on. the helicopter rises again. chris is pulled out from under the tyrant's steel body and is lifted into the air. he climbs frantically. above him, jill is still on the ladder as well. ada and rebecca pull her up. chris dangles as the huey banks away over the forest. the tops of trees whip his legs, but he hangs on, climbing up... up... until the others catch his hands and hoist him into the chopper. chris checks the led. one minute, forty five seconds.}
