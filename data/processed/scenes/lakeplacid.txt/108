<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior campsite day}
<A>__{jack and keough are there to meet kelly.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{just heard from wildlife and florida fish and game. they should be here by four.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we might as well pack.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{good idea.}
<C>__{hector }
<D>__{they'll kill him.}
<A>__{they turn to see, hector is standing there.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{they're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans. tranq him in water, he drowns.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{they could try to tranq him on land.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(knowing)}
<D>__{they won't. he's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{gee, that would really disappoint me.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{forget about him being god, he's thirty feet long, he is a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to maine. this is a grand beast. a grand dragon. an attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, you can try talking them into that, if }
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i have enough flaxedil with me to put him out. and i think i know a way to }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{forget it.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{look. i know i'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it. they have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed, }
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{which is exactly what...}
<C>__{hector }
<D>__{please, hank, let me finish i'm having a sane moment, this is a window.}
<C>__{hector }
<D>__{if he were neutralized when they got here... they might consider saving him.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{and how would we neutralize him?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{we lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{jack. we've all seen it. he's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.}
<A>__{hector's impassioned here, he's not fooling around.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so maybe wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to }
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{we both know what they'll do.}
<A>__{silence. admission by silence. then }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{even if we could tranq him how would we get him on land.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{other than to eat us?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{he follows anything that moves. you guys can be in the trucks with tranq guns. if he charges, drive off, plus hank you've got your hand held cannon. we could do this with no safety risk. if it works, we save a beast that should be saved.}
<A>__{a beat. they are sympathetic to the idea.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and again. how would you get him on land?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{that's actually the easy part.}
