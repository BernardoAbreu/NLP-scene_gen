<P>__{(trying to be cheery)}
<D>__{you just shook your head that doesn't make you happy?}
<C>__{westley}
<D>__{my brains, his steel, and your strength against sixty men, and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy? i mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be something.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{where did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had?}
<C>__{fezzik}
<D>__{over the albino, i think.}
