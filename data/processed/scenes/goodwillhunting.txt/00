<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior l street bar & grille, south boston evening}
<A>__{the bar is dirty, more than a little run down. if there is ever a cook on duty, he's not here now. as we pan across several empty tables, we can almost smell the odor of last nights beer and crushed pretzels on the floor.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{oh my god, i got the most fucked up thing i been meanin' to tell you.}
<A>__{as the camera rises, we find four young men seated around a table near the back of the bar.}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{oh jesus. here we go.}
<A>__{the guy holding court is chuckie sullivan, 20, and the largest of the bunch. he is loud, boisterous, a born entertainer. next to him is will hunting, 20, handsome and confident, a softspoken leader. on will's right sits billy mcbride, 22, heavy, quiet, someone you definitely wouldn't want to tangle with. finally there is morgan o'mally, 19, smaller than the other guys. wiry and anxious, morgan listens to chuckie's horror stories with eager disgust. all four boys speak with thick boston accents. this is a rough, working class irish neighborhood and these boys are its product.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{you guys know my cousin mikey sullivan?}
