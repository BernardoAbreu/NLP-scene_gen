<P>__{(she wails)}
<D>__{barnett!}
<A>__{she sits down on the floor at the foot of the bed and begins to cry. barnett backs off. if she was hoping for understanding, she is not about to receive it.}
<C>__{barnett}
<D>__{what the hell is wrong with you? huh?}
<A>__{he bends down and looks at her with the eyes of a race horse owner whose investment just collapsed in the stretch.}
<C>__{barnett}
<D>__{wait a minute. you're not going nutsey on me, are you? huh...? you're not going to have one of those nervous breakdowns or anything, are you?}
<A>__{afraid she has gone too far, barbara jean stops crying and tries to make everything all right. but she is still choking in her own panic of being left.}
<C>__{barbara jean}
<D>__{a... no... no, i'm just... i'm really fine... i just.}
<P>__{(she gets up)}
<D>__{don't want you to think i'm giving up or anything like that...}
<A>__{barnett looks at her as if from now on he will suspect her of secretly being crazy. he begins to pick up the flowers from the floor.}
<C>__{barnett}
<D>__{i will just take these on over to her. show her your appreciation.}
<A>__{barbara jean crawls numbly back into her bed, nodding affirmatively.}
<C>__{barbara jean}
<D>__{sure... you go on and do that.}
<A>__{she begins to shiver. barnett looks at her, but he makes no attempt to come any closer.}
<C>__{barbara jean}
<P>__{(very small)}
<D>__{barnett?}
<A>__{he leans in and pats her arm gingerly.}
