<L>__{interior office, warehouse moments later}
<A>__{saito is laid out on an old desk. arthur examines him. he motions to ariadne. eames watches cobb.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{hold this. firm pressure.}
<A>__{arthur turns to cobb.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you knew the risks and you didn't tell us.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{there wasn't meant to be any risk. we weren't supposed to be dealing with a load of gunnre.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you had no right.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{it's the only way you can go three layers deep, arthur.}
<A>__{arthur turns to yusuf, hostile.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{and you. you went along with this?}
<C>__{yusuf}
<D>__{i trusted him.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you trusted him? when? when he promised you half his share?}
<C>__{yusuf}
<P>__{(offended)}
<D>__{no! his whole share. plus, he told me he'd done it before.}
<A>__{arthur turns to cobb.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{oh, yeah? with mal? that worked out great, didn't it, cobb?}
<A>__{cobb grabs arthur.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you don't know anything about that. this was the only way to do this job, arthur. i did what i had to do to get back to my children.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{so you led us into a war zone with no way out.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{we have a way out. the kick. we just have to push on, do the job as fast as possible and get out using the kick.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{forget it. we go any deeper, we just raise the stakes. i'm sitting it out on this level.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you'll never make it, eames. fischer's security is surrounding this place as we speak. the ten hours of the flight is a week at this level you'll never make it without getting killed. downwards is the only way forwards. we have to carry on.}
<A>__{saito groans. cobb looks at him }
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{and we have to do it fast.}
<A>__{eames and arthur weigh this.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{eames, go get ready. arthur, let's get in there and soften him up.}
