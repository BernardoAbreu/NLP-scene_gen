<A>__{a worried clerk speaks in to the phone.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{mr. duke? hello, mr. duke, i'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... i thought i should call again, because i was wondering...}
<L>__{interior flamingo hotel suite day}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(hand over the phone)}
<D>__{what was that crazy bitch said to him?}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{there's a war on, man! people are being killed!}
<P>__{clerk (v o)}
<D>__{killed?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{in vietnam! on the goddamn television!}
<P>__{clerk (v o)}
<D>__{oh... yes... yes... this terrible war. when will it end?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{tell me. what do you want?}
<A>__{in the background gonzo is upturning a sofa to retrieve his stash from the lining.}
<P>__{clerk (v o)}
<D>__{the woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. i think she was crying...}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{crying? why was she crying?}
<P>__{clerk (v o)}
<D>__{well, uh. she didn't say mr. duke. but since i know you're here with the police convention...}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. we're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. it's a controlled experiment, but i suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.}
<P>__{clerk (v o) (hesitantly)}
<D>__{well, certainly... we're always happy to cooperate with the police...}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{don't worry. you're protected. just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.}
<P>__{clerk (v o)}
<D>__{what? ah... yes, yes, i see what you mean... yes... so, you'll be responsible then?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{of course. and now i have to get back to the news. send up some ice.}
<A>__{he hangs up. gonzo zaps tv channels commercials.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{good work. they'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.}
<C>__{duke}
<P>__{(slowly, carefully)}
<D>__{lucy is looking for you.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{no, she's looking for you.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{me?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{she really flipped over you. the only way i could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself.}
<P>__{(laughing again)}
<D>__{i guess she figures you won. that phone message wasn't for me, was it?}
<A>__{a look of stunned realization from duke...}
