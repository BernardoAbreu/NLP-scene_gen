<A>__{three cuts. the jingle as nick removes his dad's keys from the bureau. the trunk slamming closed with the sleeping bags inside. the roar of the engine as vijay's hand turns the key in the ignition. i e. bmw 325i (moving) day as vijay drives, lefty holds up a road map in the back seat. nick places a cd in the stereo and take five fills the car.}
<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{what is this music, nick?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's dave brubeck.}
