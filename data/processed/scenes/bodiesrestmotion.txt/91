<A>__{sid pulls up the blanket and fluffs the pillows.}

<L>__{interior beth's kitchen continuous}
<A>__{the cupboards are all open and bare. a half dozen boxes are neatly stacked. beth is sitting on the floor packing the final dishes. carol holds out a mug of coffee.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{did you need talk?}
<A>__{beth stands and takes the coffee.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{yeah. i guess i did.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{beth sips her coffee, gazing out the kitchen window. beth's pov the backyard. in the light of day it's lost its magical quality. the grass needs cutting and is marred by brown patches. the swingset looks pathetically rusted and dilapidated. close up: beth her face clouds over.}
<C>__{carol }
<P>__{(cheerfully)}
<D>__{so what are we doing?}
<B>__{beth and carol}
<A>__{carol is staring at beth staring out at the backyard.}
<C>__{beth}

<D>__{i've been here five years...}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{this state's driving me crazy.}

<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i've got no money.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i've got some.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(chagrined by self awareness)}
<D>__{i can't take it. i mean you're being great, but i can't take it. i'm gonna be gone, we won't see each other, and i won't send the money. i won't. i know... i won't get around, i will forget, i won't do it.}
<A>__{she looks around the room in disgust.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(agitated)}
<D>__{shit. i will sell all this shit. i don't want any of it, just my car and my clothes...}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{okay...}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{i'm sorry... i shouldn't have fucked this kid last night. i should have slept. now i've got all this stuff to do, and i'm tired, i'm churned up, i'm in a fuckin' mood.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{let's do things, get you busy.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{you get all the stuff you wanna sell, and i will make some tag sale signs.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no one'll buy my stuff. it's all junk.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{that's what people buy at tag sales. broken appliances, ugly knicknacks.}
<A>__{beth looks at the semi packed boxes.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i guess i do have stuff to sell.}
