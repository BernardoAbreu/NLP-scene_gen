<A>__{no lights are to be seen. smoke is coming from a chimney. camera reverses the path it took at the beginning of the picture, perhaps omitting some of the stages. it moves finally through the gates, which close behind it. as camera pauses for a moment, the letter "k" is prominent in the moonlight. just before we fade out, there comes again into the picture the pattern of barbed wire and cyclone fencing. on the fence is a sign which reads: "private no trespassing"}
