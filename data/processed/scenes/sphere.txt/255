<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior decompression room}
<A>__{a pale, white room. on norman sleeping. his eyes begin to open. he awakes. beth is next to him, looking at him. there is a long beat.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{norman looks up at her...}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you know, i think you really need to see a psychologist.}
<A>__{she stares back at him, and smiles. begins laughing with him.}
<L>__{exterior decompression chamber}
<A>__{two navy crewmen stand outside the door, looking in.}
<D>__{crewman #1 has anyone spoken to them yet? crewman #2}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{the admiral's going over the tapes they brought up now. crewman #1 does he know yet what really happened down there?}
<A>__{looking inside norman, harry, and beth sit at a table.}
<L>__{interior decompression chamber}
<A>__{at the table...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{they're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{we can refuse to talk.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{won't make any difference. the tapes document everything.}
<A>__{a long beat.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{there is one possibility.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{we all kill ourselves?}
<P>__{(laughing, then)}
<D>__{bad joke. sorry, beth.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{the power allows us to manifest our fears, right? what if we feared the power to go away?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you mean forget?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it would erase all our knowledge of it. all of our power.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{would it work?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{yes. and i think we already know it will.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{how's that?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{down below, harry said we would all have to die. since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible and we all knew then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. death was the only logical explanation. but sitting here, we still know. so how is that possible?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{unless we make ourselves forget.}
