<L>__{ext pantheon side street day}
<A>__{the police car pulls to a stop, as quietly as possible, across an open plaza from the pantheon. two black alfa romeos with tinted windows glide to a stop on either side of them. as langdon and the others get out, commander rocher and three more swiss guard, all in black suits, surround them. rocher goes straight to langdon, highly skeptical.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{i've just pulled a dozen of my best men from vatican city during conclave and left the search for the antimatter device in the hands of secondary officers. you'd better be right.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{i believe i am.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{the pantheon is one of the busiest tourist spots in rome, how could he hope to get away with it? it's impossible.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{as impossible as kidnapping four cardinals from vatican city? the poem is precise.}
<A>__{olivetti catches eyes with langdon, who's still clutching the page pulled from the diagramma. he slips it quietly into his jacket pocket.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{the poem. unbelievable. i'm basing this operation on an american's interpretation of a four hundred year old poem.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{the information we have clearly refers to raphael's tomb, and raphael's tomb is inside that building.}
<A>__{she points to the pantheon, its edifice shimmering in the early evening light.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{the pantheon is your one chance to catch this guy.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{one? i thought you said four. a pathway, four markers. we'll have four chances to catch him.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{you would have, a hundred years ago. the vatican had all the pagan statues in the pantheon removed and destroyed in the late 1800s. whatever marker was there to lead us to the next church is gone now. the path is dead. this is your chance.}
<A>__{rocher looks at him for a long moment, then turns abruptly to a}
<B>__{uniformed officer.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{separate approaches. cars to piazza della rotunda, via degli orfani, piazza sant'ignazio, and sant1eustachio. no closer than two blocks, no uniforms, three minutes. understood?}
<A>__{the officer salutes and they snap into action.}
<C>__{rocher }
<D>__{and i need a set of eyes inside.}
<A>__{two beefy guardsmen in black suits step forward.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{wait a minute, you'll scare him off.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{they're not in uniform.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{i'm sorry, two weightlifters in matching black suits and earpieces, they're hardly disguised.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{there's no time to get undercover men here.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{fine. i will go.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{i'm not sending a wom }
<A>__{her arched eyebrow stops his sentence in its tracks.}
<C>__{rocher }
<D>__{ a civilian into this situation. you have no communications and you can't carry a walkie talkie, it's too conspicuous.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{tourists have cell phones, don't they?}
<P>__{(pulls out her own and holds it to her ear)}
<D>__{hi honey, i'm at the pantheon, you should see this place!}
<A>__{rocher seems to be thinking about it. langdon looks at her, his protective instincts aroused.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{you can't send her in there alone.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{i don't intend to.}
