<L>__{exterior jade palace night}
<A>__{a dejected po stands under a peach tree in the moonlight. oogway approaches.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{i see you have found the sacred peach tree of heavenly wisdom.}
<A>__{po spins around, his face dripping with peach juice.}
<C>__{po}
<P>__{(mouth full)}
<D>__{is that what this is? i am so sorry. i thought it was just a regular peach tree.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{i understand. you eat when you are upset.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{upset? i'm not upset. what makes you think i'm upset?}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{so why are you upset?}
<A>__{po sighs, there's no use trying to lie to oogway.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{i probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu, in the history of china, in the history of sucking.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{probably.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{and the five... man, you should have seen them, they totally hate me.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{totally.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{how's shifu ever going to turn me into the dragon warrior? i mean, i'm not like the five. i've got no claws, no wings, no venom. even mantis has those...}
<P>__{(he imitates a mantis' front legs)}
<D>__{...thingies. maybe i should just quit and go back to making noodles.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{quit, don't quit. noodles, don't noodles.}
<A>__{po looks confused.}
<C>__{oogway }
<D>__{you are too concerned with what was and what will be. there is a saying: yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. that is why it is called the present.}
<A>__{oogway hits the tree with his staff as he walks away and a peach falls into po's open hand.}
