<L>__{exterior bridge. manhattan. day}
<A>__{michael rides in a taxi into manhattan. a view of the familiar skyline.}
<L>__{exterior fifth avenue. day}
<A>__{michael's taxi comes up fifth avenue. it draws up outside an expensive apartment block. michael gets out and goes in, the manhattan skyline opening up behind him.}
<L>__{interior living room. ilana's apartment. day}
<A>__{a superbly appointed space full of great and expensive art. michael has taken his coat off. ilana mather appears, elegant, well dressed on the surface, the spirit of prosperous new york. she is now in her early fifties.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{ms mather?}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{yes. you're michael berg. i was expecting you.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{so you must tell me: what exactly brings you to the united states?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i was already here. i was at a conference in boston.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{you're a lawyer?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{i was intrigued by your letter but i can't say i wholly understood it. you attended the trial?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yes. almost twenty years ago. i was a law student. i remember you, i remember your mother very clearly.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{my mother died in israel a good many years ago.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{michael hesitates for a moment.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{go on, please.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{perhaps you heard. hanna schmitz recently died. she killed herself.}
<A>__{ilana shakes her head.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{she was a friend of yours?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{a kind of friend. it's as simple as this. hanna was illiterate for the greater part of her life.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{is that an explanation of her behaviour?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{or an excuse?}
<A>__{michael shakes his head.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no. no. she taught herself to read when she was in prison. i sent her tapes. she'd always liked being read to.}
<A>__{ilana shifts slightly.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{why don't you start by being honest with me? at least start that way. what was the nature of your friendship?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{when i was young i had an affair with hanna.}
<A>__{ilana looks at him for a moment.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{i'm not sure i can help you, mr. berg. or rather, even if i could i'm not willing to.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i was almost sixteen when i took up with her. the affair only lasted a summer. but.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{but what?}
<A>__{michael just looks at her.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{i see. and did hanna schmitz acknowledge the effect she'd had on your life?}
<A>__{michael stares back, understood for the first time.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she'd done much worse to other people. i've never told anyone.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{people ask all the time what i learned in the camps. but the camps weren't therapy. what do you think these places were? universities? we didn't go there to learn. one becomes very clear about these things.}
<A>__{ilana looks at him, unrelenting.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{what are you asking for? forgiveness for her? or do you just want to feel better yourself? my advice, go to the theatre, if you want catharsis. please. go to literature. don't go to the camps. nothing comes out of the camps. nothing.}
<A>__{ilana looks at him, unrelenting.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what she wanted...what she wanted was to leave you her money. i have with me.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{to do what?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{as you think fit.}
<A>__{michael reaches for his briefcase. he takes out the lavender tea tin, which he sets down on the table in front of ilana.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{ilana lifts the tin.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{when i was a little girl, i had a tea tin for my treasures. not quite like this. it had cyrillic lettering. i took it with me to the camp, but it got stolen.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what was in it?}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{oh. sentimental things. a piece of hair from our dog. some tickets to operas my father had taken me to. it wasn't stolen for its contents. it was the tin itself which was valuable, what you could do with it.}
<A>__{she sits a moment, overcome, her hand on the tin.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{there's nothing i can do with this money. if i give it to anything associated with the extermination of the jews, then to me it will seem like absolution and that is something i'm neither willing nor in a position to grant.}
<A>__{michael nods slightly.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i was thinking maybe an organization to encourage literacy.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{there's a silence.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{do you know if there's a jewish organization?}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{i will be surprised if there isn't. there's a jewish organisation for everything. not that illiteracy is a very jewish problem.}
<A>__{there is the shadow of a smile.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{why don't you find out? send them the money.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{shall i do it in hanna's name?}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{as you think fit.}
<A>__{ilana smiles slightly. she puts her hand on top of the tin.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{i will keep the tin.}
