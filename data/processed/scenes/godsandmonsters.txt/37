<L>__{interior harry's beachcomber night}
<A>__{the place is dead. there's only clay and dwight sitting at the bar with the owner, harry, a balding hep cat with a scraggly tuft of beard. and, in a booth, kid saylor, a cocky 20 year old, necking with a pony tailed teenager.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i liked it. you learn stuff listening to old timers.}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(to harry)}
<D>__{you ever hear of this whale fellow?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{can't say that i have. can't say i've heard of a lot of people though.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{if you don't believe me, let's watch this movie. see if his name's on it. how about it, harry? can i watch my damn movie?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i told you. i don't turn on the tv except for the fights.}
<A>__{betty cartwright appears behind the bar, lugging a bucket of ice from the storeroom. she's an attractive woman in her early 30s, big boned and almost as tall as clay.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{a spooky movie. just what this place needs tonight.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{couldn't make it any deader, doll. set me up.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{sure. your friend want one?}
<A>__{clay reacts to the silent treatment with a tight smile.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{yeah, one for what's his name here.}
<A>__{she sets down two bottles of pabst without looking at clay.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{thanks, doll.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(to harry)}
<D>__{i say let loverboy watch his movie. and be grateful boone's not cutting shirley temple's lawn.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{why is everybody giving me crap tonight?}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{jesus, boone. you come in here proud as a peacock because some old coot wants to paint your picture. we're just bringing you back to earth.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{sounds screwy to me. i can't imagine a real artist wanting to spend time looking at that kisser.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{this kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{ooooh.}
<A>__{betty glares at clay, who realizes he's gone too far.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i bet this is just some fruit pretending to be famous. so he can get in the big guy's pants.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{ooooh.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what makes you say that?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{just thinking out loud.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{all right, then. he's interested in you for your conversation. we know what a great talker you are.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{not anymore you don't. doll.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(explodes)}
<D>__{we're watching the movie, harry. you got that! we are watching my fucking movie.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{calm down, clay. just calm down. we'll watch it.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{good. fine.}
<A>__{harry reaches up, turns on a battered motorola. on the tv, a voice announces: "tonight, boris karloff in 'the bride of frankenstein.'" the titles come on. ending with the phrase "directed by", which floats over a white blob. the blob jumps forward to form letters: "james whale."}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{right there. what did i tell you? james whale.}
<A>__{the movie starts. the monster being roasted alive in the flaming wreckage of a mill.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{this looks corny.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{go wash glasses if you don't like it.}
<A>__{in a flooded crater under the mill, the monster kills an old man. he climbs up, flips the man's wife into the pit below. an owl blinks impassively.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{not bad. two down and it's just started.}
<A>__{minnie, a hatchet faced woman with fluttering ribbons, is now alone with the monster.}
