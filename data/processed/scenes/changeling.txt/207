<L>__{interior interview room viewing room night}
<A>__{as the interview continues. david nods.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{that's the last i saw of any of 'em.}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{so you don't know if either of the other two were captured?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no. all i know is, if he hadn't come back for me...i don't think i ever would've gotten out of there.}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{what happened after that?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i hid in the woods for two days, too scared to move, because i was sure they'd find me. i finally started walking, but every time a car came up i was afraid it was them. so i kept off the main roads until i saw a train stopped at a crossing, and i jumped in.}
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{why didn't you tell anyone what had happened?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i was afraid! i thought they'd come after me, or my folks...so i didn't tell anybody. i was on my own until i got a free meal from this lady, mrs. lansing. i told her i was an orphan, on my own. she said i could stay on, and...i did.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{every night, i'd wake up, thinking they were right outside my window. then i heard the police talking on the radio about what happened at the ranch, and i thought, for sure i can't go back now.}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{since i didn't tell anybody what happened, i was afraid they'd blame me for those kids being dead. so i just...stayed away.}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{so what made you come forward now, after all this time?}
<A>__{david looks away, his eyes tearing up. finally:}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i miss my mom...i miss my dad...i just...i just want to go home.}
<A>__{and it's all mrs. clay can take. sobbing, she runs out of the viewing room and into the interview room, where she goes to her son and embraces him, holds him, the two crying into one another's arms.}
