<A>__{he realizes he doesn't know the words at all. he switches channels. finds a rush song, with ornate lyrics. no one will ever know what the words are. he switches again and finds "let's groove tonight" by earth, wind and fire. excellent. he begins singing nonsense noises, passionately. switches again. all he wants is to sing along with a song he knows. finally he finds tom petty and the heartbreakers' "refugee." he drives through the countryside, singing the call and response of the song, like a happy idiot.}
