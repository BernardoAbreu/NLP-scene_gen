<A>__{lt. haans sits at his desk, sensing someone over his shoulder. he turns to find sgt. helm, a sheet of paper in his trembling hands.}
<C>__{helm}
<D>__{the fuhrer is dead.}
<A>__{skeptical, haans snatches the paper from helm. when he looks up, the entire staff is looking at him, some with tears in their eyes others perhaps hiding a sense of relief. a phone rings. then another. the chattering teletypes seem to surge into another gear as news of hitler's death starts to spread. long pause. haans struggles with the sheer size of the moment.}
<C>__{haans}
<D>__{you all know your jobs. get to work.}
<A>__{zombie like, the operators go back to their teletypes, passing orders along. but one operator the one helm asked to keep him informed notices something strange about one order in a stack of many he is sifting through.}
<C>__{operator}
<D>__{sergeant. this order is signed by witzleben.}
<C>__{helm}
<P>__{(taking the paper)}
<D>__{that's ridiculous. he`s not even in the army anymore.}
<A>__{but sure enough, there is witzleben's name. strange. helm looks over at the devastated haans, wondering how to handle this. then, like a good little nazi:}
<C>__{helm }
