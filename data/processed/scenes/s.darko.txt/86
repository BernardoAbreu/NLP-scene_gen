<L>__{interior motel room 15 evening}
<A>__{sam swallows her pills with some water, and sits down on one of the full size beds by her backpack... she reaches inside and pulls out the philosophy of time travel book, by roberta sparrow. as she studies the cover, her image is reflected by the closet door mirrors. the angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for other objects in the room... and sam's reflection is present in both of the panes. the digital clock radio shows 6:30 pm... she looks at the pictures of her family tucked away inside the book: sam with her mother and father; sam as a child with her sister and brother; an old photo of the whole darko family together... tears come to her eyes as she focuses on an image of donnie, and she puts them all down. she touches the scar on the inner part of her right wrist... she then glances down and notices that the book is open to: chapter nine remnants.}
