<A>__{the two stewards enter. they have electric torches and play the beams around the hold. they spot the renault with its fogged up rear window and approach it slowly. from inside we see the torch light up rose's passionate handprint, still there on the fogged up glass. one steward whips open the door.}

<A>__{rose and jack, fully dressed, come through a crew door onto the deck. they can barely stand, they are laughing so hard. up above them, in the crow's nest, lookout fleet hears the disturbance below and looks around and back down to the well deck, where he can see two figures embracing. jack and rose stand in each others arms. their breath clouds around them in the now freezing air, but they don't even feel the cold.}
