<D>__{she's playing with us tonight. fuse set?}
<A>__{elijah nods. pk holds his hand out for the cheesa stick. elijah lights the flare. he goes to hand it to pk. pk notices elijah's hands shaking. he sees the fear in elijah's eyes.}

<D>__{one... two... three.}
<A>__{a muffled blast comes from the other side of the hangup deep in the stope. pk freezes, confused, and then a second blast goes off. the hangups starts to give. and}
<B>__{another blast.}
<A>__{pk lights his own fuse and runs like hell over the bars toward the tunnel. the hangup, loosened by the explosions inside, gives before pk's bomb ignites. the rock is crashing down. pk races the rock. the tunnel is within sight. the men yell for him to jump. pk is about to leap when a rock hits the bar, bounces up, and catches him in the stomach. he loses his balance and goes over the side as the hangup comes crashing down. pk hits the wall of the lower funnel once, twice and then lands in the soft stuff the shale flake, cushioning the steel doors below.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{against the wall of rock. a rock ledge carelessly left when the funnel was originally built. pk rolls under it. a moment later fifty tons of ore in large chunks and small chunks and dust comes crashing down, burying pk. he lays there, semiconscious, buried but alive.}
