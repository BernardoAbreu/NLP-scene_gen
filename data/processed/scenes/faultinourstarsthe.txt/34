<L>__{int hazel's bedroom later that night}
<A>__{hazel sits at her computer, van houten's assistant's email address staring her in the face. the cursor blinks on a blank page. and then hazel starts writing...}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{"dear mr. peter van houten, my name is hazel grace lancaster. my friend augustus waters, who read your book at my recommendation just received an email from you at this address. i hope you will not mind that he shared that email with me."}
<A>__{while hazel reads the letter, we see a series of scenes showing the next several days. they include: hazel and gus drinking coffees at a cafe. he's enthusiastically telling a story and she's enjoying every moment of it. hazel helping gus become a better driver. it's no use.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{"i was wondering if you wouldn't mind answering a few questions i have about what happens after the end of the book. specifically, the following:"}
<A>__{ in his kitchen, laughing, trying to make omelettes.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{"does anna's mom marry the dutch tulip man; is the dutch tulip man up to something or is he just misunderstood? what happens to anna's friends?}
<A>__{ watching tv. their bodies almost touching. but not quite.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{lastly, i was hoping you could shed some light on sisyphus the hamster. these questions have haunted me for years. and i don't know how long i have left to get answers to them."}
<A>__{and finally, back in hazel's bedroom. she finishes reading this letter into the phone.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{"i know these are not important literary questions and that your book is full of important literary questions, but i would just really like to know."}
