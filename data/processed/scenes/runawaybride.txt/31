<L>__{interior maggie's house that moment}
<A>__{maggie skips back into her house which she shares with father and grandma. a cozy and eclectic place creatively furnished on a shoe string. she rushes into: kitchen where bob kelly, fiance #4, is packing cans into a backpack. bob, 38, has a pleasant face and a body that is almost shockingly buff. he's wearing a t shirt that reads: "mountaineers do it against the wall.", maggie dances over, waving the paper and singing.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{she canned him, she canned him... bob test the weight of the backpack adding dehydrate food.}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{come here, mag, and try this on. maggie puts the paper on the kitchen counter and starts to read aloud, paying no mind to bob, who is sticking her arms through the straps of the backpack.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{listen: "dear ms. carpenter, i apologize to you for this unfortunate matter. ike graham's column will no longer be appearing in this paper. best of luck in you upcoming marriage!" bob continues to hold up the weight of the backpack as he straps it onto maggie's shoulders.}
<C>__{bob}
<A>__{that a girl! you sacked him.}
<P>__{(checking pack)}
<A>__{this is the weight of the pack you're going to have to carry in the himalayas. tell me if it's too heavy. bob lets go and maggie falls backward, disappearing behind the counter, and hitting the floor, with a thud. bob looks down at her. maggie's voice rises from the floor behind the counter.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{it's a little... it's a little heavy... help me, baby. bob has no answer. he reaches a hand down. he yelps as maggie pulls him down on top of her, out of frame. we hear them giggle and kiss.}
