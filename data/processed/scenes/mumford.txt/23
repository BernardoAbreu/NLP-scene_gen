<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{(doesn't really know him)}
<D>__{mr. cook.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{could you come with me please?}
<A>__{mystified, mumford follows cook through the door into the back. back of the store. cook motions for mumford to take the seat of honor in the work area, but mumford prefers to stand. cook has a little trouble figuring how to start. finally }
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{i know i shoulda come to your office. i was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{it's my daughter sofie... she's gotta problem.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{we're not sure. she's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. some of 'em are callin' it }
<P>__{(wants to get this right)}
<D>__{ epstein barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... chronic fatigue symptom...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{syndrome... chronic fatigue syndrome.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{that's it syndrome. so you know all about it?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{no... a little. there's a lot of debate about it.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{yeah, i got that. some people think it's all in their heads.}
<P>__{(more intense)}
<D>__{it's been so bad she's had to move back here to mumford and live with us. and i'm not sure that's the best thing, either...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{oh... a lot of things. several different factors. will you see her, doctor mumford?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{sure. why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.}
<A>__{cook nods, but looks worried.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{i'm not sure she'll come. she's in a mood. do you ever go to somebody's house?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{generally that doesn't work out so well. it sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.}
<A>__{cook is quick to agree; he doesn't want to make waves. but he's worried.}
