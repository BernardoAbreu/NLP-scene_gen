<A>__{ray stacks shelves with a knock off version of plastic "my little pony" in a messy aisle of boxes. matt, 22, her boss, bone thin with bad skin walks by.}

<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{matt. could i talk to you?}
<A>__{he looks at her.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{i need to come on full time.}
<A>__{matt blinks with a blank expression then:}

<D>__{i see you as a short timer.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{a short timer. not here for long, not really committed.}
<A>__{ray follows him to the stock room.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{when i started you said it would be six months before i could come on full time. and that was two years ago.}
<A>__{he opens a can of red bull and takes a sip.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it's my opinion.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{well, i mean, you know, i do show up. pat's late everyday. she's late now. she's always late.}
<A>__{he stares blankly at her. she can think of nothing else to say. he walks out. ray resumes unpacking ponies. a moment later pat, 22, rushes in, looking sorry. as pat hangs up her coat, ray glimpses a tatoo just above her low riding pants with the words "how you doin'?". ray takes the last of her cigarettes out of the pack and heads out the back door.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{see ya' tomorrow.}
