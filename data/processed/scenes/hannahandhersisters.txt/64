<A>__{...as the camera leaves the musicians and moves to the conversatively dressed audience. a far cry from the rock club atmosphere, the carlyle is quiet except for bobby short's singing. the audience at their tables watch him, some with smiles of pleasure. a man has his arm around a woman. jewels sparkle in another woman's hair. the men wear suits. mickey and holly sit at one of the tables; a candle burns in its holder on the tabletop. holly takes a cigarette from her purse as she holds her hand to her nose, sniffing. mickey keeps shooting glances at holly; she can't sit still. bobby short continues to sing...}

<D>__{"i'm in love again hear my heart strings strummin' i'm in love again and the hymn they're hummin' is those cuddle up huddle up blues i'm in love again and i can't rise above it..."}
<A>__{...as holly lights her cigarette, dropping her matchbook on the floor. she bends down to pick it up, then starts to fidget in her chair. she gulps her wine; she sniffs. mickey tries to watch the offscreen bobby short; he crosses his arms across his chest. the film cuts back briefly to bobby short playing the piano...}

<P>__{(singing, continuing)}
