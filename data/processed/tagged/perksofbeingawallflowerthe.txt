<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{high school? bullshit. the cafeteria is called the nutrition center. and people wear their letter jackets even when it's 98 degrees out. and why do they give out letters for marching band? that's not a sport, and we all know it.}

<D>__{this kid is crazy.}

<D>__{i'm guessing you've never been high before?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{me? no. my best friend michael. his dad was a big drinker. so, he hated all that stuff. parties, too.}

<C>__{dr. burton}
<D>__{what's hurting you?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no! not me. it's them. it's everyone. it never stops. do you understand?}
<A>__{dr. burton smiles, sympathetic. charlie nods, relieved that someone finally understands. until...}
<C>__{dr. burton}
<D>__{what about your aunt helen?}
<A>__{like cold water. what was tears is now confusion and soon to be shame. dr. burton is gentle to him.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what about her?}
<C>__{dr. burton}
<D>__{can you see her?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yes, she had a terrible life. but... i mean, what am i...}
<C>__{dr. burton}
<D>__{you said some things about her in your sleep.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<C>__{dr. burton}
<D>__{if you want to get better, you have to }
<A>__{charlie looks at her, nodding her encouragement.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{she was... insane.}
<A>__{the minute he says one word of truth, he feels ashamed. he stops talking. dr. burton does not press him. not today.}
<C>__{dr. burton}
<D>__{charlie, are you going to let me help you here?}
<A>__{charlie cries and nods.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{dr. burton}
<D>__{do you remember anything before you blacked out?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i, uh... i remember leaving sam's house, and walking home...}
<A>__{we move away from them as charlie's voice trails off.}
<L>__{interior hospital room morning}
<A>__{the sun creeps through the windows. we can hear birds outside. the intercom is quiet. charlie is alone. he looks at sam's typewriter. "dear friend" is already typed.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i was in the hospital for awhile. i won't go into detail about all of it. but i will say there were some very bad days. and some unexpected beautiful days.}
<A>__{charlie picks up a get well card from sam.}
<L>__{interior hospital hallway day}
<A>__{dr. burton walks charlie's parents down the hallway.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{the worst day was the time my doctor told my mom and dad what aunt helen did to me.}
<A>__{in the distance, we see charlie's mom and dad stop. shocked.}
<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{charlie looks up and sees his mom and dad in the doorway.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{honey?}
<A>__{his mother comes to hold him.}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{i'm so sorry.}
<A>__{for a second, we see the emotion his father hides behind the sports page, before he chokes it down. he walks over to his son and kisses his forehead.}
<L>__{interior hospital room morning}
<A>__{charlie, chris, and candace sit on the bed, playing cards.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{the best days were those when i could have visitors. my brother and sister always came for those until chris had to go to training camp. he's going to be first string this year. and my sister told me she met a nice guy at her summer job.}
<L>__{interior hospital hallway afternoon}
<A>__{charlie leaves his room with his suitcase in hand. his mother waits in the hallway with dr. burton.}
<C>__{dr. burton}
<D>__{there he is. so, i will see you thursday at 6, right?}
<A>__{charlie nods and leaves the hospital with his mother.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{my doctor said we can't choose where we can come from, but we can choose where we go from there. i know it's not all the answers, but it was enough to start putting these pieces together.}
<A>__{dr. burton smiles, then turns back into the hospital.}
<L>__{interior charlie's dining room night}
<A>__{the family sits at the dinner table.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{god bless this food that we are about to receive. we thank you for this bounty in the name of our lord jesus christ. amen.}
<A>__{after they say "amen," the room falls silent. the family is on pins and needles. no one touches their food. until...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{how do you think the penguins are going to do this year, dad?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{god damn penguins. i think they're allergic to god damn defense.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what do the players call a puck again?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{a biscuit.}
<C>__{candace}
<D>__{are you sure it's not a "god damn biscuit?"}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{you're cruisin' for a bruisin'.}
<A>__{as things return to normal, dad picks up his paper. candace talks about the books she'll need for college. everyone starts eating. and charlie smiles, happy to just be home.}
<L>__{interior charlie's house dusk}
<A>__{ding dong. the door opens to reveal patrick, smiling.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{can charlie come out and play?}
<A>__{charlie's mother smiles. charlie smiles, too. especially when he sees... sam. standing next to patrick. her hair a little different. her eyes alive and happy.}
<L>__{interior kings family restaurant night}
<A>__{the gang of three sit at their booth. sam and patrick have their coffee. charlie has his brownie. like always.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that first night, i had grilled stickies. it was so good. you have to visit in the fall. we'll have some. okay?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{definitely.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{sorry, sam. charlie has a breakdown scheduled for october.}
<A>__{charlie laughs. sam smiles. after a beat...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well, can i tell you something? i've been away for two months. it's another world. and it gets better.}
<P>__{(off charlie's smile)}
<D>__{and my roommate katie has the best taste in music.}
<A>__{sam puts a cassette tape down on the table.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i found the tunnel song.}
<A>__{charlie looks at sam and patrick, who smile.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{let's drive.}
<L>__{exterior kings family restaurant night}
<A>__{the three leave the restaurant and jump into sam's truck. patrick drives. charlie in the middle. sam the passenger.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i don't know if i will have the time to write any more letters because i might be too busy trying to participate. so, if this does end up being the last letter, i just want you to know that i was in a bad place before i started high school. and you helped me.}
<L>__{interior sam's truck night}
<A>__{the three friends are flying down the highway in sam's truck. the music blaring. the wind making their hair dance.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{even if you didn't know what i was talking about. or know someone who's gone through it. it made me not feel alone.}
<A>__{with sam's help, charlie climbs through the little window}
<L>__{exterior highway 376 north night}
<A>__{charlie gets into the back of the truck. he sits down, looking back at the highway. watching everywhere he's been.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{because i know there are people who say all of these things don't happen. and there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17.}
<A>__{we see charlie in profile. the night sky behind him until...}
<L>__{interior fort pitt tunnel night}
<A>__{... they enter the tunnel, and we realize just how fast they're driving. the white tiles of the tunnel whiz by at blinding speed. a perfect night. a perfect drive. flying.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i know these will all be stories someday. and our pictures will become old photographs. and we'll all become somebody's mom or dad. but right now, these moments are not stories.}
<A>__{charlie turns to face forward. to the moment. to sam, smiling at him from the front seat.}
<D>__{charlie (v.o) (cont'd) this is happening. i am here. and i am looking at her. and she is so beautiful.}
<A>__{sam kisses charlie. then, she turns, and all three kids look ahead to everything in front of them. charlie begins to stand in the back of the truck. ready to leave the tunnel.}
<D>__{charlie (v.o.) (cont'd) i can see it. this one moment when you know you're not a sad story. you are alive. and as you stand up and see the lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder. and you are listening to that song on that drive with the people you love most in this world.}
<A>__{charlie stands in the back of the truck. the wind on his face. he is free.}
<D>__{charlie (v.o.) (cont'd) and in this moment, i swear...}
<A>__{we see the moment as charlie sees it. the tunnel's exit getting bigger and brighter with the lights of the city behind it.}
<D>__{charlie (v.o.) (cont'd) ... we are infinite.}
<A>__{the tunnel song blasts over the speakers as the truck flies out of the tunnel. sam and patrick scream with excitement. charlie holds his arms in the air. the weight of the world gone. if only for a moment. this one moment. we see the city. a million lights like white stars in a glass dome. we crane to the sky. we are in heaven.}
