<L>__{interior coffee shop day}
<A>__{the only place the small town has to offer is a deserted coffee shop on the shorefront. hector, betsy and thomas sit at a corner table, beyond them through the window is the beach and the ocean.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{sure you won't have a pancake, betsy?}
<A>__{betsy gets impatient.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{okay, first question?}
<A>__{the kids are ready for this. there is no coyness now.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{where have you been?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{what he means is why did you stay away?}
<A>__{hector begins like a story teller embarking on a long saga.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{well, that's a fair question... your mother and i got divorced... you're big enough to remember... she must have told you all that?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{sure she has... but lots of people get divorced... that doesn't mean they disappear...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you're right... what can i tell you... i went kind of crazy after that, for a good while... i came around a few times... remember?}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{not really.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{well, it wasn't easy... everything with her and donald happened pretty quickly. i missed you both really badly... but for a while i thought i should stay away, until your mother got settled... no, that's not really true... i missed you... but i was kind of crazy at the same time... your mother and i married young... i wasn't used to the freedom... it went to my head ... then you moved to new jersey.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{it's forty minutes away on a slow bus...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you're right, you're right. i don't have too many excuses for the first year... the second year is easier... i was in jail.}
<A>__{hector is pleased with this. a solid excuse.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{we were doing government work, big contracts... there were some temptations... my boss asked me to shuffle a few papers... there was a lot of money in it... i had to testify against him... it was like killing somebody.}
<A>__{hector thinks about this, remembering the pain. for us there is the echo of the real killing that was done long ago.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{thomas wanted to visit you in jail, but mom wouldn't let him.}
<A>__{hector looks at thomas.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you did?}
<A>__{thomas nods proudly.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{well i appreciate that... but i'm glad your mother didn't let you. i will tell you all about it some day. it was no fun. one year and eight months.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{we didn't even know when you got out.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i wasn't in great shape... i sure didn't want you to see me then... so i got back to work... in real estate... found a partner, we met in jail...}
<A>__{the kids look shocked at this.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{no. he's a good man, a good man. i like him. i mean it. he's my friend.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{that's what you do now?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{yes. we rent apartments... but we want to get into commercial property... people are a nuisance... does that sound bad?}
<A>__{betsy shrugs her shoulders.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{how should i know?}
<A>__{hector carries on with his story.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{just recently i've been feeling good, things have been going well... and i missed you two... so here we are...}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{what about your girl friend?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{who told you about her?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{nobody.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{anna... she's nice... she wants to meet you, real soon... she sells flowers... well, you know that... and on monday she's probably going to kill me...}
<A>__{the kids smile.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{betsy thinks that was her at the gas station...}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{shut up, tom...}
<A>__{hector has to think to remember.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{no... heck... no... did you think she was following us?}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{she's always thinking up stories like that... she never stops...}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{well, if people don't tell you things...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{she's right, thomas... people should talk more.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{so you haven't been staying away because of us?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{what do you mean? is that what you thought? i was avoiding you two? no... you mustn't think that... that's terrible...}
<A>__{they have almost exhausted themselves in this first bout of talking. hector looks out at the sea.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{the rain's off. let's go.}
