<A>__{watery, full. the focus shifts to the medallion, dangling in its center... the last thing robin sees before his eyes close into troubled sleep. the white moon against the black sky...}

<B>__{its negative image}
<A>__{ a black circle against a white sky. an executioner. the round medallion has become a noose. in the noose appears wulf's face. the executioner hauls on the rope and wulf's features contort in the agony of death. another noose, another face... duncan. another bull. another marian.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{kiss me, robin.}
<A>__{the noose tightens on her neck. as she dies, her face shrivels into the cackling features of mortianna. next, robin's father. he stares accusingly right at us.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{why have you betrayed me? why?}
<A>__{before he pulls the rope, the executioner peels back his hood... it is robin. gloating, he hauls on the rope. his laughter blends with that of mortianna in a hideous cacophony.}
