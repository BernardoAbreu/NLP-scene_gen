<L>__{interior night. thornfield second floor.}
<A>__{jane wakes. her curtains are open; moonlight spilling in. she hears it again; the laugh from her dream, right outside her door low and deep.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{who's there?}
<A>__{footsteps run away. jane springs out of bed and pulls the door open. a door shuts at the end of the corridor. there is a single candle burning in its holder on the rush matting, flickering in the draft. jane picks it up. she notices something else a curling wreath of grey smoke. she follows its trail through the pitch darkness. it is coming thickly from a half open door at the front of the house rochester's. jane rushes in. rochester's bed is on fire; the hangings, the curtains, all are alight. the flames are leaping. rochester is asleep. she shakes him.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{wake up! wake up! sir!}
<A>__{rochester only stirs. the smoke has stupefied him. jane pulls the burning sheets off then stops; he is naked. she takes his basin and douses the bed soaking him.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{who's there?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{it is i, jane eyre, sir.}
<A>__{jane takes the ewer and throws water on the curtains. she pulls the soggy fabric from its rail and smothers the burning couch. when all the flames are out, she rushes to the windows and opens them. smoke billows out. she stands in the moonlight, coughing. rochester is sitting up, staring at her.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{what in the name of all the elves in christendom have you done with me?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{for heaven's sake get up. somebody has plotted something; you must find out who. i will light the lamp }
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{light the lamp at your peril.}
<A>__{rochester is springing out of bed. jane turns away, mortified having caught sight of his silhouetted shape.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i heard a laugh outside my door loud enough to wake me. i opened it. someone was running towards the third floor.}
<A>__{rochester is putting on a dressing gown, lighting the lamp.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{and a candle was left burning in the middle of the floor. shall i fetch mrs fairfax, sir?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{what the deuce can she do?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{then i will wake john and martha.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{not at all. stay here. you're shivering.}
<A>__{rochester gets his coat and puts it round her.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{i have to go to the third floor. don't make a sound. sit there. i shan't be long.}
<A>__{he goes. jane looks at his ruined chamber; the blackened drapes on the four poster bed, the fireplace, the huge wardrobe. it is not unlike the red room.}
