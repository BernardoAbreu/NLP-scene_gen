<L>__{interior living room dusk}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{help! no, no, no, no...}
<A>__{the little voice hidden behind all the static screams.}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(screaming back)}
<D>__{run carol anne! run away!!}
<A>__{close ryan his eyes light up. close monitors and readbacks come to life and start registering wildly. diane can’t stand the screams. she holds her ears, in tears now, imploring dr. lesh with her eyes.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{carol anne! oh god!!}
<A>__{steve holds diane to him, she pushes away and screams at the ceiling.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{you fucking bastard, she’s just a baby!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{mommy! mommy!}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(screaming through tears to dr. lesh)}
<D>__{help her! can’t you hear what’s happening?!}
<A>__{we hear soft footsteps running across the ceiling and down the wall. two lamps are turned over and smash to pieces on the library table. we next hear colossal footfalls booming in pursuit. a gust of interior wind races through diane’s clothes and hair. she screams in combined joy and horror.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{she just moved through me. my god, i felt her. i can smell her! she went through my soul!!}
<A>__{diane runs back to steve and grabs his shirt, pulling him to her.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{smell my clothes. it’s her. it’s her all over me.}
<A>__{steve smells and can’t believe it.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{it is her!!}
<A>__{the footsteps in pursuit grow louder. diane turns to face the sound. dr. lesh turns. steve and ryan turn. a perfectly foul smell precedes an implosion of displaced air. almost the sound of thunder, the impact is so great. lesh, diane and steve blow backward, their clothes flapping in the gale as the force passes through each one of them and out the picture window that cracks in a dozen places but does not shatter.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<P>__{(picking herself up)}
<D>__{have you ever heard of the term “teleportation”?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{carol anne!}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{that’s like when mr. spock beams up captain kirk on “star trek”.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{just about. in a recent case, objects which disappeared from a house would be seen much later falling to the ground outside.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{carol anne doesn’t answer. steve?}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<P>__{(to steve)}
<D>__{where exactly do you suppose carol anne was playing before she vanished from sight?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{her bedroom closet. and she wasn’t playing.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{let’s go up there.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{it won’t let you in.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{we’ll just see about that.}
<A>__{lesh practically rolls up her sleeves and heads for the stairway, the rest following.}
