<L>__{exterior sea day}
<A>__{the sun is rising on a rough sea. the committee boat is anchored in the open sea, 600 feet above the sea bed.}
<L>__{exterior committee boat bay of taormina day}
<A>__{jacques who is on the foredeck of a boat at sea has just laid a towel down before him. he's suited up, sitting in the lotus position, staring straight ahead, clearly self hypnotized. johana, novelli, and other officials are in the stern of the boat watching last minute preparations. the scuba divers in brightly colored wetsuits and aqualungs, flop out onto the diving platform, plunge into the water, disappear.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{what are they for?}
<C>__{novelli}
<D>__{they're paramedics. they wait at 180 feet.}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(just checking)}
<D>__{if there was a problem, they could do something right?}
<C>__{novelli}
<D>__{of course, that's what they're for.}
<A>__{johana sees scuba divers with weird air tanks.}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{... and those?}
<C>__{novelli}
<D>__{those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet. they dive with a helium oxygen mixture. at that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{what's that little air bottle on the machine?}
<C>__{novelli}
<D>__{that isn't for the divers actually. it's for the balloon. it blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator. without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{but doesn't jacques dive without anything?}
<C>__{novelli}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{yes... it's magic.}
