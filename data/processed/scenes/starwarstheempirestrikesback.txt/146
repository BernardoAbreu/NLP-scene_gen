<L>__{exterior asteroid cave millennium falcon}
<A>__{the pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid cave. it is so dark that the cave's exact dimensions are impossible to determine.}
<L>__{interior millennium falcon cockpit}
<A>__{han and chewie busily shut down the engine and all electronic systems. threepio and leia watch worriedly.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{sir, i'm almost afraid to ask, but... does that include shutting me down, too?}
<A>__{chewie barks "yes". but han thinks otherwise.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{no, i need you to talk to the falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.}
<A>__{suddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit to go flying. chewie howls.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{not entirely stable? i'm glad you're here to tell us these things. chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{oh! sometimes i just don't understand human behavior. after all, i'm only trying to do my job in the most...}
<A>__{the sliding door closes behind the indignant threepio as chewie and he move back to the hold. suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing leia across the cabin into han's arms. then, abruptly, the motion stops as suddenly as it started. with some surprise, han and leia realize they are in each other's arms.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{let go.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{sshh!}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{let go, please.}
<A>__{leia flushes, averting her eyes. she's not exactly fighting to get free. but, of course, han blows it...}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{don't get excited.}
<A>__{the anger rises in leia.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{sorry, sweetheart. we haven't got time for anything else.}
<A>__{han grins quickly wickedly at leia as he turns and exits through the door. leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face.}
