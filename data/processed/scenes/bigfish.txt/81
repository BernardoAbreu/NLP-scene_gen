<L>__{interior big top night}
<A>__{a troupe of stilt walking firebreathers finishes their act to tremendous applause. as the performers clear away, the circus' owner and ringmaster amos calloway (50) approaches the stands. he may only be four feet tall, but amos has a titanic presence.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, you may think you've seen the unusual. you may think you've seen the bizarre. but i've travelled to the five corners of the world, and let me tell you, i've never seen anything like this.}
<A>__{from behind amos, carnies start rolling a massive ball towards the crowd.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{when i found this man, he was picking oranges in florida. his fellow workers called him el penumbra the shadow because when you were working beside him, he blocked out the daylight. he could take a whole tree in his hands and shake off the fruit. i had to pay his crew boss $10,000 just so i could take him with me.}
<A>__{amos comes up to a middle aged woman in the first row, a quieter moment.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{not to alarm you, ma'am. but if this man wanted to, he could crush your head between his toes.}
<P>__{(she trembles)}
<D>__{but he won't.}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{he's not going to hurt her, folks, because he's our own gentle giant. ladies and gentlemen, i give you colossus!}
<A>__{the carnies back away from the ball as a deep drum roll begins. a moment, then the ball starts to bulge from inside. a foot suddenly bursts out from within. gasps from the crowd. that foot is massive. in the stands, edward looks closer. intrigued. as the drum beat intensifies, a second foot breaks out. followed by hands. shoulders. finally, the head. this is}
<B>__{colossus.}
<A>__{from a very low angle, we look up to see just how massive he is. he seems to fill the heavens. with his shaved head and giant club, he seems more ogre than man. in the bandstands, a young boy's jaw drops in awe. colossus walks down the row, letting the crowd get a better look at him. some reach out to touch him, disbelieving. a tight spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd. colossus passes edward, who seems unimpressed. he leans with the spotlight, whistling to get the big man's attention. he points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is sitting on the dirt }
<B>__{karl the giant}
<A>__{stands up, so big the spotlight has to widen just to hold him. he's a good foot taller than colossus. there's a gasp from the crowd, along with nervous anticipation what will happen next? angle on amos, stunned, megaphone dangling. angle on colossus, realizing the gig is up. with a resigned shrug, he rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into the shadows.}
