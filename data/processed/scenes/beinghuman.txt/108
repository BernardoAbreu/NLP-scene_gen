<L>__{exterior camp next morning}
<A>__{the officers and dom paulo are selecting items for barter from their crates and boxes of valuables. hector and other notables are also there. cheap goods, a box of rosaries and crucifixes made of common beads, for example, are being gone through and suitable junk selected for gifts. they talk as they work.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{how many are sick?}
<C>__{da cunha}
<D>__{about fifty, sir, some of them very sick indeed. it's the eggs. a couple of the crates were full of rotten ones, but eaten just the same. others just ate too many. it would have been better to ration them, i suppose.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{how wise of you to think of that now. any deaths?}
<C>__{da cunha}
<D>__{six.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{how many eggs did you have?}
<C>__{da cunha}
<D>__{three. i had them boiled.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{i had four. i don't feel well now...}
<C>__{da cunha}
<D>__{four's all right... the really ill ones had eaten eight, ten...}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{let's not think about it... what have you got?}
<A>__{salgado comes forward with a handful of the broken remains of a kettle. copper is a useful currency.}
<C>__{salgado}
<D>__{it worked well... they'll go for this... and nails... luis cleaned up a sackful from the crates...}
<A>__{salgado shows a handful of nails from a small sack in his hand.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{organize some men to gather all the nails they can find. we have to keep control of that particular currency.}
<A>__{dom paulo rummages in a box of cheap rosaries, selects a couple, and then retires to his tent. the others work on at the table. hector drifts off down to the beach.}
