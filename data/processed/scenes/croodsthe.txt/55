<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{seq. 2925 to tomorrow}
<L>__{exterior edge of the world early evening.}
<B>__{on the croods}
<A>__{rushing up the gun sight into the bright rays of the sun.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{hurry! come on. we're gonna make it!}
<A>__{when the croods rush toward "tomorrow," it is a golden, ethereal image created by a perfect alignment of sun, clouds, and mountain. from the croods pov it looks as if they can cross a solid bridge of clouds and climb onto a waiting sun.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{you were right.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{there it is. the sun. we can do it! we can ride it to tomorrow.}
<A>__{even grug is taken with the sight it's there after all. the croods stare at the open meadow across from them. tremors violently shake the ground.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{run!}
<A>__{when the rift opens in front of them, the hot gasses and blasts of hot ash burst the clouds from beneath. the debris shades the sun, revealing a very earthly landscape beyond. from the croods perspective, tomorrow vanished before their eyes. a shockwave knocks a large chunk of rock off the edge the croods are standing on blowing them backwards.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{i don't understand. the sun was right here. it was right here.}
<A>__{kaboom! a gargantuan jet of ash stabs at the sky. ugga pulls the croods away from the ledge. she herds them back toward the gunsight.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{we have to go back to the cave. hurry, hurry, stay together. let's keep moving. move, move! everybody hold my hand. thunk let's go. go! let's stay together.}
<A>__{but grug doesn't join them. instead, grug takes a step toward the precipice, peering into the curtain of ash as if trying to burn a hole straight through it.}
<C>__{ugga }
<D>__{grug? what's wrong with you? grug we'll die if we stay here!}
<A>__{grug spies a wispy shaft of light struggling through the ash cloud. he holds up his hand to feel it. a beam of light settles on his palm. grug is enlightened.}
<C>__{ugga }
<P>__{(softly to grug)}
<D>__{grug. listen to me. we've gotta get back to that cave.}
<A>__{grug looks back at his family huddled, terrified. the picture of what he would have wanted in the beginning. the sight bothers him. grug turns to face them.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{no more dark. no more hiding. no more caves.}
<C>__{beat}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{what's the point of all this?}
<C>__{beat}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{to follow the light.}
<A>__{a smile breaks across eep's face her dad has answered the question.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{i can't change. i don't have ideas. but i have my strength. and right now that's all you need.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{no. we don't know what's over there. maybe nothing. it's too risky.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{it's a chance.}
<A>__{belt wipes a tear off his face.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i will take that chance.}
<A>__{grug lifts guy above his head.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{you know, i've wanted to throw you away ever since i met you.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{heh. that's a joke, right?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{what's a joke?}
<A>__{grug's comment freaks guy out. another angle shows grug with a twinkle in his eye. belt puts on his helmet for safety. with a titanic effort, he hurls guy in to the void. the croods wait an eternity. then a horn sounds.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{he made it... he made it...}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{okay, thunk. your turn.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{you're not coming, are you?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{when you make it, so will i.}
<A>__{grug hurls thunk. ugga kisses grug. she whispers in his ear.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{you did good.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{daddy.}
<A>__{grug wipes a tear from ugga's eye. then lifts her above his head. he hurls her across.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{gran.}
<A>__{gran is next in line.}
<C>__{gran}
<D>__{no mush, just throw me.}
<A>__{grug lifts her above his head.}
<C>__{gran }
<D>__{wait. you surprised me today. lunkhead.}
<A>__{grug smiles and throws her nexterior}
<C>__{gran }
<P>__{(landing on the other side)}
<D>__{still alive!!!}
<A>__{another trembler. more cliff falls away. now the distance is even greater. eep is next in line.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{time to go.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{no. i have too much to say to you. i need to fix everything and i don't have time.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{i can fix it.}
<A>__{grug embraces eep.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{this works good. what do you call it?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{i was thinking of calling it a hug.}
<P>__{(clears his throat)}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{because it rhymes with grug. but you can change it if you want.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{no. i like a "hug."}
<B>__{a beat.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{eep takes in the full effect of her dad's words.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{i...}
<A>__{the ground begins to shake and break apart around them.}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{dad, i'm scared.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{never be afraid.}
<A>__{the gap grows wider. grug lifts eep and makes the greatest throw of his life. the tumult parts briefly. grug can see his entire family safe on the other side. he waves a last goodbye. to his surprise, a shaft of sunlight has settled on his open hand.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{there. i see him!}
<A>__{the family waves to grug to let him know they are okay.}
