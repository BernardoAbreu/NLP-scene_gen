<A>__{smiley, calm and contained, hears the sound of a cab drawing up outside. a pair of footsteps on the path. scrape of a key in the door. a pale rim of light appears around the kitchen door. and outside the sound of a second cab drawing up. someone else enters the house. movement in the kitchen. two men's voices start to speak in russian. smiley gets up, gun in one hand, and guided by the line, makes his way through the darkness to the door of the kitchen, groping, rather like a blind man walking towards the light.}
