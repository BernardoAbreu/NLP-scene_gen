<A>__{we can just make out the barely recognizable figures of the other drivers rushing towards him, as their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully to undo his seatbelt... we notice it is the same drivers that were critical of niki in the driver's meeting. harald ertl, brett lunger, arturo merzario, guy edwards... fire extinguishers blast at the car. covering niki's helmet. filling his lungs with chemicals, along with the smoke and fumes, blurring his vision, as he screams horribly.. the sound of panicked tv commentary in different languages. screaming voices. panicked reactions. then sound fades. as niki blacks out losing consciousness.}
