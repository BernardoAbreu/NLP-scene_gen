<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{the jury once more in the jury box. pan their faces. the faces we saw last night.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{all right, let's say that twine had been there to lash a lantern. that it had come from the shuttle of twine found in the deceased's pocket.}
<A>__{edith twardzik. burke latham. alexander van ness.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{now to re open a trial that had gone to jury...new evidence should be pretty important.}
<A>__{see ishmael. quiet, intense. on the witness stand.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{tell us why that lantern would be so significant.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{well. it shows the prosecutor was wrong. it was carl's boat that was dead in the water. or he'd never have put up the lantern.}
<A>__{nels thinks about that. so the jury will, too.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{now you believe there were two lanterns when defendant arrived. one in carl's hand. the second lashed to the mast.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{that's what mr. miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. he couldn't know that it would help his case.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{well, why does it?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{because the second lantern, the one on the mast. was never found. so we have to ask...}
<A>__{a slight shurg. stating the obvious.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{...where did it go?}
<A>__{and then...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{maybe it went. where carl went. over the side.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{objection! speculation.}
<A>__{nels smiles his grandfather smile.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{your honor, all of this is speculation. including mr. hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{tht was summation, your h...}
<C>__{judge }
<D>__{overruled, alvin. let's hear this, hmmn?}
<A>__{nels gudmundsson nods to himself. takes a stroll over to the jury box. no limp today. something has put some spring in his step.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{so how does this fit with what you told us at the start? the freighter that plowed through ship channel bank...}
<A>__{and turns. leaning his scrawny butt against the jury's rail. he'll watch this with them now.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{that's when he fell.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{fell.}
<A>__{ishmael settles in. here we go.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{miyamoto gave him the battery, and left. carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing. but at some point, he thinks of the lantern...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{still lashed to the mast.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there. so he climbs up. to cut it down.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{just as the freighter comes through? isn't that quite a coincidence?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{coincidences happen. you run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere. split second tragedy happens every day. or maybe...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{maybe...?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{maybe carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working. same report milholland heard. and that makes him get the lantern fast. before the freighter's wake can bang it around.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{but you could be wrong. he could have climbed up earlier.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{then where's the lantern? and where's the knife?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{the knife. what knife?}
<A>__{as if he really has forgotten. as if he wants to know.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{coroner found an empty knife sheath on carl's belt. but they never found the knife.}
<A>__{he's nodding. yes, that's right.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{he climbs up. his hand wound still bleeding. that's the blood i found on the mast. and the twine.}
<A>__{nels' eyes are rapt. his mouth is shut. no way he interrupts this roll.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{he cuts the lantern free, the freighter's wake hits , the boat rolls hard , his bloody hand slips . tracing blood along the mast...}
<A>__{a hush.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{he falls. the lantern, the knife, go into the water. same as carl.}
<A>__{the words hang there.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{and inside the cabin, a coffee cup falls off the counter.}
<A>__{shakes his head.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{but there's no one around. to pick it up.}
<A>__{nels ponders. puts his hand to his chin.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{still a coincidence. timing and all.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{the freighter started through at 1:42. the sea water seeped into carl's watch and stopped it. at 1:47.}
