<A>__{arthur looks back into the hallway. there still stands cyrus's ghost. arthur slowly takes off his glasses. cyrus is still standing there.}

<D>__{you... son of a bitch...}
<A>__{cyrus realizes he's been made. arthur runs over and grabs his uncle, throwing him into the wall. arthur throws a punch, landing a hard right on cyrus.}

<P>__{(with every blow)}
<D>__{now. i. want. it. back!}
<A>__{but arthur has never been a warrior. cyrus, spotting his opportunity, retaliates. cyrus connects with arthur in the face, knocking him down. then he kicks arthur in the gut a few times, making sure he stays down.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{how dare you stand in the way of history, arthur! you are nothing, you hear me. nothing! i dedicated my entire life to this. every goddamn day. when have you ever shown that kind of dedication? huh? to anything?!}
