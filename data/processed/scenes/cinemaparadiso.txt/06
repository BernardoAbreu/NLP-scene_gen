<L>__{exterior cinema paradiso and various streets day}
<A>__{a grey, windy day. it is opening time and the shutters of the movie house are being rolled up. salvatore is about to enter through the small door of the spiral staircase, when in the distance he catches sight of... elena crossing a street with her books under her arm. she is alone. salvatore doesn't stop to think twice, dashes off, runs through streets full of dust, another square, turns the corner, but has lost sight of her. he looks around in all directions there she is! he starts running again. and finally catches up with her, all out of breath, practically speechless with emotion.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{hi, elena!}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{hi. why are you running?}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{no particular reason...}
<P>__{(he is entranced by her}
<D>__{eyes. he wants to tell her all sorts of things, say all the words he has memorized a thousand times. but now he can't get them out. his knees tremble. he does his best to overcome his confusion, but all that comes out}
<P>__{is:)}
<D>__{nice day, huh?}
<P>__{(a gust of wind envelops}
<D>__{them in a cloud of dust and a clap of thunder rends the air. elena laughs, amused by}
<P>__{the blunder.)}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{yes, nice day.}
<P>__{(salvatore laughs too. he}
<D>__{gazes at her long hair tossed by the wind. she}
<P>__{turns to leave.)}
<D>__{...i've got to go now. bye bye.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{bye bye, elena.}
<P>__{(elena walks away. and}
<D>__{salvatore also turns to leave. only now is he seized by disappointment, regret at not having made the best of the opportunity. he talks to}
<P>__{himself.)}
<D>__{...what an idiot! what an idiot! 'nice day'! christ!!}
