<L>__{interior bathroom}
<A>__{rosario closes the door on bobby, turns on the running water. then begins to rummage through her purse. finds a small vial of cocaine inside. takes it out, opens it, but drops it in the sink. the drug spills into the water, washing it down the drain. frantically, she tries to finger whatever residue is left on the porcelain...}
<L>__{interior foyer}
<A>__{entering the house: joseph and sandra, his wife. joe holds two bags one filled with cards and memorabilia, the other with clothes. what seems like a zillion people are here when he walks in. everyone cheers. burt moves right behind him, all smiles. joseph is thrilled but somehow not the same. his face doesn't look bad, but one eye is a different color from the other, and he's had reconstructive surgery on his jaw. there is, of course, a scar, and he's lost a lot of weight. behind him, burt waves everyone closer. jack and mike and other faces we can recognize from around the precinct stand back, all smiles. ad lib hellos. an elderly neighbor comes forward, giddy:}
<C>__{neighbor}
<D>__{wow, fella! you look great!}
<P>__{(pointing to his own eye)}
<D>__{your eye does it hurt?}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{only when i look at you!}
<A>__{laughter. then joseph freezes. he notices: bobby, next to the armed men who haven't left his side. the two brothers make eye contact. the crowd quiets a bit. bobby smiles at the sight of his brother. joseph gets emotional, too:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky }
<D>__{hey, bobby...}
<A>__{without a word, bobby nods, moves to his brother. as burt looks on, pleased, bobby takes his hand and grips the back of joseph's neck. joseph pulls his brother to him by his neck. a real embrace. joseph pats bobby's back.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{i'm real glad you're home...}
<A>__{the two separate, both smiling gently. breaking the moment:}
<C>__{sandra grusinsky}
<D>__{everyone, let's, let's move inside there's plenty to eat!}
<A>__{soft laughter. small talk begins. the group dissipates, moves to eat, etc. burt moves to joseph:}
<C>__{burt grusinsky}
<D>__{joseph we got some things we need to discuss, when you get the chance.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{we could do it now if you want, pop. in the den.}
<A>__{burt nods, reluctantly. all our men walk to the den except for bobby, who hears: rosario, down the hall. she approaches him.}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{bobby, i'm gonna go back to the motel.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{what're you talking about? they got a lot of food over there why don't you go eat something?}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{n i'm gonna go back.}
<A>__{a beat. bobby senses she's not completely right. looks into her eyes, then, more an accusation than a question:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{you fucked up?}
<A>__{a muttered "no" from rosario, hardly a committed denial. before he can say anything, from the den, burt peeks his head out:}
<C>__{burt grusinsky}
<D>__{bobby you should hear this too, for the trial.}
<A>__{burt motions for bobby to enter the den. back to rosario:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{we gotta straighten this out later.}
<A>__{bobby then moves to the den.}
