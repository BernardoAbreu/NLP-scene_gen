<A>__{teenagers of privilege and their uptight parents are milling around, dancing and chatting as a deejay spins tunes.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{i suppose the obvious answer is my eighteenth birthday...}
<A>__{mini dances with a few friends in a very short mini skirt and halter top. she clearly understands how to the drive the boys crazy and this is not lost on her mother, diane, 42, who stands off to the side, nursing a drink with some other hyper }
<B>__{aerobicized mothers.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{see, i was blessed with a terrific mom. not only is she a lush, but she also hates me.}
<A>__{diane is beautiful, but there is an essential hardness to her that comes from a life spent trading on her looks. the blouse and mini skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing for the occasion of her daughter's birthday.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{a few days before the party, i overhear her on the phone ordering me a male stripper. nothing says "i love you" like ten inches of man meat in your face.}
<A>__{diane and the other mothers are talking about mini's dancing.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{and knowing dear old ma, she'll try and nail him after the party...in my bed.}
<A>__{mini's friend kayla, a little rounder, but also brash, comes dancing over. she's swaying her hips provocatively at mini, almost challenging her. mike rudell, a tanned and trim man of 55, watches their display, clearly enjoying the way it's jump starting his imagination.}

<D>__{that guy? our neighbor mike rudell, big shot tv producer and the guy my mom screws whenever the batteries run out.}
<A>__{kayla and mini begin dancing together in a very explicit way, clearly trying to make the adults uncomfortable.}

<D>__{yo, bee ach!}
<C>__{kayla}
<D>__{yo, birthday bee ach!}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{is it on?}
