<L>__{interior laura's car night}
<A>__{they move down the street, and it's a little tense. laura pushes a tape into the stereo. art garfunkel's "bright eyes" begins to play. rob turns away from her and makes a face, but she knows he's making it.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you can make all the faces you want. my car. my car stereo. my compilation tape.}
<A>__{rob tries not to speak, but }
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{how can you like art garfunkel and marvin gaye? it's like saying you support the israelis and the palestinians.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{it's not like saying that at all, actually, rob. art garfunkel and marvin gaye make pop records }
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{ made. made. marvin gaye is dead, his father shot him in }
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{ whatever, and the israelis and the palestinians don't. art garfunkel and marvin gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the israelis and the palestinians are. art garfunkel and marvin gaye }
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{ alright, alright but }
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{ and who says i like marvin gaye, anyway?}
<A>__{he reels on her.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{hey! marvin gaye! "got to give it up!" that's our song! marvin gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{is that right? i'd like a word with him.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{but don't you remember?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i remember the song. i just couldn't remember who sang it.}
<A>__{rob shakes his head in disbelief.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i can see why you prefer gaye to garfunkel. i get it, really. but there are so many other things to worry about. they're only records, and if one is better than the other, well, who cares, besides you and barry and dick? i mean really, who gives a flying fuck?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you used to care more about things like marvin gaye than you do now. when i first met you, and i made you that tape, you loved it. you said and i quote "it was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{well, i liked you. you were a deejay, and i thought you were hot, and i didn't have a boyfriend, and i wanted one.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{so you weren't interested in music at all?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{yeah, sure. more so then than i am now. that's life though, isn't it?}
<A>__{the car slows, and laura parks.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{but laura... that's me. that's all there is to me. there isn't anything else. if you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you really believe that?}
<A>__{laura turns the engine off and unbuckles her seat belt.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yes. look at me. look at our the apartment. what else do i have, other than records and cds?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{and do you like it that way?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{not really.}
<A>__{she half smiles.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{let's go in.}
<A>__{she gets out of the car. rob turns to camera, speaking quietly and urgently.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{okay, number two: the stuff i told her about being unhappy in the relationship, about half looking around for someone else: she tricked me into saying it. we were having this state of the union type conversation and she said, quite matter of factly, that we were pretty unhappy at the moment, and did i agree, and i said yes, and she asked whether i ever thought about meeting someone else. so i asked her if she ever thought about it, and she said of course, so i admitted that i daydream about it from time to time. now i see that what we were really talking about was her and ian, and she suckered me into absolving her. it was a sneaky lawyer's trick, and i fell for it, because she's much smarter than me.}
<A>__{he scrambles out of the car.}
