<T>__{slam cut to:}
<L>__{exterior mountain high night}
<A>__{sven races, top speed, up a narrow cliff, pulling the sled, which skids precariously. kristoff mans the reins. anna sits beside him.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<P>__{(trying to scare anna)}
<D>__{hang on! we like to go fast!}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(fearless)}
<D>__{i like fast!}
<A>__{anna leans back and puts her feet up on the dashboard.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{whoa, whoa! get your feet down.}
<A>__{he pushes her feet down.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{this is fresh lacquer. seriously, were you raised in a barn?}
<A>__{kristoff spits on the dash to clean it. the spit flies back and hits anna in the face.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(grossed out)}
<D>__{ew. no, i was raised in a castle.}
<A>__{she wipes off her face.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{so tell me, what made the queen go all ice crazy?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{...oh well, it was all my fault. i got engaged but then she freaked out because i'd only just met him, you know, that day. and she said she wouldn't bless the marriage }
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{wait. you got engaged to someone you just met?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yeah. anyway, i got mad and so she got mad and then she tried to walk away, and i grabbed her glove }
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{hang on. you mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met?!}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes. pay attention. but the thing is she wore the gloves all the time, so i just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?}
<A>__{anna eyes kristoff up and down, then slides away from him.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes, they did.... but hans is not a stranger.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{oh yeah? what's his last name?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{...of the southern isles?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{what's his favorite food?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{...sandwiches.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{best friend's name?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{probably john.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{eye color.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{dreamy.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{foot size...?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{foot size doesn't matter.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{have you had a meal with him yet? what if you hate the way he eats? what if you hate the way he picks his nose?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{picks his nose?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{and eats it.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{excuse me, sir. he's a prince.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{all men do it.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ew. look it doesn't matter; it's true love.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{doesn't sound like true love.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{are you some sort of love expert?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{no. but i have friends who are.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you have friends who are love experts.... i'm not buying it.}
<A>__{sven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<P>__{(to anna)}
<D>__{stop talking.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, no, no. i'd like to meet these }
<A>__{kristoff clamps his hand over anna's mouth.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{i mean it. shhh.}
<A>__{kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them. sensing something behind them, he holds up his lantern. its light reflects off...eyes. several.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{sven, go. go!}
<A>__{sven takes off.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what are they?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{wolves.}
<A>__{flashes of white dart through the woods. kristoff hops into the back of the sled, grabs a torch. lights it.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{wolves. what do we do?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{i've got this. you just...don't fall off and don't get eaten.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{but i wanna help.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{because i don't trust your judgement.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{excuse me?!}
<A>__{a wolf jumps at them, but kristoff kicks it off.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{who marries a man she just met?}
<A>__{anna grabs the lute, swings it right at kristoff's head.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's true love!}
<A>__{he screams, as she...bam!...swings past kristoff and knocks a wolf away.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{whoa.}
<A>__{just then kristoff is yanked off the sled by another wolf. the torch goes flying. anna catches it, shocked.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{christopher!}
<A>__{kristoff grabs onto a loose rope hanging from the back of the sled and holds on for dear life as he's dragged behind.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{it's kristoff!}
<A>__{a wolf jumps on kristoff's back.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{ah!}
<A>__{anna thinks fast, uses the torch to light a blanket on fire.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{duck!}
<A>__{anna throws the flaming blanket right at him. he ducks. the blanket hits the wolves. they tumble off kristoff.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{you almost set me on fire!}
<A>__{anna reaches out a hand, pulls kristoff back onto the sled.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{but i didn't.}
<A>__{sven cries out. there is a massive gorge ahead.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{get ready to jump, sven!}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{you don't tell him what to do!}
<A>__{kristoff shoves a satchel into her arms then scoops her up.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{i do!}
<A>__{kristoff tosses anna onto sven, then unhooks sven's harness from the sled.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{jump, sven!}
<A>__{sven jumps the gorge with anna on his back. kristoff goes flying off behind them, still on the sled. anna and sven land safely on the other side of the gorge. kristoff's sled loses momentum. it's not going to make it. he leaps off. he flaps his arms, claws at the air. he slams into the snowy edge of the cliff. hanging by his hands, he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below and burst into flames.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<P>__{(shocked sadness)}
<D>__{...but i just paid it off.}
<A>__{suddenly, he starts to slip. he claws at the loose snow, but it's clearly hopeless. he's going down.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{uh oh. no, no, no.}
<A>__{to make matters worse, an axe comes flying right at his face.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{ah! no, no, no!}
<A>__{the axe slams into the snow, inches from his nose.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{grab on!}
<A>__{kristoff grabs on.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{pull, sven! pull!}
<A>__{reveal: the axe is tied to a rope, then wrapped around sven. anna helps sven pull kristoff to safety. kristoff rolls onto his back, exhausted. anna peeks down at the burning sled.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{whoa.... i will replace your sled and everything in it.}
<A>__{kristoff groans.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{and i understand if you don't want to help me anymore.}
<A>__{anna walks off, sadly. sven comes over and nuzzles kristoff.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{of course i don't want to help her anymore. in fact, this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again. kristoff (as sven) (cont'd) but she'll die on her own. kristoff (as self) (cont'd) i can live with that.}
<A>__{through their conversation, they watch anna go the wrong way...turn, go the other wrong way, turn, trip...}
<D>__{kristoff (as sven) (cont'd) but you won't get your new sled if she's dead.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<P>__{(knowing he's got a point)}
<D>__{...you know sometimes i really don't like you.}
<A>__{sven licks kristoff happily.}
<D>__{kristoff (as self) (cont'd)}
<P>__{(to anna)}
<D>__{hold up. we're coming?!}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{you are?!}
<P>__{(catching herself)}
<D>__{i mean, sure. i will let you tag along.}
