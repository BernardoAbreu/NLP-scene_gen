<L>__{89. exterior the desert. day.}
<A>__{by the time almasy emerges from the car, the sand pouring into the cabin, madox's car is roaring along the horizon. almasy waves, shouts, and then runs back into the car, finds his flare gun, and sends a flare high into the sky. katharine is with him now, and they watch, helplessly, as the car bounces away from them, madox a man on a mission. katharine panics, the sand has erased all traces of them. she speaks quietly, shocked.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{our tracks, where are they?}
<A>__{almasy is preoccupied. he's gone back to their vehicle and returns with a shovel, starts to dig frantically.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.}
<C>__{katharine}
<P>__{(realizing what he's doing)}
<D>__{oh my god, the others!}
<A>__{she kneels with him and helps to shovel away the sand which has completely engulfed the other vehicle containing the three bedouin.}
<C>__{almasy}
<P>__{(during this)}
<D>__{could i ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book? i should like to have them. i should be honored.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{of course. is it, am i a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?}
<C>__{almasy}
<P>__{(shoveling hard)}
<D>__{water? yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. not at all cowardly, extremely practical.}
<P>__{(anxious at not uncovering}
<A>__{the boys, egging himself on)}
<D>__{come on, come on!}
<P>__{(then back to katharine)}
<D>__{there's also a plant i've never seen it but i'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{find that plant. cut out its heart.}
<A>__{they hear noises, scrabbling, faint thumps. almasy scrapes at the sand and they find the glass of the car. the angle of the cab, tilted up to the sky, has made it impossible for the trapped boys to lever it open. their oxygen is rapidly deteriorating. almasy pulls the door and it cranks open.}
