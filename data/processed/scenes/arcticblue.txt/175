<A>__{eric stirs a pot of beans on the cookstove. corbett watches from the cot in the cell.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{talk to that good looking girl of yours?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you broke the radio, remember?}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i'm sure she's fine. seemed like a clever kid.}
<A>__{corbett sits up as eric hands him a plate of beans.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you were real resourceful out there. got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter. so he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones. gets along better than ever. yeah, maybe i underestimated you.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i liked you better frozen. you didn't talk so much.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{you're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good. you saw wonders you'd only dreamed of. that alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them.}
<A>__{corbett sees he's hit a nerve with eric.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{remember that demon in the gut? sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you. that's what you want out of this, isn't it?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{all i want want is you in jail }
<A>__{a knock at the door interrupts. eric lowers the flame on the gas lantern and peers out through a corner of the cardboard in the front window. frowning, he cracks the door open and slips outside.}
