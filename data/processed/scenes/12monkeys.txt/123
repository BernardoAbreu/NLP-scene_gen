<D>__{i'm afraid this doesn't seem very professional to me, in fact it's distressingly unprofessional for some one who treated my son briefly (if indeed you actually are who you say you are) to take a sudden unsolicited interest in his mental health six years later, and to telephone a parent to express opinions that would be inappropriate...}
