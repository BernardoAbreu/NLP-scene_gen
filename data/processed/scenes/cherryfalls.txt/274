<L>__{interior party house}
<A>__{kenny and jody limp through the front door. couples are everywhere. there's no room to even walk. the party has reached it's 'climax'. we see the faces of teenage boys and girls as they lose their virginity. they run the gamut of emotions. some are terrified, some are ecstatic. some are concentrating as hard as they've ever concentrated, some are closing their eyes, trying to fade out. we see sandy, mark, cindy, and ben all having a blast. sharon has managed to find a new partner and the nerds are riding the homely girls. it's orgiastic. kenny and jody can only marvel at it as they limp through the maze of bodies looking for a place to hide. kenny grabs a sheet off the ground and carries jody up the stairs.}
