<D>__{...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{you know, i don't know if i could do this even if i wanted to. the gaming commission would never give me a license. i have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.}
<C>__{stone}
<D>__{you don't have to have a license to work in a casino. all you gotta do is apply for one. the state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. they got a ten year backlog.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{but what happens when they do find out?}
<C>__{stone}
<D>__{why would they want to find out? we're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. why would they want to lock us out? and besides, they'll never find out. all you gotta do is keep changing your job title. like, uh, from casino executive to food and beverage chairman. and what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. i know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.}

<D>__{it's a tough proposition, andy. you, you know, if i did it, i'd have to run it my way.}

<D>__{you got it.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{i'm serious. no interference.}
<C>__{stone}
<D>__{nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. i guarantee it.}
