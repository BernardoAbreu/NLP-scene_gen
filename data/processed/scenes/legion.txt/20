<L>__{interior paradise falls gas `n' grub same}
<A>__{bob reenters the diner to find kyle sitting at the counter, digging into a plate of banana pancakes. kyle is about to address him again, when something else steals bob's attention.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(holding up a silencing hand)}
<D>__{yeah, wait a minute.}
<A>__{the tv has gone on the fritz again. only now the image is mostly snow. bob climbs back onto the chair. faces the tv.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what's wrong with you today?}
<A>__{whack! the image flickers but doesn't improve.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{i told you to get the satellite tv. but you don't wanna listen.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what the hell do i need that crap for?}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{history channel, man!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i got all the history i can take.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's for sure.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what's your problem now?}
<A>__{whack!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{where do i start?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you know this was the top of the line model when i bought it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah, in the fifties.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you shouldn't be watchin' anyways.}
<P>__{(rubs his hands together)}
<D>__{okay, baby, this is gonna do it.}
<A>__{bob gives the tv one final wallop whack! and the picture snaps into focus. only it isn't the picture he was expecting. the stark graphic of the emergency broadcasting system and its accompanying hollow tone fill the diner. everybody in the place stops and turns to the tv.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{see? clear as day.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{nice work, bob. what the hell's that?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{it's just one of those test things.}
<A>__{that'd be true, except for the words at the bottom of the screen, which read: "this is not a test" bob switches the channels. all the same.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{don't look like a test.}
<A>__{bob steps off the chair and backs slowly away from the tv as if a little distance will bring some clarity. he bumps into kyle.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{yo, am i the invisible motherfuckin' man here? do you have a phone or not?}
<A>__{kyle peels a five dollar bill off a serious wad of cash. that gets bob's attention. bob snaps the money out of his hand.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{in the back past the kitchen. make it fast.}
<A>__{kyle hustles passed percy. charlie is standing by the anderson's table, clearing dishes. everybody's eyes are locked on the tv.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{if there's a real emergency aren't they supposed to give us some information about what to do?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{i'm sure it's a mistake.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{hey, percy, give that old radio of yours a shot. maybe they got some news about the tv.}
<A>__{percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen shelf. switches it on. static. he spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal. the same hollow tone of emergency broadcasting. station after station the same thing. the diner is overwhelmed by a chilling chorus of hollow tones. everyone goes very still.}
<C>__{kyle }
<D>__{let me talk to him...}
