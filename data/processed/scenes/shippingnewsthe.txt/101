<L>__{exterior jack buggit's house night}
<A>__{the road is jammed with parked cars and trucks and vans and wagons folks still streaming toward the brightly lit house. ever'body knows ever'body.}
<L>__{interior jack's house night}
<A>__{every room is filled with folks who wear their best. there is eating and chatter and even some pockets of laughter, as we move through the crowd. as if some have taken hold of a wake's well meaning purpose. others stand dazed, still wearing their pain and confusion. there are children here, some hold a parent's hand, some giggle with each other. snapshot of a community. struggling to cope. quoyle and bunny enter, holding hands, looking around. as they cross the room... ...two figures step into their path. two women holding hands, their bodies close together. their feeling for each other open for all to see. one is agnis. and the other. isn't mavis bangs.}
<C>__{dawn}
<D>__{happy new year, mr. quoyle. i'm sorry i missed you at the pageant.}
<A>__{slightly startled, quoyle can't help but smile, despite the solemn occasion. at the proud look on his aunt's face.}
<C>__{dawn}
<D>__{i was in the wings, a course. wasn't our girl somethin'?}
<A>__{our girl, a course, is agnis. who nearly blushes at the compliment.}
<C>__{dawn}
<D>__{i say, y'have t'love a woman. who's in touch with her inner chicken.}
<A>__{well, who could argue with that. dawn leans up, kisses quoyle on the cheek. and with surprising softness...}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{nephew. you okay?}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{he's okay. he's not sleeping in the box.}
<A>__{her great aunt looks at this child. bends to plant an unexpected kiss on the top of bunny's head. the kid squirms, tugs her dad firmly off, as he sends a parting wave. into the parlor now. quieter here, as the new arrivals thread past jack buggit in his open coffin, resting on black draped sawhorses. dennis and his mom stand by jack, a hand and a word for each. and moving into the line...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{remember what i told you.}
<A>__{his words a murmur. hers are bolder...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{if he's not sleeping. why do they call it a awake?}
<A>__{he thinks. as if it is a worthwhile question.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{we're the ones have to be awake. to how much we love him...}
<A>__{nods to himself. yes.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{and how we should be good to each other. while we have the chance.}
<A>__{he looks down. they are almost there.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you think?}
<A>__{she is thinking. keeping the thoughts to herself. at the coffin now, he lifts her up to see. jack lies motionless, a wax figure of himself. serene behind violet eyelids.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{he looks like he's sleeping.}
<A>__{dennis looks over. his stolid, grim face releases a smile for his friend.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{that's cos he's peaceful. no worries, anymore. no troubles.}
<A>__{he sets her down. clasps mrs. buggit's hand. and from his pocket...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{i found this in jack's drawer at the paper. i don't know if it's somethin' special...}
<A>__{an enameled wreath with the initial r, backed by a long, sharp pin she tears up again, just to see it.}
<C>__{mrs. buggit}
<D>__{oh, it's his lodge pin. we were lookin' all over.}
<A>__{she smiles bravely as she takes it. leans up to kiss his cheek.}
<C>__{mrs. buggit }
<D>__{dennis showed me what y'wrote fer th' paper. did jack proud.}
<A>__{so they look at each other. dennis clears his throat, looks away. and then, quoyle is leading bunny off.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you hungry? there's sandwi...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{petal's peaceful, too.}
<A>__{just a statement of fact. to no one in particular. dad squeezes her hand. manages...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you bet. you can count on tha...}
<A>__{but she lets go. scampers to a corner of the room. to herry prowse. and his mom. so quoyle starts toward her, his heart in his throat. and when wavey looks up. she is glad to see him. as he reaches her... she holds up her wrist. dangling from it, her turquoise bracelet she wore her best for jack. quoyle stands very close. one last thing from his pocket...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{new year's present.}
<A>__{a small box. wrapped as careful as he could. she looks to his eyes, really?}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{oh, yeh. it's a quoyle tradition.}
<A>__{well, in that case. she takes it into her slender fingers. undoes the ribbon, the paper. lifts the lid to see, resting in tissue... ...eggshells. crushed almost to powder. her heart comes straight to her eyes, even before the whispered...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{thanks. for the mirror.}
<A>__{and across the room, mrs. buggit leans with trembling hands to fix the lodge pin to jack's lapel. shaking as she is, the hand lurches, the big pin goes plunging, and... ...a rattling cough. rolls across this room. the world falls silent. jack's wife grabs her son's arm, and their eyes bug out, staring into the box.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{dad's come back!}
<A>__{and lunges to help hs gurgling father free his shoulders from the coffin's wedge. a sudden roar, there are screams, there is even laughter and whistling, complete chaos. and in the bedlam, a tug on quoyle's coat...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{see. he woke up.}
