<A>__{as they come to a plot of ground, they stop. there are two matching headstones, one for jack's father, fully engraved, and another for jack's mother, bearing only her name. jack studies the plot a moment, then crouches before his father's marker: "andrew s. baker. adoring husband of eleanor, loving father of franklin and john." jack brushes some dirt from the face of the stone, then stands.}
