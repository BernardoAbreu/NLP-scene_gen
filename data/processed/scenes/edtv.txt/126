<L>__{3) hockey arena}
<A>__{close up of ed, driving the zamboni. he's loving it. he waves to shari. shari in the stands, watching. she waves and smiles. the ice, a wider shot. the zamboni is, basically out of control. carlos is sliding along the ice, shooting ed as the zamboni zig zags dangerously, eventually crashing into the boards, shattering the plexiglas.}
<L>__{interior local rock club night}
<A>__{it's very crowded. claustrophobic. loud. ed and shari enter just to see the show. they're spotted. the crowd, which is already fired up by the music, sees them. it starts out okay, people crowding around, patting ed on the back. a chant begins "ed, ed, ed..." pretty soon it drowns out the music. more people press towards ed. it's too crowded dangerous. shari is swept away from ed. she's buffeted about, violently. she goes down. ed can't move. the crowd is friendly and happy, but the effect is scary.}
