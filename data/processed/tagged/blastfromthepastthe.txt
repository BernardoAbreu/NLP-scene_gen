<A>__{the pilot feels the jet shake. but he looks at his indicators and everything appears to be normal. he relaxes.}

(we can hear military air traffic chatter on calvin's hallicrafter radio.) then move down to the window where we see calvin webber tinkering with a gadget at his work bench. calvin's very pregnant wife helen appears. the music becomes source.}

<A>__{the women look at calvin. angle calvin with guests (one is called harold) at the bar.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{there currently exists a type of neon light that lasts five years. but you won't see it on the market. same is true of batteries. i could take your simple yacht battery and rig it to last a decade, easily.}

<D>__{well, what the heck kind of a marketing system can't get great new products like that out to the public?}
<C>__{calvin}
<P>__{(intense)}

<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, i think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. i'm sure this cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...i'd suggest taking a prayerful watch and wait stance!}

<D>__{we'll do this again! maybe next week. here's your hat. could i wrap something up for you? did you have a coat?}

<C>__{helen}
<D>__{well, i'm certainly not going to let the pot roast go to waste. could you just put that seat cover back on that lawn chair?}
<A>__{he does.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{shouldn't we at least turn off the phonograph?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{it shuts off automatically.}

<D>__{did you rig it to do that? you're so clever.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{no. they all do.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i never know anymore.}
<A>__{the sound of the trainer jet makes a low pass over calvin's house. calvin sticks his head out the door and looks up.}

<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{calvin unplugs the radio and quickly wraps the cord.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{we can listen to the rest downstairs!}
<A>__{he pushes aside a table that is hiding a hatch in the floor and unlocks it by turning the hatch's wheel. then he opens the hatch and reaches inside to turn on a light. red submarine light shines up from below. all the while he and helen are chatting:}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{calvin, i wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. it's not going to be that easy getting all that dried on food off my nice plates.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{cheese is particularly troublesome.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{worse than your kraft holiday dip?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh, much worse. but not as bad as that mexican jumping bean dip. you remember that?}
<C>__{calvin}

<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i don't know. for this thing to blow over, it could take days.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{days??}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{rather safe than sorry. that's my motto!}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{but, what if i go into labor? that could happen any time.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i've read up on it. i will deliver the baby myself if i have to.}

<D>__{now you listen to me calvin webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.}

<D>__{as long as we've got that straight.}
<L>__{exterior jet same time}

<P>__{(with arms spread)}
<D>__{home sweet home!}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{to you maybe.}
<A>__{calvin flicks a wall switch and we hear a series of lights coming on. the echoes of the sounds suggest a large, cavernous space. all we can see is the cinder block wall behind them and the hatch door, which calvin begins to shut by putting his body into it. just then there is a tremendous double explosion from above which knocks them to the floor. (note: helen hangs on to the roast, trying her best not to drop it.) the ladder, corrugated tube, roof, and lots or dirt and rock begin to crash down into the anteroom. calvin struggles to his feet and gets the vault door shut just in the nick of time.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what was that?!}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{are you all right?!}
<A>__{hanging on to the roast she nods vigorously, trying to be brave.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes, i think so.}
<A>__{calvin hurries to a bright red metal box on the wall. next to the box is a large thermometer or gauge that's labeled "radiation count." there are other gauges that are dropping to zero.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{oh, no! it's happened! look at that heat!! all my surface indicators are knocked out! oh, my lord...it's actually happened!!}
<L>__{inter cut :}

<A>__{the chrome and steel exit hatchway automatically locks with great noise, precision and...finality. there is the sound of a rear door doing the same thing.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what's that noise?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{the locks.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{the locks?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{to keep us from trying to leave. after an atomic blast there's a radiation half life that lasts thirty five years.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{thirty five years!}
<C>__{calvin}
