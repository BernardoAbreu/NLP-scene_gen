He said they had to operate to take out the whatdycallit, the placenta and now she's still bleeding. He said she'd lost a lot of blood before the ambulance came, and now they're trying to stop it, and he said a whole lot of things I didn't get, about capillaries, and he said she's unconscious.

<ACTION>__{Shep walks tentatively, holding a cup in each hand, slopping coffee onto the floor... He rounds the corner and stops. Frank is no longer in his chair at the end of the long echoing hallway. Shep looks around... Then suddenly, the double doors are flung open and a number of nurses hurry out. Behind them, comes Frank, supported by two Doctors. Shep runs to them as they move Frank over to a chair.    He's in shock.}
