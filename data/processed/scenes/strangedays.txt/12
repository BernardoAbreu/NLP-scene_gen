<A>__{pov of a woman writhing above us in ecstasy. lovemaking in point of view. we look down, see our body, a woman's body... our hands moving over the other woman's torso. the image is dark, a primal impression. sound of harsh breathing, rustling sheets. back to lenny in the booth with skinner. lenny has skinner's tape running in a playback deck clipped to his belt, next to his pager. he is hunched over the table, "sampling" the merchandise by touching a few of the trode pads to his temple without putting on the whole headset. like a coke dealer taking a little on the fingernail.}

<D>__{it was her first time, lenny. cut her some slack.}
<A>__{tight slowmo shots... abstract: squid tapes and money changing hands. a squid tape sliding sensuously into a deck. tight cu lenny, through the windshield of his car. neon moving over him. news footage: lapd aerospatiales circling, their xenon lights turning night into day, giving the impression of a futuristic war zone. inside the cockpit, the infrared camera shows green screen images of people in cars, in their homes... like footage of hyenas shot at night in total darkness. the impression is of a society under siege, an occupied nation... a watched society where the camera eye and the police spotlight define our reality.}
