<A>__{she applies some lipstick to her cheeks to give her some color. but she just looks odd. she ends up wiping it away with the back of her hand. gosh, this car in front is really taking its sweet time. she decides to overtake. she accelerates to sixty. as she passes the driver stares at her car. she slows down so as not to arouse any more suspicion. she passes the familiar sign for "pleasant valley drive". the road's empty ahead so she guns it to sixty five. the closer she gets to home, the faster she wants to go. she tries to resist but can't. the speedometer hits seventy. the car hurtles into the night. oh no, a red light ahead. and a car waiting to go in the opposite direction. she decides to slow for this one. barely makes it screeches to a halt. the driver in the forward facing car checks her out. she attempts to smile and look like a normal housewife.}
