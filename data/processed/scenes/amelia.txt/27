<L>__{interior hotel room early morning}
<A>__{amelia in her flight gear, sitting on the edge of her bed, an open telegram lies beside her. her elbows rest on her knees. her hands are locked together. her profile is stony, determined. tilt down to the telegram... it reads: weather permitting, mabel flies this afternoon. she grabs her flight bag, leaves the room. she only has to travel as far as the next door. pounds on it. waits. pounds louder with both fists. slim opens the door. looking bad. bill sits up in bed, groggy, disoriented.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{christ, what time is...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{time to fly. get up, get dressed, we're going now.}
<A>__{she is calm and angry at once. a powerful combination. slim pulls his pants off a chair.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{where's the weather report?}
<A>__{she goes to his bed. hands him a slip of paper. he blinks, still waking up. reads.}
<P>__{bill (cont’d)}
<D>__{it's not good enough.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{great. maybe mabel will think so, too. because if she doesn't, she's going to paris and you're going home. today.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it's not good enough.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{it's fine, there's a tail wind all the way, we'll off load to 700 gallons, which gets us off the water and the wind gets us to ireland.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{we've had better than this and we haven't gone.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{but this is the day mabel's ready, so we're going now. the weather is going to get better and we'll be there to enjoy it.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you're serious.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{just as serious as you're hung over.}
<P>__{(to slim)}
<D>__{you go now, get the late weather, we'll meet you at the plane.}
<A>__{go. now! slim pulls on his shoes, grabs his jacket, his bag. looks to bill, but the pilot is glaring at his commander.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d) (quiet)}
<D>__{slim, get out. i've got this.}
<A>__{a beat. slim goes, the door shuts quietly. amelia sits on the edge of bill's bed.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{i've loved one person unconditionally, bill. he is the most caring and generous and charming and flat out funny guy i will ever know. he's my father.}
<A>__{her eyes are burning with this. and bill keeps quiet. anyone would.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{he's a drunk. and he's let me down all my life.}
<A>__{she leans closer.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{now you get out of that bed. and you fly that god damned thing to ireland. or i swear to you, bill...}
<A>__{just above a whisper...}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{i swear to you i will. or die trying.}
<A>__{you got that? do you?}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{and either way. you're going to be living with it.}
