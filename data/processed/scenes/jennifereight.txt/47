<L>__{46: interior reception. institute. day.}
<A>__{a huge christmas poster advertises shasta trinity arts crafts. helena sits in the deserted foyer reading braille. the volume is the size of a phone directory. berlin appears via the main entrance. windswept and wasted and surprised she's still here.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. i couldn't get out.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{it was probably the wind.}
<A>__{hellava wind that turns a key! but he says nothing. takes the book while she gets into her coat. she's obviously made an ef fort. a change of clothes and her hair pinned up. but she has got the sweater on inside out and the label is under her chin.}

<A>__{by now they're at the doors with berlin escorting her through.}
<D>__{47: interior restaurant diner. trinity valley. day.}
<A>__{red brick walls and help yourself to salad. all but empty and their food is yet to arrive. berlin is clearly having a tough time with the conversation. basically because there isn't any.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{.. i will tell you what, if i prom ise to stop being a cop, will you promise to stop being a witness?}
<A>__{helena sits frozen like she's waiting for results of an x ray.}

<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i'm sorry .. i don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. i feel like everyone's looking at me ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{there's no one "looking at you" .. there's hardly anyone in here. the only person looking at you, is me.}
<A>__{and he likes what he's looking at. and maybe helena senses it.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{are you married?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{was. but i don't like to talk about it.}
<C>__{helena}
