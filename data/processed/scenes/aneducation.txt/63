<L>__{interior jenny's house. evening}
<A>__{graham, jenny and her father are at the dinner table, sitting in the dark. marjorie kicks the door open with her foot and comes in holding a birthday cake with seventeen candles burning on it. she puts it down carefully on the table.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{blow them out, then, before the whole place burns down. jenny closes her eyes, makes her wish, blows out her candles. her father and mother both look at her, apparently attempting to read her mind. jack gets up to turn the lights on. we can see that by jenny's side are two unopened, carefully wrapped presents, both exactly the same size clearly books.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{who'd like a piece? in truth, the cake is a rather sorry and unappetising specimen. there isn't enough icing on the top. she cuts a couple of slices which immediately collapse.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{never mind. i will have one of those.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{come on. presents. without any real enthusiasm, jenny opens the first one of the two, from her mum and dad. it's a latin dictionary.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oh. thank you. i needed a new one.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(crestfallen)}
<D>__{oh dear. the doorbell rings. jenny perks up. jack goes to answer it, and immediately the house is energised: it's david.}
