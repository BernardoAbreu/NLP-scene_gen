<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{he pushes the button repeatedly. then angrily slams the side of the machine. nothing.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you piece of shit.}
<A>__{as paul turns away, he notices a door with a sign on it: authorized personnel only. paul glances around. then quickly walks over to the door.}
<L>__{interior police station. garage moments later}
<A>__{a dozen wrecked cars. twisted metal. paul's footsteps echo through the empty garage. it's dark. out the corner of his eye paul glimpses a shape move quickly around a pillar. he stops. unsettled. just then we hear a woman's footsteps. her high heels clicking on the concrete floor. there's something strange about the sound. unnatural. paul listens nervously. the footsteps grow fainter. then fade away. the garage is silent again. too quiet. paul moves apprehensively over to anna's green toyota. the car's a mess. one side's completely caved in. he touches the car. pulls open the door. squeezes into the driver's seat. anna's car glass everywhere. paul glances at the kitschy bobblehead doll on the dashboard flecked with blood. he places his hands on the steering wheel. suddenly he hears a strange noise. he looks up... the kitschy doll. its head nodding slowly. its smiling face now unnaturally sinister. turning towards us until it abruptly stops. staring straight at us. paul looks at the doll transfixed. just then a pale woman's hand slowly reaches through the window... and touches paul's shoulder. he jumps. turns. anna stands by the car. staring blankly at him. the color drains from paul's face.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{paul?}
<A>__{the police captain, tom peterson, stands by the car where anna was a second ago. he pulls his hand away from paul's shoulder. looks at him with concern. paul gathers his composure. he must have just imagined anna was there. he shoves the door open. he's about to step out when he turns back and grabs the kitschy doll.}

<D>__{tom. you're my friend.}
<C>__{tom}
