<L>__{int waldman's house dining room night}
<A>__{victor, waldman, and henry are gathered around the remains of a meal, laughing uproariously, enjoying one another's company. cigars are lit, wine is flowing. conversation is fast and loose, intense and passionate:}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{i'm quite serious. look at all the charity and clinic work we do. up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{i'm convinced. not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously guarded secrets.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(turning serious)}
<D>__{do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{no. but someday.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{thank goodness. we'd be out of work.}
<A>__{a howl of outrage and laughter. victor flings his napkin in henry's face.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{only you would think of that!}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{somebody has to!}
<A>__{victor raises his wine glass. the others join. a toast.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i tell you what we need, my friends. forget the symptoms and diseases. what we need is a vaccine for death itself.}
<C>__{waldman}
<P>__{(laughter)}
<D>__{oh, now you have gone too far. there's only one god, victor.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(raises his glass)}
<D>__{and here's to him. everything in moderation, frankenstein.}
<C>__{victor}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{nothing in moderation, clerval.}
