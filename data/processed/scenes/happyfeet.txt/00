<A>__{the ice itself is moaning and groaning, like a living thing. a single crack appears and widens, then forks and forks again. the whole expanse of fast ice is disintegrating, starting at the sea ice and progressing towards the ice cliffs. somewhere an iceberg breaks free from the face of a glacier and smashes down into the frozen sea below. at the same time...}

<A>__{mumble places the pebble on the pile. a long pause}
<C>__{loveday}
<D>__{a little nervous? that's normal. take your time.}
<A>__{in fact mumble is mesmerised by the luight catching loveday's six pack holder. he bends forwards to study it more closely}
<C>__{mumble}

<D>__{so these mystic beings, did you see them?}
<C>__{loveday}
<D>__{i hear them. they talk to me all the time i am their instrument. they chose me to......}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{did they have frontways eyes? no feathers? fat flabby faces? did they probe you and stick a pointy thing into you?}
<C>__{loveday}
<D>__{enough! how many questions is that? you don't have enough pebbles.}

<A>__{curious, ella turns. framed between the adelies, mumble strikes a pose, holds it for a moment... then lets rip. he tap dances...uninhibited, wild, joyous. the adelies accompany him. they know all the moves and it is infectious feet are beginning to tap, couples are beginning to improvise... singing along, trying out the dance steps. now ella is caught up in it. and mumble is dancing like no penguin has ever done before!}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{this is it ella! this is the song inside me!}

<D>__{i'm just showing them happy feet}

<C>__{an elder}
<D>__{...then what did?!}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{my own opinion? i think living beyond the ice there are creatures we've never met before aliens. mystic beings. big, flabby......}

<D>__{its the only way. you're right. unless we have food theres no future for any of us you, me the adelies, anyone}

<A>__{mumble kicks a bunch of pebbles at him.}
<C>__{mumble}

<A>__{loveday then he makes a strange "oi, oi, oi" sound.}

<C>__{loveday}
<D>__{oi}
<B>__{a mountain ridge}

<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{hear that?!}
<A>__{as they crest the peak, sure enough, down below: the land of the elephant seals. thousands of them.}
<C>__{the adelies}

<C>__{elephant seal 2}
<D>__{mystic who?}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{aliens, the ones who made this.}

<C>__{elephant seal 1}
<D>__{could be!? i heard they'd take a whole penguin, rip its skin right off and turn it into mush.}
<C>__{elephant seal 2}
<D>__{huh! that's a picnic! i hear tell they'd take a baby seal and club it to death. with their bare clubs.}
<C>__{elephant seal 1}

<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{i said a circle!}

<C>__{an adelie}
<D>__{...no, no. this can't be right! ...it was better the other way.}

<C>__{the adelies }
<D>__{...just keep moving or you'll get my beak up your butt}
<B>__{flare out to white}
<A>__{the blizzard has passed. an eerie stillness. one by one the adelies get to their feet and waddle forwards to where mumble and loveday stand, gazing into the distance. they have finally reached the sea again}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{you think this is it? the forbidden shore?}
<A>__{loveday chokes out a `yes'.}
<C>__{adelies}
<D>__{....the way i feel": the "frostbitten" shore ....so what are those black things?.}
<A>__{close to the waters edge, the outline of several buildings}
<B>__{an abandoned whaling station}
<A>__{the penguins venture through it, dwarfed by the old flensing sheds, the chimneys and boiling vats. its all now abandoned, and half concealed by snow. around and above them, there are hooks, chains, rusting twisted metalwork.}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{hello?! is there anyone out there?}
<A>__{an ominous groaning as some rusting metal plate moves in the wind.}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{hello!!}
<C>__{the adelies}
<D>__{...no need to shout. ...yeah, somebody might hear you. ...i think we seen all there is to see round here.}
<A>__{loveday is looking at something at his feet.}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{there, imbedded in the ice: another six pack holder.}
<B>__{the sea ice}
<A>__{mumble and the adelies venture out onto the weak ice beyond the whaling station, finding more and more of the strange artefacts: a piece of nylon rope, a soda can, a boot.}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{they must be here somewhere. they wouldn't leave all this stuff lying around.}
<C>__{an adelie}
<D>__{maybe they invisible.}
<B>__{further on}
<A>__{they've reached the edge of the sea ice. loveday croaks a warning. he points out to sea.}
<C>__{an adelie}
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{a wave has appeared on the glassy surface of the sea. it is coming towards them, fast like the bow wave of an immense}
<B>__{underwater creature.}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{a whale?}
<C>__{an adelie}
<D>__{as long as it's a good whale, not the other kind.}
<A>__{the wave is coming closer.}
<C>__{another adelie}
<D>__{what other kind?!!}
<A>__{a massive black dorsal fin breaks the surface.}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{the ones with teeth!!}
<A>__{the penguins are off and running... the dorsal fin keeps coming like the blade of a demonic carving knife. then the monstrous fin disappears and kaboom! the killer whale breaches the ice ahead of them, cutting off their retreat. they are left stranded on a free floating ice floe}
<C>__{the adelies}
<D>__{...jump! ...swim for it!}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{no!! stay on the ice pad where its safe}
<A>__{the little floe is wobbling crazily}
<C>__{the adelies}
<D>__{...you call this safe amigo? ...maybe we should split up. ...you split up i'm staying right here.}
<A>__{the killer whale breaches again, rising like a tower block out of the ocean.}
<C>__{the adelies }
<D>__{woooaaaahhh!!}
<A>__{the ice pad flips, flinging them into the water like a handful of peanuts.}
<B>__{in the sea}
<A>__{the penguins head for shore , swimming for their lives. loveday, thrashing and wheezing, is unable to keep up.}
<C>__{mumble}
<P>__{(stops)}
<D>__{loveday! loveday!!}
<A>__{he swims back. the killer whale is about to take them both in one bite. mumble pulls loveday aside, but he's not quite quick enough: one of the whale's outer teeth catches loveday by the six pack plastic and he is dragged away, tethered to the killer whale like captain ahab. the whale thrashes around wildly trying to dislodge the hapless little penguin until... loveday is flung high, high into the air and...splashes down some distance away. the killer whale is left with the six pack plastic lodged in its teeth.}
<B>__{ice shelf}
<A>__{mumble and loveday scramble onto the ice exhausted. wondering where the next attack will come from, the amigos huddle nearby. suddenly the ice shelf cracks open and the killer whale soars right over the top of them it hits the water but does not stop, just keeps going right on out to sea. the penguins have no time to reflect on their good fortune. theres an earth shattering noise behind them . turning they see a vast black shape, a hundred feet high, coming at them through the fog. the adelies flee across the ice. mumble stands transfixed by the big black ship towering above him. on the deck he sees}
<B>__{human figures...}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{aliens?!}
<A>__{the pack ice is buckling and exploding ahead of the great}
<B>__{juggernaut.}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{stop! please!....}
<A>__{from a safe distance the adelies stop and look on in amazement as mumble stands his ground, shouting up at the ship as it advances towards him.}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{...it's very important!}
<A>__{the ice beneath his feet opens up, mumble topples into the gap and the ship passes over him, huge propellers churning, leaving a channel ninety feet wide. mumble resurfaces.}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{we...have...to...talk!}
<A>__{he chases after the ship. the adelies chase after mumble...}
<C>__{the adelies}
<D>__{...amigo o o o! ...let it go o o o o!!}
<A>__{already the ship is half a mile away.}
<B>__{the iceberg}
<A>__{beyond the last of the ice floes is the world's tallest iceberg. mumble hurls himself onto it and starts scrambling up its precipitous sides. the adelies follow, struggling to keep up.}

<A>__{mumble's pov: the big black ship has joined two others about a mile away. the adelies join him.}
<C>__{the adelies}
<D>__{...you found them, you found aliens! ...now we go back tell everybody who's taking the fish.}
<A>__{mumble's eyes remain fixed on the horizon.}
<C>__{the adelies }
<D>__{...don't feel bad tall guy. ...they were just too fast. too big. ...too everything.}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{they've stopped!}
<C>__{loveday}
<D>__{mumble. i owe you my life amigo. and i say this because i admire and deeply respect you. if you are thinking what i think you are thinking. you are out of your crazy head}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{say hi to ella for me}
<C>__{adelies}
<D>__{you say hi. come back and say hi to her yourself}

<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{oh. one other thing. you guys}
<C>__{adelies}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{suddenly, mumble turns to the precipice and runs as fast as he can...}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{excelsi yah!!!}
<A>__{as he launches himself into space...}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{the tiny penguin soaring off the top of the iceberg. the adelies rush to the edge as, far below mumble hits the water. and vanishes.}
<C>__{the adelies}
<D>__{...can you believe that ...brought us all this way and killed himself ...no he didn't! look!}
<A>__{far out he has surfaced and is swimming strongly in direction of the big black ship.}
<C>__{the adelies }
<D>__{...a dive like that, and still he lives! ... yeah like when he did his happy feet, his feet had wings. ...a normal penguin could never have done it.}
<C>__{loveday}
<D>__{you don't think we should go with him}
<C>__{adelies}
<D>__{...don't sweat it revered one. many are called, few are chosen.}
<C>__{adelies }
<D>__{..hey, how tall you think the tall guy was? ...who could say? four times my height at least...}
<A>__{loveday follows behind}
<C>__{loveday}
<D>__{about this revered one stuff, you guys}
<C>__{an adelie}
<D>__{yeah}
<C>__{loveday}
<D>__{maybe just call me pedro}
<B>__{the open sea}
<A>__{mumble ploughs through a rolling sea: towering waves block everything from view but on the crests he catches sight of... three black ships, far ahead, but stationary, as if waiting for him.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{he's getting closer. the ships are only half a mile away when something rises from the deep, threatening to engulf him: a huge net, teeming with fish. mumble shoots out of the way, just avoiding being caught as. up ahead the great net full of fish breaks the surface of the water and is winched on board.}
<C>__{mumble}
<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{hey! you can't do that! what about us?! the scarcity! the scarcity!!}
<A>__{as if in response the ship's engines start up again and the sea around him erupts in churning foam. swamped by the wake, mumble goes under. when he resurfaces, the ship is already on its way.}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{hey you think you're gonna get away with this?!! not if i can help it you shit squirter alien creeps.}
<A>__{he takes a deep breath and resumes his pursuit.}
<B>__{open ocean}
<A>__{the seas are mountainous. there is no sign of the ship now, nor of land. mumble swims up the side of each wave, over its foaming crest and down into the deep dark valley below.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{the air is full of spray. choking, mumble ducks under the water.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{its peaceful here. then something moves beside him and turns with a start to see: a massive eye!! a blue whale entirely fills his field of vision. it sings a few booming wagnerian notes. its voice is almost deafening.}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{too loud.}
<A>__{he surfaces, spluttering.}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{too loud!}
<A>__{a voice calls to him from above. mumble looks up. an albatross hovers overhead.}
<C>__{albatross}
<D>__{he's looking for a mate, mate. and these days, i tell you they're few and far between}
<A>__{from the albatross' aerial view, mumble looks tiny next to the massive bulk of the blue whale.}
<C>__{albatross }
<D>__{talking of which, i never seen a penguin this far out. watch you don't hit the convergence mate.}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{the convergence?}
<C>__{albatross}
<D>__{where the cold water meets the warm, mate. once you cross it, there's no getting' back. what you tryinmg to prove anyway?}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{i'm trying to talk to the aliens!}
<C>__{albatross}
<D>__{the who?}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{on the black iceberg. the ones taking all the fish!}
<C>__{albatross}
<D>__{them. fish is just the start of it mate. them aliens is the ones who took out the whales.}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{they kill whales! that's impossible}
<C>__{albatross}
<D>__{straight up mate. biggest creatures ever lived. decimated, mate.}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{so if i wanted to talk to them, where would i go}
<C>__{albatross}
<D>__{anywhere and everywhere. over the sea, under the sea, jees, i've even seen them fly. the great southland's swarming with em}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{where's that. do you think the whale would take me there?}
<A>__{the blue whale responds with a long mournful "no o o o" which the albatross does not need to translate.}
<C>__{albatross}
<D>__{no way mate, he won't go anywhere near `em. and neither should you.}
<A>__{mumble hesitates, bobbing on the water, weighing the warnings. he makes up his mind and strikes out again swimming towards the convergence. the albatross, hovering on the wing, watches.}
<C>__{albatross }
<D>__{don't say i didn't warn you}
<A>__{the albatross wheels away. as mumble fights on through the huge choppy waves, the whale's wagnerian song booms out, eerie and forlorn.}
<B>__{the convergence}
<A>__{we see from above, the blue whale turning as well, changing course to avoid a change in the texture and colour of the water stretching in a line, as far as the eye can see. mumble swims right across the line.}
<B>__{a vast ocean}
<A>__{mumble is a mere dot now as the great currents capture him and sweep him away. we pull back through the clouds until the very curvature of the earth is visible: a blue horizon with no land in sight.}
<B>__{small polluted beach}
<A>__{on the high water mark, amongst the rubbish and the oil slick, we see what looks like a dead animal. it is mumble. a creature in red gumboots approaches. its small hand reaches down and nudges him with a stick. mumble moans and the gumboots run away, shouting something unintelligible. with great difficulty, mumble raises his head to try to see more. sunlight flares, bleaching to white, as he loses}
<B>__{consciousness. a white room}
<A>__{scientific books and specimens of birds in large bottles on shelves line the walls. mumble, eyes closed, is lying on a stainless steel table. he opens his eyes to the brilliant glare of an examination lamp. there is movement around him. voices whispering in an alien tongue. a figure in white bends over him cleaning the oil from his feathers with detergent. mumble squawks.}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{when i finally saw one, the alien was even more hideous than i'd imagined}
<A>__{a very pretty female scientist is smiling down at him.}
<D>__{mumble (vo) (cont'd) ... frontways eyes, no feathers. big teeth with blood around them. strange fleshy beak. a meat eater}
<C>__{mumble }
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{the fish are ours. understand?}
<A>__{but all the scientist sees is a squawking penguin.}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{we can't live without them!}
<A>__{the scientist produces a syringe and squirts some of it's contents in the air.}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{speak adelie? skua talk?}
<A>__{another scientist holds him still while the needle is administered.}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{oh no! not the pointy thing!}
<A>__{drowsy now, he is eased into a padded cage. the scientists close the lid, and secure it with straps.}
<B>__{in the cargo hold}
<A>__{we hear a feeble thumping from inside. pull back to reveal mumble's box on a shelf among crates and luggage. fade in engine noise over as....}
<B>__{endless sky}
<A>__{a 747 drones across the screen, eastwards into the night.}
<B>__{darkness}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{i woke in darkness. unable to move. was i dead? and if i was dead, where was that light coming from}
<A>__{like the light at the end of a tunnel. as if in a dream, mumble ambles towards it. emerging into}
<B>__{penguin heaven}
<A>__{bright blue sky, sparkling white cliffs of ice.}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{wow. they brought me home}
<A>__{his voice echoes back at him, with a mocking edge. there is something unusual about this place. a plump penguin waddles by}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{excuse me, where are we.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{heaven. where d'you think?}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{oh. so we're dead. right}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{dunno. don't care. we got food. we got water. you hear a seal now and then, but you never meet one. perfect.}
<A>__{mumble is looking around, trying to figure it out}
<C>__{penguin }
<D>__{fish!}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{a fish hits him on the head. a moment later he's knocked flat by a sudden rush of penguins: chinstraps, rock hoppers, adelies, king penguins, emerging from holes in the rock face}
<C>__{penguins}
<D>__{fish time. fish time!}
<A>__{lying on his back he sees fish tumble from the sky. it's raining fish!}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{every day after that, it rained fish in the afternoon.}
<A>__{his pov, load after load of fish tumbling out of a clear sky}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{fish hit the surface and sink}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{fish on land and fish underwater.}
<A>__{mumble pursues one of them.}
<C>__{mumble}
<D>__{sometime you got a live one but there was nowhere really to chase it}
<A>__{he swims slap bang into a sheet of thick glass. alien faces are pressed against it. mumble yells and shoots to the surface.}
<B>__{the penguin enclosure}
<A>__{high up he sees the viewing gallery. a great crowd of aliens staring and chattering}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{aliens everywhere, watching you eat, watching you sleep}
<A>__{mumble backs away and knocks into the painted horizon. he puts out a wing to steady himself and notices a metal tag on it. this place is beginning to upset him.}
<C>__{mumble}
<P>__{(yells at the aliens)}
<D>__{what have you done to my wing! this is not my home! i want to get out of here!}

<D>__{...just take what comes and live inside your mind}
<A>__{the same passage of time another day and another. night follows day follows night. spectators come and go. the penguins stand like statues. though bubbles begin to appear above mumbles head, snapshots of his past experiences}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{sometimes i thought about dad and mum. sometimes the amigos, and others i'd met along the way. but mostly i thought about ella, wondering who she ended up with. whether she had enough food to eat. whether she still remembered our song.}

<D>__{you like that? well how about this.}
<A>__{he does a more elaborate step. the mother shouts in disbelief. various other specators come back and join her. mumbles fellow captives are unimpressed.}

<A>__{they shuffle away}

<B>__{a conference room}
<A>__{suited figures are seated round a large table, watching as images of the dancing penguin colony play on a video screen. without the music it's less obviously a dance.}
<C>__{chairman}
<D>__{...so what do you reckon?}
<C>__{expert}
<D>__{yes, quite extraordinary. (stares at the screen) some kind of neurological disorder? a nutritional deficiency perhaps. we'd certainly back the long term study.}
<C>__{chairman}
<D>__{and the international treaty? delegate#1 yes. this is exactly the leverage we need for an embargo. no fishing whatsoever...legal, illegal, sanctioned, whatever. delegate#2 so we all step up policing of the pirate factory ships. and we pressure that country to stop their so called `experimental' fishing. delegate#3 yes, if our government asks your government to approach their government to call off their fleet... delegate#2 better if their government hear it from our government via your government...}
<C>__{chairman}
<D>__{what the heck. the amount of publicity this is generating, they'd have world war three if they didn't stop.}
<B>__{the colony}
<A>__{in the confusion of penguins we find mumble, ella and their chick}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{ella's gave up teaching to look after our chick. we take turns looking after her and going to get the fish.}
<A>__{as we watch, ella moves off, joining the great to and fro of penguins along the highway to the sea. mumble covers his chick protectively, watrching his wife walk away.}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{i worry about her, sure. theres so much big stuff out there it can be kind of frightening.}
<A>__{we are pulling back now, back from the colony, back from antarctica.}
<C>__{mumble }
<D>__{but the way i see it. theres so much out there we don't understand...,}
<B>__{space}
<A>__{still pulling back}
<D>__{....the stuff you think is small stuff could actually be the big stuff.}
<A>__{keep pulling back from the world, the solar system, the galaxy.}
<D>__{mumble (v.0 or am i not making sense here?}
<A>__{further back. our galaxy is framed in something like a bomb sight.}
<D>__{voice#1 is there a problem? i thought this one was barren.}
<B>__{in the dome}
<A>__{we`re somewhere otherworldly, inside a clear dome the size of a stadium, with a view of the heavens. in the centre of this space, always just out of shot, two illdefined figures are talking, subtitled:}
<D>__{voice#2 more or less. but one of the stars we're harvesting supports these things here.}
<A>__{projected somehow in mid air a 3 d image of times square in winter with tiny people milling around in black coats}
<D>__{voice#1 so...? voice#2 well. exactly. but what we didn't know about before was these things here}
<A>__{an image of the dancing penguins appears.}
<P>__{voice#2 (cont'd)}
<D>__{just thought you'd want to see them before...you know.}
<A>__{the shadowy figure laughs, enjoying the image.}
<D>__{voice#1 hmm. charming voice#2 so. we go ahead. or...? voice#1 no. better leave them be. see what sector twelves got to offer instead.}
<A>__{the bomb sight moves away from our galaxy to another part of the universe with that the two figures head off across the great shadowy interior. the projector beam catches them, briefly, throwing up the giant shadows of these aliens they look very like huge penguins. as they walking solemnly out of shot with their hands behind their backs one of them breaks step to do a little jig.}
<B>__{run titles the end}
