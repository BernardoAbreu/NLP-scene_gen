<A>__{the sky is showing the first signs of approaching dawn. she watches our guy's ghost moving into the woods, back toward the direction from which they came. she stands there, exhausted, spent. suddenly a familiar song begins to chime on her cellphone ringtone:}
<C>__{cellphone}
<P>__{("rockin around the x mas tree...")}
<D>__{ding da da ding, da ding da ding...}
<A>__{her eyes widen in terror. she fumbles out the cellphone. stabs the "off" button with her thumb. she instinctively starts back to the stranded oldsmobile stops looks at the ghost. and in that moment decides, for better or worse, to follow him. she takes off down the road. we follow as she hurries to catch up with our guy's ghost.}

<P>__{(crying; breathless)}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{she's close enough now to hear that he's mumbling something.}
<C>__{guy's ghost}
<D>__{...i would've told you everything eventually...}
<A>__{exhausted, she's having trouble keeping up with him.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{guy's ghost}
<D>__{...then it wouldn't be stalkerish.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{i know!}
<C>__{guy's ghost}
<D>__{... it would just be this sweet funny story we'd have...}
<A>__{but it's no use. she stops trying to keep up and pauses briefly, devastated, catching her breath. then she pushes on in the direction he went.}
