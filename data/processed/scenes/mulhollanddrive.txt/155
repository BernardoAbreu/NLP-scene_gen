<D>__{your aunt called me.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i was afraid of that.}
<C>__{coco}
<D>__{she wants to know who's staying in her apartment.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(slowly, deliberately)}
<D>__{it's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. i tried to explain that to aunt ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. i kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any ritas ...}

<D>__{sweetie, look at me straight.}
<A>__{betty lifts her eyes to coco's. direct, clear.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{coco...she's very nice. we went to school together.}
<C>__{coco}
<D>__{so i guess your grandpa and grandma know her.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{not really. i met her in junior college and she was from this other town.}
<A>__{coco looks hard into betty's innocent face.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{you can call my grandparents ... i'm sure they'd tell you that i don't lie and i sure wouldn't allow a stranger to invade my aunt ruth's apartment.}
<C>__{coco}
<D>__{honey... i was married to a director for thirty years. he had an uncanny ability to read people. maybe some of it rubbed off on me or maybe i had it all along ... you're a good kid... what you're telling me is a load of horse pucky but it comes from a good place. i will trust you to sort this out. now i'm not going against ruth. she's got enough to worry about up there in canada. if she asks i'm going to say everything is okay, and you make sure it is.}

<D>__{if you need any help you know where to find me.}
<A>__{betty puts her hand on coco's shoulder and gives her a squeeze.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{you're really something coco...thank you.}
<C>__{coco}
<D>__{don't make me out to be a sucker. louise bonner says there's trouble in there. you remember last night. sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble get rid of it.}
<A>__{coco turns and walks away. betty studies her and thinks about what she said before turning and going back inside.}
