<L>__{extreme close up: face of alexa woods}
<A>__{dressed head to toe in extreme cold weather gear, face mask, and boots with crampons (spiked metal devices strapped to the bottom of boot). legend: nepal wide: lex is climbing the khumba ice waterfall, a four thousand foot frozen waterfall that begins eighteen thousand feet in the air and crests at twenty two thousand feet. lex has nearly reached the top, her mind focused on a specific rhythm and routine. swing the axe, kick the crampon, pull and move up. again. calm, deliberate, always careful to keep her balance. swing the axe, kick the crampon, pull and move up. again. she is meticulous in every step. lex anchors her safety line by screwing an ice screw into the face of the waterfall. grains of snow fall over her face as the screw is driven in. water trickles deep within the ice. lex relaxes for a second as the carabiner snaps shut and secures her to the anchor. hard wind blows over. other than that sound, everything is quiet on the ice climb. she catches her breath and starts again. swing the axe, kick the crampon, pull and move up. again. and again. and again. she stops. right at the edge of the top. she takes a minute to look at the world from here her moment of peace is shattered by modern communication. her gsm phone rings. she's clearly surprised that anyone should be calling. lex checks the number, doesn't recognize it, but the phone won't stop ringing. she takes an earpiece and carefully slides it into her ear.}

<C>__{max}
<D>__{he said he didn't have a week.}
<A>__{and lex stands up, unhooks her safety lines and finds herself staring at a perfect pair of qxford brogues, belonging to maxwell stafford, an elegant man of afro caribbean descent. a bell 212 helicopter sits behind him. all waiting for her arrival. she's speechless.}
