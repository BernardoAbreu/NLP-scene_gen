<A>__{the screen is composed of large, straight edge areas of black and white that rest against each other in a manner that suggests some kind of pattern, without making a final sense; it is as if we are too close to something that, could we see it from a distance, would be clear to us. these areas shift and change both their own shape and their relationship to their neighbors. new patterns are being made, new solutions found but they are just beyond our comprehension. the effect should be aesthetically pleasing but simultaneously frustrating and, perhaps, a little unsettling. shortly into this sequence, and subsequently inter cut throughout, we begin to see, in flashback, the story of hellraiser. arriving first as very short shock images, these brief sections eventually convey to the audience all the necessary emotional and narrative information they will need to understand the background to hellbound. meanwhile, the black and white shapes are still moving, the unseen patterns still shifting. over this constantly mobile background, the titles begin to appear. as the titles unroll, another change comes over the puzzle pieces behind them. where before they moved and related only in two dimensions, gradually we see that they are now claiming depth as well. the puzzle we are looking at is now a three dimensional one. the pieces are now solid blocks of various geometric shapes, locking together, moving apart, finding their final position. finally, as the titles come to their conclusion, the camera pulls back until we can see clearly what we have been looking at. as the final piece clicks into positions we see it is the lament configuration from hellraiser. the closed box rests before our eyes a moment and then the circle in the centre of the side that faces us gives way to an image of a dusty street with a market. simultaneous to this, the camera tracks into this image until it fills the screen}
