<L>__{exterior house, top of basement flat stairs same}
<A>__{coraline climbs the stairs up to ground level, intrigued by her fortune.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{danger?}
<A>__{behind her, a periscope rises from the waist deep fog. coraline just catches it in her peripheral view. she frowns but doesn't let on she's aware of it. she walks ahead nonchalantly, the periscope following her, then suddenly turns and grabs it, pulling up wybie, then punches him in the arm.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{owwwwwwww!}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{great, the village stalker.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{ow. i i wasn't stalking you. we're hunting banana slugs.}
<A>__{wybie takes some salad tongs from a tool belt, snaps them.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{what d'ya mean, "we?"}
<A>__{there's a soft meowing from under his coat. he opens it up and the black cat emerges and climbs onto his shoulders.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{ha! your cat's not wild, he's a wuss puss!}
<A>__{cat glares at her angrily.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{what? he hates to get his feet wet. geez.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(mocking)}
<D>__{wuss puss...}
<A>__{tired of her company, the cat jumps off wybie, onto a tree and up onto the roof of the house. coraline softens.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{so... that doll. did you make it look like me?}
<A>__{wybie, scanning under the ground fog for slugs, sticks his head up for a moment.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{oh no; i found it that way. it's older than gramma old as this house prob'ly.}
<A>__{coraline is highly skeptical. wybie returns to his hunt.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(points to self)}
<D>__{c'mom blue hair, my swampers and raincoat?}
<A>__{wybie stands excitedly and presents a huge yellow green slug to coraline.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{dang, check out slugzilla!}
<A>__{she's not impressed.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{you're just like them.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{he looks from the slug to himself.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{i meant my parents; they don't listen to me either.}
<A>__{wybie nods, not listening again, takes his camera }
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{uh huh... you mind?}
<A>__{ hands it to her. she acts put out, but frames a shot. he signals he's ready and she fires off one auto flash shot after another as he strikes silly poses making sound effects: horrified of the slug one moment; ready to eat it the next; pretending it's something from his nose in another. she can't help but giggle.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{ew!}
<A>__{finished, wybie tosses the slug back into the fog, and takes the camera back. he lowers his head, thoughtful, then glances up past coraline at the house. he sighs and speaks in a sad tone.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{you know, i've never been inside the pink palace.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(sceptical)}
<D>__{you're kidding.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{grandma would kill me. thinks it's dangerous or something.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{dangerous?}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{well... she had a twin sister.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{so? wybie (o.c.). when they were kids, grandma's sister disappeared.}
<P>__{(on camera)}
<D>__{she says she was stolen.}
<C>__{coraline }
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{stolen?}
<A>__{angle from roof, over cat's shoulder as dialog continues. cat senses something and turns it's coraline's doll at the window, looking like it's spying on things.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{well, what do you think?}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{uhhh, i i don't know.}
<A>__{back to kids. wybie, astride his electric bike now, whistles and the black cat jumps down from the roof, onto his shoulders.}
<C>__{wybie }
<D>__{maybe she just ran away?}
<A>__{we hear wybie's agitated grandmother call out.}
<C>__{wybie's grandmother }
<D>__{wyborne!}
<A>__{wybie turns away: he's said too much.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{look, i gotta go.}
<A>__{he starts to pull away.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{wait a minute!}
<A>__{and he's gone. push in on her pensive face.}
