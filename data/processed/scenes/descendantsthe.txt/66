<L>__{interior matt's bedroom night}
<A>__{matt sits on the bed, listening once again to brian speer's outgoing message.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(on the beep)}
<D>__{yeah, hi, brian. my name's, uh, herb fitzmorris. i'm interested in that house you've got on koloa street, the one with the plantation shutters. i'm at 645 2796. thanks.}
<L>__{interior hospital hallway day}
<A>__{as matt leads his daughters toward elizabeth's room }
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{let me go in for just a quick moment alone first. i will be right out.}
<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{matt closes the glass door behind him and slides the privacy curtain across it. he looks at his wife. she's starting to look different her face more gaunt, her hair more matted. since the last time we saw her, other items have been added around her bed. along with draped leis, we see a childhood doll, diplomas, and of course sports medals and ribbons. an antique quilt covers her legs. her father meant it when he said they'd bring her old things. matt crouches down bedside.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you were going to ask me for a divorce? so you could be with some fucking fuckhead brian speer? are you kidding me? who are you? because the only thing i know for sure is that you're a goddamned liar. so what do you have to say for yourself? go ahead, make a little joke and tell me i've got it all wrong. tell me again i'm too out of touch with my feelings and need to go to therapy.}
<P>__{(then )}
<D>__{isn't the idea of marriage to make your partner's way in life a little easier? for me it was always harder with you. and you're still making it harder. lying there on a ventilator and still fucking up my life. you're relentless. you know what? i was going to ask you for a divorce some day.}
<C>__{matt }
<P>__{(grabbing a doll, tossing it)}
<D>__{daddy's little girl.}
<A>__{matt rises, looks at her motionless face, exhales, gets himself together.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{i'm bringing in your daughters now. alex is home from school. try to be nice, okay?}
<A>__{he slides the curtain open and lets the girls in.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{hi, mom! look who's here.}
<A>__{alexandra approaches the bed slowly, startled by the changes in her mother's appearance and knowing the end is near.}
<C>__{scottie }
<D>__{say something, alex. people in a coma can hear you. you're supposed to talk to them.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{hi, mom.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{tell her how you were drunk the other night. tell her maybe you're an alcoholic.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{i guess it's in the genes.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{girls, be serious.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{hi, mom. sorry for being bad. for wasting your money on expensive private schools. money you could have used on facials and massages and sports equipment. sorry for everything.}
<P>__{(looking at matt)}
<D>__{sorry we weren't good enough for you especially dad.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{stop it. that's out of line.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{or what? you going to ground me? or ship me off to another boarding school? you going to give me a "time out?"}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{goddammit!}
<A>__{unable, in front of scottie, to remind alex that elizabeth is dying, matt grabs his older daughter and spanks her.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{you got served!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{scottie, out in the hall.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{she's the one out of line.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{go find sid.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{he's smoking. i shouldn't be around second hand smoke.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(raising his hand)}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{as scottie runs outside }
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{did you just spank me?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you have no right to talk to your mother that way. she's going to die in a few days. what if those were your last words?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{i have every right to speak this way. i'm mad at her. how can you be so forgiving?}
<A>__{matt considers this. of course she didn't see his recent outburst, and he's not about to let on.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i will be angry later. for now let's just think about the good parts.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{and don't say that stuff in front of your sister. don't ruin her for scottie. say something else.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{look, mom, i know we fought a lot. but i always wanted to be like you. i am like you. i'm exactly like you. god, that came out so dramatic.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you are like her. mostly in good ways. maybe some bad ways. remains to be seen.}
<A>__{sid saunters inside with scottie in tow.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i hear you got spanked. i hear all hell's breaking loose in here.}
<P>__{(approaching the bed)}
<D>__{hey, mrs. k., howzit? i'm sid, alex's friend from punahou, remember? nice day outside. no clouds. not too hot. you know what i think? tough lady like you? i think you're going to make it. i mean, i'm no doctor. what do i know? but that's what i think.}
<A>__{matt squints at sid. is he stoned?}
<C>__{sid }
<D>__{i'm staying at your place to help alex out. don't worry, mr. k.'s got me on lockdown at night. and i met your dad he packs a mean punch. look at this.}
<P>__{(bringing his face closer)}
<D>__{wow. you're beautiful.}
<P>__{(to alexandra)}
<D>__{if you look anything like her when you're older, you're lucky. i mean, you know, not exactly like she is now. i mean in general.}
<A>__{sid turns back for a long look at elizabeth.}
<C>__{scottie}
<P>__{(looking at her phone)}
<D>__{reina just texted me! she's here visiting her grandma! can she come visit?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{dammit, scottie, no reina.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{but you said thursday, and it's almost thursday. i don't get to see her in school anymore.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{not now.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{i need her. alex needs sid. i need reina.}
<A>__{matt looks at alex, who in turn raises her eyebrows what harm could it do? later scottie pushes open the door, now accompanied by her friend reina, 12, who looks around as if the room is dirty. she wears a terry cloth tennis skirt and hooded terry cloth sweatshirt.}
<C>__{scottie }
<D>__{dad, this is reina. reina, that's my sister and sid, and that's my mom on the bed.}
<C>__{reina}
<D>__{hi, everybody.}
<A>__{alex and matt look at each other, bewildered. scottie leads reina to the bed and touches her mother's shoulder.}
<C>__{reina }
<D>__{so this is your mother? i guess it's true. should i shake her hand?}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{if you want.}
<C>__{reina}
<D>__{no, thanks.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{so, reina, i hear your grandmother's not feeling well.}
<C>__{reina}
<D>__{yeah. it's pretty bad. she got her stomach operated on and then got some stupid infection or something. it's pretty gross.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{well, reina, thanks for stopping by, and, here, scottie, let me give you some money, and you two can go get an ice cream or something...}
<C>__{reina}
<D>__{too many carbs.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{carbs. well, you could go to the cafeteria and get some lettuce.}
<C>__{reina}
<D>__{that's okay. i'm done.}
<P>__{(to scottie, on her way out)}
<D>__{you aren't a liar after all.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{don't you want to hang out?}
<C>__{reina}
<D>__{no, i should go. i will see you at the club. hope your mom gets better.}
<A>__{exit reina.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{scottie, what'd she mean by "you aren't a liar after all?" what'd she think you were lying about?}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{she didn't believe mom was sleeping.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{so you had to prove to that twat that mom's in a coma? what the fuck is in your skull, a bunch of stupid pills?}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{shut up, you motherless whore!}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{whoa, whoa, easy there, half pipe.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{where'd you learn how to talk like that?}
<A>__{scottie points at alex. matt's phone rings. he pulls it out to silence it but notices the caller id kaimana prudential real estate. he freezes. sensing something, alex calmly grabs the phone from him and glances at it.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{hello? no, you've got the right number. this is his assistant sharon. how may i help you?}
<A>__{alex listens. scottie has no idea what's going on, but it sure is fun.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{who is it?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{oh, i see. and for how long? uh huh. okay. so one or the other. i will tell him. mahalo.}
<A>__{alexandra hangs up, proud. matt's proud too.}
<C>__{alexandra }
<D>__{that was bonnie tanaka, a realtor. she says mr. speer is on kaua'i till the 18th, but she'd be happy to show you the house or you can stop by the open house on sunday.}
