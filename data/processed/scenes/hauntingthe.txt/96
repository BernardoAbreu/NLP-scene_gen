<A>__{the painting is right there now. the letters have been erased.}
<L>__{interior nell's room night}
<A>__{we see the ledger, and pull back, and the ledger is in nell's lap. nell sits on the bed in her sleeping tee shirt and undies. theo looks at the book with her.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{that's so sad.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{there's hundreds of them. this must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like luke said.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{before he painted your name over mister crain.}
<A>__{theo hands her the bottle. nell takes it, tops off her glass, spilling. her face is red. she grimaces as she tosses back a big swallow.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{you really think it was luke?}
<A>__{theo takes another swig. she holds bottles of nail polish up next to nell's bare feet, testing the colors.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{well, it wasn't me. mister dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you said the good doctor was with you.}
<C>__{nell}
<P>__{(pondering)}
<D>__{i don't know what to think anymore.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{just think about one thing right now: what color?}
<A>__{nell finally puts the book down and takes a drink.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i've never had a pedicure before.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{red.}
<P>__{(into this now)}
<D>__{what else?}
<A>__{theo smiles and takes nell's foot gently in her hand. she begins to paint her toenails.}
<C>__{theo }
<D>__{see, isn't this better than a hit on the head?}
<A>__{nell looks down her long legs at theo.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i'm sorry i was mad at you, theo.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{me too. although i learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself. you can be a pretty decent bitch.}
<A>__{nell shoots down the rest of the glass of wine.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i will take that as a compliment.}
<P>__{(beat, trying to sound casual)}
<D>__{in the city, what kind of place do you live in?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{i have a loft.}
<A>__{nell is thrilled with this.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{a loft. that's a lot of room for one person. probably. maybe there's room for...}
<A>__{theo looks up, understands what she's asking.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{you want to move to new york, you want to move in with me?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i don't know, you know...}
<A>__{nell lies back, arms spread, lets the glass roll out of her hand. theo paints nell's toenails one by one, carefully guiding the brush strokes in along the skin. nell, unused to this, gives into the pleasure, and theo sees how easy it is to move nell.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{my place isn't like yours, nell, it doesn't have a view of sea. it doesn't have a view of anything. what's interesting about the way i live is what goes on inside the walls. living with me... my boundaries aren't very well defined, nell. do you know what i mean?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i'm trying. have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.}
<A>__{theo looks up at her, unreadable.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{all the time.}
<A>__{nell lets out a sigh. gently theo's hand moves down the arch of nell's foot. caressing. nell lets her. theo finishes nell's last little toe, and then with the brush out of paint, runs it gently up the inside of nell's calf. nell sighs. theo lowers her face near nell's toes, licks her lips: soft, near, red. she blows. nell raises herself up, peers down at theo. sees the want on her face. a long beat. nell breaks the gaze, looks away. theo reads nell's look, and releases her foot. she sits back in the chair. for a moment nell doesn't know what to do.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{i better go to bed.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{okay.}
