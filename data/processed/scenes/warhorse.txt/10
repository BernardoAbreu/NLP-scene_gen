<L>__{exterior paddock. another day.}
<A>__{albert's friend, andrew easton, sits on a rock with an apple in hand to watch the training. albert sets joey in a spot and tells him to wait.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{whoa. i want you to stay there, joey. stay. that's it. good boy. that's it, you've got it.}
<A>__{of course when albert walks away, joey follows. a game of "grandma's footsteps" ensues as albert patiently places joey then walks away.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{hey, look at him, albie. he's playing "grandma's footsteps."}
<A>__{albert patiently leads joey back to his starting position.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{right, come on, joey. back you go. come on. back you go.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{you're all right. that's it. good boy. right. you've gotta stay there, understand?}
<A>__{albert walks away again.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{that's it. good boy. you've got it. good boy.}
<A>__{finally joey stays put. andrew smiles, impressed.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{good boy. good.}
<P>__{(to albert)}
<D>__{now call him. whistle.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{come now, joey. come on.}
<A>__{albert whistles like an owl. joey stands completely still.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{you can come now, joey.}
<A>__{he whistles again. joey remains still.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{don't think he fancies your owls.}
<A>__{albert walks back to joey, frustrated.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{no, i read it in a story. it's how the indians used to summon their horses.}
<A>__{he gently strokes joey's nose.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{now, joey, when i whistle, you've gotta come, understand?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{my dad had a dog who stayed when you called him. he used to run up behind you when you weren't looking, and uh...}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{he's not a dog. he's just puzzling it through.}
<A>__{albert runs further away than before and whistles. after a moment, joey trots over to him. andrew smiles broadly.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{brilliant. look at you.}
<A>__{with the basis established, albert begins to train joey to react to the owl whistle without his prompting. it's not all easy going sometimes albert makes progress, sometimes not. quick montage mrs. narracott fills a bucket at the pump, then promptly spills it when joey trots past her in response to an owl whistle. she calls off, frustrated.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{albie.}
<A>__{dad heads out to the fields with a rake on his shoulder. there's an owl call and joey trots past him in the background. dad sees albert welcome joey by the haystacks, stroking his nose affectionately. dad walks on, his expression inscrutable. joey trots up a path, pursuing another owl call. after several more calls, he still can't spot albert, until he cranes his neck up and sees albert sitting in a nearby tree. albert laughs.}
