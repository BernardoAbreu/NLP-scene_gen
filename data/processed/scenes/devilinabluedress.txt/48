<A>__{ben webster's "i've got it bad" plays on the road as easy shifts nervously in his seat, his eyes searching in the rearview mirror and all around for headlights that might be unfriendly. daphne leans back against the passenger door, taking him in. easy passes a police car pulled over to the side. he looks in the rearview mirror and its headlights go on. he takes a deep breath, bracing for the worst and daphne looks back concerned. but the lights arch a u turn and head back the other way.}
