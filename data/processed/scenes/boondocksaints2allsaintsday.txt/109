<L>__{interior luxury apartment night}
<A>__{a demolished environment. the towering windows are blown out, providing a threatening view of the city below. here, eunice stands, looking out over the panorama.}
<C>__{eunice}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{on a sultry saturday in september the saints saved seventeen souls...try saying that five times fast.}
<A>__{she turns and walks the marble floor which is like a runway, lined with pulverized statues. a long table of ravaged food extends. crime scene personnel toil. ritualized bodies everywhere. greenly is by the panic room. he pushes the "talk" button.}
<C>__{greenly}
<D>__{come on. there's nothing to be afraid of. it's all over.}
<P>__{(turns)}
<D>__{he won't come out.}
<A>__{he joins dolly and duffy who stand on the periphery. eunice is dead center, absorbing the scene when suddenly, fbi agent john kuntsler barrels in with his g men #1 #3.}
<C>__{kuntsler}
<D>__{special agent bloom! you are hereby relieved of all obligation to this investigation.}
<A>__{he holds up his i.d. a collective groan from crime scene personnel.}
<C>__{kuntsler }
<D>__{that's right, kids. this crime scene is now under the full jurisdiction of your beloved federal government. as of now, you will all report to me, special agent john kuntsler.}
<A>__{the detectives look to kuntsler's g men as if squaring off.}
<C>__{kuntsler }
<D>__{don't let us interrupt you. just don't forget to turn over everything you find. we have people standing by ready to take credit for all your hard work.}
<A>__{he chuckles as all return to work. kuntsler turns to eunice.}
<C>__{kuntsler }
<D>__{so, how ya doin', bloomy?}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{just fine...cunty.}
<A>__{kuntsler's shit eating grin disappears. he leans in. hushed tones.}
<C>__{kuntsler}
<D>__{nice little science project you got going with these three goofballs.}
<P>__{(re: detectives)}
<D>__{you trying to turn them into your own little junior g men? well, you can put sprinkles on shit, bloom, but it's still shit. so, you and your keystone cops can all go home now and let the professionals handle this?}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{boy. i'd love to hear a gen u wine professional's assessment of a crime scene. how 'bout you, detectives?}
<A>__{dolly, duffy and greenly chorus the affirmative. kuntsler looks unsure then phonies up some bravado. looks around...}
<C>__{kuntsler}
<D>__{o'kay. seems pretty obvious. the door was broken down. we've got our point of entry. the assailants fired in this direction.}
<P>__{(points toward windows)}
<C>__{kuntsler }
<D>__{explains the windows. the victims were...}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{there are three inaccuracies in what you just said. number one, david.}
<C>__{greenly}
<D>__{if the windows were shattered by gunfire coming from inside the room, the glass would have been blown outward. as you can see, most of it is on the inside.}
<A>__{kuntsler looks. sure enough. his eyes widen.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{number two, dolly.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{blood splatters in the direction of the rounds fired. if the assailants discharged toward the windows, the blood would follow suit. here, the majority of splatter is in the opposing direction.}
<A>__{kuntsler looks. sure enough.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{number three, duffy.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{trick question. there is no number three. he only fucked up twice.}
<C>__{eunice}
<P>__{(whistles)}
<D>__{looks like bloomy aced her science project.}
<A>__{kuntsler's men look embarrassed.}
<C>__{kuntsler}
<D>__{that was just off the...i would have seen the blood thing...i haven't even had time to...}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{why don't you let me take a crack at it, john? won't cost you nuthin'.}
<C>__{kuntsler}
<D>__{and just why would i do that?}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{cuz, tonight...mamma's right on time.}
