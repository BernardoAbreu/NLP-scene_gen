<A>__{on harry and the nurse, as before:}
<C>__{nurse one}
<D>__{i assume you're a fairly recent associate of the doctor's?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's very correct.}
<C>__{nurse one}
<D>__{uhm hmmm... what do you specialize in?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'd say female troubles, mainly.}
<C>__{nurse one}
<D>__{oh, so dr. park feels there's a gynecological involvement here.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sometimes he does, yes.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{by the way, did anyone ever tell you what attractive eyebrows you have?}
<C>__{nurse one}
<P>__{(thrown)}
<D>__{oh, well, no, they haven't...}
<A>__{her attention is diverted to a second nurse entering the wing, calling out to her and making a summoning gesture:}
<C>__{nurse one}
<D>__{excuse me a minute, doctor.}
<A>__{harry watches as she moves away, and while the two nurses engage in an exchange some distance down the hall, he steps back to the door, opens it and sticks his head inside:}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{of joan and andy, the former whispering urgently in ref erence to the latter's red hair:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{what about her hair?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{who's he?}
<B>__{on old man}
<A>__{now snoozing in the wheelchair. harry's hand moves into frame and deftly removes his hat.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{of the second nurse on her way back to the main corridor, while nurse one is returning to harry. as she comes up to him:}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{nurse one}
<D>__{that was my superior. she tells me dr. park is in surgery and she suggests that you wait in the administrative lounge until we can get a hold of him. would that be alright?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{certainly.}
<A>__{he moves to the door, opens it, blocking the nurse's view into it with his body.}
<B>__{his pov of joan}
<A>__{looking frightened at her imminent abandonment.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{don't worry mrs. ellerman, we'll be right back.}
<A>__{andy, wearing dark glasses and with her hair hidden up under the stingy brim hat, steps out into the hallway.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{harry takes her by the arm and looks amiably toward the nurse.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{which way?}
<C>__{nurse one}
<P>__{(gesturing a direction)}
<D>__{that way, doctor, and thank you very much for your patience.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{don't mention it.}
<A>__{the nurse watches briefly as they move away, then extracting a key from her pocket, she steps over to the door and locks it.}
