<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes, i've been hearing all about you.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{that must have been very boring for you.}
<A>__{the ringing sound of the wheel tapper's hammer is faintly audible in anna's hesitation. anna shuts off the gallantry.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{au revoir, countess.}
<C>__{countess vronsky}
<D>__{au revoir, my dear. let me kiss your pretty face.}
<A>__{countess vronsky does so. anna turns to offer her hand to vronsky. as vronsky takes her hand, the train lurches and moves, unsteadying them both.}
