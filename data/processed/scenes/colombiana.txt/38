<A>__{cat holds up the envelope from the headmistresses office. montage day night the landscape of america passes by through the window of a bus. clutching a new lara croft comic, nibbling on a big mac and fries out of a bag, cat sees... the sugar cane harvests in the florida wetlands. two big fat black women sitting on the porch of a shack shelling peas in the deep south. the steel mills of pittsburgh fire up. the endless expanse of corn and wheat stretching from horizon to horizon across ohio. the giant milk barns of indiana with their hundreds of cows. and finally, sees the great city of chicago looming in the distance as the bus hurls down the highway towards it.}
