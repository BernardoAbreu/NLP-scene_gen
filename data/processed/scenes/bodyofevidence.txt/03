<L>__{exterior residential street night}
<A>__{lightning fills the night sky. thunder booms overhead. the wind whips the rain furiously against anything in its path. the camera moves slowly along rows of beautiful homes. at the end is a cul de sac. several police cars are in the driveway, their red lights flashing. a four door sedan pulls into the driveway. john cardenas steps out into the rain. he is a handsome latin in his thirties, with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked backed hair. he does not run through the rain he walks. detective reese, a man who looks more like an accountant than a homicide detective runs out to meet him.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{is it marsh?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{just a hint of sadness shows on cardenas' face. it lasts an instant, then it's gone.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{sir, do you mind if we get out of the rain?}
<A>__{cardenas doesn't move. he ignores the question.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{who found him?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{his secretary. joanne braslow.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{she was here?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{no. she stopped by to pick up some papers.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{show me.}
<A>__{reese starts for the house. cardenas looks up into the night sky. a flash of lightning fills the screen.}
