<L>__{interior baxter building lab day}
<A>__{reed and sue, tables turned: reed observes her through a prismatic device measuring light refraction. he "sees" her through the device: lit up like some heavenly creature. he's having a hard time concentrating. he focuses on his work.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{it's not "invisibility" per se. you're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. that's what you projected on the bridge.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{what about you? you haven't eaten in days. how come you're never on this side of the microscope?}
<A>__{he tightens, uncomfortable with being center of attention. she reaches for his arm, like a specimen. he pulls away, but she sees a glimpse of bruises on his arms. she slows down.}
<C>__{sue }
<D>__{bruises...from the bridge?}
<A>__{he nods, rolls down his sleeves.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{have you had any side effects, from your powers?}
<A>__{she considers. a little vulnerable.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{i've had some headaches. migraines.}
<A>__{a beat. reed drops his eyes, makes a note, back to work.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{you should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better }
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<A>__{she is annoyed. reed is oblivious.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{i'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. can you remember the exact emotions when }
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{anger. rage. frustration.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{okay. is there any way to duplicate that feeling? some memory or...}
<C>__{sue}
<P>__{(staring right at him)}
<D>__{i'm sure i can come up with something.}
<A>__{she looks at reed, eyes narrow. she becomes invisible. as she focuses on reed and gets angry a small, clear force field forms around her body. the force field bends light around a microscope, which goes invisible. reed steps out to ask...}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{how's that coming whoa }
<A>__{the force field shoots in all directions, knocking everything over in a fifteen foot radius. reed is thrown from his chair.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i didn't mean to do that... you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or }
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{what in the world would give me that idea?}
<A>__{an awkward beat.}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{i mean, you broke up with me, right?}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{are you kidding?}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{no, i distinctly remember: you walked out my door. ergo...}
<A>__{she didn't want to get into this. she looks down, vulnerable.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{reed. i was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, i walked.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{i think it was a little more complicated than }
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{i just wanted to share an apartment. what was so complicated about that?}
<A>__{the question stumps him. a beat. he struggles.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{there were a lot of variables to consider }
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{no. there weren't. there was you. and me. no variables, no math. it was actually the simplest thing in the world. but your head got in the way... like it always does.}
<A>__{her words penetrate. he knows she's right. he looks away.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{sue...i just...i thought...}
<A>__{he struggles for the words.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{same old reed. too much thinking...}
<A>__{he opens his mouth, but...wham! doors open. johnny enters, wearing a charred shirt. he points to the burned scraps of his shirt.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{okay guys, we have a serious problem.}
