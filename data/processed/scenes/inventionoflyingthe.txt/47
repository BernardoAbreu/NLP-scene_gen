<A>__{mark and greg lounge around the bellagio penthouse suite, piles of chips and cash lying around them. greg is pacing delightedly. mark lies on the couch, unsatisfied.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{it amazes me the winning streak you're on. you must be the luckiest man in the world.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well, sort of.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{it was like we couldn't lose.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{we couldn't lose.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{do you have a system?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i've got a system.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{well, with your system in just a few weeks i figure we could be the richest people in the world.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{and then what?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{well, here's what i'm thinking. we take all the money in the world... and put it on black.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{why put it on black? why stop there? put it on a number and get thirty five times back.}
<A>__{greg's eyes widen at the thought.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{that's exactly what we'll do.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{hold on, i think i found a flaw in your plan. how can they pay us if we have all the money in the world?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{well, they'd just have to.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well, they can't because we've got it all.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{well, they'd better find it. they can't let us bet if they're not going to pay us back. they'll have to just give us the casino.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{we already own the casino. we've got all the money in the world. we'll be betting against ourselves.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{then we'll go to another casino.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{we own that one too. we won that.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{so we own all the casino's?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yup.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{and if we win we can't pay us back because we already have all the money?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{greg thinks this over for a long beat.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{only one thing we can do then.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm listening.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{take ourselves into the back room and break our own fingers.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{brilliant.}
