<A>__{jacob swallows hard as he stands there, holding the letter. suddenly his eyes lift off the page and glance at a full length mirror mounted on the bedroom door. something in the mirror, like the image of a child, seems to move. he looks over. there is nothing there. curious, jacob walks toward the mirror. as his image appears, he gasps and stops moving. to his horror and ours, it is his own back that is reflected in the mirror. the impossibility of the moment startles him. he lifts his hand. the reflection moves with him. frightened but defiant, jacob moves toward the mirror. the image in the mirror spins around. it is the frightening vibrating face he saw at the party with jezzie. an unearthly scream comes from both their mouths.}
