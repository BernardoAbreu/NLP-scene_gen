<L>__{exterior jedi temple day}
<A>__{the main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity. all sorts of jedi are coming and going.}
<L>__{interior jedi temple, archives library day}
<A>__{a bronze bust of count dooku, stands among a line of other busts of jedi in the archive room. obi wan stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face. on the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity. farther along the room in the background, five jedi are seated at tables, studying archival material. after obi wan studies the bust for a few moments before madame jocasta nu, the jedi archivist is standing next to him. she is an elderly, frail looking human jedi. tough as old boots and smart as a whip.}
<C>__{jocasta nu}
<D>__{did you call for assistance? obi wan}
<P>__{(distracted in thought)}
<D>__{yes... yes, i did...}
<C>__{jocasta nu}
<D>__{he has a powerful face, doesn't he? he was one of the most brilliant jedi i have had the privilege of knowing. obi wan i never understood why he quit. only twenty jedi have ever left the order.}
<C>__{jocasta nu}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{the lost twenty... and count dooku was the most recent and the most painful. no one likes to talk about it. his leaving was a great loss to the order. obi wan what happened?}
<C>__{jocasta nu}
<D>__{well, one might say, he was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the council... much like your old master, qui gon jinn. obi wan}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{jocasta nu}
<D>__{oh, yes. they were alike in many ways. very individual thinkers... idealists...}
<A>__{jocasta nu stares at the bust}
<C>__{jocasta nu}
<P>__{(continuing}
<D>__{he was always striving to become a more powerful jedi. he wanted to be the best. with a lightsaber, in the old style of fencing, he had no match. his knowledge of the force was... unique. in the end, i think he left because he lost faith in the republic. he believed that politics were corrupt, and he felt the jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. he always had very high expectations of government. he disappeared for nine or ten years, then he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement. obi wan interesting... i'm still not sure i understand.}
<C>__{jocasta nu}
<D>__{well, i'm sure you didn't call me over here for a history lesson. are you having a problem, master kenobi? obi wan yes, i'm trying to find a planet system called kamino. it doesn't seem to show upon any of the archive charts.}
<C>__{jocasta nu}
<D>__{kamino? it's not a system i'm familiar with... let me see...}
<A>__{jocasta nu leans over obi wan's shoulder, looking at the screen.}
<C>__{jocasta nu}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{are you sure you have the right co ordinates? obi wan}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{according to my information, it should be in this quadrant somewhere... just south of the rishi maze.}
<A>__{jocasta nu taps the keyboard and frowns.}
<C>__{jocasta nu}
<D>__{no co ordinates? it sounds like the kind of directions you'd get from a street tout... some old miner or furbog trader. obi wan all three actually.}
<C>__{jocasta nu}
<D>__{are you sure it exists? obi wan absolutely.}
<C>__{jocasta nu}
<D>__{let me do a gravitational scan.}
<A>__{obi wan and jocasta nu studt the star map hologram.}
<C>__{jocasta nu}
<D>__{there are some inconsistencies here. maybe the planet you're looking for was destroyed. obi wan wouldn't that be on record?}
<C>__{jocasta nu}
<D>__{it ought to be. unless it was very recent.}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{i hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exist. obi wan that's impossible... perhaps the archives are incomplete.}
<C>__{jocasta nu}
<D>__{the archives are comprehensive and totally secure, my young jedi. one thing you may be absolutely sure of if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!}
<A>__{obi wan stares at her, then looks back at the map.}
