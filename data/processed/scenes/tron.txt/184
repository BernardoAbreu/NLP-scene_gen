<A>__{the transmission beam is flowing, passing directly through the craft, from behind, hitting the sail bunker, and passing through, so that it looks like a headlight. the sailer starts moving, fast, accelerating so that it reaches a tremendous velocity in a matter of seconds.}
<L>__{exterior aircraft carrier bridge sark & mcp}
<A>__{back on the bridge of the carrier, sark is in the mcp hologram. in front of him, we see a view of the city below, and the hangar, and the solar sailer racing away.}

<D>__{i hope you've enjoyed being a command program, sark. i wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "happy birthday" to its user once a year.}
<C>__{sark}
<D>__{now, sir... we did take care of that user you sent us }
<C>__{mcp}
<D>__{yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.}
<C>__{sark}
<D>__{we'll get them, sir... these things take time.}
<C>__{mcp}
<D>__{i don't have time, sark. and neither do you. end of line.}
<A>__{solar sailer walkway tron from the stern. tron picks himself up from the floor where he was thrown when the sailer took off, and heads for yori (at the camera). he stops, seeing something.}
<C>__{yori v.o.}
<D>__{tron, are you all right?}
<A>__{tron waves at her... then...}
<B>__{close shot from in front of tron}
<A>__{he looks over at the guard rail.}
