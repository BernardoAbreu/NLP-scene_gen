<L>__{exterior ida's cabin sunset}
<A>__{the sun sinks on the horizon...}
<L>__{interior torture room #1}
<A>__{sheryl's tied, once again, to the table. mike tied to a chair, which is dragged into the room by clyde. sheryl sees mike's burned chest.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{this is getting out of hand, y'all. nobody wanted what just almost happened to sheryl to happen. but, you keep dragging this thing out... things are gonna... happen.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i sent deacon away for a bit. he knows he done wrong. you say right now that you are ready to perform your marital duties, then i will keep him away.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{have you ever thought that god doesn't want you to have a child? that's why he fucking kills them before they're born. because you're fucking insane monsters that don't deserve a child.}
<A>__{ida slaps mike.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{you take that back!}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{take it back.}
<A>__{ida digs her hand into mike's bear trap wound, squeezes. but mike doesn't scream or squirm. he endures the pain.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{go ahead and torture me. there's absolutely no way i would ever give a child of mine to you.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{how very brave. fine. i won't torture you.}
<P>__{(looks to sheryl)}
<D>__{i will torture her. i can bring back deacon. let him have her. plenty of other holes he can go into where a baby can't be made.}
<A>__{ida grabs a nearby knife, walks up to sheryl.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{or maybe we can just start dicing. all we need is a healthy heart, brain and uterus. she don't need the rest of her fingers, or toes... or her nose, ears. i could carve out her eye right now.}
<A>__{ida places the knife on top of sheryl's cheek, just below the eye. the tip just centimeters away from the eyeball.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{ida takes the knife away, gets in mike's face...}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{then you will give me my baby. my child, born in wedlock, saved from its sinner parents and raised to fear god and give him praise.}
<A>__{sheryl starts laughing. inappropriate, but nonetheless, she's cracking up. has she finally cracked?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{that's why you married us? so we could conceive our child in wedlock? the fucking joke's on you... i'm already pregnant. eight weeks yesterday.}
<A>__{clyde and ida stare disbelievingly at sheryl.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{you're lying.}
<A>__{mike stares in shock at sheryl. in that look, ida knows sheryl's telling the truth.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{i was trying to find the right time to tell you.}
<A>__{tears fill both their eyes.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{no, no, no, no! this can't be. no!}
<A>__{clyde grabs hold of ida, tries to calm her down. when... off screen: a glass breaks. it came from upstairs. ida and clyde spring into action. they exit the room, bolt}
<B>__{the door locked.}
<A>__{mike's pov the pocket knife still on the floor.}
