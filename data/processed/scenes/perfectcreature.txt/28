<L>__{ext: slum, street day}
<A>__{the streets are wet. high above several large zeppelins plod across the sky. we crane down to street level to find a police car pulling up through the steam. lilly gets out, jones beside her, wolfing down another bun. there are cops everywhere. an alleyway is cordoned off. the dwellers of the slum have floated up and are baying like wolves, hassling the cops; some yell obscenities, generally along the lines of "where's the police when you need them?" jones stares at the people.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{someone should flatten this cesspool and start again.}
<A>__{lilly and jones move towards the police cordon. immediately a reporter accosts them.}
<C>__{street reporter}
<D>__{marm? the tribune. do you have any comments on the death?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{street reporter}
<D>__{they're saying it was a brother, is that true?}
<A>__{lilly stares at the reporter, pauses for thought. she whistles to one of the cops nearby, who then approaches.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{arrest her.}
<A>__{jones and lilly push past as the reporter protests at being manhandled.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(continuing; to jones)}
<D>__{find any witnesses and shut them up.}
<A>__{jones nods and moves over to a policeman guarding the alley. lilly ducks under the crime scene tape, moving into the alley.}
