<L>__{interior master bedroom day}
<A>__{meg stands just outside the door to the panic room, regaining her composure. not crazy about tight spaces. which we already knew.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{that door is a safely hazard.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{not at all.}
<A>__{he points. there's a tiny red beam that shines across the doorway, one at shoulder height }
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{infrared. like the beam in an elevator doorway. won't let the door close if something's blocking it.}
<A>__{ and one at shin height. even bend down, blocks the one at shin height with his hand.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{watch.}
<A>__{he reaches up, to push the close button, but with one hand anchored at the floor, he can't quite reach it.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(to lydia)}
<D>__{push that button for me, will you?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{don't!}
<A>__{lydia pushes the close button, nothing happens. evan pulls his hand put of the beam, takes a step back. lydia pushes the button again. whang! the metal door rockets shut, the metallic slang reverberating in the room. almost immediately, the fake piece of wall hums shut, of its own accord, followed a moment later by the mirror, which detaches itself from the back of the closet door and hums silently back into place, closing over the hidden door, making the corner of the room look like a corner again. as the mirrored door closes, it shows meg her own reflection. she looks at herself, still rattled. she wipes a trickle of sweat from the side of her face.}
