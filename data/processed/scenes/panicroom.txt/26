<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{ 2:26. meg is in a hard, boozy sleep. we drift out the door of the master bedroom, into the third floor hallway, and down the open stairwell. we glide through the entry floor, still gently falling through the stairwell's airway, dropping even further, all the way down to the kitchen floor, the ground floor. we drift across the darkened kitchen, serpentine through the canyon of moving boxes, approach the window that looks out on the street. we move right up against the window, peer through the glass just as a van pulls up across the street and stops. can't see through its windows. no movement for a moment, then the driver's door opens and a man climbs out. he wears dark clothes. the man closes the door, looks both ways, and starts across the street towards us. he's carrying a bag of some kind. he goes to the door, and we drift down toward the doorknob. we hear a key slide into the door, rattle. but the lock doesn't turn. the key slides out, back in again, jiggles. still won't open the door. the man steps away from the door, goes to the kitchen window, which is heavily barred, and peers inside, right at us. can't see anything, it's darker in here than it is out there. he turns, looks both ways on the street again, then steps up, onto the window ledge. now we can only see his legs, can't tell what he's doing. he's reaching up, stretching for something. it drops into view with a metallic scrape. the fire escape. the man climbs, his feet disappearing from our field of vision. we turn around, facing the other way in the kitchen. we start back the way we came, through the canyon of boxes in the kitchen, toward the stairwell.}
