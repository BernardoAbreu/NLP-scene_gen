<B>__{this convalescence hospital has been fashioned from a long row of}
<A>__{bathing cabins on the coast, complete with campari umbrellas and metal tables, at which are seated the bandaged and the dying and the comatose, staring out to sea or in slow, muted conversation. hana walks up to the patient's cabin. he is propped up with a view of the sea, which is interrupted by the pacing officer. hana has a blanket and a chart for the patient's bed. she busies herself.}
