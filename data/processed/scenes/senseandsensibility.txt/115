<D>__{poor miss marianne looked very badly t'other day. when i think of her, deserted and abandoned, it frightens me to think i shall never marry.}

<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{there are qualities which will always make up for that, and you have them in abundance. it would not surprise me if you were to marry far and away beyond your expectations.}

<D>__{tush! they will allow it as soon as they see you, my dear.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{it is a very great secret. i have told no one in the world for fear of discovery.}
