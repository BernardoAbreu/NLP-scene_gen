<D>__{you're working for the wrong man.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you're working for the wrong man.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{oh on the contrary you are working for the wrong man. you've got something the other guys don't have.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{yeah, what is it exactly? charm isn't the right word. it's more than that. you exude something. you draw people in. all the reporters love you. even the ones that hate you love you. you play them all like they're pieces on a chess board. and you make it look effortless. we both know how much work it takes, constantly being on guard, weighing every word so carefully, every move. but from the outside, you make it look easy.}
<C>__{duffy }
<D>__{people are scared of you because they don't understand how you do it, and they love you for it. there's nothing more valuable in this business the ability to win people's respect by making them mistake their fear for love. you can guess what i'm gonna say nexterior}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{no...i don't think i can.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{i want you to work for us.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you gotta be kidding me.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{not in the least.}
<A>__{beat.}
<D>__{you are going to lose ohio.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i am not.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{you're sitting on about a six percent lead in both polls...six percent of the democrats polled.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{eight.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{six...but that doesn't matter...independents and republicans can vote for the democratic candidate.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you think they like your guy?...pro choice...tax and spend liberal?}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{fuck no they hate him...they think they can beat my guy...but they're worried about yours...so starting tomorrow morning you're gonna see a fucking blitz...rush limbaugh, sean hannity, all the right wing blogs are gonna start a "get out the vote campaign"...it's already started...every fucking conservative in ohio is gonna stand in line and punch my guys ticket...that's just one of the steps...ohio is gone...the polls don't mean shit...tomorrow morning everyone will know...that's why i want you to handle the fallout we'll take in the press...}
<A>__{they look at each other.}
<C>__{duffy }
<D>__{and by the way...we've got thompson in the bag.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i know for a fact that thompson is going with us.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{we promised him secretary of state, ohio is over...it's been over for weeks...and with thompson's delegates...i'm thinking down the road now...that's why i want you...i will bring you in straight at the top.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i can't do it.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{i'm not asking for an answer right this moment.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i've played dirty but i don't have to play dirty anymore...you know why? cause i got morris!}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{none of this is about the democratic process steve, it's about getting your guy into office. simple as that.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{this is the sort of shit the republicans pull.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{you're right, this is exactly what the republicans do, and it's about time we learned from them. they're meaner, tougher and more disciplined than we are. i've been in this business for twenty five years and i've seen way too many democrats bite the dust because they wouldn't get down in the mud with the fucking elephants.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{paul's a friend.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{do you want to work for a friend or do you want to work for the president? think about it...you have my number.}
<A>__{duffy gets up and leaves.}
