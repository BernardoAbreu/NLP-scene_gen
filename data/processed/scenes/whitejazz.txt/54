<L>__{exterior hollywood and vine continuous}
<A>__{haul ass up to hollywood, round it: see tommy and wenzel sitting upright, the deuce spun sidelong, firing m3 `grease guns' into the approaching prowlers. both cars go helter skelter under fire. six packs spill to the street, belly crawl, brandish .38 service snubs and pop flimsy return fire. tommy jumps down, runs, rifling his jacket for clips. wenzel stays atop the car gun my engine, split the abandoned prowlers. wenzel looks up mid reload as i t bone the `deuce' at speed. the impact rockets him rag doll end over end before he bombs back down to the street, wet sack, multiple bruises fractures breaks...blood pooling in pints. tommy wide eyes the heap that was wenzel. kick my driver's side door open firing. tommy cuts loose with that grease gun, sprays wild. crouch move as bullets thump wreckage and whiz by overhead. more sirens approach. tuck behind the front end of the mangled `deuce.' another salvo from the grease gun skips up off the pavement in front of me. the six packs have regrouped, start laying down fire on tommy. tommy running now i'm up on one knee, aiming, tucking into the .45: take his legs but don't kill h that gray packard materializes across the intersection in front of tommy: shotgun blasts from the driver's side backseat obliterates tommy's mid section. my mouth gapes at what just happened...then i remember to fire at the packard as it continues down the street, running lights extinguished, no plates visible. get to tommy. crying. fading. roll him on his back.}

<D>__{where's your father!? did wilhite kill him!? tell me!}
<A>__{ bubbling blood in place of words. mouth moves like a grouper's...get close...his last gasp...pray it's profound. he breathes out...nothing.}
