<L>__{interior front desk dusk falls}
<A>__{just as ted is recovering from the mystery of this first guest, elspeth arrives. she has skin like marble, the body of venus, piercing blue eyes, blond hair and is dressed all in black clothing, like honey west in a rubber dress. she carries several bags, and a silver sword on her shoulder.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{may i help you?}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{i... we... have a reservation.}
<A>__{then she snaps, irritated, behind her.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{kiva!}
<A>__{angle on a young punk rocker chick with long orange hair, a long leather coat, wearing a tight t shirt with studs spelling "pussy" across her breasts. this is kiva. kiva is kicking the tar and nicotine outta the cigarette machine. just as ted's eyes grow wide with anxiety, several packs of smokes drop into the juvenile delinquent's hands.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{wait up, gawd! i had to get supplies for this boring ass night.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{we have a reservation in the honeymoon suite.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{oh yeah... you must be one of "the others." and what're you carrying the rock of gibraltar?}
<A>__{she stares at him without humor. he fumbles for the key. he walks around the desk to help her with her black crocodile luggage. jars clang inside. he is ready to go, but elspeth turns to lecture kiva on the hazards of smoking, as kiva lights up.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{what'd i tell you about smoking?}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{you smoke.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{that's right i smoke, and i'm addicted to it, and i don't want the same thing to happen to you.}
<C>__{kiva}
<P>__{(in game show host voice)}
<D>__{"hello welcome to this week's edition of the hypocrite of the year award "}
<A>__{as kiva goes off on her impression of a game show host, elspeth is growing increasingly rageful, like a mother with an unruly child. ted waits, luggage in hand.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{kiva! that's enough }
<A>__{she cuts kiva's ramble off. kiva blows smoke defiantly.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{you're not my mother!}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{yes i am.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{then why're we sleeping together?}
<A>__{ted looks on uneasily at the relationship that is beginning to unfold here. elspeth checks his reaction and becomes self conscious at his scrutiny.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{well... i didn't mean it... literally. i... i happen to be the only one who... cares about you }
<A>__{but her wild child looks off, bored. elspeth turns to ted, flustered.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{please take us to our room!}
<A>__{ted smiles uneasily and reaches to relieve her of her sword, but elspeth quickly slams her palm on the sword and shoots him a piercing glare. he jumps back with a light nervous laugh. he leads the way to the elevator.}
<B>__{at the honeymoon suite door}
<A>__{the couch has been set out here in the hall, as well as coffee tables, lamps, and the tv. elspeth and kiva enter the room. athena is gone. as ted stumbles around the furniture in the hall, he peers in the room and see a transformation. with most of the furniture removed, candles and incense and flowers are beginning to form an altar around the fireplace. but oddest of all is the pink tinged water swirling in the jacuzzi and pouring from the cupid urns. a sprinkle of white powder on the carpet encircles the hot tub. elspeth hands him a tip as he gawks at the circle.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{flea powder. one of the others is bringing her cat.}
<A>__{ted starts away again, perplexed. he turns for one last look to see elspeth kneeling before kiva, who sprawls on the floor. he shakes his head and leaves.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{you're gonna have to wait in the other room.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{because i said so.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{i will watch tv.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{you can't watch tv because the noise will interfere with our ritual.}
<A>__{kiva looks around the room and spies the tv in the hallway. she turns to elspeth with sarcastic concession.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{okay... mommy.}
<A>__{elspeth bristles as the brat saunters off to the bedroom. elspeth enters the sacred circle, stands before the altar, whips out her sword, and makes a ceremonial gesture pointing the sword upward, perfectly centered between her breasts. kiva, behind elspeth's back, exits from the bedroom doorway into the hall and comes back in, lugging the tv into the honeymoon bedroom. elspeth kneels before the altar. athena enters the room with the "cleansed" artifact and lays the slab in the center of the altar upon the heart shaped pillows as elspeth lays her sword next to the rock. the women look upon the union with tender affection.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{soon our goddess will come. i will go get her negligee.}
<A>__{athena stands up but her reverie is dispelled as she shrieks! loud tv suddenly blasts from the bedroom and kiva the brat is trying on the pink negligee over her clothes. athena takes the negligee off the irrepressible youth.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{what are you doing! have you no respect who who is dis girl?}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{kiva. my friend. kiva, turn off the tv! i can't leave her at home she's on probation and i gotta keep an eye on her.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{well, elspeth, your friend cannot stay here during the ritual. she may be one of your kind, but she is not one of us.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{she stays!! or i go along with my offering!}
<A>__{the women have a stare down. then athena calls out }
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{turn of the fucking tv, man!}
<C>__{kiva}
<P>__{(in a seductive pout)}
<D>__{make me...}
<A>__{elspeth becomes anxious with jealousy. athena is exasperated as she firmly demands from elspeth }
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{let's not forget i am the high fucking priestess. deal with dis girl!}
<A>__{elspeth defers to athena with remembered reverence and respect. she bows apologetic and scurries to the bedroom.}
<C>__{athena}
<P>__{(eyes lifted to heaven, wearily)}
<D>__{tell me did we have these problems in salem? i don't think so...}
<B>__{in the bedroom}
<A>__{elspeth swallows her rage and approaches the brat with a soft touch.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{kiva... you know what i love about you?}
<A>__{kiva smirks... yeah, she knows.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{your sweet side.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{and what do i get if i'm sweet?}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{you get whatever you want. and you know what else i love about you?}
<C>__{kiva}
<P>__{(seduced now)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{your nose.}
<A>__{and saying this, she kisses kiva's nose and leaves the room. kiva is quieted now. as elspeth closes the bedroom door, she has the last word.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{and i saw you checking her out.}
<A>__{kiva slinks back on the bed, put in her place for now. in the hallway exterior elevator dusk the doors open and ted pushes a cart of expensive designer luggage and lots of it behind yet another gorgeous gal. this one is jezebel, a southern beauty, fawning over her cat, as she carries nothing else, and proceeds down the hall like a southern princess.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<P>__{(talking to her cat in baby talk)}
<D>__{oh you little stinker... oh you sweet little muffin. yes... mama loves the baby.}
<B>__{at the door}
<A>__{jezebel bursts in, chattering.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{well, this is just darlin'! just darlin' hi dee, girls...}
<A>__{ted carries all her bags inside awkwardly. again, the place has become all the more transformed with wild canopies of exotic cloths and fixings. elspeth and athena are hard at work on a strange nature sculpture as jezebel enters. she stands inside the powdered circle and before the hot tub, which now has dark blue water swirling inside. she presents her cat upward toward heaven frees the cat, bares her breasts and sucks in the vibes: "ahhhh." ted settles the bags down, hoping for a peek at her charms, but her back is to him. the kitty rubs on her leg. she picks it up and presses it against her bare breasts, petting it sweetly. she winks and hands him a tip.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{toodle loo.}
<A>__{and saying this, she shoos him away. through the glass doors to the bedroom, she sees kiva sprawled on the bed, writing on herself.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{well i see elspeth has herself a new lil' fool what the hell is she doin' here on our night of annual ritual?}
<C>__{athena}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{i have sanctioned her presence, as long as she behaves. come on there is more work to be done to welcome our great diana.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{i want room service!!}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{why do i always attract girls who are looking for a babysitter?}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{well now, honey, maybe juvenile hall ain't the best place to find serious relationship material.}
<A>__{elspeth seethes at her. jezebel acts blithely innocent.}
<B>__{in the hallway}
<A>__{ted is walking from the room with the cart. his face is etched in a mask of perpetual frown as he looks at the tip in his hand at least these lunachicks tip well. waking him out of his deep mood is raven. another female intoxication, she wears a short skirt, all done up in native american, southwestern themes. no shoes. but she carries a small, old handmade broom. she moves down the hall, blissed out. ted makes eye contact, despite himself.}
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{i'm looking for the room for making love.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you might be referring to the honeymoon suite. straight thata way... you can't miss it see all that furniture in the hallway }
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{oh i know the way. i just wanted you to know that i knew where i was going and that you needn't bother yourself with me. the others are here great!}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{oh yeah it's so great it's fantastic.}
<C>__{raven}
<P>__{(in deep empathy)}
<D>__{ohhh... i know it all seems very strange but you're coping with us much better than the bellboys of past new year's.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{past new year's?}
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{oh yes we've been coming here every new year... for a long time. thanks for your patience.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{oh hey no problem wreck the place. bring in cats. ruin the carpet with flea powder, pour paint in the jacuzzi. throw the furniture out the... where're your bags?}
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{i travel very light.}
<A>__{ted looks down at the broom at her side, her bare feets, her thick dark hair. it keeps getting weirder. she wanders off.}
