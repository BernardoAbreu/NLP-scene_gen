<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{morning after?}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{after a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. sometimes i feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... but the thing i'm proud of is i been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... that's rare.}
