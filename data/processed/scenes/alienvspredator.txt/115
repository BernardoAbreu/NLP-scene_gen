<L>__{interior pyramid alien queen's chamber}
<A>__{the alien queen hangs from her chains, a prisoner. slowly, dark figures emerge from the shadows of the chamber. aliens, her children. led by grid. they almost seem to bow in supplication to the alien queen.}
<L>__{interior pyramid sacrificial chamber}
<A>__{predator and human run side by side. scar is clearly starting to accept lex as something of an equal. lex slows and then halts. something on the ground catches lex's eyes. it's miller's camera and it's laying on the ground, covered in blood. lex kneels to pick the camera up. she holds it in her hands, slowly wiping the blood away. lex flips through a few of the digital photos that miller has taken on this trip. the last photo lex stares at is the one that he showed her on the helicopter: miller standing arm in arm with his two sons.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{miller!}
<A>__{but there is no reply.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{miller!}
<A>__{lex stands and stares into the darkness. she shines her flashlight, piercing the darkness to find in horror the three cocoons that hold the dead bodies of miller, verheiden and connors. what's left of their rib cages are already bent outward. the chest bursters long gone. verheiden's, miller's and connors' faces are all frozen in a grotesque rictus. lex mourns and kneels down by their bodies and finds miller's handgun. she studies the gun as she hears something. it's very fainterior a ghostly echo. at first, she can't make it out. but then, to her horror, lex realizes what it is her name. repeated over and over.}
<C>__{echoing voice}
<D>__{lex...}
<A>__{it is coming from a cluster of stone statues close by.}
<C>__{echoing voice }
<D>__{lex...}
<A>__{lex advances on the statues. eyes straining to see in the half light of the chamber.}
<C>__{echoing voice }
<D>__{... help me ...}
<A>__{up ahead there is one statue in particular. some kind of grotesque beast. it seems impossible, but the voice seems to be coming from this statue.}
<C>__{echoing voice }
<D>__{... help me, lex ...}
<A>__{lex draws closer, and only now does the horrific truth become clear. what lex thought was a statue is alive. and what she thought was a beast, is a man sebastian. the alien had not killed him, but instead, encased him in some kind of monstrous alien cocoon.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{sebastian!}
<A>__{sebastian is held tight in the cocoon. in front of him an empty alien egg. he's clearly in a lot of pain.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{i will get you out of here.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{no! lex, it's too late. you have to stop these things!}
<A>__{sebastian screams in agony.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{lex... they... can't... reach... the surface.}
<A>__{lex nods slowly.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{his skin is starting to stretch tight. an alien chest burster is about to break free. without hesitation, scar targets his weapon. the three red dots of the laser sighting system appear on sebastian.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she blocks scar's shot.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{no ...}
<A>__{behind her, sebastian screams again. lex turns to face him, tears in her eyes. she brings up miller's handgun.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{do it.}
<A>__{she can see it in his eyes death would be a mercy.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{lex closes her eyes and makes the impossible and unthinkable choice to fire. her gun racks back as she just fired the last bullet. and we hold on her eyes, experiencing the horror of this moment entirely from her tortured perspective. sebastian's agonized screaming comes to an abrupt end. scar watches her closely. from his reaction, he appears to respect her more and more with every decision she makes. scar's predator vision: we see sebastian's dead body slumped on the floor. his body begins to convulse. sebastian's skin begins to distend. the alien chest burster leaps through the air. with lightening fast reflexes, scar catches it. close on scar as he holds the newly born alien up to his face. he turns it in his hand, examining it. close on the alien. its teeth snapping at scar's face. unbelievably vicious. then in one simple move, scar casually snaps its neck between his fingers. just like it were a matchstick.}
