<D>__{i got half a mind to come out there and teach you sonofabitch }
<A>__{shotgun punk fires without warning point blank into the counter display and the man! the counter man is blown backwards cabinets crash; he crumples, groaning and bloody onto the floor!}
<C>__{shotgun punk}
<D>__{now you got half a mind, old man.}
<A>__{punk #2 scoops up the money. the three punks saunter up and surround storm. storm looks down at their feet, then to their faces and smiles. shotgun punk points the gun at storm's face.}
<C>__{shotgun punk}
<D>__{what are you grinning at, pindejo?}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{we ... ell ... there's only three of you and you only got one shot left.}
<A>__{the punks don't know whether to laugh or just shoot him, but it is too late for either option, as storm suddenly spins between the punks and behind the gun. the shotgun goes off and blows away part of the back wall bottles explode storm locks the punk's fingers into the gun, rotates the gun as a bar, breaking the punk's arm. the others make their move but now storm has the shotgun and is using it as a sword or staff. he looks like a true master conductor in an almost magical manipulation. these pour stupid punks have become the instruments in his spontaneous orchestra. punk #2 takes a vicious swipe at storm with his long knife. storm ducks, goes to his knees, and uses the gun to foot sweep the punk. the punk's legs fly skyward and his head slams against the floor. as soon as he hits, the shotgun is slammed through his teeth. the last punk has produced an icepick and is staring at his compadres in disbelief. he and storm square off.}
<C>__{storm}
<P>__{(to punk, calmly)}
<D>__{i know what you're thinking. i have this big shotgun and all you have is that little icepick. mine's bigger than yours. it's not fair.}
<A>__{storm sets the gun down. punk #3 is still frozen.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{still not fair?}
<A>__{storm gets down on his knees.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{don't wait for the blindfold, maricon. punk #3}
<P>__{(clutching the ice pick tightly)}
<D>__{chinga tu madre!}
<A>__{the punk lungs, thrusting the ice pick with lightning speed at storm's face. storm makes a slight movement, parries the thrust and slides his body behind the punk, simultaneously slamming his forearm into the rear knee jointerior the punk buckles and storm now has one of his legs in both arms and pins the other leg with his left knee. we see the leg held in storm's arms begin to twist ... and with a blood curdling scream we hear a loud snap. sirens are heard approaching outside.}
