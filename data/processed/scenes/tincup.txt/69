<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior cottonwood local qualifier tenth tee day}
<A>__{tin cup's in a zone, talking to himself, full of himself, in a fabulous, indomitable state of mind. molly and romeo keep looking at each other and shrugging, tin cup's on a roll and needs no help. so far... a couple of the regulars shout out encouragement.}
<D>__{clint earl you the man, tin cup! you the man!}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{they bugging you, boss i can shut 'em up?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{the way i'm swinging today, nothing bugs me except insufficient applause.}
<P>__{(surveying the fairway)}
<D>__{gimme the lumber.}
<A>__{but romeo is handing him a two iron.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{i think two iron's safer.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i said i want the big dog.}
<A>__{romeo looks warily down the fairway of a tight dogleg left par five.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{tight par five, out of bounds left... you don't want to hit driver.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i'm not going left of those trees. i'm going over those trees... with a little draw. that way i get home in two. that way i'm putting for eagle.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you don't need eagle to qualify! you need to get used to playing smart no mistakes wins the open.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{qualify? i want the course record! now gimme the lumber!}
<A>__{tin cup reaches for the driver. romeo shifts the golf bag beyond tin cup's reach.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you not going to listen to me? you don't care i'm trying to help? you think i'm full of shit?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i think i'm gonna get penalized for slow play if you don't give me that fucking driver.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you a head case, boss, always were, always will be.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{then let's ask the head doctor. dr. griswold?}
<P>__{(to molly)}
<D>__{dr. griswold, should i hit the big dog or the two?}
<A>__{suddenly an official steps forward.}
<C>__{p.g.a. official}
<D>__{soliciting shot selection advice is a two stroke penalty.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{trust your feelings, roy.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<P>__{(to romeo)}
<D>__{ha! gimme the driver and shut up.}
<A>__{romeo pulls out the driver and he snaps it in half over his knee. he tosses the two halves on the ground near tin cup.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{... go ahead. hit the driver.}
<A>__{tin cup looks at the two halves of his driver, curbing his anger, not giving romeo the satisfaction of a reaction.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i changed my mind. gimme the three wood.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you can't clear the dogleg with a three wood.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{wanna bet?}
<A>__{romeo pulls out the three wood, snaps it over his knee, and tosses the halves on the ground next to the driver halves. tin cup turns with amusement to his playing partners, lest they think management has lost the upper hand with labor.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{guess i'm going with the safe shot, boys.}
<A>__{tin cup reaches for the two iron, studies it a moment, frowns, and then: he snaps it over his knee. he dumps these halves on the ground with the halves of the driver and three wood. romeo stares, aghast. tin cup merely shrugs.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{sometimes i fan that two iron. better gimme the three.}
<A>__{romeo warily hands tin cup the three iron. tin cup looks at it, frowns, then: he snaps it over his knee and tosses it on the ground. molly leans over to the regulars.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{is this normal behavior for him?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{the word 'normal' and him don't collide in the same sentence too often.}
<A>__{she watches in amazement as }
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{sometimes i catch that three a little thin...}
<A>__{he drops the three iron halves with the other halves, and steps past romeo and sequentially yanks all but the seven iron from his bag. he snaps them over his knee, one by one, citing the crimes of each club with mounting absurdity and ire.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{and i've hooked my four iron...}
<P>__{(snap)}
<D>__{... and hit flyers with the five...}
<P>__{(snap)}
<D>__{... and shanked the six...}
<P>__{(snap)}
<D>__{... and skulled the eight...}
<P>__{(snap)}
<D>__{... and fatted the nine...}
<P>__{(snap)}
<D>__{... and chili dipped the wedge...}
<P>__{(snap)}
<D>__{... and bladed the sand wedge...}
<P>__{(snap; then pauses}
<D>__{to reflect contemptuously}
<P>__{on his putter)}
<D>__{... and then there's mister three putt...}
<A>__{he snaps the putter in half and dumps it in the pile of broken clubs at his feet. then, he reaches for the last club in his bag, the seven iron. the regulars hold their breath, thinking this is the end of tin cup's open bid. but... tin cup smiles and caresses the seven iron affectionately.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{but the seven iron, i never miss the seven iron. it's the only truly safe club in my bag.}
<A>__{he moves to the tee, drops a ball, and hits it down the middle with the seven iron.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{you happy, romeo?}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{no, boss, i'm tired... my life's too short to spend it watching you fall apart. i done it too many times.}
<A>__{romeo turns and starts walking away.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{what's this? you're quitting? first sign of adversity, you're quitting?}
<P>__{(as romeo continues)}
<D>__{anyone want to bet me i can't par in with a seven iron?}
<P>__{(to molly)}
<D>__{doc? take the bet?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{roy just shut up and hit the ball.}
