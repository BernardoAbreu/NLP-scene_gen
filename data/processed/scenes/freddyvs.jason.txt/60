<L>__{interior abandoned boiler room moments later}
<A>__{erwin leads meagan, jesse and stormie down into the old, burnt out boiler room. they work their way towards the back, to a large table and a collection of sofas and easy chair scattered about. erwin starts sniffing around, pointing out several used syringes laying scattered about the floor.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{damn! we must have just missed them!}
<A>__{meagan spots lizzy's shirt sleeve on the floor.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{oh, my god she was here! this is part of lizzy's shirt! it's all torn!}
<P>__{(grabs erwin)}
<D>__{erwin... we've got to find her!}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{we're too late! there's no way... except...}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{except what?!}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{we could go after freddy.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{erwin goes to a boiler, bends down and reaches way up underneath. after fishing around for a moment, he draws out a well worn mutant ninja turtles lunch box. inside a vile of liquid, several syringes, and several pairs of cult shades.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{we'll inject ourselves with dream dope. it's a mild narcotic that brings on a dreamlike state.}
<A>__{meagan thinks about this for a moment, then nods her approval.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{okay... let's do it!}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{meagan... we don't do drugs! i mean, what if one of us gets hooked or something?}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{we could turn out like him!}
<A>__{jesse jerks a thumb toward erwin.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{don't worry about it. we need you wide awake anyway.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{we're going to go under and try to find freddy. when we do, we'll grab him and bring him here. then you kill him with this...}
<A>__{erwin hands jesse an old rusty revolver.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{this rusty chunk of shit? what good is this?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{it's not the gun, it's what's in it silver bullets blessed by a priest.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{will that work?}
<C>__{erwin}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{should. but then...}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(finishes for him)}
<D>__{you don't make the rules... yeah, yeah.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{what should we do?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{have a seat over there and make yourselves comfortable. roll up your sleeves and put these on...}
<A>__{erwin hands meagan and stormie each a pair of the sunglasses with flashing red diodes in each lens. stormie puts hers on immediately and says:}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{oh, cool!}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{what are they for?}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{it's how the cult keeps in constant contact with freddy. the little lights flashing are a sustained occular input that causes your brain to resonate at approximately the same frequency at which the dream state is most likely to occur.}
<A>__{all of this went over meagan's head. stormie shrugs:}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{whatever...}
<P>__{(to meagan; excited)}
<D>__{put 'em on they're really cool!}
<A>__{meagan and stormie sit down in easy chairs, rolling up their sleeves. erwin comes over and reclines the chairs, giving each girl an injection. then erwin takes a seat next to meagan and injects himself. he lets the syringe drop to the floor as he lowers his glasses.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{it helps to hold hands if you want to go together...}
<A>__{meagan clasps hands with erwin and stormie. jesse watches with skepticism and concern. erwin ushers a final warning:}
<C>__{erwin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and remember... freddy knows what scares you.}
<A>__{then all three fall through their chairs into...}
