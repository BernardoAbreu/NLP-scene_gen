<A>__{the crowd cheers and the band plays as a parade of matadors, picadors and banderilleros enters the ring. led by their guide, pedro, the group takes seats in the front row, back of the trenches. they have to sit close down so nikki can see things. the drunken old man from the bar tags along behind bill like a puppy dog and tries to sit next to him but pedro pointedly directs him to a seat in the second row. when bill rises to cheer the parade, the drunken old man also rises and taps him affectionately on the shoulder. bill turns and greets him pleasantly, shaking his hand.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well! my old pal!}
<A>__{the old man tips his hat to bill and sits. bill shakes his pant leg and gives the old man a wry look before also sitting.}
<B>__{in the ring}
<A>__{the parade ends. a matador throws his montera (his black woolen hat) into the crowd.}
<B>__{in the front row}
<A>__{cary catches the hat, much to the group's delight they shout "hooray!" immediately, a cape is hurled at bill who drapes it over the railing before them. cary offers the hat to nikki.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{nikki, here's a present for you.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, a hat!}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{oh, senor, no, no, no you must not keep the hat. you must put a little present in it and return it to the matador after the fight.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{what kind of present?}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{well, eh a little jewelry. something you have like the chain or the watch or the the the cigarette case or the cuff links or or the }

<D>__{look! here he comes!}
<B>__{in the ring}
<A>__{a bull charges into view. bull fighter and bull face off. the bull makes ten passes, faster and closer each time.}

<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{nice work! good work.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what's so good about it?}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{he works close to the bull.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{is that so dangerous?}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{sure, it's dangerous. bull fighting is very dangerous. it takes a lot of courage to go into the bull ring.}
<A>__{bill scoffs and waves dismissively. cary leans in with a query.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{is it true the bull is blind when he charges?}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{he sees only the cape perhaps.}
<B>__{in the ring}
<A>__{bull fighter and bull continue their duel. finally, the bull gets the advantage and others must rush in to distract the bull.}
<B>__{in the front row}
<A>__{bill is unimpressed.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{bet i could run that bull bow legged. you know, i should have been a bull fighter.}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{you should have started at twelve years of old.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i bet i could start right now.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(puts a hand on bill's shoulder)}
<D>__{sit still and behave yourself.}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{bull fighting is not for americans.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you think we haven't got the nerve or something?}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{why, listen, bull fighting is just for us, the latins.}
<C>__{bill}

<A>__{full of himself, bill nods.}
<C>__{pedro}
<P>__{(turns away; flatly)}
<D>__{is not the same!}
<A>__{everyone suddenly stares in shock as:}
<B>__{in the ring}
<A>__{the bull knocks down the matador. others rush in to distract the bull which runs wild, out of control.}
<B>__{in the front row}
<A>__{frink nudges francis awake and points out the carnage in the ring. francis glances at the spectacle briefly and then sleepily applauds. frink gives him a look and nudges him to stop clapping. francis simply goes back to sleep.}
<B>__{wild bull montage}
<A>__{the toreros try to control the bull but it refuses to cooperate. the crowd watches intently. bill takes off his own hat and picks up the matador's cap that cary had caught. toreros scramble and run for their lives. the bull chases them down, runs across the ring, forcing them to jump the barrera, the protective wooden barrier that circles the inside of the arena. bill, now wearing the cap, can't resist leaning over and mocking a group of toreros who huddle in the callejon, the safe side of the barrier, just below him.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{nice work, tony! nice work, joe!}
<A>__{the toreros look up at bill in surprise. one of them responds in portuguese with a gesture toward the ring, as if to ask "if it's so easy, why don't you try it?" the other toreros laugh. bill stares into the ring, a savage look in his eyes. he puts a leg up on the railing. he jumps down into the ring.}
<C>__{cary's voice}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{cary rises, stunned.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{bill! come back here!}
<A>__{but it is too late. bill's coat is already off and he waves it like a cape as he stalks after the bull. the bull turns and sees him. bill moves toward it, waving his coat and grinning like a madman. shep is frozen. beside him, nikki screams and turns away. the bull begins to charge. cary climbs over the railing. the bull charges. track fast toward bill who holds the coat before him big eyes, big grin. the bull is on him. the bull roars. bill's face snaps backward in a blur, his coat follows. the bull gores him through his coat. his face twists in pain.}
