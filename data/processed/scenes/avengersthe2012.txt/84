<A>__{hill is watching loki on a screen too.}
<D>__{...warm light for all mankind to share?}
<L>__{interior cylindrical glass cage, carrier continuous (night)}
<A>__{loki faces fury again.}
<D>__{and then to be reminded what real power is.}
<A>__{fury smiles.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{well, let me know if ’real power’ wants a magazine or something.}
<A>__{fury exits.}

<A>__{the monitor on cap’s side of the table turns off. steve, in suit with no cowl, looks up.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{he really grows on you doesn’t he?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{loki’s gonna drag this out. so, thor, what’s his play?}
<C>__{thor}
<D>__{he has an army called the chitauri. they’re not of asgard nor any world known. he means to lead the against your people. they will win him the earth, in return, i suspect, for the tesseract.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{an army, from outer space?}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{so, he’s building another portal. that’s what he needs erik selvig for.}
<C>__{thor}
<D>__{selvig?}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{he’s an astrophysicist.}
<C>__{thor}
<D>__{he’s a friend.}
<C>__{natasha}
<D>__{loki has them under some kind of spell along with one of ours.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i wanna know why loki let us take him. he’s not leading an army from here.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{i don’t think we should be focusing on loki. that guy’s brain is a bag full of cats, you can small crazy on him.}
<C>__{thor}
<D>__{have care how you speak. loki is beyond reason but he is of asgard, and he is my brother.}
<C>__{natasha}
<D>__{he killed eighty people in two days.}
<C>__{thor}
<D>__{he’s adopted?}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{i think it’s about the mechanics. iridium, what do they need the iridium for?}
<A>__{tony and coulson come walking in.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{it’s a stabilizing agent.}
<P>__{(to coulson, quietly)}
<D>__{i’m saying, take a weekend; i’ll fly you to portland. keep love alive.}
<A>__{coulson peels off from tony, who is heading over to thor.}
<D>__{means the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at shield.}
<P>__{(to thor)}
<D>__{no hard feelings point break, you got a mean swing.}
<A>__{thor gives tony a look as he walks to the control panels.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{also, means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as loki wants.}
<P>__{(to shield personnel)}
<D>__{ah, raise the mizzen mast, ship the topsails.}
<A>__{the personnel look at him strangely.}
<D>__{that man is playing galaga! thought we wouldn’t notice, but we did.}
<A>__{standing now at the command area of the ship, tony covers one eye.}
<P>__{(to hill)}
<D>__{how does fury even see these?}
<C>__{maria hill}
<P>__{(attitude)}
<D>__{he turns!}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{sounds exhausting!}
<A>__{he begins messing with the screens, sticking something to the underside of a desk.}
<D>__{the rest of the raw materials, agent barton can get his hands on pretty easily. only major component he still needs is a power source of high energy density. something to kick start the cube.}
<C>__{maria hill}
<D>__{when did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{last night. the packet, selvig’s notes, the extraction theory papers am i the only one who did the reading?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{does loki need any particular kind of power source?}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{he’s have to heat the cube to a hundred and twenty million kelvin just to break through the coulomb barrier.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{unless, selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{well, if he could do that he could achieve heavy ion fusion at any reactor on the planet.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{finally. someone who speaks english.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{is that what just happened?}
<A>__{stark and banner shake hands.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{it’s good to meet you, doctor banner. your work on anti electronic collisions is unparalleled. and i’m a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{...thanks.}
<A>__{fury enters.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{doctor banner is only here to track the cube. i was hoping you might join him.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i’d start with that stick of his. it may be magical but it works an awful lot like a hydra weapon.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{i don’t know about that, but it is powered by the cube. and i like to know how loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men i know into his personal flying monkeys.}
<C>__{thor}
<D>__{monkeys? i do not understand }
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i do!}
<A>__{the entire room goes instantly silent, staring at steve.}
<P>__{steve (cont’d)}
<D>__{i...i understood that reference.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{shall we play, doctor?}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{this way, sir.}
<A>__{the two men walk off. on a shield worker: he resumes play galaga again.}
