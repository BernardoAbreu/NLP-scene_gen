<A>__{it's bright sunshine. fletcher is splashing noisily in the pool with a few other kids. his nanny waits patiently at the side, towels at the ready. at one side of the pool, rachel sits, lost in thought, mourning her sister. at the other side sits frank, also thoughtful. he, too, is trying to adjust to the tragedy for which he bears some of the responsibility. the shouts and laughter of the kids continue.}
