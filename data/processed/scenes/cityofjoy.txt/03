<L>__{exterior roadside bus stop day (dawn)}
<A>__{hasari's father passes a gourd of precious water. hasari serves the children first. shambu gulps entirely too much, the others forcing him to stop by a unified force of will. embarrassed, he passes the cup to his brother, who sips, as does his sister. aloka barely wets her lips, insisting on leaving the last drops for hasari. and now, a rooster tail of dust rises up behind the approaching bus and the old parents bid farewell to their son's family. there is an intense sadness at leaving the land and hasari's mother clings to him...}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i will send money soon.}
<A>__{his mother nods, as hasari erupts in a small cough which, by habit, he suppresses. his mother crushes aloka to her.}
<C>__{hasari's mother}
<D>__{don't let the children out of your sight. not for a moment.}
<A>__{now the children. she wants to keep them here even as the old man touches her, reminding her she must let them go.}
<C>__{hasari's mother}
<D>__{help your parents. don't fight with each other. and, manooj, stay away from the cinema, do you hear?}
<A>__{shambu, his eyes big as saucers, whispers to his grandma...}
<C>__{shambu}
<D>__{i don't want to go. there are bad men with long knives who steal children.}
<A>__{that does it: hasari's mother dissolves in tears, but the old man nevertheless unlooses her insistently from the children. aloka and the children get on the bus as the old man embraces his son.}
<C>__{hasari's father}
<D>__{a man's journey to the end of his obligations is a very long road. yours begins here.}
