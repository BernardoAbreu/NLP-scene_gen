<L>__{interior diner a short while later}
<A>__{it's quiet. drifting past sleeping figures to find charlie, wide awake, sitting at a booth, lost in thought.}
<C>__{jeep }
<D>__{guess it's your turn not to sleep.}
<A>__{charlie looks up to see jeep sit down across from her.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey...}
<A>__{jeep sees the strain on her face.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you mean besides the fact that i just found out that i'm the mother of the messiah?}
<A>__{jeep smiles, nods.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{crazy thing is...i didn't want this baby. i even went down to the clinic, you know that?}
<P>__{(off jeep's reaction:)}
<D>__{i remember sitting there in the waiting room, absolutely sure i was doin' the right thing...and that's when the feeling started. like i was falling into the deepest, darkest hole imaginable. i couldn't breathe, i couldn't speak. i kept thinking this must be what death is like. and when finally they called my name, i ran.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{for a while after that i tried pretending that it was just cold feet, that i could go back if i wanted to, that i could decide to end it like i'd planned. then i'd start to have that feeling again and i knew i didn't have a choice. somehow this had already been decided. and it made me hate this thing that's been growing inside me.}
<A>__{a long beat, as jeep considers her, then:}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{you shouldn't say things like that, charlie. it isn't right. you'll get through this. i know you will.}
<A>__{she turns to him, the bitterness overtaking her:}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{how come you have so much faith in me, jeep? god knows i've never given you or anybody else a reason to. or is it that you just can't find any other hard luck case to follow around?}
<A>__{jeep's face hardens. he gets up. hurt. frustrated.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{you know, you're not the only who's suffered, okay? let me know when you stop feeling sorry for yourself.}
<A>__{and with that, jeep walks away, leaving charlie to stare after him, disturbed and surprised by his response.}
