<L>__{interior drawing room, east wing, wayne manor continuous}
<A>__{close on the dinner tray. we hear a labored step approach. bruce wayne appears, leaning on a cane. gaunt. grey temples. he lifts the lid of his dinner, then freezes, hearing something. he slowly limps into the next room...}
<L>__{interior sitting room, east wing, wayne manor, continuous}
<A>__{the maid looks at framed photographs of rachel, thomas and martha wayne. some are half burned. she notices an archery target, arrows stuck in it. she reaches out. wham! an arrow sticks into the target the maid spins around, flustered. wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite bow. picks up his cane.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{i'm, i'm terribly sorry, mr. wayne. it is mr. wayne, isn't it?}
<A>__{wayne nods, gently. limps towards her.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{although you don't have the long nails... (nervous laugh.) or facial scars...}
<A>__{she trails off, embarrassed. coy. she seems very young.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{is that what they say about me?}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{it's just that...nobody sees you...}
<A>__{wayne approaches slowly. he nods at her pearl necklace.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{that's a beautiful necklace. reminds me of the one that belonged to my mother. it can't be the same one her pearls are in this safe }
<A>__{he reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the bureau, revealing a safe door...}
<D>__{ which the manufacturer clearly explained is uncrackable.}
<A>__{...which swings open with an awkward creak.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{oops. no one told me it was uncrackable.}
<A>__{the maid suddenly seems more confident. older.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i'm afraid i can't let you take those.}
<A>__{she smiles at him. moves towards him.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{look, you wouldn't hit a woman any more than i would beat up a cripple.}
<A>__{she kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down.}
<D>__{of course, sometimes exceptions have to be made.}
<A>__{the maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window.}
<D>__{goodnight, mr. wayne.}
<A>__{she flips backwards through the window. wayne smiles, then rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace. he looks at the safe, notices something. powder...}
