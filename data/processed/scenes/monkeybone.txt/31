<L>__{exterior coma bar streets night}
<A>__{the coma victims shuffle toward a big ride across the midway. it's a "test your strength" machine the kind where you slam down a mallet and try to ring the bell. it's surrounded by crocodile moats and storm fences and electrified barbed wire, and a big sign reading private no admittance. earl, still jubilant, inserts his e ticket into a receptacle at the entrance. a drawbridge lowers, and carousel music cranks up, and carnival lights blink on, and fireworks rocket into the sky... all around them, faces turn skyward. clouds are parting. an eddy of swirling colors is forming directly above the e ticket ride and a pinpoint hole opens up at its center. the "test your strength" machine has been outfitted with a seat where the bell ringer should be. once earl has settled in, a giant mechanical man lifts its enormous mallet... ...and slams it down on the lever end of the machine, sending earl rocketing upward toward the hole in the sky. ding!! the seat hits the bell, but earl keeps going up up up... then, with a distinct pop, he's gone. over the rainbow...home.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{he's ninety. he's practically dead already. how come he goes back and i stay here?}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(turning abruptly)}
<D>__{hey!! hey, you!!}
<A>__{stu marches across the street to the grim reaper who's climbing onto his winged bicycle and seems shocked that anyone would want to chat with him. monkeybone scurries alongside, terrified.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{he got an e ticket. where's mine? when do i get to wake up??}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{stu? stu? let's not disturb the nice reaper.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i've been stuck down here for months. somebody had better start paying attention, or i'm gonna i'm gonna kick ass!}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{let's not kick the nice reaper's ass.}
<A>__{monkeybone practically swoons. but the reaper just stares at stu:}
<C>__{reaper}
<D>__{sorry, bud. off duty.}
<A>__{the reaper climbs onto his winged bike and pedals off down the midway. stu lets out a howl of frustration.}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{stu? stu? let's calm down, talk things over. how about some comedy relief? okay. brontosaurus walks into a gay bar...}
<A>__{stu boots monkeybone aside. they're at a game stall manned by elsie the cow the one where you throw baseballs at milk bottles. stu picks up a baseball and hurls it at the departing reaper. the ball hits the reaper smack on the head, knocking him off his bike!}
<D>__{stu monkeybone}
<P>__{(in unison impressed)}
<D>__{damn.}
<A>__{monkeybone cowers in fear as the reaper gets up, shaking a fist at them. but stu isn't intimidated. he grabs another ball and winds up.}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{stu? stu? i think weve got this backwards. your behavior...is disturbing me.}
<A>__{the reaper, scared shitless, jumps back on his bike and pedals off as the ball whizzes past. stu starts chasing after him! the reaper turns down a side street and pedals up an incline one of the "fingers" of the hand that holds dark town. when the bike hits the end of the finger, it takes off into the void and keeps on going.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{that's right. run! and don't come back unless you've got my e ticket!!}
<A>__{the reaper vanishes. stu sits dejectedly on the edge of the curb.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{who am i kidding? i'm never gonna get out of here. i will never see her again.}
<A>__{just then, a multi armed messenger boy in royal livery toodles past on a child's scooter. he stops...}
<C>__{messenger boy}
<D>__{miley? stu miley?}
<A>__{stu looks up. six arms reach into six pockets. finally the messenger finds an envelope and hands it over. inside is an engraved invitation:}
<D>__{you are invited to a}
<C>__{pajama party}
<D>__{at hypnos' hideaway penthouse suite 10 pm sharp "if you snooze, you lose"}
<A>__{stu's eyes widen with excitement as the messenger scoots off.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{hypnos! the god of nightmares! do you know what this means, monkeybone? he's finally going to hear my case. i'm going home!}
