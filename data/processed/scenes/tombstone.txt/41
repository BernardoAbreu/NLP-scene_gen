<L>__{int wyatt's house night}
<A>__{mattie lies in bed, lost in an opium dream. she snaps out of it and sits up as wyatt enters and gives her a kiss, glancing at the half empty laudanum bottle on the nightstand.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{that the bottle lou gave you? better go easy on that stuff.}
<C>__{mattie}

<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{out ridin'. so... how you doin'?}
<C>__{mattie}

<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{really? you sure?}
<C>__{mattie}
<D>__{sure i'm sure. what is this?}
<A>__{wyatt sits down on the bed, suddenly intent, his face alight:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{well, i was thinking, we've already made a pile of money. maybe we should just pull up stakes and move on. and we could stay on the move, you know? just keep going, see the world. live on room service the rest of our lives. how'd that be?}
<C>__{mattie}
<D>__{wyatt, what're you talkin' about?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{just thinkin' out loud. forget it.}
