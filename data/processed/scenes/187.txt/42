<A>__{... trace the cold underbelly of the overpass. the glare of oncoming headlights flash overhead as we discover a tagging wall. closer now... ... the wall is completely covered with graffiti. the centerpiece of the wall is a 5' by 10' multi color "placa" that reads...}
<C>__{k.o.s.}
<A>__{angling to discover an anglo tagger now as he defaces the "s" in k o s, covering it with his own piece. suddenly the lone tagger feels a presence at his back. he freezes. now slowly turns to see... ... benny, cesar and paco. merely shadows. benny lights a blunt, illuminating his face. passes it to cesar...}
<C>__{tagger}
<D>__{do i know you?}
<C>__{benny}
<P>__{(indicates tagging)}
<D>__{you should. you're fuckin' with my piece, puto.}
<C>__{tagger}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{... you from k.o.s.? no shit?}
<A>__{cesar and paco burst into hysterical laughter which only manages to get benny piqued.}
<C>__{tagger}
<P>__{(panicking)}
<D>__{look, i didn't mean nothin'. lemme fix it. i can fix it. okay?}
<A>__{cesar and paco laugh harder.}
<C>__{benny}
<P>__{(to cesar)}
<D>__{eh, shut up, mojado!}
<P>__{(to tagger now)}
<D>__{don't mess wit' me, whiteboy. i will cap yer ass.}
<A>__{he pulls a .380 or a .25 automatic out of his pocket. brandishes it at cesar and paco...}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{i said shut up! shut the fuck up!}
<A>__{a beeper hooked on benny's pants pocket beeps. benny shuts it off. the tagger sees his opportunity and makes a break for it. without a second thought, benny shoots him in the leg. tagger crumbles to the ground. benny's really pissed now. checks his beeper's glow in the dark face for the message.}

<P>__{(reacting to message)}
<D>__{i don't have no time to put up wit' 'dis shit!}
<A>__{cesar and paco attempt to subdue their laughter but fail...}

<A>__{benny lifts a pant leg. indicates his ankle monitor with the barrel of his gun.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{i don't call my p.o. in 15 minutes, i'm fucked.}
<A>__{venting rage, benny walks up the wounded tagger and starts shooting (one hand high near his face, shooting downward). now he kisses the crucifix on his rosary like a sick, distorted affectation.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{dis is k.o.s.' neighborhood.}
<A>__{cesar and paco laugh even harder now, falling all over each other. benny storms off. he marches past a street lamp and is swallowed up by the night.}
