<L>__{interior hotel lobby night}
<A>__{in the lobby, the doors of an elevator open revealing sissy inside wearing a buttoned up dress. very formal looking for her. there is julian standing in the lobby. he turns and walks toward sissy. he is wearing a rather formal looking plaid sport coat with blue cummerbund. he extends his hand to meet her, and (perhaps at the sight of sissy's thumbs) julian has an asthma attack, doubling over in front of her. sissy doesn't know whether to assist julian or flee. from the other side of the lobby, two well groomed couples, white, mid thirties and upper middle class come to the rescue. the younger of the men, rupert, takes charge. he breaks an inhaler of dinephrine under julian's nose.}

<A>__{in the red of embarrassment, julian looks more indian than he had previously. wheezing, he speaks:}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i beg your pardon. i've been enthralled with your photographs for years. when the countess hinted that you might like to meet me he never explained why i was ready to paint for him free of charge. and now i had to go and spoil it.}
