<L>__{interior klingon bird of prey bridge}
<A>__{on a monitor where we can see a graphic depiction of the darkening star and shock wave. move to reveal we are the inside an old klingon ship it's beaten up and patched in several places, obviously not a first line model. watching the viewscreen are lursa and b'etor, two powerful looking klingon women... they are sisters. aggressive... seductive... and very dangerous. several n.d. male klingons man the various stations. the sisters stare at the image of the destroyed sun in awe.}

<A>__{soran now enters the bridge. his expression is dark and angry. he is clearly not a prisoner here and he strides up to the sisters.}
<C>__{b'etor}
<P>__{(excited, to soran)}
<D>__{you've done it, soran.}
<A>__{but without warning, soran hits b'etor squarely in the jaw, knocking her back over a console. several klingons leap to their feet, drawing their weapons... but b'etor holds up a hand as she gets to one knee.}
<C>__{b'etor}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{she dabs a trickle of blood at the corner of her mouth... her expression is angry and threatening.}
<C>__{b'etor}
<D>__{i hope for your sake that you are initiating a mating ritual.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{you got careless. the romulans came looking for their missing trilithium.}
<C>__{b'etor}
<D>__{impossible. we left no survivors on their outpost.}
<A>__{b'etor has now gotten to her feet in the b.g.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{they knew it was aboard the observatory. if the enterprise hadn't intervened, they would have found it.}
<C>__{lursa}
<D>__{but they didn't find it... and now we have a weapon of unlimited power.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{i have the weapon, lursa. and if you ever want me to give it to you, i advise you to be a little more careful in the future.}
<A>__{b'etor grabs soran and holds a wicked looking knife to his throat.}
<C>__{b'etor}
<D>__{perhaps we are tired of waiting.}
<A>__{soran is unfazed by this threat.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{without my research... the trilithium is worthless... as are your plans to reconquer the klingon empire.}
