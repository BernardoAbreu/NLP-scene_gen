<L>__{interior shelly's office overlooking the casino floor night}
<A>__{...the chip becoming an alka seltzer dropping into a glass. the glass is in shelly kaplow's hand. director of casino operations for the shangri la. late 40's early 50's. distinguished, slick, oozing charm. but lose the cartier, armani and paco raban and you're looking at pure street. he's watching bernie through the two way glass. shakes his head in admiration. suddenly the office door swings open. three men stride in. shelly projects immediate deference to nicky "fingers" bonnatto. mid 50's. former geovassi family underboss from "back east." the guy's a relic from the days before mbas became the weapon of choice in the "family" business. he wears his corporate makeover like a bad coat of paint with traces of mulberry street primer showing through. nicky's accompanied by a pair of corporate types in hugo boss threads. shelly glances their way with a look that suggests he's working himself into a full on sphincter wind up. bad news x2. shelly's muscle, lou stands off to one side with an apologetic expression.}
