<A>__{the taxi motors along. }
<L>__{interior pub i. night}
<A>__{a man at the bar is now wearing the red anorak. begbie divides up the money among sick boy, tommy, spud, and renton. renton takes his share.}
<C>__{begbie}
<D>__{and remember, rents: no skag.}
<C>__{renton}
<D>__{aye, ok, fr.}
<C>__{renton}
<P>__{(v.o)}
<D>__{but the good times couldn't last for ever.}
<L>__{interior swanney's flat. day}
<A>__{renton lies as before. around the room are swanney, allison, tommy, spud and sick boy. allison begins screaming and wailing. slowly, the others rouse themselves to varying degrees.}
<C>__{renton}
<P>__{(v.o)}
<D>__{i think allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. she might have been screaming for a week for all i knew. it's been days since i've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<D>__{what's wrong, allison?}
<A>__{allison points toward the bundle of dirty blankets in which her baby is wrapped. sick boy follows her directions.}
<C>__{spud}
<A>__{calm down, calm down. it's going to be all right, everything's going to be just fine.}
<C>__{renton}
<P>__{(v.o)}
<D>__{nothing could have been further from the truth. in point of fact, nothing at all was going to be just fine. on the contrary, everything was going to be bad. bad? i mean worse than it already was.}
<A>__{sick boy stands over the bundle. the baby is dead.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<A>__{oh, fuck. sick boy reaches out to allison.}
<C>__{renton}
<P>__{(v.o)}
<D>__{it wasn't my baby. she wasn't my baby. baby dawn. she wasn't mine. spud's? swanney's? sick boy's? i don't know. maybe allison knew. maybe not. i wished i could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.}
<C>__{sick boy}
<A>__{say something, mark, say something }
<C>__{renton}
<A>__{i'm cooking' up. there is a silence. renton begins scrambling around through the works.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{cook one for me, renton. i need a hit.}
<C>__{renton}
<P>__{(v.o)}
<D>__{and so she did, i could understand that. to take the pain away. so i cooked up and she got a hit, but only after me. that went without saying.}
