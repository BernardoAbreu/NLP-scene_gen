<A>__{we slowly pan through a suburban neighbourhood located on the south shore of long island. the still shroud of night blankets the village of amityville in the early morning hours. title card appears: thursday, november 14, 1974. title card dissolves. stray house pets are the only signs of life as families and neighbours slumber. we reach 112 ocean avenue, a large dutch colonial house. the home is a classic piece of americana, two stories plus an attic, several rooms, and a boathouse on the amityville river. there are quarter round windows on the top floor that give the appearance of eyes staring back at us. a signpost in the front yard reads "high hopes", a testament to what the home symbolizes for the family that live there.}
