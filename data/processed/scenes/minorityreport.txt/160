<A>__{lisa walks hurriedly down a side street. she stands out in her white dress a spot of vulnerable color in world of black. too vulnerable to pass up. a man in a gray overcoat slides out from between two buildings in front of her. he is not coy about his intent. he comes straight at her, all business. lisa freezes in place. she looks at her watch. the man grabs her by the shoulder. when she starts to scream, he claps his hand over her mouth, hard.}

<D>__{you bite me, bitch, i will pull your teeth out.}
<A>__{her eyes look around frantically. he starts to drag her backwards into the dark. anderson leaps into view, and slams the man's head into a light post. it takes a lot of slamming before lie loosens his grip on lisa. his legs at last collapse under him. anderson scoops lisa off the ground. she hugs him hard. then pulls back from him. she gives him a look.}
