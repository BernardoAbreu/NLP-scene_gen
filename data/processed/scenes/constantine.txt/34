<A>__{music floods this exclusive establishment. it's a clash of cultures and influences not easily dated. a retro speakeasy for the new millennium. john walks through a maze of passages while the fantasies of a twisted city play out in the shadows. he pauses, sees a clan of suited businessmen in a corner, showing off for several ladies. one fills a line of shot glasses from a pitcher of water. another waves his hand over them, turns the water into red wine. the ladies are very impressed, drink up. nico, a young black man, walks past john.}
