<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the same view of mater but now through a telescopic display. reveal finn and holley watching from high above in a downtown office building, behind reflective glass.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{why is he in the pits? he's so exposed.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{it's his cover. one of the best i've seen, too. look at the detail on that rust. it must have cost him a fortune.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{but why hasn't he contacted us yet?}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{there's probably heat on him. be patient.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{right, of course. he'll signal us when he can.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{and then we find out who's behind all this.}
<A>__{on the track various shots of the race through tokyo as francesco extends his lead and mcqueen attempts to make up ground. in mcqueen's pit mater watches the monitors, sees them approaching the dirt section.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{mcqueen! it's time to make your move. get on the outside and show 'em what doc done taught you.}
<C>__{mcqueen }
<D>__{ten four, mater.}
<A>__{on the track francesco hits the dirt section and loses all control. he slams to a halt, his tires getting no traction.}
<C>__{david hobbscap }
<D>__{francesco is brought to a screeching halt!}
<A>__{mcqueen skids into view, turning right to go left, passing francesco, followed by other cars }
<C>__{brent mustangburger }
<D>__{lightning mcqueen is the first to take advantage. and just like that, folks, francesco's lead is left in the dust.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{nice call, mater. keep it up!}
<A>__{mcqueen now leads the pack, zooming out of the dirt now starting to relax.}
<C>__{darrell cartrip }
<D>__{who hoo! man, mcqueen looks happier than a rollbar at a demolition derby!}
<A>__{on paved road again moments later the field of cars thunders into a tunnel.}
<C>__{brent mustangburger }
<D>__{everyone's jostling for position as we hit the asphalt again.}
<A>__{francesco crests the hill, in last place. he bites down, determined, then chases.}
<C>__{brent mustangburger }
<D>__{francesco lost a lot of momentum in the dirt. he's got some serious work ahead of him if he wants to get back in this race.}
<A>__{various shots of tokyo as the racers move through the rainbow bridge. bit by bit, francesco ekes his way toward the front, toward lightning mcqueen as we cut to a rooftop, and a view through the wgp camera lens. grem and acer are manning this one. they focus it on the racers as they approach.}
<C>__{professor zundapp }
<D>__{it is time.}
<C>__{grem}
<D>__{roger that.}
<A>__{on the track a racer (miguel camino) suddenly plumes with smoke and skids out.}
<C>__{darrell cartrip }
<D>__{oh! miguel camino has blown an engine!}
<C>__{brent mustangburger }
<D>__{very unusual, darrell. he's been so consistent all year.}
<A>__{camino quickly pits, passing mcqueen's pit where mater is visible. on grem and acer, watching from above.}
<C>__{grem}
<D>__{you gotta be kidding me.}
<C>__{acer}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{grem}
<D>__{it's that tow truck from the bathroom.}
<C>__{acer}
<D>__{the one from the bathroom?}
<C>__{grem}
<D>__{yeah, the one the american agent passed the device to.}
<C>__{acer}
<D>__{what about him?}
<C>__{grem}
<D>__{what about him? he's in the pits!}
<C>__{acer}
<D>__{not for long.}
<A>__{acer exits, with purpose. on finn and holley, still in their office hideaway. holley's onboard computer flashes an alert.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{hold on. i think i've got something.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{the pacer from the party last night.}
<A>__{she's spotted acer, moving swiftly forward.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{cross referencing with the photos from the oil derricks... yep. his vin numbers match.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{anyone with him? he won't be alone.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{conducting analysis on the target.}
<A>__{the computer finds more and more bad guy pacers and gremlins are in the crowd.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{he's not the only one here. three... five... they're everywhere. and they're all closing in on... oh no.}
<A>__{we pan over to see it's mater.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{finn? finn, where are you?}
<A>__{she turns. he's gone, leaving only an open window.}
<C>__{finn }
<D>__{get him out of the pits now!}
<A>__{in mcqueen's pit. a car whips by o.s.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{wow! some of them fellers is really loud.}
<C>__{holley }
<D>__{can you hear me? over.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{uh, what?}
<C>__{holley }
<D>__{get out of the pit now. do you hear me?}
<A>__{mater realizes this girl has somehow broken into his radio.}
<C>__{mater }
<D>__{hey, i know you. you're that girl from the party last night. you wanna do our date right now?}
<A>__{on the track mcqueen boxes out francesco, holds his slim lead, but barely.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{guys, a little too much chatter. let's keep this line clear.}
<A>__{boom! a racer behind mcqueen suddenly expels black smoke, skids out of control. on grem laughing. that was clearly his handiwork. in mcqueen's pit same}
<C>__{holley }
<D>__{there's no time for messing about. you've got to get out of the pits.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{is there gonna be cable where you is so i can watch the rest of the race?}
<A>__{on holley watching from the downtown building.}
<C>__{holley }
<D>__{you're running out of time!}
<C>__{finn }
<D>__{they're coming, shiftwell.}
<C>__{holley }
<D>__{yes, i know.}
<C>__{finn }
<D>__{get him out of there.}
<C>__{holley}
<P>__{(to finn)}
<D>__{i'm trying.}
<P>__{(to mater)}
<D>__{get out now!}
<A>__{we cut back to mater. he gives in, exits the pit.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{well, all right but i usually like to have a proper detailing done before i meet a lady friend.}
<A>__{he moves toward the back pit door, is about to open it. outside the pits acer and another pacer approach mcqueen's pit door on the other side. ready to pounce. the doors open, revealing finn, holding a fire extinguisher.}
<C>__{acer}
<D>__{finn mcmissile? but you're dead!}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{then this shouldn't hurt at all.}
<A>__{he empties the extinguisher in their eyes, speeds past. they try and follow, but have been blinded. one of them crashes right into a cop. on finn already on the move, along a side street.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{miss shiftwell?}
<A>__{on holley tracking everything on a grid map. mater looks like pac man, weaving through the streets as bad guys close in all around him.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{i've got him in the back alleys east of the garages. multiple assailants are closing in quickly.}
<C>__{finn }
<D>__{keep him moving. i'm on my way.}
<A>__{on mater he turns a corner, sees a flower shop.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{hey, new lady friend? you like flowers?}
<A>__{on the track mcqueen, hearing this, is taken aback.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{on mater slowing at the flower shop.}
<C>__{holley }
<D>__{no! don't go 'in' anywhere. just keep moving.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{stay outside. gotcha.}
<B>__{on the track}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{outside?}
<A>__{mcqueen drifts outside allowing francesco to slip past!}
<C>__{francesco}
<D>__{grazie and arrivaderci!}
<C>__{darrell cartrip }
<D>__{i cannot believe what i just saw, brent. that was a bonehead move. you don't open up the inside like that!}
<A>__{in the back alleys as mater moves on he's followed by pacers and gremlins. suddenly cables whip in front of them, pulling over flower vending machines and sending the shop's owners into a frenzy. they direct their attention to the amcs, who try and explain. on finn, admiring his handiwork as he appears. just as he turns to leave he's broadsided and pushed into a dark alley. in the alley finn finds himself boxed by two pacers and pushed toward acer, who now holds a flame thrower.}
<C>__{acer}
<D>__{this time i'm gonna make sure you stay dead.}
<A>__{he hits the flame. whooosssh!! on another street mater clicks along, still looking for holley. just as he passes the alley entrance where finn stares down death:}
<C>__{holley }
<D>__{you're doing brilliantly. now just stay focused.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{what's that? you want me to head toward that ruckus?}
<A>__{mater turns into the alley.}
<C>__{holley }
<D>__{no! don't go down that street!}
<A>__{in the alley finn, now nearly pushed completely into the flame thrower, leaps into the air. he fights back, using his wheels, axle, indeed his entire car frame as if he were human, kicking and tossing and shooting his enemies. mater witnesses the whole thing.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{wow! a live karate demonstration!}
<A>__{on the track mcqueen, now playing catch up again, scowls.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{stop it, mater. just sign off.}
<A>__{in the back alley finn polishes off the amcs by firing a bullet into a gas main line, causing an explosion that tosses acer through the air where he lands in a noodle shop's sign. on the track the end of the race is nigh }
<C>__{brent mustangburger }
<D>__{they're bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line!}
<A>__{the formula car gets there first.}
<C>__{brent mustangburger }
<D>__{francesco's the winner, mcqueen's number two!}
<A>__{in the alley finn heaves breaths, surveys his damage.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{that was cool! hey, can i get your autograph?}
<A>__{mater approaches when a mass of race fans burst out a door, momentarily blocking mater's view of finn. once the fans have past, finn has disappeared.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{hey, where'd he go?}
<C>__{holley }
<D>__{our rendezvous has been jeopardized. keep the device safe. we'll be in touch.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{dadgum, did i miss our date?}
