<D>__{take a look, swann! these are your friends.}
<A>__{on swann, reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at quaid and jennifer.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{what have you done to him?}
<A>__{swann's p.o.v. of quaid and jennifer. to swann's eyes, their faces seem to be morphing. their humanity is melting away. what's left is like a jellyfish with black, soulless eyes: primeval muck.}

<D>__{come here. share the power.}
<A>__{on a gun, leveled. .we don't see by whom. the trigger is pulled. the bullet strikes nix's back and explodes out of his chest. on swann, staring at nix. swann's p.o.v. of nix, as the aura of light dies. just for a moment a terrible moment swann glimpses something else. morphing out of nix's features. a nightmare face with waves of darkness emanating from the middle of its forehead. swann covers his eyes.}

<P>__{(raging, terrifying)}
<D>__{swann! swann!}
<A>__{nix staggers, letting out an ungodly howl, and drops to his knees, clutching the wound. as he falls, he reveals the ashen girl, who is still holding swann's smoking gun.}

<P>__{(a roar)}
<D>__{help me!}
<A>__{swann shakes his head, ridding himself of nix's mind control.}
