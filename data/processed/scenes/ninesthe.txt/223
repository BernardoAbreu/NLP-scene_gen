<L>__{interior kitchen morning}
<A>__{hands reach up, expecting to find glasses, but there are none. as we pull out, we reveal it's not mary, melissa or margaret, but a fourth person just slightly different from any of them. we'll call her m. she looks first to the spot where gabriel was standing. empty.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{honey, do we have nutmeg?}
<A>__{m looks over at husband ben, who is busy making pancakes, reading from a recipe.}

<C>__{noelle}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{if i had a horse...}
<A>__{noelle turns back with the spices, handing them to ben one at a time.}
<C>__{noelle }
<D>__{i would name her cinnamon.}
<C>__{ben}

<A>__{noelle only gives her a half crazy look.}
<C>__{noelle}
<D>__{mmmmmmmmmm mommy.}
<A>__{noelle smiles. m smiles too, a little embarrassed.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{right. exactly.}

<C>__{ben}
<D>__{honey? is it supposed to stick like this?}
<A>__{sharing a look...}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{we should help him.}
<A>__{noelle agrees. they head over to assist. we move across the family as they work on the pancakes, noelle directing how big the ears on hers should be. we leave them in the middle of a messy kitchen, gooey pancakes, and a good life.}
