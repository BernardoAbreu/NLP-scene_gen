<L>__{exterior hochstetler's buggy day}
<A>__{hochstetler and his family sit, impassive, ignoring various jeers and taunts from the english lads various jokes about them being dirty etc. one jabs an ice cream cone into hochstetler's forehead, which leaves a curious white circle on his forehead. another fools about with the horse causing it to shy. a third notices the slow, sure, approach of john book.}
<C>__{youth}
<D>__{here comes another one!}
<A>__{book stops, his path blocked by the third youth. the youth flicks off book's hat.}
<C>__{book}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you're making a mistake.}
<A>__{hochstetler calls from his buggy.}
<C>__{hochstetler}
<D>__{everything is all right, john.}
<C>__{book}
<P>__{(to the youth)}
<D>__{pick up the hat.}
<A>__{the youth momentarily unsure something about book's tone of voice. the youth does pick up the hat, crumples it, stamps on it, and puts it back at a crazy angle on book's head. a pause, then book explodes. the kid never knew what hit him or where it came from, he hits the road surface already unconscious. a second youth grabs book from behind. a mistake. book is smashing into him, spatters of blood from his nose flying in all directions. he's hitting too hard, too often. it's schaeffer he's hitting. hochstetler is pulling him away, rachel is there too. a crowd is gathering, but as suddenly as it began it's over. book shakes hochstetler off him, straightens his hat, and in a kind of daze, begins walking past the scene in the direction of the lapp farm. the youths are picking up their wounded, helping them back to their truck, aided by none other than hochstetler. an old local addresses rachel.}
<C>__{local man}
<D>__{never seen anything like that in all my years.}

<P>__{(addresses a gathering crow)}
<D>__{our lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{john, lost control of himself. he... will be repentant.}
<C>__{local man}
<P>__{(to rachel)}
<D>__{you're rachel lapp, aren't you?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{yes. samuel! we're going.}
<A>__{a second man calls from the pickup.}
<C>__{second man}
<D>__{kid's nose is broken!}
<C>__{local man}
<D>__{we'll take him up the hospital. good day to you, mrs. lapp.}
<P>__{(he shouts after her)}
<D>__{this ain't good for the tourist trade, you know! you tell that to your ohio cousin!}
<A>__{but rachel is already steering past the scene and following the by now distant figure of john book.}
