<L>__{exterior mandalay bay rooftop night}
<A>__{the guys, dressed to the nines, open the steel rooftop door and file out onto the flat tar roof of the mandalay bay; vick is carrying a bottle of patron and four hotel glasses. bringing up the rear, alan slides a wood block between the door and the frame so they aren't locked up here. the guys step out onto the dark, windy roof and take in the stunning panorama...the strip...the mountains...the countless stars... it's breathtaking.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{thish is so great! i love you guys!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{check it out, stu's already wasted.}
<A>__{vick starts refilling everyone's glasses.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{we've only had two shots, man!}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yeah, what happened, stuey?! you used to be able to drink us all under the table!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{dude, i'm a dad! i don't have time to get plastered anymore! it blows!}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{am i a bad dad for saying that?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{what? no!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{because my dad was a bad dad.}
<C>__{doug}
<P>__{(patting his shoulder)}
<D>__{that's true, stuey, but you're different. we've talked about this.}
<A>__{stu just stares at the guys, glassy eyed. beat.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{have i showed you guys pictures of my kids yet ? alan & doug & vick yes!}
<A>__{doug laughs and raises his glass for a toast, heartfelt:}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{little toast: to tracy, the coolest, kindest, most beautiful woman i've ever met. i can't believe she let me come this weekend much less agreed to spend the rest of her life with me. i think both will prove to be massive errors of judgement on her part.}
<A>__{the guys chuckle, hear hear.}
<C>__{doug }
<D>__{and to being here, with my best friends in the world. there's nowhere else i'd rather be.}
<A>__{the guys raise their glasses, touched.}
<C>__{doug }
<D>__{that said, let's not get too stupid tonight, okay? i'm getting married in 36 hours. alan & stu & vick no, no. we'll be good. totally, dude.}
<A>__{doug lowers his glass, laughing, completely unconvinced.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i'm serious, dudes! nothing above the neck no piercings, no weird haircuts, no facial tattoos. i gotta look decent on sunday.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{jesus, what do you take us for?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{vick: you shaved alan's eyebrows off the night before graduation!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{oh yeah! that was hilarious! and remember when i blacked out at homecoming and you wrote on my face with permanent marker?! that was awesome! what'd you write again? alan & doug & vick "respect me!"}
<A>__{they all laugh. stu throws his arm around doug, nostalgic.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{ahh, good times, man. good times...}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{we'll be good tonight, doug.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{seriously, man, we're your friends.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{yeah, we've totally grown up since then.}
<A>__{doug looks at them, highly dubious, then hoists his glass.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{well then...to a night we'll never forget.}
<A>__{they clink glasses, shoot their shots, and}
