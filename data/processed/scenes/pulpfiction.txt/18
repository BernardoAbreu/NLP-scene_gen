<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior lance's house (kitchen) night}
<B>__{closeup jody}
<A>__{a woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. both of her ears are pierced five times. she also sports rings in her lips, eyebrows and nose.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{...i will lend it to you. it's a great book on body piercing.}
<A>__{jody, vincent and a young woman named trudi sit at the kitchen table of a suburban house in echo park. even though vince is at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.}
<C>__{trudi}
<D>__{you know how they use that gun when they pierce your ears? they don't use that when they pierce your nipples, do they?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{forget that gun. that gun goes against the entire idea behind piercing. all of my piercing, sixteen places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle. five in each ear. one through the nipple on my left breast. one through my right nostril. one through my left eyebrow. one through my lip. one in my clit. and i wear a stud in my tongue.}
<A>__{vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear and out the other, until that last remark.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{excuse me, sorry to interrupt. i'm curious, why would you get a stud in your tongue?}
<A>__{jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{it's a sex thing. it helps fellatio.}
<A>__{that thought never occurred to vincent, but he can't deny it makes sense. jody continues talking to trudi, leaving vincent to ponder the truth of her statement.}
<C>__{lance }
<D>__{vince, you can come in now!}
