<L>__{interior obsession room day}
<A>__{the room is filled with smoke and suffused with blue light. two of the walls simply part physically, revealing entrances into the corridors of hell. these corridors are lined with gray walls and seem to run for a great distance. tiffany still sits cross legged in the middle of the floor, staring about her in astonishment. surrounding her, in various parts of the room, are the four cenobites from hellraiser. the female cenobite smiles and advances towards tiffany. the leader of the cenobites, pinhead raises a hand.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{wait.}
<A>__{the female stops and looks questioningly at pinhead. pinhead, at a more leisurely pace, crosses towards tiffany and looks down at her. she stares back at him, the remnants of her insanity a temporary defense against fear, her face registering nothing. pinhead looks up.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{the female looks across at him.}
<C>__{cenobite}
<D>__{no?}
<A>__{pinhead shakes his head.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he glances down at tiffany again.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{it is not hands that call us...}
<A>__{he looks up and stares directly at the shattered two way mirror.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{... it is desire.}
