<C>__{marcia}
<D>__{to me, it's obvious.}

<D>__{okay, but what about mrs. dalton ? he claims he took her to the movies.}
<C>__{marcia}
<D>__{she's his alibi. she covered for him when he strangled his wife. she said he was at work all day.}
<C>__{larry}

<D>__{she's a colleague who maybe loves him.}

<D>__{cheating on two women ?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, yeah. it's perfect. just, it all fits.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{the guy doesn't look the part.}
<C>__{marcia}
<D>__{the point is, he's gotten away with the perfect murder. there are no bodies around to prove anything. and all the paperwork is strictly above board. he's home free.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{oh, my... oh, where did you find this woman ? she's a genius.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{she's brilliant. she's brilliant. but the guy... he knows that we know, so if he knows we're on him.}

<D>__{what ? name one.}
<C>__{carol }
<D>__{name one? okay, the guy looks us straight in the eyes and says, what body? what the hell are you talking about ? prove it.}
