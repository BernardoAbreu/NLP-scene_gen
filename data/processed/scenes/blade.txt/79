<L>__{interior whistler's workshop day}
<A>__{karen stands at a lab table with whistler, preparing a number of blood sample vials. they are surrounded by host of new medical equipment from centrifuges to genetic sequencers and beyond. blade emerges from his room, looks to karen. as if by silent agreement, last night's words go unacknowledged. he straps on his bandoleer of stakes, secures his scabbard.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{going somewhere?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{china town. i need more serum.}
<P>__{(re: new equipment)}
<D>__{what's all this?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{for your miracle cure?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{she's been making real progress, blade.}
<P>__{(to karen)}
<D>__{show him }
<A>__{karen looks to blade, who shrugs. she opens a refrigerator, removing a syringe filled with blue fluid.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{this is sodium citrate. it's an anti coagulant. we use it to treat blood clots sometimes. vampire blood is thinner than humans, though. watch what happens when i introduce some into a sample }
<A>__{karen gestures to the microscope. blade takes a look blade's pov vampire blood cells swirling about. karen injects the contents of the syringe onto the slide of cells the reaction is immediate. the vampire blood turns black, then begins violently bubbling. blade lifts his head away from the microscope just in time the blood on the slide atomizes, exploding outward in a fine mist which bursts apart the glass lens of the scope. whistler laughs, thrilled with the results.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{can you imagine what a dash of that would do on your sword?}
<A>__{whistler claps his hand on karen's shoulder in approval, then limps away, quickly busying himself with another project. blade moves to follow, but karen stops him }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{before you go, i'd like to take a sample of your blood.}
<A>__{blade grudgingly rolls up his sleeve. as karen takes her sample, blade looks to whistler. the older man brings a handkerchief to his lips, coughing into it.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{is he sick?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{cancer.}
<A>__{karen watches as blade's blood flows into the vacutainer. she fills the first, then inserts another.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you care about him, don't you?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{we've got a good arrangement, that's all. whistler makes the weapons, i use them, the vampires die end of story.}
<A>__{karen finishes. blade rolls up his sleeve.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{my mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{your mother sounds like a hallmark greeting card.}
<A>__{blade slips his casulls into a shoulder holster, then shrugs into his leather jacket, donning his sunglasses.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i'd wish you luck, doc, but i never put much stock in optimism.}
<A>__{he heads towards the elevator.}
