<L>__{interior subway platform night}
<A>__{amy stands on the platform as a train whooshes into the station at hyper speed then stops instantly in front of her. the doors hiss open and amy is greeted by the tall odd looking conductor. she pushes past him.}
<L>__{interior train night}
<A>__{the train lurches forward as amy makes her way through the usual crowd of celebrants. she finds joey sitting court in the middle of the train car. he's wearing a pair of terminator sunglasses. amy approaches. his face seems sickly pale in the flashing light. he moves abruptly, a slight turn of the head toward her.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{well look who's back. what now?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i need... please... please help me.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{help you with what?}
<A>__{amy hesitates an instant, then tugs open her shirt, revealing the gaffer's tape that holds the rolled up towel to her back. she works at it. finally, it tears. she tears it straight down the front of her chest as joey watches, passive. her chest is stained with blood. she licks her fingers and wipes the blood away from the middle of her chest. joey's eyes narrow. he leans forward to study it. he leans in closer, hesitates, then leans back, looking amy in the eye.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{wow, are those real?}
<A>__{amy doesn't react.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{okay, you're not in the mood for my light hearted banter. what the hell, this isn't my idea of paradise either.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i don't understand. why aren't i dead? or am i? please...}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{life, death, they're not all that different, really. you can find your death in your life. you can find your life in your death. round and round and round you go.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{please, help me.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i am helping you.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{then explain what the hell is going on. why did i have a knife buried in my back? why am i seeing dead people walking around? why is there a guy with pins in his head stopping by in the middle of the night for a chat.}
<A>__{she gets in his face.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{why am i not dead!}
<A>__{there's a jolt as the train starts to pull into the station. the light from the station begins to illuminate the inside of the car more clearly. joey leans back from her.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{whoa. it's time to give in amy, you're just fighting it too hard. forget about the truth, forget about reality, just sit back and enjoy the ride. there's nothing you can do anyway. we're all just piece's in winter's little puzzle.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{the box.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{you're willing to do anything to find the truth.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{that's what i find most attractive about you. well, that and the fact that you have a great ass. you and i are the same really, we're both willing to take it as far as it will go, to the edge, to the extreme.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know what our biggest problem is amy klein? neither of us know when to get off the god damn train.}
<A>__{the train jerks to a stop, tossing amy a little. she regains her footage and turns back to joey but in the flickering fluorescent light, joey's skin suddenly looks sickly pale.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{joey?}
<A>__{he doesn't answer. he doesn't move.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{joey come on. let's get off the train. right now, you and me.}
<A>__{he still doesn't move. amy reaches out a shaky hand and takes his glasses off.}
<C>__{amy}
<P>__{(voice trailing off)}
<D>__{you and me...}
<A>__{joey's eyes are empty, glazed. he's dead. not only is he dead, it's clear that he's been dead for awhile. then she freezes when she realizes the sound has completely dropped out around her. all she can hear is her heart beating. she slowly turns around to find that all of joey's celebrants on the train are also dead and surrounded by the familiar buzz of flies. some of the dead are hung from the hand rails by hooks and chains, their throats slashed, eyes gouged, bullet holes in the head, etc... a large female cenobite is sewing the filleted skin from one deaders throat open to reveal his vocal chords. he makes a sound at amy and his chords vibrate. but there's this one coke head guy who was snorting a line when amy got on the train. he looks normal as he snorts up the last rail off his hand held mirror. she studies him for a moment when suddenly he turns to her and we get a good look at his face. the entire left side of his face has rotted away and we can see the powdery coke lining his decaying left nostril.}
<D>__{coke head guy looks like the party's over.}
<A>__{suddenly all she can her is the loud roar of the train. amy stumbles back, turns to run into the next train car and smacks right into marla chen. a horribly decaying marla chen. at first amy is confused but then something clicks behind her eyes as she shoves marla back down the train car.}
<C>__{amy}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{why did you do this to me?}
<A>__{the trains screeches into the station and the doors hiss}
<B>__{open.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{we have to go...}
<C>__{amy}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{i didn't have any other choice.}
<A>__{amy looks down at her shirt as blood begins to soak through it.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what's happening to me?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{you're dying.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{like me.}
<A>__{marla grabs her hand and starts to pull her along.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{please. we've got to go!}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{that's for you to decide.}
<A>__{amy looks around the platform, as if deciding what to do. there's a little panic in marla's voice.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{you see, that's the problem right there. i'm supposed to help you. like... like winter helped me. but i don't know if i can.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{then why are you here?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{to try... because i have no other choice. no turning back now }
<P>__{(re:how she looks)}
<D>__{know what i mean?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{no, i don't. i don't know one god damn thing anymore.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i just want to go home.}
<A>__{marla gives her a comforting smile.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{then let's go home.}
<A>__{they jump down to an abandoned track and head into the darkness.}
