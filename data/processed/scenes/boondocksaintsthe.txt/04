<L>__{interior noland's meat packing plant cut station same day:}
<A>__{rozengurtle and connor stand in front of a bunch of co workers who are cutting meat as it goes by on assembly.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{rule of thumb?}
<C>__{connor}
<P>__{(questioningly)}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{do you know where that term comes from? in the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.}
<A>__{connor holds up his thumb and stares at it.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{can't do much damage with that. perhaps, it shoulda been the rule of wrist. ha!}
<P>__{(he elbows her)}
<D>__{rule of wrist.}
<A>__{she returns an icy stare. he hands her the knife. the co workers all seem wary of roz. murphy stands on one side of roz, connor on the other, surrounded by a tight group of workers. everyone is within ear shot of one another, cutting meat as it goes by. knowing glances are shared by everyone. it is an uncomfortable mood.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{hey murphy?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{aye.}
<C>__{connor}
<P>__{(slight smirk)}
<D>__{how many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{two. one ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.}
<A>__{everyone burst out laughing. rozengurtle jabs a knife in a piece of meat and turns to connor. she pushes him and starts walking toward him. he starts backing up, laughing.}
<C>__{roz}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{i knew you two pricks would give me problems. give me shit cause i'm a woman. i'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!}
<C>__{connor}
<P>__{(trying to calm her, but still chuckling)}
<D>__{oh, come on now rozengurtle. i was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{yeah. just tryin' ta break the ice is all.}
<C>__{roz}
<P>__{(to murphy)}
<D>__{fuck you...}
<P>__{(to connor)}
<D>__{...and fuck you!}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{oh, come on its st. patty's day. it's all in good fun.}
<A>__{employees gather around all the excitement.}
<C>__{roz }
<D>__{baumgartner sound irish to you, fuck face?}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{now look rozengurtle, we're sorry. just relax.}
<A>__{she reaches back and punches connor full force in the face. he takes the hit very well. he stops backing up.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{why don't you save all your aggression for protests and marches and what not.}
<A>__{she suddenly drives her boot into his crotch, sending him to the floor reeling with pain. two female co workers leap to his aid.}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{you fuckin' slaves. kowtowing to the needs of men! get up! get the fuck up! leave him there.}
<A>__{rozengurtle begins to turn, raising her fist to murphy. murphy winds up and punches her square in the face. she lands on her back. the on lookers are stunned as he walks over and stands above her.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{guess you'll have ta change that tattoo now, won't ya rozie!?}
