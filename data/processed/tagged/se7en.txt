<A>__{the white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky. the church bell rings, resonating. mass has let out. small church, small congregation. the dirt road in front is lined with pick up trucks and parishioners on foot heading to outlying farms and homes. an old two story house sits across the road. lone.}
<L>__{interior old house day}
<A>__{sunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than bright. somerset, 45, in a suit and tie, stands in this empty second story room. he looks around, at the ceiling, at the worn wooden floor, at the peeling wallpaper on the walls. somerset walks to one wall where the current wallpaper is peeled away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath. he runs his finger across one of the pale red roses that decorates the older paper. he pushes the grime away, brings the rose out more clearly. he pulls at the edge of the paper, carefully ripping off a roughly squared section with the rose at its center. he studies it in his hand.}

<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{is something wrong?}
<A>__{somerset does not respond. the man, in an ill fitting real estate jacket, is seated on the hood of a dirty ford thunderbird. he holds a check and a booklet of receipts.}

<D>__{soon.}

<C>__{man}
<D>__{i don't know. i'd say this place is about as normal as places get.}

<D>__{that is exactly what i mean. strange.}

<L>__{interior amtrack train day (credit sequence begins)}
<A>__{somerset is in a window seat, smoking a cigarette, looking out the speeding train. he is near the back of the car, away from the few other passengers. outside, farms, small homes and lawns pass. the entire panorama is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun. the light flickers across somerset's placid face.}
<L>__{interior amtrack train later day}
<A>__{the train is nearly full. somerset has his suitcase on the aisle seat beside him. he has a hardcover book unopened on his lap. he still stares out the window, but his disposition has soured. the train is passing an ugly, swampy field. a car's burnt out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken. a little further on, two dogs are fighting, circling, attacking, their coats matted with blood. somerset turns his head to watch the dogs. away in the field, another dog sprints to join the fight.}
<L>__{interior amtrack train early evening}
<A>__{passing urban streets below. slums. smashed cars. people stand on the corners, under the bleak glow of street lamps. somerset's suitcase is by the window. somerset is now in the aisle seat, reading his book.}

<A>__{curtains closed. the sounds of the city are here as they will be everywhere in this story. a car alarm shrieks. somerset's life is packed in many moving boxes, except for clothing in a closet and hundreds of books on shelves. somerset, dressed only in his underwear, lays back on the bed. he reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical metronome. he frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and forth. swings to the left... tick, swings to the right... tick. tick, tick, tick, measured and steady. somerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes. the metronome's ticking competes with the sound of the car alarm. somerset's face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome. his eyes close tighter. tick, tick, tick... the swingarm moves evenly. somerset's breathing deepens. the car alarm seems quieter. tick, tick, tick. somerset continues his concentration. the metronome is the only sound. somerset's face relaxes slightly as he begins to fall asleep. tick, tick, tick...}
<L>__{exterior chinese bodega city streets night}
<A>__{david mills, 31, exits with a bagged 40oz bottle of beer. he is a lean, attractive man, constantly coiled, eyes always smoldering. follow as he walks quickly past iron gated storefronts. he crosses the street under elevated subway tracks. a train roars overhead. mills watches it as he walks on. blue sparks spit off the third rail and illuminate mills, throwing his shadow long down the deserted street.}
<L>__{exterior urban street of row homes night}
<A>__{this rotting neighborhood lives in the shadow of a single fat skyscraper. mills walks, looks at the broken refrigerators and pieces of junk in the gutter. ahead in the street, two young thugs struggle with a crowbar to break into the trunk of a parked car. mills draws near. one thug looks up, doesn't think mills will be a problem, continues prying. mills stops, calm.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{is that your car, man?}
<C>__{first thug}
<D>__{what the fuck do you care?}
<A>__{mills pauses, switches his beer bottle to his other hand.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{does that car belong to you?}
<A>__{the thugs look at each other, gauging. they face mills.}
<C>__{first thug}
<D>__{yeah, it's my car, alright? fuck off.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{you're telling me that's your car?}
<A>__{the second thug starts the long way round the car.}
<C>__{second thug}
<D>__{well, for some strange reason, i don't believe you.}
<A>__{mills gives a "isn't that silly" laugh, shifts his gaze sees the first thug slide the crowbar so it's held as a weapon.}
<C>__{first thug}
<P>__{(steps forward)}
<D>__{you can fucking suck my...}
<A>__{mills swiftly finishes that sentence by smashing his bottle against the first thug's head. the thug falls, swings blindly. the second thug moves from the side, brings out a knife. mills averts, swings, pounds the side of his fist into the second thug's face crack. broken nose. the second thug stumbles back, drops the knife, his nose squirting blood. mills turns, enraged, breathing hard. the first thug is screaming, trying to stand. mills takes one step, punts the first thug's head. the crowbar clatters away. mills is in the process of kicking a man when he's down, when the second thug grabs him from behind, pulls him backwards. mills clutches at the thug's arm, trying to avoid a choke hold. they both struggle spastically. the thug's winning. gurgling, gasping for air, mills shifts his weight, drops to one knee and spins the thug, slamming him against the car. mills breaks loose, grabs a handful of the second thug's hair and holds the man's head against the car's side window. mills' free hand pounds the thug's face: once, twice third time's the charm as the window shatters. the thug goes out cold. mills backs off, still incensed. he rubs his throat, looking at the two prone men. slowly, he regains some composure. he takes a keychain from his pocket. he unlocks the door of the car, loads one of the thugs into the back seat. he walks to collect the other thug off the street.}

<D>__{neighbors heard them screaming at each other. it was nothing new or unusual. but, then they heard the gun go off. boom, boom... both barrels.}

<D>__{this is a done deal. all but the paperwork.}

<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{what kind of question is that? huh?}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{he's dead. his wife killed him. there it is. that's all. anything else has nothing to do with nothing.}

<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i heard you brought in two small timers last night.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{yeah. two real idiots.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{since we are just starting out, i thought we could go to a bar. sit and talk for awhile. that way we can...}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{excuse me, but i'd rather start sniffing for a case, if it's all the same to you. seeing how we only have a week for this whole transition thing.}
<P>__{(waits)}
<D>__{i want to get into the shit a.s.a.p., know what i mean?}
<A>__{somerset walks, no reply. mills searches to get a read on him.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i meant to ask you something... when we spoke on the phone. i can't help wondering...}

<D>__{why are you here?}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(wary)}
<D>__{i... i don't follow.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{all this effort you've gone through, to be transferred from philadelphia to here. it's the first question that pops into my head.}
<A>__{mills formulates his response.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i'm here for the same reasons as you, i guess. or... at least the same reasons you used to have for being here...}
<P>__{(cutting)}
<D>__{...before you decided to give up.}
<A>__{somerset stops and faces mills.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{you think you know me? you just met me two minutes ago.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{maybe i don't understand the question.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{it's very simple. you've come from the "city of brotherly love" to the "city of brotherly hate," detective. i've never seen it done that way.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe i thought i could do more good here than there.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you know, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right out kicking each other in the balls. but, you're calling the shots, lieutenant, so however you want it to go.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{let me tell you how i want this to go. i want you to look, and i want you to listen.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i wasn't standing around philly guarding the fucking liberty bell.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{but, you've never worked homicide in this city.}

<D>__{i realize that.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{well, please do me the favor of remembering it.}

<L>__{interior somerset's apartment, bedroom early morning}
<A>__{somerset lies asleep on the bed. it is still dark outside. relatively quiet. the phone beside the inactive metronome rings harshly. somerset awakens suddenly, rankled.}
<L>__{interior mills' apartment, bedroom early morning}
<A>__{it is barely becoming light outside. mills can't sleep. alone in a double bed. he sits up, frustrated. sits on the edge of the bed and looks around. the room is a shambles, filled with moving boxes. the light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy on one box. large and noble, a golden player stands in frozen motion at the trophy's pinnacle. mills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face. the clinking of dishes and silverware is heard from another room. mills looks at the closed bedroom door, troubled.}
<L>__{interior mills' apartment, living room kitchenette early morning}
<A>__{across a living room full of boxes, tracy mills, 30, a beautiful woman, stands in her bathrobe. she's upset about something, takes dishes out of boxes, puts them on the kitchenette counter. she pulls a mug from a clump of newspaper and pours some tea from a pot on the stove. blowing on the steaming tea, she leans back on the counter, looks over at the closed bedroom door. the tea is too hot to sip, and as tracy is placing the mug on the counter behind her the phone rings. startled, she releases the mug too close to the edge. it falls crashes to the floor, shatters.}
<L>__{interior apartment crime scene, hallway morning}
<A>__{a dark hall. somerset and mills stand with officer davis, 28, a beefy, uniformed cop. light from a camera's flash spills in from the nearby kitchen. davis hands somerset two flashlights.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{at what time did you confirm the death?}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{like i said, we didn't touch anything, but we were on scene at like o five hundred, so he's had his face in a plate of spaghetti for about half an hour.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{wait, wait, wait. you didn't check him? you didn't check vital signs?}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{believe me, he's gone. unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce now.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{no. the point is, when you're first man in, you check vital signs.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{this guy's sitting in a pile of his own shit and piss. if he ain't dead he would have stood up by now.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(getting angry)}
<D>__{listen, godzilla...}
<A>__{somerset steps in, heads mills off.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{thank you, officer davis. we'll see you again after we've had a look.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{davis leaves, eyeing mills. mills watches him. somerset hands mills a flashlight, takes out surgical gloves.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{and, i wonder how many times officer davis there has found a supposedly dead man who didn't really die until davis was back in the patrol car calling the morgue and eating a powdered donut.}
<A>__{somerset snaps one glove over his hand and checks the fit.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{drop it. we have more important concerns just now, don't we?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{fine... for now.}
<L>__{interior apartment crime scene, kitchen night}
<A>__{the police photographer packs up, hoists his camera and equipment bag. somerset and mills enter. mills puts on his own pair of rubber gloves. the grubby kitchen is small; barely room for four people to move around in. the photographer exits:}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{bon appetit.}
<A>__{the only light is a murky green illumination from the ceiling. the light bathes an obese man who is slumped forward in a kitchen chair, face down dead in a plate of spaghetti. the sizable kitchen table's green tablecloth is covered with soiled paper plates. the plates hold bits of half eaten sandwiches, potatoes, donuts and other junk food remnants. mills and somerset turn on their flashlights. mills points his at the green bulb above. aluminum foil has been wrapped around the bulb to focus the light on the corpse. somerset sweeps the room with his flashlight. he goes to the body and kneels beside it. there's a rope tied around the man's wide gut. mills comes to stand beside somerset.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i guess that makes it homicide.}
<A>__{somerset crouches lower, uses a pen to lift one of the dead man's pants cuffs. rope is tied around the purplish ankle. mills examines the knots behind the chair's back. shines his flashlight on the man's belly.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{still, he could have tied himself in. to make it look like murder.}
<A>__{somerset isn't listening, focused on the corpse. he studies the man's head and neck without touching.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{i don't see any blood or bruises yet. no wounds. you see anything?}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{not yet.}
<A>__{somerset stands, points his flashlight: the obese man's stiff hands are clutching utensils. a knife in the left hand, a fork sticking straight up in the right with a hunk of meat hanging skewered. cockroaches swarm. mills turns to the sink and stove. each burner of the stove has a used pot or pan on it. there's food slopped everywhere.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i saw a guy once... committed suicide, but he wanted to make sure his family could collect insurance money, right?}
<A>__{somerset walks to the room's only window. the window has been painted over with black painterior he touches the window with his pinkie finger. the paint is still wet. mills goes to a trash can by the refrigerator. the trash can is full to the brim with empty food containers.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{so, this guy took this big knife... and he held it behind him, put the tip of it in his back, and he ran backwards into the wall. cause, he thought it was going to look like someone stabbed him in the back.}
<A>__{mills opens the refrigerator. it's nearly empty.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{except, he poked a big fucking hole in the dry wall when he did it.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{if you could... spare me the anecdotes for now. leave the refrigerator open for the light.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{oh, forgive me. i thought we had this male bonding thing going. my mistake.}
<A>__{somerset looks at the floor, deep in thought. his flashlight beam follows a trail of dripped sauces, soups and bits of food running from the stove to the table.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{what do you smell? other than him, and all the food.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(sniffs)}
<D>__{i don't know... there's something.}
<A>__{somerset goes close to the table, then leans to peer under.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{a bucket.}
<A>__{somerset points the flashlight and mills crouches, pulls up the tablecloth on his side of the table. two large dead rats lay on the floor beside a metal bucket. mills grimaces, slides under the table, careful to avoid the rats. he looks in the bucket. he leans back, baffled.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{it's vomit.}
<A>__{he looks at somerset under the table.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{it's a bucket of vomit.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{is there any blood in it?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{can't tell by looking.}
<A>__{somerset stands, perplexed, stares at the dead man. there is a knock at the door. the detectives look to doctor thomas o'neill, 52, the medical examiner. o'neill is a frumpy man, seems a bit gone, looking at the green bulb.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{mood lighting. very sixties.}
<A>__{he drops his bag on the floor, sorts through the contents.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(to somerset)}
<D>__{you think he was poisoned?}
<A>__{mills goes to the trash can, pokes the garbage with a pencil.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{and, those rats there somehow ate the poison off the floor?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{guessing this early is useless.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{you girls have got the forensics guys out there chompin' at the bit. don't know if we'll all fit in here though.}
<A>__{mills continues searching the garbage.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{there's room. light's the problem.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{well, three is certainly a crowd in here. and, with four, someone's bound to be stepping on evidence.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{detective mills, go help the officers question the neighbors.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(not pleased)}
<D>__{thanks, but no thanks. i will stay on this.}
<A>__{somerset watches o'neill at the corpse. o'neill points a thin flashlight with his mouth, his hands free for the examination.}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{send one forensic in on your way out.}
<A>__{mills is pissed. he lifts his flashlight to shine it on the side of somerset's face. a moment passes. somerset looks at mills, light shining directly in somerset's eyes. a longer moment. mills switches the light off. he leaves. o'neill unceremoniously places both hands on the dead man's head, lifts the swollen visage from the spaghetti.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{he is dead.}
<L>__{interior precinct house, basement gym day}
<A>__{thwack, thwack... thwack. mills punches the heavy bag with hard, quick punches. sweat drips off his face. he's in work out clothing, a bundle of nerves wearing boxing gloves. the walls are covered in mirrors. other cops watch mills as they pass, checking out the new kid. mills keeps punching, skillfully. he stops when he sees somerset reflected in one of the mirrors. somerset walks over, carrying a pizza box with paper piled on top. he sits on a near bench, takes out a cigarette.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{pizza and paperwork, detective mills.}

<D>__{we need to chat.}
<L>__{interior basement gym, boxing ring day}
<A>__{mills opens a door and enters with somerset behind. they are alone. chairs face an old, limp roped boxing ring. practice pads hang from pegs on a wall. mills clasps a pair in his gloves, offers them to somerset.}

<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{you just hold them up. i do all the work.}
<A>__{somerset takes the pads reluctantly, puts them on. he still has the un lit cigarette hanging from his mouth. mills climbs into the ring. he holds the ropes open for somerset, waits. somerset doesn't want to do this, but he climbs up.}

<D>__{you've seen my files... seen the things i've done?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{yes. impressive work.}
<A>__{mills motions to somerset and somerset holds up the practice pads. mills starts working them, lightly, warming up.}

<D>__{i did all that shit a long time ago.}
<A>__{thwack... thwack... somerset's very stiff, uncomfortable.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i made a decision, because i have to worry about the integrity of the scene.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{that's bullshit.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{when i'm on scene, i'm not going to worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field. i'm there to do the work.}

<C>__{mills}
<D>__{the badge in my pocket says "detective," just like yours. i've been homicide for four and a half years.}

<C>__{mills }

<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{tracy looks back at the playground: on the other side of a chain link fence, a butcher in a bloody apron walks down the ramp of a freezer truck. he carries a big, whole, slaughtered pig on his shoulder. the pig's head flops as the butcher walks. some children stop their games and run to watch the man and the pig corpse pass.}
<L>__{interior underground subway train day}
<A>__{the train clatters through a tunnel, packed full, wheels screeching. the lights go on and off. passengers read tabloids, stare at their feet, study advertisements on the walls; anything to avoid making eye contact with others. all races, creeds and colors; all ugly, forlorn human beings. tracy stands fatigued, holding a handrail. a bag lady, crusted with dirt, reeking, pushes her way through the crowd. a man presses against tracy in an attempt to let the bag lady pass. tracy switches hands on the rail, turns sideways to make room. she looks down. on one seat, a man, quite normal looking, sits holding a porno magazine, three way fuck, in one hand. his other hand is in his pocket. he's obviously masturbating himself in his pants. no one else notices or seems to care. tracy looks away, disgusted. she closes her eyes. the train's wheels screech louder as the train takes a curve.}

<D>__{but, both gardens were beset by problems. weeds started to take root, and there were infestations of insects and diseases. the gardens started to turn putrid. and, one man fought to save his garden, because he could never forget how it once was. everyday he cut the weeds, and killed the insects. fought the diseases.}
<A>__{doe finally topples the statue, down the altar stairs, and the other end of the rope pulls mills upwards, screaming in pain. mills is held, about eight feet in the air, legs dangling.}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{that man never had a beautiful garden again.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{the other man plowed his garden under.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{he plowed it under the soil. he started over.}
<A>__{somerset gets to his feet, steadying himself on a pew. doe walks across the altar, picks up a long metal pole with a thick wick and candle snuffer on the end. he lights the wick from a near candle. the flame burns long and thin. he looks down at somerset, takes out his gun.}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{stay there, somerset. or, i will kill him right now.}
<A>__{doe holds the flaming pole up, near mills. somerset stops. he looks up at mills. mills is straining. he nods to somerset, and somerset sees mills cutting at the rope.}

<D>__{alright... you don't have to do this, john. you've already made your pointerior}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{do you think i chose this? can you even begin to understand how painful my existence has been? it's like... like having every sense heightened beyond comprehension.}
<A>__{doe lowers the flame, standing below and beside mills, with his attention focused on somerset.}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{so that the stench of the street coats your throat like bile. so, sugar is so sweet it... it makes your bones ache to the marrow.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{you're insane. that's why.}
<C>__{john doe}
<P>__{(seething)}
<D>__{no! you're wrong!}
<A>__{mills continues cutting, bleeding, almost through the rope. he begins to swing his feet slightly, his body swaying.}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{i was chosen. and i've wished a thousand times i could have been a normal man. like david mills, a common man... with a common life. but, wishing that is my sin. i can't have it and i shouldn't.}
<A>__{doe steps towards mills.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{don't do this!}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{i meant what i said. i admire david mills. i envy david mills.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{envy is my sin.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{just as doe is to put the flame to mills, the rope is finally cut through. mills drops, swinging his legs forward, smashing doe in the face, knocking doe's glasses off. mills hits the floor with a thud. somerset runs forward.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{david, get out!}
<A>__{doe has fallen back, dropping the metal pole. mills scrambles to his feet and charges at doe, shouting. doe squints, screaming, raises his gun. fires twice! the bullets catch mills in mid run, and carry him off his feet, backwards. somerset grips his own gun, just as mills' body falls, tumbles off the altar area and down the stairs in front of him.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{somerset lets out a scream of pain and rage that chokes in his throat. he falls to his knees and halts mills' body. somerset's shaking, unable to breathe, turning mills over and cradling his head in his arms. tears come to his eyes.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{david... david? please...}
<A>__{on the altar, doe throws his gun away. he starts feeling around him, unsteady, looking for his glasses. mills' eyes are closed. he is still, bloody. he swallows. with one gasp, without a word, he is dead. somerset looks up at doe, vision blurred by rage and tears. doe stands, putting on his glasses, faces somerset. somerset lays mills' body down. stands, walks up towards the altar, raises his gun.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{you.}
<A>__{doe stands, quaking, teeth clenched, fists balled up. he waits for the bullets, falls to his knees. the gun trembles in somerset's hand as somerset brings the barrel to doe's face. a millisecond's pause. somerset changes the angle of fire. blam, he blows john doe's arm to pieces in a splattering explosion. doe screams, falling back, on the altar floor.}
<B>__{viewed from far back in the church}
<A>__{the entire church with its candles frames the torture: somerset walks to where doe flops horribly, bleeding. somerset aims, shoots doe in the leg. doe screams, rolling, trying to crawl away, knocking over candle racks. somerset follows. he shoots doe's other leg. he shoots doe in the other arm. flames begin to rise and spread quickly amongst the pews. doe continues to spasm, wrenching, hand slapping the bloody floor. blam, blam, blam. somerset steps back from doe, overturns a rack of candles on top of him. he steps away. watching. flames begin rising on doe's clothing. close on john doe's face doe's face, covered in blood, twisted in agony, helpless, flames rising. he continues screaming. his glasses crack from the heat.}
<L>__{exterior abandoned church orphanage night}

<A>__{the seven deadly sin tableau burns. flames cause the paint to bubble and blacken. gluttony, greed and sloth are already halfway gone. flames eat at pride, lust. wrath and envy are being consumed. wrath goes last. a man with bloodied hands, in tones of blue. flames devour it.}
<L>__{exterior cemetery day}
<A>__{a field of blue. cops in orderly rows. the funeral of david mills. many police officials and politicians stand in tribute. somerset is here, in his dress blue uniform. he stares forward, still numb, beaten. rifles are raised by a corps of riflemen. blanks explode from the barrels. they reload in unison. somerset looks towards the grace where mills' casket lies under an american flag. tracy is there. tracy stands surrounded by strangers at the grave site. her head is lowered. she cries. each blast of the rifle salute causes her to react with a start.}
<L>__{exterior cemetery later day}
<A>__{the funeral is over. somerset stands at the edge of the graveyard, looking at the distant city. behind him, the mourners are still filing out to their cars. the captain approaches. he comes to stand beside somerset, similarly solemn.}

<A>__{tracy nods. there's nothing left for them to say. they're both empty. it's time for them to give a gesture, a kiss, or a hug, to say goodbye, but neither makes the first move.}

<A>__{sidewalks jammed with people, hurrying. somerset walks in a fog, hands in his pockets. he stops at a corner, but does not cross. he stands there, looks up. at the city around him. the buildings towering over him. at the cars, buses and taxies racing in the streets, blowing their horns and spouting soot. somerset reaches into his jacket pocket, takes out the envelope from john doe. he studies it in his hand.}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{oh... man...}
<A>__{he opens it. he takes out a small note, handwritten. it reads:}
<C>__{plow them under.}
<A>__{somerset looks up again, mortified, fighting to keep control of his emotions. he looks around: at the miserable people, walking past him. at a man at the top of the subway station stairs, sitting in a cardboard box, holding out a cup, rattling the change inside. a father passes by, holding his young son's hand. somerset turns to watch them as they pass. the gather reaches to pick the boy up and carry him. the boy holds tight. for some reason, this makes somerset ache with sorrow. the father hugs his son to him, kisses him on the cheek. the boy returns the kiss, with great affection. somerset watches them disappear in the mass of humanity. he looks back at the note in his hand. he tears the note up, into little pieces.}
<L>__{interior moving truck day}
<A>__{the truck moves along in steady traffic. tracy sits beside the driver. she looks out at the city across the river. she reaches into her pocket, takes out a small manila envelope. she opens the envelope and slides two keys on a keychain out into her palm. she's looking at the keys when she notices something about the envelope. she reopens it, takes out a small folded piece of paper. she unfolds it: it is the piece of wallpaper with the pale rose at its center. she smiles very faintly.}
