<L>__{exterior lifeboat day}
<A>__{a stunning display of clouds and lightning fills the sky, as pi looks on in awe. the sky lights up, a vivid white splinter of lightning crashing down from the sky, puncturing the water near the lifeboat. the water is shot through with what looks like the white roots of an enormous celestial tree; the clap of thunder is tremendous.}
<C>__{pi}
<D>__{praise be to god, lord of all worlds, the compassionate, the merciful!}
<A>__{a wave washes pi off of the tarp and onto the floor of the boat. pi climbs onto the bench. he looks up in wonder at the sky, overwhelmed by the magnificence of the roiling clouds.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{it's beautiful... where are you, richard parker? you have to see this!}
<A>__{another angle: he begins unbuttoning the tarp, calling excitedly to richard parker.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{come out richard parker! come see the hand of god!}
<A>__{pi continues to unfasten the tarp.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{don't hide yourself! he's come to us! it's a miracle!}
<A>__{a huge wave envelopes the lifeboat, submerging the craft completely and then the boat pops to the surface like a cork. pi resumes opening the tarp. he tears it aside, exposing the terrified animal to the storm.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{come out and see god richard parker!}
<A>__{the sky lights up all around them. the tiger begins roaring, pawing at the air, eyes wide, crazed with fear. pi turns to face the storm.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{why are you scaring him! i've lost my family i've lost everything! i surrender! what more do you want?}
<A>__{a wave washes pi overboard, and the raft comes crashing down on top of the lifeboat, then slides away. pi climbs back on board. he lies on the bench, coming to his senses, realizing the extent of the danger they face. he sees richard parker cowering miserably at the stern.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{i'm sorry richard parker!}
<A>__{pi crawls to the bow in time to see the raft, no longer tied to the lifeboat, drifting away. pounded by rain and surf, he works his way around the edge of the boat, re hooking the tarp to tarp hooks. with only four left unfastened along one side, he pulls himself under the tarp.}
