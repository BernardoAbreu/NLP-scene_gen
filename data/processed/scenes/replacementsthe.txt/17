<L>__{interior redskins' head coach's office day}
<A>__{mcginty is sitting behind the empty desk as his two main coaches give him a presentation. they are offensive coordinator leo pilachowski and defensive coordinator}
<B>__{christopher banes.}
<C>__{pilachowski}
<D>__{... six phone lines with internet access on two: one for defense and one for offense.}
<C>__{banes}
<D>__{we thought we would skip special teams for the moment.}
<C>__{pilachowski}
<D>__{except for a kicker. we definitely need a kicker. a place kicker over a punter.}
<C>__{banes}
<D>__{the thinking being that if we lose the toss, we have to be able to at least kick off.}
<A>__{both coaches laugh nervously. mcginty doesn't say anything.}
<C>__{pilachowski}
<D>__{okay. here's the list of every player cut this past season. what we would like to do is... mcginty}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{those people?}
<P>__{(pointing to list)}
<D>__{most of them were cut because they were shitty.}
<A>__{mcginty takes out a piece of paper of his own with a bunch of names on it.}
<D>__{mcginty we're going to go another way here. i've done some scouting since i retired. on an ad hoc basis, of course. and what i have here is a list of people i've kept an eye on. they've all played football somewhere, but only a few in the pros. and they've all got something... unique to bring to the game. we're gonna take these people and try to put together a winning team. and if nothing else, they should be fun to watch.}
<A>__{mcginty looks up when he senses someone standing in the doorway. it's reese evans, the veteran redskin we saw standing on the sidelines with the clean uniform.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{you won't need a center. mcginty how you doin', reese?}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{bored and ready to retire. i'm just looking for one more hit. one more really good hit. mcginty what about the strike?}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{hell, i'm rich. i got no complaint with mister o'neil. i just want a chance to play one last time.}
<C>__{evans }
<D>__{shit, i'd rather go out with a broken leg than sitting on the bench.}
<A>__{mcginty nods to pilachowski. the coach takes a marker and fills in "evans" in the center circle.}
<D>__{mcginty welcome to the new washington redskins.}
<P>__{(to his coaches)}
<D>__{let's find reese somebody to play with.}
