<L>__{exterior afghan desert day}
<A>__{silence. smoke rises from a crater that was once the fort. the doors of the truck creak open. most of the youngsters giggle. fun ride. as the guys help them out:}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{yeah, that was great, wasn't it? my favorite part was when we were completely on fire. what was yours?}
<A>__{sounds of a blackhawk chopper approaching...}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{exfil incoming. how are we gonna explain the kids, colonel?}
<A>__{clay doesn't seem to hear him.}
<C>__{pooch }
<D>__{colonel?}
<P>__{(clay looks up)}
<D>__{the kids. what do we tell 'em?}
<A>__{a beat. clay seems to shake off his daze as the blackhawk sets down. walking up to the chopper:}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{lieutenant, you're to evac these civvies to the firebase immediately }
<C>__{blackhawk pilot}
<D>__{negative, our orders are to transport a five man team only.}
<A>__{clay's eyes dart down to the pilot's neck. a silver crucifix hangs around it. clay, softer:}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you really want to leave twenty three kids in the desert to die?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{blackhawk pilot}
<D>__{not enough room for them and you...}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{then it's them.}
<A>__{the pilot nods. our guys begin loading the kids on...}
<C>__{jensen}
<A>__{clay helps omar on last. the kid looks at him. he knows perfectly well what clay saved him from in that basement.}
<C>__{omar}
<A>__{clay nods. a beat. the pilot pulls the stick back and the chopper ascends. the kids wave goodbye to our guys. omar, holding clay's gaze as they rise. only broken as the chopper begins to recede into the distance. the last clay sees of him is that ratty little teddy bear...}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{cute little buggers. hope they can make it to our court martial.}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{relax, pooch, we're not going to be court martialed if anything, we're going to die of thirst wandering the desert, right colonel?}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(ignores this)}
<D>__{jensen, see if you can cut into that blackhawk's chatter i want to know if he rats us out.}
<A>__{as jensen tunes his radio...}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{so, how we getting back? hitchhike? magic carpet? i say magic carpet...}
<C>__{roque}
<P>__{(noticing)}
<D>__{guess they hustled up some air support after all that's a pakistani mig up there...}
<A>__{jensen's tuning into the mig's frequency. looking nervous.}
