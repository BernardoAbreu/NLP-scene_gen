<L>__{interior apartment night}
<A>__{in her crib mary is sleeping. she's beautiful, she looks happy.}
<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{mary is in her playpen, playing with a squeaky rubber giraffe. the doorbell rings. peter opens it: standing there before him is a very, very, young, gorgeous girl.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(bursting with joy)}
<D>__{hello... i'm sylvia, mary's mother. i've come to get her...}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(completely dazed)}
<D>__{oh, it's you... wait, i will go get jack...}
<A>__{he stands there, frozen.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{how's mary doing?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(as if he were dreaming)}
<D>__{fine, fine, she's doing great... she's getting her back teeth in lately, it's been a bit rough...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{can i see her?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh, yeah, sure, she's in there...}
<A>__{they both enter the living room. mary stares at sylvia. when she spots mary, sylvia suddenly breaks down in tears. peter is dumbfounded.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{i don't believe how much she's grown!}
<A>__{recovering, wiping away her tears, she walks over to the playpen.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{hello, mary, hello my darling...}
<A>__{she picks her up, hugs her tightly, showers kisses on her. mary laughs. sylvia starts crying again.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{how beautiful she is... her hair has grown... look how much she changed, i missed it all. i missed her so much!}
<A>__{peter, in a kind of daze, stares at sylvia. without looking at peter, she dries her eyes and tries to stop crying.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{i wanted to make life difficult for jack but i never thought i'd miss her so much...}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(still in a fog)}
<D>__{oh, yeah... make life difficult for jack...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{is he here?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{is jack here?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(snapping out of it)}
<D>__{oh, yeah, yeah, i will go get him...}
<A>__{he exits like a sleepwalker and goes straight into michael's room. the latter is asleep. peter sits down on the edge of michael's bed and gently shakes him.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{michael, michael... sylvia's here.}
<A>__{michael wakes up and looks at peter.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{mary's leaving.}
