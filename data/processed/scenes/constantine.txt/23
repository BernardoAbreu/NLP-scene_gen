<A>__{hennessey follows john down the spiraling stairs, passing the gathered tenants. a few are freaked, cross themselves. others horrified. but many want to touch them, shake their hands. a shadowy figure several floors up stares over the rail at the heroes below. note the slick suit, the polished veneer. this is balthazar and he definitely does not rent here. he flicks an ancient coin between his fingers. john pauses, gazes up through the stairwell as if sensing something. no one there. balthazar is gone. john shakes off the feeling, continues down the steps where hennessey is shoving his hat in front of the tenants. they're gladly giving to the cause.}
