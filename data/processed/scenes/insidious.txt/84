<L>__{interior classroom, forrester high school night}
<A>__{a darkened class room. an older janitor, ned (68), shoulders the door open, carrying a mop. he starts when he sees josh, sitting at his desk in the pale light of a desk lamp. alone.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{josh...didn't see you there.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{sorry to scare you.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{what are you up to this late?}
<A>__{josh holds up his flask of whisky. he's a bit soused.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{where did all the bartenders who listen to your troubles go, ned?}
<A>__{ned nods sagely. he sets down his mop and grabs a chair, sitting in front of josh with a sigh. he takes the flask.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{never drink alone. if you take the dirty jokes out of drunkenness, all you're left with is the self loathing.}
<A>__{he downs a hit from the flask, then hands it back.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{i don't need whisky for that.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{bah. you people think too much. used to be, if life threw a shitstorm at you, you'd grab the nearest umbrella. your generation would spend a day googling what brand to buy.}
<A>__{josh laughs despite himself.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{i probably would too.}
<P>__{(beat; takes a drink)}
<D>__{it's funny, i've always known i was the type of person that things didn't happen to. i made peace with it. i thought to myself, it's okay i will never win the lottery or climb mount everest...but i will never get a rare tropical blood disease either. it works out.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now i'm the guy whose son is in a mysterious coma.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{things happen to everybody. even to good people like you. and they're gonna keep happening the older you get, believe me. no use sittin' in the dark drinkin' over it. go home. be with your wife. tell her your what's on your mind.}
<A>__{he takes the flask and has another swig.}
<C>__{ned }
<D>__{there sure as hell isn't any umbrellas `round here.}
