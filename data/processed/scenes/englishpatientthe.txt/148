<L>__{132a. exterior monastery olive groves. day.}
<A>__{hana sees kip barely visible standing at the far perimeter of the garden in the olive groves, his hands raised above him, his leg held out strangely. wires run from his foot in all directions as if he'd trodden in some elaborate steel cobweb.}
<L>__{exterior monastery olive groves. day.}
<A>__{hana appears at the edge of the olive groves and hurries towards kip, who hasn't moved. he shouts warning her.}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{go to the left! keep to the left! there are mines and trip wires everywhere!}
<A>__{hana stops, hoists up her skirt and circles left, tentative in the long grass. he shouts, doesn't want her close.}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{get hardy. he's on the other side of town. in the hills. get him to hurry.}
<A>__{she keeps coming, can see that he needs her.}
<C>__{hana}
<D>__{it's okay i will help. please.}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{the mines, the wires, there's a trick. some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.}
<C>__{hana}
<D>__{what do i do?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{there's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, i think at least to give me a chance. i have to work out which one to cut before i fall over.}
<C>__{hana}
<D>__{so i follow the wires?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{you get hardy.}
<C>__{hana}
<D>__{i follow the wires.}
<A>__{she kneels at his feet and tries to trace the tangled route of the web.}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{don't touch them.}
<A>__{she follows one wire back to the closest mine, and traces another back to kip's foot. then she finds another one leading off to a second mine some thirty metres away.}
<C>__{hana}
<D>__{why would anyone do this?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{i've done this. i've had to do this. then hana's suddenly tense.}
<C>__{hana}
<D>__{give me a second.}
<A>__{she turns and tiptoes right through the danger area, straight to what had seized her attention. kip is appalled.}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{what are you doing?! hana!}
<A>__{heedless, she dodges another mine and its web of wires just as the tortoise clambers onto a clump of rock, which is, in fact, another concrete covered mine. hana snatches him up as he ambles towards the metal. she turns, holding the protesting animal in triumph. her foot snags on a wire. she has to ease it off, in arabesque, still clutching the tortoise. she goes sideways to the safe zone setting down the animal. then she's back with kip. he's seething. she is strangely elated.}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{what is this business with you and explosives? do you think you're immune?}
<C>__{hana}
<D>__{i promise you that was the right thing to do. he's my good luck.}
<P>__{(she gets the pliers from his belt,}
<A>__{and hands them to him)}
<D>__{now cut. this one.}
<P>__{(she indicates the wire)}
<D>__{i hope we don't die.}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{okay. get away from here. quick.}
<C>__{hana}
<D>__{i'm not scared. so many people have died around me. but i would be a shame for us.}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i don't feel like being shy.}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{you must get away. before i cut. i'm not cutting if you're here.}
<A>__{he's struggling. he's going to topple over if he cuts.}
<C>__{hana}
<D>__{actually, you can't cut, can you? you'll fall over. give me the pliers.}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{but he hands them over.}
<C>__{hana}
<D>__{kiss me. before i cut. just in case.}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{don't talk. check again. lie flat and then cut.}
<A>__{hana checks, lies down. he bends as close to the ground as he dares and kisses her, then she immediately cuts.}
