<L>__{exterior forest night}
<A>__{darkness. the sound of battle cries and the clang of metal upon metal. the forest lights up with huge sparks flying from sword and ax as armored knights hack and swing at each other. mounted knights collide head on at full gallop, their armor made incandescent in the clash. sparks eddy in their wakes and float to the ground. the forest catches fire. main titles on the flames. out of the sounds of ancient battle grows music, heroic and barbaric, shot through with melancholy. two crazed eyes reflect the fire. the eyes belong to a man without age, at once ancient and boyish, female and male; his eyes are pained from the burden of too much knowledge. so close is he to the flames that a lock of his wild hair sizzles alight. he slaps at the fire as if it were an annoying insect. he wears a cloak of black trimmed with silver. it is merlin. the wizard weaves a path through the burning forest, dodging the combatants, searching.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{lord uther! lord uther!}
<A>__{the forest around him weeps softly with the sounds that follow slaughter. patches of undergrowth are smoldering. small flames lick bark and branches. smoke floats through the trees and hovers over the bodies of the dying and the dead. a huge knight reins up beside merlin on a lathered horse. his armor is blood spattered. he is weary from battle. he looks down at merlin, his countenance fierce. the blade of his sword glows with an unnatural aura.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{it's done. a truce. we meet at the river.}
<C>__{uther}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{talk. lovers murmuring to each other...}
<L>__{exterior river, forest day}
<A>__{waiting on one bank of a small river that flows through the forest is a warlord, the duke of cornwall. he is flanked by his armored warriors. lot of lowthean prominent among them. they are battle weary and bloodied, but they look ready to fight. behind them is an army of lesser knights. to the opposite bank come uther and merlin, a much smaller force of knights, including uryens, lord of gore, surrounding them.}
<C>__{duke of cornwall}
<D>__{i spit on your truce, uther. if you want peace, throw down your swords.}
<A>__{uther and the duke of cornwall glare at each other in silence across the river. uther strains forward, burning with anger; but merlin restrains him.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{i should butcher all and every one of them. merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{just show the sword.}
<A>__{uther unsheathes his mighty sword, and brandishes it in the air high over his head. the blade hums disquietingly and leaves a lingering electric hue upon the air. the marvel instills dread in all present.}

<P>__{(waxing eloquent)}
<D>__{behold the sword of power, excalibur. before uther, it belonged to lud, before lud, to beowulf, before beowulf to baldur the good, before baldur to thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.}

<D>__{speak the words.}
<C>__{uther}
<P>__{(bellowing)}
<D>__{one land, one king! that is my peace!}

<A>__{drums and wailing flutes fill the banquet hall with a lusty rhythm. armored warriors watch a lone woman dancing. she is very beautiful, both sensuous and innocent. uther sits at the long table beside the duke of cornwall with the barons and dukes of the land, and the lesser knights. the table is stained with wine and littered with bones and half eaten fruit. uther's eyes burn with lust as he watches the dancer.}
<C>__{duke of cornwall}
<D>__{i would wish you such a wife, lord uther, as my igrayne. so innocent, but in bed, a furnace...}
<A>__{the duke rises and goes to his wife, be striding the center of the hall and igrayne weaves circles of dance around him. he gloats with pride. the words escape his lips:}

<C>__{lot}
<D>__{and risk all you've won? this castle commands the sea gate to the kingdom.}
<A>__{uther is not one for politics, and lot's words sail past him. the king lusts for igrayne. a bell is struck not far away. the music ceases and the hall falls silent. the great door creaks open, revealing the dawn light, and a monk steps into the hall and waits by it. muffled by corridors of stone, a choir of monks can now be heard singing the high, ecstatic harmonies of the te deum. those who have fallen asleep at the table are roused, those drunk, helped up.}
<L>__{interior passageway, tintagel castle dawn}
<A>__{the monk leads the party down the hallway of the castle. thin shafts of dawnlight filter through archers' slits in the thick walls onto stone floors. otherwise, it is dark. each person, lady and knight, proceeds alone, head bent, some crossing themselves. uther is among them. he stops in a dark alcove, breathing heavily, waiting. as the lovely igrayne drifts past him, he pulls her out of sight of the others. in a shaft of pale light uther clasps igrayne to his breastplate, his iron arm wrapped around her frail body. so violent is his embrace that she cannot breathe, her mouth is wide with fear, and her feet do not touch the ground; an impaled butterfly.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{you will be mine. wife and queen, bed and crown.}
<A>__{his face is close to hers, looking as though he would devour her tender whiteness with his kiss. she doesn't answer; she can't. even uther understands this and lets her go.}

<P>__{(a fierce whisper)}
<D>__{i want no other crown and no other bed than those i have.}

<L>__{exterior war camp before tintagel castle day}
<A>__{uther is in a towering rage. sword drawn, he stalks among the biers of fallen knights. squires and clerics keep a healthy distance. the sky is lowering, pregnant with rolling thunder. beyond his encampment, high on a cliff rising out of the sea stands the impregnable tintagel castle, seat of the duke of cornwall, now under siege.}
<C>__{uther}
<P>__{(bellowing in all directions)}
<D>__{merlin! where are you!?}
<A>__{just then a knight rides up and dismounts. it is ulfius, a lieutenant.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{have you found him?}
<C>__{ulfius}
<D>__{no }
<A>__{but he cannot finish. he is taken aback by the sudden appearance of a hideous hag who approaches, rattling a beggar's pan.}
<C>__{hag}
<D>__{what a hurry you were in this morning, good sir. you forgot to give this old woman a coin.}
<C>__{ulfius}
<D>__{i saw you half a day's gallop from here. i asked you if you had seen merlin. i returned here straight away. how did }
<C>__{hag}
<D>__{ i heard. i have come. i am also merlin.}
<A>__{the figure straightens, the filthy rags become a flowing cape, and the hair is swept back by the wind, andoit is merlin, laughing.}

<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{dumb riddles, merlin. i am your king.}
<A>__{ulfius edges away.}
<C>__{merlin}

<A>__{the duke of cornwall under siege. all this for lust. selfish lust. uther grabs merlin.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{for igrayne. one night with her. do it. use the magic.}
<A>__{merlin frowns pensively, his gaze searching strange distances and wandering; then focusing, blazing straight at uther.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{you will swear by your true kingship to grant me what i wish. then you shall have it.}
<A>__{uther kneels and draws his sword and holds it up by the blade, a cross.}

<A>__{the duke of cornwall watches a force of armored knights riding forth from uther's war camp, with banners flying. it passes beneath the castle and on toward a distant cliff.}
<C>__{duke of cornwall}
<P>__{(to a lieutenant)}

<A>__{his eyes are as cold and as pale as ice.}
<L>__{exterior cliff above the sea twilight}
<A>__{uther and his knights, and merlin on a mule, ride to the high promontory and dismount. here, overlooking the sea, is a circle of ancient stones, carved with strange runes and hieroglyphics, and as the wind moves through them it moans and sighs. the knights watch as merlin and uther, leading his horse, walk toward the stones. merlin strides into the circle, turning to look at uther, who hesitates.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{come.}
<A>__{uther starts to make the sign of the cross, but merlin halts him with a gesture. uther's hand drops, and he enters the circle with his horse. merlin and uther look out across the sea, to tintagel castle high upon the cliff. merlin solemnly raises his arms toward that distant castle, and chants in an ancient language, the sounds of which he marries to the roaring and whining of the wind. the wind becomes stronger, and merlin's incantations become more intense, and the wind in turn becomes wilder still. until merlin is charged with a fierce, nonhuman power, as the wind buffets his slight frame. and then, for all to understand:}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{i hold the balance of all things in my summoning. arise mists. come fog.}

<D>__{ride straight to the castle, across the sea of fog.}

<C>__{uther}
<D>__{but the cliff, the sea...}
<A>__{merlin rages, crazed.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{ride across! across the bridges of desire. your lust will hold you up. for i have just woven it into the fabric of the world. this is magic making solid what is in the mind, and unsolid, that which is already solid.}
<A>__{he gives the horse a stinging blow with his staff. the horse and uther charge forward into a gallop and stepping off where the hidden edge of the cliff would be, hoofbeats ceasing and the horse dropping for the blink of an eye, they gallop across the fog.}
<L>__{exterior merlin's fog}
<A>__{galloping on no visible terrain, uther and his horse advance through the restless fog, and as they recede rider and animal become a wavering, changeable form within the cloud.}

<C>__{rider}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{wake up in there. it is i.}
<A>__{if it was not for the electric blue hue burning in the eyes of the man entering the castle, the same magic hue that excalibur left upon the air when wielded, the resemblance to the duke if cornwall would be perfect. after a moment the portal opens.}

<A>__{he passes into an inner court, the portal closing behind. armed men emerge cautiously. thinking that it is their duke they help him dismount.}

<A>__{the real duke and his men ride through the fogbound camp, cutting the ropes of the tents, stabbing the men trapped beneath the canvas. when a frightened crow flies squawking into the face of the duke's horse, which rears. he is unhorsed and falls, and impales himself on a tent stake. dying, the true lord of tintagel castle rises and staggers forward, blood pumping from him.}

<A>__{in full armor, the 'duke' bears down on the naked igrayne on her marriage bed. she stares at him, wondering. but his eyes are closed, and finally he carries her in his wild passion, her white limbs tangling around the lustre of his armor.}
<L>__{exterior cliff above the sea night}
<A>__{and merlin is jolted awake from deep within himself, coming out of a trance.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{it is done. the future has found root in the present.}
<A>__{he lifts himself up on his staff. he stands in the midst of the ancient stones, bristling with excitement. uther's mighty knights are asleep, a deep unnatural sleep, huddled together and surrounded by their horses. and then merlin swoons, collapsing to the ground.}
<L>__{interior hall, tintagel castle dawn}
<A>__{his lieutenants deposit the duke of cornwall's bloodless body upon the long table. his eyes are wide open, icy and cunning even in death. the ladies of the castle support and comfort the grief stricken igrayne as she approaches the body of her husband. morgana hangs onto her mother's gown.}

<C>__{igrayne}
<D>__{his spirit?}
<A>__{pale with grief, igrayne stares at her dead husband in silence. then her hand drifts to her stomach. when she talks again, undone and resolved, it is to all and herself:}
<C>__{igrayne}
<D>__{tintagel castle falls to uther. but what shall become of me, and the child i bear?}
<A>__{morgana shows no distress. she runs her baby hands across her father's face and closes his eyes. the intensity that was frozen in them is now added to her own pale and cunning eyes.}
<L>__{exterior cliff above the sea day}
<A>__{merlin has been propped up against one of the stones. he is in a deep trance and uther is attempting to shake him awake.}

<A>__{the ladies slip past him to the door, and he goes up to igrayne.}

<C>__{uther}
<D>__{igrayne, is he mine, or }
<A>__{he can't bring himself to say his name. she hesitates on the edge of tears, worried for the infant lying in its iron cradle.}
<C>__{igrayne}
<D>__{the night he died, a man loved me with great fierceness. he looked like my husband, spoke like, smelled like, felt like my own husband. but it was not he, for he was already dead. it wasn't his spirit, for this child, who was conceived that night, is flesh and blood. i know nothing more.}
<A>__{uther draws a dagger. he lifts it.}
<C>__{igrayne}
<D>__{no }
<A>__{but he uses it before igrayne can move. he severs the leather thongs that bind the iron breastplate to his chest. he casts it to the floor. his chest is smooth and milk white in striking contrast to his creased, weathered face. and beaming, he holds the baby to it.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{through him, i will learn to love them, for i am tired of battle. i will stay by his side and}
<P>__{(looking shyly at igrayne)}

<C>__{uther}
<D>__{here. it's hungry.}
<A>__{and his free hand opens her shift, and he holds a swollen breast in his gloved hand, squeezing gently. milk bubbles from it and he thrusts the baby's mouth onto it. igrayne weeps and uther watches proudly as the baby suckles. merlin advances from the window, his cape the same iridescent green black as the feathers of the crows that were perched by the window.}

<D>__{merlin! out of the sick sleep at last.}
<C>__{merlin}

<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{they are not weapons, my friend, but truths. you betrayed the duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. lot, uryens, your allies will turn against you. give me the child, uther, i will protect him. go back to your war tent.}

<D>__{by the oath, take the devil child. take him!}
<A>__{with the bawling baby under his cape, merlin exits. igrayne pulls herself out of the bed, weak, her legs giving under her. she starts after merlin.}

<A>__{merlin comes across the empty banquet hall, cooing to the baby, strangely pacifying him. morgana steps out of the shadows in his path, and merlin stops at the sight of the little girl, her pale eyes glaring at him. she speaks haltingly and clearly while far off igrayne cries out her distress.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{merlin, are you now the father, and the mother, of the baby?}

<A>__{the forest is dark and shiny with rain. an unseen battle rages. the first combatant in sight is uther, who swings the mighty excalibur, cutting an attacker in half at the waist. uther and a small force of knights, ulfius among them, are retreating through the slippery wet forest, completely outnumbered. lord lot of lowthean and lord uryens of gore are the leaders of the attack.}

<A>__{uther staggers away, colliding with trees, staggering, crashing to the ground. until the only life left in him is the coursing of his blood, flowing from his gaping mouth onto the leaves on the forest floor. the enemy knights advance through the trees. they prod at the fallen leviathan, they roll him over to get at his scabbard. only then do they see the sword in the stone, and they stop, amazed and afraid. their captains appear. uryens sees what they are staring at, and races to the sword and attempts to pull it out. he strains with all his might, but it is immovable.}

<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{good day to you, sir.}
<C>__{arthur}

<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{then may he give me the strength to unhorse you and send you with one blow back across the sea.}
<A>__{arthur wheels away, trembling with anger, and gallops to his edge of the field. he sees that lancelot has already positioned himself and is waiting, lance down. merlin watches, a spectator, as the two charge at each other. they collide with great force, their spears shattering. arthur is jolted but stays in the saddle. lancelot's jousting is impeccable. arthur draws excalibur.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{hold! i offer you another lance.}
<A>__{pages come forward with new lances for arthur and lancelot.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{you joust well, sir. battle learnt, but tournament fancy. you should ride more forward in the saddle, though.}
<A>__{arthur grabs the spear from the page's hands, and circles back to work the horse up into an all out gallop. lancelot spurs forward to meet him. arthur is neatly unhorsed. he picks himself up from the ground in a rage, drawing excalibur. lancelot on his horse weaves circles around him.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{yield. i have the advantage.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i will not.}

<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{i sought only not to harm you, sir.}
<A>__{he dismounts and draws his sword, and they clash. shield and sword and armor against shield and sword and armor. the swordplay is furious, arthur attacking, slashing, hacking, lancelot parrying effortlessly, elegantly defensive. arthur breaks the onslaught to catch his breath. lancelot lifts his visor. his eyes are calm, laughing.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{sir, your rage has unbalanced you. it seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so be it, to the death.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{it is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must.}
<A>__{arthur goes forward attacking with terrible blows upon lancelot's shield, and lancelot holds his ground, shield high. and in its mirror like metal arthur can see his own reflection, a face distorted by uncontrolled passion. arthur discards his own shield, grabs excalibur with both hands, and with a frightening shout that speaks of all his rage, he swings a terrific blow upon the shield, cutting through his own reflection and the metal. and excalibur snaps in two. a blinding blue green light explodes from the broken sword. lancelot, knocked back by the force of the blow, is stunned by the blast and falls to the ground unconscious. arthur backs away, horrified, half of excalibur in his hand.}

<A>__{merlin stands there, drawn, defeated, his hopes dead.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i have lost for all time the ancient sword of my fathers whose power was meant to unite all men, to serve the vanity of a single man.}
<A>__{despairing, he flings the two parts of excalibur into the pool. he kneels at the waters edge, and he cries.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i am nothing.}
<A>__{then arthur sees something that startles him. beneath the surface, suspended in the blue green water amid the dancing weeds, he sees excalibur, intact. it is held by a maiden in flowing gown the color of water, her long hair rippling across her face, obscuring it.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{excalibur! is it true?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{the lady of the lake. take it. take it, quickly!}
<A>__{arthur dips his hand under the water and grasps the hilt and the moment he does the vision in the blue green water fades. he rises with excalibur in hand, and merlin speaks before arthur can ask the question.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{there are infinite worlds within the infinite coils of the dragon. in one of them, which i have not traveled, the sword was forged. i only know that the king is returned to us through the instrument of his power. the game continues!}
<A>__{and he laughs. just then lancelot stirs. arthur rushes to his side. he loosens his helmet and removes it, uncovering damp curls. the young knight's eyes open, and his laughing charm once more animates his face.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{thanks to god, you are alive.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<P>__{(sitting up)}
<D>__{i, the best knight in the world, bested! this is a great day, for my search is over. i love you, my king.}

<D>__{you are still the best knight in christiandom. you gained a hundred advantages over me. it is i who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{then make me your champion and i will always fight in your place.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{but your life and lands are far from here.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{i gave up my castles and my lands!}
<A>__{he thumps his breastplate.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{my domain is here, inside this metal skin. and i would pledge to you all that i still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{and a great heart it is. sir lancelot, you will be my champion.}
<A>__{lancelot draws his sword, holding it by the blade, a crucifix.}

<C>__{knight}
<D>__{...we killed every one of them. burnt their ship...}
<A>__{arthur sees lancelot in the throng and moves toward him. merlin follows arthur and is pushed and knocked around in the crush of spikes and iron. the only unarmored man in the crowd, he glares at the excited knights irritably.}

<C>__{lancelot}

<C>__{knight}
<D>__{let me through. i fought the king's battle too. he must know my story.}
<A>__{merlin is brutally jostled. he draws a fistful of powder from his cape and he tosses it into the air above him. he raises his staff into the cloud, cracking it like a whip. the tip of the staff catches fire, and the fire spreads through the powder in the air, stunning all into silence. merlin shouts and snarls.}

<A>__{he backs away from the water and hides the sword in the reeds, and starts back.}
<L>__{exterior moors by the sea evening}
<A>__{perceval dismounts, rushing to kneel at the king's side. arthur looks up, calm and intense.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{when you threw it in, what did you see?}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{...i saw nothing.}
<A>__{the king looks at him with piercing power. perceval blurts it out.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{my king, i couldn't do it. excalibur cannot be lost. other men }
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{ by itself it is only a piece of steel. its power comes from he who wields it. for now there is no one. do as i have ordered!}
<A>__{perceval leaves once more. the daylight is failing, the sun is near the horizon over the sea, bursting through clouds.}
<L>__{exterior pool evening}
<A>__{he picks up the sword and looks at it for a long time. finally, with great misgiving, he hurls it into the middle of the pool. as excalibur is about to touch the water a woman's hand reaches and grasps it by the hilt. it holds the sword aloft for a moment and then draws it under. perceval backs away from the pool stunned by the marvel.}
<L>__{exterior moors by the sea sunset}
<A>__{perceval returns to the king, terribly excited, shouting from his horse:}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{arthur!}
<A>__{but arthur isn't there. perceval looks around him, he doesn't understand. he sees a trail of blood. he spurs his horse and follows the trail down to the sea.}
<L>__{exterior beach sunset then night}
<A>__{there is a trail of blood and prints upon the sand left by a man crawling. perceval follows them toward the sea. he looks around, searching, terribly distraught. where the blood and prints cease, there are many footprints coming from and returning into the sea. perceval looks out across the waves. he sees a sailing vessel rising on the swell. on its deck he can make out the distant figure of arthur, lying surrounded by women, their gossamer robes rippling in the wind. the sun hovers on the horizon and the ship is heading for it. he gallops into the waves until his horse will go no further, calling out with all his strength, a futile attempt:}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{arthur! will you return?}
<A>__{the sun slips below the horizon. night is falling, and the wind whips the wavecrests. he turns from the sea and wades back.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{all the knights of the round table are dead. excalibur is returned. arthur is gone. maybe he lives, maybe he will return...}
<A>__{he stops at the edge of the water. in the uncertain light sky and sea become one. he draws the chalice out of a pouch on his saddle, and he holds it up before him.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{only i remain, and this...}
<A>__{the wind swirls and whistles mysteriously in the hollow of the cup. music grand and melancholic grows from it. the chalice, etched in starlight, is the last thing that is taken from sight in the enfolding darkness.}
