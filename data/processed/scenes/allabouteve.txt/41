<L>__{interior margo's dressing room night}
<A>__{bill faces eve, who wears margo's costume. she is a ravishing sight. her eyes shine up to his radiantly:}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ little things here and there, it doesn't matter. you can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{are you proud of me, bill?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i will admit i was worried when max called. i had my doubts.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you shouldn't have had any doubts.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{ after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. but you did it. with work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. if that's what you want to be.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{is that what you want me to be?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'm talking about you. and what you want.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{so am i.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what have i got to do with it?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{everything.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(lightly)}
<D>__{the names i've been called. but never svengali.}
<P>__{(he pats her shoulder)}
<D>__{good luck.}
<A>__{he starts out. addison ducks.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{don't run away, bill.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(stops)}
<D>__{from what would i be running?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you're always after truth on the stage. what about off?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(curiously)}
<D>__{i'm for it.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{then face it. i have. since that first night here in the dressing room.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{when i told you what every young actress should know.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{when you told me that whatever i became, it would be because of you }
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{your make up's a little heavy.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{ and for you.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{you're quite a girl.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you think?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'm in love with margo. hadn't you heard?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you hear all kinds of things.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'm only human, rumors to the contrary. and i'm as curious as the next man...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{find out.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(deliberately)}
<D>__{only thing, what i go after, i want to go after. i don't want it to come after me.}
<A>__{tears come to eve's eyes. she turns away slowly.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{don't cry. just score it as an incomplete forward pass.}
<A>__{he walks out. addison ducks to avoid being seen. eve glares after bill, tears the wig from her head, throws it on the dressing table. her glance is caught by a pair of scissors. swiftly, she snatches them up and in a sharp, vicious gesture she slashes the wig. addison knocks politely at the door. eve turns.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{may i come in?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{certainly, mr. dewitt...}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(entering)}
<D>__{i expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.}
<A>__{she starts creaming her face, removing make up.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{of course your performance was no surprise to me. after the other day i regarded it as no more than a promised fulfilled.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you're more than kind. but it's still miss channing's performance. i'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{you're more than modest.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{it's not modesty. i just don't try to kid myself.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{a revolutionary approach to the theater. however, if i may a suggestion...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{please do.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{i think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. it is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i don't think i've done anything to sound off about.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{we all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. if we don't blow them who will?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{even so. one isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. it'll be forgotten tomorrow.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{it needn't be.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{even if i wanted to as you say be less humble, blow my own horn... how would i do it? i'm less than nobody.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{i am somebody.}
<A>__{eve rises. she eyes him steadily.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you certainly are.}
<A>__{she goes into the bathroom.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{leave the door open a bit, so we can talk.}
<A>__{eve does so.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{after you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(from the bathroom)}
<D>__{i'd love to! or should i pretend i'm busy?}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{let's have a minimum of pretending. i will want to do a column about you }
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i'm not enough for a paragraph.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{ perhaps more than one. there's so much i want to know. i've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to margo it started in san francisco, didn't it?}
<P>__{(no answer; addison smiles)}
<D>__{i say your idolatry of margo started in san francisco, didn't it?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{san francisco. an oasis of civilization in the california desert. tell me, do you share my high opinion of san francisco?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{yes. i do.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{and that memorable night when margo first dazzled you from the stage which theater was it in san francisco? was it the shubert?}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(a slight pause)}
<D>__{yes. the shubert.}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(grins happily)}
<D>__{a fine old theater, the shubert. full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake so sorry fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{eddie...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{eddie what?}
<A>__{eve sticks her head and naked shoulder around the door.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i'm about to go into the shower, i won't be able to hear you...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{i can wait. where would you like to go? we'll make this a special night...}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(trustingly)}
<D>__{you take charge.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{i believe i will.}
<A>__{she closes the door. he leans back, lights a cigarette.}
