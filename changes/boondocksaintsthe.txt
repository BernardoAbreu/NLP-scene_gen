<ACTION_ALT>__{DOWNTOWN BOSTON}
<ACTION>__{As we open we see the inside of an enormous church. A young looking PRIEST in his mid-thirties is finishing the delivery of the Lords Prayer. In the back of the church, in the last pew, there are two who kneel on the cold, stone floor. They do not stand to sing, nor do they offer signs of peace when told, but they pray. They grip and rub their rosaries. They mutter their words in Latin. CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (mid-twenties) are shrouded in thick waist length navy P-coats, worn leather boots and the hungry clothes of the poor. The boys heads are shaved and they have facial hair.}

<ACTION>__{Macklepenny takes his seat on the alter along side the regular priests of the church. The MacManus brothers suddenly stand, as all others remain seated. Each church goer between them and the aisle shifts his/her position to allow the boys passage, as if on command. The two turn and begin to stride for the alter, eyes down, determined.}

And I always knew that one day they would do something of true greatness. I just never expected they would bring about such a... such a reckoning.}
<ACTION>__{The MacManus brothers are fraternal twins. As Annabelle MacManus speaks, Macklepenny is taken aback as he scans the congregation amazed to find that he is the only one who thinks this out of the ordinary. The monsignor begins his sermon. Macklepenny rises to stop the boys from this disgraceful disturbance. The elder clergyman finds Macklepenny's arm, keeping him seated while shaking his head. Macklepenny's confusion gives way to awe as he watches the brothers step onto the altar, brush by the six seated priests, and approach the enormous crucifix. They both fall to their knees and kiss the feet of Christ. They rise and as abruptly as they came, they turn and head back down the aisle for the front door. They stop at the rear of the church, turning to listen to the sermon.}

Nobody wanted to take a stand... We must fear evil men and deal with them accordingly but what we must truly guard against, what we must fear most}

Vladdy has a large bandage around his head. The boys stand in surprise. Ivan smashes Connor in the forehead with his gun, sending blood gushing down his face as he falls to the floor. Murphy helplessly yells his brother's name as he is brought to his knees by Vladdy. Ivan positions Connor on his knees before the toilet, which is open to the room. Checkov puts his foot on Connor's head and proceeds, as he struggles, to hand cuff him to the old toilet.

His gun discharges firing a hole in the brick of the opposing wall. He is savagely crushed against the ground. Connor bounces off and hits the wall, landing in the garbage completely unconscious. Murphy takes his hands from his head. There is dead silence. He runs to his brother, pulls him from the trash and checks his vital signs. He seems okay. Vladdy, still alive, slowly crawls for his gun, inadvertently covering his own bullet casing. Murphy goes over, picks up the tank cover and clubs the man to death with two hard and fast blows, then throws it up and behind him. It lands in the dumpster with a resonating boom.

<ACTION>__{He takes Smecker into a small bathroom adjoining the foyer. They are instantly in the throws of passion. They grope each other and Smecker cleverly avoids any contact with his crotch. Smecker lies down on the floor and starts to wiggle and seductively touch himself. Geno stands over him, straddling Smecker's hips as he undoes his pants. Suddenly, Smecker grabs both of Geno's ankles and has him locked in position. He repeatedly kicks Geno in the balls from his lying position on the floor. The guy falls on his back unconscious. Smecker uses a silencer, shoots him in the head.}

He thoughtlessly blows Chappy away as he passes his position and runs down a long hallway. He turns a corner and points his gun at the Mafioso cohort but pauses. He is already sitting with his throat cut. Smecker looks puzzled as Il Duce withdraws from the shadows behind him. The Duke pistol whips Smecker. He's out.}

As they speak, Il Duce watches. He then begins to whisper the prayer right along with them. Their words match up perfectly. He leans against the wall, holsters his guns, and withdraws a cigarette. He rolls it along his tongue and twists it into his lips. The boys are still reciting as he strikes a match. They react instantly. Still kneeling they each point a nickel-plated 45 toward The Duke. They turn in time to see the light from the match illuminate his face. Il Duce pauses then he strides into the room and proceeds to recite the last half of the prayer. He stops between the kneeling boys and finishes off the prayer. The boys are stunned as they realize this is their father. He makes the sign of the cross over Rocco. Then he looks down to the upturned faces of his sons. He places a hand on each of their cheeks.}
