<A>__{the storm has escalated. the holbrook house is without power. hilly runs around lighting candles. missus walters lies on the couch while minny fans her with a newspaper.}
<C>__{missus walters}
<D>__{you're making it a lot hotter flapping your arm like that.}
<A>__{minny stops and begins squirming with discomfort. missus walters notices her looking out to the garage bathroom. lightning strikes. leaves blow across the yard. hilly plops down in a chair with a candle.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{that should do it. minny, go get me and momma some iced tea.}
<A>__{minny hesitates. she gulps.}
<C>__{minny}
<D>__{uh...miss hilly?}
<C>__{hilly}

<A>__{as minny turns, missus walters calls out to her.}
<C>__{missus walters}
<D>__{you go on ahead and use the guest bath, minny. it's okay.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{oh, for crying out loud. it's just a little rain. she can go get an umbrella up in william's study!}
<C>__{missus walters}
<D>__{i believe she was working for me before you dragged us both here.}
<A>__{minny looks outside just as wind slams an aluminum lawn chair against the garage bathroom. boom! another crash of thunder. large hail stones begin falling in the yard.}
<C>__{minny}
