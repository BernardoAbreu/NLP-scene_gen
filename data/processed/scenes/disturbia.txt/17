<L>__{interior kale's bedroom the next morning}
<A>__{a few stray beams of sunlight pierce the blinds. otherwise, it's a tomb. clothes strewn everywhere. we track across the floor and a virtual debris field of junk food bags, wrappers, mountain dew cans... find kale in bed, ankle and bracelet stick out from the sheets, arm hangs over the side }
<L>__{interior kitchen morning}
<A>__{still a mess as we find kale, hair disheveled, rummaging through the cabinets. lots of costco size boxes: crackers, pringles... a huge box of twinkies. kale spots a jar of peanut butter. he grabs the nearest bowl, pulls a bottle of hershey's syrup from the fridge, pours it all into the bowl. he's about to throw the syrup bottle in the trash when something in the bottom of the can catches his eye. he reaches in, pulls out a bill for xbox live: subscription}
