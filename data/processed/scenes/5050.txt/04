<L>__{interior mount sinai hospital day}
<A>__{adam enters the hospital. the mood is calm. all the chaos one would expect to find in a hospital of this size is tucked away behind the sterile and monochrome walls. adam walks to the reception counter. the receptionist is engrossed with the latest edition of us weekly. she ignores adam who just stands there awkwardly, unsure of what to do. adam gives out a small cough to grab her attention. the receptionist keeps her eyes fixed on her magazine.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i have an appointment.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{name?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{adam schwartz.}
<A>__{the receptionist says nothing. adam stands silent, not knowing what to do. he coughs again. annoyed, the receptionist looks up but says nothing.}
<C>__{adam }
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{um, am i supposed to go somewhere?}
<A>__{with her eyes the receptionist points to the waiting area.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{oh, should i go sit?}
<A>__{the receptionist rolls her eyes and returns to her magazine. adam looks around the empty waiting room. he takes a seat and browses through a dozen outdated magazines: highlights, time, life, modern maternity, etc. only moments later, as though he hadn't just introduced himself, the receptionist calls out:}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{adam schwartz.}
<A>__{adam looks around the waiting room. there's no one else there. again the receptionist calls out again }
<C>__{receptionist }
<D>__{adam schwartz.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yeah, that's me.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{follow me.}
<A>__{the receptionist leads adam to a small changing room and hands him a hospital gown.}
<C>__{receptionist }
<D>__{put this on.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{do i need to take off all my clothes?}
<A>__{the receptionist stares blankly at adam.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{i will figure it out.}
<A>__{the receptionist leaves. adam awkwardly undresses and slips on the hospital gown. unsure which end of the gown is the front, adam adjusts the garment a few times until he decides he has it right. adam pulls back the curtain of the changing room to find joanne, an overly cheery nurse.}
<C>__{nurse joanne}
<D>__{hi adam, my name is joanne, so nice to meet you.}
<A>__{adam scratches his chest, the hospital gown is beginning to irritate his skin.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{you don't happen to have anything in a cotton blend?}
<C>__{nurse joanne}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{cotton. you're funny.}
<A>__{joanne hands adam a giant specimen cup marked with a thick yellow line.}
<C>__{nurse joanne }
<D>__{now i'm going to need you to fill this cup with urine. you think you can do that?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{you want me to fill this entire cup.}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{yup.}
<A>__{adam looks down at the cup in total disbelief.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's gonna take me at least a week to fill this. can i take it home?}
<C>__{joanne}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{take it home. you're so funny.}
<A>__{the camera pans to reveal a group of medical students taking diligent notes in the background. we pan again this time to the next room:}
