<A>__{a very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the town rushing around the car park and the streets across the highway, endeavoring to put out the two fires. we see automobiles coming to a stop on highway one, and the oil smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the parked cars. some men have managed to start a fire hose and have trained it on the burning cars. suddenly but slowly the foreground in the sky just below the camera begins to fill with wheeling gulls. the whole picture below becomes obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop down on the town.}
