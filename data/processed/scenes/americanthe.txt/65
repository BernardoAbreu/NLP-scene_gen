<L>__{exterior woods day}
<A>__{jack has parked his citroen in the shade of a squat but ample walnut tree. in the near distance is a lake. jack crunches over half formed walnuts until he reaches a patch of soft grass beside the water. this, he decides, is the perfect spot. he unrolls a blanket, kneels, and from his knapsack he produces: a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a chilled bottle of frascati a loaf of course bread 50 gms of pecorino 100 gms of proscuitto a small jar of black olives an orange and a rolled blanket containing the disassembled parts of the socimi submachine gun. jack sets the stopwatch on his weather beaten rolex. it takes approximately thirty four seconds to assemble the bastardised socimi including telescopic sights and sound suppressor and a further six seconds to press ten rounds into the magazine, slot it into the base of the hand grip, snuggle the butt to his shoulder and place his eye beside the rubber cup on the sight. he's fast. carefully he surveys the lake. settles on a clump of reeds. and with the focus and dexterity of a surgeon, concentrates until his grip and aim are perfectly tense and still. a beat... ...as jack holds his breath. then squeezes the trigger. choop! choop! choop! not the conventional "phut, phut, phut" of a movie silencer, but the genuine dampened sonic boom of a tac 65 sound suppressor. through the sight we see the water churn at four o'clock to the reed clump and four metres off. from the knapsack, jack takes a watchmaker's steel handled screwdriver and adjusts the sight, then loads another ten rounds in the magazine. choop! choop! choop! the reeds are clipped, the bullets slapping into the bank behind, mud spurting. jack adjusts again and reloads. choop choop choop choop choop! the reed clump is shot to shit.}
