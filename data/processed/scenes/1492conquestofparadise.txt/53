<L>__{exterior santa maria rigging and crow's nest day}
<A>__{we experience a sense of vertigo as we near the top of the main mast, high above the rolling deck. the boy curls like a fetus in the swinging crow's nest, exhausted by the heat, and scared. his eyes are turning white. he begins to piss himself...}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior santa maria deck day}
<A>__{piss is dripping on the deck. the sailors do not seem to care. the cook takes a chicken from a cage. he breaks its neck, and starts plucking it. the others continue their bitter conversation.}
<C>__{alonso}
<D>__{we should have seen land.}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{we left three weeks ago, alonso. can't be that near.}
<C>__{alonso}
<D>__{can't be that far, i say. also, i don't like the smell of the sea around here. smells like a cunt. bad sign...}
<A>__{the cook starts laughing. they turn to him.}
<C>__{cook}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{of course it smells like it! that's why sailors take to the sea!}
<A>__{they all laugh. alonso looks up at columbus standing on the poop deck, scrutinizing the horizon, waiting for the land to appear.}
<C>__{alonso}
<D>__{and why does this one take to the sea? nobody knows. never says a word...}
<A>__{mendez has sensed the danger of this lack of respect. he approaches them.}
<C>__{mendez}
<D>__{to your post! at once!}
<A>__{they split in silence.}
