<L>__{interior matrix men's room night}
<A>__{still in slow motion, the younger duke is trying to eat a huge spansule of acid. with difficulty.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{i decided to eat only half at first. good thinking. but i spilled the rest on the sleeve of my red pendleton shirt.}
<A>__{duke stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do. c u of the door to the men's room as a musician enters speaking in slow motion.}
<C>__{musician}
<D>__{what's the trouble?}
<C>__{duke}
<P>__{(also in slow motion)}
<D>__{well, all this white stuff on my sleeve is lsd.}
<A>__{the musician approaches and looks down at duke's arm. a long pause. cut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean cut, preppy, stockbroker type enters. he freezes in horror. we cut to his pov. duke is standing in the middle of the men's room with the musician hunkered down at his side... sucking on his sleeve. a very gross tableau. the stockbroker slowly eases out of the room.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{with a bit of luck his life was ruined forever thinking that just behind some narrow door in all his favorite bars, men in red pendleton shirts are getting incredible kicks from things he'll never know.}
