<L>__{exterior night later}
<A>__{arthur guides naomi in the dark. she stumbles.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{okay, i'm officially a little worried.}
<A>__{she tries to pull her blindfold off.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{don't worry!}
<A>__{arthur removes her blindfold. she's stunned to find herself on a huge blanket under a tree in a clearing lit by numerous candles. before them is spread the most amazing picnic of all time. flowers are everywhere. a log fire burns in a grate. soft music plays.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{you said you wanted a picnic.}
<A>__{he pours them glasses of 1928 krug.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{arthur, i don't know what to say. it's beautiful.}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{who did all this?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{the picnic fairies. who liaised with the flower fairies, the candle fairies, the log fire fairies, the hidden sound system fairies...}
<A>__{he lifts a silver platter lid to reveal a vast pizza.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{...and the pizza fairies.}
<A>__{a crack of a twig from somewhere.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{did you take account of the heroin fairies who hang here at night?}
<A>__{but there's nobody there. a cool breeze blows. naomi shivers. arthur uses a remote to turn the log fire flames up.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{it's nice to keep it simple like this. i'm sick of michelin star restaurants. all that embarrassing crap with the specials.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{are you kidding? where i normally eat, the special's the one that comes with a free toy.}
<A>__{arthur lifts a grill lid to turn over succulent steaks.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{you're rich rich, aren't you?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i get by.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{`it doesn't remotely matter how much or what you spend it on' rich?}
<A>__{arthur shrugs and swigs champagne, pouring more.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{craziest thing you ever bought?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i once inadvertently financed a terrorist cell who said they needed 100,000 to open a falafel stall.}
<A>__{she laughs. she stops laughing.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{oh my g d, you're serious.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what's the craziest thing you ever told a tour party?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{i once said the manhattan we were in was actually a movie set built for `you've got mail', but that after the film wrapped, everyone moved to the set because there was less crime.}
<A>__{a sudden, very loud, very out of date ring tone. naomi takes out a huge ancient motorola phone.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{yes, dad? there's a small tiffany butter knife about two inches from his hand but it might take him eight months to dismember me with it.}
<P>__{(phone bleeps)}
<D>__{gotta go, battery. love you too.}
<A>__{she ends the call.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{mom died last year. for eight months dad ate nothing but popeye's chicken n' biscuits in front of csi. so i persuaded him to move in with me. where he eats popeye's chicken n' biscuits in front of csi.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{sounds like you're very good to him.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{what are you gonna do? all those years your folks tucked you in, did their best to stop you from eating crap in front of the tv. and then one day, you're the one saying `no, honey, it's bad for you! go to bed.' weird, huh?}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(not relating at all)}
<D>__{yeah. i hate that.}
<P>__{(looks at her phone)}
<D>__{nice bit of kitsch. where did you find that?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{at&t store in 1998.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{it's...you've had it twelve years?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{it's a fine phone. battery life of eleven seconds, which cuts the crap right out of conversations.}
<A>__{something weird is happening. the world wobbles imperceptibly as the background drops away. she hasn't noticed yet.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{i can't believe these mofos who gotta keep up with the latest bullshit. cds come along, so out with the vinyl. vinyl's back in, out with the cds. i just kept the vinyl. way cheaper, and i get to be incredibly hip once every 20 years....}
<A>__{a beat. she looks around. and down.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{what the hell is going on?}
<A>__{cutting wide, we see that the picnic was taking place on a grass covered platform with a tree planted in it which is being lifted off the ground by a crane!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i couldn't decide between picnic in the park and dinner with a view. so it's a picnic in the sky! isn't it ace?}
<A>__{the whole thing is rising higher and higher and higher.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{no it is not ace, you crazy english bastard! this is dangerous!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{oh, sorry. forgot. they said to put these on.}
<A>__{he pulls back the blanket to reveal seat belts. he straps her in.}
<C>__{arthur }
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{naomi, it's okay! it's very safe. it's this company called `aerial delights'. they specialise in catering unusual events at a height of 180 feet above the ground.}
<A>__{a gust of wind blows the structure, which swings. naomi screams.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{so what got you into the walking tours?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{you're seriously making date small talk while this is going on?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{be still. breathe deep.}
<P>__{(strikes a zen pose)}
<D>__{`when you can be calm in the midst of activity, this is the true state of nature': huanchu daoeren.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{`lower this freak show to the ground and get me a cab': naomi snart.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(handing her something)}
<D>__{taste this truffle.}
<A>__{naomi tastes it. it's clearly delicious. she gazes around as the crane swings them out over the hudson. the view of manhattan, of the river, of the statue of liberty, is mind bogglingly gorgeous from up here. naomi bursts out laughing. she sips champagne.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{what the hell. gotta go sometime, right? at least it won't be years of pain like mom. just a few seconds of screaming and falling with a truffle in my mouth.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so anyway. the tours...}
<C>__{naomi}
<P>__{(calming herself)}
<D>__{okay, okay. be deep. breathe still. the tours are a temporary nine year fill in until i'm drowned in a tsunami of apologies from everyone who failed to recognise my writing genius first time round.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what did you write?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{a kids' book. i sent a chapter to a childrens' publisher. sunshine press'. the rejection letter was the meanest thing i ever read.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{kids can be so cruel...}
<C>__{naomi}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{arthur? we have a problem.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i told you, don't worry. these crane people know what they're doing!}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{not that kind of problem.}
<A>__{arthur feels a blade at his throat. he looks up to see a junkie, clearly high, standing over him.}
<C>__{junkie}
<D>__{phone. and the watch. hurry.}
<A>__{arthur hands him his phone and watch.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{um. out of interest, how did you get up here?}
<C>__{junkie}
<D>__{what you talkin' about, dog?}
<A>__{we see a sleeping bag and needles behind the tree!}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{great. `picnic in the sky' followed by `robbed in the sky'!}
<A>__{arthur get the giggles as the junkie reaches into his pocket for his wallet. naomi gets involuntary giggles too.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{this isn't funny, you lunatic.}
<A>__{the junkie stuffs his face with food, swigs champagne from the bottle, then walks away. phew. then...}
<C>__{arthur and naomi}
<D>__{noooo!}
<A>__{the junkie's walking towards the edge, oblivious! arthur jumps up, causing the platform to wobble scarily. he grabs the junkie's arm. the junkie swipes, cutting arthur's hand.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{owww! you don't understand! we're 180 feet up in the sky!}
<C>__{junkie}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{you on the same shit as me, yeah? good stuff, right?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{no, we're not high! well we are, but only in the literal sense.}
<A>__{the junkie hurries away again. he's about to walk off the edge. arthur runs and grabs him. they end up in a messy struggle, the platform rocking badly.}
<C>__{arthur }
<P>__{(to naomi)}
<D>__{hit the panic button! it's next to the truffle station!}
<A>__{naomi's panicking, searching desperately. arthur and the junkie roll over the posh food, right to the edge!}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{hurry!}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{i can't find it. over here?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{no! that's the bouquet of world hams!}
<A>__{naomi finds the truffle station and hits the panic button. down in a crane cab an alarm goes off. the driver starts to lower the platform. naomi tries to help arthur as he struggles with the junkie, but she gets slashed on the ear. she screams. as the platform lowers, it swings back over the river to the land and tips them all into the river!}
