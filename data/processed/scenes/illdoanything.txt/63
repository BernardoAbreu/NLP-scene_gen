<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior rooftop day}
<A>__{this rooftop serves as an outdoor commissary for popcorn pictures. there are a few tables, snack machines and umbrellas. the whole "d" staff is there, including cathy, having lunch, along with claire, the casting assistant. in the b.g., we see matt, huddled, sitting on the roof's awful green outdoor carpeting, feeling much the same as jeannie in the previous scene.}
<B>__{on matt}
<A>__{off in the distance, the popcorn execs contentedly ply their trade. as he overhears their conversation and the words begin to register in all their horror.}
<C>__{millie}
<D>__{will somebody take a minute to look over my casting list before burke gets here?}
<C>__{male d person}
<P>__{(scanning list)}
<D>__{this isn't so great, millie.}
<C>__{millie}
<D>__{well, i wanted to put in people we had a shot at getting.}
<C>__{male d person}
<P>__{(reading from list)}
<D>__{f. murray abraham, jeff daniels, ed harris, john lithgow, rip torn, willem dafoe, john malkovich... for an action lead?}
<C>__{millie}
<D>__{could you at least take it one person at a time instead of...}
<C>__{male d person}
<D>__{okay. let's play 'state the obvious'... f. murray abraham has a nose as long as an aspen ski line, ed harris is losing his hair, joe mantegna has never played the lead in a big movie... willem dafoe's teeth... bob hoskins looks fur bearing when he takes off his shirt... malkovich...}
<A>__{matt can take it no more. he hears a loud voice coming from his own throat. he wigs out.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i can't stand it anymore. i can't.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{what's wrong? what happened?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what, in god's name, are you doing in this job you have?}
<B>__{shot}
<A>__{as they all start to answer at once.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i mean him. what, in god's name, do you know about casting?}
<C>__{male d person}
<D>__{me?}
<A>__{matt rises and walks towards the male d person.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yes. what do you know? about anything? you don't even know you have a habit of touching your tongue with a finger like you want to lick yourself.}
<P>__{(note: this is his little habit)}
<D>__{yet, you talk like you actually know something... so i want you to tell me...}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{...what you know.}
<C>__{male d person}
<D>__{i'm not going to be drawn into this.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i've been an actor most of my life and this is the first time i've ever heard what the people calling the shots sound like when they're casting. so i really want to find out what, if anything, you know because what if nothing you know.}
<C>__{female d person}
<D>__{i don't think the yelling is necessary.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{oh, you couldn't be more wrong. and i'm not talking to you. and i don't like you.}
<C>__{male d person}
<D>__{how about you just mind your own business?}
<A>__{matt is very close to him he shakes his chair.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you're minding my business. that's the problem... so, just tell me, what do you know?}
<B>__{on male d person}
<A>__{matt's manner is threatening. the male d person looks around for some support and finds little... then matt's tone changes... it's reasonable, almost seductive.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{just tell me and i will shut up.}
<C>__{male d person}
<P>__{(taking the bait)}
<D>__{first of all, i've been going to movies since i was six, for god's sake...}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what you know is the size of a schnozz. what you don't know is that these guys...}
<P>__{(indicates list)}
<D>__{...are for real...}
<B>__{on cathy}
<A>__{she is a ricochet victim of every word matt says, as he continues to indict the male d person and unknowingly reach her instead. his fury grows and becomes more complicated, containing an element of mourning.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{...that they can make something happen, and even they don't know what that is till they get in there and play a little... they can make something happen that you can't even imagine... and it's not your fault, this stupidity... 'cause you're just this scared little prick who gets to say he's making movies, and the only thing they ever taught you is that what you like doesn't matter.}
<C>__{male d person}
<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{thanks for understanding.}
<A>__{the anger leaves matt. he is depleted.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{but isn't it almost good manners for you to feel a little shame?}
<A>__{cathy rises and begins to exit.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{i didn't mean you.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{if you didn't, you sure should have.}
<A>__{she exits. the d person's colleagues have taken advantage of the beat to egg him on.}
<C>__{male d person}
<D>__{you talk about manners are you actually so bitter you don't realize how you acted just now? you're gone, pal. but at least know that we can't help that we're making it.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{oh, shit. you win. you got lucky with 'bitter.' that word just scares me to death.}
