<L>__{exterior st. mere cathedral night (later)}
<A>__{dark. artillery rumbles in the distance. reiben, jackson, wade and upham sleep. miller still sits in the glow of his flashlight, studying his maps. sarge lies near him, awake, watching him. sarge notices some unopened envelopes in miller's map case and speaks quietly to him.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{you ever going to open those letters? miller keeps his eyes on the maps.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{it's not normal, not reading letters from home.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{since when have things been normal?}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{you got me. afraid of bad news?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{good news?}
<A>__{miller looks at sarge. a moment passes between the two of them, then miller takes refuge in the maps. sarge looks at the men.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{you think they'll be alright?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{they're fine. as long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{and what about you?}
<A>__{miller considers the question, doesn't answer.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{they guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{command isn't going to let them withdraw and the germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{three for three.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{if we stayed, we could make a difference.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{you're kidding yourself.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you never know.}
<A>__{they sit in silence for a moment.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{i hope this boy ryan is worth it.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{now you're the one kidding yourself.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hell of a mission.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{yup, hell of a mission.}
<A>__{miller looks at his watch, rises and barks at the men.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{rise and shine, boys. let's go.}
<A>__{grumbling, the men get up and start shouldering up their gear.}
