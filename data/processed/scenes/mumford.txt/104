<L>__{interior mumford's office day}
<A>__{tight on rapid series of images on slick, glossy magazine pages: each change of image is punctuated by the amplified snap of the page being turned, like a gunshot. we're so close to the images we can't tell when the magazines change from glamour to vogue to us to mademoiselle to w to vanity fair. and it doesn't matter. whether the images are ads or fashion spreads or celebrity candids, the look is the same jaded, hip, disinterested, apathetic, either impossibly buff or anorexic, but always severely beautiful. the page turning starts at a fevered pitch and becomes even more intense. finally }
<C>__{mumford }
<D>__{what is it, nessa?}
<A>__{the images continue.}
<C>__{nessa }
<D>__{isn't she amazing? that is such a wicked look.}
<C>__{mumford }
<D>__{what do you want me to see?}
<C>__{nessa }
<D>__{just chill for a second. look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.}
<A>__{mumford is sitting next to nessa on the couch. at their feet is a mess of magazines. nessa discards one and immediately starts flipping through a new one beneath it. she is very agitated. mumford stands up, walks over and sits in his chair.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{what are you doing? we're not done. i just need to find the thing...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{if you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{i want to have the session. i thought it would be cool if i could show you some of the things that interest me. but i guess you're not into it... which we already knew.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what happened today?}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{was it something that happened at school?}
<C>__{nessa}
<P>__{(petulant)}
<D>__{these appointments were not my idea, remember.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{true. should we stop them?}
<A>__{a look of panic crosses nessa's face, but she instantly hides it, busily taking out cigarette and lighter, which she doesn't use. instead, she lies down on the couch, balancing the closed magazine on her chest.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{i don't think you know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{this shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?}
<A>__{mumford waits. nessa refers to the magazine beneath her chin.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{i want to live in the world these people are in. no one ever says anything in there, have you noticed? so they're very cool. like they're all really deep. it's when people start talking that everything goes to shit.}
<A>__{nessa suddenly seems on the edge of tears, but beats it back.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{there's this kid at school... martin brockett. he has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. you wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... who appointed him my spiritual leader? if he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? and why's he spend all his time chasing after me? probably thinks i'm gonna give him a hummer...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{do you think that's what he wants?}
<C>__{nessa}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{no. i don't know what he wants. but i know i don't like being watched. nobody's ever paid any attention to what i did, and i liked it just fine. where does he get off telling me i disrespect myself?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{fuck him. look in a mirror, bozo.}
