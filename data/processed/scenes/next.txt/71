<L>__{interior wisdom's office day}
<A>__{wisdom and ferris are both traumatized by the torture.}
<C>__{wisdom}
<D>__{okay, how do we use him to find the bombs?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{simple. we make him watch the news and tell us about it.}
<C>__{wisdom}
<D>__{how far ahead can he see?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{i don't know. but i suspect we can increase his range with practice. especially if we restrict his future to only watching news. then he'll be like a timescope.}
<A>__{wisdom nods.}
<C>__{wisdom}
<D>__{you were right. this is huge.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{this is just for starters. you want to stage a pre emptive strike, he can tell you if you'll hit the target and whether they hit back and what went wrong. and you can do this over and over until you get it perfect before you begin.}
<A>__{wisdom chuckles at the enormity of the potential.}
<D>__{wisdom and all he's ever done with it is a little gambling and securities fraud? ferris i know, it's amazing; but he's not ambitious. wisdom damn, how will we control this guy when he figures out what he's capable of? ferris we control him now. we just have to keep it that way.}
<C>__{wisdom}
<D>__{right now, sweetheart, we can't even get him to sit in a chair.}
<A>__{dread suddenly washes over wisdom.}
<C>__{wisdom}
<D>__{we've got to think this through. your friend could be more dangerous than the terrorists. ferris aren't you running ahead of yourself?}
<C>__{wisdom}
<D>__{with this guy, you have to. or it'll be over before it begins. ferris so we'll keep him in chains.}
<C>__{wisdom}
<D>__{that may not be enough. we may have to cut off his arms and legs. then i might start to feel safe.}
<A>__{ferris grins uncomfortably.}
<D>__{ferris you're not serious.}
<C>__{wisdom}
<D>__{think about it. what we're talking about here is the next step in human evolution. and i'm not gonna make the same mistake the neanderthals made when they ran across this good looking homo sapien fellow and all the lady neanderthals said, "he's so cute. let's keep him around."}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{can we deal with your sexual insecurities at another time?}
<C>__{wisdom}
<D>__{you mean after it's too late?}
<A>__{ferris seems to come around to wisdom's logic.}
<D>__{ferris i wish you'd given me a chance to chain him up before you decided to prune him into a stump.}
<A>__{they are both filled with dread.}
<D>__{wisdom you think he knows? already?}
<A>__{white room cris on the floor. his expression hardens. corridors ferris and wisdom stride through the facility almost at a run.}
<D>__{wisdom i haven't made any firm decisions. maybe we will just keep him tied up.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{i told you, he doesn't read minds. he sees the results.}
<B>__{white room}
<A>__{cris rises from the floor into a crouched position, like an animal ready to pounce. the door flies open and a dozen armed mp's charge in, rifles at the ready, and surround cris. cris checks the time on the digital clock. it's 5:12 pm. corridors ferris and wisdom getting closer; he's on a cellphone.}
<D>__{wisdom tell baines to meet us there. and bring a dozen men.}
<B>__{white room}
<A>__{motionless, in a crouch...cris suddenly dashes between two mp's, shoves them aside, makes for the door. he gets smashed by the rifle butts of the nearest ones, then stomped by the full contingent. [attempt #1] area outside the white room ferris and wisdom arrive and look through the window.}
