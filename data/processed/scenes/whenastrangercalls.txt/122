<A>__{tracy and clifford are sitting at a small table in the kitchen, looking haggard, drinking coffee.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{now... it's been years. they're grown up.}
<A>__{they look at each other. clifford is a sympathetic listener.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{i look at where i am now. i know i could've done better, but... it's too late for that.}
<C>__{clifford}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{well, you've got to keep looking, i suppose.}
<A>__{taking his cue, clifford slowly rises.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{i don't think he'll come back here.}
<A>__{tracy looks up at him questioningly, wishing she could feel as sure about it as he does.}
<C>__{clifford}
<P>__{(extending his hand)}
<D>__{thanks... for all your help.}
<A>__{tracy takes his hand. they shake warmly.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{i know it wasn't easy.}
<P>__{(turning to go)}
<D>__{maybe, someday, i will be able to...}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{i wish you wouldn't leave me altogether...}
<A>__{clifford turns back to her.}
<C>__{tracy}
<P>__{(with a laugh)}
<D>__{i'm not a young woman anymore. i've given up all my dreams of the future. now, i just want to make it to the end. you know what i mean.}
<A>__{clifford smiles at her gently. he knows exactly what she means.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{i will be around.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{clifford takes a few steps, turns back, looks at her.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{you like ice cream?}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{what flavor?}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{chocolate chip.}
<A>__{clifford nods his head slightly, as if registering this in his memory.}
<C>__{clifford}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{they smile at each other for a second then clifford leaves and tracy sits alone in her kitchen, listening to him go, hearing the door close behind him.}
