<L>__{interior salieri's apartment bedroom day 1780's}
<A>__{the young salieri is kneeling in desperation before the cross.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{please! please! send him away, back to salzburg. for his sake as well as mine.}
<A>__{cu, christ staring from the cross.}
<T>__{cut back to:}
<L>__{interior audience hall archbishop's palace salzburg day 1780's}
<A>__{we see leopold kneeling now not to the cross but to archbishop colloredo, sitting impassively on his throne. count arco stands beside him. leopold is a desperate, once handsome man of sixty, now far too much the subservient courtier.}
<C>__{colloredo}
<D>__{no! i won't have him back.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{but he needs to be here in salzburg, your grace. he needs me and he needs you. your protection, your understanding.}
<C>__{colloredo}
<D>__{hardly.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{oh sir, yes! he's about to make the worst mistake of his life. some little viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. i know my son. he is too simple to see the trap and there is no one there who really cares for him.}
<C>__{colloredo}
<D>__{i'm not surprised. money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. he has sold himself to vienna. let vienna look out for him.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{sir }
<C>__{colloredo}
<D>__{your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{yes, sir, that's the truth. but don't blame him. the fault is mine. i was too indulgent with him. but not again. never again, i promise! i implore you let me bring him back here. i will make him give his word to serve you faithfully.}
<C>__{colloredo}
<D>__{and how will you make him keep it?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. please, your grace, give him one more chance.}
<C>__{colloredo}
<D>__{you have leave to try.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{oh, your grace i thank your grace! i thank you!}
<A>__{in deepest gratitude he kisses the archbishop's hand. he motions leopold to rise. we hear the first dark fortissimo chord which begins the overture to don giovanni: the theme associated with the character of the commendatore.}
<C>__{leopold }
<D>__{my dear son.}
<A>__{the second fortissimo chord sounds.}
