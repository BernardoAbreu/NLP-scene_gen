<L>__{exterior chimera foredeck night}
<A>__{murphy stands watch by the fire as epps joins him.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{couldn't sleep.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{wish i could say the same.}
<A>__{they watch the fire in silence for a moment.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what do you think happened on this boat?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{the what?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{never mind. before your time.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. the usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. what happened after that is anybody's guess. but, judging by our greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{are we smart enough to avoid that?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i don't know, are we?}
<A>__{a beat as she looks back at him. she looks back to the fire, watching it.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{when you found me yesterday, at the pool. i'd seen... something. someone.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{not our mystery guest again.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{no. someone else. a girl.}
<P>__{(hesitating, a beat)}
<D>__{i'm not sure she was... real.}
<A>__{she looks up to murphy.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{not real?}
<A>__{a beat as she only looks back.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{what, like some kind of ghost?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i don't know what else you'd call her. one second she was there, the next she was gone.}
<A>__{another beat as he looks on at her.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{and i had a kind of hallucination.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{there were others. i saw them in the pool. drowning.}
<A>__{a beat as murphy looks back, as she sees him.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{maybe hallucination is the wrong word. it was more than that. as though they were showing me.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{showing you what?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what happened.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those greeks.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{no. i think they are, were, just passengers. innocent victims.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{victims of what?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{something bad happened here, murphy.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{that much i think we've already established.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{more than just a mutiny. more than just the gold.}
<A>__{a beat as he holds there.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{she said the ship was evil. that we had to leave right away. that if we didn't, we might never leave.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{a beat as she looks back.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{why you? how come the rest of us haven't seen these people?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{just lucky i guess.}
<A>__{another beat as he holds on her.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{well. getting off this ship's exactly what we're trying to do. short of that, i don't know what else to tell you.}
<A>__{she only looks back at him, then into the fire.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{do me a favor and wake up dodge. he's next on.}
<A>__{she starts to get up.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{and epps?}
<A>__{she stands, looking back at him.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{you can tell the others about this. but, for my money, i think it's best you keep it to yourself.}
<A>__{she holds there a beat longer, then turns, walking off.}
