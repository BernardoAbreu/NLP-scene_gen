<L>__{interior leper colony meeta's room day}
<A>__{the rain continues, as does the work in the clinic. max is working on anouar, aloka assisting. meeta and the baby (now 6 months old) in the b.g.}
<C>__{anouar}
<D>__{i think aloka would have a gentler touch than you, max daddah. maybe she should perform this surgery on her own.}
<A>__{aloka ducks her eyes, embarrassed.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{last time you told me you were more than two women could manage.}
<C>__{anouar}
<D>__{yes, but given a choice between one and none, i will accept the one.}
<A>__{max lifts anouar off the table and places him on his cart.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{okay, you ought to be good for another few days. send in the next patient.}
<A>__{anouar scoots out. max and aloka both turn to the instruments lying on the table and knock a pair of scissors to the floor. simultaneously, they bend to pick it up and bang heads.}
<B>__{low angle}
<A>__{the first impulse of each is to touch the other's head. but almost simultaneously, their hands freeze short of touching. several months ago, max might have tried to kiss her; now, though, there is friendship and affection. from here, we see a pair of bare feet. we come with max and aloka up.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{shoba, a deeply concerned look on his face. slowly his hands come forward, holding his parrot, with a broken wing. he puts the parrot on the examining table.}
