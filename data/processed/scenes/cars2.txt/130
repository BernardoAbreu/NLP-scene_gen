<D>__{no, no, it's okay! tell them, mater. explain.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{okay! somebody's been sabotaging the racers and hurting the cars and i know who. oh wait... your majesty.}
<A>__{mater bows to the queen. in doing so, the ticking time bomb angles into view. the clock's at t minus 1:53.}
<C>__{queen's guards}
<D>__{ bomb! it's a bomb! everybody down! look out!}
<C>__{finn }
<D>__{hold your fire! he can't disarm it!}
<A>__{finn dives onto the platform and rolls between the queen and mater.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{mater, i don't know what you're doing but stand down now!}
<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(aside, to mcqueen)}

<C>__{mater}
<D>__{it's him.}
<C>__{miles axlerod}
<D>__{what? me? you've got to be crazy.}
<A>__{everyone exchanges confused looks, including finn and holley.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{i figured it out when i realized you all attached this ticking time bomb with whitworth bolts. the same bolts that hold together that old british engine from the photograph. holley! show that picture.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{o kay...}
<A>__{holley projects the much discussed photo of the engine.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{and then i remembered what they say about old british engines "if there ain't no oil under `em, there ain't no oil in `em."}
<C>__{miles axlerod}
<D>__{what is he talking about?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{it was you leaking oil at the party in japan. you just blamed it on me.}
<C>__{miles axlerod}
<D>__{electric cars don't use oil, you twit.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{then you're faking it. you didn't convert to no electric. we pop that hood we gonna see that engine from that picture right there.}
<A>__{mater moves toward miles axlerod to pop his hood.}
<C>__{miles axlerod}
<D>__{this lorry's crazy. he's going to kill us all!}
<A>__{miles axlerod backs up to the edge of the stage.}
<C>__{miles axlerod}
<D>__{stay away!}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{but sir axlerod created the race, mater. why would he want to hurt anyone?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{to make allinol look bad so everybody'd go back to using oil. i mean, he said it himself with that disguised voice.}
<C>__{miles axlerod}
<D>__{"dee sguised voice?" what are you talking about? you're nuts, you are!}
<A>__{the queen's guards have had enough. as has the prince.}
<C>__{prince wheeliam}
<D>__{this is going nowhere fast. we really should go, grandmother.}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{one moment. i'd like to see where this is going.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{mater, he created allinol.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{yeah, but what if he found that huge oil field just as the world was trying to find something else?}
<A>__{mater sticks his ticking bomb nose into miles axlerod's grill.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{what if he came up with allinol just to make alternative fuel look bad?}
<C>__{miles axlerod}
<D>__{"what if?" you're basing this on a "what if"?!}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{okay, that's it.}
<A>__{and the queen's guards spirit the queen and prince wheeliam out of there fast }
<C>__{miles axlerod}
<D>__{wait! somebody save me! the lorry's crazy!}
<A>__{now it's just miles axlerod, mater, mcqueen, finn and holley. miles axlerod's back tires slip on the edge of the podium as he is cornered by mater.}
<C>__{miles axlerod}
<D>__{keep away, you idiot!}
