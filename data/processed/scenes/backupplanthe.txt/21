<C>__{mona}
<D>__{why did you join a support group of unattractive, militant lesbians when you have me?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{because you're really not that supportive.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{sure i am.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{you just told me that if i breast feed "my girls" will end up looking like empty tube socks.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{i'm just being honest. and don't even get me started on what childbirth does to your bladder.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{what does it do to your bladder?}

<A>__{zoe takes a sip of coffee and looks out the window.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{so, should i call this guy? do you think that would be weird?}
<C>__{mona}

<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{then, no.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{let's go spy on him. come on. it will be fun. like high school.}
