<C>__{admiral robertson}

<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you've really been generous to give us this cruise. i know i speak for everybody on board.}

<D>__{hell, there's just twenty or so of you we only need a skeleton crew and it's a pleasure to sail her anyway.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{by the way, congratulations on winning the intramural diving championships, miles. i'm sure you made your old man proud.}
<A>__{admiral robertson gives his own son a glance; maybe sean should think about doing the same.}

<C>__{admiral robertson}
<D>__{but before you take the helm, take this.}
<A>__{he tosses sean a wrapped box. sean opens it. inside is a navigational computer the size of a calculator, sitting next to a rusty old sextant.}
<C>__{admiral robertson}
<D>__{something old and something new. i used the sextant when i was your age, but now they have these goddamn computers to do all the work for you.}
<C>__{chief engineer}
<P>__{(to sean)}
<D>__{have you decided on a plan of departure, captain?}
<A>__{sean's nervous. he eyes the omega, quickly glancing at the loran, briefly referring to the navigational chart.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{how about if we start up the forward engines and come around. 180 degrees...}
<C>__{admiral robertson}
<D>__{aren't you forgetting something?}
<A>__{sean looks flustered. admiral robertson storms to a large button, pressing it three times, piercing the air with three long blasts of the ship's horn. it underscores his frustration.}
<C>__{admiral robertson}
<D>__{we're in foggy weather! send out the international maritime signal that a vessel is backing down, followed by a security broadcast warning other ships!}
<A>__{he shoves the mike out at sean, but he doesn't grab it, leaving the bridge, humiliated. there's an awkward moment for miles, unable to find any appropriate words. he exits as well. admiral robertson stares out the bridge window, saddened and frustrated. it wasn't supposed to go this way.}

<A>__{the water begins to ripple as the ship's speed increases. all seems normal...until jason's hands appear, clinging to a loose mooring line dragging in the water. he slithers up the side towards the deck as dense fog breezes past him.}

<A>__{sean pats her dog. there's an awkward pause...they are obviously in the early stages of a relationship. sean reaches into his coat pocket, bringing back a small necklace sized box.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i got you a present.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{but i didn't get you one...}
<C>__{sean}

<C>__{sean}

<A>__{mcculloch appears behind them. the mood has been broken.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i guess i will see you later.}
<A>__{sean leaves. mcculloch steps up to rennie, pointing out to the foggy sea. her respiration increases as she psyches herself up to look.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{there's a storm predicted tonight.}

<A>__{as lightning flashes over a gray, choppy sea. a storm is imminent. the princess ruby finally appears, cutting through whitecaps, no land in sight. close up ink dip pen as rennie's hand carefully dips it in india ink, moving to a blank page in her journal. she hesitates for several beats.}

<D>__{climb!!!}
<A>__{she shoves him up it from below, sean summoning everything he's got to obey her. rennie shoots a stare back down the tunnel... rennie's point of view (efx) the overhead lights are banging around like an earthquake has just hit; the liquid will be arriving any second. her vision whip pans 180 degrees to find jason approaching from the opposite end, groping around with his scaly arms like the claws of a roto tiller. angle ladder as rennie starts up after sean, looking down and seeing:}
<B>__{jason}
<A>__{within ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder like he's working on some kind of radar.}
<B>__{rennie}
<A>__{slips on the rusty ladder, regaining her footing. and rushing higher. she takes her final glance into the tunnel, the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as she sees:}

<A>__{a million gallons of green brown toxic waste splash into the far intersection, filling the tunnel, flooding}
<B>__{straight for camera. jason}

<L>__{interior tunnel #3 (model efx)}
<A>__{tons of lethal sewage, stopping for no one. arriving in seconds. jason's final close up (efx fiber optic lens) he doesn't need vision to confirm what his other senses already know. jason's mouth begins to quaver...and the first words he has ever spoken come out, in the voice of}
<T>__{an eight year old boy:}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{mmmmmmmmmommy...don't let me drown, mommy...}
<A>__{camera speeds toward his gaping mouth and down his throat as lightning arcs off his mucous covered insides. we sink deeper into his guts, fire and smoke flaring into our eves, eventually coming to a well in the pit of his stomach, filled with blood...and eight year old jason is}

<C>__{young jason}
<D>__{hhhhelp me....}

<L>__{interior tunnel #3 on rennie and sean (efx)}
<A>__{the powerful flood thrashes the ladder about two inches below rennie's feet, the force of it fiercely shaking their rusty support. they are clinging to the ladder with their eyes squeezed shut. praying for survival.}

<A>__{we are drowning in a chunky cloud of sewage, rushing over and under us.}

<B>__{manhattan.}
<A>__{angle sean and rennie (efx) as the sewage level begins to drop. rennie opens her eyes, glancing straight down and seeing. rennie's point of view (efx) the ladder beneath them reappears...which gives way to a pair of hands gripping the bottom rung. the liquid drops further, unshrouding the now dead corpse of eight year old jason. he's a relatively normal looking boy, probably the way he looked back in 1957...right when he drowned in crystal lake. jason voorhees has finally been put to rest.}

<A>__{rennie would smile if she could. she kisses his cheek. they amble on.}
<B>__{stalking point of view}
<A>__{...coming out from another alley, creeping up behind them through a crowd of pedestrians. about the height of a small child.}
<B>__{rennie and sean}
<A>__{walk arm in arm, exhausted and oblivious to their pursuer. but something, some innate perception causes rennie to slow...and stop. her eyes register a horrid fear and she whips around to face... toby! limping on all fours, filthy with grease matted fur. the whimpering dog crawls up to her, rennie bending down, hugging her animal like she'll never let go.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{oh toby...}
<A>__{high angle crane shot (n.y.) as sean bends down too, ruffling the dog's fur, standing again with rennie. the three survivors enter the collage of pedestrians, bright lights and skyscrapers. it is finally over.}
