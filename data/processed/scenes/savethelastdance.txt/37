<A>__{sara exits with chenille. a car horn starts to blare. both of them ignore it. but it goes on like a musical number. sara gets a sinking feeling that drops like a stone when she looks across the street. roy's parked at the curb, waiting for her. she rolls her eyes and he honks again. then he waves at her. waves! chenille looks at sara. then at roy.}
