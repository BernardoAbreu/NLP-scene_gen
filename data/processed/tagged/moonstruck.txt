<A>__{several dozen loaves of golden italian bread are standing on end in a shaft of morning sunlight. they are standing on end in bins. in the window, zito's can be read in reverse. we leave the loaves and drift down to a progresso products calendar, which hangs from the wall by a nail. the month is november. various phone numbers and delivery dates have been penned in in a rough scrawl. now we go to a white formica counter, scuffed and pocked from long use. on the counter, in a rinsed out olive jar filled with water, are three fat red roses. the title appears in black script against the}

<C>__{moonstruck}
<A>__{now we faintly hear the voice of zito himself, and a low}
<B>__{tapping sound. some credits roll.}
<C>__{zito's voice}
<P>__{(barely discernable)}
<D>__{three times they cancel the order with me, and three times they come back. who they kidding? they cheap, cheap, cheap. the other bread they get is no good. they save pennies. everybody complain and they come back. "zito, your bread is the best." they're like children stupid in school who cannot learn. the water. it's the water. you buy bread in hoboken, you get hoboken water. hoboken water is dry. ask anybody who knows. ask your father. he knows.}
<A>__{during zito's plaintive words, we leave the roses and move down the counter to a calculator being tapped very efficiently with the eraser end of pencil. when the results appear, the pencil notes the figure in a threadbare old ledger.}
<B>__{now we see zito}
<A>__{he's a middle aged italian man with a kind face. but it's early in the day, and he's already been working for hours, so he's a little tired and disgruntled.}
<C>__{zito}
<D>__{you want me to make you some coffee?}
<B>__{now we see loretta for the first time}
<A>__{she's entering a few final figures in the ledger. loretta is italian, 37. her hair black, done in a dated style, is flecked with grey. she's dressed in sensible but unfashionable clothes of a dark color.}

<D>__{he looks great.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{that al conti is a genius.}
<L>__{interior office of the funeral parlor}
<A>__{first we see a name plate on a desk. the plate reads alfonso conti. we hear his voice.}
<C>__{conti's voice}
<D>__{i am a genius.}
<A>__{the shot widens to include the loaf of bread which is half cut up and being buttered. next to the bread are two steaming mugs of coffee. we hear the subdued tapping of loretta's tabulations.}
<C>__{loretta's voice}
<D>__{if you're such an artistic genius, why can't you keep track of your receipts? how am i going to do your income tax?}
<C>__{conti's voice}
<D>__{i am an artistic genius.}
<A>__{the shot widens and now we can see al conti and loretta sitting at the desk having zito's buttered bread and mugs of coffee. loretta's got her calculator going and is entering figures in al's black, gold lettered ledger.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{if you're an artistic genius, how come you got butter on your tie?}
<A>__{he looks down and sees the stain. he's at a loss.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{give it here. i will give you this, al, you make good coffee.}
<A>__{she downs her coffee, accepts the stained tie which al has taken off, and slams the ledger shut.}

<A>__{we are looking at a wall of dry cleaned clothes bags. they are hanging from an automated grid. as we watch, the wall starts to move off to the left. a gap appears where no clothes are hung. the gap creates visual frame. in the frame is robert. he is operating the grid with a little stick shift. he stops it and takes down a garment. he leaves the frame, heading off to the counter. when he moves away, we see that loretta is behind him, working her calculator, entering in a ledger. she slams the ledger shut, waves goodbye, and goes. after beat she reappears, produces conti's tie, says something to robert, who is out of view, leaves the tie, and}
<L>__{interior butcher shop day}
<A>__{we see a cleaver whacking an oxtail into section. now we see loretta, a few feet away, tabulating on a chopping block that is partially obscured by a row of hanging rabbits, unskinned.}

<A>__{now we see loretta tabulating and the florist working on the box of roses.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{the man who sends those spends a lot of money on something that ends up in the garbage can.}

<C>__{florist}
<D>__{i'm glad everybody ain't like you, loretta. i'd be outta business.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{without me, you'd be out of business. i like flowers.}
<A>__{she gives him a sudden, brief, blinding smile. it's the first time we've seen her smile. she has gold work around one of her two front teeth. the florist grunts and hands her a red rose. camera moves close to loretta and the rose.}

<A>__{with a long low moan, loretta lowers her head to the table.}
<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{ronny is walking along the same stretch of sidewalk as loretta just was. he looks like hell, too. his hair is wild and he hasn't slept. he's thrown on an old leather jacket and brown leather gloves. he has a love bite on his neck, too. he starts to sing "o soave fanciulla". he sings it any old way, occasionally getting a good attack, occasionally just muttering his way through. sings as much of it as he remembers, which is a lot.}
<B>__{we watch ronny walking from the back now}
<A>__{he's singing away, carelessly sauntering along. he passes an italian couple of middle age. they smile as they recognize what he is singing. they start to sing along with him. they sing till they get to the ceiling of the aria, and to a resting place a little beyond. then they nod to each other appreciatively and go on their ways, ronny turning his back to the camera, and they walking into it.}
<L>__{exterior the castorini house day}
<A>__{ronny appears and approaches the door. he knocks, waits, and then rings the bell. rose answers the door and invites him in.}
<L>__{interior the castorini house kitchen}

<P>__{(ignores loretta)}
<D>__{yes, i would like some oatmeal.}
<A>__{ronny and loretta sit down and rose serves them oatmeal. cosmo walks in dressed for business. he regards the trio, puts on his hat in shock and then takes it off again.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{cosmo, this is ronny, johnny's brother.}
<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{his brother.}
<A>__{cosmo sits down. rose puts a bowl of oatmeal in front of him. he absently begins to eat it. a silence reigns. then he puls down his spoon.}
<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{you're johnny's brother?}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{cosmo picks up his spoon and they all eat silently once more. the sound of dogs barking comes up and then fades away.}
<B>__{the old man walks in}
<A>__{he looks at the assemblage. the assemblage looks at him. he points at rose. then his pointing drifts to cosmo and his hand opens in a gesture of supplication.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{i am old. the old are not wanted. and what they say has no weight. but, my son, i must speak. you should pay for the wedding of your only daughter. you are breaking your house through pride. there. i've said it.}
<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{it's okay, pop. if she gets married, i will pay for the whole thing.}
<A>__{the old man lets go a great noise of relief, sits down at the table, and waits. rose brings him a bowl of oatmeal. he is content now, and eats his oatmeal with great relish. the others eat with a more meaningful silence. rose puts down her spoon. she looks at the table, but she is speaking to cosmo.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{have i been a good wife?}
<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i want you to stop seeing her.}
<A>__{everyone stops eating. a tremendous silence falls. an old clock goes tick, tick, tick. suddenly cosmo smashes his fists to the table and stands. he doesn't look at rose during this. then slowly, he sits down.}
<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{and go to confession.}
<C>__{cosmo}
<P>__{(still not looking at her)}

<A>__{she puts her hand across the table to him.}
<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{ti amo.}
<A>__{he slides his hand out and takes her hand. slowly, he lifts his eyes. their eyes meet. it's the first time he's been able to hold her gaze in this whole story. the doorbell rings.}

<D>__{it's johnny. i will get it.}
<A>__{loretta's tone is fatal.}

<C>__{rita}
<D>__{we didn't know what to think. you were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.}
<C>__{raymond}
<P>__{(a sudden outburst to loretta)}
