<L>__{exterior field day}
<A>__{we're close on bateman as he lines up for the kick off. everybody in the stadium knows that an on side kick is coming. bateman is standing in the hot spot for recovering the ball. shane and everyone with decent hands is on the field. pacifico lines it up and boots it ten yards. the ball takes a crazy hop, hits a giant, and ricochets off him. bateman runs over two guys and grabs the ball on the bounce. he's got it. but bateman doesn't go down. he turns and starts running across the field. shane runs after him.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{no! danny, go down! you're using up the clock!}
<A>__{but bateman likes this new job: kick off returner! especially after he runs over a giant and stiff arms another. bateman is finally trapped on the far sideline after gaining perhaps eight yards. so, he turns and starts running back the other way. shane has been chasing him and now sees bateman running back at him. shane has no choice but to throw himself in front of bateman's legs. bateman goes down. shane jumps up:}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(to ref)}
<D>__{time out!}
<A>__{bateman looks up at shane.}
<C>__{bateman}
<D>__{beautiful tackle, shane!}
<C>__{summerall}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{now that's something you don't see everyday!}
<B>__{on clock}
<A>__{bateman has burned up most of the clock. eighteen seconds remain.}
<B>__{on sideline}
<A>__{mcginty, shane and pacifico confer.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{we got time for one play, but if we don't get it out of bounds, the game is over. mcginty yeah, but you're looking at a sixty five yard kick from here.}
<C>__{pacifico}
<P>__{(smoking a butt)}
<D>__{no problem.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{seriously?}
<C>__{pacifico}
<P>__{(to shane)}
<D>__{you hold it. i will kick it.}
<A>__{mcginty looks at shane and they both shrug.}
<D>__{mcginty what the fuck.}
<B>__{on summerall and madden}
<A>__{madden can't believe it.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{i can't believe it! mcginty is gonna let pacifico try the field goal from sixty five yards out!}
<C>__{summerall}
<D>__{hey, john, this kid has got a heck of a foot.}
<C>__{stram}
<D>__{but sixty five yards? come on!}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{he's set up to receive the snap. pacifico lines himself up the way soccer style kickers do. then he takes a drag on his smoke, and flicks it away.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{pat... did he just? i think that guy is smoking on the field!}
<C>__{summerall}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{no, i think you imagined that one, john.}
<A>__{shane looks at pacifico and his clean uniform. then shane looks at his own uniform which is covered with blood, dirt, and grass stains. pacifico looks clean.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{you look great, lou, you know that?}
<A>__{pacifico is really touched.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{really? thanks, shane. that means a lot to me.}
<A>__{shane turns to evans who smiles at him between his own legs.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{hut!}
<A>__{the snap is perfect. pacifico boots the shit out of it.}
<B>__{on ball}
<A>__{end over end, yard after yard, it flies straight and true.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{it's straight enough! if it's got the distance, it's...}
<A>__{the ball hits the crossbar and goes over.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{good! redskins win!}
<A>__{everybody goes crazy. players are pounding on pacifico. but pacifico is desperately looking around for someone. he spots him: it's bateman running flat out across the field to congratulate him. pacifico runs for his life.}
