<L>__{interior back room of sam's hardware store in fairvale (day)}
<A>__{sam is seated at his desk, writing a letter. sequence begins with camera in close, over sam's shoulder, and we can read as mush as he has written of the letter. the letterhead reads "sam loomis hardware," and the letter reads: "dearest right as always mary: i'm sitting in this tiny back room which isn't big enough for both of us, and suddenly it looks big enough for both of us. so what if we're poor and cramped and miserable, at least we'll be happy! if you haven't come to your senses, and still want to... camera begins pulling away as sam turns the sheet of paper over, continues backing away out of the small back room and heads, backwards, down the corridor, we see a young clerk, bob summerfield, sam's assistant, standing behind the counter, a look of handsome patience on his face. he is waiting on a meticulous, elderly woman customer, who is holding and examining a large can of insecticide. as camera passes:}
<C>__{woman customer}
<D>__{...they tell you what its ingredients are and how it's guaranteed to exterminate any insect in the world, but they do not tell you whether or not it's painless. and i say insect or man, death should always be painless.}
<A>__{camera, by this has reached the front door of the hardware store and we now see a girl standing just inside the door. she is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner, a look of purposefulness. she carries a handbag and a small overnight case. she is mary's sister, lila crane. bob summerfield has noticed lila, smiles brightly at her, gives her an i will be with you in a moment nod. lila starts to walk toward the counter, never taking her eyes off bob. as she approaches, she asks quietly:}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{sam?}
<C>__{summerfield}
<D>__{you want to see sam?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{sam loomis.}
<C>__{summerfield}
<P>__{(yelling toward back room)}
<D>__{sam! lady wants to see you!}
<A>__{lila looks to the back room. the woman customer goes on worriedly examining the fine print of the insecticide can. sam comes to the door of his room, pauses, looks at lila a moment, starts toward her, his expression indicating that he does not know her. lila studies him with a quiet, worried expression.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{may i talk to you?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(a bit mystified)}
<D>__{sure...}
<A>__{lila glances at the customer and the clerk, turns, starts toward the front of the store. sam holds a moment, then follows. as he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him intently as she says:}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i'm mary's sister.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{lila.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{is mary here?}
<A>__{sam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile expression on lila's face. he studies her for a quiet moment. behind them is a display of various size carving knives.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{is something wrong?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i want to know if my sister is here.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{here?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{with you.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i don't know where. in your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{don't you know?}
<A>__{as sam is about to speak, the woman customer comes sailing past, speaking as she goes and wearing a satisfied smile.}
<C>__{woman customer}
<D>__{all i can do is hope if it isn't painless, it's quick!}
<A>__{she speaks "quick" with a kind of delicious bite, nods happily, goes on out of the store. sam is now staring apprehensively at lila.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what should i know?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{to begin with, where mary is. do you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no. i take it you don't either?}
<P>__{(as lila shakes her head)}
<D>__{how long?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{last friday. she left work, and home... i was in tucson over the weekend... i haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and you thought she'd come up here, to me? if she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{a good reason, i suppose.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(slightly exasperated)}
<D>__{well what do you think, we eloped or something? or we're living in sin and...}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{mr. loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. mary is missing.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i was getting to that!}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{what do you know about it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{nothing! you're putting me on the defensive.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{look, if you two are in this thing together, i don't care, it's none of my business... but i want to see mary. i want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. then i will go back to phoenix and...}
<A>__{she stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes beginning to fill with worried tears. sam studies her for a moment, then turns and calls:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{bob? run out and get yourself some lunch.}
<C>__{summerfield}
<D>__{it's okay, sam, i brought it with me.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{run out and eat it.}
<A>__{bob gets the message, goes out through the back way. sam goes closer to lila, speaks with soft seriousness.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what thing?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what thing could we be in together?}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{i hate tears.}
<P>__{(takes out hankie)}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{is mary... in trouble?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well why didn't she come to me... call me...?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{not that kind...}
<P>__{(almost a smile)}
<D>__{you men and your egos.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{never mind my ego. let's talk about mary.}
<A>__{their attention is distracted by a man who has strolled quietly into the room. he ignores them, walks past them, goes behind the counter, takes down a sign reading "closed for lunch," walks back to the door, closes door, hangs the sign across the door window, locks the door, turns to sam and lila, folds his arms, smiles a particularly unfriendly smile.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{let's all talk about mary.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{who are you, friend?}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{milt arbogast, private investigator.}
<P>__{(to lila)}
<D>__{where is she, miss crane?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's your interest?}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{money.}
<A>__{there is a moment's silence and then, unable to tolerate the sudden frightening happenings, sam explodes.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! i can take so much and then...}
<C>__{arbogast}
<P>__{(interrupting calmly)}
<D>__{your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.}
<A>__{sam looks at arbogast in utter shock and in that state asks one of those seemingly ridiculous questions.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{arbogast}
<P>__{(an almost amused smile)}
<D>__{must've needed it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<P>__{(to lila)}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{she was supposed to bank it, on friday, for her boss. she didn't.}
<A>__{and no one has seen her since.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<P>__{(looking at sam)}
<D>__{someone has seen her. someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{she is your girl friend, isn't she?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. it was all in cash...}
<C>__{arbogast}
<P>__{(correcting with cassidy's word)}
<D>__{casharoonie!}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{sam, if she's here...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{she isn't!}
<A>__{a real look of anguish comes into lila's face. and arbogast studies it, then speaks.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{you came up here on a hunch, miss crane? nothing more? no phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{not even a hunch. just hope.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{with a little checking, i could get to believe you.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(anxiously)}
<D>__{i don't care if you do or... i want to see mary... before she gets in any deeper...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{did you check in phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold up...}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{she was seen leaving town in her car. seen by her very victims, i might add.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{i don't believe it.}
<P>__{(to lila, slowly)}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(a thoughtful pause)}
<D>__{yes... i just... did. the moment they told me...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you might have doubted for say five minutes or so, sister.}
<A>__{lila turns from sam, a flush of guilt and regret in her face. arbogast looks at her, quiet sympathetically.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{we're always quickest to doubt people who have a record for being honest. i think she's here, miss crane. where there's a boyfriend...}
<P>__{(trails off, smiles encouragingly)}
<D>__{she won't be back there among the nuts and bolts... but she'll be in this town... somewhere. i will find her.}
<A>__{he nods, takes down the closed for lunch sign, sails it to the counter, opens door, goes out into the street. after a quiet moment:}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'she stole the money.' 'we don't want to get her in trouble.' 'no don't bring the police in'...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{no. the man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and i... i should've called the police.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... all that cash...}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i ought to call the police right now!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{why not? sam, is she hiding here? are you two planning to go away with the money?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{how could i go away? i'm in debt up to my...}
<P>__{(smiles at the}
<D>__{incongruity of his reply, then goes}
<P>__{serious)}
<D>__{if she did steal that money... it's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{she haven't even called you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i didn't see her... and i didn't hear from her! believe that!}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i need to... i need to believe something. this is the first time i've ever come up against anything i couldn't... understand.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you've led a charmed life.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{no. i just think... anything can be explained. but mary, doing a thing like this... i don't know how to handle...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{maybe we can handle it together.}
<P>__{(he smiles encouragingly)}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(a rueful shrug)}
<D>__{i came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all i know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. i'd better go home.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(a thoughtful pause)}
<D>__{i think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. why don't you stay here. when she shows up... or calls... be here.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(a long study, her}
<D>__{suspicion of him}
<P>__{evaporating)}
<D>__{you want me to stay here?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{she'll need both of us.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(considers, then:)}
<D>__{where... can i stay?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{first rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. come on.}
<P>__{(as he reaches for}
<D>__{the closed for lunch}
<P>__{sign)}
<D>__{after we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. then we'll come back here... and wait.}
<A>__{he hangs the sign on the door, ushers lila out, closes door behind him.}
