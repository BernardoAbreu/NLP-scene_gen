<L>__{interior hattori hanzo's attic day}
<A>__{the trap door in the floor opens up, and hattori hanzo (sushi chef), climbs inside the room, followed by the bride. the room has many handcrafted samurai swords in hand carved wooden sheaths resting on wooden racks running the length of the second half of the attic. the bride walks down the row of japanese steel, looking and touching the shiny wood. she looks behind her to hanzo who is still by the trap door, and says;}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{the sushi chef answers in english;}
<C>__{hanzo }
<D>__{yes you may.....}
<A>__{she starts reaching for one...}
<C>__{hanzo }
<D>__{...try the second one down in the sixth row on your left.}
<A>__{she finds it lying sleeping in its shiny, black sheath. her hand lifts it from the rack. she unsheaths the steel, partially....then with great flourish....completely. hanzo's mouth froms a smile.}
<C>__{hanzo }
<D>__{funny, you like samurai swords...}
<A>__{he pulls a baseball out of his pocket.}
<C>__{hanzo }
<D>__{...i like baseball.}
<A>__{then suddenly he throws the baseball hard, right at the bride's head.... quick as a whip, she slices the ball in half, in mid air. the two perfectly cut baseball pieces, hit the floor. he gives her a slight nod, then crosses the attic towards her.}
<C>__{hanzo }
<D>__{i wanted to show you these.... however someone as you, who knows so much must surely know, i no longer make instruments of death. i keep these here for their ascetic and sentimental value.}
<P>__{(he takes both sword and sheath from her...)}
<D>__{yet proud tho i am of my life's work...}
<P>__{(...he closes them together)}
<D>__{i am retired.}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{then give me one of these.}
<C>__{hanzo }
<D>__{these are not for sale.}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{i didn't say, sell me. i said, give me.}
<C>__{hanzo }
<D>__{and why should i be obliged to assist you in the extermination of your vermin?}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{because my vermin, is a former student of yours. and considering the student, i'd say you had a rather large obligation.}
<A>__{hattori hanzo goes to a dusty window, and writes the name, "bill" on it with his finger. the blonde girl nods her head yes. the proud warrior moves over to the door in the floor, throwing it open. he points into a corner...}
<C>__{hanzo }
<D>__{...you can sleep there...}
<A>__{.....starts to descend....}
<C>__{hanzo }
<D>__{...it will take me a week to make the sword...}
<A>__{.....before his head disappears, he says;}
<C>__{hanzo }
<D>__{...i suggest you spend it practicing.}
<A>__{...he closes the door behind him. she smiles slightly...then moves over to the window, takes out a handkerchief, and wipes bill's name off.}
