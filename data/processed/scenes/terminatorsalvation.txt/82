<A>__{marcus is marched down the corridor to the launch tube, frankenstein like, morrison holding the chains, keeping a safe distance from him, while barnes keeps the rpg trained at marcus' head. marcus shuffles awkwardly, the bolts hampering his ankles. it's reminiscent of his death walk at film's opening.}

<D>__{nothing. los angeles is sending a chopper seems you're some kind of vip.}
<A>__{they reach the edge of the silo pit a long drop, smooth walls, a long metal ladder leading down into darkness. marcus pauses by the ladder, holds up his bolted arms questioningly "now what?" at a look from morrison, he and barnes body check marcus at once, sending him flying over the edge marcus falls the thirty feet or so, strikes the concrete floor of the launch tube with a sickening thud, the chains clattering down around him. marcus is stunned, barely conscious as the ladder is pulled upward. it's like the bottom of a well, twenty feet in diameter, sheer concrete walls, the floor blackened from a rocket blast. angle up his captors look down at him for a moment, then move out of view.}
