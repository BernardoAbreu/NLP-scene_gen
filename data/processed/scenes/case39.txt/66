<A>__{the second person:}
<D>__{coworker #2 wayne wants to }
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{got it.}
<A>__{she comes past wayne's office. empty. a coworker points over toward emily's cubicle he's there. she goes over. wayne's inside, grave faced, looking for a file. he finds it on the shelf. a photo of eight year old diego clipped inside the cover. the boy we met earlier.}

<D>__{what's up with diego?}
<A>__{wayne hesitates, wanting to spare her the bad news.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{why don't we talk in my office.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{tell me what's going on.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{we don't know why yet, but... he killed his mother and father last night.}
