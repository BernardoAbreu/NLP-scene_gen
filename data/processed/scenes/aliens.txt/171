<A>__{newt, standing waist deep in the water, watches sparks shower blindingly as hicks cuts. she bites her lip, trembling. cold and terrified. silently a glistening shape rises in one graceful motion from the water behind her. it stands, dripping, dwarfing her tiny form. newt turns, sensing the movement...she screams as the shadow engulfs her.}
<L>__{interior service tunnel}
<A>__{ripley panics, hearing screaming below, then splashing. she and hicks kick desperately at the grating, smashing it down. heedless of the cherry hot edges ripley lunges into the hole with her light.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{newt! newt!}
<A>__{the surface of the water reflects the beam placidly. newt is gone. bobbing in the water, eyes staring, is "casey" the doll head. in sinks slowly, distorting, vanishing in darkness. hicks pulls ripley away from the hole. she struggles furiously, trying to tear out of his grip.}

<D>__{no! noooo!}
<A>__{he drags her back. it takes all of his strength.}

<D>__{she's gone! let's go!}
<A>__{he sees something moving toward them through a lattice of pipes. ripley is irrational. hysterical.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{no! no! she's alive! we have to }
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{all right! she's alive. i believe it. but we gotta get moving! now!}
<A>__{he drags her toward an elevator not far away at the end of the tunnel. gets her inside, slamming her against the back wall. hits the button to go to surface level. an alien warrior leaps into the tunnel, starts toward them. the doors are closing. not fast enough. the creature gets one arm through, the doors closing on it. they open again, an automatic safety feature. the warrior hisses, lunging. hicks fires, point blank. it spins away, screeching. acid sluices between the closing doors, across hicks' armored chest plate, as he shields ripley with his body. the lift starts upward. hicks' fingers race with the clasps as the stuff eats its way toward his skin. galvanized out of her hysteria, ripley claws at his armor, helping him as much as she can. he screams as the acid contacts his chest and arm. he shucks out of the combat armor like a madman, dropping the smoking pieces to the floor. acrid fumes fill the air, searing eyes and lungs. the elevator stops. the doors part and they stumble out, ripley supporting hicks who is doubled over in agony.}
