<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{wrong answer, mister picard. try again.}

<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{truth... he's telling the truth...}
<A>__{picard looks at ruby, and at that moment something on a console behind her catches his eye: a light on beverly's surgical transporter is now flashing. no one else notices.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{you're an entertaining man, mister picard. but you're also full of shit.}
<A>__{scrimm cocks back the hammer on the pistol he's holding to ruby's head. the following happens very quickly : picard reaches out his hand, trying to stop scrimm.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{now, geordi!}

<D>__{actually, you're full of shit.}
<A>__{everyone is in the room stunned by what's happened. picard takes charge before anyone can recover.}

<A>__{there's a beat, but then scrimm sees he has little choice.}
<C>__{scrimm}
<D>__{weapons... down.}
<A>__{the other militia soldiers drop their weapons, which are quickly picked up by beverly and a starfleet n.d. picard hands his gun to lange, who covers scrimm with it. ruby turns to picard.}

<D>__{are you all }
<A>__{ruby throws her arms around him and pulls him close. he hugs her back, grateful she's alive. ruby pulls away.}
