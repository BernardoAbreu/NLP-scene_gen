<A>__{eric dale walks out the front door carrying the file boxes. there are other people streaming out the door doing the same thing. eric stops, turns, and looks up at the building then tries to make a phone call but his phone does not work as it has been shut off by the firm. he looks up to the sky and can't believe his fate. as he looks down he sees a woman, sarah robertson, serious, classically beautiful and dressed in a well tailored power suit with her head down walking into the building. he can't help himself.}
