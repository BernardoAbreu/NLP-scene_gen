<A>__{the nyu band plays pomp and circumstance as the graduating class of `09 enters the field in caps and gowns. all the families in the bleachers are on their feet, applauding. angle the adlers jane, in sunglasses, is sobbing, taking photos. next to her are gabby, harley and lauren, hooting, clapping and screaming, "there he is!!!" and next in line is jake manning the video camera, wiping away tears. on the field, luke spots his gang in the bleachers and gives a broad bow. the adlers go crazy, especially jane, who does a finger whistle. jake looks over at jane with puppy dog eyes. the girls notice, assuming their dad is emotional over the ceremony. jane feels jake's glare but won't dare look over at him. gabby nudges her mom to look over at dad. jane turns his way, sees that look in his eyes and starts to bawl.}
