<LOC>__{EXT. FARMLAND - DAWN}
<ACTION>__{IN BLACK AND WHITE, A black 1930s Cadillac speeds down the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland. The road curves sharply ahead - the car accelerates. Ignoring the turn, the Caddy drives directly off the road and through a massive field of emptiness. The car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field. GENERAL BRAT (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and AGENT BLACK SUIT (an agent in a black suit) step out of the car. Although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the General scans his surroundings with concern. TITLE CARD UP: THE PAST Agent Black Suit crouches down and pulls open a METAL HATCH in the ground. Both men walk down the hatch and into the earth.}

<ACTION>__{The three men enter a large room divided by a one-way mirror. On their side, numerous SCIENTISTS, utilizing several archaic devices, are busy at work monitoring the subject on the other side of the mirror. The subject: PRIVATE MILLER (22, naive and dutiful) sits at a small table with a microphone on it. Miller raises his hand, REVEALING a smoldering JOINT. He takes a long and awkward hit from the joint and bursts into a coughing fit. The scientists begin to scribble profusely as their devices blink manically. General Brat and Agent Black Suit exchange a concerned look. The General lights a cigarette as the Scientist steps up to a small microphone in the corner.}

Dale watches in horror as a LARGE GREY-HAIRED MAN and the Female Cop step forward and shoot the Asian man! BLAM! BLAM! Blood splatters! Dale starts COUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY! He starts the car and, in a panicked fit, tries to pull out. CRASH!!! He smashes directly into the car in front of him! He flicks the roach out onto the grass and slams the car in reverse - CRUNCH!!! He backs into the car behind him! Still hacking his lungs out, Dale drives away! The Grey-Haired Man and the Female Cop sprint out of the house in time to see Dale's distant tail lights vanish into the darkness. Something catches the Grey-Haired Man's eye - a trail of smoke rising from the grass. He lowers his blood-stained hand and picks up...DALE'S ROACH!

<CHAR>__{RED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{SAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't worry, man. Look at Evander Holyfield, he looks totally normal. And plus, I saw this thing on the Discovery Channel, they can actually grow ears, like, in a petri dish, or even on the side of a mouse. And you only need half of one. It'll be a fuckin' cinch.}
