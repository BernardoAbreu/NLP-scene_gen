<L>__{interior hospital, charleston. day}
<A>__{inman lies; bandaged, eyes closed, in the ballroom of a colonial mansion, co opted as one ward of a confederate hospital. rows of beds, the wounded and the dying, are lodged between some vestiges of the room's former glory. some local women, conscious of their duty to the cause, are brought through by an exhausted doctor, who's lost all his grace. the windows are open, but it's still insufferably hot, the muslin curtains barely moving.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{most of these men will be dead by the morning or, if they're stubborn, by nightfall. i have other men outside in the quadrangle waiting for the beds.}
<A>__{the women try to process this, the attitude.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{so, any kind word will be a blessing.}
<A>__{one woman is overpowered by the stench, gags.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{it's the heat. i'm sorry. they rot.}
<A>__{the women begin to approach the beds.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{don't pray. if they're not god fearing you can stir up a hornet's nest.}
<A>__{mrs. morgan, nervous, decent, sits next to inman. his mouth is moving. she doesn't know what he's saying.}
<C>__{mrs. morgan}
<D>__{i'm sorry, you want water?}
<A>__{she bends to him again. his voice is a faint croak.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{pigeon river. little east fork.}
<A>__{the doctor is on his exit, stops at the bed.}
<C>__{mrs. morgan}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i don't know what he's saying.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{they ramble. names of loved ones.}
<C>__{mrs. morgan}
<P>__{(listening to inman)}
<D>__{pigeon river. is that a place? cold mountain?}
<A>__{the doctor shrugs, not a detective, moves on, stops at the man in the next bed. has a brief look, calls to a nurse.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{this man is dead.}
