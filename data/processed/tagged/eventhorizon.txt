<A>__{to discern the hard angles of a man made craft. a ship. no longer dwarfed by the planet, the scale of the vessel emerges: a vast labyrinth of steel. its shadow swallows all in darkness.}

<L>__{interior event horizon bridge}
<A>__{a cockpit for three. neptune's blue light fills the chamber, reflects off immobile particles in the air. thick quartz windows look down at neptune. the cockpit lights are dark but for one blinking red light. an emergency beacon. under floor lights go on. the strobe of the red light reveals a man floating at the helm, slowly spinning. he is dead, perfectly preserved in the cold vacuum of space. his eyes are empty black pits and his mouth hangs open in a scream: dr. william weir.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior studio apartment}
<A>__{weir opens his eyes, waking from dream. sweat beads his ascetic, etched face. many years a scientist. he turns on the bedside lamp, revealing a couple's apartment. decorated by a woman, but weir is alone, unless you count photographs. his nightstand looks like a shrine to a beautiful woman. weir reaches to the stand. picks up... recent, unframed photo the woman appears thin and haggard and wears a small brave smile. weir lies back on the bed. looks at the photo. presses it to his forehead and closes his eyes. trying to be with her, just one more time.}

<P>__{(whisper)}
<D>__{i miss you.}
<L>__{interior studio apartment later}
<A>__{weir stands in front of the bathroom mirror, shaving with a straight razor. the mirror reveals the bathtub just behind him. drip, drip, drip... weir turns to stare at the bathtub. water wells up at the mouth of the tub's faucet, grows impossibly large, falls...}

<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior daylight office}
<A>__{a military office, united states aerospace command seal blazoned on the door. views of the earth. admiral hollis sits behind his desk, a gruff career officer and a good man. weir enters, escorted by hollis' adjutant, lyle.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{you wanted to see me, admiral?}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{i apologize for the short notice, bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. lyle?}
<L>__{interior holographic display of the solar system}
<A>__{lyle activates a holographic display of the solar system. a box magnifies the eighth planet, neptune, revealing a flashing red dot in its orbit.}
<L>__{interior daylight office}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{at oh three hundred this morning, tdrss picked up an automated navigation beacon broadcasting at two minute intervals in neptune orbit.}
<A>__{lyle hands weir a stack of hardcopy data. weir reads the data with growing excitement.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{incredible... these are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? this isn't some kind of hoax?}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{i wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. houston confirms the telemetry and i.d. codes.}
<C>__{weir}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{it's the event horizon. she's come back.}
<A>__{hollis answers drily.}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{that ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. if the titanic sailed into new york harbor, i'd find it more plausible.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{houston wants aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. if it really is the event horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{a written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. i have to go with them.}
<A>__{lyle looks at weir, stunned by the request.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{dr. weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{i designed the ship's propulsion system. i am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. you can't send a search and rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. that would be like... like sending an auto mechanic to work on the shuttle.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{i can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, dr. weir, but it doesn't factor into this.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{this is not about my reputation! this is not about me at all!}
<P>__{(beat, passionate)}
<D>__{the event horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. we lost the dream.}
<P>__{(beat, quiet and relentless)}
<D>__{i have to go.}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{it's not that simple.}
<P>__{(off of weir's expression)}
<D>__{lyle, play the recording for dr. weir.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{navigation control tried to hail the vessel. this was the only response.}
<A>__{lyle presses a button on hollis' desk. an unholy garble rips from office speakers: static and noise and inhuman voices. alone, each sound would raise the hair on your neck. together, they are unbearable. the sound mercifully cuts off to static. lyle stops the tape. weir sits there, stunned.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. just the beacon, every two minutes.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{the crew? could they still be alive?}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{the ship had life support systems for eighteen months. they're been gone seven years.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{someone sent that message. admiral, you have to put me on that ship.}
<A>__{hollis stares at weir, judging the man with his eyes.}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{it's against my better judgement, but i will run this by the man downstairs. you'll know my decision by the end of the day.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{don't thank me, bill. i'm not doing you any favors.}
<A>__{weir leaves. the door closes behind him.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{you're not seriously considering sending him?}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{you don't just dismiss bill weir. the man held oppenheimer's chair at princeton. if the event horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since einstein.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{the official inquiry blamed weir's design for the ship's loss.}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{that doesn't mean a damn thing. they were looking for a scapegoat and weir fit the bill. but he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{does he know that?}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{what's on your mind?}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{he doesn't belong on this mission. responsible or not, he blames himself. he's too close to it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and then there's his wife.}
<C>__{hollis}
<D>__{it's been two years since she died. he's over it.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{some things you don't get over.}

<C>__{weir}
<D>__{relativity, yes. we can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. the ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space time consistent with weyl tensor dynamics until the space time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...}

<C>__{weir}
<D>__{say this paper represents space time, and you want to get from "point a" here...}

<A>__{weir folds the paper, lining up point a over point b... then thrusting his pen through both, skewering the pin up.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{...is zero. that's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point a and point b coexist in the same space and time. after the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.}

<C>__{justin}
<D>__{so if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{it was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. the event horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. they received the go ahead to activate the gravity drive.}
