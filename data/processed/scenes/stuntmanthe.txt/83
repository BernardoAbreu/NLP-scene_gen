<L>__{interior bell tower night}
<A>__{it is crowded with bells, a small walkway and railing surrounded them. the city lights are seen beyond. below are the sheds where crewmen are preparing the next day's shooting. just beyond is the overwhelming silhouette of the huge crane. nina and cameron reach the top of the stairs winded and laughing, as they rush to the railing and lean over. nina gasps, clutching cameron in genuine fright.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(gasps)}
<D>__{oh, my god! it's terrifying! you can't jump from this...you'll get killed! it's crazy!...}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{...it's not that bad. it looks worse at night... chuck says it's like robbing a candy store.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(getting angry)}
<D>__{now stop that! ...i'm going back.}
<A>__{she whirls to go. he stops her, taking her by the shoulders.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{...what's wrong?}
<A>__{her concern for him has turned to anger, like a mother slapping her child for running in the street.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{it's just dumb...to strut around trying to talk brave...}
<A>__{his arm still restrains her. she takes hold of it, then suddenly softens with a look of slight surprise.}
<C>__{nina }
<D>__{oh...you are scared...aren't you?}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{not really.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{yes. you are...you're trembling.}
<A>__{after a moment, he answers quietly.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{so are you...and you're not even gonna jump.}
<A>__{it's true. she is trembling and so is he not from fear. he slowly draws her toward him, her mouth reaching up to his. and then they are devouring each other. abruptly, they're illuminated by a fierce blast of white light. they separate and stare, blinking in shock and confusion.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{okay, hit two and three.}
<A>__{they are pinned in the crossbeams of two more giant arcs. quickly she yanks him down with her out of sight behind the railing.}
