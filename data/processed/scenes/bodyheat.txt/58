<L>__{interior matty's bedroom night}
<A>__{racine and matty are in bed. matty is sound asleep, her back close to racine. but he is not asleep. he is propped up, looking down at her. we've never seen his face like this before. never this open, never so much in repose. she stirs, and then is still again. he touches her hair lightly. she sleeps.}
<L>__{interior stella's coffee shop day}
<A>__{same courthouse cop crowd as before. racine finishes a sandwich at a table as lowenstein sits down with two tall glasses of iced coffee, both of which he drinks down.}

<A>__{racine dismisses this with a gesture.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{you've never been shy about that stuff.}
<A>__{at this moment, detective oscar grace, a big, powerful black man comes in. he's a plainclothes cop in shirt sleeves, his jacket in his hand. as he passes racine on his way to the third seat at the table, he squeezes racine's shoulders with his huge hands, by way of greeting.}

<D>__{oscar.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{hey. you weren't at the y last week. we lost.}

<C>__{racine}
<D>__{there's nothing to tell. i lead a lonely life.}
<C>__{grace}

<D>__{...stella!}
<A>__{stella arrives with grace's order. lowenstein looks her over as a possible for racine, but shakes his head. stella lingers. lowenstein spots someone, speaks to racine in a loud, excited whisper.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{i know, i know you finally got to glenda.}
<A>__{across the restaurant, glenda, a meter maid, is talking with some other women.}

<C>__{grace}
<D>__{real good. always starts hoppin' in weather like this. when it gets hot, people try to kill each other.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{it's true. i could tell you some people who'll be dead if we don't get a break soon.}
<A>__{she leaves. the three men exchange amused looks.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{we've got more of everything bad since the wave started. it's the crisis atmosphere. people dress different, feel different, sweat more. they wake up cranky and they never recover. look at lowenstein.}
<P>__{(a flash of smile)}
<D>__{things are just a little askew. pretty soon people think the old rules aren't in effect. they start breaking them. figure no one'll care, cause it's emergency time... time out.}
<A>__{he takes a big bite of pie.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{oscar, i just don't understand how you could be doing advanced theoretical thinking like that and still be stuck working in our little town.}
