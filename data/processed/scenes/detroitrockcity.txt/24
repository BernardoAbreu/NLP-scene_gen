<L>__{interior girls' bathroom day}
<A>__{trip kicks a bathroom stall violently.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{fuck! shit!}
<A>__{lex sits on the toilet in the stall.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{hey, take it easy, man. this is the girls' crapper, remember?}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{wake up, lex! we just watched jam's mom torch our fuckin' kiss tickets! not reo speedwagon! not journey! not the bay city rollers! kiss! if you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, i'd sure like to hear it!}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? quit acting all squeezed out.}
<A>__{trip grabs lex by the collar, yanks him off the toilet and shoves him against the wall.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{oh, everything's hunky dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! you fuckin' jinxed us!}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{smug, trip! not snug, smug.}
<A>__{hawk bursts into the bathroom.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{we're clear, dudes.}
<A>__{they run to exit. hawk first. suddenly, hawk backs up again into trip and lex as if a swarm of killer bees was out there.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{a skirt just came around the corner.}
<A>__{hawk, trip, and lex run back and pile into the last stall. all three stand on the toilet bracing their arms against the walls for balance. a foxy girl hurries into the stall next to theirs. we see the top halves of three heads peek over the stall's partition. the three boys don't make a sound as they watch her sit down. as she glances up, they recoil fast. they whisper super quiet.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{that's sherry vanhafton.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i've been in love with her since the second grade.}
<A>__{then, a sound of tinkling. they all throw their hands over their mouths to stifle the giggles. suddenly, poot! she lets out an echoed fart. the boys are awestruck.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{whoa... she just farted.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{weird...}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{peeeyeewww! that stinks!}
<A>__{just then, the sound of cracking porcelain, as the toilet they're standing on breaks into pieces with a smash. they topple over pulling the stall walls down with them exposing the foxy chick sitting on the can. water gushes everywhere as she screams bloody murder, getting doused ruining her farrah do. they bolt out the door slipping and sliding across the torrent of toilet water. lex turns and shrugs to the traumatized girl.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{heh heh, sorry.}
<A>__{he's gone.}
<D>__{caller 106 elvis attacks}
