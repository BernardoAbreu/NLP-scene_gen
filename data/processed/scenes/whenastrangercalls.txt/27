<L>__{interior study day}
<A>__{a man is sitting behind a desk which faces the door. presumably he is the master of the house. although his face is hidden in shadows, we can see from his hands that he is engaged in writing something down. clifford quietly approaches the desk and takes a seat in front of it. then, vaguely in keeping with the spirit of the house, he waits to be spoken to rather than interrupt the pervasive stillness. after a moment, the master of the house lays down his pen and leans back in his chair. pause.}
<C>__{master}
<D>__{so you're in business for yourself now.}
<C>__{clifford}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{yes, sir, for the past three and a half years.}
<C>__{master}
<D>__{that's good.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and you'd heard about curt duncan's escape?}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{oh, yes.}
<C>__{master}
<D>__{do you think the police will... find him?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{i know they haven't assigned anyone to it specifically. it's an old case.}
<C>__{master}
<P>__{(a tinge of bitterness)}
<D>__{an old case.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can you find him?}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{yes. maybe not tomorrow, maybe not this week, but i will find him.}
<C>__{master}
<D>__{he could be anywhere by now.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{i don't think so... because he's a foreigner. he'll come back to the city. after six years in confinement, it's the only place that's familiar to him. that's important.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{master}
<D>__{a man murders two children in cold blood. a jury declares him insane. how could such a person not be?}
<A>__{clifford lowers his eyes, doesn't answer.}
<C>__{master}
<D>__{he is sent to a state mental institution where the security is... less than perfect. and he escapes. it... it isn't fair.}
<A>__{the master of the house leans way forward over his desk, and his face comes out of the shadows and into the light. it is dr. mandrakis. he seems much older. his complexion is pallid. his eyes stare out from beneath his brow like a wounded animal hiding in a dark cave.}
<C>__{mandrakis}
<D>__{a thing like that should never be allowed to happen again.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{i couldn't agree with you more.}
<A>__{they look at each other for a long moment of acknowledgment. then mandrakis stands up with a sigh.}
<C>__{mandrakis}
<D>__{go ahead then. my accountant will contact you.}
<A>__{clifford stands and they shake hands.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how is mrs. mandrakis?}
<C>__{mandrakis}
<D>__{she is... unable to have any more children.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{i'm sorry. please give her my best.}
<C>__{mandrakis}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{clifford turns to go.}
