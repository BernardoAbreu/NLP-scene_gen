<L>__{interior ferry terminal night}
<A>__{dean walks down the ramp. it's dark in the empty terminal. not the best place at this hour. up ahead, two men stand in the darkness, then kissing. down another hall, sounds of nearing footsteps. dean detours into }
<L>__{interior men's room continuous}
<A>__{empty. dean stands at a sink, water running. he glances at the door. he splashes water on his face. suddenly dean's slammed forward, a silenced pistol is shoved into his ear, pinning his face to the mirror.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{jesus! what?! you want money?!}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{shut the fuck up.}
<A>__{hands frisk dean. up and down the legs, behind the back and chest. a wallet is removed, id's looked at then returned. dean turns to see a man, early 50's. he sweeps a signal frequency locator over dean's body. the needle reacts at dean's foot.}

<P>__{(prying away dean's heel)}
<D>__{my name doesn't matter.}
<A>__{close on dean's heel a hollow compartment reveals a miniature tracking device. the man removes it, then returns the shoe.}
<P>__{"brill" (cont'd)}
<D>__{a tracker. thousand yard range. they're close.}
<A>__{the man reaches in a trash can, removes a potato chip bag, wraps it around the tracker and flushes it down the toilet.}
<P>__{"brill" (cont'd)}
<D>__{c'mon.}
<A>__{"brill" goes through the window. dean eyes the window, not sure. he eyes the door. same feeling.}
