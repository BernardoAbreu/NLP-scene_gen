<L>__{interior diner dusk}
<A>__{the three of them are walking to a booth in the diner. ray, with rachel in his arms, is beginning to bleed from his head wound. he walks with a slight limp. rachel is panic stricken. robbie lets go of his bloody nose and, with both hands, clenches his chest in pain. he is still fighting to catch his breath. they are all soaked from the rain. they all sit down at the booth. the power is flickering on and off. as they begin to relax from the ordeal they just had, gunshots are heard. bam!! bam!! ray jumps and catches his head in his hands as it throbs. robbie jumps and flails his arms in pain as the jump tightened muscles in his stomach. robbie turns around to see the man with ray's gun firing at riot man 3. bam! one more gunshot is heard. rachel scurries over to robbie who, despite his pain, grabs rachel and they hug each other seeking comfort. the van drives away. rachel sobs as ray also starts crying because nobody knows what to do from here. robbie looks at ray for some comfort. he has none. walking down the street dusk they are walking in a crowd of about 300. some men share their stories of assumption. one man says... "europe's got it the worst...." while another man says "we've got it the worst......" while some people "don't give a shit who it is....."}

<A>__{a rail road crossing guard stick comes down as the bells and lights start going off. the people stand behind the guard just like cars. they wait. a train approaches and is blowing off fireballs from an encounter with a robot. the entire train is flaming and burning. the train, as it whisks by is releasing pieces of red hot ash. the bars go up as the train completes it's crossing. the people continue walking.}
