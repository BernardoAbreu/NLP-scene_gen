<T>__{cut them down:}
<A>__{! projectiles are launched, one of which knocks ruffnut off her dragon. she plummets past eret toward the rocky shore below.}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{eret, son of eret!}
<A>__{she suddenly grabbed by both arms before hitting the rocks. ruffnut's pov: of snotlout on one side... and fishlegs on the other. soft and romanticized as her epiphany dawns. above them, more catapults fire, bringing down massive spires of ice, directly over astrid and eret.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{up, girl! to the left, eret! that's it! look out!}
<A>__{it's about to crush them when... it's blown to pieces by toothless' fireball. hiccup, stoick, and gobber come bursting through the flames on their dragons. hiccup and toothless arc across the sky triumphantly and set their sights on a downed dragon surrounded by soldiers. toothless blasts one of drago's net launchers, knocking it onto its side. stoick then chops the trigger line, firing the catapult and netting the throng of soldiers, freeing the dragon. drago's archers target stoick with their arrows.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{take `em down!}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{heads up!}
<A>__{gobber flies up from behind, knocking the archers out with grump's tail. gobber chuckles. drago hears toothless' tell tale banshee scream and turns to see him streaking across the sky.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{dragon master.}
<A>__{hiccup catches up to astrid and eret on stormfly.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{welcome aboard, dragon rider!}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{thanks. i think.}
<A>__{astrid glares, both relieved and annoyed to see hiccup.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{where have you been?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{oh, y'know. catching up with mom.}
<A>__{astrid shoots him a confused glare. he nods skyward. astrid and eret look up to see... valka, in full warrior garb, rising from the towering ice spikes, atop cloudjumper.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{whoa...}
<A>__{an earth trembling roar follows as the bewilderbeast rises behind valka.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{that's your mother?!}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{well, now you know where i get my dramatic flair.}
<A>__{on drago, gawking in awe as the great bewilderbeast blasts an epic explosion of ice upon the attackers.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{the alpha! now we have a fight!}
<A>__{valka blasts overhead on cloudjumper, commanding swarms of dragons to swoop down and attack drago's army. a swarm of zipplebacks set themselves aflame and roll like fiery wagon wheels through the battlefield, scattering soldiers and destroying war machines. one of them gets caught under a dragon swatter, but hiccup and toothless double back for a rescue.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{there! come on, toothless! show them what you got, bud.}
<A>__{toothless dive bombs the swatter and destroys it with a plasma bolt, freeing the dragon.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{thatta boy!}
<A>__{back to valka, on cloudjumper as they pry drago's armored dragons off of the flailing wild ones. a net suddenly envelops cloudjumper. they crash heavily, but valka cuts herself free, sliding to a stop just paces away from drago.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{i've waited a long time for this!}
<A>__{drago cocks his bull hook, ready to strike, but valka deflects drago's hit and attacks him.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{you cannot take our dragons! they are controlled by the alpha!}
<C>__{drago}
<P>__{(smug)}
<D>__{then it's a good thing i brought a challenger.}
<A>__{he turns to the flagship and yells savagely, whirling his bullhook overhead. the heavy chains are released. the underwater creature, now freed, breaks the surface in an epic cascade of seawater. it rises toward the shoreline, revealing itself to be... a second bewilderbeast bigger, meaner, and covered in scars that indicate years of training and abuse. the chains fall away from iron cuffs fastened to its massive tusks. valka gasps.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{another one?}
<C>__{fishlegs}
<D>__{i was way off! that is a class ten! class ten!}
<A>__{drago's challenger lumbers onto the beach, focused on valka's bewilderbeast.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{no. no.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{come on! take down the alpha!}
<A>__{valka attacks drago with her bullhook, trying to stop his commands, but drago strikes back, knocking her forcefully onto her back. he pins her as she struggles, removing her mask and staff. he's about to finish her off, when wham! he's knocked to the ground. he looks up, fuming, to see stoick helping valka to her feet.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{for you, my dear... anything.}
<A>__{as drago gathers his weapon and drops his heavy cloak, circling stoick, drago's bewilderbeast confronts valka's in a threat display.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{val, do you think you can stop them?}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{i will do my best! come on, cloudjumper!}
<A>__{valka cuts the nets away and hops onto cloudjumper, flying off toward the bewilderbeasts as they charge each other,}
<B>__{clashing tusks.}
<A>__{drago lunges at stoick, swiping his bullhook.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{you... i watched you burn!}
<A>__{the two imposing warriors clash weapons, slashing and landing}
<B>__{punches.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{it takes more than a little fire to kill me!}
<A>__{valka flies between the bewilderbeasts, waving her staff commandingly, but to no effect.}
<B>__{back to stoick and drago}
<A>__{as drago hooks and yanks the axe out of stoick's hands. gobber flies by and hurls his mace attachment.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{stoick!}
<A>__{stoick catches it and lands a direct hit on drago. but, with a devastating swipe, drago's bewilderbeast takes down valka's, plunging in its tusks and burying its opponent's lifeless body under an avalanche.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{hiccup and the others watch in horror as dragons everywhere land and bow their heads in acknowledgement of the new alpha drago's alpha.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{we've won.}
<A>__{drago points his bullhook toward valka and cloudjumper.}
<C>__{drago }
<D>__{now finish her!}
<A>__{stoick whirls around, spotting valka and cloudjumper in the alpha's sights.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{drago's bewilderbeast inhales... and blasts! valka steers cloudjumper out of the way, but ice hits his tail, causing them to spiral out of control toward the icy spires.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{hold on!}
<A>__{he leaps onto skullcrusher, spurring him into the air.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{skullcrusher, go! come on, gobber!}
<A>__{stoick tosses the mace back to gobber in passing, who follows brazenly, waving it aloft.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{right behind ya, stoick!}
