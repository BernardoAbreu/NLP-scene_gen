<L>__{interior gerard's office day}
<A>__{the group of deputies and gerard assemble around gerard's information board. they've come armed with facts and theories. gerard orchestrates the information.}
<C>__{renfro}
<D>__{if you were richard kimble... why would you hunt for a one armed man you think killed your wife; find hint then leave him and call us?}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{to throw us off his trail.}
<C>__{renfro}
<D>__{unless... what if you were a well respected surgeon and wanted to kill your wife? how would you do it?}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{i'd hire a pro. sight unseen.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{set it up to look like a robbery gone bad.}
<C>__{renfro}
<D>__{how would you find him? look in the phone book?}
<C>__{renfro}
<D>__{through a connection.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{maybe through a company you did some business with.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{like a pharmaceutical company. someone in security.}
<C>__{newman}
<D>__{on the night of his wife's murder, kimble attended a hospital benefit sponsored by devlin macgregor pharmaceutical sykes' company.}
<A>__{gerard places a devlin macgregor card onto his board.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{but sykes claims he was out of town.}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{and company records support that he was on a business trip.}
<C>__{renfro}
<D>__{that's an easy fix. so let's say he was in town. did the job. everything goes as planned with one problem.}
<C>__{newman}
<D>__{instead of looking like a robbery gone bad, kimble ends up being the one accused...}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{... tried, convicted...}
<C>__{poole}
<D>__{... and the hit man gets away clean.}
<C>__{renfro}
<D>__{so kimble returns to hunt for and find the hit man.}
<C>__{newman}
<D>__{why? to share the blame? he'd still go to prison.}
<A>__{gerard moves to the board. he takes down a card.}
<C>__{renfro}
<D>__{you're underestimating the power of the good doctor. it would be his word against... sykes'. who would you believe?}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{so what does kimble do next?}
<C>__{renfro}
<D>__{get help.}
<A>__{gerard pins the card to the board and looks at renfro. it says: "nichols"}
<C>__{gerard}
<D>__{stevens, check phone records for sykes and kimble.}
