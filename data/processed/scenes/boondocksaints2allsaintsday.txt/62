<L>__{exterior interior "bella sante salon" morning}
<A>__{eunice enters the swanky salon and moves across the lobby.}
<L>__{interior massage room moments later}
<A>__{"gorgeous" george (47yrs) is face down as a female masseuse works his back, incense, mood music. eunice silently slides in flashing her badge, a finger to her pursed lips. uneasy, the woman continues her work as eunice lotions her hands. she covertly replaces the masseuse and motions her out of the room. eunice digs in as the fatted mobster moans with pleasure.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, yeah. someone's been eating their wheaties. yeah, get after it, girl.}
<A>__{eunice grabs a large massage paddle with rubber fingers. she whips george's towel off, winds up and smacks him on his bare ass, hard!!}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{aaaaah!}
<A>__{george involuntarily jerks and rolls off the table.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{what the fuck!?}
<A>__{he bolts to his feet.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{you fucking bitch!}
<A>__{he rounds the massage table, arms outstretched. eunice draws her side arm and sticks it in his face, halting him dead.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{whoa, whoa, whoa.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{what did you just call me?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{why, i'm a lady, george. that fact alone demands a certain amount of...}
<P>__{(cocks hammer back)}
<D>__{...cordiality.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'm, i'm sorry i called you that.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{well, how courteous of you to apologize. courtesy is so important. don't you agree?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{y, yeah...i'm with that.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{good. now sit your fat ass down.}
<A>__{george sits. eunice reholsters, wiggles her skirt straight and sits on the massage table. george looks at her legs as she slowly crosses them. trepidation as he covers his genitals. eunice smiles as she flashes her fbi credentials. george relaxes.}
<C>__{eunice }
<P>__{(with intent)}
<D>__{where is...concezio yakavetta?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{yeah. there's a lot of stuff you don't know, hoss. for instance, why aren't you safely tucked away in some ivory tower with all the other big wigs, sucking on cannoli and shrimp cocktail? why are you the one he left on the streets, george?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{someone's gotta run our legitimate businesses. someone's gotta make sure that...}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{someone's gotta chum the waters.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that's bullshit and i ain't saying another fucking word to you.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{good. then you can just listen. the jig is up. we know concezio had that priest killed.}
<A>__{george snaps his head to eunice in shock, then recovers.}
<C>__{eunice }
<D>__{oh, surprise, surprise. another thing you don't know, i reckon. but why would he tell you? you and your guys on the streets, you're his bait. y'all just got thrown into a meat grinder.}
<A>__{eunice goes to leave but stops and turns back.}
<C>__{eunice }
<D>__{gorgeous george, huh? expendable george is more like it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<C>__{eunice }
<D>__{by the by, you got a pretty nice ass for a fat man.}
