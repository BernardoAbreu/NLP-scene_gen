<L>__{exterior familiar piazza day}
<A>__{the piazza from the fascist e.u.r. building are bustling with office workers laughing, smoking, and hustling. darwin, minerva and kaplan are a solid troika in the center of the steps. the other agents stroll in the periphery....}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{i just don't think it was a smoking hot idea to leave them up there alone.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{don't worry george, this is the reason we put the old diabetic guinea on the payroll to begin with. to keep hawk in line. they'll talk about "being buddies" and "chugging brewskis."}
<C>__{darwin}
<P>__{(raising glass)}
<D>__{you gotta love male bonding.}
<A>__{as darwin slaps kaplan on the back, behind them, hawk and alex come crashing out of the windowed doors of the building.}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{you were saying...}
<A>__{moving to the edge of the stairs, hawk and alex, latter holding his gun, sprout up from their own debris and continue savagely brawling. the wigging out passers by give them space.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you bastard! you fucked my freedom for a lousy job!}
<A>__{alex trembles, going into a diabetic seizure. he shakily raises his gun.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{hawk... i'm so sorry...}
<A>__{hawk roars forward like a bull and helmets alex. they roll together down the massive staircase past darwin, minerva, and the cia who react with "this can't be happening" catatonia. two shots go off as hawk and alex crash to the bottom of the staircase. hawk rises up in a daze to see alex on the ground with two bloody bullet holes.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{no.....alex! wake up, you can't go out like this.}
<A>__{hawk falls to his knees as snickers hustles toward him. suddenly, sirens are heard as a police van pulls up. snickers stops. four policemen blast from the back of the van. one holds back the crowd. one strenuously pulls hawk into the van. the other two drag in alex. the villains look to each other for non existent guidance as the van pulls away.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{plan b, anyone...}
<A>__{using initiative, snickers hops on a vespa and roars off after them. the van can be seen swerving off.....}
<B>__{around a corner}
<A>__{where it bolts up into a much larger truck marked vatican souvenirs. two seemingly innocent bystander priests break demeanor to flop up the wheel ramps, slam close the back of the truck, lock it shut, and continue on their solemn way. the truck bellows off as the vespa spins around the corner. snickers brakes and looks around for the police van. he hits his handle with frustration.}
