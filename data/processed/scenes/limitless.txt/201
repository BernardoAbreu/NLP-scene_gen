<L>__{exterior campaign headquarters building day}
<A>__{eddie and steadman exit, come down the steps, eddie looking thrown. he drifts along, half a step behind steadman, deep in thought.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{it's not so bad, is it?}
<A>__{eddie doesn't answer.}
<C>__{steadman }
<D>__{doesn't every man on the path to greatness have to tolerate the wind drag of compromise?}
<A>__{a black limo waits at the curb.}
<C>__{steadman }
<D>__{overall, we'll all be better off... foreign policy, the courts, even the constitution could stand a little tweaking...}
<A>__{they descend the last few steps. steadman opens the limo door for eddie... but eddie hesitates. doesn't get in.}
<C>__{steadman }
<D>__{eddie?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{after you.}
<C>__{steadman}
<P>__{(cordial)}
<D>__{no, "senator". you first.}
<A>__{eddie gestures for him to get in.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{all right then...}
<A>__{he gets in. and eddie closes the door after him. stands outside the limo, looking back at steadman through the rolled down window, his face a cold mask.}
<C>__{steadman }
<D>__{oh, now. don't underestimate us.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{don't underestimate your own creation.}
<A>__{steadman looks at him quizically.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{i mean, you invented it. what does it do? it puts me 50 steps ahead of you fucks.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{you think i didn't spend my days on mdt devising a personal defense structure that would scare the shit out of the israelis ? you think there's not people with a bead on you right now, right in this building? you think this conversation is private?}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{you don't know the caliber of enemies you'll be making.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you want to push that button? i will show you my silos if you show me yours.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{you'll run out. you'll die.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{or i will think of something. isn't that what mdt does? makes you think of something? might even tell me how to get off it.}
<A>__{a flicker in steadman's eyes. anger.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{what if i just ask the drug... how to tell the drug... how to fuck itself? i mean, isn't it like the 8 ball?}
<A>__{steadman raises his hand to the driver and the limo pulls away.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{it always answers.}
<A>__{as the limo recedes into the distance, eddie finally exhales. and only then do we see it. he's scared.}
<C>__{the end}
