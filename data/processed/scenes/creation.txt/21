<L>__{exterior river bank. the past. day}
<A>__{they have set up their picnic on a river bank. emma is reading. joseph hooker is teaching the boys to fish. he has spectacles and long wispy side whiskers: a battered panama on his head and his trousers rolled up to his knees.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{give it time to take a bite.}
<A>__{the fishing float moves a little}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{he's nibbling. nibbling. oh bother. no one move.}
<A>__{he's dropped his spectacles in the shallows. george (aged 5) feels a jerk on the line. he squeals and drops the rod. the fish takes off upriver. will goes after the dropped rod. on shore, annie runs up with a collecting box to show her father}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i've got one.}
<A>__{she opens the box to show him a little black beetle. the local parson, innes, inclines his head to inspect it}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{what should i feed it?}
<C>__{mr innes}
<D>__{a leaf i should think. what plant did you find him on?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{in the mud under that log.}
<A>__{innes looks to darwin for advice}
<C>__{mr innes}
<D>__{...or a piece of bark maybe.}
<A>__{darwin peers at the insect}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{cycrus caraboides. you can see from the mandibles he's a hunter. he feeds on slugs and snails.}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{annie runs off, calling to the other children}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{etty! willy! find me some slugs. he's hungry!}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{when i said i knew something of insects.....}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{oh tush.... i studied theology for a year but yet i know exceedingly little of the bible.}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{then once i am properly installed at down i shall take pleasure in instructing you.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{i should look forward to that immensely.}
<A>__{emma, knowing her husband's ambivalence towards religion, casts him a slightly arch, amused look. innes notices this, though he pretends not to. hooker returns from the river, looking slightly damp, with the rod which he has managed to retrieve}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{everyone's a bit wet. sorry, but the fish are surely biting. more worms, boys, more worms.}
<A>__{george is looking under stones}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{try over there, georgey, we've used all these ones up.}
<A>__{they move off, joining annie and the other in their hunt for crawling things. the air above them is heavy and sparkling with pollen.}
