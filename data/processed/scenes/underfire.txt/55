<L>__{interior pedro's house day}
<A>__{the three sandinistas, dressed half in khaki, half recycled disco, are pleading with a young man, pedro, 15.}

<D>__{you must come and help us... one more time.}
<C>__{pedro}

<A>__{one of the sandinistas brings pedro his rumpled baseball jersey from another room.}
<D>__{sandinista #2}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{for leon... for nicaragua!}
<A>__{pedro sees price and claire and is more interested in them. he speaks in broken but understandable english.}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{americans? journalists?}
<C>__{claire and price}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{pedro lights up, and runs to a shelf where he returns with a baseball he is signing.}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{ah! i put my autograph on this ball. sandinista #1}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{pedro! there is no time to waste.}
<A>__{pedro is more interested in the two americans.}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{when you get back to the united states, i want you to give this ball to tippy martinez for me. he is from nicaragua.}
<A>__{pedro hands claire the baseball as the sandinistas plead with pedro for his help. he is more interested in getting the baseball delivered to tippy martinez. claire accepts the ball graciously, exchanges awkward glances with price, and puts it in her shoulder bag.}
<D>__{sandinista #1}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{enrique is dead! roberto has disappeared! the guardia has the church, and we need you!}
<C>__{pedro}
<P>__{(to claire and price)}
<D>__{you come, eh?}
<P>__{(to the sandinistas)}
<D>__{can they come with us? sandinista #2 come! everybody come!}
<A>__{they go to the door and open it a crack to look out. p.o.v. the tanquetta passes as soldiers kick open doors across the street. the sandinistas go to a corner of the room and push a book shelf out of the way. a large hole has been broken in the wall. they climb through the hole into the living room of the next house; the woman pushes the shelf back over the hole with great effort.}
