<L>__{interior dashiell's bar}
<A>__{dimly lit. smoky. filled with cloth covered tables and ornamental, african furnishings. a 9 piece jazz band plays swing tunes. a few couples sway on the dance floor. the place is swarming with nazis. many are seated at the bar. others are scattered at various tables throughout the restaurant. some stand in corners. lurking in the shadows. they are all looking in one direction, watching one man...}
<B>__{indiana jones.}
<A>__{indy sits with scraggy, clare and betsy, at a table near the rear of the restaurant. they are eating dinner. but indy, scraggy and clare are more interested in the stone monkey scrolls. a very nervous scraggy translates. indiana, wearing his spectacles, takes pages and pages of notes. searching for a clue. an interested clare reads over indiana's shoulder. betsy tries to become included in the discussion. but everyone ignores her. scraggy continues to translate.}

<D>__{"sun wu kung run like fire, he journey to many monkey land, to build his final empire."}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{who's sun wu kung?}

<P>__{(ignoring betsy, to scraggy)}
<D>__{many monkey land... that's a definite reference to africa.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{africa?... he journeyed to africa?...}
<C>__{clare}
<P>__{(also ignores betsy, to indiana)}
<D>__{that confirms our suspicions that he may have formed his civilization here...}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{what civilization?}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(angry, to betsy)}

<D>__{later.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{what a buncha' stiffs!}
<P>__{(condescending, to clare)}
<D>__{bet you can't dance.}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{quite the contrary...i spent several months studying dance.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{oh yeah? whattayou' know?... the bunny hop?... the jitterbug?...}

<D>__{african tribal dances.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{never heard of 'em.}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{of course not. they're beyond the spectrum of your microscopic world.}
<A>__{insulted, betsy gobbles down her glass of wine and turns back to indiana, who is still deeply concentrating on the scrolls.}
<B>__{under the table}
<A>__{betsy's foot reaches across the floor. it rests on indy's leg. betsy begins to rub against indiana's trouser leg. the red eyed mechanical bug is still attached to indiana's trousers.}
<B>__{indiana}
<A>__{glares at betsy. clare reaches for her cup of coffee. she notices that the coffee cup trembles slightly. clare glances beneath the table, and sees betsy rubbing indy's leg. clare is disgusted. above the table, clare shoots a scowl of disapproval at indy. a flustered indy tries to explain...but is suddenly interrupted by a hand on his shoulder. it is dashiell, the suave, handsome owner of the restaurant. dashiell gives a caarming smile to everyone at the table.}
<C>__{dashiell}
<D>__{enjoying your dinners?...}
<A>__{everyone nods, expressing their thanks. dashiell leans close to indiana and whispers.}
<C>__{dashiell}
<D>__{watch yourself, sport. most of the talk here tonight is about you. and it isn't good.}
<A>__{indiana's eyes dart around the room. he sees the various nazis. watching him. indy gives a confident smile. a worried dashiell continues whispering to indiana.}
<C>__{dashiell}
<D>__{i don't know what you've done to the nazis. but they are certainly no friends of yours.}
