<L>__{interior danny's motel room day}
<A>__{danny is in the bathroom in front of the mirror, holding his shirt up with his chin as he wraps the tallis around his torso. when he lowers the shirt, the fringes hang out like the tsitsis that orthodox men wear. he feels a weird loathing for this, but he smooths and arranges the tsitsis to look just like a hasid's. he clicks his heels together and gives a nazi salute.}

<A>__{another nazi salute. a knock at the door. he hides the fringes under the shirt, throws a blanket over the torah.}
