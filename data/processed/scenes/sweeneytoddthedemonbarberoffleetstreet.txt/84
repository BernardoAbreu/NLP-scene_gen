<A>__{...in mrs. lovett's mind. she and todd sit in the exact same positions as in hampstead heath. only now they are sitting on a beach. they are wearing what she imagines as fashionable seaside bathing clothes. toby, who is not consumptively pale but overly rosy cheeked in her fantasy, is building a sandcastle nearby. mrs. lovett is sitting with her dream todd, of course, so he has a bland smile on his face. somewhat unnatural. in fact, there is something vaguely unreal and stilted about all of this.}
