<T>__{as the radio voice continues:}
<C>__{gabriel heater's voice}
<D>__{there is grave danger everyone agrees to that. the question is what can we do to protect ourselves? what measures can we take that will }
<A>__{during the above, mrs. barley has turned to her husband in sharp annoyance.}
<C>__{mrs. barley}
<D>__{george, i wish you'd turn that radio off. i'm trying to concentrate.}
<A>__{mr. barley reaches out and snaps off the radio.}
<C>__{mr. barley}
<P>__{(snorting, he tosses his paper down)}
<D>__{why doesn't the government do something that's what i want to know.}
<C>__{mr. krull}
<P>__{(mildly)}
<D>__{what can they do? they're only people just like us.}
<C>__{mr. barley}
<D>__{people my foot! they're democrats!}
<C>__{mr. krull}
<D>__{it's enough to give you the shakes. he's got that robot standing there ten foot tall just waiting for orders to destroy us.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{this space man or whatever he is. we automatically assume he's a menace... maybe he isn't at all.}
<C>__{mr. barley}
<P>__{(glaring at her for this silly notion)}
<D>__{then what's he hiding for? why doesn't he come out in the open?}
<C>__{mr. krull}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(indicating the radio)}
<D>__{like the fella says: "what's he up to?"}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{maybe he's afraid.}
<C>__{mrs. barley}
<P>__{(with a derisive snort)}
<D>__{he's afraid!}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{after all, he was shot the moment he landed here.}
<P>__{(she pauses for a moment thoughtfully)}
<D>__{i was just wondering what i would do.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(to helen, helpfully)}
<D>__{perhaps before deciding on a course of action, you'd want to know more about the people here to orient yourself in a strange environment.}
<C>__{mrs. barley}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{there's nothing strange about washington, mr. carpenter.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(quietly, tongue in cheek)}
<D>__{a person from another planet might disagree with you.}
<C>__{mrs. barley}
<D>__{if you want my opinion, he came from right here on earth.}
<P>__{(with significant emphasis)}
<D>__{and you know where i mean.}
<C>__{mr. krull}
<D>__{they wouldn't come in a space ship. they'd come in airplanes.}
<C>__{mrs. barley}
<P>__{(as though with superior knowledge)}
<D>__{i wouldn't be so sure about that.}
<C>__{mr. barley}
<P>__{(delivering the final word)}
<D>__{stands to reason that fella wants some thing or he wouldn't be here.}
<P>__{(facing klaatu)}
<D>__{that make sense, carpenter?}
<A>__{klaatu pauses for a moment, then recites pleasantly.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{i must admit i'm a little confused.}
<A>__{mrs. crockett enters and speaks to helen.}
<C>__{mrs. crockett}
<D>__{mrs. benson mr. stevens is here to see you.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh thank you.}
<A>__{she rises and goes out.}
<C>__{mrs. barley}
<D>__{finish your coffee, george. i told the carsons we'd be there at eleven.}
