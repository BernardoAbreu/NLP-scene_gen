<T>__{cut to bernie:}
<A>__{, looking smug next to david, who is pretty shocked by this.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{he's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{thank you, sir. although, i'm afraid i don't quite see how we can ...}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{good point bernie precisely the kind of perceptive interjection i'd expect from my new v.p. how can we, you ask, survive without whistler's mother our single greatest asset? well, the truth is we can't. so what am i saying? will we find her again? never this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius.}
<A>__{bean looks pleased but then realises it's not a suitable emotion so nods sagely.}
<D>__{insurance? not a chance. those bastards never pay. so, surely we're bankrupt? surely your jobs are forfeit? surely you're back on the unemployment lines, scraping a living as waiters and boys? yes. yes indeed. except for one little thing. one little thing done by one little man. dare i say, one helluva little man. watch this.}
<A>__{everyone is totally at a loss. grierson stands and moves to the framed poster of whistler's mother on the wall. he then produces a plastic key card and inserts it in a slot on the side of the frame. a buzz and a click! an electric motor starts to whirrrr ... the glass, along with the title strip at the bottom of the poster, slides gently down inside the picture frame to reveal that the poster is in fact the original oil of whistler's mother.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen. the real whistler's mother!}
<A>__{there are gasps from the room. bean is open mouthed. grierson beams as many applaud and bean now joins in hyperactively. he's saved!}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{the best security in the world is no match for a master criminal. but no master criminal is a match for me. thank you all. now if you would please return to your posts, my new vice president, bernard shimmel would like you all to see the computer program we had prepared for yesterday until we were so rudely interrupted by events.}
<A>__{the room is emptying. david and bean stand there, david stunned. grierson heads over.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{david, david, david ...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm fired? because i let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{of course not. i'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement. a loss i trust bernie will be able to reverse. david but ....}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{i will of course invite you an excellent reference or bernie will.}
<A>__{bernie looks across from the computer and smiles. bean has his eyes on david. he is mortified by what's happening. grierson notices but misinterprets his worried expression.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{of course, dr. bean, we'll arrange alternative accommodation for you. i believe bernie has a spare room with en suite bathroom.}
<A>__{david glares at bernie. bean is thinking 'no! i don't want to stay with horrible bernie.'}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{how are you making out there?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{all fixed up, sir. stick around, davey boy. this is going to be quite a show.}
<A>__{he presses an intercom. he's enjoying himself.}
<D>__{hi everyone this is your new vice president, bernie shistler. would you please watch your video screens. you're in for a treat, guys.}
