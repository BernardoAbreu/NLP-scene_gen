<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{rocky exits the trolley and walks down the block... he waves at a pair of high heeled hookers and they wave back. rocky passes a sleeping wino curled in front of a dirty bookstore. rocky drags the man into a protective passageway. further down the street, rocky pauses in front of the "animal town pet shop"... he peers into the dark store and sees a sad, huge dog sitting in the window. he mumbles to the dog and continues to the corner.}
