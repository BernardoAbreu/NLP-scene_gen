<L>__{131. exterior the palace road morning}
<A>__{dust swirls as the british cavalry moves off with their highland pipers at the head playing a military bagpipe tune. capt. blum burtt comes out of the palace and gets into an open car. blumburtt's car moves off behind the cavalry and then the supply trucks follow.}
<L>__{132. interior willie's suite}
<A>__{the whine of the bagpipes is eerily muted in the dark room. through the gently swaying mosquito netting, we see willie asleep on the bed. then through her side of the gauzy netting, we see the door opening across the room. indiana enters quietly and moves toward the bed, his eyes fixed on willie's sleeping body. indy sits down on the bed slowly. willie turns in her sleep and opens her eyes. through the mosquito netting she sees indy sit ting with his back to her.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{indy? did you walk to them?}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{so now they believe me.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{yes, they believe you.}
<A>__{indiana speaks in a strange monotone.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{then they'll send the soldiers down into the temple...}
<A>__{willie looks at indiana's back and continues quietly.}
<C>__{willie }
<D>__{i was scared to death last night when i thought they were going to kill you.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{no... they won't kill me.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(smiling faintly)}
<D>__{you know you've been nothing but trouble since i hooked up with you but i have to admit i'd miss you if i lost you...}
<A>__{now indiana starts to turn slowly.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{you won't lose me, willie...}
<A>__{she sees him turn and his face slowly comes toward the mosquito netting his face pushes into the netting and willie looks stunned as indy's mouth opens he starts hissing grotesquely, smoke billows out of his mouth and the mosquito netting burns open to expose his terrifying face moving toward willie she is forzen with fear and unable to utter a sound as indy's malevolent face looms at her and then she notices his eyes his eyes glowing a hellish luminscent yellow! willie screams!! she suddenly bolts from the bed and tries to run indiana goes into a rage, ripping the mosquito netting from the bed as he fol lows her.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{no! i've found it you can't kali knows!}
<A>__{willie tries the door but it's locked. she sees indiana moving toward her ranting incoherently as he smashes a vase out of his way }
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{ been too many lies there's no god's heaven just the horror! i've seen it life preying on life!}
<A>__{willie cowers in a corner, horrified by the transformation she sees in indiana. shouting and pacing indy holds his head against the pain of his terrible thoughts }
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{ rivers destroying mountains a comet in space exploding!}
<P>__{(holding his head)}
<D>__{aaahh! the screams pitiful people their pain the hate and greed always greed!}
<A>__{the light throws his shadow over willie a giant shadow float ing back and forth over her as she cries in the corner, unable to fight the evil devouring indiana.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{ but i've found kali's touch! death no more lies the death i've been searching for!}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{quit crying! she can hear you kali knows fear don't you under stand kali is freedom!}
<A>__{indiana stops pacing and willie freezes in terror. now a bizarre yellow light wipes across the room. indiana turns and watches silently as two thuggee guards emerge from a secret doorway that's opened the shadows of the thuggee guards loom over willie and she screams again!}
