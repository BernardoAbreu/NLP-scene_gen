<L>__{exterior second floor porch, the duplex house night}
<A>__{mumford comes out to the rail and looks off over the town of mumford. what he sees (or imagines he sees): all across the nightscape, one window in every house is glowing blue with flickering tv light.}
<L>__{exterior cook house night}
<A>__{moving in on the porch steps. mumford runs into the shot. in fact, he's run the whole way from his place and he's out of breath. he takes the porch steps three at a time, rings the doorbell, and waits. mrs. cook peeks out, then opens the front door, an especially sour look on her face. she speaks through the screen door.}
<C>__{mrs. cook}
<D>__{well, look who's here...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{good evening, mrs. cook.}
<C>__{mrs. cook}
<D>__{just who is here, can you tell me?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{could i see sofie, please?}
<C>__{mrs. cook}
<D>__{no, you can not. i wouldn't know who to say is calling.}
<C>__{sofie }
<D>__{mother...}
<A>__{mrs. cook glances inside at the as yet unseen sofie, then hisses at mumford }
<C>__{mrs. cook}
<D>__{i could see right through you from the start, you imposter. i know what you're after. i knew it then and i know it now!}
<A>__{sofie appears behind her mother.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{mother...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what do you think i'm after, mrs. cook?}
<C>__{mrs. cook}
<D>__{sofie. it's so obvious... you're after my daughter.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{well, i gotta say, mrs. cook, you're right about that.}
<A>__{both sofie and mrs. cook are set back for a moment. mrs. cook recovers fastest }
<C>__{mrs. cook}
<D>__{it'll never happen! you're in big trouble, mister.}
<C>__{sofie}
<P>__{(scary strong)}
<D>__{mother... go away!}
<A>__{mr. cook suddenly appears, takes mrs. cook by the arm and makes her vanish. sofie and mumford are left alone. she looks at him through the screen.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i guess you saw the show...?}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{which show was that?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{sofie...}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{part of it. we were watching "er" until someone called.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you probably got the idea.}
<A>__{sofie comes outside. she doesn't get too close or look at him as she walks to the other end of the porch.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{do you know what a betrayal this is?...}
<A>__{mumford knows.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{...how violated i feel?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you're not the only one...}
<A>__{sofie turns sharply to look at him, ready to blow up.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{you feel violated?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{not me... all my other my patients. i smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{you deserve it.}
<A>__{mumford agrees. he watches her closely.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{i should be irate.}
<A>__{mumford immediately perks up. sofie tries to correct }
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{i am irate!}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{(grabbing at the thread)}
<D>__{but...}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{but nothing... i'm mad as hell. this is a terrible thing you've done.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i know it! please believe me, i know that...}
<A>__{mumford steps closer to her.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{but, there is one... mitigating factor i want you to consider before you write me off.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{will you think about it?}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{i don't know. depends. i'm in a bad mood.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i love you. more than i've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.}
<A>__{she looks into his eyes.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i want to spend the rest of my life with you... but i'm not sure you feel the same way.}
<A>__{she regards him for several moments, her mind racing.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{i sort of do...}
<A>__{mumford feels joy. now, finally, he takes her in his arms.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{...but first, you have to tell me something...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{anything... just ask.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{what is your name?}
<A>__{as mumford breaks into a huge grin, cut to:}
