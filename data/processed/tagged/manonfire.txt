<B>__{opening title sequence}
<L>__{exterior mexico city day}
<A>__{high over the city on a bright sunday morning, the sun pounding its way through the orange haze of smog. as we descend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets: the sounds of a mass being sung.}
<B>__{a catholic church}
<A>__{the big wooden doors open to release the parishioners inside. feature a tall, lanky 18 year old. holding his girlfriend's hand, anxious for sunday to really begin. they don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a faucet's been cranked down. they move toward a mercedes}
<L>__{500. as a chauffeur holds the back door open for them...}
<B>__{a grand marquis}
<A>__{squeals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside the mercedes. four men get out flashing badges. in a moment they're hustling eighteen toward the car, stiff arming the chauffeur. as the girlfriend cries and the gossip among the parishioners begins... the grand marquis pulls away.}
<L>__{interior grand marquis day}
<A>__{they shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat. these guys are not the police. a switchblade is flicked open. practiced hands slit the boy's sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels. eighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf. duct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head.}
<L>__{exterior wooded area day}
<A>__{the marquis is parked across from another car. four new guys wait as eighteen is hauled out of the marquis. his clothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin. he stands naked, bound and blind. eighteen is handed over from one group to the other.}
<L>__{interior telephone upscale home mexico city day}
<A>__{the phone rings. a bomb going off. eighteen's distraught father (family photos of the boy on the wall) answers. reverse to reveal a battery of police and negotiators in the room with him. one of them listens in, waves fingers at him as the negotiations begin.}
<L>__{interior video surveillance of an 8' x 4' cell day}
<A>__{a wall smeared with god knows what. facing it, eighteen stands naked blindfolded and shivering. the back of his leg still bleeds. he shifts nervously as a little jack russell terrier eagerly licks the blood off his calf. a man ('the dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates by cell phone. voice calm. as he runs numbers, he slaps his thigh. jack russell trots over, gets an ear scratched. at a motion from the man, eighteen is taken down to the ground. straddled by two men, his head is mummified in tape leaving one ear exposed.}

<L>__{exterior upscale house day}
<A>__{as a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox. a glimpse of something we don't want to see. an ear partially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear.}
<L>__{exterior city square mexico city night}
<A>__{a mercedes driving around the square, eighteen's father waving a white shirt out the window like a surrender flag.}
<L>__{exterior bridge night (3 am)}
<A>__{footbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway. empty train blazes through. dangerous, deserted downtown neighborhood. looks more like "war torn beirut", burnt out cars and trash. the 18 year old's father, naked to the waist, walks from the family mercedes over the footbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi derelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of fabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open. he slams the pillow case in the trunk and leaves.}
<L>__{exterior downtown mexico city twilight}
<A>__{rush hour. a red stream of headlights separated from a white stream of taillights by a narrow median. horns blare as a car stops. eighteen, still blindfolded, is dumped on the median. the car pulls away. he stands there in the whirlwind. pathetically screaming for help. more horns, shouts, no help. end main titles. goes to black.}

<A>__{samuel valencia ramos and his lawyer jordan kalfus in the privacy of an alcove table. jordan is well heeled, well connected and well oiled. in that order. samuel, at 40, already has the patrician look that has served the male members of his family for generations. they discuss the kidnapping, a headline on the paper jordan tosses aside.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{the family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.}
<P>__{(laughs; chews)}
<D>__{his father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{and now every mother with money in mexico city wants bigger and better bodyguards. my own wife included.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{if she pisses you off, you get another one.}
<C>__{samuel}
<P>__{(laughs grimly)}
<D>__{do you know what she told me last night?}
<T>__{flash to:}
<L>__{interior sitting room ramos villa mexico city night}
<A>__{samuel sits at his baby grand piano playing a gentle rendering of 'delibes'. his american wife lisa stands away from him. just the sight of her back reveals a pitch perfect petulance. she tells him:}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{a man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. only the amount matters.}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{and bankruptcy. where will that put me in the social strata?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i'm only asking for one thing. and it's not an extravagance. it's not even for me; it's for our daughter.}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{our daughter.}
<A>__{she turns at that: a woman so beautiful it nearly hurts to look at her. she stares, plays him like chinese checkers.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{our child's safety is at stake.}
<C>__{samuel}
<P>__{(stops playing)}
<D>__{these people are professionals. they don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. a bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. now he's gone, i feel totally exposed.}
<A>__{she just stares at him. he melts.}
<T>__{return to:}
<L>__{interior ago's mexico city day}

<D>__{yeah? and if she was ugly?}
<A>__{samuel rolls his eyes. jordan laughs. beheading two cigars, he passes one to samuel.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{all my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{i have a policy, aig. it covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, i will not be able to renew it.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i know you need to please lisa. an ass like that is hard to find. good bodyguards are even harder.}
<C>__{samuel}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{i know! i just had to let one go because i couldn't afford him!}
<A>__{jordan lights his cigar.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you need a bodyguard of some description. it's a dangerous world we live in. but you will get what you pay for. he doesn't need to be superman, does he? can you go fifteen grand?}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{for a year?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{for a few months. hire someone cheap. you have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. then fire him for incompetence. the important thing is lisa's daughter will return to school.}
<A>__{samuel finally follows the logic.}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{and lisa will be able to save face. we won't be the only family without a bodyguard.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{her beauty fucks with your mind.}
<C>__{samuel}

<L>__{exterior corridor mexico city airport day}
<A>__{as a 747 is towed by in the background, a man strides at us. creasy. even in movement, he has a stillness, an air of isolation. he's set apart from other living things. he wears dark sunglasses, carries a well worn leather bag. inscrutable. disconnected. a bit frightening. the discipline of a soldier. the independence of a gunslinger. automatic baggage teller (red light, green light). creasy feeds the machine with his perforated customs card. light flashes red.}

<A>__{he flips through creasy's passport. even the stamps have stamps. thailand. somalia. cuba. columbia. hong kong. saudi arabia. every country in europe. guy's been around. customs looks up from the ink blue american eagle to the deep matte black of creasy's sunglasses. note: italics denotes the lines spoken in spanish.}

<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i have a friend there.}
<A>__{customs looks at creasy a moment. he doesn't look like a man who has 'friends'. finally, customs smiles.}
<C>__{customs}
<D>__{i cannot see your eyes, senor.}
<A>__{creasy slips off the sunglasses. his eyes are deserted. inevitable. customs can only look into them a moment. he indicates for creasy to put his bags on a conveyor belt leading to an x ray machine. creasy lifts his bag onto the conveyor. the official hits the start button. the bag drives forward towards the x ray machine. creasy pauses, then offers up a license from his wallet.}
<C>__{customs}
<D>__{senor?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{it's a permit to carry a gun in columbia. the gun you're about to find in that suitcase.}
