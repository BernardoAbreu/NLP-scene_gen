<L>__{exterior beach club, lake michigan sunset}
<A>__{julianne in t shirt and shorts, rushes onto the deck of a sprawling beach club. clutching her bag, she quickly surveys the scene... ... the entire beach has been taken over by the wedding party. young folks, old folks, little kids, maybe 200 people. we scan with her to find a crowd around... ... a three on three volleyball game. kimmy and two groomsmen on one side, facing michael and the tennessee debs. the twins wear spectacular bikinis and are surprisingly athletic, as well as predictably uninhabited. as the next point begins, kimmy serves... ... sammy in back makes a nice dig, lobbing to mandy who sets for michael's vicious spike straight through his best man's hapless defense. the crowd cheers michael, and as he turns, mandy gives him a savage... ... chest bump of congratulation, that any nfl linebacker would be proud of. it puts the surprised michael straight on his butt. laughter, applause. the twins pull him up and sammy gives him a hot kiss on his ear that makes the crowd react. kim plays good sport. julianne watches michael's body for a beat, then... ... dashes off. down the beach, several barbecue grills have been set up. manned by beach club staff and family alike. michael's pop, joe, is dispensing beers from a keg. kim's mom, isabelle, is coordinating the beans, potato salad and corn on the cob table. julianne races across the sand to... ... a huge smoky grill where walter is basting baby back ribs, clearly enjoying himself. julianne runs up to him, says something into his ear. he looks at her. then turns his station over to a club steward, and follows julianne down toward the lakeside. close now. as they stroll together, she's a little breathless. he's watching her profile, curious, silent. at the water's edge...}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{is anybody watching?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i hope so. this is all too mysterious to waste on just me.}
<A>__{she reaches into her big bag. pulls out a single folded sheet of paper.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i picked up michael's messages for him, at our hotel. i stole one...}
<A>__{his face darkens. the easy smile fades. he holds up his palms...}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{julianne, reading my son in law's mail, is not something...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{sir, this is important! haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?}
<A>__{his smile returns. just a little.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{matter of fact, that's how i got married.}
<A>__{the look holds. she thrusts the paper out. he still doesn't take it.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{it's a fax from sports illustrated from ben isaacson, michael's boss.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{i know ben.}
<A>__{she opens the paper.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{"mike. we still have no answer to our e mail of wednesday. which option do you select? i don't mean to rush you, but personnel needs to tie up the loose ends."}
<A>__{he takes the paper. we see it now. looks authentic.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i think he's been fired.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{it doesn't say th...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{he's said some things over the past few weeks. look, this is why i came up with the idea of you offering him a job.}
<A>__{he looks up. he's listening. closely.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{and why i couldn't say anything before in front of kim.}
<A>__{she bites her lip. seems so earnest.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i just think of how... desperate he must be feeling. he's marrying a rich man's daughter, and he's about to become destitute. you know the kind of job market he'll be facing?}
<A>__{he does.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{and you think he's kept this to himself.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{he's too proud to beg for help. and if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. completely humiliating.}
<A>__{he's staring at her. but his mind is working behind his eyes.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{if you do it now, it's like he's helping you. he can accept with dignity.}
<A>__{he taps the paper with the back of his knuckles.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{this fax could mean... any number of things...}
<A>__{she nods. she knows that.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{maybe. i should call ben.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{then it could all come out, sooner or later. nobody should be in on this. just you and me. or, more correctly, i.}
<A>__{she takes the paper back.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{what if, what if i could find that e mail?}
<A>__{the long straight look. maybe he's hooked.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i never noticed. kimmy has your eyes.}
