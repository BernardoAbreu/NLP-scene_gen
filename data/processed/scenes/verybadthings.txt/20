<T>__{series of shots:}
<A>__{tina dances, slowly peeling off her clothes. the guys are into it. michael seems especially turned on. tina moves in on fisher, starts a very nasty lap dance... somehow incorporating a rubber hose. the guys hoop and holler... michael is mesmerized... tina grinds on fisher's lap, touching her nipples... michael's going crazy... he tries to touch her, she slaps his hand away... fisher can't take it anymore... tina relents... moves on... michael reaches for her leg like a dog in heat. she passes over him, teasing, tormenting him, and settles onto adam's lap. the guys roar in approval... michael glowers... adam turns bright red as tina arouses and rides him... michael starts to burn... the guys egg tina on, she gets off on adam's shyness, rubs her breasts in his face... the guys are howling... tina sucks one of adam's fingers into her mouth... michael looks like he's going to explode... adam's overwhelmed, he politely bails out...}

<A>__{boyd reaches for the bottle as the beat goes on. hotel suit montage distorted, a bit crooked. music and dialogue constantly changing levels. we're not sure who's saying what. we're not sure of physical geography. the one thing we are sure of is that michael is fucking the hell out of tina in the bathroom.}
