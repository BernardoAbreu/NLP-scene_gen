<ACTION>__{A close-shot of a yellow legal tablet.  A young hand comes into frame, holding a pencil.  For a few moments, we hear only the soft scratching of pencil on paper, as credits are written in a series of dissolves.  The hand carefully erases and corrects an error or two along the way.  And then the sound of an old friend... the warm crackle of a vinyl record... as we now hear Alvin and the Chipmunks' "Christmas Song."}

<ACTION>__{Santa Claus wears shorts and sandals, ringing a bell as he collects for the Salvation Army.  This is Christmas in the Southland.  No snow, no winter wonderland.  Just a pleasantly thick heat and an unchanging season, as music continues. Turning the corner, walking into frame is ELAINE MILLER, 35. She is a tall woman, consumed by the fevered conversation she's Having with her pale young son WILLIAM, late pre-teens.  They stand apart from the other shoppers.  All around them is the highly-charged salesmanship of the season... silver glittering fake Christmas trees.  She hurries her son through the commercial juggernaut, continuing their lively intellectual conversation, when something stops her.  A Workman is affixing letters to a store-front.  He has already placed the MERRY... now he's finishing the XMAS.  Elaine is strong, but always pleasant, always clear about her purpose in this life.}
