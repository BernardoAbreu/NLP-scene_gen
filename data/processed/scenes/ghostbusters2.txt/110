<L>__{interior venkman's loft day (later)}
<A>__{there's a knock at the front door, a key turns in the lock, and venkman enters somewhat tentatively holding a bouquet of flowers and a small suitcase of dana's.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{i'm home!}
<A>__{he looks around the large open loft.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{i knew it. she cleaned.}
<A>__{he hears the shower running and crosses to the bathroom. the door is half open and he can see dana in the shower (tastefully blurred) through the transparent vinyl curtain. he closes the bathroom door and looks at the baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling off. then he turns and bumps into dana who's just coming out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel. she jumps back into the bathroom. she comes out again, this time wearing a robe.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{are you all squeaky clean now?}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(humoring him)}
<D>__{yes, i'm very clean. did they find anything at my apartment?}
<A>__{she squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(through the door)}
<D>__{nothing. they stayed there all night, went through your personal stuff, made a bunch of long distance phone calls and cleaned out your refrigerator. and didn't find anything.}
<A>__{dana opens the bedroom door.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{they didn't find anything? in the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing? so, what do i do now?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{now you get dressed and we go out. i got a babysitter and everything. trust me, you need it.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{i'm not here to date. i can't leave oscar in a strange place with someone i don't know.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{it's janine melnitz, from my staff. she's one of my most valuable employees.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{does she know anything about babies?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{janine melnitz, are you kidding?}
<P>__{(handing her the flowers)}
<D>__{do i have a vase? i brought some of your clothes. wear something intriguing. i brought along some interesting possibilities.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{okay, but it's not a date. it's a dinner.}
<A>__{she smiles and closes the door again. he opens the closet and starts looking for his good suit.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?}
<C>__{dana }
<D>__{i put them in your hamper. i thought they were dirty.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{i have a hamper? next time ask me first, okay. i have more than two grades of laundry. there're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.}
<A>__{he pulls some clothes out of the hamper and inspects them.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{these aren't so bad yet. you just hang them up for a while and they're fine.}
