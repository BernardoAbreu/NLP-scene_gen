<L>__{ext frankenstein estate day}
<A>__{the once magnificent estate lies in smoldering ruin beneath a merciless gray sky. charred beams and drifting smoke are all that remain to mark the passing of a noble family. victor stands gazing at the house. a windswept, hollow man bundled in a rough coat. flintlock rifle dangling at his side. henry moves into frame some distance behind. softly:}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{victor.}
<A>__{no reaction. for a long moment it seems victor hasn't heard. he rouses as if from a trance, turn and walks to his pack horse. the animal stands saddled and ready. he starts to mount up, but henry intercepts him with a restraining hand. victor snaps a look as if seeing a stranger... and then his features soften.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{all that i once loved lies in a shallow grave. by my hand.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{let it go.}
<A>__{victor pauses, emotions swirling. wishing he could grab the dangling thread of sanity henry has offered... but knowing the thread is a bittersweet illusion. a bare whisper:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you should have been my father's son. he would have been so proud.}
<A>__{victor abruptly heaves himself into the saddle and spurs his horse. henry runs after him, shouting:}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{victor! come back!}
<A>__{but victor keeps riding without so much as a backward glance. the past is dead. henry watches victor until he's gone from sight, as willie did so long ago...}
