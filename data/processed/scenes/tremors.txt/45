<L>__{exterior desert concrete ditch day}
<A>__{val and earl are riding at full gallop. they race alongside a concrete lined flood control ditch and veer off to follow a barbed wire fence which crosses the ditch.}
<L>__{exterior desert barbed wire fence day}
<A>__{they ride along the fence during:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{here's the plan...we don't even stop. ride like hell. tonight we keep right on going. we'll walk the horses.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{that is the plan...i mean, goddamn it! what the hell are those things? how could they bury an entire plymouth station wagon?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{why would they do it?}
<A>__{suddenly the horses stop short. in a frenzy they wheel around, rear up, refusing to go on. the cowboys fight to control them.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{i knew it! pham van wouldn't know a decent horse if...!}
<A>__{but earl's already drawing his rifle.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{shut up! they got wind of something they don't like!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{oh shit!}
<A>__{he draws his rifle. they look wildly in all directions at once but there's nothing, only empty desert.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{but i don't see anything!}
<A>__{they keep staring. the horses keep pacing nervously. then earl's horse rears wildly and falls! earl goes flying. val wheels around wildly, dismounts and runs to earl, who's bruised and winded but basically unhurt. they think earl's horse just tripped.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{hey, you okay? you okay?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{yeah...yeah.}
<P>__{(turning to the horse)}
<D>__{what about the hor...?}
<A>__{their eyes bulge. several "snake things" have engulfed the horse's head, sucking, crushing, slurping. val's horse goes berserk and gallops for the horizon.}
<C>__{earl }
<D>__{what in the name...?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{that's how they get you! they're under the goddamn ground !}
<A>__{suddenly they realize what that means the thing could come up under them !! the cowboys scramble frantically away. but nothing pursues them. they pause, glancing back nervously.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{what the hell are they?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{sons of bitches!}
<A>__{val raises his rifle and takes a well aimed shot, hitting one of them. orange goo spurts out. we hear a deafening shriek as all the "snake things" instantly zip back underground. then a huge mound of earth rises up under val and earl!! the cowboys tumble down its side, val losing his rifle. they roll over and stare dumbfounded at the mound.}
<C>__{val }
<P>__{(gasps)}
<D>__{there must be a million of them!!}
<A>__{the mound of earth turns toward them. the ground splits open and out rises a huge head!}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(awestruck)}
<D>__{nope...just one.}
<A>__{the monster is a horrendous thirty foot long eating machine! its head is eyeless, utterly alien, covered with tough boney plates which close together to form a cork screw pointerior the cowboys stumble back toward the fence in speechless terror. the creature slides toward them, pushing through the earth like a whale through water. now it opens its mouth but it's like a grotesque flower, boney plates spreading open like petals, revealing a huge, slimy, fleshy, oozing orifice! and inside the mouth, a ghastly multi tentacled tongue! these are the "snake things," not snakes at all but actually the horrid hook tentacles that can shoot out six feet to snag their prey! the monster snorts and snuffs, throwing up plumes of dust, sounding like a horrendous pig. it sinks into the earth and charges! we see the hump of earth move toward them faster and faster but then it disappears as the creature goes deeper. val and earl leap sideways and run along the fence. the creature goes straight and slams into a fencepost from below. all we see is the fencepost knocked at a crazy angle. the cowboys keep running. the creature regroups and charges after them, hitting each fencepost in turn, sending weird sinuous shock waves along the barbed wire, making almost musical twanging sounds. val looks back.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{it's gaining on us!!}
<A>__{and as if that weren't enough, earl points to more trouble ahead.}
