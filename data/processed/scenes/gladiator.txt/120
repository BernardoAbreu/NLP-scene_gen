<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{as it was at the beginning so is it now. the great she wolf of rome will again suckle us, again ravage our enemies and bring us a world reborn!}
<A>__{at his cue, two elevator platforms rumble into view, rising from the bowels of the colosseum to the arena sand. on each platform is a cage full of ferocious wolves, they snap and growl, straining to be released.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{so it was for romulus and remus, sons of mars, so shall it be for us! the great she wolf will }
<A>__{suddenly the huge wooden doors of the arena burst open and maximus leads the felix regiment cavalry thundering into the arena. the crowd is stunned commodus is stunned lucilla bolts up commodus immediately spins to lucilla, his eyes burning his praetorian are momentarily confused at gallus' command the felix regiment archers let fly multiple arrows and bolts cut through most of the praetorians some confusing skirmishes as the remaining praetorians fire back maximus leaps from his horse and begins cutting the prisoners free meanwhile, commodus strides back down the platform toward lucilla in the imperial box, murder in his eyes she suddenly hugs lucius quickly and kisses him }
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{remember your mother.}
<A>__{she pulls the ceremonial dagger from his little uniform and pushes him to his attendant his attendant pulls him away as lucilla spins to commodus he grabs her into an embrace he turns the knife on her thrusting deeply as he kisses her a long kiss as he holds her tightly to him. then he gently sits her down on her throne. her eyes wide, dying. one of commodus' body guards grabs him:}

<D>__{this way, caesar!}
<A>__{below, through the confusion, maximus sees commodus escaping with lucius down through a side tunnel. maximus cuts juba and proximo free. juba immediately snatches up a sword. maximus quickly offers a sword to proximo.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{captain?}
