<L>__{interior first national bank office day}
<A>__{curtis blows into a styrofoam cup and stares through the blinds of an office window. outside, a flag snaps at the top of a pole next to the first national bank sign. he looks down at a newspaper laid out on an end table next to him. he flips it over and studies the ads on the back. a big one in the corner catches his eye. it reads, "cuyahoga gun and knife show!" the ad lists items for sell trade: ...tactical gear, gas masks, batons... curtis focuses in on the words "gas masks" and tears the ad out. john myers(34) enters with a set of papers in his hand. curtis quickly tucks the ad into his back pocket. myers takes a seat in one of two chairs in front of his desk and looks over the papers. he takes a pen out of his pocket as curtis sits down next to him.}
<C>__{myers}
<D>__{well you've kept up with the payments on the house.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{we've been good about that.}
<A>__{myers nods, but he carries a look of concern. he confides.}
<C>__{myers}
<D>__{i gotta tell you curtis, banks aren't loaning money the way they used to. we've got you a loan today, but the interest rates are variable and we have to tie it to your house.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{that's fine.}
<A>__{myers sits back, drawing the pen to his lips and tapping it.}
<C>__{myers}
<D>__{curtis, i've known you a long time. we financed your house for you, two vehicles. i'm telling you this is a risky loan you're taking.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i need the money john.}
<A>__{myers nods, then leans forward and clicks the pen.}
<C>__{myers}
<D>__{okay.}
