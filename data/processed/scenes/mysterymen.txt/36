<L>__{interior the diner night}
<A>__{our heroes sit at their usual table along with invisible boy and a weird looking guy in a greasy, stained yellow superhero outfit. across his chest in falling off stick on letters it reads "the spleen", and that's exactly who he is. furious, the raja, and shoveler sit as far away from him as possible. he is a totally noxious, hyperactive person... and he is thrilled to be there.}
<C>__{spleen}
<D>__{boy i can't tell you how thrilled i was when you guys called you gonna eat that pickle?}
<P>__{(sucks it in)}
<D>__{i've always dreamed of being a member of the a real superhero team and to have friends real friends i mean guys i could live with sleep with die with eat with...}
<A>__{he puts the mustard dispenser to his lips and squeezes it straight into his mouth.}
<C>__{spleen}
<D>__{i love mustard.}
<A>__{furious, raja, and the shoveler react; they can't believe they've actually invited this guy to join their group.}
<C>__{invisible boy}
<D>__{so what exactly is your superpower?}
<C>__{spleen}
<D>__{well, when i was a kid i grew up on love canal remember that? and my brothers and i used to go swimming in it make kool aid out of it stuff like that. anyway my brothers all died, but i lived, and i grew all these like weird organs that have never been seen in humans before. so now i can do things like this!}
<A>__{he leans over the table and lets just a little tiny drop of spittle dribble onto the table... close on the table as the spittle burns a hole in the formica.}
<C>__{spleen}
<D>__{cool, huh?}
<A>__{the spleen inadvertently gives the tiniest little burp, and our three heroes duck out of the way or under the table.}
<D>__{furious, raja, & shoveler watch it!... look out!... whoa!}
<A>__{the people in the next booth give a cry of revulsion, put their hands to their mouths, and immediately leave.}
<C>__{spleen}
<D>__{sorry, sorry.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{hey, why don't you just put a cork in it?}
<C>__{spleen}
<D>__{i tried that once. the cork melted.}
<A>__{the same after dinner our heroes mull their situation over coffee. monica freshens their cups. the spleen squirts mustard in his coffee.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{there's just not enough of us.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{but we know they're out there. hundreds maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{and a social life.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{yeah, but how do we get to them?}
<C>__{spleen}
<D>__{obscene phone calls?}
<A>__{they ignore that suggestion.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{why don't you throw a barbecue?}
<P>__{(moves off to another table)}
<A>__{on our heroes, realizing that's it.}
