<A>__{fire. everywhere. no sign of life. a large gaping doorway, flames ringing it, blazing into the room beyond. hanging by one hinge there, its metal blasted and jagged, is a heavy door with the signed lettering, in german, "danger munitions". the first explosion happens. it's a baby compared to what's coming yet it rocks the earth. it's terrible. and then, almost immediately, another. the long, irregular, ever larger chain of explosions begins.}
