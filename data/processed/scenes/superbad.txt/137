<L>__{interior jules' bedroom continuous}
<A>__{evan practically holds helen up, almost dropping her several times, as they stumble into jules' bedroom. helen puts down the tequila and starts kissing evan, but it's not nice kissing, it's sloppy porno kissing with way too much tongue. after a few moments evan pulls away and looks at the remarkably drunk helen.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i so flirt with you in math.}

<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i know. i've wanted to get with you so hard.}
<A>__{helen kisses him.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{like...so hard.}
<A>__{helen yanks him onto the bed and starts sloppily kissing him again. evan doesn't know what to do. she tries to take off evan's shirt, but is way too inebriated to undo the buttons. evan yanks it off.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{good...}
<A>__{helen stands up and starts to waver back and forth. she looks like she's about to tip over, but she catches herself and sloppily tries to strike a sexy pose like a model. evan watches in dread as she starts to strip, pulling her shirt over her head, completely failing to look sexual. as evan watches the tragedy unfold, he grabs the bottle of tequila and takes a big swig. helen sits on the floor and concentrates on untying her shoes.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{what the fuck...stupid shoe...}
<A>__{evan moves over to help her. he can't do it either.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{shit. can you, like, slip out?}
<A>__{helen tries to squeeze her feet out, but she can't. she grabs a pair of scissors off a desk.}
<C>__{evan }
<D>__{whoa. fuckin'...careful.}
<A>__{she snips off the knot and slips her shoe off.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you...take off your pants...}
<P>__{(drunkenly waving the scissors)}
<D>__{or i will cut `em off.}
<A>__{helen laughs as she staggers to her feet and start kissing evan. he starts taking off his pants.}
