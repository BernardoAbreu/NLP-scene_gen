<L>__{interior stern's apartment day}
<A>__{settled into an overstuffed chair in a simple apartment, schindler pours a shot of cognac from a flask.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{there's a company you did the books for on lipowa street, made what, pots and pans?}
<A>__{stern stares at the cognac schindler's offering him. he doesn't know who this man is, or what he wants.}
<C>__{stern}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{by law, i have to tell you, sir, i'm a jew.}
<A>__{schindler looks puzzled, then shrugs, dismissing it.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{all right, you've done it good company, you think?}
<A>__{he keeps holding out the drink. stern declines it with a slow shake of his head.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{it did all right.}
<A>__{schindler nods, takes out a cigarette case.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i don't know anything about enamelware, do you?}
<A>__{he offers stern a cigarette. stern declines again.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{i was just the accountant.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think? change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?}
<A>__{schindler lowers his voice as if there could possibly be someone else listening in somewhere.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{field kits, mess kits...}
<A>__{he waits for a reaction, and misinterprets stern's silence for a lack of understanding.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{army contracts.}
<A>__{but stern does understand. he understands too well. schindler grins good naturedly.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. don't you think?}
<C>__{stern}
<P>__{(with an edge)}
<D>__{i think most people right now have other priorities.}
<A>__{schindler tries for a moment to imagine what they could possibly be. he can't.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{like what?}
<A>__{stern smiles despite himself. the man's manner is so simple, so in contrast to his own and the complexities of being a jew in occupied cracow in 1939. he really doesn't know. stern decides to end the conversation.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{get the contracts and i'm sure you'll do very well. in fact the worse things get the better you'll do. it was a "pleasure."}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{the contracts? that's the easy part. finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.}
<A>__{he laughs loudly, uproariously. but then, just as abruptly as the laugh erupted, he's dead serious, all kidding aside }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you know anybody?}
<A>__{stern stares at him curiously, sitting there taking another sip of his cognac, placid as a large dog.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{jews, yeah. investors.}
<C>__{stern}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{well, they wouldn't own it, i'd own it. i'd pay them back in product. they can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.}
<A>__{he shrugs; it sounds more than fair to him. but not to stern.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{pots and pans.}
<C>__{schindler}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{something they can hold in their hands.}
<A>__{stern studies him. this man is nothing more than a salesman with a salesman's pitch; just dressed better than most.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{i don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.}
<C>__{schindler}
<P>__{(a slow knowing nod)}
<D>__{they should be.}
<A>__{silence.}
