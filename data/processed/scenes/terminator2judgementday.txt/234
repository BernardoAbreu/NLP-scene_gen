<C>__{john}
<D>__{and that's another thing. you could lighten up a bit, yourself. this severe routine is getting old. smile once in a while.}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{smile?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah. smile. you know. people smile, right? watch.}
<A>__{goes to the order window.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(smiling broadly)}
<D>__{hi. nice place you got here. how's business?}
<C>__{window woman}
<P>__{(stone faced)}
<D>__{gimme a break.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(to terminator)}
<D>__{okay. bad example. over there, look.}
<A>__{john points at three teenage guys standing at a drinking fountain nearby. one of them has said something funny and the others are laughing, grinning.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{like that.}
<A>__{terminator pov (digitized) the real time image continues while a replay of one of the guys grinning runs in a window. it expands, so that the guy's mouth fills the window. replays again in slow motion. a vector graphic of the lips smiling appears, along with an array of symbolic data. terminator tries it. the result is dismal. a rictus like curling of the lip. terminator's next effort is a marginal improvement.}

<D>__{i don't know, maybe you could practice in front of a mirror or something.}
