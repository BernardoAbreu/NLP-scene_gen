<A>__{snickers and butterfinger calmly blow away both guards with silenced mini uzis. soviet guard four rushes out a door before the agents, zipping up his fly. almond joy twists his neck with an agonizing snap.}
<B>__{the long hallway}
<A>__{hawk, anna, and alex retreat beneath the lenin mural through the windowed double doors. behind the doors, they poke up to see a bespectacled guard emerge from the darkness to check out the door.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{now that's a lock.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{don't worry, we'll get it...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{can i sing this time, too? please?}
<A>__{hawk and alex are not thrilled about the idea, but anna's eye flutter does it.}

<A>__{the soviet v.i.p.'s open up presents of pink l.a. gear tennis shoes, silly t shirts, and nintendo joysticks as a standing darwin hypnotizes them.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{i look at you soviet people and i feel... pity... superiority. most of your life, your government has told you that capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a cadillac than hear the laughter of children.}

<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{we're here to say, your government was right.}

<D>__{"oh this lock is a pain in the bu utt"}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{"how'd we ever get such in a ru utt"}

<B>__{the hallway above}
<A>__{the cia team saunters through corpses up to a door similar in lock and design to the one hawk and alex are working on. snickers's computer screen shows the blue light directly above the green light.}

<C>__{almond joy}
<D>__{snickers, baby, i love you like a brother, but really, who cares? silencer bomb...}
<A>__{butterfinger pulls from around his shoulder a strange rifle. he attaches to the front of it;, a glass encased, suctioning time bomb from a waist satchel. he fires the bomb against the door and it starts ticking.}

<A>__{come hawk, alex, and anna, panting.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{that was close....}

<D>__{you can be lookout!..... take alex's gun.}

<B>__{the hallway above}
<A>__{the cia bomb blows up the door with a weird silencer sound. kaplan and the candy bars giddily whoop as they rush through the smoking door. the ballroom second level anna meanders across the second level muttering to herself in italian and amusingly imitating hawk's condescension.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{"you can be the lookout."}
<A>__{anna suddenly moves past the pillar to see the mayflowers and the v.i.p.s. she gasps and hurls herself behind the second level railing.}
