<L>__{43 astronauts continue march,}
<A>__{across the top of the hills there suddenly runs a line of fire (black dunes).}
<L>__{44 they move across the terrain}
<A>__{jagged bolts of lightning flash across the sky, but bring, no rain, and thunder claps sound like heavy artillery. (gray area)}
<L>__{45 out 58}
<T>__{quick dissolve to:}
<L>__{59 another part of the canyon (ochre dunes area) group}
<A>__{shot day several huge boulders are dislodged, and the three astronauts run. wildly to escape the falling rocks. when the avalanche ends, they sprawl on the lifeless sands, breathing heavily and drenched with sweat, surrounded by enormous boulders. taylor looks about him.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{everybody all right?}
<A>__{murmurs of assent from dodge and landon. taylor rummages through a limp rucksack, comes up with some empty food cartons,rummages again, coming up with a cigar butt.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{water check.}
<A>__{dodge takes a plastic canteen from another rucksack and inspects it.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{eight ounces.}
<A>__{dodge lies back and looks up at the sky.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{it doesn't add up. there's a mantle of dust around this planet and yet it's as humid as a jungle. thunder and lightning and yet no rain. cloud cover every night and that strange luminosity, and yet no moon.}
<A>__{landon also looks up at the sky.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{if only we could get a fix.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(needling him)}
<D>__{what would you learn? i've told you where you are and when you are.}
<C>__{dodge}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{taylor quit riding him.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(harshly, to landon)}
<D>__{you're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{all right }
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{there's only one reality left. we're here and it's now. you get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i'm prepared to die.}
<A>__{taylor turns to dodge, throws up his hands.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{he's prepared to die! doesn't that make you misty? chalk up another victory for the human spirit!}
<A>__{dodge rises and moves off, o.s., either embarrassed by this colloquy or unwilling to hear it again. taylor, cigar clamped between his teeth, spins toward landon.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{straighten me out on something. why did you come along at all? you volunteered. why?}
<P>__{(a beat; no answer)}
<D>__{i will tell you. they nominated you for the big one and you couldn't turn it down. not without losing your all american standing}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(hard)}
<D>__{climb off me, will you!}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{and the glory, don't forget that. there's a life sized bronze statue of you somewhere. it's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. but never let it be said we forget our heroes.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{taylor. i'm telling you }
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{oh, and one last item. immortality. you wanted to go on forever.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{well, you damn near made it. except for dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. and with stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. you got what you wanted, kid. how does it taste?}
<A>__{silence. taylor lies down, spent of his venom, pillowing his head on a rucksack.}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{okay. you read me well enough. why can't i read you?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{don't bother}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(looking off)}
<D>__{dodge ... he's not like me at all. but he makes sense. held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. i understand why he's here. but you...you're no seeker. you're negative.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{but i'm not prepared to die.}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(heatedly)}
<D>__{i'd like to know why not. you thought life on earth was meaningless. you despised people. so what did you do? you ran away.}
<A>__{taylor's eyes are closed. he is silent for a moment. when he speaks, his tone is soft, reflective.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{no, not quite, landon. i'm a bit of a seeker myself. but my dreams are a lot emptier than yours.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i can't get rid of the idea that somewhere in the universe there must be a creature superior to man.}
