<L>__{interior detectivzs' room, blue bay police station night}
<A>__{the room is dark and empty, with the exception of a single desk lamp, by which halo we find... ray duquette, in an aloha shirt, waiting as his computer's printer finishes a job, as suddenly... ... a new light rushes into the room. ray turns to find gloria standing in the doorway. he stops as his printer finishes the job. he pulls out the paper, looks at it, smiles. gloria walks to his desk.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you saw the news today?}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{lombardo's settlement?}
<A>__{ray nods.}
<C>__{gloria }
<D>__{yeah, well, i told you they were gonna make us look stupid.}
<A>__{ray gives her a long look. gloria waits a moment, shrugs.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hey, don't back away from it, you were right. we did look stupid.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what you were wrong about, is who made us look that way.}
<A>__{gloria just looks at him, puzzled.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial. lombardo had an affair with sandra, right?}
<P>__{(gloria nods)}
<D>__{so why not tell us about the affair? i mean it could be a hell of a motive for kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{maybe lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i thought of that. then i said, come on, you're lombardo. your reputation is getting trashed. you want to stop the bleeding. you don't want to sit in jail for three months. unless...}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{unless what?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{unless you're setting up sandra van ryan for the big payday.}
<A>__{it is quiet in the office, save for the soft buzz of ray's}
<B>__{computer.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{they chumped us, gloria, right from the start.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{why? you ask me, lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{the job looks okay to us. but look at it from his point of view. the man's surrounded by wealth and privilege. but for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.}
<A>__{gloria gives this a moment's thought.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{your old man graduates from blue bay school, you're not supposed to wind up there. board of directors maybe, but not in the lousy guidance office. now. point number two.}
<P>__{(he taps at the printout on his desk)}
<D>__{i've run a financial on lombardo. guy was eyeball deep in debt before this all happened trying to keep up with pricey trim like barbara baxter.}
<A>__{he passes the printout to gloria. she looks at it, thinking.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{so what about the girls? suzie's poor, but why would kelly have to steal from her own mother? surely her father...}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{her father didn't leave her squat. the kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and sandra seems to have the idea that kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.}
<A>__{gloria looks over lombardo's financial once more, tosses it on the desk, then studies ray long beat.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{this one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i flat don't like the guy, glory. he's dirty. and i will tell you something else. you want to know how old man lombardo lost his money?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he was fucked out of it by old man van ryan, on a little item known as the salt creek land deal.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it was after the war. van ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him. the freeway went to the coast, right where van ryan wanted it.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{eliminate the competition.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you got it. the rich got richer. while the saps like lombardo went belly up in the swamp.}
<A>__{gloria looks at him a long moment.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(a long beat; then beneath a smile)}
<D>__{i net a guy in a bar.}
