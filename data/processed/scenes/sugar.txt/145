<A>__{the camera eerily floats toward and around miguel on the mound. he stares down the hitter, totally focused. he touches his cross, whispers a prayer to himself. winds up, throws, and... thud! ...a cloud of dust pops off the catcher's mitt, just like the old days. miguel's "stuff" is back. and he knows it. in the stands. earl and helen settle into their box seats eating caramel corn and cola. radio announcers booth. jack jefferies at the mic...}

<D>__{miguel santos appears to be in top form tonight, striking out two of three in the first. i don't want to jinx it, but this sure looks like the santos we knew earlier this season.}
<A>__{in the dugout. there's an intensity we haven't seen before in miguel. we get the sense he's treating this game like it could be his last. on the mound 2nd inning close on miguel. sweating more than he should at this point in the game, but... ...who cares? he continues to dominate opposing hitters, striking out two more in the 2nd. in the stands. earl and helen cheer for their miguel. in the dugout later that night still sweating, miguel is now shifting his jaw back and forth. the sound fades low, as he stares onto the field, sees... ...the teams changing sides between innings, everyone moving in subtle slow motion (36 fps). stu approaches miguel, puts his hand on his shoulder. we see him mouth the words, "you okay?", but no sound comes out. miguel nods, yes. back on the field 5th inning and back in real time (24 fps). miguel fires his first pitch over the head of his catcher and all the way to the backstop. orlando motions for him to calm down. the next pitch is closer, but still high. and the next pitch beans the hitter in the thigh. miguel swears at himself, tries hard to calm down, but his heart is racing.}

<D>__{strike!}
<A>__{orlando nods, encouraging. throws the ball back. miguel takes another deep breath. he whispers a prayer to himself, grabs the ball in his spike curve grip, and... ...his next pitch is rocked to deep left field. miguel immediately lowers his head, unable to watch. we hold on his anguished reaction, as the hitter circles the bases. stu shakes his head in disappointment. from the bullpen, salvador watches, concerned. from the stands, earl and helen clap for encouragement. e164 miguel does his best to shake it off, but he keeps muttering toe164 himself, which makes him look crazy. another deep breath. another pitch... uh oh. this one almost finds the batter's head, as he falls to the dirt to avoid contact. it's on.}

<A>__{both benches clear, as players rush out onto the field to restore order. miguel and the batter continue jawing at each other, while the other players swirl around them, creating little sub conflicts of their own. it's a mess. the sound fades to silence and the image blends to slo mo again. there's something poetic about a bunch of men in child like baseball uniforms, screaming at each other in silence. miguel looks around, perhaps recognizing this for himself... hold, until... ...he calmly walks off the field, leaving the chaos behind.}
