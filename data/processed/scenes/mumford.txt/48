<L>__{exterior high school athletic field day}
<A>__{another day. mumford is leading sofie through the lightest set of calisthenics ever devised. now they're doing waist bends and arm waving. even so, it's taking everything sofie's got.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{i don't know if i mentioned the headaches.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{did you get headaches before this?}
<P>__{(sofie: yes)}
<D>__{but you get more now? or more severe?}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{no, not really. they're about the same. my marriage was one long headache.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{so the headaches may not even be a part of this?}
<A>__{she considers that, reluctantly agrees.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i can give myself a headache instantly.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{is that like a party trick?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{all i have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... like i will think 'taking these walks is going to help sofie get better.' but then i will also think 'mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'}
<A>__{sofie's not sure how to take that. she looks away.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{there... i've given myself a real whopper.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{you actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?}
<P>__{(mumford laughs)}
<D>__{so you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. it makes tiny little tears in our fabric.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.}
