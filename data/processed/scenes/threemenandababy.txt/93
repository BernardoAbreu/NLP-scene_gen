<A>__{a broadly smiling jack arrives at the riverside. paul is sitting on a bench. when he sees jack, he gets up and comes to greet him, smiling and extending his hand. without warning, jack suddenly jumps him and sends him with a forceful shove flying into the water. paul lands on his back with a big splash, and comes back up to the surface totally dumbfounded. jack leans over the water and yells at him, like a madman, still a bit drunk.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that was for your 'little' package, and consider yourself lucky i didn't turn you in to the cops! and get one thing into your thick skull: i have never touched dope, and i never will. you and your shit dealing, you can go straight to hell, and you can take the money you make from it and stick it up your ass! so long.}
