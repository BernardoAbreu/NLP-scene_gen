<A>__{tight on : tv screen}
<L>__{70 71 interior ted's apartment night 70 71}
<A>__{where edward g. robinson (as the character keyes in "double indemnity") grills a man about a fake insurance claim.}
<C>__{edward g. robinson}
<D>__{"every time one of these phonies comes along it ties knots in my stomach... i can't eat. that's how i knew your claim was crooked..."}
<A>__{at the sound of doorbell, the whole scene freezes. we are tiffany at her desk, working on the computer. ted has paused the dvd, puts down the barnell file and opens the door on a snow covered pizza guy, soggy pizza box in hand.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{pizza guy}
<D>__{hi there. that'll be $12.97.}
<A>__{ted looks at his watch.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what about thirty minutes or free?}
<C>__{pizza guy}
<D>__{doesn't apply when it's snowing.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(digging out his wallet)}
<D>__{so nine months of the year your guarantee is worthless?}
<C>__{pizza guy}
<D>__{it doesn't snow every day.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{they should really tell people when they order.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{would you just give him the money already?}
<C>__{pizza guy}
<D>__{it's not my decision.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i know that. i'm just saying.}
<C>__{pizza guy}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you understand though?}
<C>__{pizza guy}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it wouldn't take much.}
<C>__{pizza guy}
<D>__{full disclosure to the pizza consumer. i will be sure to pass that along.}
<A>__{the delivery guy leaves. ted walks back into the living room. tiffany comes over, grabs a slice.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{why you gotta argue with the service industry?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{the problem with people today is they don't expect anyone to tell the truth. we've just come to accept lying as acceptable.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{if this is another passive aggressive shot at psychic buddies, all our ads state "for amusement purposes only."}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{tiff, it has nothing to do with... look, just forget it.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{you remember being amused, don't ya, honey? what is with you anyway?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{want to know what's "with" me? i'm on the verge of cracking the biggest case of my career, one that corporate has to notice, and nobody gives a crap. not my boss, and not even my girlfriend.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{so this is my fault?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no, it's not your fault. i just want to live somewhere where road hazards don't have antlers and the pizza doesn't have to be delivered by dogsled.}
<A>__{tiffany storms off as ted flops onto the couch, swipes the snow from the top of the pizza box and hits play on the dvd.}
<C>__{edward g. robinson}
<D>__{"what kind of outfit is this, anyway? are we an insurance company or a bunch of dim witted amateurs to write a policy on a mug like that?"}
<A>__{tiffany turns from the bedroom door, almost in tears.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{you know, even though edward g. robinson wins, everyone like fred macmurray better.}
<A>__{she slams the door. ted doesn't move, lost in his own world.}
