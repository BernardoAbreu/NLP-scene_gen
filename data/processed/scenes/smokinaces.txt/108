<A>__{the supervisor sputters stammers, realizes he just slipped.}
<C>__{security supervisor}
<D>__{uh well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so }
<C>__{acosta}
<D>__{so there are no guests staying on that floor?}
<A>__{the supervisor makes a big show of the headshake "no...."}
<C>__{security supervisor}
<D>__{no. none at present.}
<A>__{acosta grins, takes a step closer.}
<C>__{acosta}
<D>__{c'mon bill...you've got some sultan up there, one of your whales, big spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?}
<C>__{security supervisor}
<D>__{no, no, no. we've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. the security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.}
<C>__{acosta}
<D>__{is your security team armed?}
<C>__{security supervisor}
<D>__{of course. yes.}
<C>__{acosta}
<D>__{and who has access to that floor?}
<A>__{the supervisor...something like suspicion in his eyes. the secure "hotline" begins to ring. the supervisor looks over at the phone, then back at acosta...the unflappable pro.}
<D>__{acosta (contd) (cont'd) bill, listen, i can ask you now and you can answer me, or i can drag you up to san francisco and depose you in front of a federal judge. because that's where we're headed here.}
<A>__{bullshit, but it sounds good. the supervisor starts for the ringing hotline.}
<C>__{security supervisor}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but i'm going to need to see your identification again. we're covering some sensitive material here and i need to safeguard myself, i'm sure you can understand.}
<A>__{acosta, reaching into his coat.}
<C>__{acosta}
<D>__{of course, but if you could just tell me who has access to that floor }
<A>__{the supervisor touches a pass key that he wears on a chain around his neck as he moves to answer the phone.}
<C>__{security supervisor}
<D>__{ i hold the sole pass key and personally relieve the shifts myself. now if i could get your id we can }
<A>__{ acosta, coming out of his coat, fake id in hand, the supervisor reaching for it and the ringing phone simultaneously suddenly a six inch, spring loaded stiletto blade explodes from acosta's sleeve, piercing the id pinning it to the supervisor's chest. a surprised grunt from the man as blood begins to pour from his punctured sternum. the blade retracts. the phone sits trembling in the supervisor's hand, a voice carruther's, tinny and barely audible, warbles from the other end }
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(over phone)}
<D>__{hello? this is special agent donald carruthers of the fbi, i need an }
<A>__{acosta takes the phone from the stunned supervisor, replacing it on the console. the supervisor, still confused by the exchange, wanting to speak, but unsure of what to say...he gazes down to the red blossom fanning across his shirt front.}
<C>__{security supervisor}
<D>__{is...that...blood?}
<A>__{acosta pockets his id as he yanks the pass key off the supervisor's neck. his natural accent returns.}
<C>__{acosta}
<D>__{yes it is and right now it's filling your lungs. in less than a minute, you'll asphyxiate and pass out. you shouldn't be feeling any pain now.}
<A>__{the supervisor's knees begin to buckle, nervous system slowly shutting down. acosta steadies him, easing him to the floor.}
<C>__{acosta }
<D>__{close your eyes. think of something wonderful. don't make this face the last thing you ever see.}
<P>__{(beat, in spanish)}
<D>__{heaven may hold it against you.}
<A>__{the supervisor, unblinking, an almost childlike clarity there.}
<C>__{security supervisor}
<D>__{...am i really dying...?}
<A>__{acosta, deadpan.}
<C>__{acosta}
<D>__{bill }
<P>__{(out of respect)}
<D>__{willliam...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we're all dying...}
<A>__{bill the supervisor almost smiles as he breathes his last breath...acosta checks for a pulse, then drags his body toward a service closet. as he passes one of the video monitors... ...we see on screen: the employee entrance, grave and swing shifts on their way out, day shift on it's way in. mixed in with this personnel rotation, each doing his inconspicuous best...the brothers tremor.}
