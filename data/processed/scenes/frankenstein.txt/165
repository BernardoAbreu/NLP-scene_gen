<D>__{i want her.}
<A>__{victor stares down in utter horror. her cold, dead face. blue lips already beginning to shrivel. purple, sunken eyes. knowing that she loved him. knowing it's his fault she's dead. he can barely get the words out:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{why... her?}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{her body pleases me.}
<A>__{that's it for victor. he turns away, stomach heaving. it's all he can do to keep from throwing up.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{materials, remember? nothing more. your words.}
<A>__{victor hesitates, pulling himself together. softly:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{my words.}
<A>__{he turns back, forcing himself to examine the body, trying not to view it as someone he knows. he cradles the head, probing the back of the neck with his fingers.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{the brain stem was destroyed by the hanging. we'll need another. the body looks like it will do, but some extremities are too decayed. they'll have to be replaced. the fresher the better.}
