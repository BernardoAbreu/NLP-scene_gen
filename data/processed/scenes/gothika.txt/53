<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{did you mention that to the cops?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i didn't think it would help you.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{it means they wouldn't have let me treat you if they thought i had any kind of involvement in what happened.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{and did you?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{did i what?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{did i make it to your place? did i see you that night?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{no. we got disconnected and i couldn't get through to you. i sat there waiting all night. figured you'd changed your mind.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me this before?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{because the only way you'll be able to accept these events is if you remember them on your own. my job is to assist you in processing that information because you're not in a frame of mind to do it by yourself.}
<A>__{she stares at him. queasy.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you're changing the subject.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{the subject is you don't trust me.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{right now i don't trust anyone.}
<A>__{she tries to read his face. reminds herself of who pete is and what he means to her. he points at her bandaged arm.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you want to talk about today?}
<A>__{she takes a resigned breath, slowly shakes her head. wishing she could wake up from this nightmare:}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i want to talk to my lawyer.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i think that's premature.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i can't help what you think.}
