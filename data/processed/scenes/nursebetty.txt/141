<L>__{interior rosa's apartment living room same time}
<A>__{wesley is engrossed in watching "a reason to love." behind him, ballard quietly walks his feet up the wall until he's completely upside down. he rubs one foot against the other until one pantleg is above his cowboy boot. rosa and roy watch. he finally lifts the boot off. it falls soundlessly onto his chest. a small pistol is revealed, holstered above his ankle. he works the holster open using the edge of the fishtank. roy and rosa cough loudly at the same time to cover the noise. wesley glares at them. ballard gets the pistol free. but it falls into the fishtank. the air goes out of roy's sails. ballard has fucked up again. on screen, chloe and jasmine kiss and embrace. wesley reacts as if he was slapped.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{... goddamn!}
<A>__{wesley immediately runs the sequence back to view it again. ballard kicks the wall of the fishtank with his cowboy boot. roy and rosa cover the sound again with coughing. wesley pauses the t.v. and looks around.}
<C>__{wesley }
<D>__{what's your problem?}
<A>__{ballard kicks at the tank again. but he can't break the glass. roy can't take it any more. he launches himself at the tank, grabs it by the rim and pulls it down on top of himself. a torrent of water, fish, plants and gravel pours down upon him.}
<C>__{wesley }
<D>__{you stupid piece of fuck!}
<A>__{he leaps at roy and starts kicking him savagely. rosa throws herself onto wesley's back, knocking him to the floor. ballard paws through the muck, scattering fish and gravel everywhere. he spots a glint of metal in the sand. wesley struggles out from under rosa. just as he gets free, ballard fires, hitting him twice into his chest. wesley stares in disbelief at the blood rushing out of him. then at ballard, as if trying to link the two. he slumps to the floor and opens his mouth to scream ...}

<A>__{charlie opens the bedroom door.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{wesley??!}
<A>__{charlie sees wesley turn to him as ballard fires again. wesley's face explodes. the flying lead drives charlie back to the bedroom. crawling through the muck, roy notices a fish flopping helplessly on the carpet inches from his face.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{those're japanese koi!}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{yes! how'd you know that?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you gotta get 'em in water right away!}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{we're in a shootout, roy! shut up about the damn fish!}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you shut up!}
<P>__{(to rosa)}
<D>__{they're beautiful, but get them some water.}
<A>__{he gently hands her the fish, then picks up wesley's nearby gun. rosa nods; she's amazed that he knew what it was. she looks at roy in a slightly different way before crawling away toward the kitchen.}
