<A>__{guido, dante and fausto hurry through the studio en route to the production offices. behind them is a large poster of claudia, starring in guido's last movie, a failure, la donna moderna (the modern woman). as guido passes he causes a mild stir, and many people nod deferentially, offer a maestro, or dottore. guido nods.}

<D>__{yes, but please, please, i think it's customary for there to be an approved script and budget before filming commences...}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{is he going to follow us?}
<C>__{fausto}
<D>__{it's not my intention to be difficult. maestro, i am a huge admirer of maestro contini's movies, your early films are...everybody loves them and... i consider it a great honour for me to be here now... none the less, i need a script and a budget.}
<A>__{neither dante nor guido respond. fausto flounders. they make their way to the production offices. everywhere signs for the movie, italia.}
