<CHAR>__{SETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{SETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sometimes I get boners so big I can't hide them. And then I get nervous and my heart starts pounding, and it all just, like, feeds my boner. It just becomes this...thing...that's attached to me. And it won't go away.}

<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How can that possibly suck? I'd be fuckin' psyched if I'd gotten with a girl that hot. You got, like, two dozen handjobs!}
<CHAR>__{SETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're like Orson Welles.}
<CHAR>__{SETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Exactly! If I'd built up to it, I'd probably at least be having steady sex with a mediocre-looking girl at this point. I honestly now see why Orson Welles ate his fat ass to death.}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You'll have sex in college. Everyone does. And if not, you'll have the Bang Bus.}
<CHAR>__{SETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But the key is to be good at sex by the time you're in college. You don't want girls to think you suck dick at fucking.}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I still think you've got a chance with Jules. She got mad hot over last summer, and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause she still flirts with you.}
<CHAR>__{SETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you joking, man? Let's see here...she dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber and what's-his-face. All of those were cool guys. She's been hot way longer than you think. Why would she end her high school career with me?}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir.}
<CHAR>__{SETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, and he was a complete fucking loser. You're a step up from that. Which is why you should stop being a pussy and do her! You could nailthe shit out of her for, like, two months before you leave. That bitch looks like a good fucker.}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey! I'm sick of you talking about her like that, man!}
<ACTION>__{Evan starts to walk out. Seth follows.}
<CHAR>__{SETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What, you can talk about that bitch all day every single day, but I can't say one thing about her?}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't constantly insult her.}
<CHAR>__{SETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I didn't insult her! I said she looks like a good fucker! She looks like she can take a dick. That's a good thing. Some women pride themselves on their dick- taking abilities.}

<DIAL>__{Wow. You really bitched out on that one.}
