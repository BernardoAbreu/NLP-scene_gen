<B>__{outside the shopping mall}
<A>__{parker races out the door. boom! that was left knee cap. he tumbles to the street. his gun flying from his hand. parker crawls desperately toward his weapon. but not fast enough. sid 6.7 arrives at the weapon first.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{so close, and yet, so far...}
<A>__{he kicks the weapon down the sidewalk, then points his gun at parker's head.}
<C>__{sid 6.7 }
<D>__{it's really too bad you have to miss the grand finale.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i thought you liked me being in the audience. don't you want me to see it?}
<A>__{sid 6.7 pauses to think about it.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<P>__{(considering the idea)}
<D>__{you know, i do want you to see it.}
<A>__{he shoots parker in his other knee cap, rendering both of his legs useless.}
<C>__{sid 6.7 }
<D>__{i want you to have a bird's eye view...}
<A>__{outside the newly constructed hollywood tower a 67 story monument to engineering brilliance in this land of earthquakes. 6:30 pm.}
<B>__{on the roof of the hollywood tower}
<A>__{the view is incredible. you can see from the pacific to downtown. from lax to the hollywood bowl. smog must be getting better in the near future. sid 6.7 ties parker to a chair at the roof's very edge. he is facing downtown. including the biltmore hotel, the location of mayor bennett's reelection rally.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{there you go best seat in the house.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(with some surprise)}
<D>__{you are going after mayor bennett.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{let's just say i'm sending a very clear message to his reelection rally...}
<A>__{he walks toward an open stairway door behind them.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{aren't you going to watch with me?}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{i've got some final preparations to take care of checking his watch, he stops suddenly.}
<B>__{on his watch}
<A>__{time is moving backwards. literally.}
<B>__{on the roof of the hollywood tower}
<A>__{sid 6.7 pauses, then goes over to parker and checks his watch. it is also moving backwards. a smile of realization spreads slowly across sid 6.7's face as he admires the beautiful sky above him.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<P>__{(as if to god)}
<D>__{thank you, daryl.}
<P>__{(turning to parker)}
<D>__{you had me going for quite a while there, sport.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{i really did think i was still in reality. at least, until now.}
<P>__{(looking upward)}
<D>__{beam me up, scotty!}
<A>__{his body disintegrates before your eyes. it's electronic particles form into an amorphous cloud. which disappears from view.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{madison, get me out of here! madison!}
<A>__{lindenmeyer watches parker scream on the monitor. madison remains unconscious on the floor behind him.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer}
<P>__{(to the monitor)}
<D>__{she's taking a nap at the moment.}
<A>__{he types a set of instructions into the console and hits}
<B>__{enter.}
<C>__{lindenmeyer }
<D>__{but don't worry. you won't be alone for very long. fairly soon, you'll be dead.}
<A>__{he removes the sid 6.7 character module from its slot and exits the station.}
<B>__{on the roof of the hollywood tower}
<A>__{one side of parker's chair gradually starts to rise. parker looks down to see the roof surrealistically swelling beneath his chair. this could only happen in virtual reality. in a matter of minutes, he is going to be thrown over the roof's edge. the next stop is 693 feet down.}
<B>__{inside letac}
<A>__{parker's screams for help echo throughout the facility. but there is no one there to hear him.}
