<D>__{spock...! spock, where ... how ...?}
<A>__{kirk, smiling, is moving toward spock with hand out stretched. but spock has already turned and moved toward the science console where decker sits.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{commander, if i may...?}
<B>__{at science console}
<A>__{it takes decker a moment to realize that spock wants to take over the console. he begins getting to his feet, throwing kirk a look. but kirk's attention is totally on spock. and spock is already intent on com putations he is beginning to punch into the science console computer.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{i have been monitoring your starfleet transmissions, captain, your engine design difficulties.}
<A>__{spock continues to punch information into the science computer a monitor screen image begins to show com plex equations which spock inspects he makes a further computer punch out and inspects a second monitor image of other equations. only then does spock seem to become aware of kirk and decker standing there with questioning expressions.}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i offer my services as science officer.}
<A>__{kirk starts to grin then remembers to wipe it off his face as he turns to decker.}

<A>__{but as chapel crosses to spock, her pleased smile brightening her whole face, spock turns, dismisses her presence with a cold disinterested glance chapel stops, stands dumbfounded. spock gives mccoy a similar glance turns back to his console readings as:}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{that's how we all feel, mister...}
<A>__{the same cold glance causes uhura to stop in mid sentence. several grins directed toward spock are now fading from bridge crew faces. spock has turned back again for a last quick reading at the console and now stands totally ignoring everyone else as he speaks coolly, unemotionally to kirk:}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{with your permission, i will now discuss these fuel equations with the engineer.}
<A>__{kirk manages a nod, a bit dumbfounded himself at spock's strange manner. spock heads for the elevator puz zled expressions from the entire bridge crew. then kirk calls after him, very sincerely:}
<C>__{kirk}
