<D>__{it won't be the last. to the pain means the first thing you lose will be your feet, below the ankles, then your hands at the wrists, next your nose.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{humperdinck}
<A>__{gripping his sword, watching.}
<C>__{humperdinck}
<D>__{ and then my tongue, i suppose. i killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake i don't mean to duplicate tonight.}
<C>__{westley}
<D>__{i wasn't finished the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right }
<C>__{humperdinck}
<P>__{(takes step forward)}
<D>__{ and then my ears, i understand. let's get on with it}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{close up: westley huge}
<C>__{westley}
<D>__{wrong! your ears you keep, and i will tell you why }
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{humperdinck}
<A>__{and now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.}
<C>__{westley}
<D>__{ so that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish every babe that weeps at your approach, every woman who cries out, "dear god, what is that thing?" will echo in your perfect ears.}
<C>__{westley }
<D>__{that is what "to the pain" means. it means i leave you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{humperdinck}
<A>__{doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside him.}
<C>__{humperdinck}
<D>__{i think you're bluffing }
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{westley}
<A>__{lying there, staring at him.}
<C>__{westley}
<D>__{it's possible, pig i might be bluffing it's conceivable, you miserable vomitous mass, that i'm only lying here because i lack the strength to stand then again, perhaps i have the strength after all.}
<A>__{and now, slowly, westley begins to move. his body turns, his feet go to the floor, he starts to stand }
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{humperdinck}
<A>__{staring, eyes wide.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{westley}
<A>__{and now he is standing, sword in fighting position.}
<C>__{westley}
<P>__{(slow and determined)}
<D>__{drop your sword.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{prince humperdinck}
<A>__{and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind his watch. he throws his sword to the floor.}
<C>__{westley}
<P>__{(to humperdinck)}
<D>__{have a seat.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{westley}

<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{where's fezzik?}
<C>__{westley}
<D>__{i thought he was with you.}

<P>__{(to buttercup)}
<D>__{help him.}
<C>__{buttercup}
<D>__{why does westley need helping?}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{because he has no strength }

<B>__{humperdinck}
<A>__{and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds.}
<C>__{humperdinck}
<D>__{i knew it! i knew you were bluffing! i knew he was bluffing.}
<C>__{inigo}
<P>__{(staring at the prince)}
<D>__{shall i dispatch him for you?}
<C>__{westley}
<P>__{(considers this, then)}
<D>__{thank you, but no whatever happens to us, i want him to live a long life alone with his cowardice.}
<C>__{fezzik}
<P>__{(off screen)}
<D>__{inigo! inigo, where are you?}
<A>__{they look at each other, then move to the balcony, and}

<B>__{fezzik}
<A>__{leading four great white horses. he glances up, sees them on the balcony.}
<C>__{fezzik}
<D>__{ah, there you are. inigo, i saw the prince's stables, and there they were, four white horses. and i thought, there are four of us, if we ever find the lad hello, lad so i took them with me, in case we ever bumped into each other.}
<P>__{(considers things a moment)}
<D>__{i guess we just did.}
<T>__{cut to:}

<D>__{fezzik, you did something right.}
<C>__{fezzik}
<D>__{don't worry i won't let it go to my head.}
<A>__{and as he holds out his great arms }
<T>__{cut to: something unexpected and very lovely:}
<A>__{buttercup floating through the air. what's happening, of course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so fezzik can catch her. but her fall is in slow motion so you might think she was flying. westley and inigo, watching as fezzik catches buttercup.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{you know, it's very strange i have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, i don't know what to do with the rest of my life.}
<C>__{westley}
