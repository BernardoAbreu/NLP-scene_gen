<L>__{interior frat house night}
<A>__{the post game party. not as raucous as after the opening game victory. a few players are dancing, but most are sitting, drinking, commiserating.}
<C>__{bud lite}
<P>__{(to alvin)}
<D>__{anybody seen joe?}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{not yet. probably out with camille. haven't seen darnell either.}
<L>__{interior upstairs bedroom night}
<A>__{lattimer's sitting on the bed with a coed named leslie. they're kissing softly, light necking. lattimer starts to unbutton her blouse. she begins to demur.}
<C>__{leslie}
<D>__{i think we better get back downstairs.}
<C>__{lattimer}
<D>__{no, leslie, we're just getting to know each other.}
<C>__{leslie}
<P>__{(starting to get up)}
<D>__{no, i think...}
<A>__{lattimer grabs her arm roughly, pulls her back to the bed. she's starting to get a little scared.}
<C>__{lattimer}
<D>__{c'mon leslie, you didn't come up here to stop now.}
<A>__{he tries to kiss her again, she pushes him away, starts for the door. angered, that steroid pump in his eyes, he grabs her again, throws her violently on the bed. she screams.}
<C>__{lattimer}
<D>__{what were you doin'? leadin' me on?}
<A>__{he gets on the bed, kneels above her. she starts to struggle. he slaps her across the face, rips her blouse open. freaked, she begins to scream and kick. enraged, lattimer slaps her around, picks her up, shakes her like a rag doll, slaps her some more, throws her to the floor. picks her up again, when suddenly the door bursts open and bud lite and alvin race in.}
<C>__{lattimer}
<P>__{(throwing leslie on the bed again)}
<D>__{get outa here!}
<A>__{bud lite and alvin charge lattimer, try to wrestle him down, but his hormone level is so high, he fights like a bull. two other players charge in and finally all four are able to shackle lattimer. he continues to struggle a bit, then gives up, a panting, sweating, shaking hulk.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{this is it, man. no more 'roids. this shit has gotta stop.}
<A>__{lattimer breaks down and cries.}
