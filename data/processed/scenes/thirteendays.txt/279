<T>__{smash cut to:}
<L>__{exterior missile site cuba continuous}
<A>__{floodlights illuminate missiles, vertical on their erectors, support vehicles, clustered across the man made clearing. mask wearing technicians wave a fuel truck back to the nearest missile. clouds of toxic vapor rise from the others. they've already been fueled.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{they are a vital threat to my country. if launched, they would kill 80 million americans.}
<T>__{smash cut to:}
<L>__{interior bobby's office continuous}
<A>__{dobrynin listens impassively, as is his professional duty.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{my brother, my friends, my countrymen and i cannot and will not permit those missiles to become operational.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i promise you that.}
<A>__{dobrynin looks out the window. and then, pained, looks back at bobby.}
<C>__{dobrynin}
<D>__{then i fear our two nations will go to war. and i fear where war will lead us.}
<A>__{bobby acknowledges him with a nod.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{if the missiles do not become operational, if you remove the missiles, then there will be no war.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{at this moment, the president is accepting the terms of secretary khruschev's letter of friday night. if the soviet union halts construction immediately, removes the missiles, and submits to u.n. inspection, the united states will pledge to never invade cuba or aid others in that enterprise.}
<A>__{dobrynin stares at bobby. stares hard.}
<C>__{dobrynin}
<D>__{if your jupiter missiles in turkey were removed also, such an accommodation could be reached.}
<A>__{the two men move their argument forward with the deliberation and formality of chess masters.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(tired sounding)}
<D>__{the united states cannot agree to such terms under threat. any belief to the contrary }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ was in error.}
<A>__{dobrynin reels internally. the only sign on his face is a slight tremor. bobby looks up, registers the calculated effect. and to dobrynin's horror, the russian believes:}
<C>__{dobrynin}
<D>__{you want war...}
<A>__{but not so fast. bobby folds his hands. and he smoothly goes from hard ass brinksman to sensitive deal maker.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{however, while there can be no quid pro quo on this issue, the united states can offer a private assurance.}
<A>__{dobrynin holds his breath.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{our jupiter missiles in turkey are obsolete, and have been scheduled for withdrawal for some time. this withdrawal should be completed within, say, six months.}
<A>__{dobrynin lets out his breath.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{of course, any public disclosure of this assurance would negate the deal and produce the most stringent denials from our government.}
<A>__{dobrynin grasps the move immediately, understanding the ramifications. still he hesitates a moment.}
<C>__{dobrynin}
<D>__{this private assurance represents the word of the highest authority?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dobrynin}
<D>__{and it can be relayed beyond comrade khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{of course. our pledge can be relayed to any government official secretary khruschev sees fit to satisfy.}
<A>__{meaning this is the bone he can show the hard line. dobrynin struggles internally, knowing what bobby has done, wanting to hug him. it comes across as agitation.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{with the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. i cannot stress this point enough.}
<C>__{dobrynin}
<D>__{tomorrow...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{tomorrow...}
<A>__{dobrynin rises from his chair. bobby rises with him.}
<C>__{dobrynin}
<D>__{then you must excuse me and permit me to relay the substance of our discussion to my superiors.}
<A>__{dobrynin heads for the door. half way there he turns back to bobby, deeply moved. deeply grateful.}
<C>__{dobrynin }
<D>__{we have heard stories that some among your military men wish for war.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you are a good man. your brother is a good man. i assure you there are other good men. let us hope the will of good men is enough to counter the terrible strength of this thing which has been put in motion.}
