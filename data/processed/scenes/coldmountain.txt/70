<C>__{ada }
<D>__{ or wished i did.}
<C>__{ruby }
<D>__{that cow wants milking.}
<A>__{ada looks up from her writing with a start. she covers her letter, guiltily, instinctively. in front of her, at the gate, is a young rawboned, feral woman, of indeterminate origins. she is barefoot, and dressed in a hand dye shift of blue. her name is ruby.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{if that letter ain't urgent, the cow is is what i'm saying.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i don't know you.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{old lady swanger says you need some help. here i am.}
<A>__{ada is instantly defensive, intimidated.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i need help, i need, i do need help, but i need a laborer there's plowing and rough work and i think there's been a misunderstanding.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{what's the rake for?}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{the rake?}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{ain't for gardening, that's for sure. number one you got a horse i can plow all day. i'm a worker. number two there's no man better than me cause there's no man around who ain't old or full of mischief. i know your plight.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{my plight?}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{am i hard to hear cause you keep repeating everything. i'm not looking for money, never cared for it and now it ain't worth nothing. i expect to board and eat at the same table. i'm not a servant. do you get my meaning?}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{you're not a servant.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{people'll have to empty their own night jars, that's my pointerior}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{and i'm not planning to work while you watch neither.}

<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{is that a yes or a no?}
<C>__{ada}

<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{there's half the day yet. let's make a start. my name's ruby. i know your name.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{the rake: there's a rooster devil, i'm sure of it. he's lucifer himself. i go near him he's at me with his spurs.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{i despise a flogging rooster. where is he?}
<A>__{ada gets up, nods to the corner of the yard. ruby goes over. the rooster gathers himself up for a new opponent.}
<B>__{in one movement she picks up the bird and twists off its head.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{let's put him in a pot.}
