<L>__{interior house night}
<A>__{jenny comes in and locks the door. she passes through the kitchen and is on her way to the stairs when the star man steps out of the darkness in the living room. a scream catches in jenny's throat.}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(precise)}
<D>__{wehave...}
<A>__{jenny bolts for the front door. at the end of the hallway her foot catches in a phone cord pulling the phone off an end table. the receiver is jarred out of its cradle. jenny regains her balance and gets to the door ahead of the star man. she jerks it open, but the guard chain stops it three inches from the jamb. frantically, she tries again but the chain holds. the star man slams the door shut and reaches out to grab her. she flails back at him. one of her hands strikes the panel on his chest and the identification light comes on inside his helmet. at the sight of the star man, jenny begins to scream. he presses her back against the wall and puts a mittened hand over her mouth.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{wehave...}
<A>__{jenny ceases her struggle and begins to cry. the star man takes his hand away from her mouth.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{please don't hurt me... please... please.}
<A>__{holding her with his eyes he grasps one of jenny's hands and lifts it up to look at it. he raises a piece of skin off her wrist, rolls it between his thumb and forefinger. jenny lets out a blood curdling scream and strikes out at him. flashes of light erupt off his exposed chest where she hits. the ferocity of her attack knocks him aside and she sprints up the stairs. the star man recovers and starts after her.}
