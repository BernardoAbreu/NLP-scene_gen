<L>__{exterior ford's work area day}
<A>__{just beyond the work area solomon speaks with ford as tibeats listens. solomon is drawing in the dirt, making rough diagrams for ford as he explains himself.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{the creek is plenty deep enough to sail, even with a boat full of load. the distance from the work area to the point on the latter bayou is several miles by water fewer than land. it occurs to me that the expense of the transportation would be materially diminished }
<C>__{tibeats}
<D>__{"materially diminished?"}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{if we use the waterway.}
<C>__{tibeats}
<D>__{it's a scheme. plenty of engineers have schemed similarly. the passes are too tight.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{i reckon them at more than twelve feet at their most narrow. wide enough for a tub to traverse. a team of niggers can clear it out.}
<C>__{tibeats}
<D>__{and you know what of transport and terra formin'?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{i labored repairing the champlain canal, on the section over which william van nortwick was superintendent. with my earnings i hired several efficient hands to assist me, and i entered into contracts for the transportation of large rafts of timber from lake champlain to troy.}
<C>__{ford}
<P>__{(to tibeats)}
<D>__{i will admit to being impressed even if you won't.}
<P>__{(to solomon)}
<D>__{collect a gang, see what good you can do.}
