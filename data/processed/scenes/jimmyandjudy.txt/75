<C>__{judy }
<D>__{thanks for marrying me. you're my prince charming that came and swooped me off me feet.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{shhhh. shut up.}
<P>__{(grabbing camera)}
<D>__{give it to me.}
<A>__{jimmy whips the camera around to zoom in on what he's looking through the window. finally, we see... two florence county sheriff's cars with their lights flashing are parked in the parking lot of the cheap motel. jimmy zooms in on the cops as they get out of their cars.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{what are they doing?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{shhh.}
<A>__{the cops walk up to one of the doors to the motel room.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{four florence deputies stand outside the motel room door, ready to bust it in and raid the room.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{jimmy speaks in hushed tones so that others in the diner won't hear them.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{they're outside our room.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{oh god, jimmy! they know where we are. we're going to get caught!}
<A>__{florence deputy #1 knocks on the door, waits a beat, then busts it down. three florence deputies move in with their guns drawn.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy!}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(to self)}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{jimmy forgets to shut the camera down. he holds it by his waist as the two quickly struggle to get the hell out of the diner. follow along with them, camera by jimmy's side, mostly pointing randomly at the floor of the diner or out the window. they head out the door to the...}
<B>__{parking lot}
<A>__{action continues, the camera still rolling without jimmy realizing it. they run at a fast clip along the parking lot as they head toward... dinko's car}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{get in.}
<A>__{jimmy slides into the driver seat and throws the camera onto the dashboard. we see jimmy behind the wheel as they drive out of the parking lot. he's in freak out mode, afraid as hell they're going to be caught by the cops.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{they don't see us.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i know. just shut up! let me think.}
<A>__{jimmy keeps driving, his eyes darting back and forth between the road, the rear view mirror and judy.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{are they coming?}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i don't know. i don't think so.}
<A>__{jimmy looks back up into the rear view mirror, still not 100% satisfied that they're not being chased.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{no. i don't think they're coming.}
<A>__{jimmy's still not certain. he looks for a while. then he sighs. it seems that he knows they're not coming.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(relief)}
<D>__{oh, fuck.}
<P>__{(to judy)}
<D>__{that was close.}
<A>__{jimmy drives for a bit, then notices that the camera is on and pointing at him. he reaches forward and... camera shuts down.}
