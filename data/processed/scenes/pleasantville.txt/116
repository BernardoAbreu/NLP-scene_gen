<L>__{exterior main street. dusk.}
<A>__{betty is walking down main street with a shopping bag on either hand. from a block away, she looks like any other homemaker in pleasantville. you don't even notice the gray make up.}
<B>__{closer. following betty.}
<A>__{she nods to mrs. filmore in the bakery and smiles at don in the post office. betty is just about to turn on elm street when she glances up, and suddenly stops.}
<B>__{her pov. across the street.}
<A>__{there, in the middle of the block, sits mr. johnson's soda shop. the whole scene is still black and white, except for the large cubist painting that fills mr. johnson's window. it is rendered in bright pinks, yellows and oranges, and looks like a braque or a picasso except for the unusual subject matter. upon closer examination you see that all the spheres and cones add up to an avante garde snow scene, with a cubist santa hovering over the roof tops.}
<B>__{shot. betty.}
<A>__{she stares at it, mesmerized for a moment, then starts to wander across the street. it's late afternoon and the business district is empty. betty crosses in the middle of the block, staring straight ahead.}
