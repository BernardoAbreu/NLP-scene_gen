<C>__{norman}
<D>__{and whatever it is, it's not coming from harry.}
<A>__{norman looks at the monitors: on an outside camera feed a bright light blinds the screen. it's beth in the sub, moving along the habitat. the sub's claw arms carry large red boxes. the lettering on the boxes isn't in focus. norman squints at the monitor can't make it out.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{beth? what is that? what are you doing?}
<A>__{the sub's claw arms drops one of the boxes, plumping it softly on the muddy floor.}
