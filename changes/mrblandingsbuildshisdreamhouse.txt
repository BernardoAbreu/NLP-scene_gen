<DIAL>__{For fourteen years Jim and Muriel had been living in their apartment over on East Seventy-fourth Street. It was just another of those wonderful crisp September mornings and the Blandings were still asleep. Just like millions of other people in good old Manhattan -- New York City -- U.S.A.}
<ACTION>__{The CAMERA GOES THROUGH the window and INTO:}
<LOC>__{INT. THE BLANDINGS' BEDROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel (Myrna Loy) Blandings are asleep in twin beds. The room, not large to begin with, gives us the impression of being cluttered up and overcrowded because the beds, oversized chest of drawers, dressing table and chaise lounge take up an inordinate amount of space. SOUND of an alarm clock going off. Jim awakens, yawns himself into hazy consciousness, gropes about on the night table for the clock; it isn't there. He slips out of bed, and rubbing his eyes, blindly moves toward the dresser. The circuitous path, which he accomplishes with sleepy dexterity, entails going around the chaise lounge, just missing the ominously pointed edge of Muriel's dressing table, deftly stepping over the low dressing table chair and finally reaching the chest of drawers upon which is the clock. He turns off the alarm and yawningly starts back over the same path. We get the feeling that Jim makes this sleepy excursion every waking morning of his life. Back at his bed, Jim sits down, and, yawning loudly, gropes with his feet for his slippers. Before he can find them, however, he begins to doze off and slowly tilts back toward the pillow, pulling the covers over him. In a moment he is sound asleep. Muriel's arm automatically stretches out and shakes Jim into consciousness. As he painfully reawakens and starts to rise, Muriel's arm disappears. We get the impression that this, too, is a regular part of the Blandings' daily routine. Jim locates his slippers, reaches around for his bathrobe, can't find it, stumbles his way over to the closet, opens the door.}
<LOC>__{INT. THE CLOSET}
<ACTION>__{This is a fairly good-sized closet but it was never intended to be shared by two people, particularly not Jim and Muriel Blandings. Assuming that they had started out on even terms, it is now obviously Muriel, three-to-one. Her dresses, gowns, slips, seem to obscure his occasional pair of slacks, suit or sports coat. Her shoes neatly line the floor and the shelf above is loaded to the ceiling with her hat boxes, in an orderly but somewhat precarious state of balance. Groping blindly for a robe, Jim feels around and pulls one out. As he slips into the arms, we see it's much too small for him, obviously Muriel's. In disgust he attempts to put it back. Unable to find a hook he finally jams it in between two silk dresses which fall to the floor. As he bends down and gropes for the dresses, he discovers his robe crumpled under them on the floor. He drags the robe out and dons it, leaving the dresses where they fell. With a guilty look at Muriel he closes the closet door and starts out of the bedroom and into the narrow hall.}
<LOC>__{INT. THE HALL}
<ACTION>__{A narrow corridor extending the length of the apartment. Off it are doors leading to the bathroom, the childrens' room and the foyer. Jim shuffles down the hall. He stops at the closed bathroom door, listens, hears the shower, knocks.}

<LOC>__{INT. THE HALL}
<ACTION>__{Gingerly balancing the cup and saucer, Jim approaches the door to the children's room. With split-second timing, he pauses as the door flies open and Joan, in her bathrobe, towel in hand, rushes out and past him down the hall. She disappears into the bathroom. Jim carefully proceeds down the hall and, as he reaches the bathroom, deftly steps to the left as the door bursts open and Betsy flies by on the way back to her bedroom. All this is done with a timing and shifting of hips of which Knute Rockne might have been proud. Jim continues down the hall, enters the bedroom.}

<CHAR>__{JIM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, thanks a lot!}
<ACTION>__{He strides angrily to the closet, opens the door, reaches up for the basket and pulls it off the shelf. As he does so, all the hat boxes come tumbling down knocking the basket from his hand, the socks spilling on the floor. About to explode, he looks at Muriel.}

<ACTION>__{Jim looks at her barely containing himself, and then puts the hats back in the boxes, jams them back on the shelf where they toter precariously. With bated breath he gingerly closes the closet door. Pause. Silence. He picks up a pair of socks and walks cautiously toward the hall door. Suddenly there is a rumble and crash from inside the closet. Jim exchanges a look with Muriel, is about to say something, changes his mind, exits into the hall. Muriel looks at the closet, sighs, takes another sip of coffee.}
<LOC>__{INT. THE HALL}
<ACTION>__{Jim opens the door of the bathroom. There is a scream. He quickly closes the door, scowling with annoyance. A moment later the door opens and Joan emerges, wrapping her robe around her.}

<ACTION>__{Joan disappears into her room as Jim enters the bathroom.}
<LOC>__{INT. THE BATHROOM}
<ACTION>__{Very small with a stall shower. Jim takes off his bathrobe, yawns, gets on the scale, looks at the dial, shakes his head. He takes a deep breath, draws in his stomach, looks down, scowls, shrugs, gets off, moves to the mirror. He examines the thinness of his hair, the condition of his tongue, etc. Taking his toothbrush he looks down at the tube he is about to use, frowns. WHAT HE SEES - THE TOOTHPASTE TUBE WHAT HE SEES - the toothpaste tube. It has been squeezed in the middle, one of Blandings' pet peeves. CLOSE SHOT - JIM METICULOUSLY SMOOTHES OUT THE TUBE CLOSE SHOT - Jim meticulously smoothes out the tube, rolls up the used portion from the bottom. Then placing a small amount on his brush, he caps the tube, and starts vigorously to brush his teeth. As he does so, he attempts with his free hand, to put the tube back in the medicine cabinet which he opens. CLOSE SHOT - THE MEDICINE CABINET CLOSE SHOT - the medicine cabinet, loaded to the hilt with medical accumulation of fourteen years of family life. CLOSE SHOT - JIM CLOSE SHOT - Jim. As he pushes the tube into the bulging top shelf, a bottle of iodine falls out. Jim makes a desperate one-handed catch, still brushing his teeth. As he pushes the iodine into the second shelf, a small bottle of pills pops out. Jim catches it, pushes it back into the cabinet. A bottle of cough medicine falls out. He catches it, tries to put it back, finds it won't fit. He looks at the bottle, sniffs it, contemplates its value, throws it in the wastebasket. He finishes washing his mouth, admires his teeth, disrobes and steps into the shower, putting on his shower cap. He reacts, scowls, takes off the cap and turns it upside down, a full cup of water falling out. He reaches out for a towel, dries the inside of the cap, carefully puts it back on his now wet hair. Then he turns the water on and at the first warm spray Jim Blandings' life takes a sharp turn for the better. He starts to sing, a robust bathroom baritone version of "Home On The Range."}

<ACTION>__{Jim - He stands in front of the washstand lathering his face. Over scene we hear Muriel's voice from the shower. She is singing a lusty chorus of "Home On The Range." Jim picks up his razor and turns to the mirror. He reacts with annoyance, as he discovers it is covered with steam. With weary resignation he takes a towel and starts to rub off the mirror. As he clears one section another clouds up. By the time he gets it all reasonably clear he finds that his lather needs freshening. He grimly relathers his face only to find that the mirror is again clouded up. As he turns with exasperation toward the shower we see Muriel turn off the water, reach for a towel, start to dry herself. The mirror cleared off, Jim relathers, starts to shave. During this, Muriel, having dried herself and donned her robe, comes into scene.}

He opens the cabinet and gingerly places the tube on the top shelf. The iodine bottle pops out. He grimly catches it, studies his problem, has a solution. With his right hand he starts slowly to close the mirror door. Just before it closes, he slips the bottle into the cabinet with his left hand, quickly slamming the mirror door, trapping the bottle. He reacts masterfully at his triumph, picks up his robe and starts for the door. As he reaches it, there is the SOUND of the cabinet opening and a crash as the bottle obviously hits the washstand.

<DIAL>__{All I did was one day I saw four pieces of flagstone left over from the porch that were just going to be thrown away because nobody wanted them and I asked Mr. Retch if he wouldn't just put them down on the floor of the flower sink and poke a little cement between the cracks and give me a nice stone floor where it might be wet with flowers and things. That was absolutely all I did.}
<ACTION>__{During the above speech Simms sinks into a chair, puts his head in his hands and closes his eyes, a fact that isn't lost on Jim.}
<CHAR>__{JIM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's all you did?}

<CHAR>__{MURIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(verge of tears)}
<DIAL>__{Of course I didn't. All I said was I wanted a nice stone floor and Mr. Retch was just as nice as could be and said, "You're the doctor," and that's all anybody ever said to anybody about anything.}
<ACTION>__{Jim takes a deep breath, turns to Simms.}
<CHAR>__{JIM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{...Well?}
<CHAR>__{SIMMS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(sigh; plunging in)}
<DIAL>__{All right, I think I can tell you what happened. First, the carpenters had to rip up the flooring that was already laid. Those planks run under the whole width of the pantry, so Retch had to knock the bottom out of the pantry wall to get at them.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{JIM AND MURIEL}
<ACTION>__{Jim and Muriel - Jim looks at Muriel as though he were premeditating first-degree murder. She averts his gaze. Over this:}
<CHAR>__{SIMMS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then he had to chop out the tops of the joists under the flower sink space to make room for a cradle. I guess he bought some iron straps and fastened them to a big pan to give him something to hold the cement. What with that added load on the weakened joists, I'll bet he had to put a lally column down there for support, too.}
<CHAR>__{MURIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{SIMMS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, the main soil pipe runs under there on wall brackets, so Retch had to get his plumbing man back to take out a section so he could get that cradle set. I guess that meant he had to change the pitch of the soil pipe from one end of the house to the other.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(clearing his throat)}
<DIAL>__{And then, of course, there are hot and cold water pipes hooked to the joists right under that pantry. They go up to the wing bathroom on the second floor, and I'll bet my bottom dollar he had to relocate them.}

<CHAR>__{SIMMS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(preparing to exit)}
<DIAL>__{I'll admit it's a little steep. But I'll try to get Retch to knock a hundred dollars off the bill. If I can't get that, I'll certainly try for seventy-five.}

<DIAL>__{Fine.}
