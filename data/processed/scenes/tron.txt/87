<A>__{tron races out on it, ram and flynn behind. just as tron reaches the other side and ram has just started to cross, there's a tremendous explosion of electronic flak, blasting ram and tossing him back on top of flynn. both cycles de rez. the bridge disappears, and a mass of rubble falls, partially obscuring ram and flynn. tron screeches to a halt and swings his bike back around. he looks around ram and flynn are nowhere in sight. in the ravine below, he sees a pile of motionless rubble. the tank fires again, narrowly missing tron, and he revs up again, speeds off down the ramp, and is gone.}
