<L>__{interior dussander's living room day}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{it was incredible.}
<A>__{dussander stares back at him flatly.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{all of this... because of a rain coat?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{well, it wasn't that easy. i mean, i had to really check up on it. and every picture of you in those books is forty years old, at least. i went back to the library to find the picture. and then i matched it with the photos i took.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you took photographs of me?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yeah, i got this little camera. fits right in the palm of my hand.}
<C>__{dussander}
<P>__{(crunches cigarette into ashtray)}
<D>__{clever boy.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{but even then i couldn't be sure. i needed real proof. so i went to the mall and bought a fingerprint kit from the hobby shop and a book that tells you what you're supposed to look for and then dusted your mailbox while you were at the movies. pretty smart, huh?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you... put dust on my mailbox? for fingerprints? you took photographs of me? what else did you do?... i don't believe any of this.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i already had a copy of your fingerprints. they're on your want sheet from the israeli government. it's on database at uc irvine. can you believe that?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{bourbon.}
<A>__{he storms toward the kitchen and stops.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{would you care for a drink, boy?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{sure, you got a coke?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{no kok.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{milk?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{milk.}
<A>__{dussander disappears into the kitchen. todd stands alone in the living room. he lets out a long, nervous breath, showing for the first time the presence of something other than the cold confidence he has been putting up for dussander. he knows he has crossed into dangerous territory from which there is no going back. but after a moment he composes himself; he has come this far. the sternness returns to his eyes. todd is all business. he takes a breath, and then speaks loudly enough for dussander to hear him in the kitchen.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{it takes eight good matches, they're called compares, actually, for a fingerprint to get accepted in court.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{is that right?}
<A>__{flashback: exterior dussander's front porch day todd steps up onto the porch and looks around calmly. he pulls the powder and brush from his pocket and begins to examine the mailbox for prints.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{yeah, there were two sets of prints. the first i figured were the mailman's. once i knew what i was looking for, yours were easy to spot.}
