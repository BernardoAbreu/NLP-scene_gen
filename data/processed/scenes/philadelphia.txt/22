<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{miguel shoves through glass doors, into the bustling emergency room (interior day), finding andrew sitting on a gurney, holding a cotton ball against his arm, where blood has been drawn, wearing a blanket over his shoulders, fighting chills. chandra and bruno are waiting with andrew. they exchange quick hugs with miguel and andrew, ad libbing greetings and goodbyes.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{thanks, you guys.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{yeah. thanks, guys.}
<A>__{miguel puts his arms around andrew.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{gillman's out of her office today. i told her to take a day off, and she did, can you believe it? did you get someone to cover your class?}
<A>__{miguel touches andrew's face, checking for fever.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{don't worry about it. they took blood? a specimen?}
<A>__{andrew holds an empty specimen cup.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{aren't you giving an exam?}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{i said, don't worry about it.}
<A>__{miguel places a gentle kiss on andrew's sweaty forehead.}
<C>__{miguel }
<D>__{you got a fever, baby.}
<A>__{suddenly, the facade cracks and tears sting andrew's eyes.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{i almost didn't make it to the bathroom, miguel. i almost lost control right in front of everybody.}
<C>__{miguel}
<P>__{(holding him)}
<D>__{so what? it's nothing to be ashamed of. you have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?}
<A>__{andrew pulls himself together, brushing aside tears, in control of his emotions once more.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{wait, here's my guy... hey!}
<A>__{andrew catches the attention of a harried intern, whose surgeon's greens are covered with blood.}
<C>__{intern}
<D>__{mr. beckett, i'm sorry...}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{about my blood work?}
<C>__{intern}
<D>__{we're waiting...}
<A>__{miguel opens a small notebook, making notes.}
<C>__{intern}
<D>__{... meanwhile, i'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{sounds delightful.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{why do you need to do this?}
<C>__{intern}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{who are you? doctor... ?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{this is my partner. we keep records of hospital visits. nothing personal.}
<C>__{intern}
<D>__{dr. klenstein.}
<P>__{(to andrew)}
<D>__{it's not a pleasant procedure, but if the ks is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{it could be parasites, an infection...}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{a reaction to azt...}
<C>__{klenstein}
<D>__{that's possible, but.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{he's not going through some painful procedure until we've cancelled out everything else.}
<C>__{intern}
<D>__{i'm trying to help your "partner." you're not a member of his immediate family, i could have you removed from the er.}
<C>__{andrew}
<P>__{(to the intern)}
<D>__{he's upset, he's sorry.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{don't apologize for me.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{he's not sorry, okay, fine.}
<P>__{(the diplomat)}
<D>__{why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? i will work on getting a specimen, i'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. okay? everybody happy?}
<C>__{intern}
<D>__{allright. i will get on the lab about the blood work.}
<C>__{miguel}
<P>__{(to the intern)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{the intern walks away. andrew's beeper beeps.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{that's the third time. i better call the office.}
<P>__{(smiling at niguel)}
<D>__{would you relax, please?}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{i am relaxed.}
<A>__{andrew hobbles toward a pay phone, outside a visitor lounge, where weary relatives are watching tv. andrew drops a quarter into the phone.}
<C>__{joe miller's voice}
<D>__{"if you or someone you know..."}
<A>__{andrew's pov on television: joe miller on the screen, with the words "negligence... malpractice... auto accidents"... and in the background, photos of maimed, burned, injured clients.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{"... has been injured through the fault of others, you may be entitled to legal remedy...}
<A>__{andrew laughs. then, his call is answered:}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{shelby? it's me. jamey's been beeping me, i... okay, okay, calm down. put jamey on.}
