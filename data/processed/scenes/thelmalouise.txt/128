<C>__{louise}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{thelma marches off to the store. louise puts a tape in the deck and is listening to loud r&b music. she checks herself in the rearview mirror. she takes her lipstick out and is about to put it on. she makes eye contact with herself and, instead, throws it out the window, closes her eyes and leans her head back on the seat. she's in a world of shit. thelma comes trotting out of the store and jumps into the car.}
