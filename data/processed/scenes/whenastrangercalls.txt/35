<L>__{interior dr. monk's office day}
<A>__{clifford is looking through the folder again.}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{ordinary street clothes. not all of our patients have to wear the green gucci gowns.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{did he have any money with him?}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{probably. but not more than, say, fifty dollars. some of the patients are given little jobs around the ward, for which they are paid. it's part of the rehabilitation.}
<A>__{looking down, clifford pauses over a page in the folder. closeup fact sheet in folder a page of legibly organized facts and statistics about curt duncan. one of the entries reads: guy du marraux.}
<C>__{clifford }
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{what's guy du mar }
<C>__{dr. monk }
<P>__{(pronouncing it correctly)}
<D>__{guy du marraux syndrom.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{it's a psycho motor dysfunction.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{duncan had it?}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{only from time to time, which is unusual.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{it attacks the nervous system. people suffering from it are irresistibly compelled to utter obscenities, sometimes one, sometimes a whole string of them. they can't control it.}
<C>__{clifford}
<P>__{(somewhat taken aback)}
<D>__{are you being serious?}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{yeah. here, i will give you an example.}
<A>__{he opens a file cabinet drawer, finds a reel of quarter inch magnetic tape and starts to thread it through a recorder on his desk.}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{duncan never had the twitch that sometimes goes with it. and with duncan, as i said, the disease would only manifest itself in periods of extreme anxiety. when he was really flipping out, in other words.}
<A>__{there is a pause as monk fiddles with the tape recorder and clifford looks back down at the folder.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{duncan was catholic?}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so am i.}
<C>__{clifford}
<P>__{(mildly surprised)}
<D>__{that makes three of us.}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{is that right? so we all share the same guilt.}
<A>__{clifford smiles. monk keeps fiddling.}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{here. this is curt duncan shortly after he was admitted here in 1972.}
<A>__{monk turns on the tape recorder as clifford sits forward in his chair to listen. at first, nothing can be heard. then there is a click as if the machine was turned on in the middle of a conversation:}
<C>__{dr. monk }
<D>__{ to put the situation right. the hypodermic needles are only used to give you medication that will calm you down. they make you feel good, relaxed. all right?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{we're not putting anything in your food either. the food is just food.}
<C>__{duncan }
<P>__{(extremely agitated)}
<D>__{no. i don't eat the food. it doesn't taste right.}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<P>__{(to clifford)}
<D>__{that's duncan.}
<A>__{clifford nods and keeps listening:}
<C>__{dr. monk }
<D>__{curt, why are you fidgeting? can't you get comfortable?}
<C>__{duncan }
<D>__{no, i'm not comfortable!}
<C>__{dr. monk }
<D>__{wait a hey!}
<P>__{(to someone else)}
<D>__{hold him down there. grab him! never mind the chair!}
<A>__{there are scuffling noises underneath which can be heard, heavy breathing and then, getting louder and more furious, duncan falling into the throes of guy du marraux.}
<C>__{dr. monk }
<P>__{(periodically interjecting)}
<D>__{pull him down... that's right... just lay him out... lay him right out... steady... pull out his knees...}
<A>__{finally monk is heard no more and duncan continues with the frightening verbal torrent of guy du marraux.}
