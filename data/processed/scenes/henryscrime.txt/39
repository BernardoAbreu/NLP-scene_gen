<L>__{exterior field day}
<A>__{a grass field. it's raining. henry steps into frame with a shovel. behind him an older man in a cap pushes a wheelbarrow. in the ditch later from a low angle we watch as henry digs. he's a few feet down. the wheelbarrowman still watches silently.}
<L>__{interior apartment night}
<A>__{henry lies on his bed, staring up at the ceiling. his mind turns. he's starting to think...o.s. the sound of the `buffalotto' jingle on the tv.}
