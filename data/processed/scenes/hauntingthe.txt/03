<L>__{interior living room, nell's apartment day}
<A>__{ becoming a fight. jane, 30s, dark haired, furious, wheels across a diminutive, neat, but poor living room.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{it'll take a month to probate the will, nell! a month! even if mother left you something, you won't get it in time to pay the rent. so instead of complaining, you should be thanking lou for getting you these two weeks to get mother's things packed.}
<A>__{at first we can't even see who she's yelling at. at first we don't even notice her. then we do... holding herself, in a dim corner away from the light, small, plain, like a part of the faded room is eleanor vance, 20's nell. she stares at the door. the clothes line raps at the begrimed glass.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{nell?}
<A>__{the wind dies, the banging stops. nell seems to hear jane and peers over at her, then across the room to jane's bored husband, lou. he's turning a franklin mint commemorative coin set in his hands, studying it.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{you're still going to have to settle with your mother's landlord on the back rent.}
<A>__{nell watches jane's little boy, richie. unpacified by the cartoons on the tv, he plows a plastic tank across a shelf through neat rows of delicate porcelain dolls.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i'm not going to stay. i will get a job. i will get my own apartment.}
<A>__{richie knocks a porcelain doll off, and it breaks all over the carpet. his parents don't notice. but nell feels it in the soul. richie stops. a long beat. he looks at her, insolent, then plows on with his tank.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{nell. a job? two months and where is this job? you have no degree, you've never worked }
<A>__{nell explodes in outraged fury, startling us.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{ i've never worked? }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you have no experience in the world... the regular world. what would you put on a resume?}
<P>__{(beat, softening)}
<D>__{now we all appreciate what you did for mother. isn't that right, lou?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{eleven years. long time.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{that's why we've been talking. with me getting more time in accessories, and lou at the shop all day, we need somebody to take care of richie, do a little cleaning and cooking. and in return you can have the extra room.}
<A>__{she goes to lou, puts a hand on his shoulder, proud of her generosity. all nell can do is stare. and then: knock knock. like a shot nell is out of the chair and turning for a set of french doors across the room. it's all reflex. nell catches herself. knock knock. richie, lying on the couch like he's sick, raps on the wall with a wooden cane and squeals:}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{eleanor, help me! i've got to pee!}
<A>__{nell reacts, but rather than being amused or annoyed, a wave of trauma flickers over her face. the reaction is so strong we instantly know something is very wrong.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{richie, knock it off before i beat the crap out of you!}
<A>__{nell turns away, sick, breathing hard. jane picks up a jewelry box from a dresser.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you're sure this is all of mother's jewelry? the lawyer said to make sure we took it to him...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he said there might be some antique pieces. have you seen anything? some of it might be valuable.}
<A>__{nell knows what is going to happen to that jewelry. jane no longer can bear the weight of nell's stare, checks her watch. she nods at lou. lou rises, pocketing the coin set. richie follows him out.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{think about our offer, nell. you don't know how hard it is out there.}
