<A>__{kylie is still alone in the luv truck. the windows are clear; the parasites have abandoned their quest, just as they did with the posse in the barn. but kylie stays in the car, trembling, afraid to leave. she hears a door open. she sees her parents and her sisters come stumbling out the front door of her home. they're also bloated and diseased. their chins and shirts are stained with the blood they spit up.}
<C>__{kylie's dad}
<D>__{kylie, honey, you okay? come on out.}

<A>__{her dad leans over and picks up a large rock. he carries it toward the truck. he holds it up over the windshield. kylie screams as he smashes it down. the windshield cracks, but doesn't shatter. he holds it up again.}
