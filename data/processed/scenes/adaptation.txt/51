<A>__{laroche drives, solemnly nodding his head. orlean studies him for a moment, her sad eyes wet and glistening.}
<C>__{orlean}
<D>__{wow, that's some story. so how many turtles did you end up collecting?}
<C>__{laroche}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{oh, i lost interest right after that.}
<C>__{orlean}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{laroche}
<D>__{i dropped turtles when i fell in love with ice age fossils. learned everything about them. collected the shit out of 'em. fossils were the only thing made any sense to me in this fucking world. y'know?}
<A>__{they drive in silence. orlean watches a flying heron.}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{then fossils were over when i found lapidary, which i just adored.}
<C>__{orlean}
<D>__{okay, now what is lap }
<C>__{laroche}

<C>__{orlean}
<D>__{so, did you ever miss the turtles? the only thing that made you ten year old life worth living?}

<D>__{i will tell you a story. i once fell deeply, profoundly in love with tropical fish. i had sixty goddamn fish tanks in my house. i'd skin dive to find just the right ones. anisotremus virginicus, holacanthus ciliaris, chaetodon capistratus. you name it. then one day i say, fuck fish. i renounce fish.}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{i vow to never set foot in the ocean again, that's how much fuck fish. that was seventeen years ago and i have never since stuck so much as a toe into that ocean. and i love the ocean!}
