<L>__{exterior san francisco streets midway down hill #3 day}
<A>__{the humvee and ferrari blast down the hill. the street is thick with vehicular traffic. so the humvee swerves, leaving the street. onto the sidewalk. where... snap snap snap it knocks down every parking meter, then hits a ladder in a cordoned off area. on the ladder, a lineman is fixing a municipal power line. the ladder collapses; the lineman falls, flailing through the air. goodspeed slams on the brakes. the ferrari spins 180 degrees and lurches to a stop facing uphill.}
