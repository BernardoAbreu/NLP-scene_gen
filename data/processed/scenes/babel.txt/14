<D>__{once there was a hawk who wanted to fly higher than everyone else. he trained every day and hunted little birds so he could eat them and be strong.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{pajaritos? little birds?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{of course, that's what hawks eat. so, one day the hawk flew so, so high that it crashed into an airplane. it fainted and started to fall. and when it was about to hit the ground, all the birds flew toward him and saved him.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{they saved him?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{yes, and when the hawk was healthy again he went to talk to the birds and said: i want to thank you for saving me, but i can't change and i'm going to keep hunting you. the little birds answered: we don't care that you hunt us, because that's who you are. but we will always save you, because that's who we are.}

<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{go to sleep. i will sit here with you, but you can't talk anymore. they both nod and snuggle under their blankets. amelia watches them silently.}
