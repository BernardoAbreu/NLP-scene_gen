<L>__{exterior alta loma terrace day}
<A>__{carson stops at the entrance to the winding, hillside neighborhood, accessible only by footpaths. the area is covered by thick foliage, hiding javal from the helicopter. carson revs down so he can listen for javal's machine. he hears it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{javal has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. he can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique, outdoor elevator, housed in a free standing, three story concrete tower. he jumps off his bike. carrying the saddlebags, he runs into the elevator but it needs a key to operate. javal comes back out, panicking. he hears carson coming up the hill. he spots a gardener watering nearby with a hose.}
<B>__{angle with carson}
<A>__{as he reaches the summit. he sees javal's motorcycle, abandoned, lying on its side... and then he sees the gardener, sprawled on the ground, a bullet hole in the center of his forehead. carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his sig 9mm. he moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the casement window in the back of the tower is broken. one end of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is hanging through the broken window. carson looks out the window as javal climbs down the outside of the tower on the hose to high tower drive, the street below.}
