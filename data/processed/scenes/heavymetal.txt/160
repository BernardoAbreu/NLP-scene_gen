<A>__{the archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread driven shovel sifter up to the spot. the shovel sifter digs in and pulls up a large chunk of desert. when the sand has sifted out, we see the tarnished loc nar in the machine's grip. it is not glowing. the machine swivels, and a native foreman plucks the loc nar from the shovel sifter's teeth. as the foreman touches it, the loc nar starts glowing brightly. the foreman's hands turn green. he looks at his green hands, then he looks over to the archaeologist. suddenly the foreman's entire body glows green, and crumbles into dust. the archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the glowing loc nar, lying in the pile of green dust.}
