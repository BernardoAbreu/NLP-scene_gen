<A>__{back with dr. reinghold. he's laughing.}
<C>__{dr. reinghold}
<D>__{it's a funny situation actually. if anyone besides mickey and mallory give a damn, what the prison board is doing would be considered an outrage. the prison board is basically saying, 'we can't handle these guys.' they've moved 'em around twice since their sentence started. they were a handful everywhere they went. now the prisons they're at now want them outta there. but no other prison's gonna be stupid enough to take 'em. so the prison board is left scratching their heads wondering what they're gonna do. well, what they decided to do was to set up a kangaroo medical court that found them crazy. then they get them transferred to nystrom medical asylum or lobotomy bay as it's referred to in the psychiatric circle. put 'em on a strict dope and electro shock diet, and mickey and mallory cease to be a problem to anybody except the orderlies who clean out the bedpans, which if you want to see them get theirs, that's all well and good. but there's something being said here. forget the immorality for a second. forget the corruption and the skulduggery involved. what the board is saying is 'we give up.' mickey and mallory ran amuck in polite society. they were put in an alternative society and they ran amuck there, too. all the powers that be, can't deal with these two kids. and whatever can't be assimilated has to be terminated.}

<D>__{so, in your opinion mickey and mallory are not insane?}
<C>__{dr. reinghold}
<D>__{insane, no. psychotic, yes. a menace to living creatures, yes. but to suggest that they're insane gives the impression that they don't know right from wrong. mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong. they just don't give a damn.}
