<A>__{szpilman opens cupboards, drawers, searching, but trying to be as quiet as possible. he sees the refrigerator, quickly gets to it, pulls open the door. empty. he looks around and notices a red fire bucket with a spade and a box of sand next to it. the bucket is full of water, covered with an iridescent film and full of dead flies. he drinks as much water as he can without swallowing the flies and, while he's doing so, he spots a couple of sacks. he opens the first: potatoes. the second contains barley. he tries to eat the uncooked barley but can't. later: a fire on the floor. szpilman holds a saucepan over it and is cooking the barley and some potatoes. he manages to scoop out a spoonful, blows to cool it, then eats.}
