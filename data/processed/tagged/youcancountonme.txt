<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i mean they didn't tell us what it's supposed to be about. they said do whatever you want.}

<D>__{oh no, really?}
<A>__{mabel nods and passes by. sammy knocks on a big door that says "manager" and has half the letters of the previous branch manager's name taken off it.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(inside)}
<D>__{yeah, come in!}
<A>__{sammy swings open the door. brian everett, the new branch manager, is unpacking a box. sammy is surprised to see he is in his early thirties and very good looking in a boyish sort of way; he wears shirt sleeves and tie, and a wedding ring.}

<D>__{mr. everett?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{yeah: brian.}
<C>__{sammy}

<D>__{yeah, hi, how are you? come on in. sit down.}
<A>__{sammy comes into the office and sits.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i am so sorry i was late...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{yeah, we missed you before...}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i got held up. believe me, it is not something i make a habit of...}

<L>__{interior brian's office. later}
<A>__{sammy sits in front of brian's desk. brian is behind the desk listening.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{ so i always just run out at 3:15 to pick him up and then run him real quick over to the sitter's house. anyway, larry never minded about it and i was just hoping it would be ok with you too...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{well samantha i realize that scottsville is not exactly a major banking center...}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{no it's not...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{no i know it's not... but it's kind of a personal challenge to me to see what we can do to bring local service up to the same kinds of standards we'd be trying to meet if we were the biggest branch in the state. and that means i don't want anybody running out at 3:15 or 3:30, or whenever the bus happens to come in that day. now is there anybody else who can pick your son up after school? does your husband work in the area? do you }
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{oh no rudy sr. isn't "on the scene." so to speak.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{well, i can give you a couple of days to make some other arrangement, but...}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{well brian? i understand what you're saying, and i think it's great. i do. because there's a lot of things around here that could use some attention. believe me. but i've honestly been meeting that bus every day for four years now and it really does take just fifteen minutes, and if i take the time out of my lunch hour...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i'd really prefer it if you would make some other arrangement. ok?}
<C>__{sammy}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{i will do my best...!}
<A>__{brian kicks back in his chair and puts his hands behind his head.}

<A>__{sammy comes into the house carrying two bags of groceries. rudy follows, looking through the mail. sammy passes through the house and goes into the kitchen.}

<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{her whole face lights up and she grabs the letter. she tears it open and reads it with growing excitement.}
<L>__{interior sammy's bedroom. later}
<A>__{sammy opens her file drawer. inside are tax files, household files, miscellaneous files. she puts terry's letter away in a very full file marked "terry correspondence." the folder is stuffed with other letters, on all different kinds of stationery from all over the country, all from terry.}

<D>__{whose room is he gonna stay in?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{he can stay in the little room.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but you know what? he's not going to live here. he's only gonna stay for a little while... and it's ok if you don't remember him, because you were only six the last time he was here... but it'll be nice if you got a chance to get to know each other a little bit. don't you think?}
<A>__{rudy looks worried and doesn't answer.}
<L>__{interior living room. later}
<A>__{rudy is on the floor, writing in his school composition notebook. sammy comes downstairs.}
<C>__{sammy}

<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she puts on a cd, sits down and picks up a book. she looks at rudy, who is writing away.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{did you think of a story?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{what's it about?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{my father.}

<D>__{what about your father?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{it's just a made up story about him.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{can i read it when you're done?}

<A>__{sammy and bob steegerson are eating dinner at dawson's, the only fancy restaurant in town. bob is in his mid thirties, a realtor, a decent, ordinary guy.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{anyway, bob, it's sort of this adventure story, and rudy's father is this secret agent or something, working for the government... and it just made me feel weird. you know? because i never really say much to him about rudy sr., because i don't know what to say. and i don't know whether i should just let him imagine whatever he wants to imagine, or whether i should sit him down sometime and tell him, you know, that his father is not such a nice person. you know?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{well... i don't know, sammy. what have you told him already?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{not much. he knows i don't have the highest opinion of him. and he knows i don't want to see him or know anything about him, ever. but i tried to keep it kind of neutral. anyway... i could go into a lot more detail, believe me.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{well... it's an interesting problem. but i don't really know what to tell you... it's a little outside my personal field of expertise...}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i'd be glad to give it some thought...}

<D>__{really?}

<D>__{yeah... i've got the baby sitter... but... thanks for a lovely evening.}

<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i've actually got to confess to you, sammy... that the reason you may not have heard from me for a little while is that i've been kind of unable to write... on account of the fact that i was in jail for a little while.}

<D>__{ok can you please stop cursing at me?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i mean, i realize i'm in no position to, uh, basically say anything, ever but it's not like i'm down there in some redneck bar in florida having an argument with some stripper's boyfriend and i suddenly think, "hey! maybe this'd be a good time to really stick it to sammy and get myself locked up for a few months."}

<C>__{terry}
<D>__{yes. yes.}

<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{what is happening here?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{it's just the problem is that the pipe is corroded all the way along the length of the hall. so every time i put in a new piece it starts leaking further down.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{why don't i just call the plumber?}
<C>__{terry}

<D>__{well, we're not allowed to watch any more tv, so it's this or nothing... but if we run into any trouble, let me do the talking.}

<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{terry swings the door open.}
<L>__{interior the wild moose. night}
<A>__{pov rudy: a lot of men and women at the bar or in booths, eating and drinking. smoky, crowded and very loud. as he follows terry through the crowd various patrons notice him some of the looks are friendly, some blank, some cold, i.e., what's a kid doing in here? at the pool table: terry and rudy stand side by side facing the players and waiting players gathered around the table. terry waves a few bills.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i got a hundred bucks here says me and my nephew can beat anybody in here. only we gotta get the next game 'cause he's gotta be in bed by ten o'clock.}
<A>__{a moment later: rudy, very nervous, and the 1st pool player are side by side shooting for break. terry is behind rudy coaching him.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{just hit it nice and soft... nice and soft.}
<A>__{they hit the balls. rudy just clips his ball and it doesn't go anywhere. 1st pool player's ball hits the opposite bank and comes almost all the way back.}
<C>__{rudy}
<P>__{(to terry)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{god damn, rudy. i thought you said you could play.}
<A>__{rudy doesn't answer. terry winks at him. a moment later: 1st pool player breaks whack! the balls scatter. nothing drops. terry steps up to the table, chalking up his cue.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{boys, it's all over but the cryin'.}

<C>__{bob}
<D>__{ok... fair enough.}
<L>__{interior wild moose. night}
<A>__{terry has sunk everything but the eight ball. he leans over to sink it. it's a fairly easy shot. he lines it up carefully, and deliberately shoots it so it stops two inches from the corner pocket.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{ohhhh!}
<A>__{a few moments later: terry and rudy sit side by side watching as the 2nd pool player passes back and forth between them and the camera, running the table. "oohs" and "all rights" emit from the spectators. sudden silence. then the clack of the balls connecting. a great common groan goes up. rudy looks up at terry.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{it's all yours, baby.}
<A>__{rudy looks at the table: the eight ball is two inches off the corner. the cue ball is a few inches away from it. a piece of cake, for an adult. rudy looks deeply unconfident. he gets up and tries to line up the eight ball. terry is right next to him.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{just make sure to hit it really gentle. but firm. and hit it a little low so you get some backspin. don't even hit it. just kiss it.}
<A>__{a long moment.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{what do you mean, kiss it?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i mean tap it. firm but very, very softly. and don't shoot until you know it's going in. ok?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{everyone is relatively quiet. rudy takes a few practice strokes and then hits the cue ball, straight, but too softly. it crawls toward the eight and taps it toward the corner, slower and slower, hangs there, and drops. a general "heyyy!" goes up and everyone claps and cheers. terry grabs rudy. rudy smiles, ecstatic.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{that was great!}
<A>__{at the bar: darryl the sheriff, in his civvies, drinking a pint of beer, notices rudy and terry. at the pool table: terry picks rudy up and turns him upside down. rudy laughs.}

<A>__{they hear bob's car doors slam. terry makes a comic panicked face and leaps up the stairs two at a time. outside the house: sammy waves to bob. bob waves back as he drives off. sammy goes to the front door, opens it: terry and rudy are in a giggly tangled panicked heap at the top of the stairs, shaking rudy's arm and sleeve, frantically trying to get the jacket off. sammy comes in. they freeze.}

<A>__{sammy straightens up.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{oh really? what's his problem?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{his problem is that he's like totally sheltered because you treat him like he's three, instead of eight, so that's how he behaves.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{oh yeah? and how do you think he should behave?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i think he shouldn't have to run and tell his mommy every time he does something she might not like, for one thing.}

<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{first of all, he didn't tell me anything: darryl did. ok? second of all, i don't really give a shit if you took him to play pool: i was mad at you because you left him standing at the bus stop in the rain. but no, i don't want you telling him not to squeal, because i don't want him put in that position!}

<D>__{please don't go till you know where you're going. please...!}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i do know where i'm going. i'm going to worcester and i'm gonna try to see that girl. and then depending on what happens there, i thought i'd try to see if there's any work for me out west. and if there is, i'm gonna head out there for the summer and try to make some money. and if there isn't, i will figure something else out. maybe i will stay around the east. i don't know... i really liked it in alaska. it was really beautiful. you just it made me feel good. and before things got so messed up i was doin' pretty well out there. seriously. but i couldn't stay here long, sammy: i don't want to live here. but i'm gonna stay in touch. and i will be back. 'cause i want to see you and i want to see rudy. i will come home for christmas. how about that? we'll have christmas together.}

<A>__{she looks at him.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{hey, sammy... remember when we were kids, remember what we always used to say to each other . . .?}

<A>__{she throws her arms around his neck. he pats her gently.}
<L>__{interior exterior bus. day}
<A>__{the doors open and terry comes up the steps and into the bus. outside, sammy watches him pay the driver and move through the bus toward his seat. the bus doors close.}
<L>__{exterior bus. continuous}
<A>__{sammy waves till the bus drives all the way down main street, turns a corner and is gone.}
<L>__{interior bus. continuous}
<A>__{terry, in his seat, turns forward and watches the view go by. he smiles a little.}
<L>__{interior sammy's car (moving). day}
<A>__{the morning sunlight flickers through the windshield into the car as sammy drives along toward work. she passes the town hall clock and sees that it's 9:20. she dries her damp cheek with a forearm and rolls down her window to let the morning breeze blow through. squaring her shoulders a little, she drives through town at a slow and easy pace.}
