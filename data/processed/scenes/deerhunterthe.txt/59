<L>__{exterior roadside area dawn later}
<A>__{shots are ringing out in the hills. nick, albert and john stand by the roadside while vince and merle glare at each other. vince is still in his tuxedo pants, is still wearing his dress shoes and is draped in a gigantic red goose down vest that could only have come from albert. merle's knapsack lies on the ground in front of him and we can see that it contains a pair of vibram soled mountain boots.}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{sure i got boots. i got boots right here.}

<C>__{vince}
<D>__{you're one fuckin' bastard, merle. you know that? you're one fucking bastard!}
<C>__{merle}

<D>__{this is this, vince. this isn't something else. this is this!}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{you know what i think? there's times i think you're a goddamn faggot!... i fixed you up a million times, merle!}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{i fixed him up a million times! i don't know how many times i fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... zilch! zero!... the trouble with you, merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "this is this"? what does that mean, "this is this"? i mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! and if it isn't, what the hell is it???}

<D>__{get the boots.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(crossing to merle's knapsack)}
<D>__{i mean let's get going before }
<A>__{merle who has remained completely calm throughout vince's tirade pumps a shell in the chamber of his rifle. john freezes in his tracks and stares at him, his face gone white.}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{i said no.}
<A>__{john looks at albert, who is right behind him, and they both back away. vince, who is standing directly opposite merle, begins to tremble. his mouth comes open, closes and comes open again. urine begins trickling out from the bottom of his pants leg, staining the snow. suddenly, nick steps forward. he looks at merle, crosses to the knapsack, takes out the boots, walks over to vince and throws them on the road.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(gently, to merle)}
<D>__{let's hunt.}
