<D>__{harry, i gotta go...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{erica, she's just a friend.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah, she looks like a buddy kind of a girl.}
<A>__{erica reaches a corner, can't get across, turns the corner. harry arrives next to her.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{come on, it's just a dinner...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{look, harry, here's the problem. i really like you.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i really like you.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah, but i love you like you.}
<P>__{(that stops him)}
<D>__{i do. i love you.}
<A>__{harry swoons and not in a good way.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i think maybe you should consider that you're in love with the idea of being in love.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{do you? okay. oh, god...}
<P>__{(stomps her feet)}
<D>__{i'm like the dumb girl who doesn't get it.}
<P>__{(tries not to cry in front of him)}
<D>__{i've never been the dumb girl before. it ain't so great.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{let's just calm down. this was just a a meal with a friend.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{ did you know i called you seven hours ago?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i was gonna call you. i've been jamming all day, it's my first day back.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{uh huh. . .}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i had these plans before i met you. but i do like seeing you. i do. i'm always surprised by it.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{what was i thinking?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{maybe you weren't thinking for once and look what a good time we had. let's not ruin something great.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{harry, i won't be good at this.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{at what?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{acting like i don't care.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i have never lied to you. i have always told you some version of the truth.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(freaking on that one)}
<D>__{the truth doesn't have versions.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{can you cut me a little slack? my life's been turned upside down.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah. mine too.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{then let's each get our bearings.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i don't want my bearings. i've had my bearings my whole fucking life. i felt something with you that... oh, you don't want to }
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yes i do.}
<P>__{(she won't open up)}
<D>__{tell me.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i felt something with you, i didn't know really existed. you know what that's like after a twenty year marriage? to feel something for another person that's so off the charts, that }
<P>__{(harry looks down)}
<D>__{okay, not your problem. this is why i'm not good in relationships. you know writers are like teachers, those who can do, those who can't write romantic comedies where this does not happen in the third act...and it certainly does not happen to a 55 year old woman. in the play i will be 36 so it won't be as pathetic. i'm just too old to feel crushed.i've written this feeling but i never really got it.}
<P>__{(realizes)}
<D>__{you know what this is?}
<P>__{(pointing to herself)}
<D>__{this is heart broken. how's that for impervious?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you're killin' me.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i just wish it had lasted more than a week.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{me too.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{that's a horrible thing to say.}
<P>__{(walks off, comes back)}
<D>__{the life i had before i met you. i knew how to do that, could do that forever. now look at me...what do i do with all this?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{can we talk tomorrow?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{what for? i saw your friend you were having dinner with, if that's what you want, it's never going to work with me. look at me. i'm a middle aged woman, don't let this brown hair fool you, i don't have a real brown hair on my head, i'm almost all grey...that would freak you out, wouldn't it? and i have. high cholesterol and my back hurts every morning and i'm post menopausal and i have osteoperosis and i'm sure arthritis is just around the corner and i know you've seen my vericose veins. let's face it man, that's not quite the buzz you're lookin' for.}
<A>__{a taxi pulls up.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{and you know what? everyday, i'm gettin' older. ..just like you.}
<A>__{erica opens the back door of the taxi.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{wait.}
<A>__{erica turns. this is his chance.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i just... the truth is... i don't know how to be a boyfriend.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{that's what you have to say after all this? you don't know how to be a boyfriend.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's not a small thing.}
<A>__{they're both out of words.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{are we done?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{she nods. he doesn't give. she ducks into the cab and it pulls away. harry stands on the street, watching her go.}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you can't. i took viagra.}
<C>__{dr. martiinez}
<D>__{you have been through this before. give him 5 mgs of metoprolol. you h ving chest pain right now?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, and the pain i was having was sharp, not like before.}
<C>__{dr. martinez}
<D>__{that's good. not like before is we like to hear.}

<C>__{dr. martinez}
<D>__{are you kidding? love hurts, haven't you heard?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, but so far, i've only given pain, i never got any.}
<C>__{dr. martinez}
<P>__{(confused at how literal he is)}
<D>__{all right, well you're battin' a thousand here. your enzymes look perfect, your ekg is normal and the pain doesn't sound like the kind of pain we worry about. i think what you experienced was normal chest pain associated with stress.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{stress?}
<C>__{dr. martinez}
<D>__{and incase you haven't heard, that can give you a heart attack. mr. langer, i donlt know what you're up to gallivanting out and about at this hour, but if you were my dad, i'd make sure you were home, in bed, recuperating.}
