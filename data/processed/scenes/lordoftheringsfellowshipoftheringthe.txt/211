<A>__{close on: an old sword sliding out of a shabby leather scabbard...its polished, well tendered blade glitters cold and bright.}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{my old sword "sting"...here, take it!}
<A>__{bilbo offers sting to frodo.}
<C>__{frodo}
<D>__{it's so light!}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{yes, yes, made by the elves, you know. the blade glows blue when orcs are close...and it's times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful.}
<A>__{bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven mail.}
<C>__{bilbo }
<D>__{here's a pretty thing. mithril, as light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales. let me see you put it on. come on.}
<A>__{close on: frodo peels off his shirt... revealing the ring on the chain around his neck.}
<C>__{bilbo }
<P>__{(entranced)}
<D>__{oh! my old ring... frodo frowns as bilbo moves toward him.}
<C>__{bilbo }
<D>__{i should very much like to hold it again, one last time. bilbo reaches forward, eyes locked on the ring.}
<A>__{suddenly! a shadow passes across bilbo...for a split second he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony, groping hands. frodo pulls away, shocked...the shadow passes. bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands. bilbo falters...his eyes filling with tears.}
<C>__{bilbo }
<D>__{oh!}
<C>__{bilbo }
<P>__{(sad)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, that i brought this upon you, my boy...i'm sorry that you must carry this burden. i'm sorry for everything.}
<A>__{bilbo sobs and frodo moves to comfort him.}
