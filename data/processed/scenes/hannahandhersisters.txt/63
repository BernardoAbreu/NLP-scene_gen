<A>__{jazz is heard as the movie cuts to the outside of a university library, the camera focused on a huge replica of rodin's thinker before moving to the front entrance. mickey can be seen emerging from its depths. he wears his raincoat, his hands are in his pockets. he ponders the scene as he walks past the statue and a small front garden and down the sidewalk. passersby, some holding books, are seen.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{millions of books written on every conceivable subject by all these great minds, and, and in the end, none of 'em knows anything more about the big questions of life than i do. ss i read socrates. you know, n n n , this guy used to kn knock off little greek boys. what the hell's he got to teach me? and, and nietzsche with his, with his theory of eternal recurrence. he said that the life we live, we're gonna live over and over again the exact same way for eternity. great. that means i, uh, i will have to sit through the ice capades again. tch. it's not worth it.}
<A>__{the movie next cuts to a sunny day in central park. a male jogger, seen through some tree branches, runs by. the camera moves past him, revealing a pondering mickey walking by the reservoir. he continues to talk over the screen.}

<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{remember years ago when hannah and i got divorced and she fixed me up with her sister holly?}
<A>__{the film cuts abruptly to mickey's flashback of his date with holly, beginning with a rock club performance. the soft jazz becomes loud, pulsating rock. three punkers a girl with pink hair, a girl with a spiked mohawk, and a guy with stevie wonder braids and sunglasses watch and bop their heads to the sounds of the offscreen rock band, the 39 steps. the camera moves to the stage, revealing a sleazy looking rock band in the midst of their number.}

<A>__{as the band loudly plays on, the camera moves across the spellbound audience, sitting at crowded, smoky, small tables, to reveal a stricken mickey and a mesmerized holly squeezed together at one of them. a nearby member of the audience swills beer from a bottle. holly, beating time to the music and enjoying herself, takes a puff of her cigarette. she wears a wristful of silver bracelets. she glances at mickey impatiently. he's the only one in the place wearing a suit.}

<D>__{"i don't wanna be different said i'm gonna be just like you because i'm gonna buy the records that they play on radio...}
<A>__{holly turns back to the band, who are still in full swing. the camera moves down the body of the lead singer, singing into a microphone, from his longish, curly red hair, through his cut off red shirt and sweaty torso, to his guitar. he wears several silver bracelets on his wrists and gold bracelets on his upper arm. the microphone screeches feedback.}

<A>__{the camera moves back to holly and the even more stricken looking mickey. they are crowded in with people. in the background, a waitress holds up a tray. a man drinks from a glass mug; people chatter indistinctly over the loud band. the club is noisy, smoky, and thick with people. holly glances at mickey once again, this time unable to contain her annoyance.}

<A>__{...as the film cuts abruptly to outside the rock club. the music has stopped. mickey and holly, almost in dark silhouette, are walking at a fast clip along the sidewalk, arguing. they pass some lighted clothing store windows; a few cars go by in the dark street.}

<P>__{(enthusiastically)}
