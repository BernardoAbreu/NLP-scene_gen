<A>__{e.c.u. on magnetois belt, which is lined with metal straps. magnetois hand comes into frame holding cyclopsi visor and places it against one of the straps. the strap wraps itself back and around, pinning the visor to the belt. he brings a radio to his mouth.}

<D>__{mystique... mystique, where are you?}
<A>__{magneto turns to sabretooth.}
<C>__{magneto }
<D>__{find logan.}
<A>__{sabretooth exits as magneto turns to reveal jean and cyclops, without his visor, are trapped in a hideous tangle of metal (taken from the statueis steel bracing) forcing the two to face each other. two sharp points of metal rest on either side of cyclopsi head, locking it in position. cyclopsi is close enough to feel jean's breath if he opens his eyes, he will destroy everything in his path, including jean. storm is also encased in a myriad of sharp metal bands, pinning her to the wall. razor sharp pieces of metal warp and close on her throat. all in all, they are completely disabled. jean struggles to free them with her telekinesis, to no avail.}
<C>__{cyclops}

<D>__{jean... can you?}
<C>__{jean}
<P>__{(whispering)}

<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{if the temperature changes a single degree...}
<P>__{(looking at jean)}
<D>__{i only need one hostage.}
<A>__{magneto stares icily at storm. as if to accentuate the threat, a piece of metal pokes ever so slightly into the side of storm's throat.}
<C>__{magneto }
<P>__{(raising his voice)}
<D>__{now if you can hear me logan...}
