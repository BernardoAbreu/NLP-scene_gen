<L>__{interior finch's apartment}
<A>__{finch sits alone in his modest apartment, reading a book. the book is koesterler's, "the roots of coincidence." an old cd player is playing music, a bach piano concerto.}
<L>__{interior shadow gallery}
<A>__{v is playing the exact same concerto on his piano, his gloved fingers gracefully flitting across the keys. evey enters the gallery. her hair has grown out but is still short. she projects a kind of strength that comes from a deep inner peace. v coaxes the final delicate notes and lets them softly fade.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{that was beautiful.}
<A>__{she walks up to him and takes the smiling face in her hands.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i've wanted to do this for a long time.}
<A>__{she bends and gently kisses the frozen lips.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{thank you, v. thank you for everything you've done for me.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{you did it all yourself, evey. i just provided the backdrop but the drama was all your own.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{it was a good backdrop. i believed it. i really did. it's still a bit hard for me to accept that it wasn't real. that it was just you. especially the letter.}
<A>__{she takes the letter from her pocket.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{it is a beautiful letter, v. every time i read it i could feel valerie, almost like she was holding me. i believed in her most of all. i believed that she loved me and i loved her back.}
<A>__{she looks down.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i feel a bit foolish telling you this. i know that you must have written it and thought you should have it back.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{but i didn't write that letter, evey.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{come with me.}
