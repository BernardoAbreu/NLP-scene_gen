<L>__{exterior field day}
<A>__{shane is rolling out with morris on his heels again. he can't find anyone open and runs out of bounds.}
<B>__{in huddle}
<A>__{everybody is breathing hard, beat up and exhausted. shane leans in.}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(to reese evans)}
<D>__{you got to double up on morris.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{he's too far outside for me to get to him.}
<P>__{(to cochran)}
<D>__{bring him down and sit on him.}
<C>__{cochran}
<D>__{he's huge! he's been beating the crap out of me all day! i feel like a rag doll out here.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i will help this time.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{okay. spread left 'a' right, roll right half back sail. on two.}
<A>__{they break. shane sets up in the shotgun.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{red, fifteen. hut, hut!}
<A>__{on the snap, lee and cochran double team morris. morris slaps cochran away like, well, a rag doll, and then confronts the sumo master. he bumps stomachs with lee. lee flies through the air and lands on his ass.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{he spots his receiver, he cocks his arm and wham! morris decks him. and, of course, lands on him. oooof!}
<C>__{morris}
<P>__{(to shane)}
<D>__{it's just me, fuck face!}
<A>__{in order to get up, morris puts one huge hand on shane's helmet and pushes himself up. shane moans as his face guard digs a four inch hole in the turf. on mcginty he's talking into his mike.}
<D>__{mcginty you want a time out? that looks like it hurt.}
<A>__{shane gets up. he's got a huge piece of turf stuck in his face guard so that for a beat, we can't even see him. then he pulls out the dirt and grass, and we see shane really pissed off for the first time.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{huddle up!}
<A>__{everyone gathers around.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{same thing... except...}
<P>__{(to lee and cochran)}
<D>__{let him in. don't touch him.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{shane...}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{shut up! let him through. on two.}
<A>__{they break the huddle. shane goes into a shotgun.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{red fifteen. hut! hut!}
<A>__{shane does a three step drop from the shotgun. cochran and lee hit out on either side of morris, giving him a clear shot at shane. morris comes hard and fast. shane looks downfield, winds up, turns and fires the ball at morris's head. the ball goes like a bullet for five feet and then sticks like a dart in morris's face guard. for a moment, morris is blinded. and shane is dumbfounded. then morris starts to wrestle the ball out of his mask.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{get him!}
<A>__{andre and jamal grab onto morris who starts stumbling down field with the ball still stuck in his helmet.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{morris intercepts! wait! the ball is stuck in his face!}
<A>__{but morris won't go down. he's still trying to pry the ball loose as he throws off jamal. then he shakes off andre.}
<B>__{on brian murray}
<A>__{he's in slow motion in midair, diving towards morris. murray's pov it's absolutely quiet (he's deaf, remember?) as he soars towards morris's head, helmet and ball. wham! murray's full body weight hits morris in the helmet, which flies off and rolls across the field with the ball still stuck in it. out of the silence, we suddenly hear the hit and the crowd roar. morris goes down like a building with murray buried in his throat. on room (d.c.) todd, rod and bob are destroying todd's den in reaction to the hit.}
<B>__{on another living room}
<A>__{annabelle is screaming "whoa!" to that hit. on o'neil and augustine they're watching on tv.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{now that's a hit!}
<B>__{on ball and helmet}
<A>__{it's in the very chubby hands of mickey lee, who is rumbling downfield with the fumble helmet recovery. new york players have been slow to pick this up because they, too, have been admiring the lick that murray put on morris. suddenly, the whole team is chasing lee. they catch him pretty easily at the twenty, but lee represents a lot of weight. lee staggers across the ten, shaking players off left and right. one defensive halfback sacrifices himself and throws himself at lee's feet. lee trips over the guy, gains his footing again, walks on the guy (who screams in agony) and falls into the end zone carrying three players with him.}
<B>__{on madden and summerall}
<A>__{john is beside himself.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{lee scores! lee scores! lee scores! i love to see a fat guy score!}
<B>__{on lee}
<A>__{he gets up in jubilation, spikes the ball helmet combination, and runs through the back of the end zone. but he doesn't stop. he's aiming for a low wall that separates the first row of fans from the field.}
<B>__{on four fans}
<A>__{they see mickey rumbling at them and they all get the picture at the same time. they scream!}
<B>__{on mickey}
<A>__{he launches himself into the stands in ecstasy.}
<B>__{on four fans}
<A>__{crunch! lee lands on all four of them.}
<B>__{on football}
<A>__{it's hiked into shane's hands and pacifico boots the extra pointerior}
<B>__{on scoreboard}
<A>__{"giants 10 redskins 10 time remaining: 58 seconds."}
<B>__{on sideline}
<A>__{murray and lee are getting congratulations from everyone.}
<C>__{pacifico}
<P>__{(to murray)}
<D>__{what a hit!}
<P>__{(slower)}
<D>__{what a hit!}
<A>__{murray nods that he understands.}
<C>__{evans}
<P>__{(to murray)}
<D>__{i'm proud of you, kid.}
<A>__{jamal and andre are hugging lee. in the b.g., we can see paramedics lifting one of lee's four fans onto a stretcher.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{you're the one, you're the one, you're the one...}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{you think that's worth a shoe deal?}
<A>__{mcginty walks into the middle of it.}
<D>__{mcginty stop with the lovefest! let's get the goddamn ball back and win this thing!}
