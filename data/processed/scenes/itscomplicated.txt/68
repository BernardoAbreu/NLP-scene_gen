<L>__{interior lauren and harley's cottage moments later}
<A>__{jane and adam, two very straight laced grown ups, enter the party, pausing as they peruse the crowd.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{how you feeling?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{totally fine.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{me too.}
<A>__{adam starts to move to the music insanely well and then just insanely. lauren and harley greet them. jane greets them back with a huge hug.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{hi... love your dress. hey harls.}
<C>__{harley}
<P>__{(that's weird...)}
<D>__{harls...?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{adam, this is my oldest, lauren and her fiance, harley.}
<P>__{(giggles to kids)}
<D>__{we're on a date.}
<A>__{adam and jane stifle laughs. at the bar wide moments later jane and adam chat with all the kids. looks like it's going great adam is a big hit. on jake watching from across the room jake nurses a drink and is not looking happy. he sees the kids disperse, finishes off his vodka, ready to make his move.}
<B>__{on jane and adam}
<A>__{now alone. they haven't seen jake yet.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(starts moving to the music jane laughs)}
<D>__{by the way how great is this party? let's be the last to leave.}
<P>__{(bops to the music then spots jake across the room, seriously eyeing him.)}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{hey, there's your ex husb uh oh. he's headed right toward us. not the time to be "feeling groovy"}
<P>__{(dances again when he sees}
<D>__{jake in slow mo getting}
<P>__{closer and closer)}
<D>__{oooo. why so intense, big fella?}
<A>__{adam slides a bit behind jane as jake arrives with agness who looks inappropriately youthful.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hello jane.... adam.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(all smiles)}
<D>__{hey, good to see you again.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{adam, this is agness, jake's wife...}
<P>__{(suddenly realizing)}
<D>__{now that is an odd sentence for me to say since that was me for most of my life. seriously. how weird is that? both of us married to the same man!}
<C>__{agness}
<P>__{(dismissing the idea)}
<D>__{you know... it's... hey, what are you gonna do?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{yeah, why go there.}
<A>__{at this point, adam gets hit with a severe case of the giggles. as the rest continue, he can't keep a straight face.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{because there, is...fascinating. i mean, when you think about it, it sort of links us in some cosmic crazy way, doesn't it, agness? of all the men on the planet, we both said "i do" to this guy.}
<C>__{agness}
<D>__{yeah. twenty five years apart. i know you're having like an "ah ha' moment, but i think i'm gonna get a refill. adam, good meeting you.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(whispers to jane as agness exits)}
<D>__{she's got a really scary tattoo.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{janey, can i talk to you for a quick sec?}
<A>__{jake nods his head toward the bathroom and heads for it. jane looks to adam.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{he always needs me for a quick sec.}
<P>__{(starts to exit)}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{oh, i'm very okay!}
