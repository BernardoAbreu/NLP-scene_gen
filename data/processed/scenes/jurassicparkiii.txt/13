<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior walking to the main tents day}
<A>__{billy takes one of grant's bags, talking as they go.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{how was your trip? profitable?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{we'll be broke in four weeks.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{three weeks. i had to rent some equipment.}
<A>__{the cross into one of the tents, which only has two "walls". on a dust taped table, a dusty macintosh is feeing data into a strange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator. a mechanical arm sweeps back and forth across a tray of fine sand.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you rented an automated litter box.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{it's a rapid prototyper. i feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. it's the future of paleontology.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{not if it can't dig.}
<A>__{the arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of a person's fist.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i give you a raptor's resonating chamber.}
<A>__{grant hates technology, but he can't help but be amazed by the result. he lifts the strange object up, shaking out the remaining sand. billy puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell. the resulting sound is unique and piercing, the cry of an non existent animal. grant is speechless with excitement. and so he uses it again and again, producing different sounds and variations. in the distance, flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off. billy looks up to see a man and a woman getting out of a cadillac. cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the tent.}
<C>__{billy }
<P>__{(falsely casual)}
<D>__{oh, i forgot to tell you. some visitors wanted to come by and talk to you. i}
<A>__{told them you'd be happy to see them.}
<D>__{maybe even have dinner with them.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{absolutely not.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{they're here.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{only now does grant realize these two people who were walking up to them. putting on a friendly smile, billy goes up to them.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{dr. grant?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(extending his hand)}
<D>__{paul kirby. kirby enterprises}
<P>__{(reaching into his pocket)}
<D>__{my card.}
<A>__{paul kirby is a talkative optimist with no "off" switch. his wife amanda kirby, just as friendly, is harder to read. there seems to be exhaustion behind her eyes.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{what can i do for you, mr. kirby?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well sir, i am a great admirer}
<A>__{of yours, and i have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. would you let my wife and i take you to have dinner tonight? our treat.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you know, i've been traveling and i'm very tired. maybe some other time.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i guarantee it'll be worth your while.}
<A>__{behind kirby, bill furtively rubs his thumb and fingers together, indicating the guy is loaded. grant musters a weak smile.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{it's be my pleasure.}
