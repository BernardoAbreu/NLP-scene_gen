<L>__{exterior boulevard night}
<A>__{joe hallenbeck is running full out. headlong down the sidewalk. gasping for breath.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{move!!}
<A>__{he slams into a man. knocks him flat. groceries fly. joe doesn't care. he stumbles. keeps going.}
<L>__{exterior nighttime street same time}
<A>__{jimmy dix is behind the wheel of a silver jag. cory is driving a spanking new ford fiero. jimmy follows behind cory, watchdogging. humming with joe cocker on the radio. cory comes to a red light. pauses. turns right onto a sidestreet. jimmy slows, pausing at the intersection.}
<B>__{gray sedan}
<A>__{passes jimmy. accelerating. engine revving. jimmy only gets one glimpse into the passing car. it's enough: everyone inside is armed to the teeth. the sedan roars around the corner, cutting in front of jimmy.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{oh god. this is a hit this is a fucking hit!!}
<B>__{gray sedan}
<A>__{comes up behind cory. comes up fast. rams her car. metal crumples. meanwhile:}
<B>__{jimmy}
<A>__{frantically floors the pedal of his jag, pops the clutch and stalls out. he roars with anger. flings open the door. leaps out and runs forward, screaming:}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{cory, get out of there!!}
<A>__{too late. cory is already out of her car, yelling:}
<C>__{cory}
<D>__{hey, can't you fucking drive??}
<A>__{her eyes go wide with shock. the hitmen burst from their car. open up on full auto. cory is cut down. blown backward over the hood of her ford. flung to the street.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{oh gooood!!}
<A>__{and without missing a beat, the hitmen turn and open fire on jimmy. he takes a running start. clears the hood of his jag in a single leap. bullets dice the metal behind him. he lands, hard. sucks the ground. huddled behind his car, as:}
<B>__{two hitmen}
<A>__{move toward him, triggering three shot bursts. the kid is dead meat. or so it seems until, without warning }
<B>__{joe hallenbeck}
<A>__{charges into the intersection. screaming bloody murder. he's got a gun in each fist, and both are blazing. one hitman dies immediately: dances like a puppet, racked by gunfire. bullets go through him. shatter the sedan's windshield. the second hitman turns and opens up on hallenbeck. too late. joe rolls behind a mailbox. bullets chase him, blowing apart the metal box. the hitman swears. turns, running for the sedan. he knows when a getaway is in order. just one problem. he forgot about jimmy dix. a screech of tires. as jimmy's jag slews around the corner, laying rubber. rockets toward the hitman, pins him in its headlights the hitman screams as jimmy plows through him and crunches into the gray sedan. shatters the hitman between the two cars... and holy christ, the guy's still alive. pinned like a butterfly, legs broken... he raises his rifle, screaming. jimmy dives flat on the front seat. the windshield erupts. the hitman. still pinned. still screaming. he fires shot after shot into jimmy's car. hallenbeck walks up behind him. puts a bullet in his head. he stops screaming.}
<B>__{jimmy}
<A>__{is still huddled on the front seat in a sea of broken glass. hallenbeck walks up, leans in the window.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{hey.}
<P>__{(as jimmy looks up)}
<D>__{back up.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{jimmy puts it in reverse. the car backs up. steam pouring from the crumpled hood. the hitman, now freed, collapses to the street. like a sack of flour. hallenbeck limps toward him, wheezing. he stops as:}
<B>__{motel manager}
<A>__{stands outside a door marked office. holding a pump action shotgun leveled at hallenbeck. hallenbeck nods at the bodies in the street.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{it's all over, compadre.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{get off my property, mister.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(scowls)}
<D>__{sidewalk belongs to the government.}
<A>__{he turns and looks at jimmy. the kid is in pain. staring at cory's bullet riddled body. eyes glazed. hallenbeck says nothing. he crosses to the shattered hitman. kneels down, fishes through the guy's coat pockets. comes up with a bloody pack of cigarettes. extracts one. lights it. sirens fill the air. and jimmy snaps out of it long enough to reach into his coat takes out the vial of coke. ditches it. drops it down a sewer grating, out of sight. no one sees him do it.}
<B>__{police cruisers}
<A>__{come squealing up, flashers turning. surrounding jimmy, who stands, head down and motionless and joe, who smokes and looks at the moon.}
