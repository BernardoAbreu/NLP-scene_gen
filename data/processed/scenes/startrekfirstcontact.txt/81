<L>__{interior borg hive}
<A>__{it's a while later, and the borg are making progress. data is strapped to the table, panels open on his head and chest. three borg drones are working methodically on his inner circuitry. the jagged voice of the woman cuts in:}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{your resistance is... illogical. to us, your neural net is simply another piece of technology. we will learn its secrets.}
<A>__{data stares at the murky ceiling.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{i am the borg.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{that is a contradiction. the borg act as a collective consciousness. there are no individuals.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{i am the beginning... the end. i am the one who is many. i am the borg.}
<A>__{out of the mist that hugs the top of the room descends the borg queen. she is unlike any of the borg drones we've ever seen a humanoid female with conduits and tubes running out of her body. she has no legs. her torso is suspended by a complex rig of cables and hydraulics. her face and upper torso are much more humanoid, with the pasty pale white of borg flesh. her eyes have a silvery glint to them. her demeanor is seductive and sensual in contrast to the harsh, mechanical surroundings. she is an eerie blend of two worlds organic and mechanical. with the soft hiss of hydraulics, she lowers herself down to where her face is very close to that of data's. her features are almost angelic, but the silvery glint in her eyes betrays an inner darkness.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{you are the guiding intelligence behind the borg...?}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{intelligence... ambition... desire... i bring order to chaos...}
<A>__{she studies his face with a certain child like quality.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{it's unfortunate we will have to destroy you to obtain the information we need. you are a... unique lifeform.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{synthetic... and yet far more than a simple automaton. you have no idea how close to perfection you are.}
<A>__{she stares at him intently, and we get the hint that her interest in data may go beyond simple assimilation. she seems fascinated by him. data picks up on this.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{how do you define perfection?}
<A>__{the queen opens her arms slightly, clearly indicating herself.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{a blending of the organic and the synthetic. the highest form of life in the galaxy.}
<A>__{data eyes her, considering.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{an interesting definition. but it is not one that applies to me. i am completely artificial. i have no organic components.}
<A>__{she looks at him as a new thought crosses her mind. she might've just found the chink in data's armor.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{it is impossible to imagine sensations for which i have no frame of reference.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{that... can change.}
<A>__{the queen looks to the three borg drones and gives them a silent command. the drones immediately stop working on data's open panels... and shift their attention to his right arm. one of the drones tears off the sleeve on data's uniform, exposing his bare arm. another then uses a small cutting device to slice off the synthetic skin from data's arm. as data prepares himself for the worst...}
