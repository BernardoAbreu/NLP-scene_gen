<L>__{interior catherine's world}
<A>__{a bright, deliriously colorful realm visually reflective of things we saw in catherine's home. unusual trees, rock formations, totems, statues, and a brilliant pool of water. the pond ripples. visible through the crystal clear water is young stargher, rising to the surface like a drowning victim suddenly breaking through to air. panicked, he scrambles to shore and pulls himself to land. although the place is comforting and beautiful, he's in strange territory and it frightens him. shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this way and that.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{you're all right, carl.}
<A>__{the boy turns toward the voice and finds catherine, her hair waving in the wind, skin glowing, eyes bright, cutting a magnificent figure in clothes that make her a warrior goddess. she opens her arms and the boy runs to her, basking in the comfort of her embrace. he shivers and she holds him tightly.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{it's okay, honey, you're with me now. you're safe here.}
<A>__{she looks deeply into his eyes and reassuringly explains.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{i promised i would help you, and i always keep my promises.}
<C>__{young stargher}
<D>__{can...}
<A>__{catherine is astonished and relieve to hear him speak. a sad, trembling little voice.}
<C>__{young stargher }
<D>__{can i stay here?}
<A>__{she is touched that he would ask and strokes his face.}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(regretfully)}
<D>__{oh...no, honey, i'm sorry. it's doesn't work that way.}
<A>__{the boy breaks away from her, turning his back. she gently takes his hand but he yanks it free.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{but what if i told you you could come visit?}
<A>__{he slowly turns to her.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{i will make sure it happens, carl. i will get them to let me do it. and maybe... maybe we can...}
<A>__{young stargher's eyes open wide with silent terror. over his shoulder, she sees a snake slither through the pool. centipedes crawl over her legs and hair. she stands and brushes them off. the atmosphere grows darker and ominous.}
<C>__{young stargher}
<D>__{he found me...}
<A>__{catherine bristles as stargher king rises from the pool like a human serpent. the brilliant colors of catherine's world fade to grim tones.}
<C>__{young stargher }
<D>__{he always finds me.}
<A>__{stargher king screeches with anger and confusion.}
<C>__{stargher king}
<D>__{where thiisss att?!?! me god no like id here...}
<A>__{he snarls when he sees catherine.}
<C>__{stargher king }
<D>__{you. priddy bish hor kund. you big trubble mekker...}
<P>__{(sneers at the boy)}
<D>__{and you. you cumm home now, liddle cogsugger worm. or me god haffa punish you...}
<A>__{young stargher tightens his embrace of catherine. she steps back, away from the pond, hugging the boy tightly.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{no.!}
<C>__{stargher king}
<D>__{no?!??!?!?!?}
<A>__{stargher king laughs.}
<C>__{stargher king }
<D>__{hoo you thing you are?? himm muther?}
<A>__{he comes close and reaches for the boy...}
<C>__{stargher king }
<D>__{you gimme liddle worm.}
<A>__{for a moment, catherine appears frightened and intimidated. perhaps near an emotional breakdown. but that is not the case. she quietly lowers little carl to the ground and whispers something in his ear. as the boy nods, runs and hides, a ferocity grows within her.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i said no.}
<A>__{like a vengeful valkyrie, she emits what can only be called a battle cry! stargher attacks! arms reaching for her. catherine blocks, punches, and kicks. stargher king doubles over. catherine grabs his ears and pulls his face into her bent knee, breaking his nose.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{welcome to my world.}
<A>__{as blood flows from his nostrils, stargher king grins...}
<C>__{stargher king}
<D>__{you funny. you thing you stop me god?}
<A>__{he charges. at the right moment, catherine sidesteps and smashes him in the ribs as he passes. stargher king crumples to the ground and she kicks an uppercut to this chin. rising from the mud and muck, stargher king lands a powerful blow to her head, sending her flying. he lifts the stunned catherine with one hand and pulls her face to his...}
<C>__{stargher king }
<D>__{you cum back wif me god. you be good bish hor kund...}
<A>__{catherine looks into his soulless eyes. then spits in them and bites his face! she breaks free as he yowls with pain. he steps toward her, but his feet don't move. the earth itself appears to wrap around them and turn hard, like concrete. stargher king howls with frustration.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{my world...}
<A>__{a shimmering knife seems to enrage from within her forearm, out the flesh and into her hand.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{my rules.}
<A>__{she slashes across his chest, drawing blood.}
<C>__{young stargher }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{catherine stops. and turns to see the distraught young stargher.}
<C>__{young stargher }
<D>__{don't hurt him!}
<A>__{she spins around and sees not stargher king, but martin.}
<C>__{young stargher }
<D>__{he didn't mean it. i was bad.}
<A>__{disturbed by the transformation, catherine backs away. her vision blurs, the sound distorts. and the earth cracks around stargher king's ankles.}
<C>__{young stargher }
<D>__{he teached me a lesson. i deserved it.}
<A>__{fighting feelings of disorientation, she kneels before the child and rests the knife on the ground.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{no one deserves it, carl. no one.}
<A>__{she reaches out to him, but the child is jerked into the air by stargher king. in one hand, the monster holds little carl. in the other a knife. his face and chest red with crimson, stargher king fixes his eyes on catherine with a predator's stare.}
<C>__{stargher king}
<D>__{yer world. my knife.}
<A>__{stargher king raises the blade toward the boy's throat and snap! the strong arms of an adult stargher breaks his arm at the elbow. both the knife and boy are dropped to the ground as stargher king yowls like a stuck pig, the good arm cradling the other.}
<C>__{stargher king }
<D>__{me god hurt! why you do that? why?!}
<C>__{stargher}
<D>__{enough.}
<A>__{stargher king regards him with disgust.}
<C>__{stargher king}
<D>__{enuff?!?!}
<A>__{martin stargher's voice comes from the belly of the beast.}
<C>__{stargher}
<D>__{i will tell you what's enough...}
<A>__{stargher and stargher king square off. the boy stands between them with the knife at his feet.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{carl!}
<C>__{stargher king}
<P>__{(still speaking as martin)}
<D>__{shut up cunt.}
<P>__{(to the boy)}
<D>__{give it here, worm...}
<A>__{the child picks up the blade and stands between them, looking to catherine for guidance.}
<C>__{stargher king }
<P>__{(as martin)}
<D>__{you want a mommy? is that what you want?}
<A>__{in an almost dream like motion, the child hands the blade to adult stargher.}
<C>__{stargher}
<D>__{enough.}
<A>__{and he drives the thing into stargher king's heart. for a brief moment, martin's face is superimposed over stargher king's. stunned, he slumps and regards adult stargher with sad, troubled eyes.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(as stargher king)}
<D>__{why? what'd i do?...}
<A>__{stargher twists the handle of the blade and martin stargher king drops dead. dead. young stargher smiles and hugs catherine.}
<C>__{young stargher}
<D>__{time to go 'way.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{carl...?}
<A>__{the boy runs to adult stargher who lifts the child into his arms and holds him close.}
<C>__{young stargher}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{she looks to adult stargher and begins to understand. he descends into the pool, the boy resting his head on his shoulder.}
<C>__{stargher king}
<D>__{thank you, catherine. you did help me. more than you'll ever know.}
<A>__{man and boy disappear beneath the water's surface. catherine stands and sees that stargher king's body has vanished. she walks to the shore and sees, deep underwater, stargher and little carl floating lifelessly like women in the cell. and fade from view:}
<B>__{.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{goodbye carl.}
<A>__{she presses the sensor in her hand.}
