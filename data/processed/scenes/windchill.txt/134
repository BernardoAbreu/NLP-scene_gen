<A>__{the gas pumps are crowded with emergency vehicles and personnel. the morning calm is broken by the beep beep beep of trucks backing up, the bleet of arriving ambulances, the constant chatter of two way radios. our girl is seated in the back of an open ambulance with a blanket draped around her shoulders, allowing emts to treat her frostbite. she watches attendants from the county morgue zip the bodies of our guy and the snowplow driver into bodybags. suddenly she remembers her cellphone, and takes it out. insert cellphone display it's the digital picture of our guy when she first met him, asleep behind the wheel of the `88 olds in student parking.}
