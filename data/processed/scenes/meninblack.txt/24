<L>__{interior farmhouse kitchen night}
<A>__{beatrice sits at the kitchen table, terrified, still wiping away tears from edgar's diatribe. the door opens and edgar comes back into the kitchen, seemingly fleshed out again, leaving the door hanging open behind him. he carries the shotgun. she looks up at him, anxious. but his face is a blank.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{what on earth was it?!}
<A>__{he looks at her strangely. when he speaks, his voice is different than before. more refined.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{sugar.}
<A>__{pause. she looks out the window, at the smoking truck.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{i've never seen sugar do that.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{give me sugar.}
<A>__{puzzled, beatrice gets up, goes to the cabinet, and grabs a bag of sugar. she holds it out to him.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{in water.}
<A>__{frightened, she takes a glass of water from the table. she dumps some of the sugar into it.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{more.}
<A>__{she puts more, till the glass is brimming. she stirs it quickly with a knife and hands it to him, her hand trembling. edgar takes it and downs it in a single gulp. beatrice stares at edgar, no idea what to think. she notices something odd about the skin on his neck.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{edgar, your skin! it's it's just hanging off your bones!}
<A>__{edgar drops the glass and looks in a window, to catch his reflection. he reaches up and twists his whole face, as if adjusting a ski mask, then tucks the skin of his neck back into his shirt collar. he looks at her.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{that better?}
<A>__{beatrice faints.}
