<A>__{the inmates of camp 8 cheer for the american soldiers up on a makeshift movie screen. instead of black and white stripes, the prisoners now wear blue twill. in an audience of new faces, the camera finds some familiar ones. ray and claude are surrounded by their crew willie, radio, poker face, cookie, biscuit, jangle leg and goldmouth. a decade has passed.}

<D>__{...camp 8 is for incorrigibles, so whatever you've done to get here, believe me, we are not impressed. you new men are probably noticing that we have no fences here at camp 8. we don't need no fences, we have the gun line. it runs from shack to shack clear around the yard }

<D>__{can't get right, huh? we'll see how long he last. now, where was i?}
<C>__{hoppin' bob}
<D>__{we don't need no fences at camp 8, boss.}
