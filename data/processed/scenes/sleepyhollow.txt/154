<L>__{exterior church day}
<A>__{baltus crashes out, hits the ground, dragged... outside the fence, daredevil runs with the rope tied around his saddle pommel. the horseman strides forward, sword out. baltus slams the fence and the rope snaps. he is held there awkwardly, gurgling blood. the horseman reaches baltus... chops off his head.}
<L>__{interior sleepy hollow forests day}
<A>__{the storm has passed. empty forest. long, peaceful pause, till ichabod makes his way through, searching the ground. ichabod comes to look down a small hill. the corpse of lady van tassel lies headless, in a dirty, torn dress. ichabod walks to the body. lady van tassel's arm is twisted behind. the sewn cut on the palm of her hand faces up.}

<D>__{here! i have found her...}
<P>__{(looking at corpse, quiet and miserable)}
<D>__{here she is.}
