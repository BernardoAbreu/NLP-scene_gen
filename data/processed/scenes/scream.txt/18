<A>__{click. sidney, quick with the reflexes, shuts it off instantly. a car trunk slams shut outside. sidney pulls herself out of bed and leans to the window just in time to see her dad jumping in his car. she half waves down at him but he doesn't see her. he's as good as gone, pulling out of the driveway and disappearing down the road. a moment as sidney stands at the window, staring out after him.}
