<A>__{james sits watching the news on tv in his apartment, while feeding his budgerigars, (the collection has grown).. he feels terrible. he goes to his desk, pulls out paper and pen... james tries to find the right words, tries to write, tries to put his feelings on paper, but words in general, and letters in particular have never been his thing... james scrunches up the pieces of paper, throws it away. the budgerigars, sensing his distress, flutter and peep..}
