<L>__{exterior the double divide range day}
<A>__{men are working in the corral, saddle horses standing nearby, trying to get a sick calf to suckle a cow. one of the men is tom booker, working along side his brother frank, and his nephew, joe. frank is a good man solid work ethic, christian fearing, wry sense of humor. with the build of a football player, his strength never overwhelms his boyish, good natured heart. joe is eleven, wearing his cowboy hat like a badge of honor. the three men seem as inseparable to each other, as they are to the land. as they work:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{can we take a look at bronty's foal when we're done here, dad?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sure. as long as she don't mind.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{there's a kid at school says we should've imprint trained him.}
<A>__{tom and frank don't say anything. just nod, knowingly.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{he says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's what some folks say.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{there was this thing on the tv about a guy who does it with geese. he has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow.}
<P>__{(to tom)}
<D>__{you hear 'bout that, uncle t?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yeah, i hear about that.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, what do you think about that stuff?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well, joe, i will tell ya i don't know a whole lot about geese. maybe it's okay for them to grow up thinking they're airplanes. but horses, as far as i can tell, can't fly.}
<A>__{frank laughs. joe smirks as tom messes his hat up. there's the sound of a car. they turn. the suburban is coming over the ridge, heading down the driveway in a cloud of dust.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{we expecting company?}
<A>__{frank shakes his head. as the suburban slows down, tom recognizes the driver.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i don't believe it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you know her?}
<A>__{annie, out of her element, hiding behind sunglasses, gets out as tom approaches her by himself. annie girds herself for the confrontation.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{hello, mr. booker. annie maclean. from new york. we talked on the phone.}
<A>__{she extends her hand. tom shakes it, nodding, staring at her curiously.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it's, uh... beautiful country. i had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. there are no signs.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{plenty of signs just none of them printed. who do i get the idea you're not just passing through!}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well... ok... here it is... uh... i'd like you to take a look at my horse. now it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{were you thinking of personally driving me back east?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh no. she's here. i brought him along. and my daughter, too. we're staying at peterson's...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you mean you hauled him all the way out here? just like that?}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(slightly taken aback)}
<D>__{well... yes... i had a trailer. it's not like i made him run along side of the car.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{all by yourself?}
<A>__{she nods. tom cannot help be impressed by her guts and fortitude. camera cuts away for a moment to a window in the ranch house, through which diane frank's fiery, loyal pioneer wife looks at the duo with suspicion.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i uh... ha, ha... i don't think i ever met a lady quite like yourself and i appreciate all the pains you've gone through to }
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{look! please! don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!}
<P>__{(tom, surprised, listens)}
<D>__{i've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. i've brought him here to your neck of the...}
<P>__{(seeing no woods)}
<D>__{ mountains. just take a look at him. if you still feel the same way, i will be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. ok? deal?}
<A>__{tom tries to hide a smile of respect. annie, thinking she may have him, starts backing away towards her car as one would a dangerous animal they think they might have tamed...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{we're at peterson's. whenever you're free. you don't even have to call.}
<A>__{she gets into the suburban. tom watches her drive off.}
