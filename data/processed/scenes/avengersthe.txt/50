<A>__{thru a cloud of steam in an oriental room steed sits naked save for a towel. he hears a disturbance, thru the mist, sees emma before him. automatically, steed dons his bowler and tips it in her direction.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{doctor peel, i presume?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{and you must be steed. please don't get up.}
<A>__{he doesn't. hissing steam between them as they study.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{i was about to throw in the towel.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i had a spot of bother at the door.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{i shouldn't wonder. not a woman inside boodles since }
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{1922. why the kippers?}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?}
<C>__{emma}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{so what was all this some sort of test?}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. i guessed you weren't a stickler for tradition, doctor.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{whereas you are.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{dyed in the wool. but i can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{rules are made to be broken.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{not by me. play by the rules, doctor, or the game is nothing.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{and just what is the game?}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{i say, this is all terribly formal. must i go an calling you dr. peel?}
<C>__{emma}
<P>__{(re: the steamroom)}
<D>__{under the circumstances, you may call me mrs. peel.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{much better.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{and now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{i didn't. mother did.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{mother?}
<A>__{steed steps closer, smiling.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{i expect you'll like him.}
<A>__{off emma's reaction }
