<L>__{interior hotel lobby day full shot sam and the loafers}
<A>__{they sit around, each with his own thoughts. they are generally stolid; only sam seems nervous. he looks up eagerly as doc velie enters the lobby. as he joins sam... sam walks light for a big man, doc.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(straight)}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{you know who!}
<P>__{(doc grins impishly; sam's anger subsides)}
<D>__{what do you think, doc?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{why ask me? he's no salesman, that's sure.}
<P>__{(again the impish grin)}
<D>__{unless he's peddling dynamite.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(squirming visibly)}
<D>__{maybe he's a cop, or something...}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{ever see a cop with a stiff arm?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(squinting thoughtfully)}
<D>__{maybe his arm's all right. maybe he's just holding tight to something in his pocket...}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(scoffing)}
<D>__{like what? a pistol? a stick of t n t?}
<P>__{(gleefully)}
<D>__{to blow up this whole mangy, miserable town!}
<P>__{(with sudden, almost naive, seriousness)}
<D>__{why are you so interested, sam?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{who, me?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i mean, if i was that interested...}
<P>__{(his eyes look up}
<D>__{toward the hotel}
<P>__{stairs o.s.)}
<D>__{...i'd ask him.}
<A>__{sam follows doc's gaze... reverse shot what they see 35x1 macreedy walks down the stairs. pete looks up from the desk. he is about to dart behind the partition when...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{hey! hold it!}
<A>__{he walks to the desk, smiling at pete. in b.g., doc, sam and the loafers watch.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{got any cigarettes?}
<A>__{pete studies him, then bends under the counter, coming up with a pack. doc leaves sam and is slowly walking toward the stranger, eyeing him curiously.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{this is all.}
<A>__{macreedy throws the money on the desk and opens the pack, dexterously using the fingers of his left hand.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{how long you staying?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{in my new room, you mean?}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{i'm staying.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i mean, in the hotel.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{just about twenty four hours.}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{i... i was just askin'.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(evenly)}
<D>__{why? you expecting a convention?}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(doggedly)}
<D>__{i was just askin'.}
<A>__{macreedy looks at him, inhales deeply on his cigarette then, as he slowly lets the smoke out, removes the cigarette and looks at it.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{stale.}
<A>__{now doc is at the desk not far from macreedy. macreedy starts out, then turns to pete.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{where can i rent a car?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{macreedy smiles and sighs tiredly. then...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(as to a child)}
<D>__{let's put it this way if i had a car and if i wanted to put gas in it, where would i go?}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(refusing to cooperate)}
<D>__{but you don't have a car.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(to macreedy)}
<D>__{you might try the garage at the end of the street.}
<A>__{macreedy pauses, looking at doc, who blandly returns his stare.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{doc nods. macreedy smiles and walks toward the door; pete, doc et al watching him. he goes out.}
