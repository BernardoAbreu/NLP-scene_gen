<T>__{cut to a series of party moments over loud music:}
<A>__{ andrew and miguel rocking to heavy metal music, playing a battle of the guitars. at one point, andrew has to sit down, but he doesn't stop "playing," while miguel jumps all around him. joe talking to a man dressed as marie antoinette:}
<C>__{marie antoinette}
<D>__{i'm an accountant. what do you do?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm a lawyer.}
<P>__{(points to lisa)}
<D>__{that's my wife!}
<A>__{ andrew's mother sarah, as marge simpson, delivers a tray of hors d'oeuvres to joe (standing next to a policeman):}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{have a cocktail wienie.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{thanks, sarah.}
<P>__{(to the policeman)}
<D>__{nice costume.}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{it's not a costume, i just got off work. you're cute.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(pointing to lisa)}
<D>__{that's my wife. want to see a picture of my baby?}
<C>__{policeman}
<P>__{(reaching for his wallet)}
<D>__{absolutely. want to see a picture of my baby?}
<A>__{ everyone slow dances to the talking heads tune "heaven" (simply red cover version): joe and lisa, andrew and miguel, rachel with a sleepy amy in her arms, the policeman and tyrone, sarah beckett and marie antoinette, la toya and her snake.}
<D>__{"heaven" continues over:}
<A>__{a cab idling in the street, lisa kissing joe (night).}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i will see you in an hour, max.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{night, honey.}
<A>__{lisa climbs into the cab which she is sharing with the nun and marie antoinette and la toya.}
<D>__{nun marie antoinette la toya night, joe! "heaven" continues over:}
<A>__{quiet in andrew's condo, the party long over (int night). joe opens his briefcase, removing a legal pad with notes.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{congratulations, miller.}
<A>__{andrew clears away party debris from the table, making space for his legal work. he is attached to an iv line, which is connected to a drip bag on a rolling stand, that can move with him. he is no longer in costume.}
<C>__{andrew }
<D>__{you survived your first gay party intact.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{let me tell you something, okay? when you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where i was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. as a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your jointerior and that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{thank you for sharing that with me, joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{let's review these notes for your testimony. we have a big day on monday.}
<A>__{joe begins ticking off a list of courtroom reminders:}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{when you refer to wheeler, call him charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.}
<C>__{andrew}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{uh huh...}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{beckett?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{charles. okay. miller?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{do you... pray?}
<A>__{joe hesitates. they're having a personal conversation?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yeah. sure.}
<A>__{joe goes back to the notes:}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{then we establish how wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{what have you prayed for?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{for a healthy baby. for lisa to make it through the delivery. for the phillies to get into the playoffs.}
<C>__{andrew}
<P>__{(no self pity)}
<D>__{there's a possibility i won't be around for the end of this trial.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i've considered that.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{what happens?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{we proceed, representing your estate.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{i've made provisions in my will for some charities. miguel will need a lawyer. i know it's not your area...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i know a good probate lawyer.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{do you like opera?}
<A>__{andrew moves to the stereo, pulling the iv line with him.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{opera?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{want to hear my favorite aria?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{opera?}
<A>__{suddenly, an aria by maria callas fills the room startling joe with its volume.}
<C>__{andrew}
<P>__{(over the music)}
<D>__{andrea chenier, by giordano. this is madeleine. she's telling how, during the french revolution, a mob set fire to her house. her mother died, saving her. "i look... the place that cradled me was burning!" do you hear the heartache in her voice? then, here come the strings. everything changes. the music fills with hope. madeleine says...}
<A>__{andrew sways through the room to the music, pulling the iv at his side. he seems truly free and relaxed.}
<C>__{andrew }
<D>__{"it was during that sorrow that love came to me! a voice filled with harmony that said... live still, i am life!" "i am the god that descends from the heavens to the earth to make of the earth a heaven!"}
<A>__{angle on joe: shifting, uncomfortable.}
<C>__{andrew }
<D>__{"i am oblivion! i am glory! i am love, love, love!"}
<A>__{the music ends. joe sits there, fidgeting. he reaches for his briefcase organizing his notes.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i think i will... i told lisa.}
<A>__{andrew collects himself, as joe rises from his chair.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{andrew follows joe to the door.}
<C>__{andrew }
<P>__{(businesslike)}
<D>__{i will look over the q and a.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you're ready, don't worry.}
<A>__{an awkward moment, both men standing with their hands at their sides will one of them initiate a handshake? joe gives a little "salute," then leaves.}
