<A>__{helena plays elgar in an empty gymnasium. sunlight streams in staining the air red. as berlin arrives doors on the opposite wall flap together like somebody just hurried out. did he see someone? perhaps not. the trees outside move a lot of shadows. music stands. vacant chairs. berlin takes one to watch her re hearse. realizes just how beautiful she is. and helena realiz es someone is there. before she can ask he identifies himself.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{have you been here long?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{no, just a minute or two .. i knocked on your door no one home, so i followed the music ..}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i will get my things.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{no problem. i'm not in a hurry.}
<A>__{but she's already fussing about stuffing sheet music in a bag.}
<D>__{matter of fact, i saw a little restaurant place down the road. looked kinda pretty? i thought maybe we could have some lunch?}
<A>__{no answer but the answer is no. berlin finds her book for her.}
<D>__{alright, whatever .. was some one in here with you? when i came in the door was flapping?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i don't think so .. no one comes here at the weekends ..}
