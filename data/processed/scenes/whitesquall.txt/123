<L>__{exterior life boat day}
<A>__{the boats have been floated and tied together. skipper is in one, lawford in the other. one of the two boats has been rigged with sail. skipper stands in the bow staring into the ink blue water.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{raise your sail, bill. north, north east. keep a sharp look out for florida.}
<A>__{bill studies him for a moment, then...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{maybe we could wait around a little longer, sir...}
<A>__{there is a long pause before skipper answers.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{she's gone... she's gone.}
<A>__{there is something remarkably touching about this young man trying to take care of him. he puts a hand on skipper's shoulder. it almost makes him crack. he pats bill's hand gently.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{carry on.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{north, north east.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and dick, please make a note of our final position.}
<A>__{lawford nods sullenly. chuck looks out at the floating wreckage around them, silent, lost. suddenly, there is a 'thump' on the hull of the boat. the survivors share a confused look. then it comes again. chuck looks out at the surface of the water. it's suddenly alive... with sharks.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{hands and feet inside the boats.}
<A>__{they come by the dozens. ramming the boats and rummaging through the debris. they swarm around the boats until it seems as if the water is boiling. chuck picks up an oar and starts beating wildly at the sharks.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{aaaahhhh!!!!}
<A>__{the others take up the cause and in a moment they are all screaming and cursing the sharks. it's a frenzy of grief and anger.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{we slashed at the sharks as if striking out at the finger of god. and we all begged silently for the ability to understand what had happened. but, if there was a god that day, his answer came only in the moaning wind and our questions were left to drift unanswered, in the titanic ocean of our deepest grief.}
<A>__{exhausted, chuck stops slashing and stares out. lost.}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(hushed)}
<D>__{wake up. wake up. 1 2 3 wake up.}
<A>__{like robin's nightmare of his brother, this is all too real.}
