<A>__{claire walks in. she notices the clock on the range is dark. she flips on a light. nothing happens. worried, she heads upstairs.}

<L>__{interior bathroom morning}
<A>__{angle claire...her face a mask of terror.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{oh god...}
<A>__{claire's pov the bathtub, with the shower curtain drawn around it, the water blasting. norman's limp hand pokes through the curtain. an electric cord leads from the mirror socket into the tub. claire races over and rips the plug from the wall. she tears the shower curtain away to find a bluish norman lying, unconscious in the tub.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{no, no. please no...}
<A>__{she hugs her face to his chest until she picks up a heartbeat.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{norman!! wake up! please!}
<A>__{claire shakes him to no effect.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{oh god...norman!}
<A>__{she slaps him on the face...once, then twice. he suddenly sucks in a gulp of air, begins struggling and dazedly returns to life.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{it's me...it's me...}
<A>__{sobbing, she shuts off the squeaky faucets and struggles to pull him upright. she discovered her blowdryer in the tub and hurls it across the room.}
