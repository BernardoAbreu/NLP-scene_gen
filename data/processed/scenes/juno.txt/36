<L>__{interior bleeker's house paulie's bedroom night}
<A>__{bleeker lies on his car bed in his track uniform, listening to the same lp from when he and juno went all the way. he stares between the pages of his embossed dancing elk prep yearbook. we see the object of his gaze is juno's black and white yearbook photo. next to it, we see a sloppy, handwritten message from juno. we hear juno's voice reading the message:}
<C>__{juno }
<D>__{hey bleeker! spank off to this with motion lotion. just kidding (kind of.) your best friend, juno.}
<A>__{bleeker picks up the phone. it's the same hamburger phone juno has. he reconsiders and puts it down. there's a knock on the bedroom door. bleeker's mom pokes her dowdy head inside.}
<C>__{bleeker's mom}
<D>__{paul? are you coming downstairs to eat?}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{bleeker's mom}
<D>__{you ran eight miles today, puppy.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{i'm not hungry, oddly.}
<C>__{bleeker's mom}
<D>__{but it's breakfast for supper. your favorite, paulie. i made french toast and sausage. patties, not linkies, just like you like it.}
<A>__{bleeker places his hand silently on his stomach.}
<C>__{bleeker's mom}
<D>__{juno macguff called while you were out running. she wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on saturday.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{thanks for the message.}
<C>__{bleeker's mom}
<D>__{you know how i feel about her.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{you've mentioned it about fifty times.}
<C>__{bleeker's mom}
<D>__{i just hope you don't consider her a close friend.}
<A>__{bleeker's mom gives up and closes the door. we see that bleeker is clutching a pair of panties in one hand, which he slowly releases as the 45 ends.}
