<A>__{med. shot guignol. one of the french punch and judy shows set up on certain days in the small park alongside the broad avenue between the rond point and the place de la concorde. at the moment, judy, as always, is beating punch with a bat. the sound of children laughing and screaming can be heard. various close shots the children sitting on small benches lined up to face the stage. their attention is fixed on the show, their belief totally suspended by the play as only children's can be laughing at the slapstick, booing the villain, frightened by the perils. med. shot reggie sitting on the last bench, next to some children. they are laughing but she isn't she just watches, her attention caught up but her face void of emotion. the bench is too low for her, forcing her knees up almost under her chin. after a moment, peter comes up behind her and, stepping over the benches, sits beside her. she doesn't seem to notice. [throughout the following scene the children and the actors can be heard in the b.g.]}
