<A>__{frank stands across the desk from a young man who, despite his youth, has an irritatingly paternal attitude toward the two men in his office. jack stays in the doorway, smoking a cigarette, as if to venture any further is to risk contracting some hideous disease.}

<P>__{(preparing a cash envelope)}
<D>__{terrific, boys. really. terrific.}
<C>__{frank}

<D>__{uh ... thanks.}
<A>__{frank glances at jack and realizes he should have left him in the kitchen with hector and the soup bone.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{only, jack, do me a favor, will ya, pal? if you wanna smoke, put on a pair of sunglasses and go play with the niggers on state street. these blisters from the midwest don't wanna watch some guy dripping ash all over himself while he's playing 'the sound of music.'}
<A>__{angle jack smoke curls out of jack's nose. he is utterly still, like a pit bull eyeing a steak.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{okay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more}
<A>__{lessons. by the way, frankie, i'm declaring this. lloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk and, business closed, busies himself with other matters.}

<D>__{count the fucking money, frank.}
<A>__{lloyd looks up. jack is staring right into him. reluctantly, frank opens the envelope.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's all here.}
<P>__{(pulling jack out)}
<D>__{i will be talking to you, lloyd.}
<A>__{lloyd doesn't answer. he just looks at jack, smiling with amusement.}
