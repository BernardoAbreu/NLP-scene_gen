<L>__{interior a salon in the vatican day 1780's}
<A>__{we see the six year old mozart, also blindfolded, seated in a gilded chair on a pile of books, playing the harpsichord for the pope and a suite of cardinals and other churchmen. beside the little boy stands leopold, his father, smirking with pride.}
<C>__{old salieri }
<D>__{i admit i was jealous when i heard the tales they told about him. not of the brilliant little prodigy himself, but of his father, who had taught him everything.}
<A>__{the piece finishes. leopold lowers the lid of the harpsichord and lifts up his little son to stand on it. mozart removes the blindfold to show a pale little face with staring eyes. both father and son bow. a papal chamberlain presents leopold with a gold snuff box whilst the cardinals decorously applaud. over this scene old salieri speaks.}
<C>__{old salieri }
<D>__{my father did not care for music. he wanted me only to be a merchant, like himself. as anonymous as he was. when i told how i wished i could be like mozart, he would say, why? do you want to be a trained monkey? would you like me to drag you around europe doing tricks like a circus freak? how could i tell him what music meant to me?}
