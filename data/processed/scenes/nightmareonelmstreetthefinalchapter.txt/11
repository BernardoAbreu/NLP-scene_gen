<L>__{exterior rosedale foster home day}
<A>__{it's a nice looking two story house in the middle of a usually quiet neighborhood. today the home is surrounded by about a dozen townsfolk carrying picket signs: no halfway houses in our neighborhood!, don't lower our property values!, and go back to juvenile hall! the crowd mumbles amongst itself, occasionally bursting out with a chant in protest.}
<B>__{on jacob}
<A>__{we catch him walking down the sidewalk. he tramps along with his hands stuffed in his pockets and his eyes on the pavement. he looks like he hasn't slept in days. the sound of the crowd ahead of him finally grabs his attention. jacob approaches the disturbance and comes across a young girl standing behind a bush holding a bag of groceries. she is karen miller, dark hair, sixteen, very pretty, but with a faraway look in her eyes. jacob stands next to her and stares at the crowd like a zombie. she doesn't turn to look at him as he speaks:}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{free speech. the right of assembly.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what is this place?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it's a home. a foster home. for teenagers. it's where you go when things get bad. it's the place to figure out what to do nexterior it's a home for kids that no one else wants.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's my home.}
<A>__{karen hasn't looked at jacob once. she suddenly seems to steel herself and walks away from the bush, towards the house. jacob is befuddled.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{oh...}
<A>__{he stands there and watches.}
<B>__{in front of the house}
<A>__{karen quickly makes her way into the crowd of people, head up, eyes staring forward. the crowd parts ever so slightly as the irked townsfolk start to heat up. they have an actual human to vent their anger on now. mr. hopkins lays in on her as she passes him.}
<C>__{mr. hopkins}
<D>__{why can't you find somewhere else to shack up?}
<A>__{karen turns to him, still walking, flustered and hurt.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what have we ever done to you?}
<C>__{mr. hopkins}
<D>__{nothing...yet.}
<A>__{karen turns quickly away from him and trips over a sprinkler head. her groceries tumble onto the grass. a hand reaches down to help her. it's jacob's. he quietly helps her re bag her groceries as mr. hopkins looms above them. both angry and embarrassed now.}
<C>__{mr. hopkins }
<D>__{look, we've been here for years. this is a quiet street. we'd just like to keep it that way.}
<A>__{jacob can't take this guy anymore. he stands up and faces the older man with a scowl.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{lighten up, mister.}
<C>__{mr. hopkins}
<P>__{(smirks)}
<D>__{and what gutter did you crawl out from, kid?}
<P>__{(frowns)}
<D>__{we don't want your kind here.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{my kind? what kind is that?}
<C>__{mr. hopkins}
<D>__{drug addicts. dope pushers. we have stand up and take charge.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{swell. i've just got a couple of questions for you...do you love your parents?}
<C>__{mr. hopkins}
<D>__{of course i do...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{are they alive?}
<C>__{mr. hopkins}
<D>__{my mother is.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what's it like?}
<A>__{jacob stares at hopkins. he doesn't answer. he just huffs and puffs as karen grabs jacob and pulls him up to the front porch of the home, then into the floor.}
