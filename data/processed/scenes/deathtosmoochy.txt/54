<L>__{interior limousine continuous action}
<A>__{sheldon slides into the back seat of the limo. a big thug in an overcoat, henry, is already sitting there. merv gets in behind him and shuts the door. sheldon is now wedged between the two men as the limo heads down broadway. merv extends his hand.}
<C>__{merv}
<D>__{merv green, sheldon. it's a pleasure to meet you.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{if you're hoping for an autograph, the gun's a bit much. the whole 'catch more flies with honey' thing it really holds water.}
<A>__{sheldon laughs nervously.}
<C>__{merv}
<D>__{sheldon, i represent the parade of hope foundation. maybe you've heard of us.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{you raise money to build children's hospitals, right?}
<C>__{merv}
<D>__{we've been known to add a brick or two, sure.}
<A>__{merv and the thug laugh.}
<C>__{merv}
<D>__{sheldon, let me get right to the point there's talk on the street that you're pulling out of the ice show. is that true?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<P>__{(big sigh)}
<D>__{you know, i never agreed to an ice show, nor would i ever agree to do an ice show, and let me add that none of this is your concern, sir.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{sheesh.}
<C>__{merv}
<D>__{listen carefully, son: parade of hope has sponsored every kidnet ice show since 1964. we take a piece off the top and everybody walks away happy. so let's not buck history.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{well, i appreciate the offer, but for the gazillionth time, i'm not doing an ice show, so we have nothing to discuss. now, if you'll just pull over, i will get out and we'll say our toodley dos.}
<P>__{(to driver)}
<D>__{far corner, please.}
<C>__{merv}
<D>__{allow me to be less murky. starting tomorrow, smoochy the rhino raises his baton for parade of hope. benefits, banquets, fund raisers, i want it all.}
<P>__{(to driver)}
<D>__{pull over, terry.}
<A>__{the car pulls to the curb.}
<C>__{merv}
<D>__{and as far as the ice show goes... i recommend you start shopping for skates.}
<A>__{the door pops open and sheldon is tossed out.}
