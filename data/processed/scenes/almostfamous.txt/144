<L>__{interior hallway afternoon}
<A>__{the kid is still stuck on the road. he is in hell now. wearily, with deep circles under his eyes, he shuts his eyes for a moment. another band is moving through.}
<C>__{sabbath roadie}
<D>__{keep this hallway clear!}
<L>__{interior backstage trailer dressing room afternoon}
<A>__{william and penny sit on opposite ends of a blue locker room bench. it's a small dressing room, crowded with roadies, guitars and men in stages of half dress. piles of luggage headed for new york sit by the door. the door suddenly opens and dick arrives with champagne and a cake decorated with a sparkler. it is placed in penny's lap. it reads: unforgettable penny... age unknown. boston, 1973. they gather now as the cake sits before a surprised and enchanted penny lane.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{happy birthday from us.}
<A>__{william watches her face as she reads the message on the cake. it hasn't sunk in yet. russell produces a piece of hotel stationery. he reads a poem.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{so penny our friend has gained another year. but long ago, she threw it in gear. she rocked the south the east and west. could you please get off this endless tour where we're black sabbath's fucking special guest?}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{she says she's retired though we've heard that before. she chose us... and in penny lane we trust she is a fan of this band. much more so than us.}
<A>__{william watches her face. still enchanted, she hands out slices of the cake.}
<C>__{dennis hope}
<P>__{(to the point)}
<D>__{sorry the plane isn't bigger.}
<A>__{it hits her. she looks at william for a clue. his truthful face does not look away. now she knows. she turns to the others the plane isn't bigger? shot moves in on penny as she blinks just a little, cutting into the cake, still mugging for everybody, covering it all with a layer of sweet giddy laughter. shot comes to rest behind her, her head turning to connect with band members. each of them look away, nobody maintaining eye contact with her except the one she now doesn't look at. william. she blows out the candles, vamping marilyn monroe style, and sucks off the frosting seductively, to cheers. russell watches, as we push in on penny. she notices all the luggage is gone, only her two cases remain by the door.}
