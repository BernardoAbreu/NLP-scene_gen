<B>__{establishing shot of drew filling the buckets in the stream.}
<A>__{once they are filled, he starts back for the temple. his shoulders are straining from the weight of the buckets. he goes over the path to the temple, having to negotiate logs over chasms, etc. after various trials and tribulations, drew arrives at the temple, his arms incredibly tired. the d.s. is there waiting for him. drew, determined not to show any weakness, raises the buckets a little bit higher. he comes to the d.s., proud and defiant. the d.s. motions for him to put the buckets down. without thinking, drew, puts the buckets down, and they both fall over, spilling their contents onto the ground. drew tries to stop them, but he's too late. the water has all spilled out onto the ground.}
