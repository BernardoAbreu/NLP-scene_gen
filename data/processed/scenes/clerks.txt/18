<L>__{int: convenience store. morning}
<A>__{a very dark room barely lit by the daylight. suddenly, the lights flick on, revealing the glorious interior of the convenience store. the cat looks at dante as he passes the camera quickly. the paper bundle is snapped open with a knife. newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. one rack remains empty. a coffee filter is placed in a metal pot. ground coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in the coffeemaker. the switch is flicked and the machine comes to life. the empty newspaper rack with the heading asbury park press seems out of place among all the other stacks of papers. dante rubs his chin and stares, puzzled. he rolls his eyes as it occurs to him.}
