<C>__{valentine }
<P>__{(pacing, lauding it over yuri)}

<A>__{valentine is infuriated by yuri's casual demeanor.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{are you not paying attention or are you delusional? you've broken every arms embargo written. there's enough in those briefcases to buy you consecutive life sentences. you'll spend ten years going from a cell to a courtroom before you even start doing your time.}
<A>__{yuri is looking away, apparently completely unconcerned. his attitude further angers valentine.}
<C>__{valentine }
<D>__{you don't seem to fully appreciate the seriousness of your situation!}

<P>__{(snapping back his emotion finally showing)}
<D>__{my family has disowned me. my wife and son have left me. my brother is dead. trust me, i fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation. but i promise you i won't spend a single second in a courtroom.}
<A>__{valentine laughs derisively.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{you are delusional.}
<A>__{yuri is still unfazed. he leans forward to close the deal.}
<C>__{yuri}
