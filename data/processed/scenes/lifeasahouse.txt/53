<L>__{exterior george's shack morning}
<A>__{george is up on the roof, hacking through the shingles and beams with a chain saw. a huge dumpster set on the lawn receives only about half the throws george makes. sam is near the ocean in a chaise lounge, listening to music through his portable cd player.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{have you got sunscreen on?}
<A>__{there's no chance he's been heard. tom and barbara, two older neighbors of george's nearing home from a walk, stop on the driveway both look pleased.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{it's about time this shack is torn down.}
<A>__{barbara appears surprised as george turns to face them she obviously didn't realize he was the one up on the roof doing the demolition.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{oh, hello george.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{guess how many low income apartments the city approved for this lot?}
<A>__{tom and barbara react by trying not to react.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{come on...ballpark figure.}
<A>__{tom and barbara step back and walk away. george heads to the ladder and climbs down.}
<B>__{another view}
<A>__{sam is grooving to the music with his eyes closed as george's hand, filled with a gob of sunscreen, plops onto sam's stomach. sam bolts up from the chaise lounge in a rage.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i warned you yesterday.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{don't touch me! you can't touch me!}
<C>__{alyssa }
<D>__{hey, you stayed.}
<A>__{alyssa walks across her lawn to the feuding family. george holds out the bottle of sun lotion to alyssa.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{rub him down, please.}
<A>__{george walks back to the ladder and up onto the roof as alyssa and sam stare at one another.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he's a freak.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{you look better without make up.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i can't even take a shower here.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{come over to my house whenever you want. i will tell my mom.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i might not stay, anyway.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i will get your back.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no. that's okay.}
<A>__{sam reaches out for the lotion, but alyssa hides the bottle.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{have you ever had anyone but your mom or dad put it on for you?}
<A>__{sam thinks about it for a second before shaking his head no.}
<C>__{alyssa }
<D>__{it's weird how different it is. lay down.}
<A>__{george is back with the chain saw, hacking away at the roof. sam is hesitant as he lies down on his stomach. alyssa kneels and squeezes lotion on his back. she works it in, starting at his neck, working her way down to his pants. she squirts sam's arm and as she rubs close to his pit, he squirms.}
<C>__{alyssa }
<D>__{do you remember me from when you lived here?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{your dad dated my mom after her divorce.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i wanted him to marry her.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{turn over.}
<A>__{alyssa grabs under his armpits and tickles him. sam yelps and rises onto his elbows as josh roars by the shack in his porsche.}
<C>__{alyssa }
<D>__{josh and i are going to south coast. wanna ride? maybe see a movie?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{sam is disappointed as alyssa stands to leave.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{don't forget your front.}
<A>__{alyssa walks to the shack and waves goodbye to george. george waves her off. sam curls onto his side as he watches alyssa run across the lawn to josh.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{she's pretty...for a girl.}
<A>__{sam appears irritated as he stands and walks into the garage.}
