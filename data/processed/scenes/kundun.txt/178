<A>__{a few random views of the norbulinka: the wandering deer and peacocks. the fish pond and its inhabitants. over these pictures we hear words:}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso }
<D>__{"i rejoice in the awakening of the buddhas, and also in the spiritual levels of their sons."}

<C>__{tenzin gyatso }
<D>__{"and with gladness i rejoice in the ocean of virtue from developing an awakening mind that wishes all beings to be happy..."}
<A>__{the yellow wall. the dalai lama's red room.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso }
<D>__{"as well as in the deeds that bring them benefit.}
<A>__{and now, we hear the voices of a great many people, reciting:}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<C>__{and others }
<D>__{"with folded hands i beseech the buddhas of all directions. to shine the lamp of dharma for all bewildered in the gloom of misery."}
