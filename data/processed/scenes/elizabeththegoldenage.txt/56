<A>__{immense stacks of cut timber as far as the eye can see. skeletons of new ships, big ships, rising in the great yard. hundreds of ship builders at work. his is what the forests were felled for: a brand new fleet is being built. tiny figures in the wide scene: the royal party appears. philip has come to see progress for himself. as he and his entourage tour the construction site, one of his ministers briefs him on the latest developments in england.}
<C>__{spanish minister}
<D>__{it can't be denied that we've lost the advantage of surprise. a large part of our plans has come into their hands.}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{the jesuit is still at liberty?}
<C>__{spanish minister}
<D>__{we understand so, majesty.}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{he knows his business. we've lost nothing.}
<A>__{the workmen kneel to philip as he passes.}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{tell the carpenters to go on working. no one is to stop for me. the fleet must be ready to sail in a month.}
<C>__{spanish minister}
<D>__{impossible, majesty!}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{if this is god's work, god will make it possible.}
<C>__{spanish minister}
<D>__{only a miracle }
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{a miracle, then. let it be done!}
