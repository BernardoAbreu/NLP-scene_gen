<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no. there's no hairstyle that will put you in the bad place. like i've told you, the main things are hurting people physically on purpose, taking people's stuff, doing things to people they don't want done, killing people on purpose. okay? are we good?}
<A>__{the crowd nods apprehensively. many of the people in the crowd are crying. one of the crying men, shaking like a leaf, stands up, with terror in his eyes.}
<C>__{crying man}
<P>__{(shameful)}
<D>__{i've done many of those bad things. is there anything i can do to not go to the bad place? help me, i'm so scared.}

<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{am i fine? woman #5}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{what about me?}
<A>__{tons of people shout similar sentiments.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you're all fine! i'm only talking about people who do bad things starting right now. everyone else is fine.}
<A>__{the crowd erupts in a massive cheer. people hug each other passionately, wiping tears from their eyes.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{number seven: the man in the sky who controls everything decides if you go to the good place or the bad place. he also decides who lives and who dies. man #4 does he cause natural disasters?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes. woman #3 did he cause my mom to get cancer?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes. woman #4 did he cause that tree to land on my car last week?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the crowd is quiet for a long beat....they're mulling this over. the first man to speak is a blue collar guy with a thick brooklyn accent.}
<C>__{blue collar guy}
<D>__{i say fuck the guy that lives in the sky!}
<A>__{the whole crowd erupts in agreement. people stand up shouting, flicking off the sky.}
<D>__{man #5 yeah! that guy's a fucking asshole! woman #5 that motherfucker better hope i never see him face to face! man #6 that guy's a fucking coward! hiding up there and doing bad shit to us! why doesn't he do it to our faces? woman #6 we need to stop that motherfucker before he kills us all!}
<A>__{mark looks worried. he didn't anticipate this. suddenly a thought occurs to him.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{everyone quiets down.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{this guy who lives in the sky and controls everything is also responsible for all the good stuff that happens.}
<A>__{the whole crowd "aaaahhs".}
<D>__{man #7 he's the guy who saved my life on that fishing trip when the boat capsized?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yup. man #7 did he capsize the boat?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well, yes. woman #7 he's the one who killed my grandmother and left me those millions of dollars?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you betcha. woman #3 so is he the same one who cured my mom's cancer?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that too.}
<A>__{the crowd thinks this over.}
<D>__{man #8 so he's kind of a good guy, but he's also kind of a prick too?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{right. but check this out:}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{number eight: even if the man in the sky does bad shit to you, he makes it up to you by giving you an eternity of good stuff after you die.}
<A>__{the crowd "aaahhs" again.}
<D>__{woman #1 as long as you don't do any of the bad stuff you listed, right?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{right. of course. woman #2 so it's kind of a test?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes. right.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{well, that's it. that's everything i know.}
<A>__{mark looks out at the crowd, they're all exhausted, their minds completely blown. the nurse who started this all steps forward.}
<D>__{nurse #1 how do you know these things?}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{the man in the clouds told me. nurse #1 yeah, but how come we're just learning these things now, millions of years into our existence?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't know, he forgot or something. i gotta go people, good night!}
<A>__{mark takes jennifer by the hand and pulls her back inside his building.}
