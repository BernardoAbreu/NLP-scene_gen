<D>__{during your "interview," while you were..."under the influence," you told us you liked music!}
<A>__{cole, confused, looks around, sees he's in a one bed windowless room adorned with cheap reproductions of 19th and 20th century landscapes. the botanist responds to cole's obvious disbelief with a friendly smile and the others join in rapid fire, overlapping.}

<D>__{this is a hospital.}
