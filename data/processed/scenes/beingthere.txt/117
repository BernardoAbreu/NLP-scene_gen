<L>__{interior cocktail lounge night}
<A>__{an 'in' meeting place for the upper middle washington, d.c. crowd. thomas franklin and sally hayes sit at a table, drinks in front of them.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{... it didn't make any sense to me at all. i didn't know what the hell he was talking about...}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{he wasn't making a speech to us, tom he was talking to the masses. he was very clever, keeping it at a third grade level that's what they understand...}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{yeah? well, i don't understand what was up his sleeve when he pulled that stunt with us? what was he doing? and why?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{who knows...? maybe the government had something to do with it.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{you know, sally i really feel like i've been had, and you know what that means, don't you?... it means that any political future i had is right down the toilet!}
<A>__{the camera begins to slowly move away from the table, the sound of franklin's voice continues.}
<C>__{franklin }
<D>__{... jesus, the thought of spending the rest of my life as an attorney, that is really a downer... and, christ, sally, i almost forgot johanna is starting to think something's going on between...}
<A>__{franklin's voice fades into the background hubbub. the voice of kinney, the research assistant from the washington post is heard as the camera settles on a table occupied by sidney courtney and his staff.}
<C>__{kinney}
<D>__{... sid, be reasonable i've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!}
<C>__{courtney}
<D>__{try again.}
<C>__{kinney}
<D>__{sure, try again where? there's nothing, it's like he never existed!}
<C>__{courtney}
<D>__{try again.}
<C>__{kinney}
<D>__{sid, it's useless!}
<C>__{courtney}
<D>__{i said try again.}
<A>__{kinney stands, shoves his paperwork across the table.}
<C>__{kinney}
<D>__{up yours, sid. you try again, i quit!}
