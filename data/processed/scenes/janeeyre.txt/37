<A>__{st john is praying over jane, diana and mary as they sit at the table. mary catches jane's eye, gives her shy smile.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{join me to thyself with an inseparable band of love... for thou, even thou alone, dost satisfy him that loveth thee...}
<A>__{jane finds herself staring at st john, who prays ardently.}
<C>__{st john }
<D>__{and without thee all things are vain and empty. amen.}
<A>__{st john opens his eyes and looks searchingly at jane. she immediately looks down.}
<D>__{jane, mary, diana amen.}

<D>__{you're not fit enough to work.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{my sisters have always taken pleasure in keeping injured birds but i'm more inclined to put you in a way of keeping yourself and shall endeavour to do so, if that's what you wish.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{with all my heart, sir.}
<C>__{diana}
<D>__{it's a shame she has no choice of helpers, st john, and must put up with such crusty people as you.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{this school you were at, miss elliot, this charitable institution; what did it prepare you for?}
