<A>__{rave music blares. tom stands off to the side looking miserable. summer is on the dance floor. though she's not really dancing with anyone in particular, she's dancing with everyone. finally she comes over, white shirt dripping with sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or another.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{you're not having any fun.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you're having enough for both of us.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i'm dancing. i haven't danced in ages. god. come on.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{come on! i wanna dance with you.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{where were you an hour ago? i might have danced then. i've been standing here by myself this whole time and you didn't look over once.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{so you're pissed?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i'm not pissed. summer... you know i hate this shit.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{then why are you here?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this is what you wanted to do so...we're doing it.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{yeah well, i didn't need a chaperone. go home. you're a buzzkill standing there pouting.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{that's real nice.}
<A>__{he walks off. she feels some guilt for a second.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{tom!}
<A>__{but when he doesn't turn around she just shakes it off and starts dancing again. later. tom is outside in the rain. we can still hear the music blaring from the club. summer is in there. tom is alone. he can't believe it's come to this.
