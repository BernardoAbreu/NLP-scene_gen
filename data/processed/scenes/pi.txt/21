<L>__{interior max's apartment day}
<A>__{max draws spirals all over his wall street journal. then he takes a thick black marker and draws a giant spiral across the entire page. max is ecstatic as he pounds code into the computer takes moments to wake up, drops pills, and drinks a ginseng soda.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{simple shapes! tuesday, september second. twenty twenty two. sol! sol! sol! shapes in the market. why not? and they're spirals! spirals!}
<A>__{max traces a big circle on the journal. then, he cuts it out with an x acto blade. he cuts out the middle of the circle so that be has a thin loop like one of those futuristic frisbees. he tears part of the loop and stretches the circle out in front of him into a spiral.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{a circle spread out overtime. it's open ended. it has a beginning and it grows and changes through time. if i can find where it fits, if i can spin it and lock it into a group of numbers, then i can calculate the future. lead into gold. chaos into order madness into sanity. pain into bliss. perfection.}
<A>__{max is about to slap return but he stops himselfhe's nervous. next door, devi and her boyfriend are making love. he looks at the wall with disdain. then he looks back at the screen, shrugs and confidently slaps return on his keyboard. stock prices float across the screen. max can't believe his eyesthe quotes are absurd.}

<A>__{and then, euclid crashes. the electricity in max's room flips off. the numbers on max's screen fade to black. in near (minus streetlights) darkness:}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{shit!}
<B>__{tight on a fuse box}
<A>__{max removes a fuse. he replaces it with a penny. max's room max tries to reboot euclid, but nothing happens. he tries a second time, but nothing happens. devi and farrouhk are still at it. max puts on a pair of latex gloves. he dons a surgical mask. he climbs up to a loft above his monitors. a glass case, fed cool air by a vent tube, encases some computer parts. he carefully removes the front glass cover. then he gets it off he's stunned. not only have the chips melted down, but a strange flaky substance covers the board.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what the...}
<A>__{max grabs his face, frustrated. deri and farroakk are giggling, having a great time. max stares at the wall. then he angrily throws euclid's mainframe onto the ground it lands with a smash! under the mainframe is a small city of ants. they scramble for cover. max furiously attacks them, stomping them out with his bands. then he jumps on the smashed mainframe. he slides to the ground and covers his face.}
