<L>__{121: ext interior the ross residence. living room. day.}
<A>__{lights glow on the christmas tree. unopened presents still und erneath. serato sits smoking in silence. listens to a sound of plates getting stacked in another room. he looks up but not in surprise. he just wasn't aware berlin had arrived in the house.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{where's margie?}
<A>__{stunned and stubbled and full of grief. and that's just serato.}
<C>__{serato}
<D>__{taken bobby to her sister's ..}
<A>__{this atmosphere is unbearable and even these whispers seem laud.}
<D>__{they were going there anyway.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{does he know?}
<A>__{serato shakes his head. loses his cigarette. and sammy appears.}
<C>__{serato}
<D>__{thinks his dad's in hospital.}
<A>__{sammy serato is 30 and pretty. she continues collecting plates.}
<D>__{why'd you go up there, john?}
<A>__{knows he's not going to get a reply and doesn't bother to wait for it. helena materializes from the den like a shadow. sallow for want of sleep and glad to have berlin's hand to hang on to.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i want you to go to your aunt's.}
<A>__{a suggestion that surprises helena. and clearly doesn't appeal.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{why can't i stay with you?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{it's not possible right now.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{please don't ask no quest ions now .. not right now ..}
<A>__{if silence can intensify it's now. sound of the front door and then footsteps. berlin freezes as margie appears. wracked with grief. dead sickness of tears. like she cried bones out of her face. but no weeping now. maybe shock. maybe brave. maybe both.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{is that margie?}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{i'm here, honey. i'm right here.}
<A>__{the strongest face in the house. and now helena is in her arms.}
<D>__{don't cry darlin .. he was a big old cop and he didn't like tears ..}
<A>__{dead echos of plates in the kitchen. and song of birds outside.}
<D>__{feels like every second in my life, was just the moment leading to this.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{margie ..}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{don't.}
<A>__{raises her hand to silence him and this is silence margie owns.}
<D>__{don't.}
<A>__{christ this is just awful. helena crying and berlin on the way.}
<D>__{what's gonna happen now, john?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{she has an aunt, in vermont. i will take her there tonight.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i'm going back to the institute.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{no .. not now ..}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{helena can stay here if she'd like to .. i'd like her to .. i will look after her .. and she can look after me .. i'm tired now .. i must sleep ..}
<A>__{footsteps again as she walks out and silence again like before.}
