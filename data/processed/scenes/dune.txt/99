<A>__{outside in the passageway, feet suddenly move quietly toward the door to jessica's room.}
<L>__{92. interior jessica's chamber arrakeen palace day}
<A>__{jessica hears this and looks up just as the shadout mapes silently enters her room.}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(staring at the blue eyed woman waiting for possible danger.)}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{shadout mapes}
<D>__{i am the shadout mapes, your housekeeper, noble born. what are your orders.}
<C>__{jessica}

<C>__{mapes}
<P>__{(strangely asked)}
<D>__{you know the ancient tongues?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{i know the bhotani jib and chakobsa, all the hunting languages.}
<C>__{mapes}
<D>__{as the legend says.}
<C>__{jessica}

<A>__{mapes takes a step backward to flee.}
<C>__{jessica }
<D>__{i know many things. i know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice.}
<A>__{ }
<C>__{mapes}
<D>__{my lady, i... the weapon was sent as a gift if you should prove to be the one.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{and the means of my death should i prove otherwise.}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{now we will see which way the decision tips.}
<A>__{slowly mapes reaches into her dress and brings out a sheathed knife. she unleashes it.}
<C>__{mapes}
<D>__{do you know this my lady?}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{it could only be one thing....}
<P>__{(out loud)}
<D>__{it's a crysknife.}
<C>__{mapes}
<D>__{say it not lightly...}
<P>__{(very slowly)}
<D>__{do you know its meaning?}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{here is why this fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. shadout is chakobsa... knife, in chakobsa is... maker of death.}

<C>__{mapes}
<D>__{my lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.}
<A>__{mapes sheathes the blade... slowly }
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{there's more here... yes!}
<P>__{(out loud)}
<D>__{mapes, you've sheathed that blade unblooded.}
<A>__{with a gasp mapes drops the knife into jessica's hands and opens her blouse.}
<C>__{mapes}
<D>__{take the water of my life!}
<A>__{jessica withdraws the knife from the sheath and, with the blade, scratches a line just above mapes' right breast.}
<C>__{mapes }
<D>__{you are ours.... you are the one.}
<A>__{jessica's eyes stare ahead. she knows these words ring with truth.}
