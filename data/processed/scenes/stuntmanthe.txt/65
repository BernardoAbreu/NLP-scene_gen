<L>__{60 pov thru camera}
<A>__{through the camera, we see the 'arm' protruding from the sand. we hear o.s. voices yelling: "turning"... "speed"... "action." we see the fingers begin to move spasmodically. eli's voice yells: "okay, raymond!" suddenly the fingers on the hand start to swell, bigger and bigger...like a rubber glove filling with air...then bang! bang! bang! the (balloon covered) fingers explode.}
<L>__{61 angle on beach}
<A>__{everyone has broken up with laughter at the prank, including eli. gabe is patting eli's face, raymond squeezing his jaw affectionately as one would a pet dog's.}
<C>__{raymond}
<P>__{(cackling)}
<D>__{gotcha that time! didn't we?}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(through his laughter)}
<D>__{yeah, you got me another half hour behind.}
<A>__{eli climbs to his feet as the laughter subsides. cameron, now wearing a uniform exactly like raymond's, watches from the sidelines.}
<C>__{raymond}
<P>__{(gently, grinning)}
<D>__{thought the chief could use a little cheering up today.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(turning quiet and serious)}
<D>__{...so you heard the news about burt...}
<C>__{raymond}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{any more word?}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{afraid not...there's no picture ever made that's worth it.}
<C>__{raymond}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{i will never understand why these guys do it take the chances.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{don't know. trying to beat the system, i guess...we all know that some day we're gonna die of nothing more important than wrinkles...and that makes us so scared and crazy, we'll do anything. go off bridges...fight windmills...wars... anything.}
<A>__{there is great sadness among them. eli breaks the mood lightly.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{that's what our film's about or didn't you know?}
<P>__{(sees cameron)}
<D>__{hey, burt, come over here.}
<A>__{cameron crosses to them. he and raymond stand appraising each other, red haired men in identical uniforms. as raymond offers his hand:}
<C>__{raymond}
<P>__{(to eli)}
<D>__{my new cock and balls?}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{not new...it's important not to let that get around as yet. so, for the time being, let's make like he's the same guy.}
<P>__{(adding a touch of color)}
<D>__{but no longer known as "bad assed burt." ever since his 'fortunate rescue,'...we call him "lucky."}
