<A>__{truman enters the garage, carrying sylvia's sweater. he breathes in the scent one last time and reluctantly replaces it in the trunk. with a sense of finality, he lowers the lid and fastens the lock.}

<A>__{truman emerges from the garage, wheeling his lawnmower, deliberately averting his eyes from the back of the house. staring out of the kitchen window, a tall glass of iced tea in her hand, meryl has been anticipating her husband's appearance. she wears a neckbrace, we sense more as a reminder to truman than for any benefit she might derive. feeling meryl's eyes burning into his back, truman fires up the mower and heads directly towards the symbolically uncut section of grass. we focus on the errant blades of grass as they are severed by the mower. the lawn is now uniformly trimmed. from a mechanical platform above the expressway, christof and chloe watch truman's final act of defiance laid to rest.}
