<T>__{fade in:}
<B>__{a tenement hotel}
<A>__{on the lower east side. we can faintly hear the cry of the fishmongers. it is too early for us to hear traffic; later, perhaps, we will.}
<B>__{back to barton}
<A>__{looking down at the page. close on barton's feet swinging in the legwell. one foot idly swings over to nudge a pair of nicely shined shoes from where they rest, under the secretary, into the legwell. we hear typing start.}
<B>__{the page}
<A>__{a new paragraph being started: "a large man..." barton's feet as he slides them into the shoes.}
<B>__{the page}
<A>__{"a large man in tights..." the typing stops.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{looking quizzically at the page. what's wrong?}
<B>__{his feet}
<A>__{sliding back and forth swimming in his shoes, which are several sizes too large. we hear a knock at the door.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{he rises and answers the door. charlie stands smiling in the doorway, holding a pair of nicely shined shoes.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i hope these are your shoes.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{hi, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{because that would mean they gave you mine.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{yeah, as a matter of fact they did. come on in.}
<A>__{the two stocking footed men go into the room and barton reaches under the secretary for charlie's shoes.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{jesus, what a day i've had. ever had one of those days?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{seems like nothing but, lately.}
<A>__{chalrie perches on the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{jesus, what a day. felt like i couldn't've sold ice water in the sahara. jesus. okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. but god, people can be rude. feel like i have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well, my pleasure. i could use a little lift myself.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{a little lift, yeah...}
<A>__{smiling, he takes out his flask.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...good thing they bottle it, huh pal?}
<A>__{he takes a glass from the bedstand and, as he pours barton a shot:}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...did i say rude? people can be goddamn cruel. especially some of their housewives. okay, so i've got a weight problem. that's my cross to bear. i dunno...}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well it's... it's a defense mechanism.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{defense against what? insurance? something they need? something they should be thanking me for offering? a little peace of mind?...}
<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...finally decided to knock off early, take your advice. went to see a doctor about this.}
<A>__{he indicates his ear, still stuffed with cotton.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...he told me it was an ear infection. ten dollars, please. i said, hell, i told you my ear was infected. why don't you give me ten dollars? well, that led to an argument...}
<A>__{he gives a rueful chuckle.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...listen to me belly achin'. as if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. how goes the life of the mind?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well, it's been better. i can't seem to get going on this thing. that one idea, the one that lets you get started i still haven't gotten it. maybe i only had one idea in me my play. maybe once that was done, i was done being a writer. christ, i feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{those two love birds next door drivin' you nuts?}
<A>__{barton looks at him curiously.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{how did you know about that?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{know about it? i can practically see how they're doin' it. brother, i wish i had a piece of that.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{yeah, but}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{seems like i hear everything that goes on in this dump. pipes or somethin'. i'm just glad i don't have to ply my trade in the wee wee hours.}
<A>__{he laughs.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. you've got a head on your shoulders. what is it they say? where there's a head, there's a hope?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{where there's life there's hope.}
<A>__{charlie laughs.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that proves you really are a writer!}
<A>__{barton smiles.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{and there's hope for you too, charlie. tomorrow i bet you sell a half dozen policies.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{thanks, brother. but the fact is, i gotta pull up stakes temporarily.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{you're leaving?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{in a few days. out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact new york city. things have gotten all balled up at the head office.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i'm truly sorry to hear that, charlie. i will miss you.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face! this is still home for me i keep my room, and i will be back sooner or later...}
<A>__{barton rises and walks over to his writing table.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...and mark my words by the time i get back you're picture'll be finished. i know it.}
<A>__{barton scribbles on a notepad and turns to hand it to charlie.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{new york can be pretty cruel to strangers, charlie. if you need a home cooked meal you just look up morris and lillian fink. they live on fulton street with my uncle dave.}
<A>__{we hear a tacky, tearing sound. barton looks toward the door. charlie rises and walks over to the stand next to where barton sits. the two staring men form an odd, motionless tableau the slight, bespectacled man seated; the big man standing in a hunch with his hands on his thighs; their heads close together.}
<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{a swath of wallpaper in the entryway has pulled away from the wall. it sags and nods.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{christ!}
<B>__{the two men}
<A>__{frozen, looking.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...your room does that too?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what a dump...}
<A>__{he heads for the door and barton follows.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...i guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well it's pathetic, isn't it? i mean to a guy from new york.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{this kind of heat. it's pathetic.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well, i guess you pick your poison.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{so they say.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{course not, compadre. you'll see me again.}
<A>__{barton closes the door. he goes back to the desk, sits, and stares at the typewriter. after a beat he tips back in his chair and looks up at the ceiling. we hear a loud thump.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the ceiling a white, seamless space. as we track in the thumping continues slowly, rhythmically, progressively louder the effect, it seems, of odd doings upstairs.}
<B>__{looking down on barton}
<A>__{from a high angle, tipped back in his chair, staring at the ceiling. we track slowly down toward him. the thumping continues, growing louder, sharper.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{moving in on the ceiling. we close in on an unblemished area and cease to have any sense of movement. with a blur something huge and dark sweeps across the frame to land with a deafening crash, and an instant later it is gone, having left a huge black "t" stamped into the white ceiling. we are pulling back from the white, past the metal prongs of the key strike area on a typewriter. more letters appear rapid fire, growing smaller as the pull back continues. the thumpimg becomes the clacking of the typewriter.}
<B>__{ben geisler}
<A>__{is emerging from his office. as he enters the secretary stops typing, glances down at a slip of paper, and murmurs tonelessly, without looking up:}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{barton fink.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{yeah. fink. come in.}
<A>__{the clack of the typewriter resumes as barton rises. geisler's office the two men enter. this office is considerably smaller than lipnik's, done in grays and black. there are pictures on the wall of geisler with various celebrities. geisler sits behind his desk.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{wuddya got for me what the hell happened to your face?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{nothing. it's just a mosquito bite.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in los angeles. mosquitos breed in swamps this is a desert town. wuddya got for me?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well i...}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{on the beery picture! where are we? wuddya got?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well, to tell you the truth, i'm having some trouble getting started}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{getting started! christ jesus! started?! you mean you don't have anything?!}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well not much.}
<A>__{geisler leaps to his feet and paces.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{what do you think this is? hamlet? gone with the wind? ruggles of red gap? it's a goddamn b picture! big men in tights! you know the drill!}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i'm afraid i don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob }
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{understand shit! i though you were gonna consult another writer on this!}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well, i've talked to bill mayhew }
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{bill mayhew! some help! the guy's a souse!}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{he's a great writer}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{a souse!}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{you don't understand. he's in pain, because he can't write }
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{souse! souse! he manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{but... i thought no one cared about this picture.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{you thought! where'd you get that from? you thought! i don't know what the hell you said to lipnik, but the sonofabitch likes you! you understand that, fink? he likes you! he's taken an interest. never make lipnik like you. never!}
<A>__{some puzzlement shows through barton's weariness.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i don't understand }
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{are you deaf, he likes you! he's taken an interest! what the hell did you say to him?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i didn't say anything }
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{well he's taken an interest! that means he'll make your life hell, which i could care less about, but since i drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! fat assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going don't worry, i covered for you. told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. i told him it was great, so now my ass is on the line. he wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i can't write anything by tomorrow.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{who said write? jesus, jack can't read. you gotta tell it to him tell him something for chrissake.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well what do i tell him?}
<A>__{geisler rubs a temple, studies barton for a beat, then picks up a telephone.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{projection...}
<A>__{as he waits, geisler gives barton a withering stare. it continues throughout the phone conversation.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{... jerry? ben geisler here. any of the screening rooms free this afternoon?... good, book it for me. a writer named fink is gonna come in and you're gonna show him wrestling pictures... i don't give a shit which ones! wrestling pictures! wait a minute isn't victor sjoderberg shooting one now?... show him some of the dailies on that.}
<A>__{he slams down the phone.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{...this ought to give you some ideas.}
<A>__{he jots an address on a piece of paper and hands it to barton.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{...eight fifteen tomorrow morning at lipnik's house. ideas. broad strokes. don't cross me, fink.}
<B>__{screen}
<A>__{black and white footage. a middle aged man with a clapstick enters and shouts:}
<C>__{clapper}
<D>__{devil on the canvas, twelve baker take one.}
<A>__{clap! the clapper withdraws. the angle is on a corner of the ring, where an old corner man stands behind his charge, a huge man in tights who is a little too flabby to be a real athlete. his hair is plastered against his bullet skull and he has a small mustache.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{action.}
<A>__{the wrestler rises from his stool and heads toward center ring and the camera. he affects a german accent:}

<C>__{wrestler}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{i will destroy him!... i will destroy him!... i will destroy him!... i will destroy him!...}
<A>__{another off microphone, distant voice from the screen:}

<D>__{okay, take five...}
<B>__{the screen}
<A>__{a jerky pan, interrupted by flash frames. the wrestler is standing in a corner joking with a makeup girl who pats down his face as he smokes a cigarette. a cut in the film and another clapstick enters.}
