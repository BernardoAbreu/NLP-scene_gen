<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior temple day}
<A>__{indy, sallah, henry and brody creep forward to see:}
<B>__{the terrified face of a turkish soldier}
<A>__{he's walking slowly. eyes darting. muttering a prayer under his breath. what's going on here? full shot inside the mountain temple the turk stands alone in the center of the temple. it is very dark. giant columns define the temple's perimeter.}
<B>__{elsa and donovan}
<A>__{watch him from a safe distance.}
<B>__{the turk}
<A>__{is about to approach the spot where a turkish soldier lies dead. we don't notice it right away, but the dead soldier has been decapitated. the turk stopsonly one step away from the beheaded soldier.}
<B>__{the turk}
<A>__{takes one more stepa fatal step, it turns out. we hear a roara whoosh of airbut we see nothingexcept the turk's head fly off and bounce across the ground. indy, henry, brody and sallah react to the sight.}
<B>__{elsa and donovan}
<A>__{she looks at him, horrified.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{helmut, another volunteer!}
<A>__{two nazi soldiers force another turk forward. suddenly... the sound of rifle bolts being cocked. everyone turns to discover indy and his party surrounded by nazi soldiers. indy's group are relieved of their guns. full shot the temple indy, henry, brody and sallah are brought forward by the nazi soldiers. elsa's eyes light up: glad indy's not dead. she controls herself and continues more coldly.}
<C>__{elsa}
<P>__{(to indy)}
<D>__{i never expected to see you again.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i'm like a bad penny. i always turn up.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{step back now, doctor schneider. give doctor jones some room. he's going to recover the grail for us.}
<A>__{indy laughs.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{impossible? what do you say, jones? ready to go down in history?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{as what? a nazi stooge like you?}
<C>__{donovan}
<P>__{(scornfully)}
<D>__{nazis?!is that the limit of your vision?! the nazis want to write themselves into the grail legend and take on the world. well, they're welcome. but i want the grail itself. the cup that gives everlasting life. hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. i'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the dodo.}
<P>__{(he draws his pistol)}
<D>__{the grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{shooting me won't get you anywhere.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{you know something, doctor jones?... you're absolutely right.}
<A>__{then donovan shifts his aim, just a bit, and shoots henry. the bullet enters his side below the ribs.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{dad?!}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{junior. . .}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{no!!}
<C>__{donovan}
<P>__{( to elsa)}
<D>__{get back!}
<A>__{henry collapses. blood flowing from the wound. brody and sallah rush to his assistance. indy spins toward donovan with murder in his eyes. donovan points the gun at him:}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{you can't save him when you're dead.}
<A>__{indy hesitates.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{the healing power of the grail is the only thing that can save your father now. it's time to ask yourself what you believe.}
<A>__{indy takes in the situation. the two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of him. he walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. we get silent reaction shotselsasallahbrodydonovanregistering their different emotions indy proceeds forward. his hands open the grail diary.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{"the breath of god... only the penitent man will pass. only the penitent man will pass. . . "}
<A>__{indy takes a few steps forward.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{"the penitent man will pass. the penitent man..."}
<A>__{indy stops. he is about to reach the spot where two men have just died. henry looks at indy. indy looks at henry.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(in a raspy voice)}
<D>__{"only the penitent man will pass. only the penitent man will pass."}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(quietly to himself)}
<D>__{the penitent man will pass. the penitent... the penitent. the penitent man...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{the penitent man. the penitent...}
<A>__{indy takes a step forward through the cobwebs.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{the penitent man is humble before god.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{penitent. penitent...}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{the penitent man is humble...}
<A>__{the cobwebs begin to move....}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{he kneels before god.}
<P>__{(to himself; suddenly)}
<D>__{kneel!!}
<A>__{we hear the awful rush of airwhoosh! because indy is in the act of kneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face. instinctively he rolls forward on the ground out of harm's way and looks up. from his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: a razor}
<B>__{sharp triple pendulum.}
<A>__{indy gets cautiously to his feet. now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a small corridor which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead. wooden wheels turnthe mechanism controlling the spinning blades. indy loops a rope around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid swipe.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i'm through!}
<B>__{elsa and donovan}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{we're through!}
<A>__{brody and sallah smile, relieved.}
<C>__{sallah}
<P>__{(to henry)}
<D>__{he's all right.}
<A>__{henry shakes his head.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{no.}
<B>__{back to indy}
<A>__{holding the grail diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{"the second challenge is the word of god. only in the footsteps of god will he proceed."}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{the word of god... the word of...}
<A>__{indy pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. each cobble is engraved with a letter.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{"proceed in the footsteps of the word."}
<B>__{henry}
<A>__{lifts his head painfully.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{the word of god...}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{no, henry. try not to talk.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{the name of god...}
<B>__{back to indy}
<A>__{as he studies the cobblestones before him.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{the name of god... jehovahl}
<B>__{henry}
<A>__{still lies in sallah's arms. brody leans over him.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{but in the latin alphabet, "jehovah" begins with an "i."}
<B>__{back to indy}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{"j."}
<A>__{indy takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and indy falls up to his hip his leg stuck through the hold where the stone once was.}
<B>__{henry}
<A>__{reacts.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{oh dear!}
<B>__{back to indy}
<A>__{who grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, the v rail diary in his hand.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{in latin, "jehovah" starts with an "i." "i"...}
<A>__{now we see each letter on the stones as indy carefully walks forward. donovan and elsa follow in his footsteps.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{"e"... "h"... "o"... "v"... "a"...}
<A>__{indy sighs with relief and steps forward to:}
<B>__{the great abyss}
<A>__{indy stands in a small opening, just small enough for his shoulders to squeeze through and beyond that a 100 foot drop to the rocks below and 100 feet across, nothing but a rough, stony cliff wall.}
<B>__{back to indy}
<A>__{he can see nowhere to cross. he looks again to the v rail diary.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{"the path of flood. only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."}
<A>__{indy looks around and then he notices that inscribed into the rock above his head is the head of a lion.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{impossiblel nobody can jump this!}
<A>__{indy looks down into the diary and tortures over what it is asking him to do.}
<B>__{brody}
<A>__{rushes forward and calls to indy.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{indy... indy, you must hurry!! come quickly!}
<B>__{back to indy}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{it's... a leap of faith. oh, god.}
<B>__{henry}
<A>__{calls to his son.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you must believe, boy. you must... believe.}
<A>__{we see him do it. we see him leap into space. we see that he is in midair. we see that he is not going to make it. his hands claw for the opposite wall but he is going to fall 100 feet to his death. and thenhe doesn't! he appears to be held up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees. indy looks around and down and now he figures it out. ingeniously, the first crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks}
