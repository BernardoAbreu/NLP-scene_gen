<L>__{interior courtroom later}
<A>__{cardenas stands before roston a handsome man with salt and pepper hair in his late fifties.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{mr. roston, what was your relationship with miss lawson?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{we were lovers.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{how long were you together?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{for about one year.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{how would you describe your sex life with miss lawson?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{intense.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{i know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{it was wild. she was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up kinky things. i tried to satisfy her the best i could, but it was difficult in my condition.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what kind of condition are you referring to?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{i had a bad heart.}
<A>__{there is an audible gasp from the crowd. cardenas waits, giving the jury plenty of time to digest the implications of roston's last statement. dulaney looks at rebecca dumbfounded. he tries to control his surprise from the eyes of the jury, but he can't. he stares ahead with a blank expression as he listens to the rest of the testimony.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what happened next?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{i had bypass surgery.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{and how are you now?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{fine. the doctors say if i keep taking care of myself i can live to be a very old man.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{how did your relationship with miss lawson progress after the surgery?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{it didn't.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{she left me.}
<A>__{dulaney slowly turns and looks at rebecca. the anger and his sense of betrayal show on his face.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{why did she say she was leaving?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{she didn't. she just left.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{why do you think she left you?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{well i think that after the operation she realized that...}
<A>__{it takes dulaney a few seconds to object to the question. he is clearly preoccupied with the implications of roston's testimony.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{objection. the question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{your honor, mr. roston lived with the defendant for many months. i feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the miss lawson.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{the opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{objection sustained.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{did miss lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{objection. the witness has already stated that miss lawson left without an explanation.}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{mr. cardenas, i suggest you move on to another line of questioning.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{when you say your sexual relations with miss lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{it was like she was trying to push me as far as she could. she called it opening new doors.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{can you give the court an example?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{it was like sex was a game to her. she got off on the control. she always used to tell me it had to be her way.}
<A>__{this strikes a chord with dulaney.}
<C>__{roston}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what would she do that made it hard to resist?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{she's a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality. sometimes i felt she could read my mind. it was uncanny how she knew exactly what i wanted. a few nights before my heart surgery rebecca woke me. she had handcuffed me to the bed.}
<A>__{there are a few snickers from the crowd. dulaney is thinking about the familiarity of roston's testimony. judge burnham bangs his gavel. the crowd becomes silent.}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{she told me that tonight we were going to open new doors. i asked her to stop to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what did she say?}
<A>__{roston is clearly uncomfortable having to relate this part of his life.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{mr. roston i know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{she said she was going to fuck me like i've never been fucked before.}
<A>__{more noise from the crowd. judge burnham is annoyed. he bangs his gavel again.}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{due to the sensitive nature of this witness' testimony and the inability of the spectators to allow him to complete it, i am clearing the courtroom.}
<A>__{sounds of protest fill the room as the bailiffs start to usher out the crowd.}
