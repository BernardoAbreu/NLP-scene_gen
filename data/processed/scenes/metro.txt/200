<D>__{oh, shit...}
<A>__{he moves the scope ahead of roper, seeing korda's shadow cast on the floor, still unable to see him.}
<C>__{mccall}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{all right, scott, bring him out.}
<L>__{interior machine shop day}
<A>__{roper growing closer to korda's position.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{that's far enough. bag on the floor.}
<A>__{roper hangs onto the bag there's 'four million in jewels' in there all he has to bargain with.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i've kept my end. ronnie first.}
<A>__{korda reacts in mock surprise.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{oh, shit, in all the excitement i almost forgot. she right here...}
<A>__{a light switch is thrown, a bank of lights behind him coming on, illuminating a massive flat bed circular lathe. roper's eyes in horror go to...}
<B>__{ronnie}
<A>__{tied to the lathe bed spread eagle. some distance from her body a cutting device is positioned over the lathe bed. roper looks into ronnie's terrified eyes.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{be cool, ronnie, i'm gonna get you out of this.}
<A>__{he turns back, korda grinning at him.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{no shit, this i gotta see...}
<A>__{korda swings into position a control box, the buttons held down with tape. korda pulls free the tape, the huge lathe beginning to turn, very slowly, the cutting device activated... if the table keeps turning, ronnie's body will soon be under the blade. (production note: lathe will be cutting into a section of steel plate, demonstrating what will happen to ronnie. korda presses the stop button, the lathe stopping. he releases his finger again, the lathe turning. he stops it. we can see that korda is immensely proud of his 'creation', his focus more on sadistic payback than anything else at this pointerior}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{fuckin' cool, huh? i rewired the switch. you see, you have to keep your finger on the button or the little lady gets cut...}
<A>__{he releases the button, the lathe turning towards the cutting device. he stops it again, holding the button.}
<C>__{korda}
<P>__{(continuing; grins)}
<D>__{right in half.}
<A>__{he eases towards roper, extending his arm on the control box, holding the button down.}
