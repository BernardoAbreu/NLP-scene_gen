<D>__{is there anything wrong, miss tompkins?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{uh miss tompkins isn't here.}
<A>__{bartholomew comes to the door and looks in. he is a pale grey haired man who looks, on first examination, older than his forty odd years. sickly would be the word that describes him best pallid, consumptive looking. he wears heavy tortoise framed glasses which fall down his nose and cause him to push them back in place every so often with a quick automatic motion.}
<C>__{bartholomew}
<D>__{i'm sorry my secretary must have gone to lunch. you are ?}
<C>__{reggie}
<D>__{mrs. lampert mrs. charles lampert.}
