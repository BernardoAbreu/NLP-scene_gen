<L>__{interior soda shop.}
<A>__{the place is just sad. all the remnants of what they had are strewn around the floor, the jukebox is turned over. the stools are ripped out of the floor. betty looks over at the corner where he painted her ... the easel is smashed to bits.}
<B>__{angle. betty.}
<A>__{she brings a knuckle to her lip and david puts an arm around her and draws her close. after a moment or two they hear a weird scraping sound.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{the scraping sound stops. they all look to the open door and after a second or two, mr. johnson appears holding a broom and dustpan.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{just thought i'd try to tidy it up a bit.}
<A>__{betty runs across and throws her arms around him. the teenagers watch as she holds him tight.}
<C>__{mr. johnson }
<D>__{it's okay. once we sweep it up it'll be alright again ...}
<A>__{betty stifles a sob as he strokes her hair. no one says anything while they just embrace for a moment. finally ...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well he's right. come on. let's turn these booths back up. "mary sue", why don't you help me slide this in front of the door. we'll be okay in here.}
<A>__{they respond to the tone of leadership. one by one the kids start to pitch in, sifting their way through the wreckage. jennifer and david slide a barricade in front of the door as the kids try to put their shop back together.}
