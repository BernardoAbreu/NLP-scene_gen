<A>__{jack, bunny and tooth arrive gracefully in the warren's antechamber, while north and the yetis comes to a crashing halt.}

<C>__{north}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{"buckle up." is very funny.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{welcome to the warren }
<A>__{bunny stands before them when suddenly, he shifts his attention. he turns, his ears perk up and his nose sniffs the air.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{something's up.}
<A>__{something's amiss. a faint scream begins to echo from within the depths of one of bunny's egg tunnels. tiny eggs come scuttling out from the tunnel. bunny grabs his boomerang, north draws his sword, and jack readies his staff as the sounds of booming footsteps, screams, and the rustling of foliage grows louder.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{ahhhh!}
<A>__{bunny begins to charge toward the tunnel. at his side are the guardians, yetis, and sentinel eggs all bellowing their loudest battle cries until...sophie bursts out. all momentum comes to a halt.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sophie?}
<A>__{they immediately withdraw their weapons, mildly embarrassed. sophie giggles and immediately runs after one of the elves.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{elf, elf, elf!}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{what is she doing here!!?}
<A>__{north looks down at his coat pocket ooops.}
<C>__{north}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{ah, snow globe.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{crikey! somebody do something!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't look at me, i'm invisible, remember? guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 80.}
<A>__{sophie giggles as she drags the elf by the bell atop its uniform.}
<C>__{tooth}
<P>__{(confident)}
<D>__{don't worry, bunny. i bet she's a fairy fan.}
<P>__{(flies up to sophie)}
<D>__{it's okay little one.}
<C>__{sophie}
<P>__{(to tooth)}
<D>__{pretty!}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{awww! you know what, i got something for you. here it is.}
<P>__{(she pulls something out)}
<D>__{look at all the pretty teeth with little blood and gum on them.}
<A>__{sophie runs away screaming.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{blood and gums? when was the last time you guys actually hung out with kids?}
<A>__{meanwhile, sophie is running around the warren, exploring and playing. sophie pokes her head into a small tunnel.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{peek a boo.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{we are very busy bringing joy to children! we don't have time...}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{...for children.}
<A>__{jack walks toward her, forming a snowflake, which floats over toward sophie. she tries to grab at it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{if one little kid can ruin easter, then...we're in worse shape than i thought.}
<A>__{sophie follows the snowflake as jack leads it over to bunny.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{weeee! weee, weee, weee! guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 81.}
<A>__{the snowflake lands on bunny's nose and his concerns suddenly seem to slip away. jack's magic is taking affect.}
