<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{so what do you think of the plan, mr. kumar?}
<A>__{kumar shrugs. pause.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{we'd love to have you on the team.}
<A>__{kumar nods. he looks at a plant growing by the window. silence.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{what is that? an orchid?}
<A>__{kumar shakes his head. sighs deeply. long pause. kumar suddenly stands up and unbuttons his shirt. he throws it on the bed. he undoes his trousers and takes them off. anthony looks at dignan. kumar takes off his socks, then his shorts. he is naked. he walks over to his dresser and takes out a small satchell. he looks around the room. right at anthony. he walks quickly toward him. anthony gets nervous. kumar grabs anthony's shoulder and lifts him up a little. he pulls a towel out from underneath anthony. he puts his hand on dignan's shoulder as he walks to the door, into the hall.}
