<L>__{interior worthington house, living room day}
<A>__{camera follows homer into the worthington house where, from the front hall, he sees olive and candy (in profile) sitting on the couch. we can't see who's talking, nor do we recognize the voice. as homer comes into the living room, we see major winslow sitting in a chair (also in profile), talking to olive and candy. major winslow is a smooth, handsome well briefed officer in the casualty branch of the army air corps; he's done his homework, but he's not all business. he's painfully aware of the delicate nature of his report.}
<C>__{major winslow}
<D>__{when the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. the copilot jumped third. all on captain worthington's orders the captain was still flying the plane. none of the men of the ground could see the sky that's how thick the jungle was. they never saw the plane crash they never heard it crash. they never saw captain worthington's parachute, either.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{why was he missing for twenty days?}
<C>__{major winslow}
<D>__{because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. they were hospitalized for almost a week in china before they were flown back to india. it wasn't until that they sorted through their gear...}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{who cares about their gear?}
<C>__{major winslow}
<D>__{three men jumped from the plane, but they had four compasses with them. one of the crew jumped with captain worthington's compass.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{he was in burma for twenty days without a compass?}
<C>__{major winslow}
<D>__{he followed the irrawaddy river, all the way to rangoon. somehow he managed to avoid the japs, but not the mosquitoes.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{then it's malaria?}
<C>__{major winslow}
<D>__{it's encephalitis b. he's recovering at mount lavinia hospital, ceylon.}

<P>__{(olive gasps)}
<D>__{waist down. he won't walk.}
<A>__{candy stands and leaves the room.}

<P>__{(asks the major)}
