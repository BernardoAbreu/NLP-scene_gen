<L>__{interior casino blackjack table day}
<A>__{as cris signals for another card, two black suits appear behind him.}
<P>__{black suit (o.s.)}
<D>__{sir, would you come with us, please.}
<A>__{cris takes in their grim faces. turns to see two more pairs of goons stationed nearby.}
<D>__{snapback to:}
<A>__{thirty seconds ago the cocktail waitress approaches to take cris' order.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{what's your pleasure?}
<A>__{this time, cris hurriedly scoops all his chips into his coat pocket, jostling the waitress as he stands.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{scuse me, sorry.}
<A>__{hustling away, he glances back just as the first two black suits reach his stool, but this time it's empty. they look around. one of them whispers into his mike. the three pairs of goons get instructions and split up. tracking shot eye level cris strides crisply through the casino. sees another pair of black suits, scanning for him. he ducks into the maze of slots. zigs and zags from aisle to aisle, seemingly at random. a moment after each turn, a black suit appears ahead, behind, or to the side where they would have spotted cris. tracking shot high angle a clearer perspective as two black suits approach cris' aisle from different directions. cris has no way to see them or know they're coming, but at the last moment, he moves in between two aisles where neither guard will see him as they pass. surveillance room davis and hawkeye wince as the black suits keep missing their quarry.}
<D>__{davis what's wrong with you guys? hawkeye he's right next to you! aisle 63!}
<A>__{ferris watches the chase, fascinated. phalanxes of slot machines black suits converge from various directions, in that fake calm fast walk. cris studies the gamblers playing the machines nearby, then heads to a particular spot where he is sure to be spotted except that a texas sized man repositions himself, blocking the black suit's view. the black suit moves on. cris shifts to another spot just as a different black suit arrives at the other end of the aisle. this time, three frat boys change machines and obscure cris from his gaze. surveillance room davis is throwing a fit.}
<D>__{davis there! there! he's right there in front of you! walk toward each other!}
<A>__{cris slips away in the shadow of the frat boys.}
<D>__{hawkeye maybe he's on our frequency.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{i don't see an earphone on him. hawkeye he's heading to the convention annex.}
<C>__{ferris}
<P>__{(stands)}
<D>__{give me a headset. i'm going down there.}
<A>__{convention annex arriving at the foyer, cris sees five meeting rooms. he squints then decisively enters one of them. four black suits arrive an instant later. without wasting a beat, each of them goes through a different door. all except the one cris went through. cris re emerges a moment later and heads back toward the casino. casino ferris, arriving, adjusts her headset. cris sees her. recognizes her from his prevision as the woman on the plasma screen. turns and walks away. she sees cris. takes off after him.}
<D>__{ferris}
<P>__{(to head mic)}
<D>__{he's heading toward...}
<P>__{(reads sign)}
<D>__{the ipanema grill.}
<A>__{security staff converge on the area. cris is in plain sight. suddenly a busload of tourists surge in through a door and clog the way. cris continues into the... kitchen area passing a room service cart, he rolls it in front of him. a few steps on, he takes the bottle of olive oil on the cart and pours some in front of one random closed door. cris then shoves the room service cart down the hall toward an empty intersecting corridor. a black suit barrels into the empty intersection just as the cart arrives and tumbles over it. behind cris, a door swings open; a black suit charges out; steps precisely into the puddle of poured olive oil and falls on his ass. cris slips by him, but gets cut off by an arriving group of four more black suits. big guys. they try to grab him. he evades their grasp almost magically and, like a shaolin monk, somehow leverages them into each other until they are in a pile on the floor. cris darts around them into the... lobby he co opts a luggage cart that is loaded up for delivery. rolling it to the left, a black suit on that side doesn't see him and moves on. cris switches to the right side of the card just as a second black suit would have seen him. abandoning the cart, cris sets off across the lobby in a herky jerky rhythm. he walks four quick steps without being seen. then stops behind a column just as black suit 1 turns his way. when black suit 1 looks on, cris resumes his journey, cutting across the lobby at an acute angle. in this way, he avoids being seen by black suit 2. cris now backs up three steps and avoids being seen by black suit 3. by precisely choosing his movements and knowing where his hunters will be looking, cris achieves something like invisibility. the last obstacle to daylight is ferris. she sees him. he makes a run for the door. she dashes after him.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{you! i just need to talk to you!}
<A>__{cris grabs a guest's suitcase and keeps moving.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{homeland security!}
<A>__{the guest chases after cris and collides with ferris, knocking her to the ground. which allows cris to slip through a door to the... exterior hotel loading dock day where two laundry delivery men are flinging sacks of clothes into the back of a truck. cris steps toward the open tailgate with a steady pace. as if on cue, both laundry guys turn and bend to pick up another sack of clothes. cris walks right by them without being noticed and climbs into the truck. a moment later, the laundry guys pivot back around, toss sacks of clothes in after cris, and slam the rear doors. they get in the truck and drive off just as ferris, davis, and several black suits arrive to find a cold trail.}
<D>__{davis you were right. this guy is a lot more than lucky.}
<A>__{oddly, ferris seems almost encouraged.}
<D>__{ferris at least now i know he exists.}
