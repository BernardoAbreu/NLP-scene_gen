<L>__{interior carriage house day}
<A>__{light filters in through gaps in the wood. luke opens one of the main doors with a loud squeak, the sun revealing a tarp covered shape, a carriage. unused in a hundred years. a row of tarp covered carriages fill the stalls into the distance.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, this lot is full!}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{he must have left. didn't like the looks of the place or something.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{how could he have left without his keys?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{two sets. i don't know. maybe they're not even his.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{then he's got to be in the house...}
<A>__{as they leave, the camera lingers on a covered shape in one of the stalls, smaller than the other carriages, it could be a car. a broken wagon wheel leaning against it.}
