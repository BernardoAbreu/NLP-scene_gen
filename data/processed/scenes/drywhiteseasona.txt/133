<L>__{interior viljoen's office day}
<A>__{the colonel, amiable, cool, behind his desk. a dishev elled ben, pitched angrily forward in his chair.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{now you must be exaggerating, mr. du toit.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{my house has been searched. my phone is tapped. my mail is opened. and last night three shots were fired through my window close to killing my wife.}
<A>__{viljoen reacts.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{mr. du toit, if shots were fired into your premises, we will investigate.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{all i want to know, colonel, is why don't you leave me in peace?}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{now wait, wait a minute, mr. du toit, you're not trying to blame me?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{tell me, colonel, why is it so important to you people to stop my enquiries about gordon ngubene?}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{is that what you are doing?}
<P>__{(he pauses)}
<D>__{well, now. if you possess any information that may be of use to us, i trust you won't hesitate to discuss it with me.}
<A>__{he leans forward towards ben, his tone darkening.}
<C>__{viljoen}
<D>__{because if there are facts you are deliberately hiding from us, mr. du toit if you give us reason to believe that you may be involved in activities that may be dangerous to both yourself and us then i can foresee some problems.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{is that a threat, colonel?}
<C>__{viljoen}
<P>__{(smiling and sitting back)}
<D>__{let's call it a warning. a friendly warning. for god's sake, open your eyes, mr. du toit! don't you see you're being used!}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{by the communists, i suppose.}
<A>__{ben gets up to go. the colonel doesn't rise to see him out.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{goodbye, colonel.}
<P>__{(at the door, turning back)}
<D>__{i'm sure.}
