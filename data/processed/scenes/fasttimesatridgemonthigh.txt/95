<A>__{brad hamilton, looks terribly uncomfortable in his ponce de leon hat and buccaneer uniform. he rings up an order for an older customer.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{why aren't you in school, son?}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{i go to school in the mornings. i have a work study program for the afternoon.}
<A>__{he bags one final coffee and punches up the amount.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{$8.46, please.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{here you go. i have it exactly.}
<P>__{(sets money down)}
<D>__{good luck!}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{thank you, and thanks for coming to captain kidd.}
<A>__{brad loosens his buccaneer scarf, and starts back towards the kitchen. he is stopped by the sudden appearance of captain kidd assistant manager, harold.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{hamilton! i will take over the fryer. those boys at ibm need some catch of the day boxes, and i told them you would personally deliver them within the hour. i will reimburse you for gas.}
<A>__{brad dutifully unhooks his apron, to reveal the bottom half of his pirate suit.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{just write me out a bill.}
<A>__{while harold leans down to tally up the fish order, brad goes to a nearby employee's closet. he has completely perfected the art of changing back into his street clothes, and it takes less than a minute. he is just about to finish buttoning his street shirt when harold sees him.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{hamilton, come over here. what is that you've got on?}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{this is how i dress all the time.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{but you took off your captain kidd uniform.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{i thought i'd take it off for the drive over to ibm. it's kind of uncomfortable.}
<A>__{harold can barely fathom the idea.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{come on, hamilton. you're going over there to represent captain kidd fish and chips. we have stores all over southern california. part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. you know that!}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{you really want me to put all this stuff back on?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{yes. i think so. show some pride, hamilton.}
<B>__{angle on brad}
<A>__{as he stands there, stoic looking.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{i don't believe you're asking me to do this, but okay.}
<A>__{he begins taking off his street shirt. he looks at harold, looks at the boxes, and returns to the closet.}
