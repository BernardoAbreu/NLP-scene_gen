<L>__{interior high end indian clothing boutique. day.}
<A>__{a lavish bollywood soundtrack plays as emma wraps kym in lilac fabric for her sari esque bridesmaid's dress. kym examines herself in the mirrors of the private salon. the girls look like jewels against the lush fabrics, pillows and curtains. rachel sits at a vanity trying on dangling earrings and shakes her head gently, the gems glimmer and sparkle.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{isn't the lilac fabulous? you look like a freesia.}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(to rachel)}
<D>__{i love the grey.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{we're all wearing lilac.}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(heedless, grabbing the grey fabric)}
<D>__{look at this. i love this. it's like a cloud.}
<A>__{emma looks at rachel.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{you guys know how i am. i never wear lilac.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{it's good to have a principle.}
<A>__{kym ignores her.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you wore a lilac sweater with a cat face on it on the cover of seventeen magazine when i was at fat camp.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{sure, but i got paid for that and i was on horse tranquilizers. so why aren't i the maid of honor? why is emma the maid of honor?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{because.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i wasn't entirely sure when you were coming or even if you'd make it.}
<A>__{kym looks sharply at her.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i wasn't sure if you'd have time for a fitting.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{bullshit. it's a sari. you take a bolt of cloth and wrap it around you. jesus christ i've been home one day and i can't get a straight answer out of anybody.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{i'm talking about dad offering me food every ten seconds...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{dad offers irish hunger strikers food every ten seconds.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{no. he has to know where i am and what i'm doing all the time because he has never resolved his own trust issues.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{that's odd.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{blow me.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{oh, leave dad alone.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{i'd love to but he won't let me. i feel him watching me all the time. and carol and you guys too.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i know i have nothing better to think about.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{everybody's looking at me like i'm the visiting sociopath. what are you people waiting for me to do? burn the house down?}
<A>__{they both look at her.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{that was a mattress fire and it wasn't even at home! it was on a sleep over! god! i should just get hazmat tattooed on my forehead for you people.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{stop! you're like a harpy. is being my "maid of honor" this important to you? i didn't think you gave a shit.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{how could you fucking say that to me?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{jesus. emma!}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{emma, would you be horribly offended and hurt if i asked you to step down as...}
<P>__{(exaggerated, practically with quote fingers)}
<D>__{..."maid of honor?"}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{now emma's got another reason to hate me. like she needed one.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{is it what you want?}
<A>__{for an instant, conflict and pain flicker over rachel's sweet face.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{not really.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{fine. the crown is yours, first runner up.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{thank you, emma. no, thank you.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{it's not about you.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{it's about sisterhood.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{hooray for sisterhood.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{sisterhood conquers all.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and bludgeons all and pillages all and leaves all for dead.}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(returning to mirror)}
<D>__{so the gray is not an option?}
