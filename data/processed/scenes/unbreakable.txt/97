<A>__{megan and elijah are in the far corner of the room. they're separated from the other clients. megan is seated on an exercise machine. elijah is in his wheel chair facing her.}

<D>__{we're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.}
<P>__{(she taps the machine)}
<D>__{it works the quadriceps.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{how long have you been married?}
<A>__{megan is taken off guard by the question. she stares at elijah. beat.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{twelve years.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{how did you get together?}
<A>__{elijah smiles warmly. megan smiles softly back.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{a car accident.}
<A>__{elijah smiles even bigger.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{now you're going to have to tell me more.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{...see my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. our car flipped on an icy road. we were both injured. he couldn't play football anymore.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{football wasn't the kind of life i wanted... for ten years i'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. and if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. i've seen way too much of it in my job... i can barely take it when my clients are in pain.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't hate the game. i admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, i was in awe of how he could play it, but i couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. and it always does with that game.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's not a thing many people would understand.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{you and my mother would have a special connection.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{...and everyone lived happily ever after.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{sort of.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{what part of david's body was injured?}
<A>__{beat. megan's eyes become utterly still.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{who said my husband's name is david?}
