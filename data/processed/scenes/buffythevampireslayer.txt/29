<C>__{gary murray}
<D>__{i don't suppose you kids heard the first bell, did you? the first bell was saying, 'start going to class, it's time to go to class.' in about thirty seconds the second bell is going to be saying, 'already be in class.'}

<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(not harshly)}
<D>__{you're weird and i'm afraid of you. seriously, cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.}
