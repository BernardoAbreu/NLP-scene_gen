<A>__{in her pov the killer picks up rod's bedsheet and tests it between his powerful hands. without thinking, nancy bangs against the glass.}

<D>__{rod! look out!}
<A>__{the killer wheels around, locking eyes with nancy. the girl goes white. the man's face is in the light, and it's horrible seething with hatred and a twisted, insane intelligence. the hold of those eyes is only broken when rod rolls up on an elbow with a deep, troubled groan. the instant rod does this, the killer fades into the shadows in the cell. but even then his eyes hold on nancy's until the last second he's visible. rod looks around the cell groggily, runs his fingers through his matted hair, then collapses back on his pillow. no matter how hard nancy screams, rod never once looks at the window. he just pulls the twisted covers about his shoulders and succumbs once more to sleep. and now the bed sheet is no longer on the bed. the killer, materializing out of the shadow again, is holding it between his hands like a garrote. he looks up and leers at nancy, then moves for rod.}
