<L>__{interior side chapel. day}
<A>__{mark waits alone in a tiny chapel off to the side of the church. he turns his head, takes a suck on the mouthpiece of his portable respirator, then looks around at the impressive stained glass windows. the expression on mark's face is that of a true believer.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{i'm definitely a true believer. but i believe in a god with a sense of humor. a wicked sense of humor. one who created me in his own image.}
<A>__{father brendan enters. there is an awkward short moment when he realizes that there is no point in offering to shake hands. for no good reason, he nods instead.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{hello. i'm father brendan. i don't think we've met.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no, we haven't. i'm mark o'brien. i knew father seamus very well. i'm sorry that he's not here any more.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{as are many others. i'm going to do my best to fill his shoes. i understand you'd like me to hear your confession.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes, i would. by the way, i enjoyed mass. i liked your tone.}
<A>__{father brendan is not sure how to take this.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you don't believe absolute privacy is an essential part of the confessional, do you?}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{no, i do not. i believe sincerity is the most essential part.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i told my attendant to come back in half an hour. is that okay?}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{yes, take your time. i'm in no rush.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{did father seamus say anything to you about me?}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{no one said anything to me about you.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i can be a bit time consuming, but i'm worth the trouble.}
<A>__{father brendan breaks a smile for the first time.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{i'm here for you mark.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{look, this is not exactly a confession. i haven't yet done the deed. i was hoping to sort of get a quote in advance.}
<A>__{father brendan sits down.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{tell me what's on your mind.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{the most immediate thing on my mind would be my attendant, joan. i'm thinking of getting rid of her. it's an evil thought, but i can't help it.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{is she dishonest, or incompetent?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no, neither of those. she looks at me the wrong way. it's that you need me more than i need you look. i'd like to show her she's wrong, just for the evil satisfaction it will give me. is that a sin, father?}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{well, it obviously troubles you.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes, it troubles me a lot. because maybe it's really a power trip. me against her. me against the world.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{i really wouldn't worry too much about that. the question is whether you like having her around.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i can't stand her.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{then get rid of her. if i were in a position to choose, i'd get someone nice. even it was a power trip.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{then i have your blessing to fire her?}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{unofficially, yes.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that's good enough for me.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{please, if ever you feel i can be useful, do let me know. it was a pleasure talking with you.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{same here.}
