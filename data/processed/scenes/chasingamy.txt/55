<L>__{int comic book show day}
<A>__{it's one year later. we're at another show, not unlike the one from the opening. a copy of 'bluntman and chronic' enters the frame. the cover reads 'the death chronic', complete with a corresponding drawing.}
<C>__{banky v.o.}
<D>__{blast from the past.}
<A>__{banky sits at his own signing table. behind him hangs a banner that reads 'banky edwards creator of baby dave'. a small line is formed in front of him. he talks with a}
<B>__{fan.}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{do you know how much it's going for these days? one ten. you signing it will push that up even higher,}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{if you sell it, i want a kickback}
<P>__{(starts signing)}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{i don't know if this is true, but i heard once that there was going to be an animated series.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{there was going to be}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{what happened!}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(off comic)}
<D>__{you're looking at it. no chronic no cartoon}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{that sucks man. that would've been awesome.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{tell me about it}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{is that what happened to you and holden mcneil? you got into a fight over the rights or something?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{it was a little more involved than that.}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{whatever happened to him?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{he quit the biz. i guess.}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{you guys don't talk anymore?}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(looks oc)}
<D>__{no. not really.}
<A>__{banky locks eyes with someone oc. his expression softens. holden leans against a wall on the far side of the room. he smiles at banky. banky smiles back, and sort of nods. holden holds up a copy of banky's new solo comic. he points to it and gives a thumbs up.}
<C>__{oc fan}
<D>__{probably shouldn't have killed off chronic.}
<A>__{banky smiles to oc.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{guess not. some doors just shouldn't be opened.}
<A>__{banky looks in another direction, oc. he looks at holden and points to it. holden looks in the same direction, and then looks back at banky and nods.}
<C>__{oc fan}
<D>__{you don't need that guy, anyway. you do great stuff without him.}
<A>__{banky looks at holden for a beat. then he brings his pointer fingers together, mimicing holden's 'shared moment' gesture. holden shrugs slightly, then crosses his fingers as if to say 'hopefully'.}
<C>__{oc fan}
<D>__{you were just carrying that guy, anyway.}
<A>__{banky sort of smiles at the oc holden. then he offers his own thumbs up as to say 'good luck'.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(to fan, still looking oc)}
<D>__{you're so right.}
<A>__{holden smiles back, nods 'bye', and walks off.}
<C>__{oc fan}
<D>__{well, keep up the good work, man. love them dick jokes. love 'em. see ya.}
<A>__{the fan leaves, but banky is watching holden go.}
<C>__{bxvky}
<D>__{yeah. bye.}
<P>__{(shakes it off)}
