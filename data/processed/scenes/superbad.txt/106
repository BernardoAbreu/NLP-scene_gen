<A>__{officer michaels is sitting in the driver's seat.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{was the guy alright?}
<C>__{officer michaels}
<D>__{what? oh, yeah, the guy was fine.}
<A>__{michaels looks back at the homeless guy, who looks a little bit more awake than before.}
<C>__{officer michaels }
<D>__{are you awake, sir?}
<A>__{the guy starts to open his eyes a little. michaels grabs the guy's face and slams it back, knocking him out again. fogell jumps a little.}
<C>__{officer micheals}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mclovin. but i really need this to be a private thing.}
<A>__{officer michaels takes out two cigarettes, and gives one to fogell, who accepts, quivering in fear. michaels lights his, then passes the lighter to fogell.}
<C>__{officer micheals }
<D>__{listen mclovin, you... like... officer slater and myself, don't you?}
<A>__{fogell tries to light his cigarette. it takes a few tries and he starts hacking after the first pull.}
<C>__{fogell}
<P>__{(coughing)}
<D>__{umm, yeah, sure. you guys are great.}
<C>__{officer michaels}
<D>__{yeah, well, we're also on probation. you see, we've actually trashed two other cars. the first time wasn't our fault, and the second time a bee flew in and i freaked out. point is, we trash another car, without a good reason, we're fucked. know what i'm saying?}
<A>__{fogell continues to painfully suck back on the cigarette.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{officer michaels}
<D>__{now, we're going to arrest these guys, and if you don't mind, which you shouldn't, we'd like you to write a fake witness report saying they jumped out in front of our car. cool, mclovin?}
<A>__{fogell nods his head, getting some of his cigarette smoke in his eyes. he winces and starts to blink in discomfort.}
