<L>__{interior ares exercise sphere day}
<A>__{superimpose: mission time: day 13 there's no up here, equipment is attached to the floor, ceiling and walls. santen and bowman are on a large spinning bicycle driven centrifuge. santen's pedaling. by keeping up the speed, he's able to provide enough extra gravity for bowman, on the other side, to lift free weights. they're both dripping sweat so it must work. timer goes off, they slow to a stop. pettengill comes in. he looks a bit uncomfortable. certainly out of his element. a little, well, puny.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{so...required exercise. haven't had this since grade school.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{yeah, you musta been doing some kind of reverse thing where you get small...}
<A>__{santen's got years in the gym. muscles on muscles. bowman takes a two second evaluation of the situation.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{you're done. you can shower.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{i'm not done. i was gonna...}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{no. you're done.}
<A>__{santen can't believe he's being thrown out. but he's also a product of the military and couldn't argue if he tried.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<A>__{he leaves. pettengill feels stupid.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{you didn't have to do that.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{no. i did. if i didn't nip that in the bud, i wouldn't be doing my job.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{flying this beast is only half the job. the whole job's to get the crew in place in shape to do what they have to do. and the funny thing is, flying's the easy part.}
<A>__{pettengill stands abashed for a moment and then his resentment just bubbles out...}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{i just hate all those fucking guys. i feel like i've spent my entire life being the guy who was hassled in phys ed. i lost the first girl i ever cared about to some thug who could throw a football farther than i could. it's like women are hardwired to think that guys who are proficient at sports are going to be better providers. it's not like we hunt and kill our own food anymore.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{he sells cars for a living now. cars. i end up working on a project that may save the existence of mankind and he sells cars.}
<A>__{this is impressively obsessive.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{you kept track of him. what happened to her?}
<P>__{(off his look of "who?")}
<D>__{the girl.}
<A>__{he has no idea. she grins at him }
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{little competitive? who's hardwired for what, cro magnon guy?}
<A>__{he can't help it, he grins, a little abashed.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{we're gonna start with the bungees. try to quit being pissed off you weren't chosen for dodgeball, willya?}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{i will try. twenty years of hating the bullying motherfuckers is a hard habit to break.}
<B>__{end of flashback.}
