<L>__{interior jerry's deli night}
<A>__{a delicatessen. andy wears an apron and angrily cleans tables. he stacks dirty dishes and wipes up the food. two blue collar guys gesture from a booth.}
<C>__{blue collar guy 1}
<D>__{excuse me, could i please have more coffee?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, in a sec'.}
<P>__{(he lugs the dishes to the kitchen)}
<D>__{that was decaf, right?}
<A>__{the guy nods. andy hurries over with the coffeepot and starts pouring.}
<C>__{blue collar guy 1}
<D>__{you know, you look just like andy kaufman.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{yeah, i get that all the time.}
<A>__{andy hurries off. the guy's buddy leans in, whispering.}
<C>__{blue collar guy 2}
<D>__{i'm telling you, it's him.}
<C>__{blue collar guy 1}
<D>__{you wanna bet?? if that was him, he wouldn't be workin' here, pouring my coffee!}
<B>__{near the kitchen}
<A>__{andy dumps out wet coffee grounds. he is sweating. in the b.g., george enters the restaurant. he sees andy, sits at a table and yells out.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{hey! could you clear this table and bring me a piece of poundcake?}
<A>__{andy turns. they stare down each other.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{andy, this is ridiculous. take off that apron.}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(infuriated)}
<D>__{no! i'd rather work here, than at abc. there's no lying in a restaurant. they don't promise you a job as a cashier, then suddenly make you a frycook!}
<A>__{andy hurries off with a water pitcher. george chases him.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{look, i'm sorry. they're assholes! but we work in a creative business. you can't predict what people are gonna like }
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{the only reason i did taxi was so i could have my own special!}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(trying to calm him)}
<D>__{tell you what. i will book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the special around... see if somebody wants to buy it }
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(bitter)}
<D>__{yeah, we can have a garage sale. "hey look, i got a floor lamp and a network tv special for only fifty cents!"}
<A>__{a glum moment. andy fills water glasses.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{how long is left on my taxi contract?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you signed for five years }
<P>__{(awkward)}
<D>__{so four years, seven months.}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(he looks up)}
<D>__{okay... i will go back. but just let them know, first they ain't gettin' latka. they're gettin' tony!}
