<A>__{hal, wearing sheriff's garb, storms towards maggie's side of the copter as the engine shuts off and the rotor dies.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{maggie, where the hell have you been? i've got two climbers out }
<A>__{gabe gets out of the copter, and hal sees him for the first time. unlike the last time we saw them, neither man is glad to see the other. hal turns on maggie.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{brett and evan are up there again to jump off the spur. their wives called twice. i want you in the air and i want them found before the storm system moves in.}
<P>__{(maggie hesitates)}
<D>__{now.}
<A>__{maggie takes off as gabe and hal step away from the copter. gabe eyes hal's uniform and almost not quite but almost laughs.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{christ. you're in charge of rescue now?}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{there was a vacancy. maybe you heard about it. the last guy lost his nerve and lit out of town.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{well, you're a better man than i am, hal. nothing rattles you.}
<A>__{the rookie climbers get off the practice wall to watch this faceoff. gabe and hal are one crack away from beating hell out of each other. frank heads over to defuse the confrontation.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(steering gabe away)}
<D>__{gabe! long time, son why don't you come meet some of the new guys }
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{good idea. say, hal?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why don't you come with me so we can show these rookies how to death rig a woman properly?}
<A>__{that tears it hal rushes gabe and they pummel each other until frank and the others pull them apart, panting and bleeding. hal throws off the men holding him back but instead of going at gabe again, hal throws gabe a set of car keys.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{take the bronco to where you're going. i've already been. then go back to wherever it is you like to hide. and stay there.}
<A>__{hal heads back into the office gabe heads for the bronco.}
