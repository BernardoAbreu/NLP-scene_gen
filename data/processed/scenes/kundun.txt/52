<L>__{exterior terrace, potala day}
<A>__{norbu thundrup holds the boy steady. and, a wondorous view of lhasa is presented. vendors hawk their goods to elegant ladies, wearing turquoise jewelry and carrying silken parasols. animals are herded through town by young boys. children play and squabble. a white wall is covered with cartoons, lampoons political posters picturing the regent, perhaps, as a man holding too much power.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{i want to go down there.}
<C>__{norbu thundrup}
<D>__{you can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{i want to run down the street. i want to buy a toy. eat from the shops.}
<C>__{norbu thundrup}
<D>__{you cannot.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{i want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.}
<C>__{norbu thundrup}
<D>__{but you are not a shepherd, you are the dalai lama.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{maybe in the next life, the world will not need a dalai lama. nornu thundrup i would not know. maybe.}
<A>__{the view travels and we see a prison yard. shackled men share the yard with hairy, fat dogs. one man looks up and sees that the yard is under surveillance. of course the men all know that this terrace belongs to the boy dalai lama. as the boy watches, first one poor, ragged man, then another prostrates. tenzin gyatso pulls away from the telescope. he waves to the prisoners.}
