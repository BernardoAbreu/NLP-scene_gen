<A>__{julianne seated at the sink, staring into the mirror, as digger gently applies soup, cloth and water to easing away the mask. a paleontologist restoring a bronze age artifact. by the side of the half filled sink, rests her plugged in curling iron.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{what i mean, when i say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. it is vulnerable and endearing. and that is annoying as shit.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{you like her.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{if i didn't have to hate her, i'd adore her.}
<A>__{she looks up at him and winces, as the movement makes him scrape her face. he's sorry.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{last night, she was crying, these big, real tears, when she thought she'd lost him. it was like there was a knife in her heart...}
<A>__{looking in his eyes. needs him to hear.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{... and i put it there. i hated myself, i grieved for her, i couldn't enjoy one second of it! and then, when it didn't work...}
<A>__{can you believe this?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i was devastated.}
<C>__{digger}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{go figure you.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{because i realized. when i see him say "i do," that knife will be in my heart. and it will be there every...}
<A>__{she holds his wrists now. to stop him. to plead for understanding. forgiveness.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{... every time i think of him, forever, which could be a lot.}
<A>__{she almost choked on that last part. so she composes herself.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{you watch a guy caress his girlfriend's butt. you see an old spice commercial. sentimental moments are everywhere, when you're in the right frame of mind.}
<A>__{she swallows hard. fights for a grip on her determination.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{there are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{you've been working on this, huh?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.}
<A>__{she sets her jaw.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{this is my whole life's happiness. i have to be ruthless.}
<C>__{digger}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{and you believe that.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(unconvincing)}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{his eyes are gentle and merciless at once. no way she gets off this hook.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{he was in love with me every day for nine years. i can make him happier than she can.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{it's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{i don't know the meaning of the word guilt!}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{impressive.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! she would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{the man you love.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{beyond reason. the feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{someday she'll thank you.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{let's not get carried away.}
<A>__{and the defenses drain from her clay ravaged features. the real julianne is glimpsed.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i'd settle for. someday, i will forgive myself.}
<A>__{for...?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{for doing this terrible thing.}
<A>__{her eyes tear up.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{which, by the way, i can't figure out how to do.}
<A>__{as the tears fall, he wipes at them, discovering...}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{jesus. you're supposed to take your make up off before you apply the m...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i know that! i was distracted by grief!}
<A>__{oh.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{guess what i brushed my teeth with last night?}
<A>__{he thinks about this. following her eyes to the toiletries kit, he browses for a moment...}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{zit cream?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i wish.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{neosporin?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{try less appropriate.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{ben gay.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{that was thursday.}
<A>__{he stops on that note.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{elmer's glue?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{don't be ridiculous, we're having a serious conversation!}
<A>__{she's hysterical.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{i give.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i can't even say it.}
<A>__{now. he's curious.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{a hinterior the first word is "preparation." then comes a letter of the alphabet, perilously close to g.}
<A>__{she reaches to test her curling iron, burns her finger, shit! knocking the appliance into the half filled sink. she lunges for it, and a terrified digger grasps her arm...}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{considering the circumstances, i'm not wholly against suicide...}
<A>__{huh?}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{just not by electrocution in front of me!}
<A>__{oh.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{i've got this noon flight.}
<A>__{he reaches to pull the plug from the wall, and now she lunges to grab his arm, slipping, her face falling forward, stopping an inch above the sink.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{how do you know you can touch that plug? are you a licensed contractor?}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{what do you suggest?}
<A>__{she looks from the plug down the cord, to the submerged curling iron. and back.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{maybe they just seal off this room. they have others.}
<A>__{he's staring at her. sweet, but intense.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{i didn't mean about that.}
<A>__{oh. again.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{if i hear the words "tell the truth," or any paraphrase thereof, i dive into the sink and pull you with me.}
<A>__{looking at her. looking at her.}
<C>__{digger}
<D>__{let's go meet michael. i will wait downstairs.}
