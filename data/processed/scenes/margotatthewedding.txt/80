<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you used to need me to watch you when you played.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(vaguely)}
<D>__{when you first started to play with friends, you wouldn't do it unless i watched you. you were afraid i would go out the back door. i don't know where i would go. our yard didn't lead anywhere anyway.}
<A>__{she takes off her sweater and reveals an old faded yellow t shirt. she isn't wearing a bra. claude says suddenly:}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i masturbated last night. while everyone was asleep i went into the bathroom and did it.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you don't have to tell me, sweety.}
<A>__{the bus driver slams the luggage compartment closed.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you've got to go.}
<A>__{margot ties her sweater around her waist and takes claude's hand. they approach the bus. claude's body tenses.}

<A>__{she hugs him. he clutches her.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{the world feels strange to me right now.}
<A>__{margot nods sympathetically. she kisses his lips and releases him. he reaches into his bag and shyly puts on his wrap around punk sunglasses. margot makes a face.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{they make your face look too wide.}
<A>__{claude removes them and puts them back in the bag.}

<D>__{you're acting like a baby.}
<A>__{she backs away }
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{don't see dick.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{don't worry. i don't think he wants to see me anyway.}

<D>__{please, margot. promise me.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{don't call me that.}
<A>__{claude doesn't move. margot points at the bus and mouths "go". she turns in the other direction. claude, frustrated and anxious approaches the vehicle.}
