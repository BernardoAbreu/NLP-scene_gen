<A>__{a super slowly appears: "exactly one year later" on sunset, two dudes come riding along on skateboards. suddenly they reach insanity. traffic on sunset is jammed. honking limousines jockey to squeeze by. confused, one dude squints into the distance and his eyes pop.}
<D>__{dude #2 oh my god.}
<P>__{(stupefied)}
<D>__{that's the freakiest thing i've ever seen!! look!}
<A>__{he points. his friend turns and gasps. at the comedy store the marquee says "tony clifton: live!"}
<D>__{dude #1 man, we were right! he's not dead! dude #2 he's just been lyin' low for a year! we gotta go!}
<A>__{hysterical, the guys race up to the club. but outside, there's a crazed, pulsing mob. people are screaming. police have barricades. everybody cries to get in.}
