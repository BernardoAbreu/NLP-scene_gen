<C>__{eep}
<D>__{i was watching. i was fine.}
<C>__{grug}

<C>__{eep}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{what were you looking for?}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{well then why did you go up there?}
<C>__{eep}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{why don't you know? stop looking for things. fear keeps us alive eep. never not be afraid.}
<A>__{eep climbs up on a ledge and curls up in the corner where a tiny spot of light seeps in.}
<C>__{eep}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{what's the point of all this?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{hmmm? what was that?}
<C>__{eep}
<P>__{(a little louder)}
<D>__{i mean, why are we here? what are we doing this for?}
<C>__{croods}
<C>__{groan}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{no one said survival was fun.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{nothing is fun.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{hmm? would you come down here. eep?}

<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{grug. off.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{grug climbs back up.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{off!}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{i just don't see why she needs her own ledge. that's all. that's what this is about.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{she's working through some things and needs her own space.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{what things? how long is this going to take? really? i mean she already doesn't listen to me.}
<A>__{a pebble hits grug in the head. it came from eep's ledge.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{see? she's listening.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{if she wants to survive, she has to follow our rules.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{how about a story? eep loves those.}
<A>__{grug brightens.}
<C>__{grug}
<P>__{(brightening)}
<D>__{that's a good idea ... how about a story, huh?}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{oh yeah, tell us a story.}
<A>__{the croods minus eep gather in a semi circle on the ground. grug retrieves sandy and her krispy bear from the bone crib.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{ok. can i borrow that? thank you. eep! your old favorite?}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{i haven't played with that thing in years.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{tonight we'll hear the story of krispy bear.}
<A>__{grug sits and waits a beat for eep to join, but she stays put. as grug talks, he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall of the cave.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{a long time ago, this little bear was alive. she was alive because she listened to her father and lived her life in routine and darkness and terror. so she was happy. but krispy had one, terrible problem. she was filled with... curiosity.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{grug!}
<A>__{ugga covers sandy's ears.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{yes. and one day, while she was in a tree, the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{wha?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{and no sooner than she climbed to the top, she saw something new and died.}
<A>__{grug swats the painting.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{just like that?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{yes! her last moments of terror still frozen on her face.}
<A>__{grug holds out krispy bear. the family is terrified.}
<C>__{gran}
<D>__{oh, same ending as everyday.}
<C>__{thunk}
<P>__{(freaked out)}
<D>__{i get it, dad. i get it. i will never do anything new or different.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{good man, thunk.}
<A>__{pan across the walls to reveal they are covered with stories all seemingly with the same ending.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{alright, everyone sharpen your teeth and let's pile up.}
<A>__{all their worst fears confirmed, the croods snuggle into one big heap, warm and comfy. grug casts a glance to eep's ledge. she doesn't budge.}
