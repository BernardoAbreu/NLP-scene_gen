<L>__{8 ball fell, with the remote laying by its side.}
<A>__{woody smiles for a beat and then runs in a panic over to buzz.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{buzz!! oh, buzz, buzz lightyear!! buzz lightyear, thank goodness! we've got trouble!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{trouble?!}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{where?!}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(pointing to the back of the desk)}
<D>__{down there. just down there. a helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, buzz!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{then we've no time to lose!!}
<A>__{buzz runs over and looks down the back of the desk.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i don't see anything!}
<A>__{woody picks up the remote for the rc car and switches it on. rc's eyes (headlights) open sleepily.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{oh, he's there. just, just keep looking.}
<A>__{woody hits the "forward" button on the remote and steers the rc car straight for buzz.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{what kind of a toy ?}
<A>__{buzz turns to see rc headed straight for him. he dives out of the way as the rc car smashes into the base of...}
<B>__{a bulletin board}
<A>__{the impact forces pushpins to fly out of the board. buzz ducks as pins land all around him, sticking into the desk like arrows.}
<B>__{potato head}
<A>__{sits on the floor in the midst of a card game with hamm. he looks up at the desk and gasps as the bulletin board slams down onto...}
<B>__{a globe}
<A>__{knocking it out of its stand. the globe starts rolling right at buzz. woody stands frozen in disbelief at the chaos he's created. buzz runs along the desk, the globe rolling right behind him, indiana jones style. buzz gets stuck "log rolling" on a pile of pencils, but at the last second jumps out of the way onto the window ledge. the globe lumbers past buzz and strikes a luxo style desklamp. the arm of the lamp swings all the way around, barely missing woody... ...and knocks buzz out the window.}
<C>__{toys}
<D>__{buzz!!!!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{buzz!!!}

<D>__{where is your honor, dirtbag?! you are an absolute disgrace! you don't deserve to }
<A>__{woody seals the lid back on the bucket. potato head starts closing in on woody.}

<A>__{potato head has driven woody back to the very edge of the desk trapped.}
<C>__{hamm}
<D>__{i don't think we should give him the chance.}
<A>__{suddenly, the lid pops off the bucket of army men.}
<C>__{sargent}
<D>__{there he is, men! frag him!}
<A>__{the army men yell charge and pounce on woody, while all the rest of the toys close in.}

<A>__{the toys all drop woody and rush back to their places. andy enters the room and heads straight for the desk where woody is lying. andy overlooks woody and begins searching around the room.}

<D>__{mom! do you know where buzz is?}
<C>__{mrs. davis }
<D>__{no, i haven't seen him.}
<A>__{woody painfully watches as andy searches in vain for buzz.}
<C>__{mr. potato head }
<D>__{psssst!}
<A>__{woody looks across the room. potato head and etch a sketch peek out of a packing box. etch a sketch scribbles a hangman's noose while potato head points an accusing finger in woody's direction. woody gulps.}
<C>__{mrs. davis }
<D>__{andy! i'm heading out the door.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{but mom, i can't find him!}
