<L>__{interior cub room night}
<A>__{eve enters and slides in beside addison.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{hungry?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{just some coffee.}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(pours)}
<D>__{i'm not surprised. after all that humble pie...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{nothing of the kind. karen and i had a nice talk.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{heart to heart? woman to woman? including a casual reference to the part of "cora" and your hopes of playing it.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i discussed it very openly. i told her that i had spoken to lloyd and that he was interested.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{she mentioned, of course, that margo expects to play the part?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{oddly enough she didn't say a word about margo. just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that i play the part.}
<A>__{addison puffs at his cigarette, bemused.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{just like that, eh?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{just like that.}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{do you know, eve sometimes i think you keep things from me.}
<A>__{eve's feelings are hurt.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i don't think that's funny.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{it wasn't meant to be.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i confide in you and rely on you more than anyone i've ever known! to say a thing like that now without any reason when i need you more than ever...}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(breaks in)}
<D>__{i hope you mean what you say, eve. i intend to hold you to it.}
<A>__{their eyes meet.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{we have a great deal in common, it seems to me...}
<A>__{they both look as karen passes them on her way back to her table. group, as karen joins them. another bottle of champagne has come and almost gone there's a fine, cheery feeling among them. margo, in particular, is cheery. a pause. karen downs a glass of champagne.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{ well? what happened?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{nothing much. she apologized.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{with tears?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{with tears.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{but not right away? first the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{check.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{very classy stuff, lots of technique }
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you mean all this time she'd done nothing but apologize? what'd you say?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{not much.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{groom }
<P>__{(bill says "huh?")}
<D>__{ may i have a wedding present?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what would you like? texas?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i want everybody to shut up about eve. just shut up about eve, that's all i want. give karen more wine...}
<P>__{(blissfully)}
<D>__{... never have i been so happy. isn't this a lovely room? the cub room. what a lovely, clever name. where the elite meet. never have i seen so much elite and all with their eyes on me. waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. but not tonight. even eve. i forgive eve... there they go.}
<A>__{they all look. addison and eve, they get up and go without looking back. group, they watch for an instant.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{there goes eve. eve evil, little miss evil. but the evil that men do how does it go, groom? something about the good they leave behind i played it once in rep in wilkes barre...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you've got it backwards. even for wilkes barre.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you know why i forgive eve? because she's left good behind the four of us, together like this, it's eve's fault i forgive her...}
<A>__{karen's reactions are, of course, most important. knowing what she's done to margo wondering how to do what she must.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{... and bill. especially bill. eve did that, too.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you know, she probably means well, after all...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{she is a louse.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(to lloyd)}
<D>__{never try to outguess margo.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{groom.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{yes, dear.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you know what i'm going to be?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{a cowboy.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{a married lady.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{with the paper to prove it.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i'm going to have a home. not just a house i'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. i will look up at six o'clock and there he'll be... remember, karen?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i remember.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{you'll be there, won't you.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{often enough to keep the franchise.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. and no more make believe! off stage or on... remember, lloyd.}
<P>__{(lloyd nods)}
<D>__{i mean it, now. grown up women only, i might even play a mother only one child, of course, not over eight...}
<P>__{(they all smile)}
<D>__{lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{that depends.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i mean really, deeply angry...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i don't think i could be.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{well. i don't want to play "cora."}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(explodes)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{margo misinterprets her vehemence.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(hastily)}
<D>__{now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part it's a great part. and a fine play. but not for me anymore not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{what's your being married got to do with it?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it means i've finally got a life to live! i don't have to play parts i'm too old for just because i've got nothing to do with my nights!}
<P>__{(then quietly)}
<D>__{i know you've made plans. i will make it up to you, believe me. i will tour a year with this one, anything only you do understand don't you, lloyd?}
<A>__{lloyd never gets to answer. because karen, before anyone can stop her, bursts into hysterical laughter...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{what's so funny?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{nothing...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{nothing?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{everything... everything's so funny...}
<A>__{margo removes the champagne glass from in front of karen...}
