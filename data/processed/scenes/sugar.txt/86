<A>__{the higgins' son, michael (40s), and his wife, hilary (40s), and their daughter, anne (17), join earl and helen for miguel's first dinner in iowa. helen leads the table in grace...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{dear lord... thank you for the meal we are about to eat. and for blessing us with our new guest. and guiding him safely on his journey from the dominican republic to bridgetown...}
<A>__{miguel glances around the table. everyone's head is bowed and eyes closed. his eyes stop on anne, seated across from him. she's an attractive all american girl, but would never dream of flaunting her good looks. after taking her in, miguel closes his eyes.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{...and finally, lord... please look kindly over the swing this season. may all the players stay healthy and... well, why not?... if there's anything you can do to help us win another championship, we'll take that too... amen.}
<A>__{the table laughs, followed by a chorus of amens. miguel opens his eyes, greeted with smiles. he smiles too, as everyone passes dishes around the table.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{so, miguel... do you eat meatloaf back home?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i already told you, michael, he doesn't speak any english.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i know but... i'm curious to know what he thinks of the meatloaf.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{what do you care? you didn't cook it.}
<C>__{hilary}
<P>__{(to michael)}
<D>__{i doubt they have meatloaf in the dominican republic, dear.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i bet they have something similar. they probably just have another name for it.}
<A>__{all eyes are on miguel as he nervously takes a bite. a suspenseful beat, until... ...he smiles and nods. everyone sighs, smiles, and nods back.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{this is good old fashioned american home cooking, miguel. welcome to america.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{i like. thank you.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{well, very good, miguel. de nada to you, mi amigo. de nada to you.}
<A>__{anne smiles at miguel, a little embarrassed by her grandpa. miguel smiles back, then gets back to his meatloaf.}
