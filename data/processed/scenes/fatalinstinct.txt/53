<A>__{it's raining. ned pops the cassette into the tape player.}
<C>__{lola's voice}
<D>__{ned, darling... i know this seems like a strange way to talk with you... but since you won't take my calls, i have no other choice.}
<P>__{(then suddenly)}
<D>__{watch it! that red car's turning left!}
<A>__{ned swerves to avoid a collision, honking his horn.}
<C>__{lola's voice}
<D>__{i love you, ned. we're meant to be together... forever.}
<P>__{(then suddenly)}
<D>__{the light's changing! floor it! go! go! go!}
<A>__{ned guns it!... accelerating through a yellow light.}
<C>__{lola's voice}
<D>__{nice move!}
<P>__{(then sincere again)}
<D>__{nothing can keep us apart, ned. not even your wife. i'd hate to have to tell her about us, but if necessary... i will.}
<A>__{we see headlights behind ned's car.}
