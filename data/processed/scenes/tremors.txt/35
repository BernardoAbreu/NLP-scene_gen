<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now. everybody we know between here and bixby is already dead.}
<A>__{earl points ahead and screams:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{look out!!}
<A>__{val brings the truck to a squealing stop. ahead: the collapsed embankment completely blocks the road. it's totally impassable. the cowboys are dumbfounded.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{is some higher force at work, here? are we asking too much of life?}
<A>__{but val is in no mood for philosophy. he leaps out and peers into the highway maintenance truck which sits undisturbed, emergency lights still flashing. there's nobody in it. he starts looking around.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{those assholes are supposed to be fixing the goddamn road!}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{hey! where are you guys? people gotta use this road, you know! you on a booze break or what?!}

<A>__{val looks where he's pointing howard's bloodstained hardhat lies at the edge of the landslide. val gets the pointerior looking around for the unknown assailant, he eases back into the truck. earl already has a pistol in his lap and is digging through the glove compartment.}
<C>__{earl }
<D>__{where are the bullets? don't we have any goddamn bullets?}
<A>__{val quickly jockeys the truck to turn it around on the narrow road. but as he backs into the hillside, we hear a strange grating clunk from underneath. when he tries to pull forward, the truck won't move. the engine stalls.}

<D>__{jesus! i don't believe this!}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you're hung up again.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{i am not!}

<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you're hung up i tell you. you're gonna burn the clutch.}
<A>__{val slams the truck into low range four wheel drive and revs it. the tires dig in, fighting for traction and suddenly the truck lurches free. we hear an eerie shriek mingled with gear and engine noise as val angrily roars away.}
<C>__{earl }
<D>__{jesus, you can break an axle like that.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<C>__{earl}
