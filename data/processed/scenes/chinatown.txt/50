<L>__{interior parlor evelyn}
<A>__{looking. either by accident or design, the primarily octogenarian guests have segregated themselves. in one wing, the men are playing pinochle, some are playing dominoes, one elderly gentleman sits by himself carefully peeling an orange. in an adjacent parlor several white headed ladies work on a quilt. gittes grabs evelyn's hand.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{they're all here. every goddam name.}
<A>__{gittes points to the wall. it says "activities board". there are titles. "lawn bowling". "bridge". "fishing". "croquet". below them are the names of the guests, entered under certain activities, for certain days. after evelyn looks, she turns to gittes.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(continuing; indicating}
<D>__{the ancients around}
<P>__{them)}
<D>__{you're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(astonished)}
<D>__{they can't be.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{they may not know it but they are.}
<A>__{gittes strolls toward the women knitting and working on the quilt.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{hello, girls.}
<A>__{two of the ladies giggle. the third continues to busy herself with her quilt, off by herself.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{which one of you is emma dill?}
<A>__{two of them say "she is," and point in different directions. the third gives them a curt look and goes back to her knitting. gittes approaches her.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{are you emma?}
<A>__{some old voice is singing softly, "don't sit under the apple tree."}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i've been wanting to meet you.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?}
<C>__{emma}
<P>__{(stitching, smiles)}
<D>__{i'm not.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{well you own a lot of land.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{not anymore. oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in long beach, but we lost it.}
<A>__{gittes looks at the quilt. in it is the head of a fish among the rest of the crazy quilt pattern. gittes spots it.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{that's just lovely.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{thank you...}
<A>__{he looks through the quilt for other pieces of the fish, comes across the tail and by it the initials a.c.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(indicating tail)}
<D>__{where did you get this material?}
<C>__{emma}
<P>__{(what it sounds like)}
<D>__{the apple core club.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{the apple core?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{no. the albacore. it's a fish. my grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{how do they do that?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{give us things. not just some old flag like this, but }
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(kneeling)}
<D>__{but what?}
<C>__{palmer's voice}
<D>__{we're a sort of unofficial charity of theirs, mr. gittes. would you care to come this way? someone wants to see you.}
<A>__{gittes looks up, sees palmer standing in the doorway, looking taut and a little drawn. evelyn is beside him. she gestures as if there's someone behind palmer. gittes rises.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{see you later, emma.}
<A>__{he walks toward palmer who waits for him to walk in front.}
<B>__{at the entrance hall mulvihill}
<A>__{is waiting. he's got his hand in his pocket. evelyn looks to gittes. the four of them stand there, mulvihill towering over everyone.}
<C>__{mulvihill}
<D>__{come on i want you to meet somebody, gittes.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(glancing from palmer to mulvihill)}
<D>__{can we leave the lady out of this?}
<C>__{mulvihill}
<P>__{(a little uncertain)}
<D>__{yeah, why not?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{okay, i'd like to walk her to her car.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i will stay.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(taking her by the arm)}
<D>__{get in the car.}
<C>__{mulvihill}
<D>__{i will see she makes it.}
<A>__{mulvihill has walked up beside gittes. he makes the mistake of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back to gittes for a moment. gittes swiftly pulls mulvihill's jacket up over his head. he spins him around. with his jacket covering his face, gittes hammers away at mulvihlll, beating him against the glass door, along the wall, mercilessly pounding his fists into the cloth until the cloth turns red and mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor. palmer screams. evelyn stands there astonished. mulvihill's gun has clattered to the floor.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(as mulvihill hits the floor, to evelyn)}
<D>__{what are you waiting for? get in the car!}
<A>__{evelyn goes. mulvihill tries to get up again. palmer starts to go for the gun, nearly picking it up. gittes slaps it out of his hand and kicks it. it goes flying down the hall, at least thirty feet; hits the wall. palmer goes screaming off into the night. gittes turns back to mulvihill who starts to get up, then collapses. gittes goes out the front door, ignoring the excited audience of ancients behind him.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{as gittes walks down the pathway, he stops. two men are coming toward him. one of them is shorter, and has the nervous, jerky moves of the man who slit his nose. gittes stops. the two men fan out and continue to move toward him. gittes spots the two tone shoes. he begins to back up. suddenly there is a pair of headlights flashing brilliantly behind the two men. in a moment evelyn's car is headed across the lawn directly toward the two men, accelerating as it gets near them. they look in disbelief, then dive for safety. the car skids to a stop, fishtailing a little on the grass. evelyn opens the passenger door.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{get in.}
<A>__{gittes jumps in and she takes off across the lawn, tilting the elegant little neon sign on the lawn as she goes. two}
<B>__{shots are fired.}
