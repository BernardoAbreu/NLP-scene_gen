<L>__{exterior field day}
<A>__{pauline and malcolm open the gate to the vogler's property.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i think we shouldn't mention the tree, we should let them know that there will be people and music on saturday and it will be louder than usual.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{and that they can come for a glass of champagne. but you tell them. i think they respond to you better.}
<A>__{they approach the vogler's sun worn and paint chipped house.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{well, i am ultimately one of them. you shouldn't've made me shave the stache.}
<C>__{pauline}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{yeah, right.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{oh, hey, ingrid is asking me if i was ever gay. do you know what that's about?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{mr. vogler, wearing a fleece vest and carrying a hatchet over his shoulders, tramples out of the brush.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{vogler stops. his face is jagged and worn.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{hi, i'm pauline. this is malcolm. we've met before. we're your neighbors.}
<A>__{the man watches them strangely with icy blue eyes.}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{you gonna cut that tree down?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{well, we grew up with that tree and we're getting married under it saturday and }
<A>__{she waits for malcolm to jump in. he doesn't. vogler says softly, but sternly:}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{the roots are growing into our property. it's rotting, it's killing our plants.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{we had a tree doctor out and he said it was healthy.}
<A>__{pauline smacks malcolm's arm.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{would it hurt you to say anything?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what? what do you want from me?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you're making me do the whole fucking thing.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you brought up the tree.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{he brought up }
<A>__{she stops herself. she says to vogler:}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i'm sorry... this was better thought through back at the house.}
<A>__{pauline's gaze goes above vogler's head like margot described earlier. he runs his hand through his hair as if something might be caught in there.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{we were wondering if you and your wife i'm sorry i forgot her name would like to come over for...}
<C>__{vogler}
<D>__{you should ask her. she makes the plans. i'm going to go in now.}
<A>__{he tramps inside. the screen door bangs.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i felt like you didn't give me a chance to say what i wanted to say.}
<A>__{pauline hits him in the chest and starts to walk away. malcolm comes after her, his rage growing.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i want to punch that guy in the nose!}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you've never hit anyone.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i have too!}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{lots of you don't know them. they're not around because i've punched them.}
<A>__{a smile breaks across pauline's face. malcolm seethes.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{don't laugh, pauline. it's not funny. i will fucking punch your sister.}
<A>__{malcolm clenches his fists. he points at vogler's place.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{the threat is not out there. it's in our house. it's sleeping in my studio. i mean, i wouldn't actually hit her, but i feel...i feel like doing it. she's such a fucking idiot.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{she's not an idiot. you might not like her }
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{she is. she is an idiot! you're an idiot.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you're both fucking morons. i'm so fucking... i'm trying so hard. you don't give me any credit.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{what is wrong?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i don't know, i have the emotional version of whatever bad feng shui would be. i don't know. you tell me, you understand this shit.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{did you drink your teas?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{yeah, i drank my fucking teas! don't judge me now. really, i think when you look back at this you're going to see i'm not acting like a crazy person. that this is the right reaction. in proportion with what is going on. this is right!}
<A>__{malcolm looks around furiously. the only thing available to him is a leafy stalk. he pulls on it, but it won't uproot. he tears the leaves off in a rage.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you have the most oddly self conscious form of rage i've ever }
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i hate you.}
<A>__{exhausted he approaches her. he says, still with anger:}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{let's make love.}
