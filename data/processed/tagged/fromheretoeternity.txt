<B>__{six months before pearl harbor}
<A>__{the taxi pulls up across the street from camera. a soldier gets out, pulls two heavily loaded barracks bags after him. he pays the driver, hoists the bags to his back, moves toward camera. the taxi drives away slowly. the soldier walks toward steps leading to a low building. he is prewitt (called "prew" for short), 22 years old, well built, good looking. he wears an enlisted man's uniform and on the sleeves are marks where chevrons have been removed. he pauses, looks up over the door. camera pans up to sign which reads: orderly room g company, 219th regiment.}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{a small thin soldier in an undershirt and fatigue pants backs out of the screen door and into shot. he is wielding a frayed broom. this is private angelo maggio. he is violent and funny and sour and friendly. he sees prewitt's legs but not his face, speaks as he sweeps a cloud of dust off the porch.}
<C>__{maggid}
<D>__{fine way to pass the time. good for the mind.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{hello, maggio.}
<A>__{maggio turns and stares at prew, astonished.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{prew...?}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{i transferred out of fort shatter.}
<A>__{maggio notices the marks on the sleeves where the stripes have been removed. prew follows his glance.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{you quit the bugle corps...?}
<A>__{prew nods. maggio jerks his head toward the sign.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{to here...?}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{that's what the orders say.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{you made a bad mistake. this outfit they can give back to custer.}
<A>__{prew smiles slightly, starts toward door.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{the captain ain't in yet.}
<A>__{prew puts down his barracks bags.}
<C>__{prey}
<D>__{i will look around.}
<C>__{maggio}
<P>__{(smiles for first time)}
<D>__{maybe we borrow some money from a twenty per cent man and take a real trip to town some night.}
<C>__{phew}
<D>__{maybe.}
<B>__{trucking shot along company street}
<A>__{prew walks slowly down the raised porch alongside the street. he takes the mouthpiece of a bugle from his pocket, jiggles it idly, a habit of his. he comes to the dayroom, glances through the screen door, goes in.}
<L>__{interior dayroom day}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{the dayroom has a pool table, ping pong table, a radio, etc. moth eaten, upholstered chairs line both walls. the place is empty as prew enters. he looks around casually, sees the pool table in an alcove. he moves over to it, puts the bugle mouthpiece in his pocket, picks a cue from the rack on the wall. he switches on the light, chalks the cue.}
<B>__{medium close shot}
<A>__{the triangle of balls is already racked on the table. prew addresses the cue ball, shoots and breaks the rack solidly. he watches the balls hurry around the table.}
<C>__{warden's voice }
<D>__{what're you think you're doing!? why ain't you out in the field with the compny? what's your name?}
<A>__{the voice is brawling, brash, vigorous. prew turns slowly. camera angle widens to include first sergeant milton warden, almost at prew's elbow. he is thirty four, big and powerful, has a neatly trimmed moustache.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{prewitt. transfer from shafter.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{yeah. i heard about you.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i heard about you, too, warden.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{well, put up that cue and come along. this here's a rifle outfit, prewitt. you ain't suppose to enjoy yourself before sundown. the man's very particlar about little things like that.}
<A>__{warden goes out of the dayroom. prew puts up the cue and follows him.}
<L>__{exterior company street}
<C>__{trucking shot}
<A>__{as prew and warden walk along the porch, warden a few paces ahead. they go into the orderly room.}
<L>__{interior orderly room day}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{as prew and warden enter. maggio is sweeping the room. mazzioli, a bespectacled, intellectual looking private first class, is at the clerk's desk, opening it, taking out papers, etc. prew sits on a bench as warden goes over to mazzioli.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{mazzioli! grant went to the hospital yesterday. did you make up his sick record? did you make a note for the morning report?! you're the compny clerk. the lousy sickbook is your job!}
<C>__{mazzioli}
<D>__{those medics didn't get the sickbook back till late yesterday i will tend to it right now }
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{thanks. i already done it for you.}
<C>__{another angle}
<A>__{maggio has swept his way over to prew. he stops sweeping now, stares at the other man as if still incredulous.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{but you the beat bugler they got over at shatter. you probly the best on this whole rock.}
<A>__{in b.g., warden has turned from mazzioli and is looking at prew. prew looks back coolly, answers maggio thoughtfully.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{that's true.}
<A>__{maggio wags his head, bends over to pick up wastepaper basket.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{well, friend, i feel for you. but from my position i can't quite reach you.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{ten sh hut!}
<A>__{prewitt, mazzioli and maggio spring to attention. the screen door bangs and captain dana holmes enters shot. he wears cavalry boots and spurs. he is about forty, unsure of himself, therefore always too certain with his men. he nods pleasantly.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{at ease. good morning, men. anything special this morning, sergeant warden? i've only a few minutes.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{new man here, sir.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{oh, yes. bring him in.}
<A>__{holmes goes into his office. warden jerks his thumb toward the door. prewitt goes into the office. warden follows him.}
<L>__{interior captain's office day}
<A>__{holmes is seated at his desk as prewitt and warden enter. a placard on it reads: captain holmes. a smaller desk nearby has a placard' reading: 1st sergeant warden. warden seats himself at this desk. on the walls are framed photographs of prizefighters as well as one of a large golden trophy. on holmes' desk is a small framed photograph of a very attractive blonde woman. prewitt comes to attention in front of holmes' desk.}
<C>__{prewitt}
<D>__{sir, private robert e. lee prewitt reporting to the compny commander as ordered.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{at ease.}
<P>__{(takes papers out of}
<D>__{drawer, glances through}
<P>__{them)}
<D>__{they sent your service record over... twenty two years of age... born in kentucky... enlisted first at fort myer, virginia... bugle corps... re enlisted for overseas duty... fort shafter... first bugler...}
<P>__{(benignly)}
<D>__{prewitt, i always make it a policy to talk to my new men. it's important for an officer and his men to understand each other. now i have a fine smooth running outfit.}
<B>__{angle featuring warden}
<A>__{holmes cannot see warden who is grinning at prewitt with unholy glee.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{plenty of room for advancement for a man who knows how to soldier. but he's got to show me he's got it on the ball. i don't know what you've been used to in the bugle corps, but in my outfit we run it by the book. what kind of trouble were you in over there?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{no trouble, sir.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{what made you transfer out, then?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{it's a personal matter, air.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{oh. i see...}
<A>__{he studies prew for a moment, sees warden on the edge of his chair, watching hawk like.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{something you wanted to ask, sergeant?}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(explodes suddenly)}
<D>__{who? me? whv, yes, air. you had corpral's stripes in the bugle corps, prewitt. you took a bust to buck private to transfer to an infantry compny. why? because you like to hike?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i dint have no trouble if that's what you mean.}
<C>__{warded}
<P>__{(grins suddenly)}
<D>__{or was it just because you couldn't stand to bugle?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{it was a personal matter.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{that's up to the compny commander's discretion to decide.}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(looks straight at warden)}
<D>__{all right. i was first bugler at shafter for two years. the topkick had a friend who transferred in from the states. next day he made him first bugler over me.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{and you asked out on account of that!?}
<C>__{prey}
<D>__{maybe i just ain't sensible... but that's the reason.}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(snorts)}
<D>__{his feelings were hurt! kids they send us now!}
<A>__{warden swings his chair around, absorbs himself in work at his desk as if the prew situation is too absurd to concern himself with. holmes speaks blandly, winningly.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i've got a mighty sour company bugler here... but i suppose you wouldn't want that job.}
<C>__{prey}
<D>__{no, air.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{well, we'll get your stripes back for you, maybe an extra one for good measure. you know why you were sent over here when you requested transfer?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{holds}
<D>__{i pulled a few strings. i'm the regimental boxing coach, prewitt. i saw your fight with connors in the bowl year before last. with any luck you should have won it. i thought for a while, in the second round, you were going to knock him out.}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(tense)}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<B>__{medium close shot holmes}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{my regiment got beaten last year in the finals, as you know.}
<P>__{(savage insistence)}
<D>__{but i mean to win this year. and i will. all i've needed was a top middleweight.}
<P>__{(waves at pictures)}
<D>__{next year i will hang your picture up there with the others, my boy.}
<B>__{medium shot featuring prew}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i'm sorry, air. but i quit fighting.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{quit fighting? when? what for?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i just stopped, sir... after maybe you heard about what happened...}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you mean that fallow you hurt the one that went blind?}
<B>__{close shot prew}
<A>__{prew's lips are drawn tight. he nods almost imperceptibly.}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{during this shot maggio can be seen in b.g. through door to orderly room. he pretends to be sweeping, but stops now and then to listen.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{yes, it's too bad about that. i can understand how you feel. but those things happen in this game. a man has got to accept that possibility when he fights.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{that's why i decided i would quit, sir.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(less warmly)}
<D>__{but on the other hand, look at}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it this way. what if all fighters felt like that?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{they don't.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{would you have us disband our fighting program because one man got hurt?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{no, sir. i dint say }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you might as well say stop war because one man got killed. our fighting program is the best morale builder we have off here away from home.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i don't want it disbanded, sir.}
<P>__{(doggedly)}
<D>__{but i don't see why any man should fight unless he wants to.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it looks to me like you're trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf, prewitt. you should know that in the army it's not the individual that counts. if a man wants to get ahead he has certain responsibilities to fulfill that go beyond the regulations. it might look as though i were a free agent, but i'm not. nobody is.}
<A>__{holmes waits hopefully for a moment, then realizes prew is not going to respond further. he stands. prew snaps to attention.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{maybe you'll change your mind. in the meantime just don't make any mistakes in my outfit.}
<P>__{(to warden)}
<D>__{i've got to go into town. is there anything else for me today, sergeant?}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(holds up papers)}
<D>__{yea, sir! the compny pond report's got to be made out. it's due tomorrow }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you make it out. is that all?}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(holds up more papers)}
<D>__{no, sir!}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{well, whatever it is, you fix it. if there's anything that has to go in this afternoon, sign my name. i won't be back.}
<A>__{he goes out, crossing warden's desk and knocking a wire basket filled with papers on the floor. in a moment, the sound of the screen door slamming is heard. warden picks up the papers.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{he'd strangle on his own spit if i weren't here to swab out his throat for him.}
<P>__{(to prew)}
<D>__{come on. i will show you the supply room.}
<A>__{warden goes out to orderly room, prew following.}
<L>__{interior orderly room day}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{as prew and warden enter and walk through. maggio bobs his head approvingly at prew.}
<L>__{exterior company street day}
<B>__{medium shot warden and prew}
<A>__{as they come out of the orderly room. prew hoists his barracks bags to his shoulders, balancing them delicately. camera trucks with him and warden as they walk down the porch.}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(one of his unexpected intense bursts)}
<D>__{know what you did just now?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{when you turned down dynanite holmes' boxing squad? you put your head in a noose. things are soft for a boxer in his compny. otherwise, you better know how to soljer.}
<C>__{phew}
<D>__{i can soljer with any man.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{this ain't the bugle corps this is straight duty.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i will take my chances.}
<A>__{a convertible, top down, drives by and pulls up outside the orderly room. karen holmes, a tall, lean blonde woman, gets out. her skirt hikes up a little as she goes up the stairs to the orderly room. warden and prew stop walking and watch her. karen stops, glances at warden momentarily, then goes into the orderly room.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{since when is this place gettin to be the royal hawaiian?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{who's she?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{his wife. captain holmes'.}
<A>__{they resume walking.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{you'll fight, prewitt. you'll fight because captain holmes got a bee in his hat he needs a winnin team to make mayor. and if you don't do it for him you'll do it for me. i only been in this outfit eight months myself but i learned one thing. my job is to keep him happy. the more he's happy the less he bothers me and the better i run his compny. so we know where we stand, don't we, kid?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i know where i stand. i don't believe that's the only way a man can get along.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{a man's got to make up his own mind and go his own way. it he don't, he's nothin...}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{maybe back in the days of the pioneers a man could go his own way. but not in our time, kid. today you got to play ball. you got to divide it all by two.}
<A>__{they have reached a dutch door, top half open. a sign over it reads: supply room.}
<B>__{medium shot shooting into supply room}
<A>__{supply sergeant leva is eating a candy bar with one hand and leisurely typing up a form with the other. he is a foolish looking man, about thirty five.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{lava! can't i once walk by this supply room and find you workin with both hands!}
<C>__{leva}
<P>__{(comes up to door)}
<D>__{i can't do no better on what you people pay me.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{draw some supplies for this man.}
<P>__{(to prew)}
<D>__{that's g compny barracks over there. get rid of your bags and come back here, and leva'll find you a cart to lug your stuff over in. save you makin four five trips.}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(surprised, pleased)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i just hate to see energy wasted. any kind. besides, you'll be needin yours.}
<A>__{prew walks off, toting the barracks bags. the bang of the orderly room door is heard and lava and warden look in that direction. long shot karen holmes from warden and leva's angle as she walks along porch toward them. she is at a considerable distance. karen is about thirty. she wears a sweater and skirt. she is aware the men are studying her.}
<B>__{medium close shot warden and leva}
<A>__{watching karen. leva leans over the counter.}
<C>__{leva}
<D>__{her and them sweaters.}
<A>__{long shot karen from warden and leva's pov as she continues toward them. as much as a man can make out, she is probably not wearing a brassiere. warden's and lava's voices, loud at first, get softer and softer the nearer karen gets to camera. at end of the shot, as she is only a few yards away, they are practically whispering.}
<C>__{warden's voice}
<D>__{army women... they're cold, they got no more warmth than a diamond. there's no pleasure in them...}
<C>__{leva's voice}
<D>__{yeah, but this one knows the score... like i been tellin you.}
<C>__{warden's voice}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{leva's voice}
<D>__{okay, not around here. but i was back at fort bliss with holmes. when they was married only a year or two. i heard plenty about the lady then. plenty.}
<C>__{warden's voice}
<D>__{you heard.}
<C>__{leva's voice}
<D>__{okay, never me. but a lot of them. i know some of the use she played 'around with, don't tell me.}
<C>__{warden's voice}
<D>__{i ain't tellin you. you're tellin me.}
<A>__{karen stops, a few paces from camera.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{good morning, sergeant.}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{lava watches, listens avidly but discreetly in b.g. during the dialogue, karen seems irritated by warden, who looks at her coolly, appraisingly, physically.}

<C>__{warden}
<D>__{captain holmes just went in town, ma'am.}

<D>__{what is it that makes you so efficient, sergeant?}
<C>__{warden}

<A>__{karen laughs suddenly, loudly.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i love that. well, good bye, sergeant.}
<A>__{karen turns and walks back up the porch toward her car. warden and leva watch her. when she is out of earshot leva speaks.}

<A>__{medium shot 22 karen, in a negligee, is seated at a dressing table, brushing her hair steadily, gracefully, enjoying the sensual pleasure of it. karen is a woman of moods and tempers, spontaneous, quick to impulse. a car is heard pulling up in the driveway, the motor stopping. karen's brush strokes become faster, rougher. the front door is heard opening and holmes' voice calling, "karen." she does not answer. holmes enters. he seems to have had a few drinks. through the following, karen continues brushing her hair.}
