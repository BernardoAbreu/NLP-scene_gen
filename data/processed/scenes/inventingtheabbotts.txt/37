<L>__{interior high school library day (spring, 1958)}
<A>__{doug steals lustful looks at eleanor from behind his book. she is seated across the table from him. the library is filled with students poring over their assignments. eleanor is seemingly oblivious to doug's probing eyes. doug allows his pencil to roll off the edge of the table. he ducks under the table to retrieve his pencil and his ruse is revealed as he stares up eleanor's skirt at the soft triangle that her white panties cover between her parted legs. eleanor's hand lowers a piece of notebook paper beneath the table, on it she has written: "hi doug!" doug starts with panic, rears back, cracks his head on the bottom of the table, and then, as his head rebounds from the blow, he accidentally impales himself in his chin with the sharp pencil. doug scrambles up from under the table with the pencil dangling from his chin, knocking over his chair in the process. the tranquility of the library is destroyed by the flabbergasted reactions of the students. eleanor is momentarily concerned about his welfare, but she cannot help but laugh, too.}
