<L>__{interior truck cab day}
<A>__{red sees amy and jeff flee the trailer and head for the utility pickup. he throws the peterbilt into a turn.}

<C>__{amy}
<D>__{jeff, go! go!}
<A>__{jeff turns the key. the engine catches! he throws the ford in gear and floors the gas. the ford shoots out of the peterbilt's path!}
<B>__{highway}
<A>__{the ford peels out of the driveway and joins the road, spewing exhaust. it's an old vehicle that doesn't maneuver well.}

<A>__{kicking up a cloud of dust as it pulls alongside the ford on the right hand shoulder. the driver, billy, is levelling a shotgun through the window.}

<B>__{on peterbilt}
<A>__{a stray bullet slices the hydraulic brake line running to the trailer. the hose hisses and whips through the air!}
<B>__{in peterbilt}
<A>__{red swears and lets the truck fall back, swearing. up ahead is a long, curving downgrade. he taps the brakes. there is a jolt as the trailer bumps the tractor.}

<D>__{hang on!}
<A>__{they are flying into a hairy curve.}
<B>__{in peterbilt}
<A>__{red struggles to stay in control. every time he applies the brakes, the unchecked trailer jars the cab forward. the peterbilt races into the curve. red has no choice. he has to pump the brakes and risk jackknifing or the truck will fly off the road altogether. he hits the brakes!}
<B>__{highway}
<A>__{the huge truck screeches on the asphalt, tires smoking, cab and trailer folding at right angles! then, unexpectedly, the trailer disconnects from the cab!}
<B>__{in cadillac}
<A>__{flanking the peterbilt, al glances to the side and sees the trailer come untethered from the cab. now the trailer is an unguided missile, weaving drunkenly back and forth across the blacktop. al tries to swerve away. the trailer streaks toward him. al slams on the brakes, screaming!}
<B>__{highway}
<A>__{the trailer piles into the cadillac. there is a huge impact as trailer and cadillac are reduced to scrap metal! and just as this is happening...}

<A>__{jams the pistol through the rear pass through window and fires at red in the truck. bullets ping off the grille. the gun clicks empty.}
<B>__{in peterbilt}
<A>__{red hits the brakes, but it's no use. the bumpers are meshed. the two vehicles plunge downhill, skidding sideways. up ahead, a concrete bridge spans a deep gorge.}
<B>__{highway}
<A>__{the peterbilt and ford fly onto the bridge. the big truck glances off a railing. the vehicles suddenly come unlocked. the ford plows into the concrete railing with a crash! the peterbilt creams it from behind and caroms away, skidding the length of the bridge before smacking the opposite railing!}
<B>__{inside road}
<A>__{jeff grimaces. in front of them, the concrete railing has broken away. debris falls 300 feet to the bottom of the gorge. the ford's right front tire hangs in the air. jeff looks at amy. she looks wildly adrenalated, eyes wide.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{you all right?}
<A>__{amy looks back at him. she expels a long breath and nods. jeff forces his upper body through the driver's window and looks over the ford's roof at the peterbilt. jeff's pov peterbilt it's facing them, 50 yards away on the bridge. the engine is dead. steam hisses from the crumpled radiator. one tire is shredded. there is blood on the broken windshield.}
<B>__{back to jeff}
<A>__{sitting in the driver's window. he squints toward the truck, searching for any sign of red. there is none.}

<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i mean i can't get out!}
<A>__{jeff blinks. he climbs out of the ford, runs around to amy's side and yanks the door. it comes open with a creak of metal. behind jeff on the bridge, a motor kicks over. he whirls. jeff's pov peterbilt exhaust belches from the smokestacks. red is behind the wheel. his face is covered with blood. he stares hatefully. with a rasp of gears, the peterbilt lurches forward.}

<B>__{on bridge}
<A>__{the truck is no longer hitting the ford squarely. instead, the peterbilt's right front tire is riding up and over the cargo bed, crushing the left side of the ford under its massive weight.}

<A>__{he headbutts jeff viciously crack! blood erupts from jeff's nose and mouth. red is about to deliver another blow when... ... the windshield falls away! the loose items in the cab plummet 300 feet to the canyon floor below. jeff drops through the windshield opening. he clings to the center support column. his legs dangle over the hood. red slips through the opening, his hand locking on the steering wheel at the last instant. the windshield sails away into the gorge.}
<B>__{on bridge}
<A>__{the iron rebar groans. it's beginning to give way under the weight of the truck. the truck slips slightly.}
<B>__{on peterbilt}
<A>__{jeff feels the truck shifting. he grabs the windshield wiper blade with his free hand. the blade snaps away. red is clinging to the steering wheel. he flails at jeff with his feet, swearing. jeff is barely out of reach. jeff looks to the side. there is a grabhandle on the corner of the cab. he reaches with his free hand and seizes the handle.}
<B>__{on bridge}
<A>__{the rebar groans. the truck is wedged against the ford. as the truck slips, it forces the ford closer to the edge.}
