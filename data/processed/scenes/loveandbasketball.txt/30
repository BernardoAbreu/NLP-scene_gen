<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{c'mon.}
<A>__{he pulls shawnee to the middle of the floor.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{monica, nervous at first, a little awkward, but jason gently guides her in a slow circle and she starts to relax. jason moves his hands down monica's back, pulling her in closer. shawnee snuggles into quincy's chest, runs her hands down his neck. the heat from bodies grows. monica and quincy glance up at the same time and catch each other's eyes. they start to look away but find they can't. eyes locked as they dance, they move together, almost feel each other. finally, as their bodies turn, they lose sight. monica puts her head to jason's chest, quincy slides his hands lower down shawnee's back. the music continues...}
