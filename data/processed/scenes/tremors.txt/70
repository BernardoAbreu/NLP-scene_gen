<L>__{exterior main street the pick up day}
<A>__{the truck shakes and shimmies as val's creature tries to pull it down. val sees that rhonda's in trouble. he searches frantically for a weapon and finds one a chain saw! he leaps as far from the truck as he can and hits the ground running, yanking furiously on the saw's starter cord.}
<L>__{exterior storage shed day}
<A>__{rhonda is in a dead panic, thrashing helplessly in the barbed wire. the beast takes another gulp of fence, wrenching her within inches of a probing hook tentacle! suddenly we hear a nasty roar as val's chain saw swings in, slicing the squirm ing tentacle in half, spraying gore everywhere! the creature unleashes an unearthly shriek, and the other tentacles recoil. the severed one writhes like a beheaded snake. val yanks off rhonda's boots.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{come on! outta your pants!}
<A>__{she frantically claws at her belt. but in mere seconds:}
<C>__{rhonda}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{tentacles snake out to regain their grip on the fence. val grabs the saw and starts slashing wildly, but this time the hook tentacles snag it and wrench it from his grasp. it slams to the ground, motor dying. the monster readies itself for the lunge that will suck rhonda in. val grabs her under the arms and pulls. rhonda wriggles wildly to get out of her wire enmeshed pants. the creature lunges! rhonda pulls free! she and val tumble backward. the creature gets only a mouthful of rhonda's jeans. the next instant the second creature explodes up through the ground right next to fallen val and rhonda! they roll sideways, come up running, and sprint for pham van's along an old wooden sidewalk.}
