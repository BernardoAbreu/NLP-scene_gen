<L>__{interior the press room at the intercontinental hotel later}
<A>__{the chaos of a busy, cramped telex room. a switchboard several journalists trying to place phone calls. press come and go coffee, cigarettes, and half eaten sandwiches. claire tears a story off the telex while price stands to the side of the action eating a sandwich and watching. alex stands at the center of it all established as the senior figure (or one of them) to whom other, younger journalists come for information. a young journalist, a time stringer, is slightly distraught on the phone, and interrupts alex's dealing with others, cupping the phone, to announce:}
<C>__{time stringer}
<D>__{...it's charlie, from new york says that a terrorist bombing of a central american restaurant isn't big enough to hold for the world section...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{tell him we have pictures.}
<C>__{young journalist}
<D>__{he knows.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{tell him there were pieces of body in the piano, and somebody was singing, "i left my heart in san francisco."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what's he got better than that?}
<C>__{time stringer}
<D>__{he's got the pope visiting egypt.}
<A>__{alex grabs the phone in disgust and launches in.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{forget the pope, charlie. every week you got the pope somewhere. this is a very big story down here because it's the first sign of fighting in managua.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yeah, well get a map and look up nicaragua ya drive to new orleans and turn left.}
<A>__{while charlie argues on the other end of the phone, alex initials papers and performs several jobs at once.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{like hell i'm editorializing, the whole thing happened in a roomful of c.i.a. and press. what do you want?!}
<P>__{(beats)}
<D>__{how do i know they were c.i.a.? they wore name tags, what do you think? we're backing a fascist again i know that ain't news, but see if you can find an angle!}
<A>__{hub kittle has been floating through the room and, upon hearing the word "fascist," takes offense and approaches alex.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{hey! there's fascists and then there's fascists, right? be careful how you throw words like that around.}
<A>__{alex ignores hub though he is slightly pestered by him, and continues on the phone as he initials papers brought to him.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{we don't have any pictures of rafael because nobody knows where the son of a bitch is, and anybody crazy enough to go after him...}
<A>__{alex spots price who is standing nearby, still eating a sandwich, still enjoying the high energy buzz of the room. alex directs his next line so that price cannot fail to get the message. alex plays the moment coolly.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{...is liable to get his nuts shot off.}
<A>__{hub nods seriously, in agreement. price turns. alex smiles. price smiles. alex hangs up, grumbling, then turns his attention to the persistent hub kittle.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yeah, well g'bye...}
<P>__{(to hub)}
<D>__{who the fuck are you?}
<C>__{hub}
<P>__{(extending a hand)}
<D>__{hub kittle. i'm with lewitsky and knupp new york. we have a client down here.}
<A>__{alex is irritated but fascinated.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{president somoza.}
<A>__{alex is incredulous that somoza employs a new york p.r. firm. hub is professionally used to this reaction no panic.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{i know, i know...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but there's an untold story here. i mean, the man has a point of view too, right?}
<A>__{alex turns to leave; hub corners him.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{we got a national anthem contest going on right now, and you guys are ignoring it. lotta human interest.}
<A>__{alex turns to other business though hub persists. elsewhere in the room a young nicaraguan woman, 18, is talking to claire. she seems to be part of the local press.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i want you to get me copies of the government inventory lists of all captured guerrilla weapons. i want to know if the guns are israeli, belgian, russian, cuban...}
<C>__{young woman}

<C>__{claire}
<D>__{fine give me proof.}
<A>__{a telephone operator calls to claire through the chaos.}
<C>__{operator}
<D>__{su hija, su hija! your daughter from los angeles.}
<A>__{claire sighs at the bad timing but seems delighted to be interrupted by her daughter, and brushes aside a stringer forcing paperwork upon her. claire takes the phone into a bare, adjacent hallway for some privacy. in a bare hallway claire talks to her daughter.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{hi, baby! how are you?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{has grandmother spoiled you silly by now? she has? good.}
