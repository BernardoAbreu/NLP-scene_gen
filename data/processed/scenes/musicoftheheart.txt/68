<A>__{the fifty fifth grade students play the "twinkle" variations. their playing is impeccable and they look terrific. as the camera pans the audience, we recognize: mrs. adisa, tears in her eyes as she watches naeem; mrs. lamb and her husband, watching becky in amazement; isabel and her daughter sitting with assunta, nick and lexi; janet, impressed as hell; and dennis, seething with jealousy. as the kids start the jazz variation of "twinkle," a woman elbows her husband:}

<A>__{the camera returns to the children and captures their own pride in their playing, including lucy, who smiles as she hears her song played by fifty. the concert time dissolve the students are now playing "allegro," and they reach the fermata. they hold their positions in silence and the audience watches in anticipation. roberta cues them and they play the next note in perfect unison. an involuntary smile lights on de sean's face. they finish the song, the audience applauds, and roberta turns to face them. she lights up when she sees how thrilled janet looks, and janet in turn raises her hands higher as she applauds roberta.}
