<L>__{exterior fire station 17 morning}
<A>__{brian stands there. it's his dad's station. turn of the century abused. sooty with stone gargoyles and a pair of faded red doors that suddenly crank open as brian comes up the drive. fire engine 17 and ladder truck 46, lights flashing, pull out onto the apron. the fireman sticking his head out of the passenger window is stephen. one look at the silver trumpet on his collar and we know this isn't fireman mccaffrey but fire lt. mccaffrey.}

<D>__{goddamn it, stephen...}
<A>__{brian bolts full out for the engine. at the last instant before he falls on his face a fireman reaches out and drags him aboard.}
