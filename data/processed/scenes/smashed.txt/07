<D>__{...'cause i feel like i understand what it's like to be homeless, ya know? i mean, if you didn't know me, if we hadn't connected tonight, you might think: "there's some upper middle class, npr listening, self congratulatory, insulated, lazy liberal bitch. probably never had to worry about anything." but that's not true at all! i grew up poor, man. single mother. mcdonald's used to have one day a week where they sold 29 cent hamburgers, and another day where they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. my mom and me would go there and she'd get twenty burgers that was the limit, probably set up for folks just like us and then she'd put `em in the freezer and we'd microwave `em for dinner throughout the week.}

<D>__{i was kinda overweight until high school, to be perfectly honest. eating used to be my thing. when i started drinking, though, i kinda stopped eating so much.}
<P>__{(back on track)}
<D>__{but anyway, the point is: you and me, we're not so different.}
<A>__{the two guys aren't paying much attention to kate. they're more concerned with their crack pipe.}
