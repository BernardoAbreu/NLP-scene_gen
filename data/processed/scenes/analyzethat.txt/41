<L>__{interior car moments later}
<A>__{ben starts the car and pulls away with vitti still slumped in his seat. once out of sight of the prison, vitti straightens and turns on ben, suddenly lucid.}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(enraged)}
<D>__{you fucking son of a bitch! where the fuck do you get off sticking me with a needle?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i knew it! i knew you were faking! you used me to get you out of prison!}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{took you long enough. i was singin' west side story for three fuckin' days. i'm half a fag already.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i call you to say somebody's trying to kill me and you hang up on me?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i was at the funeral home!}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{you're my fuckin' doctor!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{my father died!}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{me me me me! he's dead! get over it.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{are you hearing yourself?}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(perfunctorily)}
<D>__{i'm deeply sorry for your loss.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yeah, i can see how touched you are.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{what's the difference? you hated him anyway.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i loved my father. i'm feeling a lot of grief right now.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i'm not sensing it, but if you say so.}
<A>__{ben nervously pops a pill and swallows it.}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(re: pill)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{decongestant. i'm getting over a cold. all right, what's going on? who's after you?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i don't know take your pick. could be my old family, or could be the rigazzis. ever heard of lou rigazzi lou 'the wrench'?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why "the wrench"?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{because he twisted a guy's head off once.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{off?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{off. fuckin' calabrese animals. and comin' from me you know that's a big compliment.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm sure they'd be flattered. so }
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{the feds are really putting the pressure on. the families are fighting each other again what's left of 'em. it's the fall of the fuckin' roman empire. it's world war three out there.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{so what does that have to do with you?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{they knew i was gettin' out soon and the last thing anybody wants to see is me getting into it on either side.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{maybe if you just explain to them that you're out of it now, that you're starting a new life }
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{yeah, they'll probably want to throw me a party and give me a gold watch. trust me nobody's lookin' forward to me being out.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you are, aren't you?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{me? oh, yeah, my future looks real fuckin' rosy.}
<A>__{ben can't believe what he's gotten himself into.}
