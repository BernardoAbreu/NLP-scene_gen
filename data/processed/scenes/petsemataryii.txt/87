<L>__{interior geoff's room night}
<A>__{the clock is creeping up on 2am... thunder rumbles outside in the distance and rain starts to spatter the window panes. geoff's eyelids fall beneath unbearable weight and he nods off to sleep. tiger is sprawled out on the blanket against his chest. slowly, we move back towards the window... in a flash of lightning gus' face appears outside. washed in the haunting white glow. streaked with mud. caked with blood. staring in at geoff. geoff is jolted awake by the delayed clap of thunder and whips his gaze to the window. before he can focus... ...the pulse of lightning fades away. and with it, gus' face. only darkness remains beyond the window pane. geoff returns his gaze to the bedroom, unaware of gus' appearance. he sinks back to his pillow, already hurtling towards sleep once more.}
