<L>__{interior george's house day}
<D>__{the next morning, george gets up and goes to look from the window. the chauffeur has gone. george is a little sad, but that's just the way it is... he looks around at his home. a little later, george looks at himself in a mirror. we pass from him to his reflection, which he hides by placing his drink against the mirror.}
<L>__{interior auction rooms day}
<D>__{a sign says that the effects of george valentin are to be auctioned. furniture, costumes, objets d'art and paintings on september 14th. there aren't many people in the room, just five or six. george is standing at the back, smoking a cigarette. his position and demeanor are exactly like when he was watching the screening of tears of love, from the back of the room with the verdict of failure in the air... he's looking a little unsteady on his feet, probably due to the hip flask he's necking that seems to contain liquor. the objects go under the hammer one by one. we see the three monkeys go by, notably, hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil. two buyers especially are raising the prices by bidding against each other, a distinguished and reserved looking man, and a lady of a certain age who looks a bit severe, to the point of bigotry. they don't seem perfectly comfortable, but they are the only two buying. a few crossfades (the display table emptying, faces, hands being raised, hammer falling, "sold" labels) show us the lots disappearing every single item is sold.}
