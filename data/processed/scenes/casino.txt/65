<C>__{ace }
<D>__{like these yokels here who never heard of nicky or the bosses back home, 'cause they're the morons who give you the most trouble. even after we'd catch 'em, they'd try sneakin' back with beards and wigs and fake noses.}
<A>__{ace and sherbert walk up to watch the winner who is playing all six hands at the blackjack table.}
<C>__{ace }
<D>__{you can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet. like this guy. he's bettin' lavender chips at five hundred each with only one little problem. he's always guessed right. if he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd have been tougher to spot. but in the end, they're all greedy.}
<A>__{ace walks around the winner's table, past the crowd, to the pit. behind him are more blackjack tables, dealers and players. ace bends down and ties his shoelace.}
<C>__{ace }
<D>__{i saw that the dealer was weak, but he wasn't in on it.}
<A>__{the dealer's hands lift the corner of his hole card a half an inch to determine the casino's hand against the winner. the slightly exposed hole card is a six of clubs.}

<B>__{overhead dolly in on signaler who appears to be nervously tapping his thigh.}
<A>__{we see through his trousers, that he is tapping a copper transmitter with a battery pack attached. back at the winner's table we see inside his pant leg where a device strapped to his leg is receiving the impulse signal buzz buzz buzz from the signaler.}
<C>__{ace }
<D>__{and that's just what these hustlers look for. they cruise from casino to casino, lookin' for weak dealers the way lions look for weak antelope.}
