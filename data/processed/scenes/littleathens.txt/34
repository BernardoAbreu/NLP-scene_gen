<L>__{exterior county road morning}
<A>__{a police car is sitting off the road, positioned to surprise unsuspecting speeders. the lone occupant, derek, twenty, about 6' tall with athletic build, in his police officer uniform, is reading the sports section of a newspaper.}
<L>__{interior derek's police car continuous}
<A>__{ots on derek as he turns the page and continues reading the sports section. a young preppy high school punk speeds by in a corvette the radar gun reads 93 m.p.h. as he passes, the punk looks straight at derek, mouth open, clearly surprised by derek's presence. derek picks up his head and returns the stare of the surprised punk as he passes.}

<D>__{whoa.}
<P>__{(returning to the sports section)}

<A>__{derek's cell phone rings. he reaches down, fumbles around, and brings it to his ear.}
