<L>__{interior tavern night}
<A>__{the place is in an uproar everybody doubled up with laughter as the two luckless hoods, handcuffed together, are lying on the filthy tavern floor under a table. they continue to berate each other. eddie enters.}

<A>__{eddie shakes his head and walks to the back of the room where kosalas sits hunched over a drink, the only man in the room not laughing. he looks up whens eddie pulls over a chair.}
<C>__{kosalas}
<D>__{beer?}
<A>__{eddie nods, and kosalas signals the waitress. there is a long beat at kosalas fidgets and eddie waits.}
<C>__{kosalas}
<D>__{looks like i'm caught between the rock and the hard place, sarge.}
<A>__{eddie just looks at him.}
<C>__{kosalas}
<D>__{you know i really wanted to be a good cop, but... shit. it's hard enough sometimes just to stay alive. comes so easy to you. you got all the fuckin' answers. me, i'm still tryin' to find the questions.}
<A>__{eddie is still silent. kosalas takes a swig of his beer, and finally blurts is out.}
<C>__{kosalas}
<D>__{cragie planted the gun on the kid. just wasted him, and then i... i don't know what to do about the hearing tomorrow...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{tell the truth.}
<C>__{kosalas}
<D>__{see. it's all so nothin' for you. if i talk straight every cop on the force will shit on me. if i don't... cragie gets away with murder.}

<D>__{it cost an innocent kid his life.}
<C>__{kosalas}
<D>__{i know that! i know that!}
<A>__{he is too loud, and attracts attention.}
<C>__{kosalas}
<P>__{(softly)}

<C>__{eddie}
