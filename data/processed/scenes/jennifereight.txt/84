<L>__{84: exterior yard. house. day.}
<A>__{berlin clears rubbish from the garage. grime and sweat and the effort's got him breathless. heaves another armful on the fire. the phone starts ringing again. this time he decides to answer.}
<L>__{85: interior corridor admin. police station. day.}
<A>__{berlin in a hurry to get there. footsteps tell the story. fast up a corridor and through a door. faces look as he crosses the department. secretaries and bisley and ross. but only one face of interest. taylor turns halfway through lighting a cigarette. "are you outta your fucken mind?" taylor says nothing. "if any thing happens to that girl, i'm gonna break your fucking back."}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{just easy on the words you're putting in my face, sergeant ..}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{whass going on here?}
<A>__{a question practically every expression in the place is asking.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{his blind friend got "attacked." angelo went up there, and some how, it got itself in the paper.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{you put it in there.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i may have said some thing. i don't recall.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{don't lie, taylor. i just had this blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment you gave him the whole damned case!}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{alright, i gave him the case? .. so the case is closed, so what?}
<A>__{his indifference inflames berlin. smashes the newspaper at him.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{so read it! you just hung a target around her neck!}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{don't you know nothing about this guy? he reads the newspapers. col lects the cuttings. when are they gonna find her? now he's reading helena robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. you couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{just walk away from me, taylor ..}
<A>__{now the volume is going up. now the whole department is silent.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{you think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? i was a big city cop too. and i bust ed the clock on fucken jennifer. i know more about this man than you'll over know and that's how i know it ain't him you 're investigating a soap opera ..}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{alright, guys. we stop this now.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{he tells her, "bye bye," and she gets "attacked." well, give me a fucking break! there is no "ser ial killer." stick her name up in neon, there's still no serial kil ler! and i ain't the only one say ing it. everyone in this building is saying it. and i mean everyone.}
<A>__{"everyone" means ross. berlin looks at him. and his gaze hurts.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{shut up, king jay ..}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{no, c'mon, freddy, let's have this out & over. you know what everyone thinks? they think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. and no one's blaming you for it, i hear she's worth the flowers. but don't come in here get ting holy over us. sure i put it in the paper. coz i wanted to stop this bullshit. i don't want you drunk out ta your head searching my office ag ain. it's pissing me, & everyone off.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{you don't know what you done, taylor.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{if, your friend from san diego was up here, and thought for one out of two fucken seconds, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..}
<A>__{his cigarette is already stubbed and he's already walking away.}
<D>__{why don't you get yourself a dict ionary? look up the word "witness?"}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i know what a "witness" is.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{well, her, it ain't. that bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.}
<A>__{a big mistake mister taylor. mister berlin suddenly turns into harrison ford. taylor slams into filing cabinets right next to the christmas tree. gets berlin's forearm under his throat and fucking lucky not to get the knuckles in his gut. both men are heaving. no volume necessary in this room of paralyzed silence.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i'm gonna do something you never did, taylor. i'm gonna catch this bastard. and when i do, he's gon na find out just how good a "wit ness" she is .. meanwhile, you be aware of me coz i wish you ill ..}
<A>__{berlin moves away and the silence is brutal. nothing happening but bad vibes. ross and berlin exchange glances, and this shit is really bad. berlin vanishes into his lab and the door slams.}
