<L>__{interior mansion ballroom night}
<A>__{a negro jazz band pumps out an african rhythm to incite the anglo saxon libido. bobby stands before the band, "conducting". on the floor, frank hangs on to his cool blonde.}
<B>__{in the entry hall}
<A>__{a porcelain skinned beauty shrieks in delighted terror as she races up a massive marble staircase. halfway up she stops. at the bottom of the stairs, bugsy stands with his arms across his chest, feigning indifference. the beauty's panties bounce off his face. bugsy charges up the stairs.}
<B>__{on the terrace}
<A>__{charlie leans against a pillar looking out across the lawn toward the long island sound. behind him, white curtains billow out through the french doors to the ballroom, as though blown by the force of the music. charlie lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{you come to parties to be alone?}
<A>__{charlie looks around, but sees only the billowing curtains. a breeze lifts them higher, and a woman in a long white dress materializes beneath. somewhat older than the other women at the party, and far more elegant. she speaks in a cultivated accent of indeterminate european origin.}

<D>__{why are americans always so desperate to have a good time?}

<C>__{gay orlova}
<D>__{for being a man.}

<B>__{two negro chauffeurs}
<A>__{idle away their time under a tree next to the line of cars parked around the drive. behind them, the rear door to a limousine stands open. bugsy's feet, trousers around his ankles, can be seen braced on the ground below the door.}
<B>__{shooting through the windshield of the limousine}
<A>__{bugsy's pants meld with the moans of the beauty, behind the screen of the front seat.}
