<L>__{exterior central crater day}
<A>__{the crater floor is a vast enclosed plain. the pyramidal mount looms in the center colossal in scale. the rovers enter the crater, trailing plumes of dust. they circle the pyramid. on the south face of the pyramid, an iris door of many blades stands, easily fifty feet high. seemingly made of the same basaltic stone as the pyramid itself. a huge construction. the explorers are transfixed in awe. all skepticism banished.}

<D>__{undeniable proof of alien civilization. you were here on this day, thirty one december, year of our lord 2172. history will remember your names.}
<A>__{watts stares at the iris. its bottom most blade is broken; it lies in rubble at the foot of the door. a dark knife like aperture leads into the pyramid.}
