<L>__{exterior marina del rey day}
<A>__{it's raining lightly in the harbor and the water around the moored boats looks dirty and cold. we pick up a sad excuse for a boat sitting in an end slip. it's a sea gull shitcovered, thirtyfoot cabin cruiser that hasn't cruised in a long, long time. a ratty looking unpainted plywood addition has been nailed to the top of the cabin. it's partially covered with a blue plastic tarp. superimpose: marina del rey, california }
<B>__{fall}
<A>__{the tarp moves and shane falco's half naked torso emerges from under it. shane is late twenties, golden boy handsome, but quickly going to seed. he looks hung over. shane glances up at the sky and rain. he pulls on the top part of an old patched wet suit and zips it up. he shivers.}
<L>__{exterior marina del rey harbor day}
<A>__{we're buzzing around the harbor with shane in an old zodiac inflatable dinghy. shane has pulled up the attached rubber hood to his wet suit so that only the white, pasty oblong of his face is visible. it's still raining as he steers the little boat around the sailboats and yachts. he pulls up to a fiftyfoot sailboat and cuts the engine. with practiced moves, he ties the dinghy to the rear rail of the sailboat and clips a bill for services rendered on the sailboat's stern line. he slips on a weight belt, puts on a pair of old gaffer taped goggles, jams the end of a air hose in his mouth, and falls backward out of the dinghy and into the water.}
<L>__{exterior underwater day}
<A>__{it's dark, dirty and murky. suddenly, shane floats into frame and comes at us with a long spatula.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{he attacks the underside of the sailboat which is covered with green algae muck that hangs a foot off the bottom of the boat. the spatula scrapes away the green mess revealing the pure white underside of the boat.}
<B>__{close on shane}
<A>__{as he scrapes. muck from the boat floats past him. this doesn't look like fun. as he works, he happens to look down and notices something on the bottom. shane's pov amidst the beer cans and other trash, something golden is sitting on the bottom.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{shane takes a deep pull on his hose, lets it go and drifts down. a shaft of sunlight penetrates the murky water and reveals a broken trophy half buried in the mud. shane kneels over it and picks it up. the trophy is almost a full size football rendered in bronze attached to a broken base. shane turns "the ball" over in his hands. he grips the seams like he's done this before. then he holds the football out in front of him. suddenly, he starts barking garbled signals to an imaginary offense. he turns to his running back as he yells something like "blue}
<L>__{31!" it comes out in bubbles}
<A>__{he cocks his left leg and his wide receiver goes in motion. then on the "snap" he turns and starts a five step drop. he moves in slow motion because hey... he's underwater! he executes a perfect play action fake on the third step of his drop, and looks "down field" for his receivers. but there's a blitz! he steps up in the pocket but a linebacker's arm almost takes his head off. he dodges, he bobs, he weaves in a kind of delicate ballet. he rolls left and keeps looking for the open man. suddenly he points down field, pulls up and cocks his arm. the "ball" comes behind his ear and snaps forward in a perfect release. the trophy spins out of frame but we hold on shane as he watches his pass. suddenly, he throws both arms up in a touchdown signal. we stay on him as he freezes in this pose of victory, fifteen feet underwater, on the trash covered, muddy bottom of marina del rey.}

<A>__{bam! a miami dolphin linebacker crushes a washington redskin running back and lands on his throat, elbow first. it's a beautiful fall day in november and miami is beating the skins in front of seventy six thousand crazed washington fans. the redskins are at their home stadium better known as "the big o."}
<L>__{interior control booth day}
<A>__{john madden and pat summerall are calling the game in shirtsleeves.}
<C>__{summerall}
<D>__{that play, my friends, sums up the redskins' running game all day long. now washington calls their last time out.}
<A>__{madden leans over to do his diagram that shows up on your tv screen. we stay on him as he draws and explains.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{hey, the dolphins do this as good as anybody. see, in a four, three, two, two, you got the guards... boom!... plugging up the middle, then the corners... boom and boom! are free to box... leaving the middle linebacker to cut off the trap here... boom!}
<C>__{summerall}
<D>__{third and twenty two, but forget the first down with eight seconds showing and the skins down by a touchdown.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{could be the last play.}
<C>__{summerall}
<D>__{could be the last play of the season if the players go out.}
<L>__{exterior sidelines day}
<A>__{redskin quarterback eddie martel is conferring with redskin head coach bud tildon near the bench. madden and summerall continue over.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{take it all in, people. this could be it for 2,000.}
<A>__{we move to veteran redskin center reese evans, 38, standing on the sidelines, uniform totally clean. he looks near tears.}
<C>__{summerall}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{once again, if you haven't heard, it was announced during halftime that the n.f.l. players association will hold a press conference immediately following this game that would make it about five o'clock eastern time and it is expected that the players' union will announce a strike effective immediately.}
<B>__{on redskinettes}
<A>__{twelve striking looking women dressed in burgundy and gold are doing some inane chatter to a section of fans that ignore them. the girls are led by pretty annabelle farrell, a bundle of manic energy inside a body from heaven.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{it's all about money, folks. more money, of course and ain't it always? the shame of it is the big losers are you out there, the fans.}
<B>__{on martel}
<A>__{the redskin quarterback moves to the huddle.}
<C>__{summerall}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{here we go: third down, eight seconds to play, ball on the dolphins' thirty three yard line. skins down by a touchdown.}
<A>__{the huddle breaks and martel sets up over the center.}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{green 48! green 48! hut! hut!}
<A>__{the ball is snapped and martel drops back. he looks for a receiver and doesn't see anybody. he steps up in the pocket, sees an opening and takes off running down field.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{there goes martel!}
<A>__{martel is a pretty good broken field runner for a big guy. plus with the defense covering every possible receiver, he's got a lot of daylight. nobody has touched him as he crosses the fifteen. suddenly, a safety, smaller than martel, looms in front of him at the ten. martel goes down in one of those wimpy quarterback slides before the safety can even hit him. bang! the gun sounds and the game is over.}
<B>__{on madden and summerall}
<A>__{they look at each other in disbelief}
<C>__{summerall}
<D>__{well... martel goes down ten yards short of a score.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{on maybe the last play of the season.}
<C>__{summerall}
<D>__{i think he might have slipped.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{yeah, there's a lot of that going around.}
<B>__{on three redskin fans}
<A>__{we'll see these guys throughout. they're typical low level washington bureaucrats named todd, rod and bob who live for the hogs the traditional name for the redskin offensive linemen. todd is shirtless and his entire upper body is painted redskin red. at that moment, they are livid with their quarterback and bob is speaking for them all.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{we're coming to your house tonight, and we're gonna fucking kill you! and if you got a dog, we're gonna kill your fucking dog too!}
<B>__{on annabelle}
<A>__{behind her, the rest of the cheerleaders are already walking away. annabelle looks at quarterback martel with pure disgust as he walks off the field.}

<L>__{interior large bedroom day}
<A>__{the room's blinds are pulled tightly against the bright sunlight. only the blue light of a tv illuminates anything. suddenly, we hear an old man in the bed give out with a loud piercing wail. the door to the room bangs open and an english male nurse named augustine ripley, dressed in white, comes running in. he's carrying a syringe in each hand, poised at the ready. he runs to the bed of the still wailing edward francis o'neil (75). o'neil is hooked up to an oxygen tank, watching the just completed redskin game with the sound off.}
<C>__{augustine}
<D>__{did they win or lose?!}
<A>__{o'neil continues to wail.}
<C>__{augustine}
<D>__{that has the distinct tonal quality of a loss.}
<A>__{he puts one needle down and jabs o'neil with the other one. he murmurs to the old man as he injects him.}
<C>__{augustine}
<D>__{nice medicine for a loss. keeps us calm. makes us not so sad. keeps us on an even keel. gives us some perspective, doesn't it? and we'll save the winning medicine for next sunday, won't we?}
<A>__{he finishes.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{if you keep talking to me like i'm a five year old, i'm going to hurt you.}
<C>__{augustine}
<D>__{sounds exciting.}
<A>__{he reaches for the phone and hits the speed dial.}
<C>__{augustine}
<D>__{we'll want to talk to coach now, won't we?}
<A>__{he hands the phone to o'neil.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<P>__{(on the phone)}
<D>__{what the fuck was that?!}
<L>__{intercut with: interior tildon's office}
<A>__{coach tildon sitting in his office. we can hear players getting dressed, listening to music and getting showers outside his open door.}
<C>__{tildon}
<P>__{(on the phone)}
<D>__{i think he slipped.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{bullshit he slipped! he could have scored! anybody could have scored! i got one foot in the god damn grave and i could have scored!}
<C>__{tildon}
<D>__{mister o'neil, let's face facts: the players are going out. it's gonna happen. and nobody wants to get hurt on the last play before a strike that could go on for the rest of the season.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{you god damn wimp! you're fired! get out! get out! get out!}
<A>__{o'neil throws the phone down. augustine picks it up and then cranks up the oxygen a notch. o'neil takes big gulps of the rich air.}
<C>__{augustine}
<D>__{better? it always makes you feel better when you fire someone, we know it does, don't we? yes...}
<C>__{o'neil}

<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{hey, man, i do what my union says.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{but you're already one of the highest paid players in the game. the fans just don't see the point of a player like you striking.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{let me tell you something: i'm a big man, you see?}
<A>__{wilson holds his arms out. yes, he's gigantic.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{there are some days when i am so beat up, that i cannot dress my own big ass. i asked management for a valet or some shit to help me dress and they said no way. so, fuck 'em!}

<A>__{a handsome ex player named jerome lindell steps up to a podium at a press conference. he's wearing a two thousand dollar suit. on the tv he is identified with a super: "jerome lindell president national football league players' association."}
<C>__{lindell }
<D>__{i have just left a meeting with representatives of the owners and i am sad to say that they have refused the players' final demands which center around a rise in the current salary cap. lindell (v.o.) (cont'd) therefore, i am recommending that all n.f.l. players walk out and not play until our demands are met. i want the players to walk out tall, to walk out righteous, to walk out in the knowledge that we do this as a team. we shall overcome the fat cats. i send peace to my union brothers.}

<D>__{mcginty you look like shit.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{i'm dying, jimmy. mcginty you been dying for twenty years.}

<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{we're gonna finish the season anyway. all of us owners decided. we're gonna use replacement players. mcginty you're a bunch of greedy bastards, aren't you?}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{us, greedy?! what about the god damn players?! i got the highest payroll in the n.f.l. and they still want more! mcginty that's because you've been bottle feeding straight cash to these big babies for years.}
<A>__{o'neil sips his whiskey and calms down.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{no team owner in their right mind is gonna give back those t.v. revenues.}
<C>__{o'neil }
<D>__{all we promised fox was twenty two guys with a pulse every sunday. but think about it, jimmy. we got a great opportunity here! we got a chance to put a team on the field that plays the game just for the love of it. like we used to play it. mcginty we also used to play without face guards.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{jimmy, i'm really dying. the doctor says i will be gone by superbowl sunday. help me bring a winner back to d.c. you did it for me once before. you can do it again. mcginty listen: i golf once a week with the president of the united states. i walk my grandkids to school every day. i got a young wife who will fuck me any time i want, which frankly, isn't too often, but it's comforting to know it's there. i don't need it.}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{come on. wouldn't it be fun? a bunch of poor nobodies who play to win instead of a bunch of bitchy millionaires? you can put it together, jimmy. player's love you. they always have.}
