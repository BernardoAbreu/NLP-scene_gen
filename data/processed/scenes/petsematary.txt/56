<C>__{jud}
<D>__{you folks ready to go on?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{but where are we going, mr. crandall?}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{you'll see soon enough, hon.}
<A>__{they go into the woods, still following the path.}
<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{these are old woods indeed huge trunks with dusty sunlight shafting through them. it looks as though man has never made his mark here. the camera pans slowly down to them, on the path. here it is carpeted with pine needles, but it is just as clearly marked. jud stops. louis looks glad of the rest; he's sweating and there are wide dark patches under his arms where the gerrypak's straps are.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{who owns the woods up ahead? paper companies?}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{nope. the micmac indians. what's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.}
<C>__{ellie }
<D>__{micmac, ricmac, kickmac, sickmac.}
<C>__{jud }
<D>__{ayuh, it's a funny word, ain't it? you tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{not yet...how much further is it?}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{aw, you'll be okay. less than a mile.}
<A>__{he starts off again, fresh as a daisy. ellie scampers after him. louis rolls his eyes at his wife and rachel rolls hers back. then they press on.}
