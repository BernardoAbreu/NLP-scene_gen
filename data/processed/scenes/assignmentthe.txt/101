<A>__{ramirez turns to enter the barracks with a wide angle of the landscape overlooking the dead sea. he now wears a black t shirt and black jeans. the peugeot is parked near the barracks that sits on the edge of the cliff in b.g.}
<L>__{interior safe house dead sea sunset}
<A>__{start tight on a shot of an ashtray. it is overflowing with cigarettes. a woman's hand picks up the butt that is in the ashtray and with the last of its ember she lights another cigarette off it. she is carla, mid thirties, hard edged which mars the beauty she still has. she is intense, neurotic and bitter. she and ramirez are alone in the living room. she sits in a corner. we become aware of the room. it is a study in contrasts. light shoots in through shell holes and cracks in ruined walls. and yet, the interior is somehow soft, sensuous, with thick carpet, muslin drapes and a large bed that resembles at one and the same time, a boxing ring and an altar. she pays no attention to ramirez. she doesn't even acknowledge that he's entered the room. she is in a kind of reverie.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{the thing about carlos is... he doesn't lose himself with a woman... not with a lover... maybe with a whore i don't know... i wasn't his whore. lovers are different to him... he might have a use for them... so he has to seduce them properly. he has to make sure they're so crazy about him they'll do anything for him.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{when did you...?}
<A>__{she holds up a hand without looking at him, commanding his silence.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{shhh! you're not here.}
<A>__{she rocks herself back and forth, comforting herself and now for the first time we see the bottle of irish whiskey she holds at her side. she raises it, takes a long gulp, some of the fluid dripping down the corner or her mouth. she doesn't bother to wipe it away. it is there next to tearstains on her cheeks. slowly, her rocking back and forth, her primal comforting, the act of an abused and abandoned child will turn into strokes, caresses of a secret style from a phantom lover who will get her in the mood for what she must do. she must get herself wet. she must get herself ready. she must recapture what it is to be seduced by carlos. her hand is her lover now.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{you don't exist until i'm ready to let you exist, and then... you do exactly what i say.}
<A>__{she leans her head back and conjures carlos up in her mind.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{it's not pleasure for him... it's... it's... it's... this sick kind of conquest... you know this seduction... he's got to make you not just a lover but a disciple... a worshipper... he brainwashes you with his body... so... so... you'll do anything... you see because he's the perfect lover... he does it all to... not to please you... but to excite you... to... to make it dangerous for you and then, that's very sexy too, to a woman... that danger... like he could kill you in a second... but instead he makes you come... so he's almost killed you, you see? and you have this orgasm right then and it's like he's killed you and there isn't anything left of you and he makes you be born again the way he wants you to be. so there isn't a thought in your brain that he hasn't put there. not a feeling in your body that he hasn't put there.}
<A>__{she masturbates herself stopping just short of climax. then she looks up at ramirez, acknowledges his presence and lets him exist.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{take off your clothes.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{just like that?}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{look mister...}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{miguel...}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{i don't want to know your name... i don't want to know anything about you okay. this isn't fun for me. i'm not here to play soft music and be romantic. i'm here to help you kill him... at least i hope that's what you're going to do. they promised me it was.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{take off your clothes.}
<B>__{angle on ramirez}
<A>__{he takes off his clothes. camera shoots from the waist up.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{you're smaller than him.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{carla slaps him suddenly without warning hard across the face.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{that's what he would have done if i would have said something like that. without a moment's hesitation. what's wrong with you?! no eres ni hombre!}
<A>__{ramirez back hands her and she flies backwards against the couch.}
<B>__{angle on carla}
<A>__{lying against the couch. her mouth is bleeding just a little.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{now come to me and kiss where you hit.}
<A>__{she puts her finger to her lip and sees the blood. ramirez bends down to her, the passion rising.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{kiss where the blood is and then smear it on my lips so i taste it.}
<A>__{ramirez bends down and kisses her and the blood smears and he kisses her passionately.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{now go down on me... yes like that... si... si... tease me... tease... but don't let me come... control me... it's got to be when he wants it... yeah...}
<A>__{ramirez's head goes down out of frame.}
