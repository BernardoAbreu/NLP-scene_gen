<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{the groundskeeper}
<A>__{mumbles the lord's prayer under his breath. watson immediately goes into doctor mode checking his pulse, looking in his eyes. the groundskeeper just keeps praying. watson takes a boiled sweet from his pocket, pops it in the man's mouth and gently sits him down. holmes walks over holding a small branch from a tree.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{he's in shock. we should give him a few moments.}
<A>__{lestrade stomps up.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{the witness stated that he saw lord blackwood rise from the grave.}
<P>__{(at watson, accusingly)}
<D>__{well? you pronounced the man dead.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(stung)}
<D>__{he had no pulse.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{inspector, do you know if this is a spruce or a sycamore?}
<A>__{lestrade shakes his head. it hasn't been a good day for him, or the yard. there's a clunk. they all turn to see the coffin has been extracted from the crypt. four beefy, soil stained cops emerge lugging the coffin. they place it on the ground, step back, crossing themselves, murmuring, plainly terrified. holmes chuckles.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{open it!!}
<A>__{but no one moves. the cops pass a crowbar around as if it were red hot. watson's had enough. he marches forward snatches the crowbar away, jams it under the lid and levers it off with a slow, eerie groan. holmes and lestrade move forward, the cops move backward. the coffin is filled with earth, overflowing. they brush away a layer of dirt, to reveal... a dead body in the coffin. the body is a much smaller man than blackwood, in everyday clothes, with red hair.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{that's not blackwood.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{now that we have a firm grasp of the obvious...}
<A>__{watson opens his forensic kit, disturbed. vials, silver tools. he takes a caliper, begins examining the body.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{lividity is late stage. diptera deposits are approximately }
<P>__{(measuring)}
<D>__{ three quarters of an inch, putting the time of death at ten to twelve hours ago.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{inspector, may i see your pen?}
<A>__{lestrade hands over a nice fountain pen, still stunned. holmes takes the pen and pries open the corpse's mouth, revealing: two missing teeth in the man's jaw.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{missing two incisors in the upper jaw...}
<P>__{(a look at holmes)}
<D>__{adler's midget.}
<A>__{holmes spots something glinting in the man's dirt filled pocket. he uses the pen to fish out: a pocket watch.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{all yours, inspector.}
<A>__{holmes hands the pen back to lestrade. lestrade looks at it with dismay, takes it in holmes' handkerchief a small measure of revenge. holmes and watson begin walking away from the crypt. lestrade follows, anxious. holmes shows him the dusty pocket watch.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{scratches around the keyhole where the watch is wound. most drunks are the same, and pawnbrokers scratch the ticket number and their initials inside the lid. this one has five, so the owner }
<C>__{groundskeeper }
<D>__{he was walking.}
<A>__{they all stop, suddenly. the old groundskeeper stands in front of them, ready to unburden himself.}
<C>__{groundskeeper}
<P>__{(quivering voice)}
<D>__{he was walking but his feet didn't touch the ground. and i'm not daft, i know what i saw and i know lord blackwood. he was as alive as you or me. it's not right. it's not natural.}
<P>__{(turns, leaves)}
<D>__{our father who art in heaven...}
<P>__{(etc.)}
<A>__{all three men watch the groundskeeper go. a sudden gust of wind moans eerily. they all want to get the hell out of there.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{now the game is afoot, watson.}
