<L>__{interior cardboard box night}
<A>__{jean tries to sleep in the box. rain falls heavily onto it. drops of water hit his face. he wills it to stop. it doesn't. finally, he can't stand it. rain forces his blinking eyes open.}
<L>__{interior benny's apartment night}
<A>__{a door opens to reveal jean's wet face. benny lets him in. jean enters a rundown railroad flat crammed with musical instruments, beer cans, and homemade art. there's a couch with a sheet over it. junk is piled in a corner mostly art books and drawings. benny sits down at an electric piano, which he's evidently playing. he sings along, softly, working out the words, concentrating, absorbed. jean sets his belongings on the couch, walks to a mic stand and starts making up his own words.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{"she loves me. oh yeah she loves me! she loooooooves me, oh yeah she loves me!" bring me some chicken, baby!}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{would you shut the fuck up? you hear what i'm doing?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{yeah man. i'm jealous. you're always great, benny.}
<P>__{(goes back into 'act')}
<D>__{"her name is g i n a gina and she lo oooves me." i did say chicken!}
<A>__{benny turns off the piano and lights a roach, angry at jean's self centeredness. jean digs through a pile of garbage. finally, he finds what he's looking for a pile of "samo baseball cards" color xeroxes of his favorite images and words. he pockets them.}
<C>__{basquiat }
<D>__{i knew i left these somewhere. one of these'll send your kids to college someday.}
<P>__{(hands it to benny solemnly)}
<D>__{here i made this for you.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{your dad called again something about a job.}
<A>__{he hands jean a slip of paper. he notices the number on jean's pants.}
<C>__{benny }
<D>__{you got a date already?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<P>__{(exhaling)}
<D>__{we're getting married. she said she could tell i was a great artist she could see it in my eyes. she said she wanted to be by my side and have inter racial babies with me.}
<A>__{benny grins. he grabs a basketball and spins it expertly on his index finger.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{g'night... see you in court tomorrow.}
<A>__{jean turns on the tv. he notices the roach. he picks up the paper benny gave him with the message from his father and sets it on fire. he lights the roach with it. he looks up; on television, we see a bum being interviewed. jean turns up the volume. the bum's on the ground, looking beat up. jean picks up a pocket recorder and turns it on:}
<C>__{bum}
<D>__{the guy just hit me and i was on the ground!!!! boom, for real.}
<A>__{jean mutes the sound on the tv. he rewinds and proudly plays back the words "boom, for real." he picks up the phone and dials. he turns on the speakerphone. jean holds the recorder to the speaker as someone answers the phone. (jean walks in and out of frame throughout the following.)}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{i is this the s s suicide h h hotline?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{yes. my name is chris. what's yours?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{jean michel.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{that's a beautiful name. french?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{haitian. i'm going to kill myself. i'm taking pills. reds, blues, greens.}
<A>__{jean opens his notepad and looks down a long list of seemingly random words. he comes to the words (in order) "liquid, hijack," and "marlboros."}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{what? wait a minute... talk to me.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<P>__{(about to sob)}
<D>__{life doesn't... make... sense. this city's k killing me. i want my liquid hijack marlboros!}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{what? life's beautiful. depression isn't permanent. don't you believe that?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what is it did your girlfriend leave you?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{no! i have a boyfriend. he loves me.}
<A>__{jean spies an electric pencil sharpener and plugs it in.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you see? you have someone to live for.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{no, i don't. i'm alone. we all are. especially here. the world's unjust. the respect fools get. the disrespect i get.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{what is it you want? respect? i have respect for you, just for making this call. one philosopher said "sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." think about it. feel it.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{you don't even know me. i want real respect.}
<A>__{he jams a pencil into the electric sharpener and holds the receiver right next to it, giving the guy an earful: rrrrkkkkkkk!!!}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{close up a speaker. it fills the screen. we continue to hear:}
<C>__{chris }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what? what do you want?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<P>__{(breaking loose)}
<D>__{fame. my liquid hijack marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.}
