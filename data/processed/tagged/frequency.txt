<L>__{exterior little league baseball field morning some years}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{we are soaring high above a baseball diamond. clear light air, you can see for miles. float down to the field... the first taste of spring and softball. picnic baskets. flowers. kites flying. children running. the bleachers filled with families and loved ones. among them sits samantha. she's smiling, she's glowing...she's pregnant. pull back to reveal satch, gordo, ellen & gordy jr. a dalmation puppy scampers at their feet, barking in recognition as... frank sullivan steps into the batter's box.}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{pitcher: 22 year old african amerasian, a muscular beanpole. embroidered on the back of the his fdny jersey is his nickname: phire power. quick shot of first baseman. graham gibson once a nervous probie, now a seasoned vet. and one hell of proud father.}
<C>__{gibson}
<P>__{(to pitcher)}
<D>__{take it easy on him son, he's older than moses.}
<A>__{frank sneers at gib, then glances up at gib's wife in the bleachers. she looks familiar, it's the girl frank saved in the warehouse 29 years ago. phire power twirls his arm... frank takes a big swing...contact...the ball fouls back behind the plate. towards the parking lot. where among the old chevys and fords sits a brand new mercedes. the custom license plate reads: yahoo. crash! frank's foul ball comes down hard. as the mercedes' windshield spiderwebs we hear an off camera scream... it is gordo, jumping up, running across the field. from the parking lot his eyes meet frank's. an i'm sorry shrug, and frank turns his attention back to the game. the next pitch is high and outside. frank takes a looping swing...driving the ball to the gap in right center. frank jogs to first. an easy single. from first, frank glances over at the third base coach: julia. her hair pinned up under a mets cap, julia puts two fingers in her mouth and belts out a loud whistle as... the next batter steps out of the dugout. it is john sullivan.}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{john as he makes his way to the plate. check out his eyes: they're different, he looks like his father. they've got that frank sullivan sparkle. john steps into the batter's box, cocks back to wood.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{bring me home, son! bring me home!}
<A>__{phire power uncorks the fastest softball pitch you've ever seen. john jumps on it. rips a massive shot to deep center, way over the fence. the crew in the stands are on their feet, cheering. frank rounds third, john catches up. a double high five from julia and they jog home together. the game is over. frank puts his arm around john. heading for the bleachers. a little boy totters up to them. jumping into john's arms. his name is frank jr.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey there, chief.}
<A>__{john gives his son a kiss, glances up at samantha in the bleachers. they share a smile. and as they step off the field, his little boy reaches up, takes john's hat off his head and puts it on his own...}
<C>__{frank jr.}
<D>__{elvis has left the building...}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{john's face. in his eyes, bliss. cue bruce springsteen's: take me out to the ballgame.}
<T>__{end credits roll over:}
<A>__{archival film footage. 1969 world series. game five. the last pitch. mets win. shea stadium erupts. fans stream onto the field. lifting the players on their heads. the madness continues for a while, then slowly fade to fifth ave. mets' ticker tape parade. it's a hell of a party.}
