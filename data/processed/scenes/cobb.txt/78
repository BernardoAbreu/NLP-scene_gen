<D>__{shut this man up!}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{the man with the gun does the talking, you wretched, old prick...}
<A>__{long shot car racing down the highway in the snow, and we go out hearing willie recount the greatest ballplayers of all time all of them black as cobb seethes, a gun to his head. stump feeds willie, watching cobb's racism simmer. into the storm the car disappears fishtailing down the mountain. the blizzard grows thicker, the flurries taking over the mountain, until all we see is the thick snow falling from the dark sky. suddenly }
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{ice! slow down! tyyyy!}
<A>__{pov steep downgrade as slick as a bobsled run.}

<A>__{wobbles and starts spinning out of control, then spinning continuous 360s down the grade.}
<B>__{close on three men}
<A>__{the world spins around them as they cling for their lives. until: thud the car slams into a bank of snow. suddenly, silence. the three men sit without speaking for several beats, slowly acknowledging that they have survived. finally:}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{fucked up roads. they don't build highways like they used to.}
<A>__{pov hotel sign in distance glows a welcome sign in the night. it is no longer snowing.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{well, mr. cobb, thank you for a lift into town...}
<A>__{willie hands the gun to stump and climbs out of the car, bidding farewell to stump as he does.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{and you, sir, should leave this disgusting, wretched, sorry son of a bitch immediately. good evening.}
<A>__{willie tips his hat and trudges to the neon glow in the distance. cobb and stump alone in the car. they both look out the car is buried, hood deep, in the bank of snow.}
