<D>__{isn't it quiet?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{sam, you ever think that if people knew how crazy you really were, no one would ever talk to you?}

<D>__{all the time. so, you want to put on these glasses? they'll protect you.}
<A>__{sam puts her arm around his shoulder. protecting him. charlie looks through the glasses. the sky bends like a globe. when he breathes, the sky ripples.}
