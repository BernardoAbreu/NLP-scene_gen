<D>__{we've transferred her to a higher security room on the fifth floor. that's my final concession to any type of special treatment.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{and the night staff?}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{they insist her room was properly locked, what else could they say?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{could there be any truth to her claim?}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{peter, we have one hundred and forty employees. thirty five work maintenance. they all wear yellow shirts, it's their uniform. i'm holding a very discreet inquiry, sure but i don't want a news van parked outside day and night. it makes much more sense that she tried to escape and got caught, doesn't it?}
<A>__{pete ponders this. it certainly seems that way.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i perused miranda's files on chloe mcgrath they're damn comprehensive. maybe she was a bit obsessed with her.}
