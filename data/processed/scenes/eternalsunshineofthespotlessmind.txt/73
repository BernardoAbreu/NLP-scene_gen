<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{the kitchen is dated and vague. joel and clementine are in an oversized playpen; they're adults but small. joel wears footsie pajamas with some vague little animals on them. he holds a a red furry huckleberry hound doll. clementine is still in her panties and bra. an oversized woman in high heels, seen from a low angle, hurries back and forth preparing dinner.}
