<L>__{25: interior crime lab. police station. night.}
<A>__{a florescent glow from a t.v. monitor supplies the only light. berlin vacillates interest between the scanner and the screen.}
<C>__{citrine }
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{laser enhancement of the finger tip .. it's really bothering me .. see these striations right here?}
<P>__{(green on the screen)}
<D>__{it's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?}
<A>__{but citrine isn't interested in finger nails. he's staring at a polystyrene torso of a faceless girl. she wears a brassiere stuffed with newspaper and a black wig. (welcome jennifer two)}
<D>__{she's almost identical to jennifer. slim white same age bra size is even the same. nicely made lady.}
<A>__{citrine stares at the dummy like he's gonna ask it a question.}
<C>__{citrine}
<D>__{how do you know her hair's black?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{hair on her hand. plus jen nifer had raven black hair.}
<C>__{citrine}
<D>__{what is all this jennifer stuff?}
<A>__{he waves a handful of teletype before dumping it on a bench.}
<D>__{these cases aren't connected, john?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{yes, sir, i think they maybe. i think "jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?}
<C>__{citrine}
<D>__{i don't see that at all ..}
<A>__{on the board is a super imposed picture of a hand over a wrist.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i got four points of posit ive comparison on the cut ..}
<C>__{citrine}
<D>__{yeah, that's all very inter esting, but where's the body?}
<A>__{a question he doesn't need because he hasn't an answer. citrine has an eye on further photographs relevant to the jennifer case.}
<D>__{i don't know nothing about this "jenn ifer" girl, cept what some of the guys told me but principal feature of the case was a gruesome displayal of the body. he wanted it found. so if this is the same guy, why's he hidden this one?}
<A>__{another question he can't answer and this time he doesn't get a chance bisley walks in with an apology for the interruption. got a face like humphrey bogart's mother fucked a different guy.}
<C>__{bisley}
<D>__{just wondered if you had time to get around to my pharmacy stuff?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{you'll have it in the morning ..}
<C>__{bisley}
<D>__{alright, i will try again tomorrow.}
<A>__{bisley has gone but his tension stays. berlin unwraps fresh gum.}
<C>__{citrine}
<D>__{probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. he worked a lotta time on this.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i thought it was taylor's case?}
<C>__{citrine}
<D>__{sucked in officers from all over the county. and it was the worst six months this station ever had.}
<A>__{this is citrine's shop and berlin isn't gonna row it with him.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{what do you want me to do, chief?}
<C>__{citrine}
<D>__{i'm not telling you what to do. what i will say, is right now, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..}
<A>__{he refers to a little bicycle. vouchered and obviously stolen. by now citrine is at the hinges. a pause before he disappears.}
<D>__{why don't you give it a minute, & stop by my office. we should talk.}
