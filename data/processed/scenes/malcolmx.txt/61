<L>__{interior the cell corridor day}
<A>__{it is the afternoon lockup: about 3:30 p.m. the line of prisoners stands in front of their cells, as two guards, wilkins and barnes, one white, one black, slowly walk past the p.m. check. the procedure is routine, done without emotion, as it is done three times a day: the black guard calls out the prisoner's name, the prisoner answers with his number, then steps into his cell. whereupon the white guard slams the door shut and locks it.}

<C>__{prisoner}
<D>__{a 231549.}
<A>__{door is slammed and gate locked. close malcolm each time a gate is locked his tension increases. his face is a mask hiding his fury, violence and the hunger of an advanced junkie who has not had a fix in over a week.}

<C>__{second prisoner}
<D>__{a 5991301.}
<A>__{same procedure. angle. shooting past malcolm, favoring two other prisoners. the guards are approaching malcolm's cell. past malcolm are two experienced prisoners who have been watching malcolm during the scene. they whisper surreptitiously without moving their bodies, and barely moving their lips. one of the prisoners is pete, a huge barrel of a man, a lifer beaten by the system and a lifetime of incarceration. the other is bembry, a man of no great physicality, but who possesses immediately the gift of leadership. it is clear that pete and others look up to him with great respect.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{looka satan.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{i see him.}
<A>__{bembry's language is very unhip. he speaks carefully. he respects words and he respects himself, something which sets him apart from all the other prisoners.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{he bout to bust.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{no, he's not gonna bust. but he's not gonna fix his face to please them, neither.}

<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{he's a new fish, mr. barnes. give him a break.}
<A>__{it's a bold step by bembry and the prisoners look over at him with admiration. barnes accepts the irregularity and calls over to bembry.}

<A>__{close malcolm}
<C>__{malcolm}

<A>__{shaking his head in anguish. he knows what's coming. angle. barnes makes a small gesture and wilkins seizes malcolm, grabbing his head and uniform at the same time. stenciled on the chest of his faded dungarees is malcolm's number. the guard bends malcolm's head to the number, shoving the material in malcolm's face.}
