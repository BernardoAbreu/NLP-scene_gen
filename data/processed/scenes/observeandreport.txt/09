<L>__{interior mall security office morning}
<A>__{ronnie is in the room with the monitors. the skaters sit across from him. there's a poster on the wall with the security guard motto: observe and report. ronnie fiddles with his walkie talkie.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{it seems like we go through this every day. what's it going to take for you all to realize that i won't tolerate this horseplay and just do whatever you want to and don't worry about the rules attitude?}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{ronnie, i hear what you're saying and i just want you to know that personally, it pains me to see you all worked up and i just want you to know that i'm really sorry because you can't do shit and you can take your little rules and stick'em up your ass, you fuckin' rent a cop.}
<A>__{the skaters all start cracking up.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{yeah, suck my dick.}
<A>__{the skaters start laughing louder.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that's funny, guys. i try to be a mentor to the youth, but it seems like you boys have gone straight past boydom to the land of street hardened criminals. i'm left with no choice. you call me rent a cop, but i call myself the law's right hand. i see the crime... and i phone it in. and that's what i'm getting ready to do right now.}
<A>__{ronnie picks up the walkie talkie and turns it on. he speaks into it.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(into walkie)}
<D>__{317, this is ronnie barnhardt over at carolina mall. come in, over.}
<C>__{walkie voice }
<D>__{this is officer douglas, what do you wish to report? over.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(into walkie)}
<D>__{i've got a couple of trespassers who have been found skateboarding on mall property. can you send a black and white over to take these boys into processing? over.}
<A>__{ronnie winks at the skaters.}
<C>__{walkie voice }
<D>__{uh... yeah, ronnie, we're kind of busy today. i mean, we got like three car accidents.}
<A>__{ronnie picks up the walkie and whispers into it.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(into walkie)}
<D>__{what do you mean? i've got these guys red handed. i'm gonna need a car over here pronto. i can't hold them all day by myself. over.}
<C>__{walkie voice }
<D>__{copy. yeah, like i said, we're awfully busy right now. i think you should probably just make'em promise not to do it again and threaten to call their parents or something. that'll get them. over.}
<A>__{the skaters start laughing.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(into walkie)}
<D>__{sir, i don't think you understand, their parents don't care about them. this is a 911 from one of your soldiers. officer needs assistance! over!}
<C>__{walkie voice }
<D>__{yeah, it's not gonna happen...}
<A>__{the voice fades as ronnie turns off the walkie.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{so as you can see, the law is just one little call away. but i'm gonna choose not to use that tactic today. i'm gonna do something that i like to do from time to time, and that's called handle shit myself.}
<A>__{ronnie takes his pad out of his pocket. he begins writing.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{while i won't have you arrested today, i am going to suspend each of you for one week. for those of you who don't know how this works, here it is. this is official documentation. if you step foot on mall property, it is considered trespassing. at that point, i call the police, they come down, you go directly to jail.}
<A>__{ronnie fills out the paperwork, sets the suspension notes on the table. stevie looks down at it. he picks it up, reads it, balls it up, and throws it at ronnie. the skaters start cracking up.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you accepted it originally, so it still counts.}
<A>__{ronnie sits there while the skaters laugh.}
