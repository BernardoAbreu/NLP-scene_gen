<L>__{interior penthouse living room day}
<A>__{edward enters the living room. vivian slowly enters behind him. edward opens the front door. mr. kross slowly enters. he looks very old and tired; so much so that edward has to mask his surprise.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{mr. harris.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{how are you, mr. kross.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights. i will get used to it.}
<A>__{an angry, reluctant looking david kross is behind his father. stuckey brings up the rear. edward and david give one another perfunctory nod. stuckey smugly winks at edward. edward closes the door and leads them all down the stairs. vivian is very troubled at kross's appearance. he gently nods at vivian.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{young lady.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{hello.}
<P>__{(to david)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hello, vivian.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{let's not waste time here, shall we? mr. kross, you said this morning, you wished to speak with mr. harris. mr. harris is now listening.}
<A>__{kross has to fight down his humiliation at stuckey's tone. he turns to edward.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{yes. i'm here to tell you that i've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{expected... offer.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{of course, yes. after the expected filing period is over, i'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{you're making the right decision, sir.}
<A>__{stuckey glances triumphantly at edward. he is surprised to see that there doesn't seem to be any victory in edward's face. edward is silent. kross interprets his silence as second thoughts.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{i will see you on one condition. i'm not so concerned for me but the people who have worked for me...}
<A>__{vivian is disturbed watching this tired looking man.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{they'll be taken care of. won't they, edward?}
<A>__{kross ignores stuckey. he looks to edward. edward slowly nods.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{i will sign anything you want then.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{today.}
<A>__{kross nods tiredly. his voice is very soft.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{today.}
<A>__{vivian abruptly turns and disappears into the bedroom, obviously upset. the men all watch her go. edward hesitates. he turns to kross:}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{excuse me, please?}
<A>__{he heads to the bedroom.}
