<A>__{sarah rolls up sebastian's sleeve, revealing empty air. she wraps a bungee cord around the nothing, pulls it tight and sprays the inside of his elbow with dye. she acts very self conscious.}

<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{yeah. why?}

<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{just felt like someone was staring at me.}
<A>__{sarah pulls the vial off the needle and labels it with a grease pencil. after a few beats the red dye in sebastian's blood stream dissolves and disappears, as does the liquid in the vial.}
