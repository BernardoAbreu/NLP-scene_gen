<L>__{exterior mountain wall wide shot day hal and gabe}
<A>__{have led the gang further up the wall, using pitons and carabiner clips to create a guide rope. it's still just a matter of climbing relatively easy ascending ledges. hal and gabe lead them by jumping to the next ledge.}
<B>__{closer on hal and gabe}
<A>__{as gabe hammers in a new piton, he turns to hal.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{we don't have to do this. we know these mountains they don't. if we can get ahead }
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{can you climb faster than they can shoot?}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{we've got to try something. think we'll get a finder's fee after they get all their "luggage"?}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{sure. all the bullets we can eat.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{that's not what really worries me.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{there's something else to worry about?}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{yeah. once they've got what they're after they're gonna need a copter to get out of here.}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{maggie.}
<A>__{gabe nods grimly and keeps moving up. the rest keep pace.}
<B>__{the wall}
<A>__{the climbers have reached a point of comparative comfort on the wall the ledge is now two feet wide. travers takes out the tracer monitor the monitor shows that the first case is just above them.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{hold it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's up there.}
<A>__{"up there" an overhang juts out of the wall fifty feet above their position. as the rest of the wall above is completely sheer, it's obvious that the case, if it is above, has landed on top of a ledge. but this isn't easily accessible we move down from the overhang and can see there are only the smallest of handholds to get up there, and those are slick with ice and snow. worse, the rest of the mountain bulges outward in a curve, making climbing almost impossible.}
<B>__{on the ledge}
<A>__{travers holds his gun on gabe, and motions up}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{fetch.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{i will need the ice axe.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{you've got to be kidding.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{okay. how about some tape?}
<A>__{travers nods kynette pulls a roll of tape out of gabe's confiscated pack and throws it to him.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{crampons too.}
<A>__{travers hesitates, but nods kynette throws him the iron spikes. gabe fastens them to his boots. gabe looks up this is going to be tough, even for him. in spite of the cold, he takes off his gloves that's how small these holds are and he meticulously tapes up his hands and his fingers. high angle gabe moves up the wall with some ease at first there are hand sized handholds, and decent footholds but twenty feet up, there's nothing. to keep going, gabe has to painfully wedge his fingers into small cracks, essentially supporting his weight only by several fingerholds at any given moment. we can see from the angle that gabe is at least 3,000 feet from solid ground. we can see from his face that he's trying not to think about it. on the ledge travers and qualen watch gabe's slow progress.}
<C>__{qualen}
<D>__{i don't trust him.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(indicating wall)}
<D>__{where could he go?}
<C>__{qualen}
<D>__{i'd rather he didn't show us.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we don't need two guides.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{you win. kill him when he gets down.}
<A>__{gabe on the wall close make that "if he comes down". gabe is now in one of the worst positions possible for a free climb. he is moving up the underside of the overhang and is essentially hanging upside down, knifing his fingers into tiny cracks for support. it's excruciating both in terms of muscular effort, and the abrasions that come from forcing fingers into ice and rock again and again. gabe keeps his hold with one hand and slides the other up, hammering it into a crack wedge with ice some of the ice chips whistle past and down finally, gabe gropes one hand over the edge, and pulls himself onto}
<B>__{the overhang}
<A>__{exhausted, gabe pulls himself prone across the top. something hard is underneath him gabe recovers and brushes the snow off the money case that's underneath. it's battered from the fall, but is still barely holding together. gabe manages to force open the trashed locks he looks inside the case, and fingers a band of $5000s.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{on the ledge travers and qualen look up. they can see gabe has made it but they can't see him, or the case.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(impatient, shouting)}
<D>__{lower it down now!}
<A>__{on the overhang gab has no intention of doing this he snaps the case shut and looks over at a ledge that moves off from it and at the ice and snow above. on the ledge travers and qualen's pov try to look up and locate gabe. they can't. until }
<C>__{gabe }
<P>__{(shouting down)}
<D>__{i've got a better idea. why don't you come up and get it?}
<A>__{with the case, gabe moves, back against the wall, on a ledge that skirts off the overhand from travers and qualen's point of view. gabe can hardly be seen since the mountain bulges out as it goes up. gabe's got a slight edge of cover.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(shouts to heldon)}
<D>__{get him!}
<A>__{heldon runs along the lower ledge, firing up at }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{who has to flatten against the upper ledge bullets howl past at twenty per second, sparking against the lip of the rock it's cover, but not much }
<B>__{hal}
<A>__{looks up, worried hal's pov ice and snow piled by the ton from the storm, lie further above the ice holding it back already, already weakened by the sun, is being chiselled away by bullets on the lower ledge qualen grabs hal and puts the gun to his head.}
<C>__{qualen}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{bring the money down, or we kill your friend!}
<A>__{travers pushes the barrel away from hal, shaking his head.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{we can't.}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{and he knows it.}
<A>__{wider angle on mountain the parallel ledges gabe moves across his thing ledge as heldon runs across his gabe ducks back and has to flatten even more against the wall, because his ledge is getting smaller }
<B>__{heldon}
<A>__{smiles, seeing gabe's cover is gone heldon's ledge is getting wider, so it's easier for him to fire up. heldon moves out to the edge gabe's pov down there's now nothing between heldon and gabe heldon takes dead aim }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{looks up, sweating it }
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{come on }
<B>__{the ice and snow}
<A>__{above finally give way, dropping an avalanche on}
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{who drops the case and hugs the wall the avalanche wide view on mountain only now can we see how much snow and ice had been penned up on the mountain top tons of ice and snow sweep down the mountainside it shatters the case against the wall as it easily swipes a screaming heldon off the ledge travers, qualen and hal are safe at their vantage, but stunned at the sight of }
<B>__{the avalanche}
<A>__{heldon's machine fun fires uselessly as he's swallowed in an explosion of white as well as a flurry of green as the bills scatter amid the snow then: quiet. the avalanche ends as abruptly as it started. the rumble dies down to complete silence.}
<B>__{travers}
<A>__{apoplectic, stares at seventeen million dollars worth of snow settling far below. he takes his gun, furious, and fires at}
<B>__{the upper ledge}
<A>__{where gabe was hugging the wall it's now blanketed with snow. travers fires an entire clip at where gabe used to be. the snow falls away, revealing nothing but stark rock. gabe has been swept away.}
<B>__{hal}
<A>__{reacts and attacks travers.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{you son of a bitch }
<A>__{travers turns and pins hal against the wall with the gun, ready to kill him too. but he's stopped by qualen.}
<C>__{qualen}
<D>__{no. we need him to get the rest of the money.}
<P>__{(he isn't backing down)}
<D>__{if he dies we lose everything}
<A>__{travers, furious, takes the gun out of hal's face.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(to hal)}
<D>__{get us out of here.}
<A>__{hal stares at travers with absolute fury but he leads the gang back along the ledge in retreat.}
