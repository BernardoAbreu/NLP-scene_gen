<A>__{bud comes in, shutting the door behind him, stands rooted to the spot for a moment. then he takes some pencils out of his breast pocket and drops them into a container on the desk, closes his account book, slams a couple of open file drawers shut. as he crosses to the clothes closet, the connecting door opens and sheldrake comes in, key in hand.}
