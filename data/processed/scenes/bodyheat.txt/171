<L>__{interior entry hall walker house day}
<A>__{matty has been pushed roughly across the entry hall. her back hits hard against the wall at the front of the central hall. she rubs her wrist where the skin is red and looks with frightened eyes at racine.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{don't say that. don't say you don't have them.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i swear to you, i don't. what's wrong with you?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{they had to be here when you cleaned up that night. think about it, think hard. they've probably got my prints on them.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i must have missed them. i wasn't looking for them. i thought they were on edmund.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{so where could they have gone?}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<P>__{(suddenly, a look)}
<D>__{betty!}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{the housekeeper?}
<P>__{(matty nods, thinking)}
<D>__{where would she have put them? you've been through his things. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{she might have taken them.}
<A>__{racine thinks that's crazy.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{listen to me. that's why i fired her. after edmund's death she started acting strange. she was always watching me, listening to my calls.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{that's crazy. you imagined it. i know, i've been imagining things, too. plenty.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{no, ned, not with her i wasn't. i could tell there was a difference. maybe she know about us. maybe she wants something.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{don't you think we would have heard from her by now?}
<A>__{matty walks over and sits at the bottom of the steps. she looks up at him.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i don't know what to think. i'm worried. but it's not about the glasses. or your friends. it's us.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{your first reaction is to accuse me. what's happening to you? i don't know if we can hold on like this.}
<A>__{racine sits next to her. he rubs his eyes.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{hardin called today. he said everything should be cleared up by next week. i will get the money}
<P>__{(a caustic smile)}
<D>__{he apologized for the delay.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{they've been stalling. they're draggin it out, hoping they'd come up with some way to implicate you.}
<A>__{matty turns and leans against him, looking into his face, full of love.}
<D>__{converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{but they haven't been able to. soon it'll be all ours. that's why we've got to hold together, ned. it won't be long, then we'll get away from here. out from under all this.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{all we have is each other. i'd kill myself if i thought this thing would destroy us. i couldn't take it.}
<A>__{his arms enclose her.}
