<A>__{a riffly blur, color alternating with black and white. the dizziness stops on a book page showing a black and white rendering of eight species of shark. the banner at the top of the page reads: the known and reputed maneaters. the riffling begins again, stops on a grizzly photograph of scar tissue on six former shark victims. riffling stop. photograph of five ichthyologists posing on wooden stools, framed by the enormous jaws of a prehistoric shark from the family carcharodon charcharias.}
<B>__{brody}
<A>__{his reading glasses reflecting a stack of twelve library books, all on the subject of sharks and shark attacks. the door opens and ellen enters, quietly, in respect for brody's mood.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{can you stand something to eat?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{love a cup of tea. with lemon.}
<A>__{ellen walks past brody to the window and looks out the window which overlooks the south bay. it is the hour of dusk.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{mikey loves his birthday present.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(with a slight laugh)}
<D>__{he's sitting in it.}
<A>__{brody gets up, concerned, and joins her at the window.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{honey. he has it tied up to the jetty with a double knot.}
<A>__{brody's point of view michael is sitting in the boat, but two of his young school chums are in the water, swimming around it. brody opens the window and calls down:}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{son! out of the water now!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{my boat's neat, dad!}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(turning to ellen)}
<D>__{i want him out of the ocean.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{it's three feet deep, martin}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(angry now)}
<D>__{michael! come inside!}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{it's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, honey. i told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. i don't believe he'll ever do it again.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...}
<A>__{ellen's eyes drift down to the open book, which is displaying a reproduction of the famous painting "the gulf stream," showing a black fisherman in a small dinghy similar to michael's being assaulted by the jaws of three man eating sharks, circling his boat.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{you heard your father! out right now!}
<B>__{sunset on the beach}
<A>__{hendricks and another deputy are assisting brody. silhouettes of townspeople look on like mourners at a funeral. in the background some workmen are taking down the shutters from a quaint summer cottage. they pause to watch the declining moments of the day. three selectmen also stand watching. one of them seems to be whispering bounty news to three youngish men on a nearby dune. sounds: surf and hammering.}
