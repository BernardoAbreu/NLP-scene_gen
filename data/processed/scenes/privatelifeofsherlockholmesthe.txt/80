<A>__{holmes and gabrielle are sitting on a blanket, the contents of the picnic basket spread before them, having lunch. watson is pouring the wine. their bicycles are resting nearby.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{we have so far investigated eight drafty castles had our bicycles attacked by sheep and our ears assaulted by bagpipes and we are exactly where we started.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(to gabrielle)}
<D>__{would you like some cranberry sauce, dear?}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{yes, dear.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{would you pass the cranberry sauce, please, john?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{yes, dear.}
<A>__{as he does so, he catches sight of something o.s.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{i say there. good afternoon. remember me?}
<A>__{on the road above, approaching a bridge which spans the lake where it narrows into a stream, are the seven trappist monks, walking slowly in single file. watson waves to them, but the monks pay no attention to him.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(to holmes)}
<D>__{some chaps i met on the train. we had a long conversation or rather, i had a long conversation because they're not allowed to talk trappists, you know. just study their bibles. you'll never guess what the one next to me was reading the book of jonah isn't that odd?}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(looking after the monks)}
<D>__{quite.}
<A>__{as he turns back, he notices that gabrielle is manipulating her parasol in the air.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{what is it, dear? what's the matter?}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{a bee.}
<A>__{she continues to work the parasol, alternately opening it and partially closing it. on the bridge von tirpitz, who is at the rear of the file of monks, glances back toward the lakeshore.}
