<L>__{int nite: flamingo suite (1955)}
<A>__{they are seated around the lavish table in michael's suite. michael is speaking to johnny.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{johnny, the corleone family is thinking of selling out all our interests in the olive oil business and settling here. moe greene will sell us his interest so it can be wholly owned by friends of the family.}
<A>__{freddie seems anxious.}
<C>__{fredo}
<D>__{mike, you sure about moe selling. he never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i will make him an offer he can't refuse.}
<A>__{michael turns to johnny.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{johnny, the don wants you to help us get started. we figure entertainment will be the big factor in drawing gamblers. we hope you'll sign a contract to appear five times a year for maybe a week long engagement. we hope your friends in the movies will do the same. we count on you to convince them.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{sure, i will do anything for my godfather. you know that, mike.}
<A>__{there is knock on the door. neri rises, looks at michael, who nods. neri opens the door, and moe greene enters, followed by two bodyguards. he is a handsome hood, dressed in the hollywood style. his bodyguards are more west coast style.}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{mike, good to see you. got everything you want?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{the chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!}
<P>__{(to his bodyguards)}
<D>__{draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{is my credit good enough to buy you out?}
<A>__{moe laughs.}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{buy me out?...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the hotel, the casino. the corleone family wants to buy you out.}
<A>__{greene stops laughing; the room becomes tense. neri eyes the bodyguards.}
<C>__{moe}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{the corleone family wants to buy me out. i buy you out. you don't buy me out.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{your casino loses money. maybe we can do better.}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{you think i scam?}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(the worst insult)}
<D>__{you're unlucky.}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{you goddamn dagos. i do you a favor and take freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you took freddie in because the corleone family bankrolled your casino. you and the corleone family are evened out. this is for business; name your price.}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{the corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore. the godfather is sick. you're getting chased out of new york by barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here. i've talked to barzini; i can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(quietly, deadly)}
<D>__{is that why you thought you could slap freddie around in public?}
<C>__{fredo}
<P>__{(his face turns red)}
<D>__{ah mike, that was nothing. moe didn't mean anything. he flies off the handle sometimes; but me and him are good friends. right, moe?}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{yeah sure. sometimes i gotta kick asses to make this place run right. freddie and i had a little argument and i had to straighten him out.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you straightened my brother out?}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time. players couldn't get a drink.}
<A>__{michael rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i have to go back to new york tomorrow. think of your price.}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{you son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that? i made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.}
<C>__{fredo}
<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{tom, you're the consigliere; you can talk to the don and advise him.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the don has semi retired. i'm running the family business now. so anything you have to say, say it to me.}
<A>__{nobody answers. michael nods to neri, who opens the door. moe exits angrily.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{freddie, you're my older brother. i love you. but don't ever take sides with anybody against the family again.}
