<L>__{interior burke's car day}
<A>__{matt is driving. burke is seated alongside him, talking without looking at him.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i'm going to pieces...}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{the picture was budgeted at 21 million and i spent 49 so they were a little mad at me to begin with. now it doesn't open even with an arby's roast beef tie in... i mean, we only averaged 300 dollars a theater... they're going to think i'm woody allen.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i don't think you have to worry about that.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{thanks. but this is private. what about the exit survey? did we do good with any group at all?}
<A>__{now we hear nan's voice on the speakerphone which burke has been addressing all along.}
<C>__{nan's voice}
<D>__{i can't hear you, but hi, matt that was funny.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{nan's voice}
<D>__{'i don't think you have to worry about that?'}
<A>__{she laughs delightedly. burke leans across matt's lap to get closer to the microphone.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{did we do well with any group at all?}
<C>__{nan's voice}
<D>__{eleven year old boys in the south.}
<A>__{he sits stupified.}
<C>__{nan's voice}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{burke? burke? matt, is he...}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i will see you later. goodbye.}
<C>__{nan's voice}
<D>__{but, hon...}
<A>__{he hits the "end" button. he slumps for a second, then:}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i'm all alone...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{at least there's that.}
