<A>__{paula emerges from behind the counter and stares at lucy, on the ground amidst glass and mayhem.}
<C>__{paula}
<D>__{say what you want. i'm keepin' the twenty.}
<L>__{exterior rural road day}
<A>__{two young, country boys stand by the side of the road. one, frank, tosses an egg from hand to hand while he watches the horizon. the other, billy, approaches, crawling through a barb wire fence dragging something behind him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hurry up. someone's comin'.}
<B>__{on horizon}
<A>__{sure enough, a hail of dust signals the approach of a vehicle a mile or so away. billy crawls into the ditch next to frank. we see what he's dragged from the field a scarecrow with a floppy hat and red bandana.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{stick it in the road. hurry up.}
<A>__{billy does so, propping the scarecrow into a sitting position with a forked stick. then he races back to the ditch and slides in next to frank to divide the eggs.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we got seven eggs. i get four to throw and you get three... since it was my idea.}
<A>__{billy nods.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{here they come. aim for windows and get ready to run.}
<A>__{the car crests the hill, followed by another, and another and a final one, all highway patrol, all with their lights on and}
<B>__{sirens wailing.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh shit!}
<A>__{the cars don't even slow at the sight of the scarecrow, blast ing right through it, sending hay, hat, limbs and all, flying. the scarecrow, or what's left of it, lands in a ditch next to the boys. in unison they breathe a sigh of relief, look at each other, drop the eggs and hightail it for home.}
