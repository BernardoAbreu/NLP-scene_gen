<A>__{in the far corner of a half empty dive bar. kate holds a microphone and dances as she sings a bad karaoke version of "song to be determined." what kate lacks in talent she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm. at a table near the stage is charlie hannah: kate's husband, late 20's, scruffy but handsome, also pretty damn drunk. he enthusiastically claps and points to kate, making up a cheering section along with owen hannah charlie's younger brother, early 20's who sings along with the small but energetic crowd. kate begins to ramble between verses and gleefully points to charlie and owen. for the moment, this drunk girl is the queen of karaoke.}

<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{he just got back from england because he went there for a girl! a preppy, bitchy girl. diane court...that was her name. he loved her so much that he went with her because she had a fellowship or something. he gave up being a kickboxer. a kickboxer!}

<P>__{(mile a minute fast)}
<D>__{...'cause i feel like i understand what it's like to be homeless, ya know? i mean, if you didn't know me, if we hadn't connected tonight, you might think: "there's some upper middle class, npr listening, self congratulatory, insulated, lazy liberal bitch. probably never had to worry about anything." but that's not true at all! i grew up poor, man. single mother. mcdonald's used to have one day a week where they sold 29 cent hamburgers, and another day where they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. my mom and me would go there and she'd get twenty burgers that was the limit, probably set up for folks just like us and then she'd put `em in the freezer and we'd microwave `em for dinner throughout the week.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{i was kinda overweight until high school, to be perfectly honest. eating used to be my thing. when i started drinking, though, i kinda stopped eating so much.}
