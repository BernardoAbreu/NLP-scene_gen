<L>__{exterior asteroid cave millennium falcon}
<A>__{it is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to see what is attacking the ship. leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{this ground sure feels strange. it doesn't feel like rock at all.}
<A>__{han kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline of the cave.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{there's an awful lot of moisture in here.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{i don't know. i have a bad feeling about this.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{chewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's cockpit. a five foot long shape can be seen moving across the top of the falcon. the leathery creature lets out a screech as han blasts it with a laser bolt.}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(to leia)}
<D>__{watch out!}
<A>__{the black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front of the princess. han bends down to investigate the dead creature.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{yeah, that's what i thought. mynock. chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. they're chewing on the power cables.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{mynocks?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{go on inside. we'll clean them off if there are any more.}
<A>__{just then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air. leia puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the ship. chewie shoos another mynock away with his blaster. several of the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit window of the falcon. inside, threepio shudders at their presence.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{ohhh! go away! go away! beastly little thing. shoo! shoo!}
<A>__{han looks around the strange, dripping cave.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{wait a minute...}
<A>__{he unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave. the cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle. chewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by leia and han. the large wings of the mynocks flap past them as they protect their faces and run up the platform.}
