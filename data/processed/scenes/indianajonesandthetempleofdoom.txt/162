<L>__{135. interior mine tunnels day}
<A>__{beneath the temple, down in the bowels of the mountain, the piti ful children dig at the earth with their fingers. a fat guard slouches down the tunnel, flogging malingerers with a aleather strap. short round sweats next to the others, clawing at the rocks, doomed to work with them now in their search for the last wo sankara stones. the leather strap suddenly flays short round's back and he barely manages not to scream out in pain. the fat guard passes short round and the other kids pull a large rock which suddenly comes loose out of the wall ! they fall back and see they've exposed a vein of molten lava! hearing their shouts, the fat guard returns yelling at their stupidity, he whips them and shoves them aside brutally. short round see the fat guard's eyes glowing fiercely in anger. suddenly the fissure shoots out steam and spews some molten lava over the guard's legs. the guard screams and falls to the ground, thrashing about, try ing to kick the searing lava off his smoking flesh. as the other kids cower, short round's humane instincts cause him to jump forward to help the guard who moments earlier was beating him short round tosses dirt on the guard's legs and grabs a gunny sack and starts rubbing the lava off. shorty notices something strange: the guard's eyes, which were glowing yellow before, are now dim ming and returning to normal. the moaning guard looks at shorty thankfully and then looks around as if waking from a nightmare }

<A>__{but the other guards push and beat the children back to work. short round is shoved against a wall and groans he reaches over and grabs a large rock, lifting it defiantly but rather than heaving it at the guard, short round smashes the rock down on the leg chains binding him to the other children. shorty beats at the chain with the rock, determined to escape.}
