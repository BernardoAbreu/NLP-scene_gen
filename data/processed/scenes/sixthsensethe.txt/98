<A>__{cole's p.o.v. the ropes and school banners dangling at the top of the stairs sways a little... but so do the three bodies}
<B>__{hanging by their necks from a wooden beam.}
<A>__{it's a truly horrific sight. a black man in britches and no shirt, face beaten to a pulp, hangs in the center. a white woman in a torn white frilly dress tears soaking her face, hangs to the right. a small mixed race child in half pants, hangs to their left. the family stares at cole. they follow cole with their tortured eyes as he exits the stairwell.}
