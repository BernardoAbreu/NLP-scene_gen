<L>__{interior obsession room browning's delusion (browning's p.o.v.)}
<A>__{as if looking through browning's eyes, we see his body stretched out before us on the mattress. the naked chest and arms are covered with raised lumps, red and painful looking. as his scratching arms attack these lumps, they break open, revealing vile black insects that have hatched beneath his skin. browning brushes these away while he scratches at the remaining lumps.}

<A>__{he proffers the razor. browning siezes it. malahide steps back quickly, a mixture of anticipation and apprehension on his face. browning slashes at his body and left arm with a short, sharp, slicing motions. in his mind, he is lancing the cysts that contain the tormenting insects. in reality, he is inflicting horrifying damage on himself. blood pours from the multitude of wounds, running over his body and down onto the mattress. suddenly, without any preliminaries, two painfully thin, flayed, mucus covered arms shoot out of the mattress, one on either side of the still busy browning. they wrap themselves tightly across his chest and crush him tightly to the mattress, as a head, similarly wasted, oozes out of the mattress to the side of browning's head. beneath his delusions, browning suddenly has an inkling of what is happening to him. his eyes widen and his mouth opens ready to emit a scream but the monster beneath him forces a hand over his mouth as it buries its face into the soft flesh of his neck. two legs now rise from the oozing slime that the bloodstains on the mattress have become. they too wrap themselves around browning so that he is held tight. finally, with titanic effort, he gathers enough momentum to roll completely free of the mattress and falls to the floor beside it. the thing on his back now is pulling free from the bed of bubbling, frothing slime that the mattress now is with a sliding, slurping sound. the monster's face is now deep in the flesh of his throat, and even as browning forces himself up first onto one knee and then, very unsteadily, onto his feet, we can see him wasting away his face losing its fullness and colour, his chest sinking in on itself. the creature, which is still wrapped around him and clinging tight is, unlike him, growing in stature by the second. muscles are inflating, arteries pumping more vigorously, and flesh itself filling out. its horrific thin ness when it first appeared effectively unsexed it but now, as its regeneration continues, the fullness of its hips, the roundness of its thighs, and the sacs of fat and muscle that bloom above its ribs confirm its female nature. if there was any doubt that this was julia, it is now disappearing. browning is now nearly a walking corpse and it is the strength of his will alone that allows him to take a few faltering steps with julia still enveloping him. with the desperate strength with which she clings to him and the way her legs are wrapped around his hips, it is like an obscenely perverse parody of sexual passion. malahide has been watching all this with an incredible mix of emotions playing across his face. still human enough to feel both fear and disgust at what is happening he is nevertheless awe struck and exhilarated. he has waited all his life for such an irrefutable demonstration of the power and the truth of the supernatural. similarly, the scientist in him is fascinated by the living anatomy lessons that julia's regeneration and browning rapid decay offer. with one last dying effort, the now almost husk like browning breaks julia's grip and makes a futile step forward as she falls from him. he totters towards the curtains. just as the audience think he will pull them down with him, revealing kyle, julia grabs his ankle and pulls. he falls back to the floor.}
