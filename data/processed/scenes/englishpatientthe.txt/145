<A>__{the open air cinema is just beginning its evening programme. pathe news begins and we date the event to april 1939. stories of imminent war jostle with images of merrie england. village greens, sporting victories, cruft's dog show. alone among the necking couples mostly soldiers with their egyptian girlfriends in an otherwise empty block, is katharine. she's waiting for almasy. a soldier comes over to katharine's row and settles a couple of seats away from her.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{beggin your pardon, miss, but have you got a lighter?}
<A>__{katharine lights his cigarette and returns to the screen. an item about fred astaire and ginger rogers and top hat. the stars do their stuff. the soldier moves a seat nearer.}

<D>__{fuck off.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{you heard me.}
<A>__{the soldier slinks off, muttering. katharine is wretched. she sits head down, not watching the screen, marooned in her despair about duplicity, sordid assignations. almasy arrives, slides in beside katharine, his shadow momentarily large across the screen.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{they watch the screen. katharine is weeping. almasy doesn't understand. he puts his arm around her.}
