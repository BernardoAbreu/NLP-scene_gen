<L>__{interior boathouse day}
<A>__{dim, deserted. filled with boat parts, tools, etc. castor hustles eve inside and locks the door behind him. lunt is there standing over a beaten archer. eve gasps.}

<C>__{castor}
<D>__{before i turn him in, i thought we'd pay him back for everything he's put us through...}
<A>__{castor starts kicking archer. over and over in the gut.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{come on, baby. join the fun }
<A>__{eve can't stand it. she charges castor but he immediately subdues her.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{too bad. part of me was hoping you didn't know.}
<A>__{he throws her down beside archer. she clings to him.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{did you really think it would be that easy, you dumb fucks?}
<P>__{(to eve)}
<D>__{sorry, baby. castor troy is about to murder you and our daughter... but i promise you won't die unavenged.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{this is between you and me. leave them out of this.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{it was between you and me. even your little boy that wasn't supposed to happen. but you couldn't let it go.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{no father could.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{appealing to my sense of 'family' won't work, jon. i thought you knew me better than that}
<A>__{archer plays for time looking for some edge. he sees a crate filled with block and tackle amid the shop's tools.}
