<L>__{int shieffelin hall night}
<A>__{more music and another card reads: "selections from the bard of mr. romulus fabian, tragedian in excelsis." the curtain rises and fabian steps out, a purple velvet cloak wrapped resplendently about him like a toga. in the audience, curly bill's mouth drops:}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{prettiest man i ever saw}
<A>__{fabian throws open his cloak, revealing his lithe form in doublet and tights. the whores in the gallery hoot and cheer. fabian bows.}
<C>__{stillwell}
<D>__{how come he ain't wearin' no pants?}
<C>__{barnes}
<P>__{(points to whores)}
<D>__{that's how come.}
<C>__{fabian}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, the st crispin's day speech from henry v. to set the scene, england is now at war with france. everything rests upon the battle about to begin. henry, the young king of england, addresses his men thusly: "my cousin westmorland? no, my fair cousin "}
<A>__{another gunshot and a bullet spangs into the column next to fabian with a shower of plaster. without missing a beat, fabian casually flicks a chunk off his shoulder and continues:}
<C>__{fabian}
<D>__{"if we are marked to die, we are enow to do our country loss; and if to live. the fewer me, the greater the share of honour..."}
<A>__{in the audience barnes holsters his smoke pistol reflectively.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{he's got nerve, i will say that. what do you think, billy?}
<A>__{starry eyed, breakenridge answers without thinking:}
<C>__{breakenridge}
<D>__{oh, he wonderful!}
<C>__{grounds}
<D>__{uh oh, looks like somebody's in love.}
<A>__{raw laughter from the others. breakenridge sinks in his seat.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{let him alone.}
<A>__{on stage fabian is in full cry, giving the local a slice of the ripest ham:}
<C>__{fabian}
<D>__{"we few, we happy few, we band of brothers; for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile. this day shall gentle his condition; and gentlemen in england now a bed shall think themselves accurs'd they were no here. and hold their manhood cheap whiles any speaks that fought with us upon saint crispin's day!"}
<A>__{wild applause and cheering. fabian bows with elaborate modesty.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{that's great! that's our kinda stuff!}
<A>__{the curtain falls. another card: "faust or the devil's bargain" and the orchestra whirls into "danse macabre" by saint saens, the rising curtain revealing a wild pained backdrop, all black and red, covered with weird, beardsley esque designs and images of death and damnation. a light comes up, revealing an ancient white bearded scholar sitting alone with his books. then a hooded satan dances across the stage, slender and lissome in paned black doublet and breeches and black hose, tempting the old man with images of wealth and youth in the form of a shimmering blonde ballerina. the old man succumbs, signing satan's contract. the audience watches in rapt attention, especially the cowboys:}
<C>__{stillwell}
<D>__{he's gonna some up short on that one.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{know what i'd do? i'd take the deal then crawfish and drill that ol' devil in the ass. how 'bout you, johnny? what would you do?}
<C>__{ringo}
<D>__{i already did it.}
<A>__{satan makes a flourish. a flash pad explosion transforms the old scholar into a young student. the ballerina flits by. the student offers her gold. they dance, swirling about the stage in a mad waltz with satan hovering behind them, mirroring their every move like a puppet master. finally, having gotten all his gold, the ballerina drifts away leaving the young student alone, lost in bitterness as he changes back into the old scholar sitting with his books. satan appears over him, exultant and triumphant, ready to collect the debt as the curtain falls with a final crashing chord. thunderous cheering and applause. the curtain rises again and the performers come out for bows, all except satan.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{very instructive}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{but who was the devil?}
<A>__{suddenly satan bounds out, removing the hood. it's josephine.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{it's that woman from the coach!}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{i will be damned...}
<A>__{josephine spots wyatt's box and smiles. doc raises an eyebrow:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you may indeed. if you get lucky.}
