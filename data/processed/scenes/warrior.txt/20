<L>__{interior brendan and tess' home bedroom night}
<A>__{the bedroom door opens and brendan creeps through the room and into the bathroom.}
<L>__{interior brendan and tess' home bathroom same}
<A>__{it's dark, except for the moonlight glowing through the window. an exhausted brendan takes off his shirt and begins washing his badly swollen face. then the door opens, and tess shuffles in.}
<C>__{tess}
<P>__{(sleepy)}
<D>__{hey babe. how was work?}
<A>__{brendan doesn't answer. tess slowly wakes up. as she does, she gets a look at his face.}
<C>__{tess }
<D>__{oh my god. what happened? you said it was going to be a slow night.}
<A>__{tess studies his face. brendan looks at her. reaches into his pocket and hands her $500 in cash.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i'm not bouncing at a club.}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{what do you mean you're not bouncing?}
<A>__{she looks at him. looks at the money. puts it together.}
<C>__{tess }
<D>__{you've been lying to me?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i went in to apply. they were only paying nine bucks an hour. then i saw a sign for this other thing.}
<A>__{tess can't believe what she's hearing.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{they're putting us out of the house in three months, we're running out of options }
<C>__{tess}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{then they'll put us out of the house in three months. i'd rather go back to the old apartment than see you in the back of an ambulance again.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i thought we agreed that we weren't going to raise our children in a family where their father gets beat up for a living.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{we're not giving up the house. this is our home. we're not going}
<C>__{backwards}
<A>__{tess reaches up and touches his battered face. calms herself down. embraces her husband.}

<D>__{we'll figure it out. but this is what we're not going back to.}
