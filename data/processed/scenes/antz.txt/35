<L>__{exterior false insectopia day}
<A>__{a picnicgrounds...a red and white picnic blanket, which to the ants looks like a vast, undulating pavilion, stretches before them. they gaze up at two obelisks: a salt and pepper shaker. behind that is a gigantic tupperware jar full of potato salad, and sandwiches stacked high. it all looks perfect, with the clean lines and monumental proportions of fascist architecture. in fact, it looks a little too perfect.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{we've found it! insectopia! look at all this food'}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{you were right...you were right!}
<P>__{(smiling happily)}
<D>__{z, it's beautiful!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{let's dig in!}
<A>__{z goes over to a gigantic sandwich, but booiiing! he's prevented from getting at it by the saran wrap covering it.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{there's there's some kind of force field!}
<A>__{bala joins him, laboring against the saran wrap. then both of them hear laughter from above.}
<C>__{male wasp }
<P>__{(lockjawed accent)}
<D>__{muffy, look, party crashers.}
<C>__{female wasp }
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{they're simply too much, chip!}
<A>__{bala and z look up to see two large, yellow wasps hovering in the air above them. the husband and wife wasps have lockjawed, william f. buckleyesque accents.}
<C>__{male wasp}
<P>__{(to z and bala)}
<D>__{you down there, haven't you ever been to a picnic?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{hunh? female wasphabla ingles?}
<P>__{(to male wasp)}
<D>__{well i really don't know who they are.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{we're ants!}
<A>__{the male wasp zooms in closer.}
<C>__{male wasp}
<D>__{poopsie, we know some ants, don't we?}
<P>__{(to z)}
<D>__{are you related to the fifth avenue ants?}
<C>__{female wasp}
<D>__{darling, do you have to talk to any insect from off the street?}
<C>__{male wasp}
<D>__{just being friendly, poopsie.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{hello? i'm not just "any insect". my mother is the queen.}
<P>__{(momentously)}
<D>__{i'm princess bala!}
<C>__{male wasp}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{they're eurotrash, dear.}
<A>__{we hear a loud rumbling noise the family is about to sit down for their picnic lunch. gigantic hands reach down and pull away the "force fields".}
<C>__{male wasp}
<D>__{lunch!}
<P>__{(to z)}
<D>__{a little piece of advice, sport bob and weave! bob and weave!}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{male wasp}
<D>__{well like my father used to say there's no such thing as a free meal!}
<A>__{the wasps dive in to the picnic, darting in for a bite, and then dashing away again...}
<C>__{the wasps}
<D>__{excuse me i will have some potato salad thank you! don't mind if}
<P>__{i do! after you! (etc.)}
<A>__{ but all is not well. we pull back to reveal that z and bala are standing in front of a giant sneaker logo, which is attached to a giant sneaker. which moves.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{i sort of imagined insectopia a little differently }
<A>__{just at that moment, we hear a whistling in the air and the female wasp is crushed by a huge swatter that sweeps out of the sky, sending the picnic blanket billowing up in an aftershock that throws bala and z to the ground.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{oh...my...god.}
<C>__{male wasp}
<P>__{(shaking her)}
<D>__{muffy! muffy! wake up!}
<A>__{but she doesn't move. the male wasp stares up at the sky.}
<C>__{male wasp}
<P>__{(heartbroken)}
<D>__{whyyyyyyyyyyyyy????}
<A>__{but z, also looking up, has no time to commiserate.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{bala, look out!!}
<A>__{they are only saved by the fact that they are so small .the holes of the swatter pass over them. the woman, realizing that the swatter won't work on ants, throws it to the side and tries stomping on them... before bala can get away, a sneaker falls on her with a thunderous boom that shakes the ground.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{mmmffllmmm...}
<A>__{the shoe rises, as the person wearing it steps away...and we see that bala is stuck in one of the ridges of the waffle soled sneaker, adhering to a big piece of bubblegum!}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{z! help me!!!}
<A>__{but bala is carried off on the sneaker in a huge, looping, ferris wheel like motion. boom. the sneaker on which bala is stuck falls again, as the woman tries to step on z, too }
<C>__{z}
<D>__{bala!}
<P>__{(mournfully)}
<D>__{i will never see her again...}
<A>__{ but he does, instantly, as the shoe rises again, showing bala stuck deeper in the bubblegum }
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{z!!! get me out of heeeeere!}
<A>__{ the woman has decided to walk away from the picnic to get the bubblegum off her shoe...z heart sinks as the shoe bala's stuck on lopes off into the distance...}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{these things always come in twos...}
<A>__{he sees a second shoe starting to rise }
<C>__{z}
<D>__{take me to your leader!}
<A>__{z runs towards the shoe as it rises... and at the last moment catches on to the snaky, swinging shoe lace.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{whoooooooaaaa!!!}
<A>__{the sneaker lifts off into the air, with z holding on for dear life to the lace, and getting further and further away from bala as he's drawn to a vertiginous height...the landscape can be seen rolling and pitching crazily in the background...}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{bala! come back here!}
<A>__{for a moment, the sneaker seems to pause in the air...then it descends again, in a stomach churning, roller coaster free fall as the sneaker on which bala is stuck rises up again...}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{z!!!!!!! i'm stuck!}
<A>__{ but z is trying to keep his lunch down as he descends. the sneaker hits the ground, and z can feel himself again...it's now or never.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(tarzan whoop)}
<D>__{aa ee ya ee yaaaaaaaah!!!!!!!}
<A>__{as the sneaker rises again, he swings off the lace, hurtling through the air and catching one of the laces of bala's sneaker...the momentum swings him up and under the sole...}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{z! you're here!}
<A>__{z gets smashed into the bubblegum next to bala. now he's stuck too.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(ruefully)}
<D>__{yeah. i'm here.}
<A>__{the sneaker descends again. z and bala hold hands and scream as they see the ground rise too meet them... thud! they're squished deeper into the bubblegum. the sneaker rises again...}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(emotional)}
<D>__{z...if we don't make it...i just want you to know....}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(touched)}
<D>__{yes? balathis is all your fault!!!}
<A>__{the sneaker rises, and seems ready to fall again...but instead it just hovers there. (the person wearing it is balancing on one leg and about to scrape off the bubblegum with a penny).}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{we're safe...}
<A>__{just then, the hand holding the penny looms up...the penny is, by ant standards, about sixty feet high. the huge image of abraham lincoln stares down at them.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{who the hell is that?!!!}
<A>__{the penny starts scrapes the bubblegum off the sneaker, bringing bala and z along with it. they're carried through the air as the penny gets thrown away...turning over and over in a lopsided orbit as bala and z scream... ...and land with a crash in total darkness.}
