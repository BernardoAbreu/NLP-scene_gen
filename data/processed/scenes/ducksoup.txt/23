<C>__{trentino}
<D>__{i am willing to apologize... i'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.}
<C>__{groucho}

<P>__{(coming to groucho)}
<D>__{oh, won't you reconsider...}
<C>__{groucho}
<P>__{(relenting)}
<D>__{well, maybe i am a little headstrong... but, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me.}
<P>__{(indicating trentino)}
<C>__{trentino}
<D>__{what i called you... why, what did i call you?}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{i don't remember.}

<D>__{was it swine?}
<C>__{groucho}
<P>__{(same attitude as above)}
<D>__{no... it was a seven letter word.}
<C>__{trentino}
<P>__{(thinking, then with a broad smile)}
<D>__{oh yes! upstart!}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{that's it...}
<A>__{takes gloves from trentino's breast pocket and socks him across the face... and puts them in his own breast pocket. trentino becomes apoplectic}
<C>__{trentino}
<P>__{(spluttering and stuttering)}
<D>__{why er mrs. teasdale this is an outrage! this man is impossible... my course is clear... this means war...}
<P>__{(turns to go and turns and yells to groucho)}
<D>__{you runt!}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{i still like upstart the best.}
<A>__{trentino exits in a rage. vera pretends that she is overcome by the scene}
<C>__{vera}
<P>__{(putting her hand to her brow)}
<D>__{oh, this is dreadful! if you'll excuse me i will go to my room...}
<A>__{she exits toward stairway}
<C>__{mrs. teasdale}
<P>__{(excited almost hysterical)}

<P>__{(to groucho)}
<D>__{are you sure you did the right thing?}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{of course. who ever heard of calling off a war after ordering all the ammunition?}
<A>__{by this tine vera has descended the stairs and exited from scene. groucho looks around the room furtively to make sure he is not being observed and takes a large envelope from his inside pocket.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{the plans of war are in this envelope. i want you to take care of them no one will ever suspect you.}
<A>__{he hands papers to her}
