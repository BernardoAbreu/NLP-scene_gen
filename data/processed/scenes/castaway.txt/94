<L>__{exterior beach night}
<A>__{chuck sleeps by the coconuts. the tide is coming in. chuck stirs, gets up, staggers over to a palm tree to relieve himself. he stares idly out at the moonlight on the waves. then not so idly. something's out there, something floating on the tide.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what the hell?}
<L>__{exterior beach moments later}
<A>__{chuck splashes into the gentle surf, reaches the dark object. it's a body. chuck turns it over. it's al, one of the pilots, his face gray and waterlogged and very dead.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{oh jesus.}
