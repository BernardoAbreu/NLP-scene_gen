<L>__{interior javal's geo (aerial shot) day}
<A>__{javal, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the glass and steel side of the tower looms closer. he screams.}
<L>__{exterior sunset vine tower day}
<A>__{the copter and the geo crash into the side of the tower, 12 floors up. glass blows out in all directions; the rotor shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like backwash. the geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner.}
<B>__{closer}
<A>__{from the series of jerking, slipping movements, it is clear the copter is not going to stay where it is for long. the geo's passenger side door pops open. javal, panting with fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the steering wheel to keep from falling out.}
<B>__{angle on vehicles below}
<A>__{in the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse... anything to get away from the area below the impact.}
<B>__{javal}
<A>__{reacts to another slip. the big saddlebags of money on the seat start to slide toward the open door. he gingerly reaches over to grab them... the copter shifts again... he loses his grip... and, clutching the saddlebags, he topples out of the car. we stay with him as he falls 12 stories, screaming... then landing on top of a parking meter. it rips though his chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet thud.}
