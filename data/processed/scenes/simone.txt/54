<L>__{exterior futuristic landscape "eternity forever" day}
<A>__{the finished scene with simone and hal plays on a screen.}
<L>__{interior screening room studio day}
<A>__{viktor watches the rough cut of "eternity forever" with elaine and daughter, lainey. as usual, they are mesmerized by the breath taking beautiful simone. the scene ends. the light go up.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{stunning, viktor. the hollywood foreign press is going to eat this up.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(turning to his daughter)}
<D>__{what did you think, lainey?}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{one thing bothered me.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i know, hal is as stiff as always.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{no, not that. i was just wondering in the bedroom scene in reel two why did simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?}
<A>__{viktor is shocked, busted. he covers it with a laugh.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(ashen faced)}
<D>__{i wondered if you'd spot that. you've got a good eye, lainey. i'm proud of you.}
<A>__{elaine looks at viktor for an explanation.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i got them to remove the reflection. the mirror's metaphor to show how her character's inwardly dead.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{that's genius, viktor. was that simone's idea?}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(sarcastic, annoyed at the suggestion)}
<D>__{who else? it's always simone's idea.}
<C>__{lainey}
<P>__{(not quite convinced)}
<D>__{so that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{precisely.}
