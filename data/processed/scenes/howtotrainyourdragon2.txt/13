<L>__{exterior arctic sky night (midnight sun)}
<A>__{(sequence 1325 searching) stoick and gobber search over the frigid waves that lap against the pack ice.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{boar headed! just like his mother! she could never stay put either.}
<A>__{gobber glances over at stoick, who's hunched over, brow furrowed and solemn.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{ah, he's just twenty. and a viking. i mean, could there be a worse combination? ha! when i think of how stubborn and senseless you were back in the day... well, not much has changed, actually.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{you know what he's like. he won't give up, gobber. and if hiccup finds drago, before we find him...}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{bah! nothing can hurt hiccup so long as that night fury's around. it's a night fury!}
<A>__{framed by a hole in the ice, a glistening object bobs on the surface below. stoick squints and circles back, leading skullcrusher in a dive toward it. stoick snags it out of the water. it's hiccup's helmet. gobber pulls alongside stoick, seeing his look of dread. stoick holds the helmet out for his dragon to smell.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{find him, skullcrusher. find him.}
<A>__{skullcrusher sniffs the helmet like a bloodhound, roars, and suddenly changes heading.}
