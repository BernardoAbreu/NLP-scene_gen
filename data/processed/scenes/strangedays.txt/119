<L>__{interior lenny's apartment}
<A>__{a little later. as lenny tosses stuff into a folding bag: clothes, a playback deck, a box of .45 hollow points. he grabs his grimy old second chance body armor from the lapd and stuffs it into his haliburton. when mace sees him do that, she knows things are freaky.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{where we going?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{anywhere.}
<P>__{(finger to his lips)}
<D>__{we'll talk about it in the car.}
<A>__{mace glances around... unnerved by the possibility of audio surveillance.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{hand me that box of tapes, will you?}
<A>__{he's pointing to a shoe box full of "faith" tapes. mace hands them over with obvious distaste. he throws them in the bag, starts to zip it... ... then sees his reflection in the bedroom mirror: something's the matter.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{this tie doesn't go with blue!}
<A>__{he yanks off the tie and grabs another.}
