<A>__{barely sober patrons sport cop hate stares, some on reflex, some because of sanderline johnson. doorman escort the bewildered, strong arm the belligerent. almost 6 am and the club is still half full. press on, scan the stage: a bebop trio toils over an erroll garner tune as a beautiful black girl sings in a satin soft lilt. this whispering falsetto that makes your hair stand on end. i stop and listen. get my only smile of the day from her. smile back because her voice reminds me to. hear beer bottles rattle behind and break. turn. squeeze that smile into a sneer, stare down this massive bartender.}

<A>__{he vanishes behind a stained curtain. feel those voodoo stares from behind...and i switch the scotch glass to my left hand as nonchalant as possible. bartender reappears, motions me back. i follow. backstage. i see a figure stretched prone, ice pack pressed to his face, rolled reefer between his lips.}
