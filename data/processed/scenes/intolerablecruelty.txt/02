<A>__{miles addresses a group of young attorneys at the firm.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{the problem is that everyone is willing to compromise. that's the problem with the institution of marriage it's based on compromise. even through its dissolution. one attorney will try to score some points, the opposition will try to impeach. the process will find an equilibrium point determined by the skill of the opposing lawyers, and then each party will walk away with their portion of the "goodies." some say, "life is compromise." but at massey myerson we believe life is struggle and the ultimate destruction of your opponent.}
<A>__{the receptionist pokes her head into the conference room.}

<A>__{miles massey's office you may have seen it in the issue before last of "world of interiors." there's a rothko on the wall, an elle bleu humidor on the desk, peonies in the vase, and the diploma is from yale.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{mr. rexroth.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{rex, please.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{miles massey. please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room for the duration of the campaign.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{now rex.}
<A>__{he leans back in the leather executive chair behind his desk, makes a steeple of his fingers, and dons his look of deepest concern.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{ tell me your troubles.}
<A>__{rex, nervous, laughs ruefully.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{jeez. where do i start?}
<A>__{miles gives an encouraging, rueful smile in return.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{...well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{that's her job. you have to respect that.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{when i first met marylin well, we were crazy about each other. not emotionally, of course. we just couldn't keep our hands off each other.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{mm.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{but then... but then...}
<A>__{quietly.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{time marches on. ardor cools.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{no. not exactly. it didn't exactly cool. marylin is a knock out. and very sexy but there's a lot of it out there.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{ah.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{you know what i mean when i say "it."}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{gotcha. no need to get anatomically correct with me, rex.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{seems like there's more of it than ever before }
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{well, with the expanding global population let me ask you this your wife. has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock out, sexy woman" you described?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{i don't know. i can assume...}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{not in court you can't. has she retained counsel?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{i'm not sure.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{video.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{mmm... and to cut to the chase, forensically speaking is there a pre nup?}
<A>__{rex hangs his head. miles sighs sympathetically.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{the fault, dear brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? what are, for you, the parameters of the possible?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{that's the problem. i can't afford to give her anything.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{nothing?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{i know that sounds rough but i'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini malls, and i'm mortgaged up to my ass. if this deal goes south, i'm ruined i will lose millions.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{so, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{well is that possible?}
<A>__{miles smiles at him.}
