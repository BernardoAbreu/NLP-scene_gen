<L>__{exterior car park baseball ground day (1968)}
<A>__{clough rushes out of the doors, straightening his cuffs, straightening his hair, buttoning his jacket. first out to greet the arriving team. he turns the corner to see the leeds coach a hundred yards down the street, the players getting off the coach and walking towards him..}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{what are they doing?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{they've run out of petrol.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{no, it's that superstition, isn't it? every away cup ties, revie makes them walk the last hundred yards.}
<A>__{taylor mutters under his breath, "soppy twat". clough cranes his neck. watches don revie, 40's. thick set. severe, forbidding, intimidating, in a huddle with his coaching staff, les cocker and syd owen. his henchmen. his assassins. his "goodfellas". his right and left hand. clough walks towards him. hand outstretched..}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{welcome to derby, don. pleasure to meet you. i'm brian clough.}
<A>__{but revie walks past without shaking hands, without talking, without even breaking stride.. ..and disappears into the stadium, deep in conversation with les cocker and syd owen. clough stares. hand still outstretched. he looks over at peter taylor, who can't help smiling, `forget it'. taylor and jimmy gordon walk off, but clough still stares at revie in disbelief.}
