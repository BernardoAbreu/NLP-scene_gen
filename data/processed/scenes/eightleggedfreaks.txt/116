<A>__{mike checks the phone. still dead. he types at his computer, entering the specification of the piece of exoskeleton. a digital representation of a spider grows on his monitor screen. showing mike exactly how big the spider would be after shedding this skin. mike is distracted by the loud music coming from ashley's room.}

<A>__{ashley stops ripping. she goes to the pile of animals, oblivious to the spider. the beast doesn't move. ashley grabs a pink teddy bear with a heart on its belly. she returns to bed and cuts the bear's heart out with scissors. the spitting spider sneaks up behind ashley. as it moves, so does ashley. she scoops up the torn photos and mutilated bear, dumping them in the trash. she turns around to find the giant spider on her bed. she freezes momentarily.}
