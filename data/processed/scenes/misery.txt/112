<D>__{annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and misery's spirit is still alive }

<A>__{and now she has lifted a chair it's heavy but she's very strong and she raises it and turns on paul, and it's high above her head, and paul realizes that this might be it, she might shatter him with it, crunch his skull and that's just what she seems she's about to do and then she swings it, not against him but against the wall, and it shatters and she's panting from the effort as she turns on him again, her voice surprisingly soft.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i thought you were good, paul, but you're not good, you're just another lying old dirty birdie and i don't think i better be around you for awhile.}
<P>__{(she crosses to the door, then stops)}
<D>__{and don't even think about anybody coming for you, not the doctors, not your agent, not your family because i never called them. nobody knows you're here. and you better hope nothing happens to me because if i die, you die.}
