<L>__{interior the knife room}
<A>__{frank is still impaled on the knives, but his anguished howl has become small whimpers of complaint (with, given his history with the cenobites, perhaps the tiniest note of pleasure in there, too) kirsty, larry and tiffany are now gathered together to one side of the room near the door that leads to the corridor. they should leave, but a kind of sick fascination keeps them watching frank. frank realises only leverage will pull him free of the knives and lifts his forearms up as much as they are free to. he turns his palms to face the knives and, with a growl of self encouragement, drives them deeply onto the knives so that he can begin to push the rest of his impaled body backwards. it takes several seconds and much pain for him to succeed, but succeed he does. he flops backwards into the room. several of the knives have stayed in him, rather than the wall his chest is decorated, or armed, with many blades. just as frank begins to stand, and just as larry and the girls snap out of it and are about to leave, the door from the conveyor belt room opens and julia walks into the room. kirsty and larry gasp. frank gives a slow smile.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{well, well. all my family together again. how very sweet.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(delighted flattered)}
<D>__{julia.}
<C>__{julia}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i knew you'd come.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{you knew?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yes. you're a girl who remembers her promises.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{oh, i do. i do.}
<A>__{frank grins, his grin taking in larry, kirsty and tiffany as well as julia. he extends an arm to julia.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{and i know how much i mean to you. come here.}
<A>__{julia does not move.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{come here. kiss me. and then...}
<A>__{he glances meaningfully at the others, perhaps stroking a blade of one of the knives in his chest.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{... we'll have a real family re union.}
<A>__{suddenly, surprisingly, larry laughs. he is genuinely amused.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{jesus christ, frank. i don't believe you. you don't know her at all do you? you still think you're in charge.}
<A>__{julia still has not moved.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{of course i am. she belongs to me.}
<A>__{julia begins to cross the room to him.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{for god's sake! he killed you!}
<A>__{julia doesn't pause. frank grins.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{she's forgiven me that. haven't you?}
<A>__{julia is now next to him.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{do you really need to ask?}
<A>__{frank laughs.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{show them.}
<A>__{julia glances at the knives. frank shrugs.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{just a small inconvenience, babe.}
<A>__{julia shifts position so she is standing behind him. she wraps her arms around him, one stroking his belly, the other across his shoulders. frank leans his head back and twists it slightly. they kiss. julia removes her arm from his stomach and slips it behind him. nothing happens for a second and then, suddenly, frank's whole body spasms. we almost think it may be with pleasure until he breaks from the kiss and we see the confused expression on his face and the blood bubbling at his mouth. there is a ripping, bursting sound and julia's hand emerges from his chest, covered in his blood. clutched in her hand is his ruptured, still pumping heart.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{jesus! out. out!}
<A>__{he shepherds the girls quickly through the door to the corridor. frank's body begins to twitch. julia holds it tightly.}
