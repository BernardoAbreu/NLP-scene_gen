<C>__{officer}
<D>__{... and then you climbed over a posted fence? just like that?}
<C>__{noah}
<D>__{i told you.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{isn't this supposed to be a national park? there shouldn't be fences. what are you guys doing around here anyway?}
<C>__{adrian }
<D>__{we're geologists...}
<A>__{jackson turns and sees adrian standing there.}
<C>__{adrian }
<D>__{i will handle this officer. thank you.}
<A>__{the officer reluctantly hands him jackson's license.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{so, where did the lake go?}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{that's what we're trying to find out. we think this whole area has become potentially unstable. i would advise you to take your kids and leave, mr...}
