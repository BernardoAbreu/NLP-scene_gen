<A>__{a glamorous shot of the almost finished xanadu, a magnificent fairy tale estate built on a mountain. (1920) then shots of its preparation. (1917) shots of truck after truck, train after train, flashing by with tremendous noise. shots of vast dredges, steamshovels. shot of ship standing offshore unloading its lighters. in quick succession, shots follow each other, some reconstructed, some in miniature, some real shots (maybe from the dam projects) of building, digging, pouring concrete, etc.}
