<A>__{selfridge is stares soberly as quaritch outlines the plan.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{i can do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous. we'll clear them out with gas first. it'll be humane. more or less.}
<A>__{selfridge sighs and rubs his face.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{hey, don't go limp on me now. this is exactly the incident we needed.}
<C>__{selfridge}
<D>__{alright, let's pull the trigger.}

<L>__{interior bio lab}
<A>__{max and the lab staff are glumly packing files and equipment, under the watchful eye of armed sec ops troopers. jake, grace, norm stare bleakly at each other.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{they bulldozed a sacred site on purpose, to trigger a response. they're fabricating this war to get what they want.}
<C>__{norm}
<D>__{i can't believe that.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{yup. that's how it's done. when people are sitting on shit you want, you make them your enemy. then you're justified in taking it.}
<A>__{trudy runs into the lab, breathless. she's wearing full flight gear and carrying her helmet.}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{sec ops is rolling the gunships. they're gonna hit hometree!}
