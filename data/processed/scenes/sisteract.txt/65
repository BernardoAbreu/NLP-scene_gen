<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{christy and mary robert are walking back to the convent. they are both in very good spirits.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{those people are wonderful! why don't we ever see them in church?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{good pointerior especially that dude you were with. i'd like to see him down front.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{mary clarence! you're so... different from the other sisters. sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{honey.}
<A>__{as the two women laugh together, they don't notice the car that begins to follow them, creeping slowly forward with its headlights out.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{i can't wait to tell reverend mother about all my experiences. i've learned so much.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything. i mean, nothing really happened. we just... took a walk.}
<A>__{the car's bright lights suddenly switch on, and the nuns turn, startled. the car hurtles toward them. they scream, and christy grabs mary robert and throws her out of the car's path; the two women land on a pile of garbage bags. struggling to her feet, christy sees the car go into reverse, and then pull forward again. she sees a glint of light reflect off a gun as the car's driver (mike the bartender) leans out the window.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(to mary robert)}
<D>__{run!}
<A>__{christy shoves mary robert towards an alley. as she does so, the gun goes off with a red flash. the shot misses the two women and shatters a plate glass window of the store behind them.}
