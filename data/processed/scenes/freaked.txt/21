<C>__{rick}
<D>__{hey! you're not supposed to have that stuff!}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{oh? well, i guess i'm not supposed to have these either!}
<A>__{he holds up a matching towel and washcloth embroidered with the "ramada inn" logo. rick, julie, and ernie gasp. he tosses the towels. as elijah gets worked up into a frenzy, the ambience in the room becomes more and more horrific: the sunlight is replaced by an eerie green glow, a thunderstorm rumbles to life, a raven perches on the windowsill, a rat scurries across the floor, one of those plastic "bony banks" reaches out and grabs a quarter...}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{i need only punch a few buttons on this magnificent device, and it gives me an easy to apply ointment that will mutate a perfect young body, bubble its skin, warp its bones and twist its guts into an unspeakably repulsive, stomach turning freak of my own design!}
<A>__{elijah's hair is now standing on end. he's foaming at the mouth. a bolt of lightning and thunderclap cap the monologue.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{wait a minute. does this mean we're not going to see a show?}
<C>__{elijah}
<P>__{(ignores her)}
<D>__{toad, fire up that machine, and let's turn these hapless asswipes into monstrosities! rick, julie, ernie}
<P>__{(together)}
<D>__{aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{now let's see. who wants to get freaked first?}
<C>__{ernie}
<P>__{(points at julie)}
<D>__{ladies first!}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{go screw yourself!}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{if i were you, i would!}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{hmmmm.}
<A>__{toad is adjusting some knobs on the machine. elijah steps past him to a jerry rigged computer console. he punches some keys and some rotating dna models appear on the monitor.}
<C>__{elijah}
<P>__{(mumbling to himself)}
<D>__{it's like yin and yang... ac dc... two birds with one stone... yeah, it's pretty darn good, really...}
<A>__{he presses "enter" and the computer beeps. he smiles.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{let 'er rip, toad!}
<A>__{toad yanks a pull start cord and the machine rumbles to life. elijah pulls the tasty freekz lever and fills a small dish with phosphorescent ointment. toad cuts open their clothes, exposing their sides, and pushes them close together.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{wait a second. you're really gonna smear that stuff on us and mutate our body parts!?}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{correct.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{well... then could you give me a really big rodney?}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{i'm a mad scientist pal, not a miracle worker.}
<A>__{elijah smears the ointment on their exposed sides. their skin begins to bubble and undulate.}
<D>__{julie ernie oh god!... no!... holy shit!}
<P>__{(etc)}
<A>__{a grapefruit sized lump pops up on ernie's side, then another on julie's side, and then the lumps do a little synchronized dance together. suddenly ernie's flesh balloons out and melds into julie's side. the mass of connected skin continues to bubble and mutate. odd shapes press up under}
