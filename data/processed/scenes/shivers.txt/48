<L>__{interior tudor's apartment night}
<A>__{nicholas tudor lies flat on his back in bed on top of the covers. the physical state of his face, ghastly and cadaverous, is in sharp contrast to his expression, which is ecstatic, beatific, madonna like. tudor's hands rest on his abdomen in a posture often associated with pregnant women. between his hands, in the area around the navel, three lumps shift beneath the skin, changing positions and pulsing rhythmically. as they move, tudor makes little delirious crooning sounds, a parody of a lullaby. in the living room, janine sits on the couch agitatedly flipping through her vogue, now wearing large, fashionable glasses with thick, tinted prescription lenses. she can't seem to get into doing anything until st. luc comes. she gets up and turns the tv on again, deliberately turning up the volume to an uncomfortable level.}
