<L>__{interior milton's apartment night}
<A>__{the penthouse. one enormous room. grand scale everything. otherworldly. staggering. of special, special interest: a huge bas relief dominates an entire wall. carved into the marble are human forms young, naked bodies swimming in a hypnotic chaos of clouds. milton is on the phone. two lines going. the dialogue is unimportant, we'll not understand it anyway he's going back and forth between korean and russian brokering some emergency deal. heath is at the bar, mixing drinks. barzoon has a cigar. kevin just standing there gaping at the space.}
