<T>__{cut back :}
<A>__{to the demons. suddenly a crashing sound catches jacob's attention as a kitchen pot flies by his head. he looks up to see jezzie knocking pots and pans off the kitchen counter and kicking them wildly across the room. the noise is terrible. the intensity of her rage is shocking. the pots crash into every surface, knocking all his books onto the floor. and then, suddenly, she stops. jezzie stoops down to the floor and picks up her sandwich, stuffs it back in its plastic baggie, and puts it back in her lunch box. she is about to leave when she stops and looks at jacob.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(continuing, her anger in check)}
<D>__{i made you a tuna fish sandwich. it's in the fridge. eat a carrot with it. the aspirin's on the bottom shelf. we're out of soap so, if for some reason you decide to wash yourself again, use the dishwashing stuff.}
<P>__{(she walks out of the}
<D>__{room and returns with}
<P>__{her coat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry i yelled, but you get on my nerves.}
<P>__{(she bends down and}
<D>__{makes eye contact with}
<P>__{jacob)}
<D>__{hello? listen, i gotta go.}
<A>__{jezzie sits on his lap, gives him a big kiss, and then, unexpectedly, raises two fingers, like horns, over her head. the gesture catches jacob's full attention.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{look, i'm horny. keep it in mind.}
<P>__{(she kisses his cheek)}
<D>__{love me a little?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(speaking with affection)}
<D>__{you are the most unbelievable woman i have ever met. one second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're florence nightingale. who are you? that's what i want to know. will the real jezzie pipkin please stand up.}
<A>__{suddenly the telephone rings. it startles them.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{oh shit. tell 'em i've left.}
<A>__{jezzie grabs her jacket and shoves her arm in it upside down. a pocketful of change falls on the floor. jacob smiles. jezzie curses as she struggles to pick it up and get the jacket on right. jacob gets the phone.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{jacob singer?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{speaking.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{paul gruneger!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{paul gruneger! well i will be goddamned!}
<A>__{jacob indicates it's for him. jezzie throws him a kiss goodbye and hurries out the door.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{paul! you son of a bitch, how the hell are you? i haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{a long time.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{jesus christ. how've you been? what's happening in your life?}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{nothin' much.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{me neither. nothing too exciting. so tell me, to what do i owe the honor?}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{i need to see you, jake.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{shit, paul. i'd love to see you. but i'm kind of laid up here. i've been sick.}
<C>__{paul }
