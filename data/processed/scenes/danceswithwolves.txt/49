<A>__{oil is pouring out of a jug and onto the great heap. dunbar empties the last of the oil and throws the empty jug onto the pile. he takes the match he's been holding between his teeth and flicks it to life with a fingernail. he flips it onto the heap. the fire catches immediately and dunbar has to back away a few steps as the flames send a column of thick, black smoke into the air. to dunbar's horror, the smoke billows bigger and bigger... climbing into the sky as a signal for anyone to see.}
