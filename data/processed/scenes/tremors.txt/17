<L>__{exterior val and earl's trailer day}
<A>__{val and earl's beat up mobile home is just down the street from pham van's store. val and earl, now in cleaner clothes, march out resolutely. val has a portable tv in one hand and a framed coors beer sign in the other. earl unhooks the clothes line and dumps it, clothes and all, into the back of their truck, on top of the rest of their belongings. they stare at each other for a moment. this is it. no going back. they leap into the truck. as they drive off, val leans out and yanks their wooden nameplate ("e. basset v. mckee") off the mailbox.}
