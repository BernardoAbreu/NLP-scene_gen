<L>__{interior debrief day johnny}
<A>__{sits across from a major who views a list on a monitor johnny can't see.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{i'm happy to tell you that you've been accepted for federal service.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{wow, that's great.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{looks like you're quite an athlete. boy, look at those reaction stats.}
<A>__{the major clucks his tongue as he highlights the last category on his list:}
<B>__{mobile infantery.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{my job is to dertermine what you're best suited for.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{i want to be a pilot, sir.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{sorry, son, no way. your school records say you don't have the math skills.}
<A>__{johnny swallows this. he knew it was coming. the major deletes "pilot" from the list, then several other items.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{that rules out the scientific and engineering applications, and i'm afraid we reserve non military options for candidates who are frankly less able bodied than you are, son...}
<A>__{he turns the monitor around and shows johnny the list. the only thing left is mobile infantery.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{it looks like the only thing you're good for is cannon fodder. i'm putting you down for the mobile infantery.}
