<L>__{exterior luxury box roof day}
<A>__{michael and julianne sit with their beers on the edge of the luxury box roof. the game, the stadium, spread out beneath them. yet they are alone in the world. she dangles her legs, and we can hear her kicking the glass below.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i just admire your maturity, that's all. i mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring. day after day, year after year...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{... see, that's what i thought at first. how can you like someone that perfect? no potential for long range livability.}
<A>__{drinking their beers. side by side. both stare only at the game.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{luckily. the closer i watched, the more the fault came into focus. each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{such as.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she's too genuine.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{hate that.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how can you trust someone you can never mistrust?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{what's next?}
<A>__{keep sipping. never look at each other.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no matter how many times i leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{endearingly absent minded.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{my very pointerior here's another one...}
<A>__{shakes his head. this one really gets him.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{every day. she makes the bed.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{quite the little eccentric.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{at first, i thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!}
<A>__{this is not the ammunition julianne was hoping for.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she admires. tommy lasorda.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{waiter! check, please!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she finds him "personable."}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?}
<A>__{she looks over now. and michael is looking back. smiling the most wonderful smile. her reaction shows that she thinks it's for her, until...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{then again. she has a few good traits.}
<A>__{hating herself for asking, but seeing no way out...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{first girl i ever knew. who lets me give her a bath.}
<A>__{the look in his eyes. she can hardly bear it.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{and when i hug her, even in public. i don't have to let go right away. she lets me hold her as long as i want.}
<A>__{he seems so deeply in love.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{nice kid, don't you think?}
<A>__{a beat. a slow nod. a quiet...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{looks like, from here.}
