<L>__{interior rutherford's auction house night}
<A>__{dressed in a not quite fitting but suave tuxedo, hawk enters the now well lit auction house auditorium (chairs all set out). bored workmen in coveralls lug equestrian items on to a podium from the familiar freight elevator.}
<C>__{eccentric bald auctioneer}
<D>__{...fan taas tic example of florentine marble... who will start at 160,000...160,000......180,000.}
<A>__{someone raises their paddle as hawk passes beneath the hanging horses and finds an aisle seat near the stage. hawk scans everyone in the room before coming to the one seated next to him, an enchantingly beautiful woman.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{all these years of attending auctions, i still get goosebumps. the paintings, the sculptures....the things that aren't really paintings or sculptures...}
<C>__{the woman}
<D>__{.... the pretentious vultures who don't even look up from their calculators to see what they're buying. now that gives me goosebumps. auctions are disgusting.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i couldn't agree more. savages.}
<A>__{the woman laughs at his gear switch then catches herself.}
<C>__{eccentric bald auctioneer}
<D>__{lot fifteen, an equestrian sconce attributed to the cellini school..}
<B>__{auction entrance}
<A>__{big stan, the hefty guard from the heist, enters the area wearing a blue ribbon.}
<B>__{auction area}
<A>__{big stan is walking in back of the seated bidders: an oblivious hawk in the foreground starts to scan varied bidder types, raising their paddles to babble out dollar figures; a gaudy rock star and his gloomy chic entourage, a king farouk type with a bored teenage american hooker, and a scary nordic princess in a monocle and a tiara. three standing assistants frantically man a table of phones set up down before the stage. one raises his arm.}
<C>__{eccentric bald auctioneer}
<D>__{sold! to the caller from newfoundland.}
<A>__{a stylish female assistant takes out an impressive replica of the "sforza" from the safe behind the podium and brings it to the auctioneer. the crowd a a hs... hawk laughs and shakes his head.}
<C>__{eccentric bald autioneer}
<D>__{and finally, lot number 17, thought to be lost in the war, and again last night, the da vinci "sforza," the jewel of the sale. fan taas tic...}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(re: auctioneer)}
<D>__{is looking like a constipated warthog a prerequisite to getting a job in the art world?}
<C>__{eccentric bald auctioneer}
<D>__{there have naturally been questions of its authenticity, so to verify we have doctor anna baragli of the vatican. doc?}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(rising, to hawk)}
<D>__{some of us warthogs are more constipated than others.}
<A>__{hawk uneasily laughs as anna makes her way up the stage and pulls out a large magnifying glass. a look of distress passes over her face. hawk closes his eyes in anticipation.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{oh, the shit is going to hit the fa }
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(suddenly serene)}
<D>__{fantastic. perfection. the vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.}
<C>__{eccentric bald auctioneer}
<D>__{we'll begin the bidding at 82.5 million dollars. to you, sir. eighty three, ninety your bid, madame ninety point five.....}
<A>__{hawk opens his eyes in confusion. he scans anna coming off the stage, gliding toward the phone table. hawk floats into the aisle, curling toward her as she picks up a phone and murmurs into it.}
<C>__{darwin mayflower}
<D>__{loo million clams, francesco!}
<A>__{the crowd orgasms as vanity fair cover boy, darwin mayflower works the aisle, playfully mussing up the appreciative, tiaraed princess's hair, giddily high fiving the rock star, and sloppily frenching the hooker.}
<C>__{eccentric bald auctioneer}
<D>__{100 million dollars to mr. darwin mayflower.}
<A>__{hawk turns to gaze at the enigmatically familiar figure. anna looks up from the phone to do the same. she swerves her attention to the back turned hawk. darwin moves to one of two reserved empty seats as his wife, minerva, makes her entrance par excellahnce. she is outrageously dressed with a mammoth tiffany watch that extends from her wrist down to, acting as a leash, her obnoxious little dog, bunny.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{francesco, 100 million and one.}
<A>__{darwin, to the crowd's delight, holds his struck heart.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{poor baby..... here, bunny.}
<C>__{eccentric bald auctioneer}
<D>__{fan taas tic, the bid is at 100 million and one dollars.}
<A>__{commencing a slow motion sequence, big stan comes out of the nearby office, zipping up his fly. he immedi ately scopes hawk in the space before the stage. the mayflowers lower themselves into their seats with devoured canary smiles.}
<C>__{eccentric bald auctioneer}
<D>__{go ing!}
<A>__{big stan pulls out his gun, untheatrically, as not to cause a scene. anna sees this and follows big stan's eyeline to hawk. hawk turns to re pursue but stops dead at the sight of the gloating big stan.}
<C>__{eccentric bald auctioneer}
<D>__{go ing!}
<A>__{big stan launches a gallop toward hawk, who spins and veers back round up the aisle. the mayflowers zero their sights on the activity.}
<C>__{eccentric bald auctioneer}
<D>__{gone!}
<A>__{the gavel comes down in super slow motion. anna's leg pokes out of the aisle, tripping the guard. hawk brakes at the end of the mayflower's row and smiles in relief, casually turning to darwin and minerva. the gavel continues to come down in super slow motion. both darwin and minerva mayflower suddenly duck down. smile vanishing, hawk spins toward the stage. the gavel hits. breaking out of slow motion into wide angle, the entire podium explodes sending debris, equestrian pieces, and eccentric bald pieces searing into the screaming, battered crowd. knocked off his feet, hawk gropes into a standing position. he sees the mayflowers make a smooth exit. he starts to give chase until he sees a battered anna rising from the ground. a hanging white tri star pegasus, cracks from the damaged ceiling and swooshes down towards anna. hawk bolts upon some auction chairs and makes a flying leap. he slams anna out of the pegasus's pulverizing path. they weary up off the ground and move down the aisle, calm in a storm of packed art patrons.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{my god, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{forget about it it was nothing anybody would have done the same thing it's an impulse...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, i meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress. a polite push, perhaps? a clear shout of "watch out, anna" would have done nicely...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{excuse me, milady. i would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but i left my cape at the cleaners.}
<A>__{anna touches hawk's lips and laughs.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{("hey, i was kidding")}
<D>__{thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. why was the guard chasing you?}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(serious answer? na a h?)}
<D>__{because danger, doc, is my middle...}
<A>__{before hawk can finish, a hanging horse out of nowhere hammers him into the ground and the viewer into darkness.}
