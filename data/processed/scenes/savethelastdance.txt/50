<A>__{sara really looks up. gives him an angelic, sluggish shrug.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i will be asleep.}
<A>__{he leaves. as soon as sara hears the front door close, she jumps up, strips down to bra and panties, races to the closet. one hand rips the rollers from her hair, the other rips through outfits. she's frantic and unsure about choosing the right one.}
