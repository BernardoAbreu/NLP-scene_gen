<L>__{interior study hall night}
<A>__{darnell sits at his table waiting for autumn. autumn storms in, obviously upset about something. she slaps a corrected test down in front of him.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{you seen this? you got a d on your math test.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{yeh, i kinda figured that. i had some trouble on this last part...}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{we went over that last week, darnell. what is this time we spend in here? just a joke to you? i don't even think you've been listening to me.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{i've been listening to you, baby...}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{don't call me baby. i thought you wanted to learn. but if all you wanta do is fake your way through, then get another tutor to waste time with.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{c'mon, autumn, we just had a good time, and now you're gettin' all nuts behind this. it's just one test.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{so far, it's the only test. i want you to study this whole chapter. by yourself, without me here. when i come back, we'll discuss it. be ready to do problems based on it.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{whatever you say, teach.}
<P>__{(big grin)}
<D>__{i don't wish to be cast in a pejorative light, so i'm dedicating myself to achieving on a level more commensurate with my abilities.}
<A>__{she shakes her head and walks away. darnell's grin fades. he looks at his test, a hint of tears in his eyes. he's embarrassed and deeply worried.}
