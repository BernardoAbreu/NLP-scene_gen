<A>__{this is deserted country on the way to town. when the land slopes steeply from the road down into a kind of wash, haven halts the wagon. he glances around. no sign of life. he takes a hammer and chisel out of the tool box beside the seat, crawls to the crate and prys it open. his cargo is gold. satisfied, he replaces the pried board, then pushes the crate over the side. it topples down the bank, vanishes in the brush at the bottom of the wash. with one more glance around, haven resumes his seat in the wagon, puts a match to his pipe, and sends the horses forward at a faster clip.}
