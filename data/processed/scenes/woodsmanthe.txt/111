<A>__{walter approaches his building. the white volvo sits parked across the street in front of the school. walter walks a couple of more steps when the door to the volvo opens. walter freezes. candy gets out of the car. as he turns, walter no longer sees candy but himself many years younger. walter watches, fear and emotion coursing through his face. young walter leans back in and pulls the front seat forward, and a young girl emerges. flash to the angel faced boy getting out of the car. candy pats him on the head. walter sees young walter pat the girl on the head. she runs off down the street. walter races towards candy. candy tucks his shirt in, puts the seat back, and is about to get in the car when walter calls out }
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{candy whirls around. walter smashes him in the face. candy reels backwards hitting the car. walter attacks candy full force. as he punches flashes of young walter appear, then candy, then young walter again. he pounds and pounds on candy then finally pulls away. candy sputters on the ground. walter, breathing hard, stares at candy. he looks at the blood on his hands, which shake uncontrollably. he slowly stands up and starts to back away. candy rolls over and groans as he tries to raise himself. walter turns, tucks his head down, and quickly walks away.}
