<L>__{exterior inside gates day}
<A>__{the crowd parts as everyone turns to look back at irene march. mrs. march, in her late 50s, is blind, her eyes clouded by cataracts. in disbelief...}
<C>__{mrs. march}
<D>__{did he say my name?}
<A>__{the sense of hope is palpable as the gates are swung back. two townies hurry mrs. march out to meet the postman. they're followed by a throng. as he sees she's blind...}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{oh, no...}
<A>__{too late now. they stop mrs. march in front of him. she stares off just to his left, a little afraid.}
<C>__{mrs. march}
<D>__{i'm irene march.}
<C>__{the postman}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{i have a letter for you.}
<A>__{he presses it into her hands, but she won't take it.}
<C>__{mrs. march}
<D>__{would you read it?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i'm sure it's personal.}
<C>__{mrs. march}
<D>__{please. someone has to.}
<A>__{the postman has little choice. as he opens the envelope...}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{we're delivering the old stock piles, but i will accept all new correspondence as well.}
<C>__{townie}
<D>__{just read it, will ya?}
<A>__{excited, the people move closer. someone holds up a torch and the postman starts.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{'dear irene. sorry i haven't written. everything's so crazy. the strange weather. the food shortages. that farmer nathan holn causing all that trouble. it's hard to understand. david's home from the army. the war was over before he even got there. thank god for that. he's still my baby no matter how big he gets. we're going to miss you for christmas, but maybe next year. all our love. donna.'}
<A>__{mrs. march reaches out a trembling hand to take the letter.}
<C>__{mrs. march}
<D>__{my sister in denver. fifteen years ago. thank you.}
<A>__{the populace erupts with excitement. mrs. march takes the postman's hand, clasps it tightly.}
<C>__{mrs. march}
<D>__{you're a godsend. a savior.}
<A>__{the postman pulls his hand back, rejects the title.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{no. i'm just... a postman.}
<A>__{an almost awesome silence. too much for the postman.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i've been on the road a while. i could use a little something to eat }
<C>__{mrs. march}
<D>__{oh, yes, absolutely... is there anything else?}
<A>__{the townspeople welcome him with cheers. the postman raises a silencing hand. as they quiet...}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{yes, there is! if there are dogs in this town, you have to leash them while i'm here!}
<A>__{only the postman laughs. no one else reacts. briscoe watches dubiously from the wall as the people surround the postman and sweep him through the gates and into town. one couple watches the postman closely as he makes his way into town. she is abby a sweet faced, pretty woman. her husband, michael, is a decent looking sort, tall and strong.}
