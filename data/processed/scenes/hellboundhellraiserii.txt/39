<A>__{the track continues. the room is dim, lit only by stray shafts of moonlight. on the floor in the centre of the room is the mattress. the track stops. a main light is clicked on and malahide moves into shot. malahide pours himself a scotch from the decanter that sits on the writing table and approaches the mattress. he is clearly very, excited. he walks around the mattress two or three times, never taking his eyes off it. he walks back to the writing table, throws his drink back, puts the glass down and leaves the room.}
