<L>__{interior jordan's b.o.q. coronado naval base night}
<A>__{two beds. matching lockers. a desk, a chair, a mirror. all overwhelmingly dull. jordan drops the robe off her shoulders to take inventory of her body. both sides of her neck are bruised from the phone pole run. her back and thighs are sand burned. mirror cuts abound. she's already a mess. jordan uncaps some cologne. it's a vestige of her old life she's not going to surrender. she sniffs. savors. dabs. looks back in the mirror... and breaks out laughing. it's like dropping a rose in a cesspool.}
