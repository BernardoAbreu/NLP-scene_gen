<A>__{gigi, pretty and approachable, sits in a booth at a hip mt. vernon date spot with conor, cute but holding onto his frat boy roots. they sip their near empty cocktails.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{so, janine told me you're a real estate agent.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{yeah. but don't worry not one of the cheesy ones who puts his headshot on bus benches and grocery carts.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{so just like on frisbees and notepads?}
<A>__{conor laughs. gigi smiles she's doing well.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{you got it.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{much classier.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{my thoughts exactly.}
<A>__{gigi sips her drink, and looks at conor.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{i wonder why janine never thought of introducing us before?}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{yeah, i don't know, i ummm }
<A>__{their waitress appears, cutting him off.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{you guys ready for another round?}
<A>__{conor looks to gigi.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{you want one more?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{only if you do. but i mean, if you have to get going i totally ...}
<A>__{gigi trails off. conor considers this for a long moment. we can see on gigi's face that she knows that the outcome of this date hangs in the balance. it's an eternity.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{umm. ok. sure. one more.}
<A>__{gigi breathes a sigh of relief.}
<C>__{conor }
<D>__{you had ketel and soda, right?}
<A>__{gigi nods and smiles, clearly flattered that conor remembered her order. she scoots a little closer to him.}
