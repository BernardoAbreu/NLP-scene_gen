<A>__{gus pulls out hazel's chair for her. a waiter brings them a bottle of champagne as they sit.}
<C>__{hostess}

<A>__{hazel and gus look at each other. is this a dream? the champagne is poured and gus raises his glass.}

<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{hazel raises hers.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{ok.}

<D>__{do you know what dom perignon said after he invented champagne?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{`come quickly,' he said. `i am tasting the stars!'}
<A>__{hazel and gus smile.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{welcome to oranjee. would you like a menu or will you have the chef's choice?}
<A>__{gus looks at hazel. she shrugs.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{the chef's choice sounds lovely.}
<P>__{(the waiter nods)}
<D>__{and can we get more of this?}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{we have bottled all the stars for you this evening, my young friends.}

<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{thank you for letting me hijack your wish.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{thank you for wearing that dress which is like whoa.}
<A>__{hazel shakes her head, trying not to smile but unable not to. the waiter brings two more glasses of champagne and a plate:}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{belgian white asparagus with a lavender infusion.}
<A>__{hazel takes a bite.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{gus takes a bite.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i mean...}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{that is just...}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{there are no words.}
<A>__{meanwhile, down on the water a boat passes, filled with merry, drinking locals. one of them raises a glass to them and says something in dutch.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(shouting back)}
<D>__{we don't speak dutch!}
<C>__{another local}
<D>__{she says, "the beautiful couple is beautiful!"}
<A>__{hazel and gus smile. this night could not be going any better so far. cut to: later. hazel and gus enjoying their second courses.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i want this dragon carrot risotto to become a person so i can take it to vegas and marry it.}
<A>__{hazel leans back in her chair, in need of a breather.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i like your suit.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{thanks. first time wearing it.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{that isn't the suit you wear to funerals?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{oh no. that one's not nearly this nice.}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{when i first found out i was sick i mean, they told me i had like an 85% chance to be cancer free. great odds, sure. but that meant a year of torture, the loss of my leg, and still a 15% chance it might fail.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so right before the surgery i asked my parents if i could buy a suit, like a really nice suit, just in case i didn't make it.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{it's your death suit.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{that's what it is.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i have one of those. bought it for my 15th birthday. don't think i'd wear it on a date, though.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{are we on a date?}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(cocks her head)}
<D>__{watch it.}
<A>__{gus winks. cut to: later. dessert on the table. as they euphorically eat:}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{god?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{angels?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{undecided.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{afterlife?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{no. well...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe i wouldn't go so far as to say no. i just... i'd like some evidence.}
<P>__{(gus nods)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{oh for sure. i mean, not like a heaven where you ride unicorns, play harps, and live in a mansion made of clouds but, yeah, i believe in something.}
<A>__{hazel is surprised.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{something becomes of us. it has to. otherwise what's the point?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{maybe there is no pointerior}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i refuse to accept that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i won't accept it.}
<A>__{hazel thinks about it. she appreciates his conviction but is still not sure she agrees. the hand they've been dealt too unfair. hazel looks out at the water as she says:}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i hope you're right.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i'm in love with you.}
<A>__{that gets her attention.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you heard me.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{augustus }
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i'm in love with you. and i know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and i know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and i am in love with you.}
<P>__{(shrugs, matter of fact)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{at which point, the waiter reappears.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{more stars?}
<A>__{hazel is still too speechless to respond, her eyes fixed on gus. eventually gus answers for them.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{just the check, please.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{your meal has been paid for by mr. van houten.}
<A>__{gus raises his eyebrows at hazel. this van houten guy is something else.}
