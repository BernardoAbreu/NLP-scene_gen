<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{the place is an italian restaurant with bar. the bottles sparkle. there are christmas greens and holly decorating the place. it has a warm, welcoming spirit, like martini himself, who is welcoming new arrivals. the booths and the checkered cloth covered tables are full. there is an air of festivity and friendliness, and more like a party than a public drinking place. george is seated at the bar he has had a great deal to drink, far more than he's accustomed to.}
