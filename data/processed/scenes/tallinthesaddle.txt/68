<A>__{med. close shot group at window. arly gives an involuntary exclamation of pleasure, which she instantly checks, then she moves abruptly out of shot, followed by juan. harolday continues to stare frowningly out of the window.}
<L>__{interior garvey's office day}

<L>__{exterior sun up saloon day}
<A>__{med. shot rocklin and crowd as they swirl around him offering congratulations. dave pushes his way through the crowd and thumps rocklin on the back in wild enthusiasm. at the same time, the sound of a horse cantering is heard, and jackson comes into shot.}
<C>__{jackson}
<P>__{(to rocklin)}
<D>__{hey, you! what's this you been up to?}
<C>__{rocklin}

<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{eh?}
<C>__{jackson}
<P>__{(blustering)}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{you're a liar!}
<A>__{he turns contemptuously and begins to move back towards the stage office completely ignoring jackson, who rides alongside blusteringly.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{now you lookee here, young feller. you go on talking that way and you'll find yourself in trouble.}
<A>__{the crowd which has been following now begins to razz him openly. he turns and glares, but without effect. he gives a final shout to rocklin.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{don't say you ain't been warned.}
<A>__{pulling his horse around, he sets off in a lope up the street.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{as miss martin comes along the street, determinedly, followed by clara, until she is face to face with rocklin outside the stage office where arly and juan are mounted ready to move off.}
<C>__{miss martin}

<D>__{i saw you. i saw you strike that poor man.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{yes, ma'am. as hard as i could.}

<D>__{let me go!}
<P>__{(to rocklin)}
<D>__{i knew the sort you were the moment i set eyes on you. you can't fool me! you're nothing but a common adventurer! come, clara!}
<A>__{she takes clara by the arm and sweeps past them towards the hotel. rocklin looks after them with a grim expression and then up at arly, who has been listening intently. she returns his look steadily for a second. then, with a mocking smile, she wheels the mare and canters out of shot, followed by juan. he looks after her for a second; then with the same grim look, enters harolday's office.}
