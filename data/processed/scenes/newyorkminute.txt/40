<L>__{interior hallway the plaza day}
<A>__{the girls climb out of the elevator and sneak to the end of the hall where parker stops and peers back around the corner.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{what are we doing? and why am i whispering?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{we're getting you a shower. blake greer pulled this at the sheraton after the prom.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{great. now we're emulating blake greer, voted most likely to commit a felony before having to shave.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{we're not going to steal anything. we're just going to sneak in, use a little soap and water and get out.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{oh, we're not going to steal anything. super. just a little 'breaking and entering.'}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{we're not going to break anything.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we are going to enter, however.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no. no. no.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{shhh... here comes somebody.}
<A>__{down the hall a door swings open and mr. and mrs. lo biancho, wealthy bostonians, exit their suite.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{reveals at the opposite end of the hallway, parker and drew aren't the only ones watching. a painter with one lazy eye, roger, pauses with his roller and carefully peeks around the corner.}
<C>__{mrs. lo biancho}
<D>__{it's the new york kennel club, emile, not the new york knickerbockers. please call the caterer and cancel the beer.}
<A>__{the elevator opens for them and they step in. parker runs like hell for the door of their suite... it's just about to close when she slides like pete rose into first, just getting a hand on it. she lies there on the floor, holding the door and whispers loudly to drew.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{hurry up!}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i didn't want to have to do this, but... look in the mirror behind you.}
<A>__{on drew bracing herself, she turns slowly.}
