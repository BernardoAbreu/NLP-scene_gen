<A>__{frodo falls to the ground. at that moment: the ground quivers, and a great rumbling noise rolls across the ground and echoes in the mountains. the cold, dull morgul valley is suddenly violent and fierce, as uprushing flame springs from mount doom. minas morgul answers: a flare of livid lightning, forks of blue flame, spring up from the tower into the sullen cloud.}
