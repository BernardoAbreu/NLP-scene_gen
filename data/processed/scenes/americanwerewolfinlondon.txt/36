<L>__{interior hospital nurses' station day}
<A>__{the corridor is busy with orderlies pushing gurneys about, doctors, visitors, and patients all performing appropriate background actions. behind the nurses' counter, alex is typing some forms and an older, obviously senior nurse is filling some paper cups with different sizes and colors of pills she is taking from the drug cabinet. she is mrs. hobbs, the chief nurse.}
<C>__{mrs. hobbs}
<D>__{miss price.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yes, mrs. hobbs.}
<C>__{mrs. hobbs}
<D>__{take these round now, will you please? the american boy in twenty one is only to have these after he's eaten. will you be sure of that?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{has he been refusing food?}
<C>__{mrs. hobbs}
<D>__{nothing quite as dramatic as that, miss price. he just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. he suffers from nightmares. i'd think he just needs a hand to hold.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yes, mrs. hobbs.}
<A>__{alex takes the cups handed to her and makes her way down the hallway, pausing a moment to straighten her appearance. she enters.}
