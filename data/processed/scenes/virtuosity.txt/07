<A>__{synthetic body parts lying strewn around one of the stations in letac the next day. it's a good bet this is the same technology attached to parker's elbows. there are also various shapes and sizes of robots, androids, and other synthetic forms. the most humanlooking ones are the least functional. the least humanlooking ones, the most functional. you follow a remotecontrolled, boxshaped robotic sentry moving swiftly through an obstacle course resembling a subway station. it is being operated by clyde reilly, 20s, a hardware genius who has spent too much time in windowless rooms. hidden from reilly's view, lindenmeyer, the software expert who created sid 6.7, stares jealously through a narrow gap in a partition. trying to contain his anger. and failing. especially as... wallace enters the station, carrying a bottle of dom perignon and two glasses. wallace hugs reilly, who does not return the gesture.}

<D>__{just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.}

<D>__{mr. wallace, i could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.}
<C>__{wallace}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{do they have to look so...robotic?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{at this stage, you either get form or function. you said she wanted function. i gave you function. what are you complaining about?}
<A>__{he remote controls the robotic sentry to chase wallace out of the station. lindenmeyer can no longer be seen through the gap in the partition. inside lindenmeyer's station lindenmeyer storms in angrily. sid 6.7 is visible on the virtual reality monitors around the simulator. he's giving himself a manicure.}

<C>__{sid 6.7}

<D>__{instead of just playing peeping tom with reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?}
