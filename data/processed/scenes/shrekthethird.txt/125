<A>__{shrek and fiona are diapering two of the babies in perfect unison. they continue diapering, fiona holds up the third baby and shrek holds up an unhappy, diapered puss. shrek grabs a gourd bottle off of a shelf. he tosses it to fiona.}

<A>__{fiona stands holding one baby over her shoulder. she catches the gourd thrown to her, twirls it around (a la tom cruise in cocktail), lifts up her leg where another baby is perched on her foot and puts the gourd in the baby's mouth. shrek is burping a baby over his shoulder. the baby burps. fiona has a baby over her shoulder and the baby burps. a dronkey sitting on a chair does a flame belch and an ogre baby crawling by farts which causes a flame thrower effect into the fireplace. shrek and fiona tuck all the babies into bed.}
