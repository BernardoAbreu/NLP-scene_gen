<A>__{the crowd engages in sod stomping. they drink champagne. they make a dance out of it. they laugh. shoes get stuck in the mud. it's ludicrous these people in their suits and fancy clothes, replacing divots and stepping over the horse shit. in a corner of the field, grazing horses stare, seemingly in disbelief. vivian is having a wonderful time. and then, as she moves towards the outside of the crowd she sees someone staring at her from over among some of the riders and grazing horses. david kross smiles at vivian. she hesitates... and then she crosses towards him.}
