<L>__{exterior rocky ledge night later}
<A>__{torch in one hand, wilson in the other, chuck walks across the rocky ledge. he passes the flume without even noticing. suddenly his shoe breaks! it's sandal made of woven yucca leaves. he bends down and fixes it, then heads on down the ledge.}
<L>__{exterior ledge moments later}
<A>__{chuck makes a casual leap, a leap he has made hundreds of times, but this time the sandal comes loose. it catches on a rock, and chuck falls! his hands are cut and bruised. he tries to get up, can't. chuck sits back and examines his foot. his fingers come back covered with blood. he reaches out to steady himself, and leaves a handprint of blood on the rock.}
