<L>__{interior luther's house dining area night}
<A>__{evening now. table set for one. a single candle. beside the candle is luther's sketch pad. now luther himself moves into view, carrying a tray. he puts it down. a gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley sprinkled neatly on top. an elegant green salad is on another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan cheese. an expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass. clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner. luther lights the single candle. we are now aware of a photograph nearby. the picture is old. a pretty little girl stands in the center, smiling. her mother stands alongside, smiling too. a man is with them, looking at them happily. it's luther. when he was young. luther studies the photo a moment. then he turns, looks out the window. pov shot sliver of moon is visible. lovely. peaceful.}
