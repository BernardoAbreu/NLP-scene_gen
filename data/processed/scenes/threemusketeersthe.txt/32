<A>__{a speeding carriage bears down on him. d'artagnan leaps from its path, stumbles. he looks up in time to see the passenger inside, and for a moment, time seems to stop. she is a noblewoman of remarkable beauty, her face framed by the carriage window. long blonde curly hair that cascades in ringlets to her shoulders, languid blue eyes, and skin as white as alabaster. she is known as milady de winter. she is to sex, what constance is to innocence. d'artagnan watches as if in a dream. the carriage, the beautiful woman inside it. paris wraps its arms around the young man's heart. suddenly: a second face enters the carriage window, replacing hers, jarring by contrast. it is the fierce visage of milady's indo chinese bodyguard, parker. the bodyguard glares, pulls at the carriage window curtains, taking milady, the dream, from view. hold on d'artagnan, bewitched, as the carriage rumbles off into the city.}
