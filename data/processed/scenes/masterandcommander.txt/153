<A>__{jack and nagel keep hacking at the tangle of ropes. knocking chips off the railing in their urgency to cut free the dragging mast. finally they succeed. the last of the ropes whips away, the broken mizzen disappears aft and the ship swings southward, away from the rocks. the wreckage is swept away by the next wave, leaving warley struggling, his last chance of getting back to the ship gone. then another wave breaks over him and he is gone. nagel is bereft. jack lowers his head.}
