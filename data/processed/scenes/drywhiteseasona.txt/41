<L>__{interior ben's study night}
<A>__{behind ben's house, are the servants' quarters attached to the garage. ben has adapted what would have been a maid's room into his study and the adjoining room into a do it yourself workshop. the study has photographs of ben's past as a provincial rugby player, of his family, school staff and trechikoff reproduction. on a cupboard are trophies of individual sports at university. he works off a plain desk on which is a handsome pipe rack with several pipes. his indulgence is a comfortable easy chair. ben's study, containing only the figure of ben. he's hunched over his desk, looking blankly at the newspaper. his shirt is unbuttoned, his jacket slung across his chair. he draws heavily on his pipe, wreathing his head with smoke in the beam of the single desk light. he sits in his chair: gordon's voice rises in his thoughts.}
<C>__{gordon }
<D>__{that day, mister ben, sir, when they whipped jonathan, you also said we can do nothing. god as my witness today: i must know what happened and where he lies. his body belongs to emily and me.}

<A>__{johan is entering, knocking on the half open door. he's in his pajamas and dressing gown, ready for bed. ben looks up at him. johan kisses his father who suddenly clasp his son hard, clinging to him for dear life. the boy throws his arms around his dad's neck.}
<C>__{johan}
<D>__{oh, papa!}
<A>__{susan appears at the door with a cup of coffee. she's had a bath her hair is wet and she's in her housecoat. ben and johan don't notice her approach. she watches sympathetically for a moment, then...}

<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm proud of you, ben... what you've done for that family. but darling, you shouldn't take these things to heart so much. what more can you do about it?}

<D>__{i will, in a minute. i will just put the thoughts of standar six away. they mustn't be lost to posterity.}
<A>__{she chuckles, satisfied, leaving him. he picks up his cup and drinks. he thinks again for a moment. then he removes a photocopied letter from an envelope and reads:}
<C>__{office voice }
<D>__{'... seeking the whereabouts of a certain jonathan ngubene, regret to inform you we have no record of anyone of that name...'}
