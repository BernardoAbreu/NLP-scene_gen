<A>__{we are close on a poster. it shows a perfect face, serenely beaming out; it could be silus or augustus, except this man is dressed in religious regalia, like a priest. the poster says "the brotherhood loves you. you are divine." we begin to crane off the poster which is revealed to be stuck on a lamp post. the street is seething, the slums of jamestown. a young boy, perhaps seven; spiked up hair, face covered in grime, grime from dragging himself up in this hellish place. he carries a bag filled with the detritus he's picked from the rubbish bins of the rich. he wears a distinctive red t shirt that is several sizes too big. he moves along the street, avoiding a disinterested passersby. as he passes an alley he hears something. an animal like growl. he stops. down the alley he can see two figures. one is a male. he is clutching another clothed figure; female.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{hey?! hey!}
<A>__{at that instant the man turns to the boy. there, half seen in the slick shadows, the most piercing eyes, a bloody mouth, with fangs, hissing. the creature drops the woman and scales the sheer wall of the alleyway; clutching various handholds, up four flights, then gone. the kid, frightened, now makes to run off but bangs into a passerby. the man grabs the kid roughly.}
<C>__{man in the street}
<D>__{where are you going in such a hurry my little ruffian? pilfering by the look of you?}
<A>__{the kid struggles and the man now sees the shape of the woman in the alleyway, slumped to the ground.}
<C>__{man in the street}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what's going on here? what'd you do to her?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{don't, i didn't do nothing. it was a brother. it was a brother did it.}
<A>__{the man moves forward, dragging the kid. and he sees the woman there, deathly white in the alley. dead eyes staring.}
<C>__{man in the street}
