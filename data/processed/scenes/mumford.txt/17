<A>__{althea brockett, a woman in her forties, sits on the couch reading a mail order catalogue for home furnishings. there are several other catalogues sticking out of her jammed, woven carry all. the door to mumford's inner office opens with some force. mumford stands looking back across his office at lionel, who is getting up from the couch in some confusion.}

<D>__{ you crazy? you can't do this!}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{sure i can, lionel.}

<D>__{i'm a criminal lawyer you think i like my clients? i can't stand most of them! but i don't kick them out...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{see that sign we retain the right to refuse service to anyone. i'm not going to charge you for this session, but i don't want to see you back here.}
<A>__{lionel looks around, but there is no such sign. he does spot althea watching the show from the couch.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{don't you at least have a back door i can use?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{come out this way. there's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, althea?}
<A>__{althea stands up, smiling. she thinks mumford is the bee's knees.}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{not at all. it takes guts, lionel.}
<A>__{lionel steams by them in a black mood.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{maybe some of us don't need this crap!}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{and it's the hubble telescope, not the himball telescope.}
<A>__{lionel bangs out the front door. mumford motions althea inside }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{jeez... what an asshole.}
