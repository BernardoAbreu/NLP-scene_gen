<L>__{exterior the jorgensen home breezeway}
<A>__{charlie waits assuredly as martin follows him outside. martin makes a wild run, swings. the blow is neatly guarded by charlie's left and countered with a crisp right that puts martin down. martin gets to his feet, more cautiously this time, and comes in at a crouch; he's fighting like an indian, not a white man. the men from the wedding party come out now at a run.}
<C>__{clayton}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{sergeant maccorry!}
<A>__{charlie turns slightly and in that instant martin springs and drives a straight right at his face almost as though there were a knife in the hand. maccorry stumbles back into clayton's arms.}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{is this in the line of duty, sergeant?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(regaining his balance)}
<D>__{no sir... pleasure.}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{in that case, give the boys room...}
<A>__{martin waits at a crouch as charlie comes in, feints his right and crosses his left. it is a hard blow but martin recovers and waits... charlie circles and starts to repeat. he feints his right but this time martin springs in, ducks and as the left shoots out he grabs the wrist and throws charlie over his head. what we are looking at, in effect, is a wrestler against a boxer.}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{fight fair, son... use your fists!}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(drily)}
<D>__{comanches don't use their fists, reverend... let 'em alone...}
<A>__{charlie is on his feet and warily starts circling now trying to imitate martin's crouch. suddenly martin feints a right swing and connects with a solid left reversing the order of business. charlie staggers and martin follows up with a wrestling hold, leaping behind charlie, locking both legs around him and driving his arms upward behind his back so that his face is in the dirt and so he could under other circumstances be neatly and expeditiously scalped. with the hands locked, martin then calmly draws a knife. he looks innocently into the aghast faces of the crowd.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{could scalp him... but i will just count coup!}
<A>__{with that he releases the paralyzed arms just long enough to grab a lock of charlie's hair and neatly snip it off. he stands then and laughs as charlie lamely gets to his feet easing the tortured arms. clayton goes to charlie's side. laurie moves to martin's side.}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{you all right, sergeant?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{dunno... seems so.}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...}
<A>__{charlie frowns and looks off at where laurie and martin are standing.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{ain't goin' to be any weddin' not till we get a few things cleared up 'round here...}
<A>__{he walks rather unsteadily away leaving a thunderstruck assembly, murmurous with surprise.}
