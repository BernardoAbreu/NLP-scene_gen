<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{renee sits on the couch. fred starts the vcr and joins her. as before, we first see it on the tv, then the videotape fills the frame. this tape shows the front of the house, as before, then shows the interior of fred and renee's house }
<B>__{at night.}
<A>__{the eerie droning sound goes throughout. the camera glides at a very high angle near the ceilings looking down as it travels along a hallway and turns into their bedroom, where we see fred and renee sleeping. the tape image then goes to snow. fred and renee stare at the snowy tv picture. after a few moments of silence, renee gets up and switches off the set. she is visibly shaken, trembling. she stares fearfully at fred who seems less disturbed.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{we've got to call the police.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{all right.}
