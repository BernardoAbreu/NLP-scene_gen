<L>__{exterior rooftop apartment building night}
<A>__{a party. rock music blares. drunk teens dance around burning barrels. groups lounge on ratty couches and turned over boxes skulling cans, making out, talking shit. a boy, 17, lights a molotov cocktail and hurls it off the roof. luba and raya join three guys. one of them pisses onto a cloth, stuffs it in a bottle, and tries to light it. it fizzles. everybody bursts out laughing.}
<C>__{raya }
<D>__{it's ammonia, not alcohol.}
<C>__{boy }
<P>__{(drunk) you're so smart. i love you!}
<A>__{he lunges in for a kiss, but she dodges him, laughing. luba gives him the finger, pulling raya toward the dancing into... teen mayhem: raya lets herself go. she gets lost in... a whirl of drunk and happy teens. it's tribal. they dance, silhouetted against the fire and the black sky, their backs to the run down soviet buildings... tonight, they don't want to think about what life holds in store. raya stops. dizzy. she looks at her watch, suddenly aware of the time. yelling over to luba...}
<C>__{raya }
<D>__{i have to get home. mama's gonna kill me.}
<C>__{luba }
<D>__{no, you're staying with me tonight. roman wants us there at 9 in the morning.}
<A>__{raya looks at luba. torn.}
<C>__{luba }
<D>__{it's just a few months working in a hotel. you want to work at copyshack like your mother? marry one of these assholes? there's nothing here!.. he said it was both of us or no go!}
<A>__{raya sighs, wanting to, but unable to agree. luba hesitates; she needs this so badly.}
<C>__{luba }
<D>__{fuck your mom!}
<A>__{but raya shakes her head, eyes apologetic. she pushes past luba who watches her disappear.}
