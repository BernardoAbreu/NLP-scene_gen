<A>__{with her face back in the seance staring wide mouthed in her trance. the sound of her heart pounds like the deepest dub track. total dislocation for her as she sees jimmy's old room, as it was but also sees it as it is now, and with her daughter, cinnabar, lying underneath the covers of the big, round bed. and lying close beside her, another figure beneath the covers. whoever is there snuggles closer to cinnabar. she responds as he presses against her, then wakes up.}

<D>__{cut it out.}
<A>__{but he doesn't. the movement beside her is undulant. strong, erotic, she almost gives into it. and still laughs as she says:}

<D>__{no, no patrick. stop.}
<A>__{the figure in the bed presses urgently against her, in a rocking movement which catches her up in it. she can't help it, she begins to respond to the urging behind her. pearl's eyes widen as the whole room shifts and becomes one fetid necropoliptic texture. the bed retains its shape but liquefies, seems to become one with the floor and the walls, all made of a kind of thick, bloody mud in which the trapped faces and distorted limbs of the dead twist and moan. meanwhile, on that strange bed, the figure behind cinnabar seems to wrap soft limbs around her, locking her in embrace.}

<D>__{cut it out.}
<A>__{but it doesn't cut out. it builds. strong. erotic. insistent. she almost gives in to it.}
<C>__{cinnabar }
<D>__{no, no patrick. stop.}
<A>__{but the movement is more insistent. and rougher. she starts to protest louder when she feels a hand, or something, steal across her mouth to muffle her objections. pearl tires to reach across her vision to grab her daughter and help her, but she can't.}
