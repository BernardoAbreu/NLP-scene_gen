<A>__{eddy and harry, the latter finding himself engaged in a violent scuffle with a man larger than himself and possessed of the prodigious strength of the psychotic. joan hurries around the car. harry, his cheek cut, is trying to force the knife out of eddy's hand. she looks toward harry's van, parked several yards behind eddy's car and immediately runs over to it.}

<C>__{joan }
<D>__{oh shit...}
<A>__{she runs back to the two men and hurls herself at them, causing all three of them to land in the brush on an incline at the side of road. a frantic free for all takes place on the precarious footing of the hillside, with joan alternately pulling at one and pushing at the other. the intensity and violence of their struggle is such that she is knocked further down the incline. harry, quickly glances down the hill to see if she is alright and is left open to severe blow by eddy, who breaks free and runs to his car. harry pursues him, catching him as he tries to get into the car. he pushes him against the door and they begin battering each other with a series of punches. the shepherd, wanting to join in the excitement, leaps about them, barking joyously. then finding eddy's sleeve, he takes it in his mouth and begins shaking it vigorously. joan, her hair fretted with twigs, climbs up over the edge of the hill. in the b.g. behind her, a helicopter approaches. she looks toward harry and eddy trading blows, then climbs up the rest of the way, and as she gets to her feet, she picks up a stone and throws it at them, yelling:}

<D>__{you bastards!!}
<A>__{the search beam of the copter spotlights joan. she is bent over, picking up sticks and stones and as if routing a deadly enemy, she begins hurling them, as well as a series of invectives, at the lights of the city below, her words barely audible over the sound of the rotors. the beam sweeps from her, to pick up harry and eddy and an amplified, god like voice comes from above:}

<P>__{(from above)}
<D>__{what are you people doing down there?}
<A>__{joan turns back to harry. he holds the now unconscious eddy by his shirt front and resuming his accusations, starts to move toward joan:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{are you crazy?! what are you doing, running around with a guy like this!!}
<A>__{she raises her arm, ready to hurl the last stone:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you maniacs!! you liars!! you shits!!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what are you yelling at me for?! this son of a bitch is probably the westside slasher!}
