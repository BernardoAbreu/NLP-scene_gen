<L>__{exterior tropical lagoon day}
<A>__{a 135 foot luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a tropical lagoon. the beach is a stunning crescent of white sand at the jungle fringe, utterly deserted.}
<C>__{isla sorna}
<D>__{87 miles southeast of nublar}
<A>__{two ship hands, dressed in white uniforms, have set up a picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully laying out luncheon service fine china, silver, crystal decanters with red and white wine. paul bowman, fortyish, sits in a chair off to the side, reading. mrs. bowman, painfully thin, with the perpetually surprised look of a woman who's had her eyes done more than once, supervises the settings of the table. she looks up and sees a little girl, cathy, seven or eight years old, wandering off down the beach.}
<C>__{mrs. bowman}
<D>__{cathy! don't wander off!}
<A>__{cathy keeps wandering.}
<C>__{mrs. bowman }
<D>__{cathy, come back! you can look for shells right here!}
<A>__{cathy gestures, pretending she can't hear.}
<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{(eyes still in his book)}
<D>__{leave her alone.}
<C>__{mrs. bowman}
<D>__{what about snakes?}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{there's no snakes on a beach. let her have fun, for once.}
<A>__{further down the beach, cathy keeps wandering away, muttering to herself as her parents' quarreling voices fade in the distance.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{please be quiet, please be quiet please be quiet...}
<A>__{rounding a curve in the beach, her parents disappear from view behind her. a rustling sound draws her attention, and she turns, toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the sand. a large bush, maybe twelve feet tall, is moving, its branches swaying and shaking. curious, cathy walks up to the bush, which abruptly stops moving. a small, lizard like animal, dark green with brown stripes along its back, steps out from the bush. only about a foot tall, it stands on its hind legs, balancing on its thick tail. it walks upright, bobbing its head like a chicken.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{well, hello there!}
<A>__{the animal (a compsognathus) just stares at her. cathy squats down on her haunches.}
<C>__{cathy }
<D>__{what are you? a little bird or something?}
<A>__{she opens her hand. she's got a handful of goldfish crackers.}
<C>__{cathy }
<D>__{are you hungry? you want a goldfish?}
<A>__{the compy bobs forward a few steps, cautiously.}
<C>__{cathy }
<D>__{come on. i won't hurt you.}
<A>__{the compy draws closer. cathy holds the cracker in the palm of her hand. the compy gets closer still and hops numbly up onto cathy's palm. her arm dips a bit under the weight, but it's not that heavy, and she holds it up easily. it bobs its head, scarfs up the goldfish, and eats it. enchanted, cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her hand, calling back over her shoulder.}
<C>__{cathy }
<D>__{mom! dad! you gotta come see this! i found something!}
<A>__{she turns back. thirty more compys have come out onto the sand. they're standing there, bobbing anxiously, staring at her from a few feet away. cathy's smile fades. she turns her head slowly to the right. twenty more compys have come in from that side, forming a semi circle, bobbing and chipping as they surround her.}
<C>__{cathy }
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{what do you guys want?}
<A>__{back on the beach, the table is set. mrs. bowman calls out.}
<C>__{mrs. bowman}
<D>__{cathy, sweetheart! lunch is ready!}
<A>__{from around the curve of the beach, a flock of birds bolts from the jungle trees as cathy's shrill screams suddenly pierce the air.}
<C>__{mrs. bowman}
<D>__{paul!}
<A>__{she takes off, running down the beach, mr. bowman leaps out of his chair and follows, and all available deck hands race off to help, kicking up geysers of sand behind them. down the beach, mrs. bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend in the beach. we don't see what she sees, but we hear the frenzied squeaking of the strange compys. mr. bowman and the hands race past her to help cathy as mrs. bowman lets loose a horrified, slack jawed scream, her mouth a perfect oval.}
