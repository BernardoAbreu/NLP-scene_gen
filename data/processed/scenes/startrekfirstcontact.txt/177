<A>__{two fifty foot long sheets of metal fall away from the ship on either side of the phoenix, revealing primitive warp nacelles tucked inside the craft. the warp nacelles then begin slowly extending themselves outward on either side the basic designs of the nacelles should be familiar to anyone who's ever seen a star trek starship. this is the beginning of a long standing architectural design element of our ships.}
