<L>__{interior mandela's cell day}
<A>__{pienaar peers into the cell. it is tiny. there is no bed, just a sisal mat on the concrete floor, with a couple of blankets. a chamber pot, a short bench, a tin cup and plate are the only other objects in the room. a couple of small lockers are screwed high to the wall. the barred window is opaque. it lets in light but does not allow the prisoner a view. when pienaar enters, we see how small the cell really is. he can reach out and touch the opposite walls at the same time. this is a bleak, horrible, dehumanizing place. pienaar is stunned by it. he turns, slowly, looking at mandela's world for over twenty years.}
