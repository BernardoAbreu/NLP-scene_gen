<A>__{ginger walks in and closes the door. she walks over to the dresser and takes off her earrings. then she reaches under her dress and unvelcros the modified 10mm. glock and its thigh holster, dropping it on the dresser. she then pulls off the hip, little designer dress she is wearing, revealing the fact that she is wearing a tiny transmitting receiver taped between her breasts. she stares at herself in the mirror for a moment, then slowly starts to untape the bug.}
<C>__{stanley }
<D>__{i have to hand it to you, ginger. you look good wearing anything. even a wire.}
<A>__{ginger grabs her glock and spins around, the holster dropping away with the touch of a button. she levels it on the dark corner of the room where stanley sits waiting, drinking a bottle of gabriel's expensive wine.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{you gonna kill me?}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{i'm thinking.}
