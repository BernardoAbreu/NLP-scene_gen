<D>__{he can stay in the little room.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but you know what? he's not going to live here. he's only gonna stay for a little while... and it's ok if you don't remember him, because you were only six the last time he was here... but it'll be nice if you got a chance to get to know each other a little bit. don't you think?}
