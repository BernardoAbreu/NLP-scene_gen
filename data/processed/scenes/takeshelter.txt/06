<A>__{samantha sits at a table running a long piece of sheer fabric through her sewing machine. she's making curtains. nat(37) sips a screwdriver from a clear plastic cup designed not to sweat. she's a woman with rough edges. cammie(24) cradles a brown haired baby on top of her pregnant, eight month belly. as nat speaks, she looks out a sliding glass door at her two kids, dj(7) and sue(5), playing with hannah.}
