<A>__{bean walks along the same corridor as before. turns off another light. then comes to the room where he saw the programmer. the computer, showing a van gogh portrait, is on and no one's there. bean, who hates wasted electricity, goes in to switch it off. we see the van gogh change to a pictorial representation of the storage room with an arrow pointing to where the van gogh is located. bean is clearly going to be replaced by this programme. or not ... bean searches for the plug, but it's under acres of desk so he simply pulls a cable out of the back the computer. the entire system clicks off. at which moment the programmer comes back in.}
<C>__{programmer}
<D>__{what's happening here?}
<C>__{bean}
<D>__{ahm...}
<A>__{with a slightly guilty smile he picks up the cable again looks with puzzlement at the five available places to plug it in and just takes a random guess. and a disastrous one. there is a ugly electrical fizzle. the screens come on white, then pop out completely.}
<C>__{bean}
<D>__{ah.... ahm....}
<A>__{bean realises that he has done something wrong and quickly shoves the cable into another circuit. the van gogh appears happily on the screen. bean and programmer both give out a sigh of relief. bean smiles and leaves quickly. but a second later the computer screen disintegrates and the van gogh slides down the screen like a water colour in the rain. the prog difficult to breathe.}
