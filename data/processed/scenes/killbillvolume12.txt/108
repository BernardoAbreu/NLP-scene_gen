<A>__{a brand new, enormous red pickup truck pulls into the parking lot and stops. the bride sits behind the wheel, looking at the bar and the bar's front door. using the rearview as a mirror, she grabs her long blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a rubberband. then places a baseball cap on the top of her noggin that reads, "stubb's bar b q." she steps out of the truck's cab. she's dressed like a little texas two stepper. levi's, cowboy boots, and a "harley davidson: loud and proud" tee shirt.}
