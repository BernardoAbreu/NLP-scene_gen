<L>__{interior miranda's cell night (present)}
<A>__{miranda wakes up with a start. the darkness renders the room almost void of any color. monochromatic. it takes her a moment to orient herself. her eyes wander across the unfamiliar room, feeling like she's being watched. we become aware of a ragged breathing sound. like somebody is standing over her bed. but we don't see anything. miranda gingerly crosses to the door and peeks through the glass partition into the empty corridor. she glances back at the room, stills seeing nothing and bangs on the door.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{can i get some assistance here? hello?!}
<A>__{she waits. bangs on the door again.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{irene?! anybody!?}
<A>__{a beat. and now finally we hear footsteps approaching. a light is switched on down the corridor. the footsteps get closer... and closer... miranda tries to appear composed. wipes sweat off her forehead. fixes her hair. the footsteps now stop right out side the door. a key goes into the lock and jiggles it. miranda waits for the door to open but nothing happens. confused, she steps up to the glass partition and peeks the second her face touches the glass, she is met by a pair of piercing eyes. the eerie teenage girl. miranda jumps back, screams. and when she looks up again, the image is gone. a beat. rational thought kicking in }
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(to self)}
<D>__{wake up, wake up...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're dreaming. it's not real. an anxiety dream, that's all. that's all. this is dream logic. if it was real, they would have heard you scream. there are twenty employees on the night shift. fact. at least twenty.}
<A>__{she props herself with her back against the wall. with a view of the whole cell. just in case. staring at the door.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i'm just dreaming.}
<A>__{and now, faintly at first, but growing louder footsteps can be heard approaching outside. just like before.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i'm dreaming, i'm dreaming, i'm dreaming, i'm dreaming.}
<A>__{like her life depends on that mantra. the footsteps get closer. and her voice begins to falter }
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(voice rising)}
<D>__{i'm dreaming, i'm dreaming }
<A>__{and now the footsteps pause outside her door like before and she holds her breath, horrified, when suddenly we are hit with the sudden glare of returning light. everything flashes white and then color returns }
<C>__{irene }
<D>__{rise and shine, ladies!}
