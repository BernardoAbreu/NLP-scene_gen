<L>__{exterior west hollywood bar night}
<A>__{gavin and melissa have martinis.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{i think my house is haunted.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{your house is really old.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{1926. ever since i got back, i feel like there's someone else there. and then last night, i thought i heard something. a woman singing.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{shit. like a ghost?}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{i guess. and then i saw something. i ran into someone.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{the woman?}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{it was a man. i think it was me.}
<A>__{a beat while melissa processes.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{your house is haunted by yourself?}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{gavin, are you alright?}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{no. no.}
<A>__{he takes a long beat, psyching himself up. what spills out is heartfelt but clearly rehearsed.}
<C>__{gavin }
<D>__{the network wants to replace you.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{and i'm letting them, because i really want the show on the air. i have all these characters inside my head, and they want to live. i'm the only way they can. this is the only way they can. i have five seasons mapped out, and though it sucks, either you go away, or the show goes. i had to make a decision, and that's the decision i made. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{by the end of it, we can hear the emotion in his voice. melissa takes a beat to process.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{so it's done. finished. decided.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{i understand. it's not your fault. you're morally incapable of doing the right thing.}
<A>__{gavin doesn't rise to the challenge.}
<C>__{melissa }
<D>__{don't get me wrong. i think you do feel bad for me. but that's all you feel for me. you still see me as the fat girl you call on friday night when a date falls through. let's go to a movie! let's go to fubar! and if you meet a hot piece of ass, don't worry about melissa, you can apologize tomorrow. or don't! same difference. it's not like we're actually friends.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{i don't want to do this on camera.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{no, because you can't control it. your little puppets are off their strings, running around. saying things you didn't write. reality terrifies you.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{reality.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{the reality is, you would not be here without me. i gave you your first few roles. and your career is a result of that.}
<A>__{with exaggerated relief...}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{god, thank you. thank you for finally playing that card. i always knew you were holding onto it, the "i invented melissa mccarthy card." congratulations, you win. the game is over.}
<A>__{she gets up to go, then decides she has one more thing to say:}
<C>__{melissa }
<D>__{don't you ever pity me again.}
<A>__{she leaves him sitting at the table.}
