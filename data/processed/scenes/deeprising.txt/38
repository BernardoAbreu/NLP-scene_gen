<A>__{as finnegan is watching the sea ahead, swathed in the shrieking clapton guitar solos, the hatch opens. hanover enters, followed by mason, who leaves the hatch door ajar. finnegan's eyes remain fixed on the sea. his ears on the clapton. hanover and mason hold onto any available rail as the boat slams over the waves.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{you remember the first time we met finnegan? i think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off sumatra for those two chinese...what did we use to call them?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{fok yu and fok yu two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{no, it just struck me as odd...i don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{you know what they say...the classics are eternal.}
<A>__{hanover looks at the topo imager. holding onto the rail to keep his balance as the boat slams over the choppy sea.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{so where are we?}
<A>__{finnegan points to a spot in the middle of the map.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{right here...middle of nowhere...}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{and where is our point of arrival?}
<A>__{finnegan points to another spot on the map.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{which question is that?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{the one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?}
<C>__{hanover}
<P>__{(to mason)}
<D>__{take note mr. mason...this is why you hire a professional...no whining. no excuses.}
<C>__{mason}
<P>__{(attitude)}
<D>__{i've heard a lot of stories about you mate...}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{all of them flattering i'm sure.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{they were...but they musta been talking about another finnegan... because the one i heard about was as rough as they came...the one i'm looking at is, well, about as current as the music.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{don't mind him finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{i don't mind him...but i do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{and who's gonna make me?}
<A>__{finnegan looks at mason...at the open hatchway just behind him...}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{the finnegan you heard about.}
<A>__{...and jams the steering sticks full speed ahead. the force of acceleration tumbles hanover into the console. mason tumbles out the open hatchway, down the stairs behind him. as he rises, hanover regards finnegan for a moment. a smile flits across his face.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{that's why we're sill around finnegan...you and me... nothing gets the feathers up. business is business. eh?}
<A>__{finnegan's hand finds the console. he hits a button. the first strains of led zepplin's whole lotta love comes roaring out of the speakers.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{and the classics are eternal.}
<A>__{finnegan cranks the sound to the max, pulls back on both steer sticks, and holds on, as the force of acceleration hammers him into the pylon.}
