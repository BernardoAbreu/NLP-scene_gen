<L>__{exterior shaolin temple early morn}
<A>__{establishing shot of mist laden courtyard. the sun is barely coming up, and only a few shafts of light are illuminating the darkness. a figure can be seen sitting cross legged in front of the door. it is drew, backpack at his side. the front door opens and a monk pokes his head out to look around, and he sees drew sitting there. his eyes widen in shock, then he quickly disappears inside. almost immediately, the door opens again, and the admissions monk is standing there, surprised and angry to see drew sitting there.}
<C>__{admissions monk}
<D>__{go home! you cannot stay here!}
<A>__{no response from drew. he just sits there, staring straight ahead.}
<C>__{admissions monk }
<D>__{do you hear me? go away!}
<A>__{drew doesn't move. san de, the sweeping monk, walks out of the open door, a monk behind him carrying a suitcase. he walks past drew, noticing him sitting there. he walks on. the admissions monk slams the door, angry.}
