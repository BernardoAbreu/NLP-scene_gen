<L>__{interior underground facility moments later}
<A>__{they descend a metal staircase and walk with great urgency down a narrow corridor. the hallway spills into a hauntingly huge metal room with a lone scientist standing in the middle. the scientist immediately begins leading them across the room.}
<C>__{general brat}
<D>__{when did it start?}
<C>__{scientist}
<D>__{at 05:00. we're seven minutes in.}
<L>__{interior observation lab continuous}
<A>__{the three men enter a large room divided by a one way mirror. on their side, numerous scientists, utilizing several archaic devices, are busy at work monitoring the subject on the other side of the mirror. the subject: private miller (22, naive and dutiful) sits at a small table with a microphone on it. miller raises his hand, revealing a smoldering jointerior he takes a long and awkward hit from the joint and bursts into a coughing fit. the scientists begin to scribble profusely as their devices blink manically. general brat and agent black suit exchange a concerned look. the general lights a cigarette as the scientist steps up to a small microphone in the corner.}
<C>__{scientist}
<P>__{(into microphone)}
<D>__{private miller, we are now going to ask you several questions. how do you feel?}
<A>__{his voice booms through large speakers on miller's side of the room. miller leans towards the microphone.}
<C>__{private miller}
<D>__{uh, i feel a little queer sir. but... it's good. good queer.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sir. good queer, sir.}
<A>__{the scientists scribble madly. one of them mumbles into general brat's ear.}
<C>__{private miller }
<D>__{but...uh...even though i feel queer, sir, i should mention that i'm also feeling quite gay...so, a little queer, but mostly gay.}
<C>__{scientist}
<D>__{private miller. when you think of your superiors, what emotions do you feel?}
<C>__{private miller}
<P>__{(holding out the joint)}
<D>__{this went out...sir.}
<C>__{scientist}
<D>__{we will send someone in. now answer the question.}
<A>__{a door opens beside private miller and an agent steps out wearing an intricate uniform that resembles an old fashioned diving suit, an air hose leading out the door that he came from. he slowly walks toward the private, who looks at him in shock.}
<D>__{scientist (cont'd) (o.s)}
<P>__{(through speakers)}
<D>__{private miller? answer the question.}
<C>__{private miller}
<D>__{oh...um...what was the question again?}
<A>__{the agent in the strange suit reaches the private and holds a lighter up to the jointerior}
<C>__{scientist }
<P>__{(through speakers)}
<D>__{what are your emotions towards your superiors?}
<A>__{miller pulls at the joint until it is lit again. the agent exits the room.}
<C>__{private miller}
<D>__{cough cough fucking shit.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, now that i think of it, it's strange that they are called my `superiors'. does that make me their `inferior'? i mean, that's pretty fucked up.}
<A>__{general brat scowls.}
<C>__{general brat}
<P>__{(curtly to the scientists)}
<D>__{i've seen enough. shut it down. bury the hatch, sell the land, and dispose of him. this never happened.}
<A>__{instantly, the scientists start packing up their equipment. staring at miller, general brat grabs a red phone and dials. two agents in the scuba like suits emerge from behind miller and start aggressively dragging him away.}
<C>__{private miller}
<P>__{(freaking out)}
<D>__{hey! what the...what are you guys doing! let go of me!}
<P>__{(desperately looking at the mirror)}
<D>__{sir!!! sir!!! help me!!!}
<C>__{general}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{this is general brat. we've reached a final conclusion on item 9.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{illegal.}
<A>__{he hangs up the phone.}
