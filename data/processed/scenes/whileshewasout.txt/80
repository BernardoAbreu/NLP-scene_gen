<L>__{exterior unfinished house 1 evening}
<A>__{she leans against a recently bricked wall, finally takes a breath. the smell of fresh cement and putty fills her nostrils. rain gathers and drips from a nearby ledge she peers around the side of the house.}
<L>__{exterior edge of woods construction site evening}
<A>__{beyond the rows of plots of land with their sold signs, she sees the boys still pacing and debating beside her ford, illuminated by the sweeping light rays of their flashlight. her eyes drift across the landscape of house foundations and structures to the distant neon lights of the shopping mall. when she looks back over for the boys, she sees that the flashlight and the boys are gone. she strains her eyes. guesses that must mean they're off looking for her in another direction. she clutches the tool box and silently creeps between the houses. if she could just track along the edge of the development she could maybe make it back to the shopping mall, to the twins. an owl hoots from the trees behind. she freezes, eyes sweeping the immediate area for danger. she waits a moment, silence, then makes her way once more between the edge of the development and the edge of the trees. she's trying desperately not to make a sound, praying to be invisible, eyes darting around, evaluating every shape and form. on one side the dense wood of trees, predominantly pine, with thick ancient trunks and tangled branches. on the other, plots and structures of homes to be. she keeps trudging on, skirting the edge of the trees, following the lights in the distance. she hears a loud thudding noise. stops. stops breathing.}
