<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{mrs darwin, it is nothing but chloride of mercury. i have prescribed it often in children as young as two.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{not to any of mine i hope. on the beagle i dropped some on a microscope slide and all my animacules died of it.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{well animacules are not persons. presumably they would die if you dose them with madeira wine.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{on madeira they thrived most excellently, as did captain fitzroy, while it lasted.}
<A>__{annie enjoys the joke and gives darwin a weak smile. the doctor regards her balefully}

<A>__{the doctor leaves the room. emma is in a terrible quandary}
