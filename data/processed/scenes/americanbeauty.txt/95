<A>__{on video: we're in an empty parking lot on a cold, gray day. something is floating across from us... it's an empty, wrinkled, white plastic bag. we follow it as the wind carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward, then letting it float gracefully down to the ground... jane and ricky sit on the bed, watching his wide screen tv.}

<D>__{it was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing. and there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it, right? and this bag was just... dancing with me. like a little kid begging me to play with it. for fifteen minutes. that's the day i realized that there was this entire life behind things, and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid. ever.}

<D>__{video's a poor excuse, i know. but it helps me remember... i need to remember...}

<D>__{sometimes there's so much beauty in the world i feel like i can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in.}
<A>__{after a moment, jane takes his hand. then she leans in and kisses him softly on the lips. his eyes scan hers, curious to see how she reacts to this...}

<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{oh my god. what time is it?}
