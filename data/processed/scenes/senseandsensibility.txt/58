<A>__{marianne walks very briskly, dragging an unwilling margaret behind her.}
<L>__{exterior downs near barton cottage day}
<A>__{it has started to rain. mists are gathering around the two figures walking against the wind.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{is there any felicity in the world superior to this?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i told you it would rain.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{look! there is some blue sky! let us chase it!}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i'm not supposed to run.}
<A>__{marianne runs off down the hill into the heart of the mist. margaret stumbles after her, grumbling. we follow marianne in her headlong descent and suddenly, dramatically, she trips and sprawls to the ground, letting out a sharp cry of pain.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{marianne!}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{help me!}
<A>__{she tries to get up, but the pain in her ankle is too great. she sinks back to the ground. margaret is very alarmed.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{margaret, run home and fetch help.}
<A>__{the mists have thickened. they can no longer see where they are. despite her rising fear, margaret squares her shoulders bravely and tries to sense the direction.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i think it is this way. i will run as fast as i can, marianne.}
<A>__{she dashes off. as she goes into the mist we hear the thunder of hooves. cu margaret's terrified expression. they seem to be coming from all around. she wheels and turns and then crash! through the mist breaks a huge white horse. astride sits an adonis in hunting gear. margaret squeals. the horse rears. its rider controls it and slides off. he rushes to marianne's side.}
<C>__{the stranger}
<D>__{are you hurt?}
<C>__{marianne}
<P>__{(transfixed)}
<D>__{only my ankle.}
<C>__{the stranger}
<D>__{may i have your permission to }
<A>__{he indicates her leg. decorous, perhaps faintly impish.}
<C>__{the stranger}
<D>__{ ascertain if there are any breaks?}
<A>__{marianne nods speechlessly. with great delicacy, he feels her ankle. margaret's eyes are out on chapel hooks. marianne almost swoons with embarrassment and excitement mixed.}
<C>__{the stranger}
<D>__{it is not broken. now, can you put your arm about my neck?}
<A>__{marianne does not need any encouragement. he lifts her effortlessly and calls to his horse: 'bedivere!' it trots obediently forward. the stranger smiles down at marianne.}
<C>__{the stranger}
<D>__{allow me to escort you home.}
