<L>__{exterior dussander's back porch night}
<A>__{dussander sits in his rocking chair. a small blanket drapes across his lap. he smokes a cigarette and holds a near empty glass. on the ground beside him, there is a small bowl.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{here kitty kitty. here kitty kitty.}
<A>__{out in the yard, the large cat emerges from the darkness and moves across the grass. it sees dussander and, more importantly, the bowl next to him. we see that the bowl is filled with milk.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{come, puss puss. that's right. i will wait.}
<A>__{dussander sits perfectly still. cautiously, the cat moves toward the porch.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{that's right, puss puss. you can smell it now, can't you?}
<A>__{the cat creeps to the edge of the steps. it takes them one at a time.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{that's right, kitty kitty. that's right.}
<A>__{after a moment the cat edges up to the bowl. its tail twitches nervously. finally, it begins to lick up the milk. dussander crunches the cigarette out in his empty glass. his movements are slow and patient. from under the blanket he pulls a pair of yellow rubber gloves. he begins to put them on. the cat jumps back for a moment. dussander freezes. he waits the cat out. soon the animal is back at the bowl. dussander continues with the gloves. he watches the cat's tail. as the animal gets comfortable, its tail flips under the rail of the rocking chair. dussander slams the chair back. the cat shrieks. dussander flips the blanket on top of the cat and wraps it into a tight, squirming, hissing bundle. he stands out of the chair.}
