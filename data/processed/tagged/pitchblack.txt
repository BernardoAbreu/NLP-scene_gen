<B>__{pitch black}
<D>__{screenplay by david twohy based on material by ken and jim wheat}
<A>__{revised first draft}

<A>__{note: the hard copy of this script contained scene numbers and some "" slugs. they have been removed for this}
<B>__{soft copy.}
<A>__{note also: the hard copy of this script was in the non preformat font "times new roman". this has been changed}
<B>__{to preformatted text for this soft copy.}
<A>__{though mentioned often in the script, the creatures in pitch black are seldom seen at length; rather, they are glimpsed, they are heard, they are felt. they are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears: a howling coyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life when stared at too long...the sway of your bed just before the earthquake hits. chimera of the night. the point is made so the reader appreciates that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do, but on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters. for pitch black is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage and lack of the same.}

<L>__{interior main cabin}
<A>__{a cryo locker blows open, spitting out... carolyn fry. she hits the deck of the main cabin: four crew lockers in a forward section, countless more in back. but the deck is canted at a sick angle and alarms scream everywhere: the world is dying around her. legs wobbly, shivering like a flu victim, fry stumbles to the next forward locker. it's riddled with holes. one dead crewie is seen through fractured plexi, body pocked and bloodied. but in the next cryo locked... the captain is struggling awake. fry's face floods with relief. slapping an intercom:}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{hear me? cap'n? some kinda compromise to the hull...holding for now, but...goddamn, i'm glad you're alive. gotta pull your e release...no, red handle, red handle. i will get the warm ups out while }
<A>__{phfut phfut phfut phfut: particles bore through the cabin , blasting open the captain's chest, shattering plexi, detonating instruments on the opposite wall and leaving contrails hissing in the air. fry lands on her ass, horrified. suddenly... another locker blows open. a body falls right on top of fry but this one's still alive. disoriented, frantic:}
<C>__{owens}
<D>__{why did i fall on you?}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{he's dead. cap'n's dead. christ, i was looking right at him when }
<C>__{owens}
<D>__{i mean, i mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. i mean, i mean, i mean, why did i fall at all ?}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{you hear me? captain's dead. owens too.}
<C>__{owens}
<D>__{oh, no. not owens, not.... wai', wai', wait. i'm owens . right?}
<A>__{they swap nightmare looks, momentarily unsure of their own identities.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{cryo sleep. swear to god, it sloughs brain cells.}
<L>__{interior nav bay main cabin}
<A>__{they stumble into nav bay. alarms continue. fry grabs warm up suits out of storage, pitches one to owens, checks her screens.}

<D>__{1550 millibars, dropping 20 mb per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. somethin' took a swipe at us.}
<C>__{owens}
<D>__{just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep space....}
<A>__{owens activates an exterior view: a planet rushes up at us. that's why they have gravity.}

<A>__{the ship plows through the upper atmosphere, antennae pylons already disintegrating.}

<C>__{owens }
<D>__{they trained you for this, right? fry? fry?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer.}
<L>__{interior flight deck day}
<A>__{fry harnesses in, starts running switches but fumbles a few times, making mental errors. finally she gets crash shutters open to reveal... cloud strata sweeping up past the windscreen like floor lights on a dropping elevator. we're shedding big altitude.}

<A>__{as jettison doors close around the ship.}
<L>__{interior flight deck day}
<A>__{as fry flips up a security latch and thumbs the switch below.}
<L>__{exterior ship planet's atmosphere day}
<A>__{multiple shots: explosive bolts rapid fire around the ship's skin, blowing away non essentials that hinder aerodynamics including big deep space drives. but this last separation puts the ship into a dangerous roll.}
<L>__{interior flight deck day}
<A>__{out the windscreen, cloud strata roll vertiginously. fry throws actuators...}
<L>__{exterior ship planet's atmosphere day}
<A>__{and airbrakes deploy. she manages to kill the roll. but the ship's still coming in nose high.}

<D>__{can't get my nose down...too much load back there....}
<C>__{owens}
<D>__{you mean that "load" of passengers?}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{so what, we should both go down too? out of sheer fucking nobility?}
<A>__{tortured silence. fry's thumb moves to the switch that will jettison the passenger cabin. jettison 50 people.}
<L>__{interior main cabin}
<A>__{selected shots of faces inside cryo lockers, among them johns. he's prime of life, badge on display, some kind of cop. shaken awake, he clears condensation to check the locker directly across from his, finding... riddick. small black goggles hide his eyes. a metal bit wedged in his mouth lends a perpetual grimace. a read out admonishes "lock out protocol in effect. absolutely no early release."}

<D>__{when captain went down, you stepped up whether you like it or not. now they train you for this, so }
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{and there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! that's how they train you! on a fucking simulator!}
<A>__{owens unbuckles from his chair.}
<C>__{owens}
<D>__{don't touch that switch!}
<A>__{overcome by guilt, fry retracts her thumb of mass destruction. but a huge jolt puts the thumb right back.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{i'm not dying for them. she pushes it . but this time...}
<L>__{exterior ship planet's atmosphere day}
<A>__{no bolts fire. nothing separates from the ship that screams down through the clouds.}
<L>__{interior nav bay main cabin}
<A>__{now we see why: owens reopened the jettison doors locally and blocked them open.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{owens!}
<C>__{owens}
<D>__{70 seconds! you still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!}
<L>__{interior flight deck day}
<A>__{seething anger and guilt, fry pops more airbrakes, shedding more speed, more heat. the ship does level but it's still being pounded hellishly. she tries to get a stable view out... the windscreen. we're breaking through cloud bottoms. there's just a glimpse of landscape before...}
<L>__{exterior ship planet's atmosphere day}
<A>__{an airbrake fails . it shears off and pinwheels into...}
<L>__{interior flight deck day}
<A>__{the windscreen. it cracks into a thousand spiderwebs but impossibly it holds. for now.}
<C>__{owens }
<D>__{what the shit was that?}
<A>__{sunlight flares from every fractured edge: it's like looking into burning diamonds, and fry can only get an impression of the outside world. now she has to rely on... a ground mapping display. 120 meters altitude. and dropping.}

<A>__{ohns. realizing he's in some kind of shit storm, he claws at safety restraints.}

<L>__{interior nav bay main cabin}
<A>__{impact. chairs rip from their moorings. strapped into one, owens slams into the ceiling.}
<L>__{interior main cabin day}
<A>__{impact. johns blows out of his locker and wishes to god he would've stayed inside, because just beside him... the hull is cracking open . nightmare shot: a huge section of the cabin tears free... skitters and crashes along the planetfloor behind us...and disintegrates out of sight. 40 cryo lockers vanished with it.}
<L>__{40 lives. interior flight deck day}
<A>__{hammered by wind, fry opens her eyes experimentally. fry's pov: a vortex of motion, of speed, of blurring debris. but the ship is burrowing in. burrowing under . fry pivots her chair 180 degrees a nanosecond before... dirt avalanches into the cockpit . it buries camera.}
<T>__{blackout:}
<L>__{interior main cabin crash ship day}
<A>__{choking yellow dust. ghostly silhouettes are coughing, moaning, calling out to other survivors in english and, surreally, in arabic. soon we find... johns. ears running blood. stumbling his way to... riddick's cryo locker. empty. johns reaches for his holster. gone, torn right off his belt. no prisoner and no weapon spooky combination. nearby he sees... the light of a cutting torch. someone's using it to open a jammed cryo locker. the plexi is torched away to reveal... audrey, 12 years old. unscathed.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{somethin' went wrong, huh?}
<A>__{johns searches for his pistol. behind him, two chained feet lower into frame and then attack, swinging over johns' head... getting the chain on his neck...twisting hard, using the chain as a choke collar. johns flicks open a baton, swings it up at... riddick. still in body chains and mouth bit. clinging to a ceiling support. riding out the baton blows. seconds from blacking out, johns strains forward...forward...and finally breaks riddick's grip on the support. he keeps hold of the chained feet so that... riddick slams headfirst into the deck. johns lays the baton on his neck.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{one chance and you blew it, riddick. never cease to disappoint me.}
<L>__{interior flight deck crash ship day}
<A>__{darkness. a light beam sweeps the dusty air of the cockpit. it's packed with dirt, no signs of life. about to search elsewhere, johns turns back at...}

<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{hey, who?}
<C>__{fry }
<D>__{hey, me. over here.}
<A>__{his light finds a headrest sticking up from the dirt. johns crawls closer, checks the other side of the headrest and finds her. fry. buried to the gills.}

<D>__{amazing. i'm johns.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{carolyn fry. i'd shake hands, but...}
<A>__{he manages a smile and starts digging her out. almost dreading to ask:}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{are there any others, johns?}
<L>__{interior main cabin crash ship day}
<A>__{johns helps fry through the carnage. she's stunned by it all but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be. realizing she's in nav bay, fry starts digging like a search dog to uncover... owens. still strapped to his chair. metal rod piercing his chest close to the heart. dead. fry reaches out to touch him.}
<C>__{owens}
<D>__{out, out, out, get it outta me!}
<A>__{she recoils hard. he's still alive . the other survivors bungle over. ten seconds of pure chaos:}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{pull it out of him...no, it's too close to the heart...you gotta do it, just do it fast....}
<A>__{fry grabs the rod.}
<C>__{owens}
<D>__{don't touch it! don't touch that switch!}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{you'll kill him, i'm tellin' you, shit, just leave it alone...delirious...doncha you got some drugs for this poor man....}

<C>__{fry}
<D>__{awright, awright, someone...there's anestaphine in the med lock, that end of the cabin...next to....}
<A>__{but there is no more "that end." in exquisite pain, owens screams on. reaction shots of johns, audrey. seldom are human beings witness to such raw suffering.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{get away. everybody.}
<A>__{the others leave except for audrey, staying behind to watch in morbid fascination. johns doubles back and collars her. leaving, they pass... riddick, cuffed to a bulkhead. his eyes, still hidden by goggles, track johns and audrey toward daylight.}
<L>__{exterior crash ship day}
<A>__{the survivors straggle outside. camera surveys new faces: zeke and shazza. male female team of bushwhackers, partners in life. shazza has a tough sexiness. zeke's face shows aboriginal blood. (30s.) paris. overfed, overgroomed. a puff pastry of a man. (40s or}
<L>__{50s.)}
<A>__{four male "chrislams": the pillar steady imam (50ish), and three pilgrims, young and excitable (late teens). (note: the chrislams represent a union between christianity and islam. they have the iconography of christians yet the physical look of arab muslims.) wide shot: all around them is stark and unforgiving terrain. the valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side, spiked with earthen spires. scorching down on everything are two suns one red, one yellow.}

<C>__{imam}
<D>__{please...which way to new mecca? we must know the direction in order to pray.}
<A>__{north? south? east? west? nobody knows. johns snaps open a compass, finds the needle swaying rudderlessly. the screaming inside the ship finally ends.}

<D>__{so what the bloody hell happened, anyways?}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{somethin' knocked us off lane. maybe a rogue comet. maybe we'll never know.}

(note: the predator pov is a crude image that gives impression without detail. we're "seeing" what the predator hears with echo location. think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its subject in 3 d space.) oblivious, the others kick out the new escape hatch. audrey, fry, and johns worm through. imam and pilgrim #2 hang back.

<C>__{audrey}
<P>__{(big eyed)}
<D>__{you came for us....}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{yeah, yeah we're all fuckin' amazed. anyone not ready for this?}
<L>__{exterior the gauntlet night}
<A>__{protected by the meager light of two glow worm bottles, the four remaining survivors head out.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{tighter, tighter....}
<L>__{exterior muddy rise the gauntlet night}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{stop.}
<A>__{they pile up awkwardly. fry listens hard. only rainfall.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{i don't hear }
<A>__{he covers her mouth. riddick's pov: water has pooled at the base of the muddy rise. a predator drinks there.}
<C>__{riddick}
<P>__{(on his breath)}
<D>__{doesn't see us...wait for it to leave....}
<A>__{riddick's pov: another predator lands to drink. then another. their backs are to us, but the pool is turning into a major gathering place. soon they all can hear clicking above the rain. their nightmare is far from over.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{get behind me.}
<A>__{riddick's pov: of a half dozen predators shifting places at the pool. a slim gap appears.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{when i go, we go. full throttle.}
<A>__{close on their hands, gripping each other.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{ready...ready....}
<A>__{riddick's pov: the gap between predators widens into a passage. a gauntlet within a gauntlet. riddick runs . linked like paper dolls, the others follow blindly. riddick's pov: of a predator turning to "stare" over its shoulder. predator's pov: of riddick bearing down fast. the survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs, crashing through, scattering water and predators alike, managing to reach... the muddy rise. audrey loses her grip on the others... and starts back sliding . she cries out, turning the head of... riddick. he catches audrey as her legs hit the pool. he muscles her back up the rise and heaves her over the top, sending her slip sliding down the other side.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{you know the way!}
<A>__{not waiting for him, fry and imam disappear over the rise. riddick's pov: of the predators. regrouping. crawling up the rise at us.}
<L>__{exterior night}
<A>__{fry, imam, and audrey run hard, glow worm lights bouncing wildly. riddick's pov: chasing them. predator's pov: chasing riddick .}
<L>__{exterior settlement night}
<A>__{fry, imam, and audrey reach the settlement. they spill around a corner and see... the light of the skiff.}
<L>__{exterior settlement night}
<A>__{riddick's pov: ahead of us, we see fry, imam, and audrey vanishing around the corner. breathing like a racehorse, we follow in their steps, storming around the same corner. suddenly a predator is right there , right in our face. predator's pov: of riddick skidding to a stop. he snaps a look up. riddick's pov: of another predator perched gargoyle like on the building. it speed clicks at us. predator's pov: of riddick slowly pulling two shivs. bracing himself. ready to blade it out.}
<L>__{exterior skiff night}
<A>__{imam and audrey stagger aboard. safe in the light of the headbeams, fry turns back, panting, waiting. waiting.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{captain....}
<A>__{he wants her to board the skiff. fry gives it another beat, eyes sweeping the dark rain. and just when we think it's over for riddick terrible screams are heard from both man and predator: there's a helluva fight going on out there. close out there. fry snatches the glow worms off imam's neck... and plunges into the darkness, homing in on the sounds until... a blade flashes in her face . she ducks and spots... riddick. bloody, muddy, he's down on his knees, still trying to fight off the shadow beasts that swirl and slash all around him. around them both .}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{it's me, it's me, it's me!}
<A>__{she gets the light around his neck. now we see his face clearly and see a very human expression there: fear. fry grabs his armpits and tries to pull him up.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{c'mon, riddick said i'd die for them , not you.}
<A>__{he gets his feet under him. gripping each other, they start moving, turning like dancers in a macabre waltz, hoping the predators can't fix on riddick's blood.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{just 10 steps...keep turning, keep turning...that's right...others're already 'board, waitin' for us right now...five steps...c'mon, almost there, riddick... almost there...we're almost }
<A>__{something jolts them. all clicking stops.}
<L>__{extreme closeups: searching each other's eyes. someone just got}
<A>__{slashed from behind, slashed bad. but who?}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{not for me....}
<A>__{in an eyeblink she's gone, ripped from his arms. there was no scream. no cry. no final words. just... blackness.}
<L>__{exterior planet's orbit night}
<A>__{out of the blackness, a spot of fire races toward us. it resolves into the skiff, fabric wings burning off as it hits escape velocity.}
<L>__{interior skiff night}
<A>__{close on a bloody hand. it toggles through nav charts, plots a rendezvous with "sol track 17b" shipping lane. in the cockpit, riddick finds audrey beside him. she stares hypnotically at the stars ahead.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{probably okay to talk to me now.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{not sure where to go. i was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{where you goin'?}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{not sure. i was just runnin' away when this whole thing....}
<A>__{interior smiles. stars sweep the windscreen as the skiff makes a course correction. one very bright star comes into view.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{might interest you....}
<A>__{imam moves forward. seeing, his face lifts.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{new mecca....}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{think a soul could get lost there? with all those pilgrim types?}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{it's more a place where souls are found, mr. riddick.}
