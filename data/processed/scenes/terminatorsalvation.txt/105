<L>__{exterior skynet street day}
<A>__{rounding a corner on a straight, narrow street, marcus sees all the robots and small vehicles clearing into small niches built into the walls on either side, as if clearing a path for him. it takes him a moment to realize it's not him they're responding to a rumble builds... a convoy of gigantic skynet trucks a half dozen modified semis now driven by cpus bear down on marcus at extremely high speed. they carry construction supplies: massive steel beams, concrete pipes, etc. and there's barely inches of clearance on either side. these things aren't slowing down. there's nowhere for marcus to duck out of the way. he has no choice but to run, as fast as he can, the lead vehicle gaining on him rapidly. marcus throws himself to the concrete in the middle of the street, pressing his body flat as the lead truck passes over him, the wheels missing him by inches. but he has only a moment's respite. the next truck has a lower undercarriage, a steel crossmember catches his back and drags marcus beneath the vehicle, ripping off chunks of flesh. marcus cries out, crawls ahead and clings to a forward portion of the undercarriage, keeping himself just above the pavement. his left leg, twisted and damaged, still drags on the asphalt, throwing up sparks. overhead angle on the truck camera pulls back straight above the moving vehicle, amidst the convoy speeding down this sunken artery. camera keeps moving upward to reveal an aerial view of skynet's city. seen from above, the rectilinear structures, criss crossing power lines and speeding vehicles strongly resemble a pulsing circuit board.}
