<A>__{joan and harry come down the steps of the inn. the sun has gone down and the lights of the city have come on. under the following they cross the driveway to a low fence railing off an oriental garden.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you know, it's very sad. i look at my sister and all her marriages and affairs, not to mention the mess my own life is in, and i think it's very sad and very bleak that men and women can't manage to be friends.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it depends on the man and woman you're talking about.}
<A>__{they arrive at the fence and as she speaks she rests one of her hands on the railings:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{what a tragedy that sex is often such a barrier to friendship between men and women.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{there i disagree with you.}
<A>__{he places his hand over hers. she remains silent a moment, restraining her response to the gesture. then:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you know dante and beatrice never slept together.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{is that right?}
<P>__{(catching himself)}
<D>__{oh yeah, i forgot that part.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{well, anyway... i shouldn't have had so much wine... because i prefer to go a little slow here.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{we can go as slow as you want... why not?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{so...}
<P>__{(looking at him)}
