<L>__{exterior andy's house driveway inside joan's car night}
<A>__{joan sits in dejected silence, refusing to look at harry:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{look, you know, you live a life, honey, you make some mistakes. you get married for maybe mutual benefits, or business considerations weighing on you at the time, and because you don't think the right person is ever going to come along.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i would never have knowingly become involved with a married man.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i know that, that's why i was trying to come out and tell you...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{please, i don't want to discuss it anymore.}
<P>__{(after a brief silence)}
<D>__{i bet you never read dante, either.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{now there you're 75 percent wrong.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i mean, i can't believe it, that you'd lie to me about this...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{okay, i lied. didn't you ever tell a lie? if not let me kiss your high heel.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i'm going in the house.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{wait. can i call you tomorrow, just to see how you're feeling? or how things are going?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i have a dress rehearsal tomorrow and a concert on friday. that's all i care about right now.}
<A>__{she reaches to the door handle, then very emotionally:}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{and i don't want to see you anymore.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{don't say that, please. i'm asking you to just give me the chance to clear up all these things in my life, because...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no. i didn't extricate myself from the infidelities of one man, just to fall into the arms of the prince of prevaricators...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, i may be all kinds of a son of a bitch, and the prince of whatever, but that doesn't mean i wouldn't, when it comes down to it, stand up and take the bullet for you.}
<A>__{she finally looks over at him, her eyes brimming with tears:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{that's not what i observed, harry.}
<A>__{she opens the door and gets out. harry's pov as joan crosses the driveway to the house, moves up the steps to the front door and disappears inside.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{he remains seated for a moment, glancing briefly down at the watch on his wrist. then his eyes raise expectantly as: pov duke comes out the door and lopes across the driveway toward the mercedes.}
