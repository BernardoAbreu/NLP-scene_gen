<L>__{interior metro night.}
<A>__{it is now crowded with people, black, white, punky and street chic, a lot of leather all the women are heavily made up. someone is singing from the tiny stage and rows of cheap colored bulbs are flashing around it. from the way fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never been here at night. he seems most out of place in his cheap suit, making his way through the crowd to the bar.}
<B>__{at the bar.}
<A>__{fergus looks through the odd crowd, but can't find dil. col, the barman, sees him and smiles.}
<C>__{col}
<D>__{so can we consider you a regular, sir?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{is that good or bad?}
<C>__{col}
<D>__{well, you get to say, the usual, col. things like that.}
<A>__{col pushes a colored cocktail with one of those japanese umbrellas toward him.}
<C>__{col}
<D>__{so let's call this the usual.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{fergus reaches for his wallet to pay, but col interrupts.}
<C>__{col}
<D>__{no, no. it's on me.}
<A>__{fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by implication, whatever are the norms of the place. he lifts the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the way.}
<C>__{col}
<D>__{take it out, if you want.}
<A>__{fergus takes out the umbrella. he holds it in one hand and drinks with the other.}
<C>__{col}
<D>__{you came to see her, didn't you?}
<A>__{fergus shrugs. he takes out a cigarette. a guy in leather to his left smiles at him.}
<C>__{col}
<D>__{something i should tell you. she's }
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{she's what?}
<A>__{the barman looks up toward the stage.}
<C>__{col}
<D>__{she's on.}
<B>__{the jukebox.}
<A>__{a hand presses a button. the needle selects a disk. a song by dave berry, "the crying game."}
<B>__{at the bar.}
<A>__{fergus looks up. close up of dil's hand, as music begins, making movements to the music. we see dil, standing on a stage, swaying slightly. she seems a little drunk. she mimes to the song. she mouths the words so perfectly and the voice on the song is so feminine that there is no way of knowing who is doing the singing. she does all sorts of strange movements, as if she is drawing moonbeams with her hands. the crowd seems to know this act. they cheer, whether out of approval or derision we can't be sure. fergus watching. dil singing, noticing him. she comes to the end of the song. the crowd cheers. fergus, watching her make her way through the crowded bar, toward him.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{he's still looking, col.}
<C>__{col}
<D>__{persistent.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{good thing in a man.}

<D>__{maybe he wants something.}
<C>__{col}
<D>__{i would expect he does.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{ask him.}
<C>__{col}
<D>__{ask him yourself.}
<A>__{she looks at fergus directly, sits down next to him.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{so tell me.}
<A>__{fergus says nothing. he shrugs.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{everybody wants something.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{not me.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{not you. how quainterior how old fashioned and quainterior isn't it, col?}
<A>__{col shrugs.}
<C>__{dil}

<C>__{dave}
<D>__{you fucking did.}
<A>__{he suddenly jerks her roughly off the stool, spilling her drink.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{didn't you? well, come on!}
<A>__{he drags her through the crowd. in the mirror, fergus watches them go. the barman eyes him.}
<C>__{col}
<D>__{it takes all types.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{so who's he?}
<C>__{col}

<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{then why doesn't she?}
<C>__{col}

<A>__{fergus suddenly stands and makes his way to the door.}
