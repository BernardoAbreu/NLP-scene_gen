<A>__{stephen doesn't even pause and enters the building. brian hesitates a beat, then follows.}
<L>__{interior tenement building day}
<A>__{where they bomb up a staircase just as a wall of fire lashes down, knocking them on their ass. stephen jumps to his feet with an axe as brian struggles to get up.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{don't take that kind of shit from it! don't let it know you're scared! come on!}
<A>__{stephen, with just his axe, chases up the stairs at the fire, hammering at the flaming boards. the fire retreats into another room, slamming the door shut behind it. brian struggles up the stairs. the two of them slide up on either side of the closed door, stephen cradling his axe like a swat team shotgun. the door breathes in and out and something animal scratches and snarls on the other side. brian can feel the panic rising in his throat. that thing behind the door, that slobbering, evil thing. it wants out. it wants... him.}

<D>__{christ, stephen, let's wait for the hose team...}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{listen to it, brian... jump when i say... it won't get us.}
<A>__{stephen hammers the lock with his axe and kicks the door open. a wall of flame roars out past their cheeks, then backwashes in.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{stephen picks up the door, and using it as a shield charges into the flames. brian tries to follow but the fire wells up, cutting him off. he hesitates. it's that goddamn flame again, leering at him. daring him. it bucks suddenly, dropping brian to his knee. he groans in pain. and now adcox and grindle are coming up the stairs with a hoseline washing down the room. clouds of furious steam bellow out and across the ceiling. nobody could be alive in there. except stephen. his entire outfit smoldering, he emerges from the clouds like a fucking god, carrying in one arm a gasping child.}
