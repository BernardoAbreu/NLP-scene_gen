<A>__{and we see the 2nd. workman. he is crouching over the mattress which is still in the middle of the floor of the otherwise empty room.}
<D>__{2nd. workman ... gimme a hand with this.}
<A>__{almost faster than the eye can register it, a hand shoots out from the mattress and grabs his wrist. he has about half a second to issue a strangled shout and then, hideously quickly, a matter of two seconds or so, his body is drained of all life and the dried husk collapses to the floor. the first workman appears hurriedly in the doorway and then freezes, an awestruck expression on his face. julia is rising, headfirst and upright, from the centre of the mattress. the movement is smooth, magical, unsettling. it is graceful but not slow. julia is fully fleshed, fully skinned, and fully dressed. she is in a replica of the dress malahide bought for her, but this one is jet black. she looks fabulous. as the workman stands open mouthed, her feet clear the mattress. but they don't stop there. she slows to a graceful halt about six inches above the mattress. she stretches and flexes her arms sensually. than her head swivels and her excited, aroused eyes meet those of the workman.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{i'm julia. love me.}
<A>__{suddenly, her head tips back and, accompanied by julia's delighted laughter, a wide beam of hell's black light flies at the ceiling from her open mouth. instantaneously, it spills across the ceiling and falls,like a fountain of blood, across the screen.}
