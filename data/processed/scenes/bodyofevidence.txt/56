<L>__{interior hallway afternoon}
<A>__{dulaney walks towards his office. biggs walks quickly down the hall and joins him.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{i've been waiting for you to get back.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you got something on the coke?}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{no but i got something.}
<A>__{biggs steps into dulaney's office. dulaney follows.}
<L>__{interior dulaney's office morning}
<A>__{biggs picks up a remote control off the desk and sits on the couch. dulaney sits at his desk.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{during lunch i was watching some of marsh's home videos.}
<A>__{biggs clicks the control. on the tv we see rebecca on top of marsh in the bedroom.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{he was really into recording this stuff. the d.a.'s office found a box full of tapes.}
<A>__{watching rebecca with marsh bothers dulaney.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{this girl has really got some moves, huh?}
<A>__{dulaney stands up and turns off the television.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{if you want to get your kicks go to a video store and rent a porno movie.}
<A>__{biggs studies dulaney for a moment. dulaney's reaction bothers him. he turns the tv back on and fast forwards the tape. the screen turns to snow where the tape has been recorded over.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{this tape was recorded over an existing recording.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{over what?}
<A>__{biggs raises a hand signaling patience. snow still fills the tv screen.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{i would have missed it but the phone rang and i let it play while i talked. it looks like blank tape but it isn't. it's been erased without any input signal coming in.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{so, what good is it to us if it's been erased?}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{it's very good because when the d.a's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{because it hasn't all been erased.}
<A>__{biggs looks at the screen. a beat. the snow dissolves and a picture fades in. the picture lasts only about five seconds. we see rebecca from the back as she straddles marsh, grinding up and down on the bed her hair flowing down her back. marsh raises his hand. his wrist is in a cast. she turns her head to the side and as she does we see that it is not rebecca but joanne braslow. the tape clicks off. dulaney stares at the blank screen.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(quoting joanne)}
<D>__{where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that.}
