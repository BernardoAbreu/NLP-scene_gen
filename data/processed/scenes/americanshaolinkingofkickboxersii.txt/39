<A>__{establishing shot of courtyard, drew all alone. the door to the temple opens and out comes san de, alone this time. he walks over to where drew is, stares at him for a moment, then sits down across from him. drew tries not to look at him. san de runs his hand across his bald pate and smiles.}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{my head is shiny enough already, don't you think?}
<A>__{drew, in shock at his ability to speak english, sputters}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you... you speak english? i'm sorry, i was just goofing... i apologize, master. i didn't mean to make fun of you...}
<A>__{san de shrugs it off. apology accepted.}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{what are you trying to do?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i want to become a monk they won't let me in... hey, you're just a grunt, a janitor sweeping up and all, don't sweat it. it's not your problem...}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{why are you sitting here?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i got the idea from a story about a monk who wouldn't leave. i thought...}
<A>__{san de nods.}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{has it been hard?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{it was at first. i was uncomfortable, in pain, actually, but as time went on, i got... into it, i guess. the sacrifice made me feel... in control, you know what i mean?}
<C>__{san de}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{much of the training at the temple is in that direction self sacrifice. tell me more.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{at first i was really bored, and very lonely. but then, things changed. maybe it's like hitting the wall in running it was like i became part of the courtyard, and i felt powerful. even the spider became my friend...}
<A>__{drew opens up his hand to reveal a spider sitting in his palm.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{it was an incredible experience i said i'd do it, and i did it.}
<A>__{san de, watching drew intently, smiles at this last. he stands up and bows to drew. drew bows back, from his seated position.}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{i wish you all the best.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{same to you.}
<A>__{san de turns and goes into the temple, leaving drew still sitting in the courtyard, the setting sun in the b.g.}
