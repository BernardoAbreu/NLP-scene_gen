<L>__{interior courtroom later}
<A>__{turner fires questions at sam a mile a minute.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{when you were lucy's age, were you living at home?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{were you living with your mother and father?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{well then where were you living?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(very quietly)}
<D>__{in an institution.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{so your parents put you in an institution?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{only after my mom got sick.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{what about your father? where was he?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{gone with the wind when sam was born.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{so, you weren't raised by your mother?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i saw her i saw her.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{christmas, easter and my birthday.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{oh, once a year on your birthday. so in a way, the people at the institution were your parents. were they nice to you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{some yes. some on. some yes.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{did they hit you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sometimes. sometimes they did sometimes.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{like when you hit lucy's friend at her birthday party?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{objection! nobody hit anybody!}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{let me rephrase that, strong armed. so what role model do you call upon as a father when you're parenting lucy? the head of the institution? the principal the warden?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no. not mr. whitehead. not him.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{then who?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{myself.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{you have the mental capacity of a seven year old. so you ask yourself, a seven year old }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i am not a seven year old.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{how to parent a fellow seven year old?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes. no. what was the question?}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{the question is: what makes you think you can be a parent? your background? your iq? your friends who can't even testify for you?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{objection }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{my friends }
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{objection }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{my friends love lucy even if rita thought they weren't smart enough to testify. even if she said you'd wipe the floor with them.}
<B>__{on rita}
<A>__{trying to telepathically reach sam.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{excuse me, mr. dawson, your lawyer just objected; that means you didn't have to answer the question. you can't even follow the simple rules you've watched here day after day. you really think you can raise a seven year old? a ten year old? a thirteen year old?}
<P>__{(in his face)}
<D>__{that means she'll be six years more advanced than you.}
<A>__{sweat pours down sam's coffee stained collar. he searches for words. then from the clearest place inside himself:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i've had a lot of time to think about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent. it has to do with constancy. it has to do with patience. it has to do with listening. to pretending to listen when you can't even listen anymore.}
<A>__{the court is riveted by sam's eloquence. rita's amazed.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{it has to do with love, like she says...}
<A>__{rita's antenna goes up: who's "she?"}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{and i don't know where it's written that a woman has a corner on that market, that a man has any less of those emotions than a woman. billy has a home with me! it's not perfect! i'm not a perfect parent! sometimes i forget he's just a little kid...}
<P>__{(whispers from the courtroom)}
<D>__{we built a life together and we love each other and if you destroy that, it may be irrep, irrep, irrep...}
<C>__{ifty}
<D>__{irreparable.}
<A>__{all eyes turn to the back of the room. ifty is there trying with all his might to help his friend.}
<C>__{ifty }
<D>__{joanne, don't do that, please. don't do it twice, not to him. then meryl streep can't even look at dustin hoffman after that.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{right, "kramer vs. kramer." thank you for the commentary, mr. bhutto. it's hard to find words isn't it, mr. dawson. it's confusing. it's confusing to know what to say to lucy half the time, isn't it?}
<A>__{mortified, so uncomfortable in this strange world, so at a loss how to swim through it, beginning to believe everything turner's saying, sam looks out at the faces in the courtroom. rita, stunned and incredulous; turner and his associate smirking at him; ifty, shaking his head; robert, his face in his hands; miss wright, margaret brown, the state's expert, almost willing him to fail. are they right? are they?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no, yes, no.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{no what?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{let me see let me see let me see.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{you don't know what?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{yes. you're right, you don't know. you don't know enough to really raise your daughter?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{objection. these aren't questions, these are attacks.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(frantic)}
<D>__{i am lucy's father.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{are you? are you really? i'm not talking about the fact that you got some homeless woman pregnant.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{objection your honor. i motion a recess.}
<C>__{judge mcneily}
<D>__{denied. get to the question, mr. turner.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{the question is if you love your daughter as much as they say you do don't you think she deserves more?! don't you? in your heart of hearts, secretly question yourself every day? don't you?!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{was that a "yes?"}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{objection.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes. she does. she deserves everything. in my heart of hearts.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{yes she does. and you agree with everyone, you can't give her that?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(in unbearable pain)}
<D>__{maybe. maybe everybody's right.}
<B>__{on turner}
<A>__{there. he got it.}
<B>__{on rita}
<A>__{anguished. watching sam unravel as he stands up and starts walking around in a circle in the witness box.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{no more no more! let it stop! no more! no more! no more!}
<A>__{the judge watches sam, sad and stunned. the verdict is obvious. sam has passed judgement on himself.}
