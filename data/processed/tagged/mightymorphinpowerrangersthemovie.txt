<D>__{in a time of great strife, a legendary interdimensional being known as zordon, came to the city of angel grove to establish a vanguard in the never ending struggle against evil. with the aid of his trusted assistant, alpha 5, the noble master sought out six extraordinary teenagers and gave them the power to transform into an unstoppable fighting force. in time of great need, the young heroes could now call upon colossal assault vehicles known as "zords". while the identity of the six remained a guarded secret, their courageous exploits soon became the stuff of legend, earning them the title... the mighty morphin power rangers.}

<L>__{exterior command center sunset}
<A>__{zordon's remote headquarters protrudes from a craggy mountain top silhouetted by a glorious sunset. the six streak of color slice downward into the roof.}
<L>__{interior conimand center night}
<A>__{everything's gone haywire buttons blink, emergency lights flash, there's a cacophony of electronic sounds. alpha 5 works frantically amidst the array of computer banks while zordon looks on from his column of light. the six rangers materialize, tommy turns to zordon.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{what's happening?}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{ay, yi, yi, yi, yi ! our thermionic sensors have been hit by a cataclysmic surge of evil!}
<C>__{zordon}
<D>__{rangers, you must act swiftly. the planet is in grave danger!}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{danger from what?}
<C>__{zordon}
<D>__{six thousand years ago a morphological being known as ivan ooze, ruled the world with a reign of unparalleled terror. finally, a rebel factor known as the "order of the meledon" lured him into a hyperlock chamber and buried him deep underground.}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{in a place that came to be known as angel grove.}
<C>__{zordon}
<D>__{the chamber has been accidently uncovered! you must return it to the depths. or anyone should open it and ivan is released!}
<C>__{alpha 5}
<D>__{to assist you i have retro fitted your helmets with new opti scan devices.}
<C>__{zordon}
<D>__{use extreme caution, rangers. you are dealing with an evil here that is beyond all comprehension.}
<L>__{exterior inner city construction site night}
<A>__{barricades and police tape surround the egg. a security guard passes his sleeping co worker, drops into a chair, sips his coffee. bzzwapp zedd, rita, goldar and a short, fat, furry creature named mordant appear.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{another saturday night and i'm traipsing around the galaxy with the three little pigs! my mother warned me this would happen! rita, she said, after 89 marriages you might wanna think about throwing in the towel. why didn't i listen to her?!}
<A>__{zedd grumbles to himself.}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{that's a good question.}
<A>__{the stunned guard stirs his sleeping buddy.}
<C>__{first security guard}
<D>__{uh... kurt... you might wanna take a look at this.}
<A>__{kurt looks up groggily.}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{no need to wake him. in fact, why don't you take a little nap yourself.}
<A>__{zedd zaps the guys with a bolt from his staff they are knocked out. goldar steps back from the blast and accidentally steps or mordant's foot. mordant knocks on goldar's metallic leg.}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{hey bonehead, get off my hoof!}
<A>__{goldar is oblivious. zedd, stands reverently before the glowing egg shape.}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{after two thousand years of searching... i have finally found you.}
<A>__{mordant bangs on goldar's leg again.}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{yo, earth to bigfoot!}
<A>__{goldar swats mordant.}
<C>__{goldar}
<D>__{watch your mouth, fuzz ball!}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{silence!}
<C>__{rita }
<D>__{where did you find this rabid little rodent, anyway?!}
<C>__{goldar}
<D>__{mordant's my second cousin three times removed on my mother's side. he`s just visiting for the summer.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{well put a muzzle on him!}
<A>__{mordant grumbles under his breath. meanwhile, zedd aims is staff at the chamber and bursts a blast of energy. the egg opens up with a whoosh of decompressing air. webs of electricity branch out, followed by a swirl of black smoke. when the smoke clears we see a bubbling, purple, phosphoscent ooze. the group gathers around rita sticks a finger in o the sticky substance.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{what... you spent two thousand years looking for this tub of snot!}
<A>__{as if in response, the ooze boils and froths. zedd and rita are too busy arguing to notice this.}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{don't you ever have anything nice to say?!}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{well, if i did i certainly wouldn't say it to you!}
<A>__{we hear a slithering slurping sound as the substance rises up and takes on the ghastly shape of ivan ooze. mordant tugs at zedd.}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{boss.}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{for your information this is not just your average, run of the mill tub of snot !}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{you're trying to tell me there`re different levels of snot?!}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{boss.}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{what!}
<A>__{zedd and rita finally notice ivan, standing with his lips apart, revealing jagged teeth, one of which is made of}
<B>__{glistening silver.}
<A>__{he stretches his sinewy arms, releases an enormous yawn, puts his hands on his head, cracks it.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{ahhhhhhhh.}
<A>__{now he smacks his lips together, opens his arms theatrically and gives his trademark stance.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen... the ooze is back!!}
<A>__{rita blushes.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{he's so cute.}
<A>__{zedd flashes her an angry look, turns back to ivan.}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{i am lord zedd, sworn enemy of all that is good and decent. it is a supreme honor to finally meet you.}
<A>__{ivan gives a slight bow.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{how can i ever repay you?}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{do you recall the name... zordon of eltare?}
<A>__{ivan's face goes dark, thunder rumbles and the site lights up with a flash of lightning. mordant turns to goldar.}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{seems to ring a bell.}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{i want you to destroy zordon, so that my evil may once again reign supreme.}
<C>__{ivan }
<D>__{i will not only destroy him, i will obliterate his entire being. it will be like zordon of eltare never existed!}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{finally, a real man.}
<A>__{goldar hands ivan a scrap of paper.}
<C>__{goldar}
<D>__{here's his address.}
<C>__{ivan }
<D>__{"... left off interstate 12?!"}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{what's an "interstate"?}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{it's like a freeway. how long have you been locked up? !}
<C>__{zedd}

<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{what is that odious stench?}
<A>__{his eyes come alive.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{smell's like... teenagers!}
<L>__{17 exterior construction site night}
<A>__{on cue, the power rangers teleport into the construction site. they're surrounded by rock piles, pools of water and a plethora of building supplies. billy looks down at the mud puddle he's standing in.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{remind me to have a word with alpha about his teleporting calculations.}
<A>__{they survey the construction site for a moment.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{anybody see anything?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{... let's take a look over there.}
<A>__{they advance up a slope the egg comes into view.}
<C>__{rocky }
<D>__{it looks like it's been opened!}
<A>__{the kids get close to the egg, looking it over with fascination. suddenly a hand falls on aisha.}
<D>__{security guard (o.s.} hey!}
<A>__{they all whirl around and see the first security guard. he half smiles, shaking his head.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{you had me scared there.}

<D>__{makes two of us.}
<C>__{kimberly}

<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{ooooh, where's my autoqraph book?.}
<A>__{he looks them over reproachfully.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{power rangers, huh? so zordon is still using a bunch of rug rats to do his dirty work. and speaking of rats...}
<A>__{ivan raises both hands electricity shoots out his fingers and the kids dive clear as the bolt zaps a throng of rats. now, incredibly, the rats grown into grunting, snarling man sized rat beasts.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{from this moment forth, the world as you know it shall cease to exist!}
<A>__{ivan raises his arms thunder crackles and lightning rips}
