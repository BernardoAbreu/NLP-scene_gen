<D>__{tommy riordan's captured the media's attention, but the question still remains: who is this guy? and more importantly, can he compete in this talent pool? can he win?}
<C>__{sheridan }
<D>__{i wish i knew, bryan. i wish i knew who he was, and i've gotta say the fact that i don't know is strange. in an internet age where there are no secrets, this guy is a complete mystery. i can't find out anything about him. tommy riordan is officially google proof.}
<A>__{tommy continues to storm toward the cage with a furious and focused look on his face. he seems to want nothing to do with paddy. training is over. it's time to fight.}

<D>__{you gotta love this guy, sam. no walk out music, no sponsors, no interviews. he skipped out on the press conference. wouldn't have his picture take for the program. he's breaking every rule!}

<D>__{the only reason that tommy is even in this tournament is because of a video showing him beating up mad dog grimes in the gym.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{but the reason a lot of his fans are in the stands is because of another video, which is even more stunning than the mad dog grimes video. let me describe it for you folks for the few who haven't seen it, and i don't know anyone who hasn't, but tommy riordan ripped the door off a tank in the heat of battle, saving lives in the process, and then walked away without claiming a medal. he ripped the door off a tank!}

<D>__{tommy riordan is a genuine war hero, i'm not taking anything away from the guy. he's a very, very tough guy, bryan, but the tank don't hit back. we've seen youtube sensations fail on the big stage before.}
<A>__{tommy stands outside the cage and has vaseline applied to his face. he looks like he's ready to murder someone.}
