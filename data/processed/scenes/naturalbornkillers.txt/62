<D>__{it was dramatic license, no doubt. but i felt an operatic love story needed an operatic ending. the two of them kill for each other. they offer the death of their victims to each other like other lovers offer flowers or bon bons. so what more natural, what more organic, what more poetic than mallory offering her death to mickey? it's where it's been leading since day one. we worked it in the movie by using a what if they escaped situation. i think it works beautifully. you'd be surprised. people come up to me at the end of the movie in tears.}
