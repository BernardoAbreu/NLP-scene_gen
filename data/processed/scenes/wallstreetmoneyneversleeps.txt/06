<L>__{interior keller, zabel investments trading floor morning}
<A>__{a large space lined with long desks that hold five traders each. each trader has two phones and three huge monitors in front of them. it's loud and frenetic. most of the traders are under thirty five, it's a young person's game. jacob heads in and takes his seat at his desk. it's larger than the others and anchors the room... this is his domain. fox business plays on each of the screens that line the space ubiquitous. (a note, when possible, business news will be droning from television sets throughout this movie in bg... as it is the current soundtrack of new york these days) a trader named willy shouts out...}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{jake, glass works is up nine points on earnings, you want to unload some?}
<A>__{jacob confirms...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yeah, let's get closer to home.}
<A>__{a trader named audry turns to jacob.}
<C>__{audry}
<P>__{(to jacob, re willy)}
<D>__{where's his hat?}
<A>__{willy glares at her.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{mind your own business, audry.}
<C>__{audry}
<D>__{i had to wear pfizer on my forehead for a full week... so post it up, bitch.}
<A>__{willy pleads with jacob...}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{c'mon jake, it's embarrassing.}
<A>__{jacob just shrugs...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{the stock goes down, you wear the crown... them's the rules.}
<A>__{audry grins in victory. willy shakes his head, grabs a marker, scribbles something down on a post it then places it on his forehead. it reads "i bought toll brothers at $24" and he has to wear it all week. and jacob laughs... now looking up at the electronic ticker... kzi $60.21... $2.25...}
