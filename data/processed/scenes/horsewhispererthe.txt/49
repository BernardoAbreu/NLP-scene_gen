<L>__{exterior grace's school day}
<A>__{annie is crossing an empty school yard. grace is sitting on the ground, her back against a wall, her "legs" in front of her. she has been crying. she looks up to her mother.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's too hard.}
<A>__{annie kneels before her sympathetically brushing her hair away:}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, honey... what happened?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{doesn't matter. i... i don't want to come back, that's all.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{oh. well, what are you going to do? you have to go to school, honey. i mean, what }
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(snaps)}
<D>__{i'm not coming back! that's it! i want to go home!}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{grace, listen to me. your body is just healing. you have to give the rest of you time as well...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{is that your version of a pep talk?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. you're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(snotty)}
<D>__{fine!}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it's still early. what's your next class?}
<A>__{with secret delight, grace viciously utters the word:}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{gym!}
