<A>__{mary is gently escorted into a tiny room. a small, hissing gas jet in the wall bathes the scene with green light. stanton, speed, general henry halleck and a minister, are standing. welles sits by the head of the bed. dr. charles leale, a young army surgeon, and dr. robert stone, the lincoln family's doctor, stand uselessly by the foot of the bed, while dr. joseph barnes, the surgeon general, listens to lincoln's faint breathing. robert, in uniform, red eyed, pale as a ghost, sits at the bedside and stares at his father, barely breathing. lincoln lies in a crooked diagonal, his knees bent, on a bed he's too tall to fit properly, clad only in a nightshirt. barnes moves his head closer, then closer. the room is utterly still. barnes takes out his watch, looks at the time, softly clears his throat.}
