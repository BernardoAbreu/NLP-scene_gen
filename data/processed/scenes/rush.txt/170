<L>__{interior pits various day}
<A>__{in the pits alongside james... a series of shots of the other drivers...being sent out like lambs to the slaughter... visibly terrified, mouthing prayers, smoking last cigarettes, meditating, crossing themselves, hands shaking.. among them the japanese drivers. all laughter gone now. realizing what they've got into. risking their lives. finally we come to rest on niki. strangely calm. niki puts on his balaclava over his still raw wounds, wincing with pain as he puts on his helmet..}
