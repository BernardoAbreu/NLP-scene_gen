<A>__{as helen crosses the room to greet tom stevens. he's a personable young man with a breezy manner and considerable charm. there is between them an easy air of intimacy.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(smiling warmly)}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{tom kisses her.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{we're all set. i picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. and the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(a little disturbed)}
<D>__{there's only one thing i haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with bobby.}
<P>__{(tentatively)}
<D>__{i don't suppose we could take him with us?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(understandably unenthusiastically)}
<D>__{well, we could }
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{there's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.}
<C>__{klaatu's voice}
<D>__{i haven't any plans.}
<A>__{helen and tom turn in surprise.}
<B>__{three shot}
<A>__{including klaatu, who has wandered in from the dining room, unnoticed by tom and helen. klaatu continues, with an air of wanting to be helpful without wanting to interfere.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{i'd be glad to spend the day with him if you'd let me.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(impulsively)}

<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(hesitating, a little}
<D>__{confused, by the}
<P>__{offer)}
<D>__{it's awfully nice of you to suggest it.}
<P>__{(remembering the two men haven't met)}
<D>__{i'm sorry mr. carpenter this is tom stevens.}
<A>__{the two men shake hand's and exchange how do you do's. then klaatu turns back to helen.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{bobby and i had a fine time yesterday afternoon. we talked and listened to the radio.}
<P>__{(smiling at helen)}
<D>__{i thought today he might show me around the city.}
<A>__{helen is debating the matter in her mind, concerned about leaving bobby with a comparative stranger, but tempted because of her favorable impression of klaatu.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(easily)}
<D>__{suppose i ask bobby how he feels about it.}
<A>__{he turns, with a little smile, and starts out of the room. helen, still not quite decided, turns to tom with a questioning look. tom nods.}
