<A>__{friedrich continues to stroke topthorn's head. joey pushes topthorn as if to stop him falling into unconsciousness. for a moment we think topthorn will come round but he slips away and all life leaves his body. friedrich solemnly strokes the horse, knowing all is lost. joey does not understand. he pulls at topthorn's reins, as if trying to pull him upright. topthorn's body is inert, his head falls to the earth. joey will not give up, he pulls at him desperately not understanding that topthorn has died. suddenly, friedrich looks around. chaos all the german soldiers stream back past their position, scrambling to get their guns and helmets. an officer charges down the bank next to the bridge, screaming orders at friedrich.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{they're coming! leave it, private!}
<A>__{friedrich tries to pull joey away to safety but joey will not leave topthorn's body. friedrich pulls at joey, but joey is too lost in his grief to care about or even notice the danger.}
<C>__{german officer }
<D>__{leave it! come with me!}
<C>__{friedrich}
<D>__{go to hell!}
<A>__{the officer nods to two other soldiers who pull friedrich to safety. as he's dragged away, he screams at joey:}
<C>__{friedrich }
<D>__{run. run! run! run!}
<A>__{but this is all background noise to joey's profound refusal to accept topthorn is dead. he paws at the ground next to topthorn, a horse standing over his best friend in a field, and he will never leave him. and then suddenly from around a blind turn in the streambed, a huge, remorseless tank turns, heading right for joey. he bolts, galloping down the streambed, until he reaches a barbed wire barrier a dead end. he attempts to run up the banks, but they're blocked, as well. he rears up, but the tank keeps advancing. the tank is about to crush joey. he has left it too late. he is about to die. but then, counter intuitively, he runs straight towards the tank and...leaps over it a leap he learnt from emilie. then scrambles up and over it and leaps down behind. joey keeps on running. he is wild, frightened.}
