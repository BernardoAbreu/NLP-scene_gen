<A>__{epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over her in the cavernous space. she moves into a narrowing passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into the depths of the ship. finally the passage opens into yet another compartment, apparently a cargo hold. crates and boxes are stacked on loading palettes. in the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. epps comes to it. she lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to reveal a 1951 ferrari sportster. for the exception of a coat of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly preserved. mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more wooden crates and palettes, when something catches epps' eye. a heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, as though blown back from some terrific explosive force. epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. she shines her light inside. a clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. she swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object between broken wood slats. epps steps in. she kneels, shining the light closer. the yellow glint is metal. epps pulls back a slat, sliding away some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram ingot of gold. she reaches out. she raises it, completely untouched by the years. she pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. she slides away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high and five feet across. a beat as epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in gold.}
