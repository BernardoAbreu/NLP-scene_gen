<L>__{exterior baronial estate tight moving view day}
<A>__{a boy, eight or nine, with wide, frightened eyes, being pulled quickly by the hand. this is vito andolini, who is to become the godfather. the view alters revealing that he is being pulled along by his mother, the widow, across a field leading to the ornamental gates of a baronial estate of some forgotten noble. at various positions near the gates are men with shotguns, or lupara. the gates are opened; and the widow and her boy are shown before don francesco, a man in his sixties. he wears his trousers with suspenders, and an open white shirt sloppily tucked in over his enormous belly. he wears a hat to protect him from the white hot sun, and proudly displays a gold watch and chain over his vest. he sits in a chair, near a group of his men in the garden, listening to the widow, who stands before him with her only son.}
<C>__{widow}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{don francesco. you murdered my husband, because he would not bend. and his oldest son paolo, because he swore revenge. but vitone is only nine, and dumb witted. he never speaks.}
<C>__{don francesco}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{i'm not afraid of his words.}
<C>__{widow}
<P>__{(sicilian)}

<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{the child cannot harm you.}
<C>__{don francesco}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{he will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.}
<A>__{as she pleads, the widow moves closer to the don, until she has practically thrown herself to her knees before him.}
<C>__{widow}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{i beg you, don francesco, spare my only son. he is all i have. in the name of the holy spirit, i swear he will never be a danger to you...}
<A>__{suddenly, she reaches under her skirt, where she has hidden a kitchen knife.}
<C>__{widow}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{but i will kill you myself!}
<P>__{(she lunges at the mafia chieftain)}
<D>__{vitone, go!}
<A>__{the boy runs as fast as he can out through the gates. then there is a lupara blast. he turns, and sees his mother flung a distance of five feet from the short range of the terrible blast of the shotgun. then he sees the men turn their attention to him. one fires at him; but the boy is quick, and disappears into a grove of olive trees.}
