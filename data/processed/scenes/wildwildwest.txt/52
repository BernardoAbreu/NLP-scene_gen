<D>__{that's a man's head!}
<A>__{gordon holds up a strange, circular metallic object.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{... and this magnetic collar was around it when his body was discovered. haven't figured that one out yet...}
<A>__{but west is still staring in disbelief at the head.}

<D>__{that's a man's head.}
<A>__{gordon starts fiddling with a lantern positioned behind the head.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{according to the retinal terminus theory... a dying person's last conscious image is burned into the back of the eyeball like a photograph. perhaps there's a clue there...}
<A>__{excited, gordon turns on the lantern attached to the back of his head. beams of light are coming through his eyeballs, creating a blurry color image on the wall.}

<A>__{west takes the bifocals out of the box, casually puts them on morton's nose. west now gestures to the wall. close image on wall the white blur in the man's pocket is now focused. we can see that it's the top of a piece of paper. he reads the writing on it.}
