<L>__{interior jedi temple, main hallway day}
<A>__{obi wan walks through the main hallway to the training area.}
<L>__{interior jedi temple, training veranda day}
<A>__{obi wan comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching twenty or so four year olds doing training exercises, supervised by yoda. they wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little training droids with their miniature lightsabers. the droids dance in front of them.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{don't think... feel... be as one with the force. help you, it will.}
<P>__{(he sees obi wan)}
<D>__{younglings enough! a visitor we have. welcome him.}
<A>__{the children take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers.}
<C>__{yoda}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{master obi wan kenobi, meet the mighty bear clan.}
<C>__{children}
<D>__{welcome, master obi wan! obi wan i am sorry to disturb you, master.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{what help to you, can i be? obi wan im looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. i trust him. but the system doesnt show up on the archive maps.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{an interesting puzzle. gather round the map reader, younglings. master obi wan has lost a planet. find it, we will try...}
<A>__{the map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. the cchildren gather around it. obi wan takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. the window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. the children laugh. some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. obi wan walks into the display.}
<D>__{obi wan this is where it ought to be... but it isnt. gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. there should be a star here... but there isnt.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{most interesting. gravitys silhouette remains, but the star and all its planets have disappeared. how can this be?}
<A>__{there is a brief pause. then a child puts its hand up. yoda nods.}
<C>__{jedi child jack}
<D>__{because someone erased it from the archive memory.}
<C>__{children}
<D>__{thats right! yes! thats what happened! someone erased it!}
<C>__{jedi child may}
<D>__{if the planet blew up, the gravity would go away.}
<A>__{obi wan stares; yoda chuckles.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{truly wonderful, the mind of a child is. uncluttered. to the centre of the pull of gravity go, and find your planet you will. obi wan but master yoda who could have erased information from the archives? thats impossible, isnt it?}
<C>__{yoda}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{much harder to answer, that question is.}
