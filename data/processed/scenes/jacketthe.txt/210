<T>__{bleeding cut :}
<A>__{on his head and no coat in the cold, starks is someone we see she wants to be near. then we see jackie as starks does: she looks beautiful, alive, happy and just like the woman he never wanted to leave. she approaches starks warmly, less suspicious of the world and less devastated by it than we remember her being.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{hey there. [beat] you ok?}
<A>__{starks revels in the moment. in their reunion.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you're bleeding pretty bad there.}
<A>__{starks touches his forehead in a panic and, seeing the blood on his hands, looks up at her, terrified. sensing this, she moves closer to calm him.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it's ok. it's ok. relax. it's just a cut. we can get it fixed.}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{but we need to get you to the hospital now. how'd you get that?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i fell down. [beat] but i'm alive.}
<A>__{starks looks at her immensely relieved and grateful.}
<D>__{jackie [laughing a little] yes, you are alive. but, listen, it's new year's day. you're not going to get a cab. especially not here. and you're gonna freeze if you stand out here in the snow much longer. i'm on my way back to my shift at the hospital...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you work there? jackie [gesturing to her uniform] yeah, i'm a nurse. why don't you let me give you a ride...}
<A>__{starks falters slightly as he walks. jackie helps him make it to the car, much like before...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{thanks.}
