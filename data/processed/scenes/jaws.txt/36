<L>__{exterior island highway the billboard day}
<A>__{next to the "amity welcomes you" billboard is a group of selectmen, vaughn, meadows, hendricks, and another deputy standing by with paint and brushes. brody's wagon is there, along with a few other cars. busy late afternoon traffic is starting to pile up as early weekenders and curiosity seekers slow down to see what's happening. behind the billboard, brody and hooper have gotten vaughn to one side. they are making a closely reasoned presentation to him.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{there is a kind of shark called a great white shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{you're situation here suggests that a great white has staked out a claim in the waters around amity island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{there's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. it happened like this before, in 1916, when a great white killed five swimmers at jones beach, in long island.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{a shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming you can't avoid it!}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{a 4th of july beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for chrissake!}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{i just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{we towed ben gardner's boat in, larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{is that tooth here? did anyone see it?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{i don't have it.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{he lost it on the way up.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{what kind of a shark did you say it was?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{carcaradon carcharias. a great white.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{well, i'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. we depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{we have got to close the beaches. we have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... it's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{i don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{i'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! there are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{that means closing the beaches.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{come here, i want to show you something.}
<A>__{he leads brody around to the front of the billboard, on which we see that some pranksters have painted a huge shark fin in the water behind the swimmer, so she looks now like a frantic bather fleeing a pursuing monster.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{sick vandalism! brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! i want those little paint happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby buster browns!}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(who has followed them around)}
<D>__{that's it! i'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. goodbye.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{wait a minute! i need you.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{out there is a perfect engine, an eating machine that is a miracle of evolution it swims and eats and that's all. look at that! those proportions are correct.}
<P>__{(indicates fin)}
<D>__{i know sharks.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{you'd love to prove that. getting your name in the national geographic.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{larry, we can re open the beaches in august.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{august! tomorrow is the 4th of july, and we are going to open for business. it's going to be our best summer in years. if you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.}
