<T>__{in the procedure room:}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{i will get her...}
<L>__{interior campbell center day}
<A>__{a worried novak searches the halls of the campbell center. he's about to ask the staff for help, but stops when he sees through the window to edward's room.}
<L>__{interior campbell center edward's room}
<A>__{catherine sits next to the boy's bed, holding edward's hand, softly singing a lullaby (to him, to herself). feeling that he must speak to her, novak intervenes.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{edward baines, i presume.}
<P>__{(to the catatonic child)}
<D>__{hi, ed. i'm pete.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{do you think that's funny?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{no. not at all. from what i understand, he knows i"m here, isn't that right?}
<A>__{catherine nods. novak picks up edward's fallen teddy bear and rests it in the crook of the child's arm.}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{i read about a woman in texas who was in a coma for seven years. every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster. isn't that something? i don't know what name scientists have for something like that...}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{it doesn't have much to do with science.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{what then?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{the soul. the spirit. whatever you want to call it.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{ah, the part of us that can't be explained.}
<A>__{she appreciates his understanding. and finds herself comforted by his presence. catherine scrutinizes novak, his intensity, his honesty, his complexity. and asks:}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{agent novak?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{peter, okay?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?}
<A>__{the question catches novak off guard, but he's willing to answer. anything to get her talking.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<P>__{(realizing it's too personal)}
<D>__{i suppose everyone does.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{just like we all have fantasies, right? things only we know, that we don't share.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{that's what therapists are for, right?}
<A>__{catherine laughs. it helps her relax. if only slightly.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{during the sessions. when i'm inside. i see those things. what a person hides, what they despite, what they want to control. with stargher...}
<A>__{this is difficult for her.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{with stargher i saw things...}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{what did you see?}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(professionally)}
<D>__{a kingdom. his utopia. life without consequence or restriction. he's not even carl stargher anymore. he's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... without fear. a horrible primitive ugly thing.}
<P>__{(uncomfortable; re: edward)}
<D>__{i don't want to talk in here.}
<A>__{she kisses edward's forehead and exits.}
