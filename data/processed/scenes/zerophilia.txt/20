<A>__{sydney stands at the bar with a cup of coffee, chatting with jeremy.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{this shirt? i've had it for years.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{well, it's very sexy. i love men's clothes. what else have you got in your closet?}
<A>__{jeremy smiles, unsure what she means. when polly approaches, her eyes a little red, jeremy pulls her aside.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{polly, are you alright? didn't mean to walk in on you.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{oh, hon. i'm fine, thanks. love, tears. that's the trade off.}
<A>__{she puts a hand to his cheek, reassuring. jeremy ducks behind the bar.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{my god, he's gorgeous.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{yes, he's a michelangelo. and the sweetest boy in the world. sorry, darling, i'm afraid you'll find he's not your type.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{oh, we'll see about that.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{i think he may prefer men.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i certainly hope so.}
<A>__{keenan and janine enter.}
<C>__{sydney }
<D>__{you two better have a seat.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{is luke alright?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{he should have full control over this now. something must be really confusing him. the only thing i can think of...}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{when he became luca, was he attracted to one of you? you can get really thrown by that. janine?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{no. not me.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{well, he sure as hell wasn't attracted to me.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{no. definitely not.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{wasn't it just the two of you?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{not exactly.}
<A>__{janine glances to keenan, as his eyes go wide, grossed out.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{oh, give me a break! no way! max?! they just had a huge fight. he tried to beat the crap out of him!}
<A>__{janine and sydney exchange a knowing look.}
<C>__{keenan }
<D>__{oh, christ, luke's not queer! he was just turnin' into a girl!}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{exactly. he was a girl.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{oh! this is just wrong.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{would you rather she was attracted to me?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{would you?!}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{maybe i would!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{whoa! hang on! right now, luke needs your help. he needs to know you're behind him, no matter what he wants.}
<A>__{janine nods.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{so, what's all this mean?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{bottom line? maybe luca really likes this boy, enough to want to be female.}
<C>__{janine}
<P>__{(to keenan)}
<D>__{don't sneer!}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{oh, come on! i know the guy. we've done all kinds a' shit together: hoops, hockey!}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{oh, and girls can't play sports?!}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{oh, whatever! christ, janine! why the hell would he want to be a girl?!}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{that's so hard to imagine?!}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{uh, yeah!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{hey! listen up! i know what i'm talking about. you see this?}
<A>__{sydney pulls out a snapshot, shows it to janine.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{who's he? an ex? ...oh, my god.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{ex me.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{you're one too? you're a z? you're a guy?!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{was. i made a terrible mistake.}
<A>__{she and keenan keep staring at the photo...}
<C>__{sydney }
<D>__{and once you finally figure out who you are, it's a horrible thing not being yourself. that's why it's crucial we help luke.}
<A>__{janine nods, grasping the significance. keenan keeps looking from the photo to sydney and back again.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{you musta' worked out.}
