<L>__{interior museum restoration studio day (moments later)}
<A>__{dana is working on a valuable flemish still life by ver meer. janosz is at the other end of the room, still working on the painting of vigo. venkman enters and sneaks up behind dana.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(looking at the ver meer)}
<D>__{so this is what you do, huh?}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(glad to see him)}
<D>__{oh, hello, peter.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{you're really good, you know.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{i didn't paint it. i'm just cleaning it. it's an original ver meer. it's worth about ten million dollars.}
<B>__{vigo}
<A>__{he turns his head and watches venkman and dana.}
<B>__{venkman}
<A>__{unaware that he's being watched, venkman squints at the still life, holding up his thumb like he's seen artists do.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{you know you can go to art world and get these huge sofa size paintings for about forty five bucks.}
<A>__{he starts looking around at the other artwork in the studio.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{i'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, i stopped by to tell you that i haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.}
<A>__{they are interrupted by the sudden appearance of janosz.}
<C>__{janosz}
<P>__{(smiling at venkman)}
<D>__{dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. this is peter venkman. peter, janosz poha.}
<A>__{venkman warily shakes his hand, trying to size him up.}
<C>__{janosz}
<P>__{(avoiding his gaze)}
<D>__{pleasure to meet you. i've seen you on television.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{how are you?}
<P>__{(looking over at the vigo painting)}
<D>__{what's that you're working on, johnny?}
<A>__{janosz winces at the nickname but lets it go. venkman and dana cross to the vigo painting. janosz steps protectively in front of it.}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{it's a painting i'm restoring for the new byzantine exhibition. it's a self portrait of prince vigo, the carpathian. he ruled most of carpathia and moldavia in the 17th century.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(staring at the painting)}
<D>__{too bad for the moldavians.}
<C>__{janosz}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{he was a very powerful magician. a genius in many ways and quite a skilled painter.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{he was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. i hate this painting. i've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room. you know what it needs?}
<P>__{(picking up a brush)}
<D>__{a fluffy little white kitten in the corner.}
<A>__{venkman reaches toward the painting, but janosz grabs his hand.}
<C>__{janosz}
<P>__{(with forced good will)}
<D>__{we don't go around altering valuable paintings, dr. venkman.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{well, i'd make an exception in this case if i were you.}
<A>__{dana looks disapprovingly at venkman.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(to janosz)}
<D>__{i will let you get back to it. nice meeting you.}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{my pleasure.}
<A>__{venkman and dana cross back to her workspace.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{i may be wrong, but i think you've got a little crush on this guy.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{good bye, peter.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(dragging his feet)}
<D>__{i'd like to stay, but i really don't have time to hang around here. i will call you.}
<P>__{(calls out to janosz)}
<D>__{later, johnny!}
<A>__{he exits.}
<B>__{vigo}
<A>__{vigo turns his head and follows dana as she returns to her workbench.}
<B>__{dana}
<A>__{she stops, vaguely aware of the movement, and looks up curiously at the painting. as she starts to walk on, vigo looks at her again, but dana turns suddenly and catches the movement. frightened now, she hastily leaves the studio.}
