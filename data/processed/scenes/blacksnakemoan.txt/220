<B>__{quick cuts}
<A>__{the chain, tight around rae as she struggles. rae panting and sweating on laz's floor. she reaches out. her hand lands on the strings of his guitar. a single string is plucked.}
<T>__{flash back to:}
<L>__{exterior freeway interior ronnie & rae's new car day}
<A>__{rae opens her eyes the low note still sounding in her head. she places her hand back on his neck. and then, soft as a prayer:}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{you are my sunshine. my only sunshine. you make me happy, when times are gray.}
<A>__{ronnie slowly turns and looks at rae, his head still resting on the steering wheel. the panting has slowed. color starts returning to his cheeks.}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{you'll never know dear, how much i love you. please don't take, my sunshine away.}
<A>__{the anxiety is gone. ronnie takes a breath and looks at rae, humbled and thankful of her power to soothe him.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{see. we're okay.}
<A>__{rae is smiling.}
