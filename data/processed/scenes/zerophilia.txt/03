<L>__{exterior langford university morning}
<A>__{students crisscross on bikes in front of the quadrangle. the huge round headlights and muscular front grill of an old semi truck rumbles up to the curb. it's the cab only, like the sliced off front of a train engine. luke hops down, startling his friends, keenan and janine, passionately making out on the sidewalk. twenty, brainy and athletic, janine adjusts her glasses, the only remnant of a bookish past, as she thoughtfully considers luke's massive truck.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{it's remarkable. sort of retro. i thought you were gettin' a pickup?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i changed my mind.}
<A>__{hoping for a more enthusiastic response, he turns to keenan, who climbs up and peeks inside the cab. he's rugged, streetwise, perpetually bemused, maybe ed norton and bill murray had a son...}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{it's awesome. it's pleather.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{fuck you. you think it's stupid.}
<A>__{janine stares at him.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{she shrugs, trying to put her finger on it, and when luke rolls up his t shirt sleeves, she grins.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{oh my god. you got laid. finally! who is she?}
<A>__{luke glares at keenan.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{i didn't say a word! i swear! you know janine. she's got x ray vision.}
<P>__{(to janine)}
<D>__{camping! a total stranger.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i knew that whole "waitin' to meet the right girl" thing was crap. congratulations! i have to get to physics. the truck's great.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{see ya', hottie.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{could find something to call me, other than what every guy in the world would say?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{"sweetheart?" "babe?" "aphrodite?"}
<A>__{janine sneers. at a loss, keenan grabs her and kisses her passionately. she walks off rolling her eyes, but secretly loves it. keenan climbs up into the cab.}
<C>__{keenan }
<D>__{so this is gonna' be like your car?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{look, i know it's dopey. but don't you recognize it? it's painted and the muffler's switched out, but this was my dad's.}
<A>__{keenan looks around with fresh eyes. he reaches an arm way up under the glove box and grins, pulling out a small stash of weed.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{ten years. a little dried out.}
