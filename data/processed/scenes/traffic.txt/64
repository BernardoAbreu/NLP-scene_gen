<L>__{interior san diego jail day}
<A>__{in the intake area of a busy san diego precinct, helena sits on a bench and regroups. detectives move past her. handcuffed criminals are separated, bagged and tagged. beautifully dressed man, arnie metzger, 30's, super lawyer, knows everyone from the top of the system to the bottom, slick but likable, smart and ruthless, too, separates himself from a detective he's gladhanding and approaches helena.}
<C>__{arnie}
<D>__{helena, i'm so sorry }
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{arnie, thank god.}
<A>__{metzger sits, giving her a hug.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{can you please tell me what on earth is going on?}
<A>__{arnie looks at her as if to say, "do you really not know?" then, he speaks quietly with his hand in front of his mouth.}
<C>__{arnie}
<D>__{i understand. you're upset. you want to know what's going on. that's good.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{why are you talking like that?}
<C>__{arnie}
<D>__{listen to me carefully. first of all, carl isn't here. dea's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow. so here you're wasting your time. are you with me?}
<A>__{he checks to see if this is registering.}
<C>__{arnie}
<D>__{good. from now on i want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. got it?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{arnie, this is crazy.}
<A>__{he makes eye contact with her.}
<C>__{arnie}
<D>__{got it?}
<P>__{(she slowly nods)}
<D>__{good. do not discuss anything over the telephone. do not talk to the neighbors. stay out of your yard.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{what is he being charged with?}
<C>__{arnie}
<D>__{i don't know, but under no circumstances would i talk about it here. i want you to go home and relax the best you can. continue your life as if nothing has happened. that is very important.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{arnie, i feel like alice stepping through the looking glass.}
<C>__{arnie}
<D>__{that's a very apt analogy, helena. now, go home and be with your children.}
