<L>__{interior abandoned church afternoon}
<A>__{somerset pushes the door. he and bleeker enter from the classroom into the far back corner of the church. big church. shafts of colored light needle through the holes in the pieces of wood and cloth that cover the broken stained glass windows. somerset walks down the center aisle between deteriorated pews. rats run. pigeons flap about, dirt drifting off their wings. somerset shines his flashlight forward to the rather barren altar. to the right, at the top of the altar stairs, there is a stone statue of a saint with his arms outstretched, welcoming. the life size saint is covered in spider webs. tiny spiders crawl across his eyes, which look down on somerset.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{saint jerome emiliani. the patron saint of orphans.}
<A>__{somerset shines the flashlight against the back altar wall, revealing a wooden carving of christ crucified.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{is this still the lord's house?}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{of course it is.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{and, even if father stone was guilty of everything... if he was hurting children here? it's still the lord's house?}
<A>__{father bleeker finds this talk insulting and offensive.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{you have no faith, somerset? have you given up on the church entirely?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{that's not what i've given up on.}
<A>__{somerset notices two ends of a thick rope suspended from the ceiling above the center of the altar. he looks up, following the rope with the flashlight, when he notices something else. his mouth drops. bleeker looks, and is equally horrified. above them, in the beam of light: seven large paintings on panels tilted forward at the curve of the ceiling above the altar. seven ancient paintings; seven deadly sins. the beam of light moves to the panel to the immediate right: a painting of a man kneeling, grasping at gold coins all around him. the man is naked, as was the victim of the greed murder. the chief color in this panel is a vulgar yellow. the third in the series is sloth. the painting, in indigo, shows a man at rest in a pliant bed. the skeletal man's eyes are rolled up in their sockets. he is covered in slimy worms.}
