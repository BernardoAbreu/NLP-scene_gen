<L>__{interior a van bus night}
<A>__{a head rubbing hawk and a stomach rubbing alex kneel on the floor of a moving van, over a barely legible drawing of what was so neatly delineated on the cia computer. both guys are dressed as priests and are chewing gum.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{we're going in from the ground floor.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{geez, this art treasures room looks like a burnt diaphragm.}
<A>__{hawk laughs and pops up into the passenger seat. anna is revealed to be driving in her habit. hawk gives her a kiss.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{uh, yeah. guess i'm a wee bit nervous. i'm sorry i could only score clergy passports.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{fits my new image. a thief for the masses. this is one job i'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying. gum.}
<A>__{hawk, alex, and anna all spit out their gum into a bag hawk holds.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{the security's actually not that severe.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it doesn't have to be. everybody knows that if you mess with the kremlin, you'll end up in a siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.}
<A>__{hawk takes in some views of moscow that remind one of budapest.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{shwoof, that makes me feel better. i can't believe this is the iron curtain. all the guy at airport customs wanted to know was "who shot j.r.?"}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you sound disappointed.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{yeah, i mean, come on, going through the iron curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard...}
<B>__{the van}
<A>__{passes a textbook shot of the kremlin in the distance.}
<C>__{hawk }
<D>__{it's supposed to be parachuting in the moonlight....}
