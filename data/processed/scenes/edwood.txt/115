<D>__{...lemme tell you, you can't lose. it's scary! and if you don't like that, it's romantic! bela lugosi portrays dr. vornoff, and lovely ingenue loretta king is reporter janet lawton.}

<A>__{vampira stares, totally uncomprehending.}
<C>__{vampira}
<D>__{i don't understand. do you want my autograph?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{no. i think my film is perfect for you.}
<C>__{vampira}

<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(unyielding)}
<D>__{no! i don't want you to show the movie, i want you to be in it ! see, maybe i should explain: we started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down. so we're having a backers party, to raise some more money. perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?}
<A>__{vampire glances at her friends. they uncomfortably turn away.}
<C>__{vampira}
<D>__{uh, look, i'm with some friends, and we're about to eat }

<C>__{backer}
<P>__{(to another backer)}
<D>__{i'm getting a bad feeling about this. let's get out of here.}
<A>__{the backers pick up their coats. through the doorway, ed sees this. he jumps up and frantically runs back in.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{where are you guys going?! you can't leave!}
<C>__{backer}
<P>__{(running out)}
<D>__{goodbye, mr. wood.}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(insane)}
<D>__{you can't go! you haven't seen the storyboards!}
