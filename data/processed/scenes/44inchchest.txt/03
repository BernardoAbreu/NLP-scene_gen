<A>__{music... `without you' by nilsson... we are out of focus on purple... white... scattered sparkling "jewels"? begin to come into focus and we see that they are in fact pieces of broken glass... thousands of splinters and shards strewn across a purple wilton carpet... the white fur of a luxurious sheepskin rug in bits... ripped to shreds... in extreme c u we begin to move along the floor slowly taking in mor e de bri s of d est ru ct io n... sm as he d c ha ir s... sm as he d photographs... broken records... ripped, shredded record sleeves `the power of love' by jennifer rush `hopelessly devoted to you' by olivia newton john `i will always love you' by whitney houston etc. the tv remote smashed to smithereens... the television widescreen totalled!... we move along the plush `world of leather' leather sofa... see that a chunk has been bitten out of it... see teeth marks like a bite out of cheese!... moving on past an area of slashed carpet and underfelt... approaching the legs of a si deboard and see ing into the bla ckness underneath... we can just make out the quizzical, frightened eyes of a white poodle... we move on... past twisted, wrecked lampshades... broken plates, ornaments... an up ended vase of half eaten flowers... nilsson continues his self pitying overwrought ballad and as he hits the massive, masochistic chorus crescendo we come across colin lying rigid on his back in the corner of the devastated room... his shocked eyes staring wildly... his body petrified. paralysed... as if frozen at the height of an epileptic fit like something from pompeii like max schrek as nosferatu hit by light... we stay on colin... his uncomprehending terror filled eyes... his sheer rigor mortis like horror... we move in on him... into the black of his eyes... the tragic, agonised black..}
