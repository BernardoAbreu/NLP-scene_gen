<L>__{interior sophie's warehouse moments later}
<A>__{daniel and sami are with the crew. they are not a happy bunch. wayne is smoking his joint, his eyes locked on the television.}
<C>__{julien}
<D>__{oh, man... this is bullshit! you can't trust anyone these days.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{she took everything! didn't even leave us cab fare.}
<A>__{a thought occurs to sami.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{not everything.}
<A>__{he removes the tape he put in the cassette deck last night before sophie entered.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{i was going to listen to it last night but i }
<A>__{he realizes it may not be the time to tell them what happened.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{ feel asleep.}
<A>__{wayne blurts out a sloppy laugh.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{no you didn't, dude. you were bangin' sophie. i saw you guys going at it.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{you slept with her?}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{well, actually i would say she slept with me.}
<A>__{daniel stares at him angrily.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{what's the big deal? it's not like i was on guard duty or something.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{you didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{no. chicks dig me.}
<A>__{daniel grabs the cassette and puts it in the player. on the tape we hear a phone ringing.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{zammito's voice}
<D>__{it's me. i need an answer from you if i'm going to move.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{we're not just talkin' about a 'piece of work' here. we're talking about a boss.}
<A>__{sami is the first to realize what he is hearing.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{sami holds his hand signaling them to be quiet so he can hear the rest.}
<C>__{zammito's voice}
<D>__{bonanno's a dinosaur. guy thinks he's fuckin' vito corleone or something. the old ways are gone. if we don't change now we're going to get pushed out. i need to know if i can count on your support?}
<A>__{a pause on the line.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{the line goes dead. sami leans back.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{no wonder zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. he's planning on killing bonanno and taking over the family.}
<C>__{julien}
<D>__{this wasn't the deal! the deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a mafia war.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{the deal is whatever mr. bastaldi says it is.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{you know, if you could get your nose out of bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.}
<C>__{julien}
<D>__{i knew this was a mistake! i knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. i could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! don't you do it!" jesus, why don't i ever listen to myself?}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{yeah, but you did do it. so let's deal with that.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{what are you guys so scared of? zammito doesn't know who we are. we just get out of town and it's over.}
<C>__{zero}
<D>__{oh, you think it's that easy?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{yeah. we just go home.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{we can't.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{i agree with marcel. i say we go to the airport and get on a plane.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{they'll be waiting for us at the airport.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{you steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. but these tapes. he's never going to stop looking for us.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{we have to find sophie.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{how are we going to do that?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i know where she went.}
<A>__{they all look over at him as he takes a huge hit off his jointerior}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i heard her talking on the phone. bay view motel. it's about five blocks from here.}
