<L>__{exterior highway shoulder night.}
<A>__{april stands in the dark 30 yards from the road looking over an expansive countryside. there's only a few lights in the distance. this is still farmland. frank comes up behind her, careful to keep his distance.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing? come back to the car.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{no. just let me stand here a second.}
<A>__{frank raises his arms in exasperation. a car approaches. he puts a hand in his pocket and tries to look casual. the car's headlights light up april's back, then pass.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{april?}
<A>__{she doesn't move.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{look, can't we sit in the car and talk about it, instead of running all over route twelve?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{haven't i made it clear i don't particularly want to talk about it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay. jesus, i'm trying to be nice about this thing.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{how kind of you. how terribly, terribly kind of you.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{wait a minute. i don't deserve this.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{you're always so wonderfully definite, aren't you, on the subject of what you do and don't deserve?}
<A>__{she turns and walks past him back towards the car.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{wait a minute!}
<A>__{he stumbles after her. other cars whizz by, but he's past caring.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{wait a minute, god damn it!}
<A>__{she leans against the car and folds her arms.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{you listen to me. this is one time you're not going to get away with twisting everything i say.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{christ, i wish you'd stayed home tonight!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you know what you are when you're like this? you're sick. i really mean that. you're sick!}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{and you know what you are?}
<P>__{(eyes raking him)}
<D>__{you're disgusting.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh, yeah?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{just because you've got me safely in this little trap, you think you can bully me into feeling whatever you want!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you in a trap! you in a trap! jesus, don't make me laugh!}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{yes, me.}
<P>__{(clutching at her chest)}
<D>__{me! me! me! oh, you poor, pathetic little boy look at you! look at you, and tell me how by any stretch of the imagination you can call yourself a man!}
<A>__{he raises his fist, she flinches away, and bong! bong! bong! bong! he punches the hood of the car. then, silence. the look april gives him is probably the worst look he's ever received: a look of pitying boredom.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't look at me like that, april.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{could we please go home now?}
<A>__{she calmly walks around and gets in the car. after a moment, frank follows...}
