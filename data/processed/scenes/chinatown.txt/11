<A>__{move along the red tiled roof and down to a lower level of the roof where gittes' feet are hooked over the apex of the roof and gittes himself is stretched face downward on the tiles, pointing himself and his camera to a veranda below him where the girl and mulwray are eating. gittes is clicking off more shots when the tiles his feet are hooked over come loose. gittes begins a slow slide down the tile to the edge of the roof and possibly over it to a three story drop. he tries to slow himself down. the loose tile also begins to slide. gittes stops himself at the roof's edge by the storm drain and begins a very precarious turn, this time hooking his feet in the drain itself. the loose tile falls and hits the veranda below. he stops as it's about to slide over the edge. he carefully lays it in the drain. but a fragment off the cracked edge of the tile falls.}

<A>__{the roof and the sign topping it betray nothing. he slowly sits back down, staring at the tile fragment. close shot newspaper "department of water and power blows fuse over chief's use of funds for el macando love nest." in the style of the hearst yellow press, there is a heart shaped drawing around one of the photos that gittes had taken. next to it is a smaller column, "j.j. gittes hired by suspicious spouse."}
