<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{well, i can.}
<A>__{she's about to call out. tom grabs her hard.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{if they know where the money is, they will kill us.}
<A>__{before karen can say anything, a flashlight beam comes swinging toward them and they have to duck underwater.}
<B>__{jim}
<A>__{watches as his flashlight beam washes over the car. nothing there. he guns his engine and heads off down the street.}
