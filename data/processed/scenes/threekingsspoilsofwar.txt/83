<L>__{exterior mesa early morning}
<A>__{the first light of day barely begins to fight its way through the dark. our boys sleep in a circle around the pack filled with gold. surprisingly they seem to sleep pretty well, but then the last twenty four hours has taken a lot out of them. there is a slight sound: rocks crunching underneath a foot. someone stirs, someone moves. it's hard to tell who it is in this bad light. they creep towards the pack, inching their way closer and closer. they reach out a hand, just about to grab the pack. wes, who obviously wasn't asleep at all, lunges for the person, and takes them down hard. there's the ugly crunch of body against stone as they hit the ground. m 16 in hand wes straddles the intruder pressing the muzzle of the rifle against his head.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{stay down. stay the hell down, or i will rip your stinking head off!}
<A>__{underneath him, an iraqi soldier who already looks very badly injured; bloody, cut, slightly burned babbles back in high pitched and frightened arabic. this is enough to wake jaeger and epps.}
<C>__{jager}
<D>__{what the hell?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i caught him! i caught him trying to steal the gold.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{get off him.}
<C>__{wes}
<P>__{(slightly crazed)}
<D>__{he snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only i wasn't sleeping. would have slit our throats if i hadn't stopped him.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{get off him!}
<A>__{epps reaches down and physically pulls wes from the soldier who still rattles on.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i told you. he tried to steal our gold. he tried to kill us.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{with what? he doesn't have a weapon.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{he's a soldier. he doesn't need a weapon. he's got rocks. he's got bare hands.}
<A>__{the soldier goes on babbling. wes has had just about enough of that. he gives the soldier a kick to the ribs.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{epps gives wes a hard push.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{stop it!}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i told you; don't push me around.}
<A>__{even now, frightened but more calmly, the soldier goes on.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{tell me what he's saying.}
<A>__{wes listens, but with disdain. he translates:}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{he lived through that?}
<A>__{the soldier goes on, and so does wes.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in saddam anyway. they flew the gunship up here to hide out. when they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{why'd he come in our camp.}
<A>__{wes asks him the question in arabic and gets an answer. it's enough to give wes a bit of a laugh.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{says he wanted food. liar. he wanted the gold.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{how's he going to want the gold? he couldn't even know we had it.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{he...he could have been watching us.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{maybe we should give him some water.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{all last night he could have been }
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i think he wants something to drink.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i'm not wasting my water on him.}
<A>__{jaeger gets his water and gives some to the soldier.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i don't care what he says, he wanted our gold. would have slit our throats if he had the chance.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{doesn't matter. whatever he wanted he didn't get it. we've got no need staying around here. it's light enough. let's pack up and head out.}
<A>__{jaeger and epps start to go for their gear. wes is still on the iraqi soldier.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what about him? we...we have to do something.}
<A>__{epps gives an expression that screams: what the hell are you talking about?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{we can't just leave him. he'll run back to his outfit, report our position...}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you said he was a deserter.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{that's what he says. he could be a spy, or something.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you don't know that.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you don't know he isn't.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{so we'll take him with us. at least 'til we get back to the hummer.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{he'd just slow us down, and drink our water. and if we ran into any more iraqis you know he'd sell us out.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we don't leave him, we don't take him with us. what does that leave?}
<A>__{by way of answering wes lifts his m 16 and works the action.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you're out of your mind.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{he's an enemy soldier.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i'm not going to let you kill him.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{we're at war.}
<A>__{the discussion starts to get real heated.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we are not at war! you and i and jaeger are awol. we have no authority }
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{he tried to kill us. if not just now, then in the helicopter. that's all the authority i need.}
<A>__{jaeger goes somewhere near panic.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{we don't need to do this. we got the gold, all right? let's just get out of here.}
<A>__{the iraqi may not speak the language, but he's got a pretty good idea what they are arguing about. he starts to plead for his life}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around. i have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i've got no stomach for murder.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{it's a combat action.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's murder, and i won't be any part of it.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{then step aside.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{get out of my way.}
<A>__{the iraqis begging goes into over drive. jaeger just about loses it.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{for christ's sake, we don't need this. let's just go. let's just...let's just get out of here.}
<A>__{wes yells down at the iraqi.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{shut up! shut the hell up!}
<A>__{wes moves menacingly for the iraqi. he thrusts his m 16 forward. epps grabs it, and throws a punch. unlike before with jaeger, this time wes ducks the blow and swings the butt of the m 16 back at epps. it's not much of a blow though, and epps keeps on coming. he barrels into wes and takes him down. as the two men tussle the iraqi sees his chance to get away. he springs up, knocking jaeger to the side, and bolts past him.}
<C>__{jager}
<D>__{he's getting away!}
<A>__{epps turns and sees this. maybe he's not for killing this guy, but he certainly can't just let him get away. he takes off running after the iraqi, jaeger a step behind. the iraqi, face flush with fear; eyes filled with terror like a hunted animal, makes it to the rock face and starts to climb to the plateau above. he knows if he can make it he at least has a chance of getting away. it shows in the desperation he climbs with. epps and jaeger are right behind him. they claw at the rocks, but can't gain ground. the iraqi gets closer and closer to the plateau; to freedom. our two soldiers scramble up right behind him. the iraqi gets a hand on the lip of the plateau. he's just about to pull himself up. he's just about to get away we hear a short burst of gunfire. three large, bloody holes mushroom open in the iraqi's back.}
