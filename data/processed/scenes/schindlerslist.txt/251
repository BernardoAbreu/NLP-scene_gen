<L>__{interior brinnlitz factory night}
<A>__{all twelve hundred workers and all the guards are gathered for the first time on the factory floor. tension and uncertainty surround them. it's ominously quiet. then }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{the unconditional surrender of germany has just been announced. at midnight tonight the war is over.}
<A>__{it is not his intention to elicit celebration. indeed, his words, echoing and fading in the factory, echo the doubts they all feel.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{tomorrow, you'll begin the process of looking for survivors of your families. in many cases you won't find them. after six long years of murder, victims are being mourned throughout the world.}
<A>__{not by untersturmfuhrer liepold. he stands with his men, dying to lift his rifle and fire.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{we've survived. some of you have come up to me and thanked me. thank yourselves. thank your fearless stern, and others among you, who, worrying about you, have faced death every moment.}
<P>__{(glancing away)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he's looking at the guards, thanking them, which thoroughly confuses the workers. just when they thought they knew where his sentiments lay, he's thanking guards.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you've shown extraordinary discipline. you've behaved humanely here. you should be proud.}
<A>__{or is he attempting to adjust reality, to destroy the ss as combatants, to alter the self image of both the guards and the prisoners? moving across the ss men's faces, they remain inscrutable. schindler turns his attention back to the workers, and, not at all like a confession, but rather like simple statements of fact:}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i'm a member of the nazi party. i'm a munitions manufacturer. i'm a profiteer of slave labor, i'm a criminal. at midnight, you will be free and i will be hunted.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i will remain with you until five minutes after midnight after which time, and i hope you'll forgive me, i have to flee.}
<A>__{that worries the workers. whenever he leaves, something terrible always seems to happen.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{in memory of the countless victims among your people, i ask us to observe three minutes of silence.}
<A>__{in the quiet, in the silence, drifting slowly across the faces of the workers the elderly, the lame, teenagers, wives beside husbands, children beside their parents, families together it becomes clear, if it wasn't before, that both as a prison and a manufacturing enterprise, the brinnlitz camp has been one long sustained confidence game. schindler has never stood still so long in his life. he does now, though, framed by his giant hilo machines, silent at the close of the noisiest of wars, his head bowed, mourning the many dead. when he finally does look up he sees that he is the last to do so. the faces, few of which he recognizes, are all looking at him. he turns to speak to the guards along the wall again.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i know you've received orders from our commandant which he has received from his superiors to dispose of the population of this camp.}
<A>__{apprehension spreads across the factory like a wave. pfefferberg tightens his grip on the pistol under his coat. his ragtag irregulars do the same, the rest of their ersatz "arsenal" concealed behind a machine. to the guards:}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{now would be the time to do it. they're all here. this is your opportunity.}
<A>__{the guards hold their weapons, as they have from the moment they arrived here tonight, at attention, waiting it seems, to be given the official order from their commander, liepold, who appears ready to give it.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{or...}
<P>__{(he shrugs)}
<D>__{...you could leave. and return to your families as men instead of murderers.}
<A>__{long, long silence. finally, one of the guards slowly lowers his rifle, breaks ranks and walks away. then another. and another. and another. another. when the last is gone, the workers consider liepold. he appears more an oddity than a threat. he is more an oddity than a threat. and he knows it. he turns and leaves.}
