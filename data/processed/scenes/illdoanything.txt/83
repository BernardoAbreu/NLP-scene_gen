<A>__{jeannie, a script in her lap, caressing it, avoiding her father's gaze. he sits nearby sizing her up, pissed.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i'm doing it.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{not if i don't let you. that's the law, the police law.}
<A>__{she takes this shot hard, but tries to pretend otherwise, continuing to stare hard at her script to avoid him.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{do i have to learn to read to be on television?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(with a real edge)}
<D>__{you're going to have to learn to look at me and listen to me and the longer i have to wait the angrier i'm going to be.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(looks up suddenly)}
<D>__{i'm so mad.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{me too. just listen.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i don't... why?!?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{because i know about this. i have worked with kid actors... they don't have that much fun. they're inside all day... they don't get to go to regular schools or play with their regular friends like ricky and essa.}
<P>__{(progressively losing it)}
<D>__{and their parents? you think i'm going to be one of those parents, sitting in one of those rooms, where we all go crazy trying to jump start our egos with our kids' sweat, all the time smiling at each other like our lives are working while we root against everyone else's little girl?}
<P>__{(jeannie is totally confused, until)}
<D>__{no!! no way! i can't!}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{okay. so, no, you're cuckoo anyway. i won't do it. and i don't care because i'm be stupid at it anyway.}
<A>__{she throws the script down. tears in her eyes.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{pick it up, jeannie.}
<A>__{she's so down, she complies picking it up and walking it to the trash can. matt stops her and takes the script.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{let's work on it.}
