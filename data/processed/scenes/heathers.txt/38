<L>__{interior the kelly kitchen day}
<A>__{kurt hangs up with an amazed expression on his face.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{women.}
<A>__{veronica's bedroom veronica and j.d. load guns on veronica's bed. veronica breaks into a laugh.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{get crucial. we won't be using blanks this time.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you can't be serious? hey listen, my bonnie and clyde days are over.}
<A>__{veronica drops her gun in revulsion and launches off her bed. with a patient smile, j.d. pulls her back down.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{do you take german?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{french.}
<A>__{j.d. flicks open his gun and pulls a bullet from the chamber.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{these are ich luge bullets. my grandfather snared a shitload of them in w.w. two. they're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{so it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.}
<A>__{j.d. nods then stands to pace the room, his mind whirring.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{we shoot kurt and ram. make it look like they shot each other. by the time kurt and ram regain consciousness, they'll be the laughingstock's of the school. the note's the punchline. how'd it turn out?}
<A>__{veronica clumsily extracts the note from her purse. she also plucks out the crumpled yellow sample of kurt's handwriting of the opening note forge scene. she proudly displays both papers.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{first tell me this similarity is not incredible.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<P>__{(warmly)}
<D>__{incredible similarity.}
<A>__{veronica pulls back the note and reads.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{ram and i died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. the joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. yet we were forced to live the lie of sexist beer guzzling jock asshole.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{exquisite, but i don't think ununderstanding is a word.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{we don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. why would the germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? i mean it was world war two, not a school play.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<P>__{(rapid fire)}
<D>__{they used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{neat. let's try it out on j.f.k.}
<A>__{veronica swiftly picks up her gun and aims it at the lovable tabby entering the room. j.d. rips it away from her.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{it doesn't work on small animals!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts i dug up. now, prepare to be a little disappointed.}
<A>__{j.d. lifts up a feminine shopping bag and gently dumps the contents on the bed.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{we've got a playgirl, a candy dish, a joan crawford post card, and lipstick.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you must have had fun.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you know it. oh man, i almost forgot. the one perfecto thing i picked up...}
<A>__{j.d. reaches in both his coat pockets and triumphantly raises out two bottles of perrier water.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{perrier water!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{oh come on . lots of people drink perrier. it's come a long way.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{this is ohio. if you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(mock seductively)}
<D>__{oh, you're so smart. how about a little heterosexuality before we go?}
<A>__{j.d. laughs then climbs onto veronica for a hugging kiss.}
