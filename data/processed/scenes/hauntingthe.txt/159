<A>__{marrow and theo look at him. it's what they've been thinking, but haven't had the courage to say. theo stops suddenly. turns around. the men notice, and pause. then they hear it. fainterior floating down from upstairs somewhere. nell's tune. it doesn't sound right, but it's hard to tell as it's coming from so far away. they look at each other, start for the stairs.}
