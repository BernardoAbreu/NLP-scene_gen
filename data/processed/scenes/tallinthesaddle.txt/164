<A>__{the wagon moving slowly through the cottonwoods, along the drive not far from the house. it stops now, and the camera moves closer to get dave and rocklin as they leave the team and start stealthily toward the house seen in the moonlight in the b.g.}
<L>__{interior clara's bedroom caldwell house dawn}
<A>__{we pick up clara in the act of nervously pinning on her hat in the dim light of a small lamp. she is fully dressed, and once the hat is on, she looks around anxiously for her top coat which she finds in the closet. she takes the coat and starts hurriedly toward the lamp, sitting on a small taboret near the door. as she bends over to blow it out, her eyes raise and she freezes.}
<B>__{miss martin has just opened the door and stands there staring icily for a long moment}
<A>__{now she snaps the door closed without removing her eyes from clara, and starts forward. the camera pulls back to include the two. clara stands as one under an hypnotic spell.}
<C>__{miss martin}
<P>__{(in a very low tone)}
<D>__{you vile, ungrateful strumpet running away in the night, like a deceitful sneak thief }
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(unrestrained)}
<D>__{yes i'm running away and it's all your fault you're the one who's been deceitful and sneaking and don't think i don't know what you intend doing.}
<C>__{miss martin}
<P>__{(very controlled)}
<D>__{ and don't think i don't know what you intend doing.}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(crying, as she moves away)}
<D>__{i don't care i'm not ashamed of it and nothing you can say or do is going to stop me.}
<C>__{miss martin}
<P>__{(hardly above a whisper)}
<D>__{you little fool if you go to garden city with that man you stand to lose everything.}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(stops pacing)}
<D>__{but why? why are you being so secretive? if you know something, why don't you tell me?}
<B>__{on dave and rocklin at the window listening}
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(nods and mumbles to himself)}
<D>__{yeah why don't you? }
<A>__{rocklin quickly shushes dave.}
<B>__{on miss martin and clara}
<C>__{miss martin}
<P>__{(unmindful of the presence of the men)}
<D>__{all right, i will tell you rocklin is a nephew of the late mr. caldwell. and, as nearest of kin, he stands to get everything according to the will. because you are not the old man's niece, but only his grand niece.}
<A>__{dave and rocklin at the window listening rocklin soberly dave wild eyed}
<C>__{miss martin's voice}
<D>__{rocklin turned up unexpectedly }

<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{if dave keeps quiet any longer he'll burst. he spins rocklin around and speaks in his natural voice.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{ and you knew the truth all the time, too didn't you? no wonder you stuck around }
<A>__{from rocklin's expression it is quite apparent to dave that he is right.}
<B>__{clara and miss martin}
<A>__{both women are staring dumbly toward the window. now the realization that she has been overheard staggers miss martin. she utters a stifled scream and, seeing rocklin starting through the window, runs from the room. rocklin just inside the room turns to dave}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{get in here and take care of her.}
<A>__{dave scrambles through the window and hurries in pursuit of miss martin. rocklin is at clara's side.}
