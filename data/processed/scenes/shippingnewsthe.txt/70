<L>__{interior bedroom late night}
<A>__{dim light. quoyle stirs beneath the billowing down coverlet. his eyes flutter. open. where...?}
<P>__{voice (o.s., very soft)}
<D>__{it's all right. you're in heaven.}
<A>__{his head snaps around. she's sitting just beside the bed in half shadow. her oxblood knitting across her lap.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{actually. it's just my bed.}
<A>__{now he sees the cigarette.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{actually, it's not. i just wanted to see your eyes bug out like that.}
<A>__{now he sees the smile.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you don't smoke.}
<A>__{his voice was a croak. so he clears his throat with a massive and disgusting effort. it is gross and funny, and she smiles again.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{only when i'm worried. i don't worry much.}
<A>__{he rolls over, to see her better. they are very close.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you don't have to, i'm all right. i'm in heaven.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{i'm not worried. about you.}
<A>__{oh. as he draws a breath to ask...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{you're in the boys' room at jack's house. wonder how long since dennis slept here.}
<A>__{she glances to the nightstand. beneath the dim lamp. a picture of jack and blond son jesson. guess what they're doing.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{mrs. buggit called, knew bunny was still with me. the kids are camped out in the parlor.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{nice. you sittin' up with me.}
<A>__{a longer one.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{s'okay. someday you'll do somethin' nice for me.}
<A>__{he nods. he will.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{who you worried ab...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{you didn't find a second dead man. just the rest of the first one.}
<A>__{ah. he nods. well, that figures.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{i asked. who you worried about?}
<A>__{on this, she stubs out her cigarette. takes another from the pack.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{you said bunny talks to petal at night. you ever listen?}
<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{not really. wouldn't be right.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{well, i'm not that nice a person.}
<A>__{strikes a match.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{she plays petal. talks to the barbies, like petal talking to her.}
<A>__{brings her cigarette. to the flame.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{she says she's sorry she left them. it was just to see if they could be good girls. and they were...}
<A>__{and.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{...and she loves them.}
<A>__{his eyes at once rapt and suffering. she watches that.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{the barbies look better naked, bunny looks good in blue, guess who said that?}
<A>__{draws on her smoke.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{so we talked. just before petal left her with that...stranger? bunny had snapped her mom's bead necklace. that's why she's making more.}
<A>__{do you understand?}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{when she's made enough. she'll be forgiven.}
<A>__{tears are pooling in his eyes. hers, too. she keeps going...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{she saves petal a room at the house, but she's also got the key to the old place. in case her mom would rather go there.}
<A>__{a thin stream of air escapes from his lips.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{and she talked about it. just like that.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{sure, i lied. i said nice things about her mother.}
<A>__{bitter smile.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{see, there's only one problem. petal isn't gone.}
<A>__{quoyle thinking. madly. what can he do?}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{so we're patient. and we wait, and we're good to her.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and. maybe. time.}
<A>__{she stares back. unease to match his own. maybe time.}
