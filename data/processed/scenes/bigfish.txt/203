<L>__{interior hospital room night}
<A>__{will sits in a chair beside the bed, working through the crossword puzzle. a knock as dr. bennett enters with his overcoat and bag, ready to leave for the night.}
<C>__{dr. bennett}
<D>__{glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. it's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{my father and i have an advantage. we never talk.}
<A>__{dr. bennett smiles as he checks edward's chart.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{how long have you known my father?}
<C>__{dr. bennett}
<D>__{thirty years. maybe more.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{how would you describe him?}
<C>__{dr. bennett}
<P>__{(re: chart)}
<D>__{five eleven. one eighty. regulated hypertension.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how would his son describe him?}
<A>__{tables turned, will searches for an answer. he doesn't have one. dr. bennett hangs the chart back on the bed.}
<C>__{dr. bennett}
<D>__{did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{a thousand times. he caught an uncatchable fish.}
<C>__{dr. bennett}
<D>__{not that one. the real story. did he ever tell you that?}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(suddenly interested)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{dr. bennett}
<D>__{your mother came in about three in the afternoon. her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in wichita. you were born a week early, but there were no complications. it was a perfect delivery. now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so i can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. and that's the real story of how you were born.}
<A>__{a long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors being paged.}
<C>__{dr. bennett}
<D>__{not very exciting, is it? and i suppose if i had to choose between the true version and an elaborate one involving a fish and a wedding ring, i might choose the fancy version. but that's just me.}
<A>__{will half smiles. patting will's shoulder, dr. bennett leaves. we stay on will and his father for a long time, then will takes his pen and starts making a list.}
