<L>__{exterior old farmhouse night}
<A>__{the last remnant of the once proud vanderholt holdings. grace pulls open a large garage door. assaulted by rain and sleet. she slips on the ice. regains her feet, finishes opening the door. she gets back in her truck and parks it inside the garage.}
<L>__{interior old farmhouse day}
<A>__{restored. filled with family heirlooms. another family that has decayed from glory. grace enters. dripping wet. she turns off the alarm. then hangs up her heavy jacket. bone tired. grace crosses to the kitchen.}
