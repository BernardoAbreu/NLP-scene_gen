<A>__{a pleasant bedroom, and safe no sharp objects or primary colors in sight, discreet decorative bars on the window. david, in pajamas, sits in a chair, eating bland food from a plastic lunch tray. he watches a golf match on a tiny watchman tv, we'll hear it in bg clapping, etc. he doesn't react as schuyler enters, moves to his side.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{david...}
<A>__{david turns to him, half smiles; food particles on his lips.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hello sky...}
<A>__{schuyler sits close to david, upset.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{sorry, i was just eating... i'm much better. really.}
<A>__{david does seem in control now, if a little hazy.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{thank god... listen, i know you put them onto me but i understand, we're both victims of this thing... they've stolen everything we ever had, they're trying to drive us both crazy but we won't let them. we'll find a way. there's gotta be a way to beat these bastards! we're in it together...}
<A>__{he clutches his brother's hand. david narrows his eyes, confused.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{in what together?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{the game.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh, schuyler, there is no game. it was just a fantasy of mine, a self aggrandizing delusion... i can't believe you took that shit seriously.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<P>__{(clutching his hand)}
<D>__{no, david please...}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(pulling away)}
<D>__{oh, man, stop fucking with me! you know the game doesn't exist... it never did! it never did...}
<A>__{schuyler stares at him for a beat no getting through. david leans forward, turns up the tv volume, aiming the set at schuyler.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{can you see?}
<A>__{on screen a golf ball rolls on a green and plops into the cup.}
