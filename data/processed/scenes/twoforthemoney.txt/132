<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{what's with the money, walter?}
<C>__{walter}
<L>__{1 for fucking 8!}
<A>__{(coming around the desk) i have a plan. from now on we take your picks and reverse everything! like a twilight zone episode where everything's the opposite! you say black we go white! a is b! lose becomes win!}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{(staring at the pile of cash) how much is that?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{(sweeping the pile to the floor) how much is what? oh, that 275,000 dollars!}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{what happened to the two mill, all the other money?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i was carrying twice that in red ink before you showed up. the last few weeks i thought keep the pressure off. he'll come around. climb out on his own. now i figure fuck it! time to turn on the lights! let him see the toilet he's drowning us all in! maybe that'll shake him up! so what do you want to know? i got three mortgages on this house, i'm gambling again and to cover my losses i just got a loan from a guy who works out of a bar on a 106th and broadway! all this everything you see around you is smoke and mirrors! i shoulda been a magician!}
<C>__{walter con'd}
<A>__{... what'd you say when you came in? you were in a good mood when you walked through the door and you said something.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{you're betting my picks?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{you went 82 and 11! you were picking 80 percent how could i fucking not!? trouble is i bet heavy after you went a hundred percent and rode you right into the fucking toilet! one decent weekend and i would have been set for life! one decent weekend! brandon stares at him, stunned.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{"i know what the problem is!" that's it! you came in with a big smile and said, "i know what the problem is!"}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{... i'm brandon lang, walter. brandon's the one who played sports. brandon's the one who can pick games. i lost touch with him myself. it wasn't an act, man. i became john anthony. but he's not me. if i go back to being brandon }
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{ you can pick again! of course! all you gotta do is go back to being brandon! talk like brandon! eat like brandon! forget john anthony! burn the suits! it's all my fault. i see that now. i pushed you into something you weren't. i took the golden goose and tried to turn it into a duck. we're winding down the season. there's only two games this weekend. two winners and two over unders. that's all we need. you crunch the numbers, sprinkle in a little brandon magic, we get the sales people burning up the phones and come monday we go four for four going into the big game! right? huh? let's get something to eat! go to smith and wo's!}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{no thanks. i will stay here. eat light.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{(kneeling down, stacking the cash) the brandon thing! what am i thinking trying to get you to go out? what would brandon eat for lunch? peanut butter and jelly? ramen noodles? what?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{(on the floor, helping him) i will get something.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{you want anything shipped from home? your bed? clothes? porno collection?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{no, i'm fine.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{blow job?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{thanks anyway. maybe later...}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{because it's important.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{pressure doesn't help.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{god forgive me, you're an artist. i fucked with that. two little winners and a couple of over unders. that's all we need. you could phone it in. two's nothing. not for you. not for brandon. right, brandon? isn't that right? brandon stands. looks down at walter, unable to hide the desperation behind his frozen smile and montage of brandon working through the week brandon closes the blinds in his office, blocks the view brandon works out, watching espn the sales staff sit idle at their desks, playing cards a pick sheet fills frame, shows new york versus atlanta, tenessee versus kansas city and an over under beneath each game walter waits in the sales room, edgy, pacing when brandon emerges holding the sheet all eyes on him walter approaches }
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{these are the winners?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{that's who i like.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{brandon made these picks?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{you're looking at him.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{(regarding the picks, to the room) new york and the under, tenessee and the under! sell 'em hard!}
