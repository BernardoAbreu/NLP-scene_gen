<L>__{interior empty apartment night}
<A>__{the gun continues to fire as corky clutches the phone, whispering.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{this is an emergency!}
<L>__{interior caesar's apartment night}
<A>__{crunched down behind the bar, violet listens to the only sound, repeating in the unnatural quiet: click. click. click. rising, she peers over the edge of the bar. caesar is standing in the aftermath. his gun is still aimed at johnnie as he pulls the trigger over and over. the bodies are still, blood silently pooling around them. blinking the sweat from his eyes, caesar sees violet.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i had to do it, violet. you saw it. i had no choice. it was johnnie. that lying fuck. he made me do it.}
<A>__{he looks down at jobnnie, hate rising like bile.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{you lying rat fuck. you think you can set me up? is that what you think? you stupid fuck.}
<A>__{kicking the body, be causes a series of sickening wet noises.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i'm a dead man? i'm a dead man? guess again, fuck face. who's dead? who's the dead lying rat fuck? take another guess, take another fucking guess!}
<A>__{he stops, panting, unable to catch his breath. violet is afraid to even look at him. blood creeps along the edge of the floorboards. caesar tries to clear his head, mopping the sweat from his face. he bends down and starts searching johnnie's pockets. he finds his keys.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{lost in thought, he goes to gino. throwing open the coat, he sees the airplane ticket. there is a bullet hole in it. he checks the times and then his watch.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{... maybe three hours.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar, what are you going to do?}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what do you think we're going to do? we have to find the money.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar, you just killed gino marzzone.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{no i didn't. not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here. then they never showed up.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{what happened to them?}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i don't know. we may never know, but i'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the karpoli family.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{all part of the business.}
<A>__{he picks up roy's gun and stuffs it in his belt.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{we just got to find the money. once we do, everything is going to be all right.}
<A>__{in the distance, the wail of a police siren can be heard.}
