<D>__{my favorite time, though, is lunch because i get to see sam and patrick. we spend the time working on mary elizabeth's fanzine about music and the rocky horror picture show. it's called punk rocky. mary elizabeth is really interesting because she is a buddhist and a punk, but somehow she always acts like my father at the end of a "long day."}
