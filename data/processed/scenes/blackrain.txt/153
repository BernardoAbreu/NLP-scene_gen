<A>__{nick steps out of the house. he now has one end of a wire coat hanger loosely wrapped around sugai's neck, the other end around his wrist. his gun is pressed just beneath sugai's ear. if nick gets shot, so does sugai. a handful of guards stand in the courtyard, one is polishing sugai's debonnaire car. they spot nick and sugai coming, and immediately pull their guns.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{explain to them. they shoot me, they kill you.}
<P>__{(sugai hesitates)}
<D>__{do it!}
<A>__{sugai explains to his lieutenants. they stand helpless as nick walks sugai toward the car.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{grab the keys, ich, and get inside.}
<C>__{ich}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{not now, man, okay, not now. work with me.}
<A>__{ich takes the keys from the man polishing the car. he gets inside. joyce hurries in bedside him.}
<C>__{ich}
<D>__{you don't know what you're doing.}
<A>__{nick slides sugai in the back seat, carefully reaches over and shuts the door.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{start it.}
<C>__{ich}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{i can't...}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{slide over.}
<A>__{joyce, furious at nick, starts the car, gets behind the wheel. ich gets in on the other side. she spins the car around. the gate opens. they tear off.}
