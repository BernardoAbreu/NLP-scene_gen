<L>__{interior '76 bmw 2002 day}
<A>__{behind the wheel is miss colleen van deusen, thirties, attractive, a progressive attitude. rennie wickham sits next to her she's seventeen, pretty, slightly withdrawn. rennie's dog toby, a border collie, rides in the back seat.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{i'm glad you decided to come after all.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{me too. but i'm not sure uncle charles will be.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{you let me worry about him, okay?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, rennie. you made the right decision.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{what about not so great writers?}
<A>__{rennie smiles self deprecatingly, miss van deusen grinning back. but rennie's smiles are few and far between, this one disappearing as she glances out the window. rennie's point of view (second unit) as the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread out before her, eery in the bog. a small rowboat grazes across it occupied by two indistinguishable people.}
<B>__{return to shot}
<A>__{rennie's eyes show a hidden terror. she quickly turns away, shivering briefly. miss van deusen notices. she turns a corner, heading into the parking lot.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{everything okay?}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{just felt a little chill.}
<A>__{rennie rubs her arms, faking coldness.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{did you know that i'm giving up teaching?}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{since the school is closing anyway, i'm going to write that novel i've been threatening on everybody.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{that's wonderful, miss van deusen...what's it about?}
<A>__{she parks the car, turning off the ignition.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{a senior class cruise to manhattan, laced with romance, adventure and murder.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{or a gothic cook book. i haven't decided which.}
<A>__{she's coaxed the smile out of rennie again. miss van deusen pulls a small wrapped box from her glove compartment, handing it to rennie, who seems utterly surprised.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{go on, open it.}
<A>__{rennie pops off the lid, revealing an antique ink dip pen.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{stephen king supposedly used it when he was in high school.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{i don't know what to say...}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{rennie, you're the best student i ever had...you have a real gift. if anybody can make use of that pen, it's you.}
<A>__{rennie hugs her teacher. camera rises above the car's window, finding a mercedes 560 sl pulling in a short distance away. closer angle mercedes a sexy, money dressed blonde is behind the wheel. tamara mason. she climbs from her leather seats as a trio of senior girls walk by, offering enthusiastic hi's and hellos. she's obviously miss popular. tamara crosses to a cute japanese girl unloading luggage from a beige honda,}
<B>__{eva watanabe.}
<D>__{. tamara are you ready for drugs, sex and rock 'n roll or what, girl?}
<A>__{eva gives her a warning glance, nodding to her left. eva's mother appears by the passenger door, forcing a smile at tamara.}
<C>__{mrs. watanabe}
<D>__{hello, tamara.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{hi, mrs. watanabe. just kidding.}
<C>__{mrs. watanabe}
<D>__{yes, i'm sure.}
<A>__{embarrassed, eva hurries to her mom, rushing a kiss goodbye.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{don't worry about a thing, mom. i will have a terrific time and i won't do anything stupid, okay?}
<A>__{before mrs. watanabe can squeeze a word in, her daughter is gone. she waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate.}
<C>__{mrs. watanabe}
<D>__{i love you...}
<B>__{tracking with tamara and eva}
<A>__{once they're out of mrs. watanabe's earshot }
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{i hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{i'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.}
<A>__{tamara unzips her purse, revealing a baggie filled with fine white powder. eva looks very nervous.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{it's my graduation gift from daddy. it cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{he bought you that?}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{more or less. it's part of my college fund.}
<A>__{she grins coquettishly, walking on. camera holds on the calm, foggy harbor...where the faint image of a houseboat is aimlessly drifting into port. closer angle houseboat sure enough, it's the same one we saw jason on last night...but no one is behind the helm. it seems to be a ghost ship.}
