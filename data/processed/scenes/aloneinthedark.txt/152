<L>__{interior underground lab 170}
<A>__{carnby, aline, barr, and burke step over the rubble of the concrete wall. they shine their lights around the dark room. they are in a large abandoned bureau 713 lab. thick dust covers all surfaces. but it was once a high tech facility. on one side of the lab is a sliding metal door.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{what is this place?}
<A>__{medical equipment, scientific instruments, and computers have been left as they were, untouched for two decades. a series of glass tubes are lined up along one wall. in each tube, a spinal worm lies dead, floating in gelatinous liquid aline checks out a series of diagrams affixed to another wall. they are anatomical schematics for the spinal worms. there are also diagrams of the human body with markings isolating key areas of the spinal cord. carnby stands in front of a row of twenty clear glass basins, each about the size of a child. each basin has a small metal tag on it. carnby wipes the layer of dust off one of the metal tags. the tag reads: e. carnby.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{this is where it happened.}
<A>__{aline steps up next to carnby.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{who did this to you?}
<A>__{burke and barr continue to explore the room with their rifle mounted lamps. barr finds a pair of huge metal hangar doors.}
<C>__{agent barr}
<D>__{commander...}
<A>__{carnby, burke, and aline approach barr at the hangar doors. next to the hangar doors is a control panel. barr pulls the front off the control panel, revealing a rusted hand crank. barr pulls on the hand crank. it won't give. carnby joins him and, together, they strain to move the hand crank. the hand crank clanks into the open position. an old mechanism is engaged. the hangar doors slide open, revealing another doorway behind them. but this one is clearly not part of the lab. it is an ancient, solid gold door, carved with abkani symbols. the gold door is built into a wall of rough rock. it looks like the lab was built right around the gold door. in the center of the door is a small cylindrical opening.}
<B>__{a}
<A>__{line uses her flashlight to read the symbols on the door. one symbol is prominent among the others: the dark spirit.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{edward, look...}
<A>__{aline reaches into her pack and takes out the abkani device. it is the exact size of the cylindrical opening in the door. the same dark spirit pictogram is engraved on the lynchpin.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{so it's a key.}
<A>__{burke surveys the room with a grim expression.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i say we got two options. one, we open this door, deal with whatever's on the other side.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{the pictograms carved here make it pretty clear that's a bad idea.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{two, we set enough c 4 to bury this place. keep whatever's in there, down here for good.}
<A>__{carnby stares at the gold door.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{the answers i've been looking for my whole life could be in there.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{some doors are locked for a reason.}
<A>__{carnby looks away from the gold door.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{barr... how much c 4 you got left?}
<A>__{barr pulls open his pack, revealing several packages of c 4.}
<C>__{agent barr}
<D>__{enough to blow this place to...}
<A>__{barr is cut off by a bullet hitting him in the head. blood spurts out as barr collapses to the ground, dead. hudgens stands behind them, carrying two pistols.}
<C>__{hudgens}
<D>__{i'm afraid i can't allow that.}
<A>__{before they can react, hudgens presses a pistol to aline's throat. he points the other pistol at burke and carnby.}
<C>__{hudgens }
<D>__{now drop your weapons and back away.}
<A>__{carnby and burke drop their guns and step back. carnby glares at hudgens.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{it was 713.}
<C>__{hudgens}
<D>__{our early work was crude, i admit. but eventually we perfected the implant process. you were our last failure, carnby. if you hadn't escaped, 713 never would've shut down the experiments.}
<A>__{burke's eyes flash with anger.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{there's no way this was sanctioned.}
<C>__{hudgens}
<D>__{before your kind took over, 713 had very different... priorities. now, you just blaze in and destroy everything before we can learn to control it. i've wasted twenty years working in secret because of short sighted men like you.}
<A>__{hudgens sees the abkani device aline is holding.}
<C>__{hudgens }
<D>__{there it is...}
<A>__{aline's expression is firm, unafraid. she grips the device tightly. hudgens is about to pull the trigger.}
<C>__{hudgens }
<D>__{you were a fine archeologist.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{aline...}
<A>__{hudgens turns to carnby, curious.}
<C>__{carnby }
<D>__{give him the key. enough people have died today.}
<A>__{aline sees carnby is serious. she holds out the device to hudgens.}
<C>__{hudgens}
<D>__{you couldn't have opened it anyway. not without this...}
<A>__{hudgens takes out the hollow cylinder artifact he found on the erebus. he hands it to aline. aline inserts the artifact into the hollow circular space at the bottom of the device, turning it into place. the device is now a full cylinder with a flat protrusion on the bottom. with one pistol pointed at burke and carnby and the other at aline, hudgens directs her to the gold door.}
<C>__{hudgens }
<D>__{insert the key.}
<B>__{a}
<A>__{line inserts the device into the opening in the door.}
<C>__{hudgens }
<D>__{now turn it.}
<A>__{aline rotates the device, using the flat protrusion on the bottom. it clicks into place. a small crack splinters away from the opening where the device sits. the crack splits off into several other cracks. hudgens points his pistols at the others, but his attention is clearly directed at the gold door.}
<C>__{hudgens }
<D>__{when we found the first of them, 713 saw just another threat to be eliminated. but i knew it was something more. it was the first. the first to wake. i've woken others since then. but the rest are coming...}
<A>__{as hudgens speaks, carnby, burke, and aline exchange a look between them. carnby's eyes indicate the c 4 in agent barr's pack. burke and aline understand. the cracks splinter out, dividing, until they cover the entire door. in a rush of fragments, the cracked gold crumbles to the ground. he empty doorway now leads into darkness on the other side. scenes 170b to 170d now scenes 119h to 119j}
