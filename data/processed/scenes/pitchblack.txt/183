<L>__{exterior canyon rim the gauntlet night}
<A>__{black screen. we hear the canyon in full cry now clicking... battling bone blades...mating cries...the rending of flesh and snapping of tendon. far below, twin flames appear as the survivors reach the gauntlet. predators perch in foreground, just hulking silhouettes "watching" from a canyon rim.}
<L>__{exterior start of gauntlet night}
<A>__{they are but five: fry, riddick, audrey, imam, and pilgrim #1. close on each face as they listen to the canyon. there must be countless predators ahead.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{how many you see?}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{one or two.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{audrey?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{three full bottles. but almost time to refill.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{only see one way. turn the sled over and drag it like that, girl down low. light up everything we got and run through like dogs on fire.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{imam}
<P>__{(understanding)}
<D>__{the sled as a shield....}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{and what about the cells?}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{i will take those.}
<A>__{she looks at him hard.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{we're just here to carry your light, aren't we? just the torch bearers.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{let's drop back an' boot up.}
