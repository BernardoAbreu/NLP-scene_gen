<A>__{we are tight on the sweating face of a man who looks like he's about to be executed.}
<T>__{cut back to:}
<B>__{stokes}
<A>__{is standing at the end of a long conference table as the network brass glares at him.}
<C>__{stokes}
<P>__{(addressing the brass)}
<D>__{gentlemen, let me be the first to say, in all sobriety, that i'm as shocked and outraged as all of }
<A>__{the network ceo, a hog of a man, cuts him off.}
<C>__{ceo}
<D>__{save it for the papers, stokes. we've got nervous sponsors and an angry public a combination uglier than two monkeys fucking. what are you doing about it?}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{well, sir, i'm currently in the process of compiling a list of viable replacements and it's my hope...}
<C>__{ceo}
<D>__{clean replacements? with background checks? i assure you, mr. stokes, this network cannot survive another rainbow randolph. the goddamn p.r. department looks like the jim jones camp.}
<A>__{another executive chimes in.}
<D>__{executive #1 remember, stokes, this was your dog that crapped on our rug. executive #2 we trusted you, frank. and now we're in a tight spot. we have to post our quarterly earnings next month, for christ's sake.}
<C>__{ceo}
<D>__{whoever takes that slot has to be a straight arrow. clean as a whistle. executive #3 right. someone who'll take the heat off. one of those sweater types. any chance of luring fred rogers away from p.b.s.? executive #4 yeah, if we back up the brinks truck. executive #1 no way. the idea now is to stop the hemorrhaging. executive #2 you better fix this, stokes. get us a white bread replacement, fast. bland, milk toast. not a speck of controversy.}
<A>__{a giant hand slams on the table. all heads snap. the ceo drags his fingers along the shiny mahogany. deafening sound.}
<C>__{ceo}
<P>__{(calm and measured)}
<D>__{squeaky fucking clean.}
