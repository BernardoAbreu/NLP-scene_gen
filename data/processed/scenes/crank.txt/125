<A>__{montage: chinatown is bustling with activity. vendors haggle ... workers hustle down the sidewalk with baskets of chickens, sides of meat ... tourists wander ... motorists argue and punch their horns ... and the lunch hour crowd converges on a hundred eateries ... we hear a million heartbeats, old, young ... even fast ticking chicken heartbeats, all overlapping, blending together in a swelling din of live things. the voyeuristic camera picks chev and eve up through the crowd. chev is wearing dark glasses to go with his 80’s hair and jogger.}
