<L>__{exterior street below low angle that moment}
<A>__{police pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead where the small, barely visible figure of a woman, clad entirely in black leather, is doing a tightrope walk across the intersection.}
<L>__{exterior rooftop a minute later night}
<A>__{the catwoman bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides she's out of danger. then, weary and exhilarated, she drops to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches, emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure. she's just made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped for a moment of quality time. she hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over. her whole body tenses and though her head doesn't move her eyes dart left. a caped shadow has just touched down at the end of a line. the gold bat emblem on his chest is visible for the briefest of seconds before he steps back into the shadows. she acts like she hasn't noticed... ...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same. tight on batman that moment his eyes widen his lips part as he watches her. if it's possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're seeing it now. his pov on catwoman that moment she still doesn't let on that she's seen him. instead, she goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to strut, like a gymnast on the balance beam posing for him in a little private show a strange, self infatuated, autoerotic dance routine for batman's benefit.}
