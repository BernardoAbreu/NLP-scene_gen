<A>__{oscar, now in the car by himself rides in the car listening to hip hop music. he comes to a red light. he looks at the car radio clock: 8:58 am. he thinks to himself for a beat, he looks dissatisfied. he turns his music up for a beat and listens to it. he looks around, still not at ease. he turns off his music and pulls out his cellphone. he takes a quick look around to see what cars are around, before dialing numbers. calling mom flashes on the screen. he holds the phone to his ear.}
