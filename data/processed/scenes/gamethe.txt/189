<A>__{all seems quiet, the house dark late at night. there's a movement in the bushes near the street schuyler emerges, on the lookout for any surveillance. it seems safe. he digs out a hidden key from within a fake rock then goes to the front door, gathers up newspapers and a thick stack of mail from his box. he flips through it quickly, finds a postcard that interests him and shoves it in his pocket the rest of the mail he leaves in the box. he punches in his code on the alarm pad, unlocks the door and enters. close on alarm pad the light goes from green to red.}
