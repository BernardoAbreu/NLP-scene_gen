<D>__{...this was during the los angeles marijuana drought of '86. i still had a connection. which was insane, 'cause you couldn't get weed anyfuckinwhere then. anyway, i had a connection with this hippie chick up in santa cruz. all and my friends knew it. and they'd give me a call and say, "hey, freddy, you buyin some, you think you could buy me some too?" they knew i smoked, so they'd ask me to buy a little for them when i was buyin. but it got to be everytime i bought some weed, i was buyin for four or five different people. finally i said, "fuck this shit." i'm makin this bitch rich. she didn't have to do jack shit, she never even had to meet these people. i was fuckin doin all the work. so i got together with her and told her, "hey, i'm sick of this shit. i'm comin through for everybody, and nobody's comin through for me. so, either i'm gonna tell all my friends to find their own source, or you give me a bunch of weed, i will sell it to them, give you the money, minus ten percent, and i get my pot for free." so, i did if for awhile...}
