<L>__{exterior tent city night}
<A>__{we see the roman encampment, a sea of tents. hundreds of campfires burn before the tents.}
<L>__{interior hospital tent night}
<A>__{maximus enters a large tent and is met by a spectacle of the dead and dying. roman surgeons are working feverishly to save lives. limbs are amputated, the bloody stumps quickly cauterized with hot irons. leeches and bronze cups are employed for blood letting to balance "humours." anesthesia as we know it is nonexistent. wine amphoras are passed around and orderlies fan narcotic smoke toward the patients. mostly, though, they just hold down the writhing patients. maximus moves through the tent, offering a word of comfort here and there. all the wounded are delighted to see him. he goes to an older soldier, gallus, who has one wooden hand. his other hand is bandaged.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{what, gallus, losing your other hand?}
<C>__{gallus}
<D>__{aye, general, they're going to make a bronze one for it. long fingers this time.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{and the women of your village will crave your touch even more.}
<C>__{gallus}
<D>__{ah, then you know the women of my village.}
<A>__{maximus smiles and moves on. he stops at a young soldier, valerius, whose head has been shaved. a hole has been bored into his skull to relieve the pressure on his brain. the young soldier is dying.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{what's your name, son?}
<C>__{valerius}
<D>__{valerius, general.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{the name suits you.}
<C>__{valerius}
<D>__{why am i dying?}
<A>__{a beat. maximus sits by his cot. he takes valerius' hand.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{you're dying because you love rome, as i do.}
<C>__{valerius}
<D>__{i've never been to rome.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{neither have i. rome for us lives here...}
<P>__{(he touches his heart)}
<D>__{... it's a thing inside us that came from our ancestors and that we give to our children.}
<C>__{valerius}
<D>__{it must be glorious, rome. i've only seen pictures. is it a glorious place?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{yes, it's a glorious place.}
<C>__{valerius}
<D>__{it must be.}
<A>__{he smiles. and he is dead. maximus sits for a moment. he gently closes valerius' eyes. and maximus finds that he is weeping. he is not ashamed of the tears.}
