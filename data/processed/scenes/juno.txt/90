<L>__{interior loring house living room day}
<A>__{juno reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the front door, only to be intercepted by vanessa, who's returning home from work, carrying her briefcase and a freshly purchased nursing pillow. they nearly collide.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{juno? what's going on?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{it's obvious from juno's tears and flushed face that she's lying. vanessa instantly goes pale with fear, but she tries her hardest to seem serene and "together" in front of juno.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<P>__{(pretending to be calm)}
<D>__{mark? why is juno crying?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i'm not crying. i'm allergic to fine home furnishings. see you later.}
<A>__{she rushes toward the door.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{hold on.}
<A>__{juno halts.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{juno, what's the matter?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{she's hormonal. right, june? it's just part of the whole process.}
<A>__{juno looks totally betrayed. she doesn't respond. vanessa looks at juno's expression and knows mark is lying.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i didn't do anything... i just... i've just been thinking.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<P>__{(you've been thinking?)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{what are you referring to?}
<A>__{she knows exactly to what he's referring.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{of course we're ready. we've taken all the classes. the nursery. the books }
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i know we're prepared. i just don't know if... i'm ready.}
<A>__{juno's face continues to fall. vanessa notices.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<P>__{(to juno)}
<D>__{juno, don't worry about this. he just has cold feet. that's how boys are. the books all say the same thing. a woman becomes a mother when she gets pregnant. a man becomes a father when he sees his baby. he's going to get there. he'll get there.}
<A>__{juno ain't buying it.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<P>__{(to mark)}
<D>__{why don't we let juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it all just happened so fast. we put that ad in the paper. i thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then boom two weeks later, she's in our living room.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{she answered our prayers.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(ignores the comment)}
<D>__{ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.}
<A>__{this stops vanessa. juno looks offended.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<A>__{a long hideous beat.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it just feels a little like bad timing.}
<A>__{another hideous beat.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{what would be a good time for you?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't know. there's just things i still want to do.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{like what? be a rock star?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{don't mock me.}
<A>__{vanessa sighs. it's done.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{you're trying to do something that's never going to happen. and you know what? your shirt is stupid. grow up. if i have to wait for you to become kurt cobain, i'm never going to be a mother.}
<A>__{vanessa looks defeated.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i never said i'd be a great father.}
<A>__{we hear the front door closing. vanessa and mark look over and notice that juno has escaped the conflict.}
