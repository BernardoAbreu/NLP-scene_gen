<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{captain pike sir, we have to stop ship!}
<C>__{pike mccoy}
<A>__{ mr. kirk! how the hell did you get on board the this man is under the enterprise?! influence of a severe reaction}
<D>__{to a vaccine. he is delusional and i take full responsibility for }
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{vulcan isn't experiencing a natural disaster, it's being attacked by romulans.}
<A>__{on the crew as that lands. but most specifically, spock.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{cadet kirk, i think you've had enough attention for one day dr. mccoy, return to medical, we'll have words later.}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{yessir.}
<A>__{rebuked, mccoy exits as:}
<C>__{spock kirk}
<A>__{as you know, mr. kirk is not cleared to be aboard this vessel. by starfleet yeah, i get it, you're a regulations, that makes him a great arguer, i'd love to do stowaway... it again with you, too. i can remove the cadet from try it! this cadet is the bridge, sir trying to save the bridge! by recommending a full stop in trans warp in the midst of a rescue mission? it's not a rescue mission }
<D>__{listen to me! it's an attack!}
<A>__{ based on what facts? on kirk. enough. and cadet or not, the bridge is his.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{fact: the same anomaly a lighting storm in space that we saw today also occurred on the day of my birth, before a romulan ship attacked the u.s.s. kelvin.}
<P>__{(to pike)}
<D>__{you know that, i read your dissertation. which was good.}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{fact: this ship which had formidable and advanced weaponry was never seen or heard from again fact: the kelvin attack took place on the edge of klingon space and at 11 hundred hours last night there was an escape from a klingon prison planet rura penthe fact: the escaped prisoners were romulans, sir, and it was reported that they stole a ship from the prison dock.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{and you know of this prison escape how?}
<A>__{kirk just points to uhura.}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{sir, i i intercepted and translated the message myself. kirk's report is accurate.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{we're warping into a trap there are romulans waiting for us, i promise you that.}
<A>__{all eyes on pike. he looks to spock, who could screw kirk here... but }
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{the cadet's logic is sound.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{and lieutenant uhura is unmatched in xenolinguistics, we would be wise to accept her conclusion.}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(to comm officer)}
<D>__{scan vulcan space, check if any transmissions are being made in romulan.}
<C>__{communications officer}
<D>__{sir, i'm not sure i could distinguish the romulan language from vulcan.}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(to uhura)}
<D>__{how about you you speak romulan, cadet...?}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{uhura, sir. all three dialects.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{uhura, relieve the lieutenant mr. hannity, hail the u.s.s. truman.}
<A>__{uhura sits at the console she puts on the earpiece. we've just watched the birth of an icon. she works the controls }
<C>__{hannity}
<D>__{the other ships are out of warp and have arrived at vulcan, sir but we seem to have lost all contact }
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{captain, i pick up no romulan transmissions or transmissions of any kind in the area. there seems to be something jamming all communication around vulcan.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{it's because they're being attacked. captain. please.}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(long, tense beat)}
<D>__{shields up. ready all weapons.}
<A>__{lights go red. hold on the faces of our people afraid, hearts pounding as they dread what they're about to see }
<C>__{sulu}
<D>__{arrival at vulcan in five seconds! four... three... two }
<A>__{suddenly, as the enterprise drops out of warp, the flaming hull of a starfleet ship comes barreling right at the bridge!}
<C>__{captain pike sulu}
<A>__{emergency evasive! on it, sir! sulu dips the enterprise fast and hard and the spinning debris just scars the ship. the bridge shakes, but rights itself. the crew sees the narada floating above the planet their eyes go wide at the monumental ship meanwhile, inside:}
