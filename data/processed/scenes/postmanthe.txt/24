<L>__{exterior plains day}
<A>__{rain as the army moves. boots suck at the mud. war wagons heave out of ruts. a monster gun is mounted on an old john deere semi, pulled by a team of ten horses. the conscripts fill the middle ranks, each bearing a heavy pack. marching beside woody, the postman stares blankly ahead. the cry to halt. the conscripts unsling their packs, catch their breath. idaho pulls the postman out of line.}
