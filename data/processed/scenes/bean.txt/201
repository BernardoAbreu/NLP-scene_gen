<A>__{a small storeroom where bean's wriggling bottom is just coming back through the window. he has the picture and is safe. he sets the picture down on a table. darn! the birds have done their business on it. he maniacally rummages through various dusty cans and bottles on a shelf. he chooses a can, too rusty to read its label, takes off the lid and sniffs. this smells like the right sort of stuff. he pours the liquid on to a rag and rubs it on the face of mrs. whistler. the solvent effortlessly removes the ink stain. whistler's mother looks as good as new. bean is so, so, relieved. but then he notices something else happening. the liquid did not stop with removing the stain. it is now busy removing whistler's mother's face entirely. as bean watches in frozen horror, america's most famous painting turns back to a blank canvas. bean thinks for a second and then has a desperate thought. removing the pen that started all the trouble, he decides to try to draw back on whistler's mother's 'face. he doesn't have much time. it shows. where once was a sublime oil painting, is now a biro line drawing which looks a little like danny de vito. bean lifts it against the wall to check how it's worked. unfortunately, there's a nail there. the picture tears, bean panics it tears even more. total destruction.}
