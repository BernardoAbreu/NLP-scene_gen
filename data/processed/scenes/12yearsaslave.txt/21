<T>__{we make a hard cut :}
<A>__{to solomon outside of the pub, in an alley, with brown and hamilton in silhouette, back lit by the street lights. he is violently ill, hunched over and retching horribly.}
<C>__{hamilton}
<D>__{that's all right solomon. no shame in it. no shame at all.}
<L>__{interior gadsby hotel staircase}
<A>__{hamilton and brown help solomon to lumber up the spiral staircase, passing the occasional bemused guest.}
<L>__{interior gadsby hotel solomon's room night}
<A>__{hamilton is placing a spittoon near solomon's bed, where a prone and reeling solomon lays. hamilton sits on the bed. as he strokes solomon's sweaty face, hamilton speaks sweetly.}
<C>__{hamilton}
<D>__{i'm afraid that brown and i haven't brought you much luck. but rough waters bring smooth sailing. eventually they do.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{....so...so sorry...}
<C>__{hamilton}
<D>__{shhh. we won't hear it. we won't.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{let him sleep.}
<C>__{hamilton}
<D>__{hmm. a good night's sleep. and tomorrow...tomorrow you will feel as well and refreshed as though the earth were new again.}
<A>__{hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to solomon for brown's taste. with more than a bit of signification:}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{hamilton! nothing more we can do for him.}
<C>__{hamilton}
<D>__{such is the pity.}
<A>__{displaying an odd sort of disappointment, hamilton slinks away from the bed. he crosses to, and blows out a candle. the room goes dark with a blackness more than night. brown and hamilton exit. solomon lays in the dark and moans. his sounds becoming more and more}
<B>__{distressed.}
