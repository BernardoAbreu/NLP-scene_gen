<L>__{exterior campus concession area day}
<A>__{joan and helen, seated at a table near the concessionary building. the latter sits, tense and disturbed, an uneaten sandwich in front of her, as helen reads from a list of suspects. (lewie can be seen at another table, seated across from a bearded man. the other members of the chorale, including the male soloists, are variously seated, moving about, or lounging on the campus lawn, having their lunch.)}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{'lewie. mad at me.'}
<A>__{the camera peruses lewie.}
<D>__{helen (o.s.) (cont'd) doesn't want a divorce. maybe he's trying to scare me, or punish me.}
<A>__{helen leans her head in close to joan's:}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{it's definitely not lewie.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you're not exactly a disinterested party. you're always promoting his cause...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{number one, i've known the man for fifteen years, number two, he... loves you.}
<A>__{she glances at eddy, then consults the list:}
<B>__{on eddy}
<A>__{seated on the lawn nearby, paring an apple with a swiss army knife:}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{'eddy revere, a little moody, but a good friend and very reliable.}
<B>__{back to helen}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{an opinion i don't share, but... what do you think about vincent?}
<B>__{on vincent gallardo}
<A>__{gesturing expansively, as he relates some incident to his table partners:}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{he has a terrible temper. we know that.}
<B>__{back to helen}
<D>__{helen (v.o.) (cont'd) 'vincent gallardo. doubtful. we've never had an unpleasant word.' aren't you lucky. 'kenneth dowler...'}
<B>__{on kenneth dowler}
<A>__{he stands with a styrofoam cup in his hand, coming on to one of the members of the female chorus:}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{'always trying to connect with me, proposing private rehearsals at his apartment.' you know what he asked me yesterday?}
<B>__{back to helen and joan}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{what my cup size was.}
<P>__{(back to the list)}
<D>__{steve jewel! who's steve jewel?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{my piano tuner.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{is he weird or something?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{well everyone appears weird to me right now. so i put every possible name down, except for one, who happens to be post burglary.}
<A>__{helen returns to the list, tapping her finger on one of the names:}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i think it's him, the tree surgeon. he sounds very suspicious...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{just don't tell lewie about the phone message or the thing i got in the mail, because he'll just use it to...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i already did.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{helen.}
