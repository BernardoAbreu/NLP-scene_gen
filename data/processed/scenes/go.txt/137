<A>__{at her locker, ronna misdials the combination. frustrated, she pounds the locker, then re dials. simon approaches ronna gingerly. we stay back with claire, who sets to work opening a box of expired cookies. she half listens as ronna and simon have their discussion at the lockers, then at the time clock. simon follows ronna out into the alley. claire takes a seat atop a crappy console tv, eating an oatmeal cookie. the voices on the soap opera seem familiar.}
