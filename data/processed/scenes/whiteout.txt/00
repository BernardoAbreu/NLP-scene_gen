<A>__{antarctica. six million square miles of ice. the coldest place on earth. forty six countries have competing claims and maintain outposts. the antarctic treaty holds these claims in check. there is no regular law enforcement. a single u.s. marshal is assigned to the territory.}

<A>__{snow covered hills thrust up out of a barren, white wasteland. no buildings, no animals... nothing. closer: the hills are more defined. rows of jagged peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses. a fine `mist' of wind blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting ice. still closer: we track down through valleys, skirt crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat stretch of ice. hold on this scene of timeless, savage beauty, then... thud!!! a face, hooded and goggled in ecw (extreme cold weather gear) drops into frame, smashing down on the icy surface with such brutal impact, the shattered goggle shield pops out eyes stare blankly into camera locked in death. it's a man. camera slowly starts to pull back to see his limbs have snapped at unnatural angles, the head grotesquely twisted bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and spreads out down tiny cracks in the ice until, with startling speed, it turns dark and freezes. we pull back further and look down on the body, a bizarre shape in a spider's web of frozen blood. and slowly we pull back... further and further...until all is dazzling white. title: whiteout}
