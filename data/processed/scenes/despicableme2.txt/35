<A>__{classic spaghetti western sepia toned shot of el macho looking menacing. he looks like the large hispanic man from the mall, only younger and wearing a lucha libre outfit and mask (a mask which looks similar to the one gru imagined). el macho pushes the barkeep out of the way and grabs a large bottle from behind the bar.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{he was ruthless. he was dangerous. and as the name implies, very macho.}
<A>__{el macho pours himself a shot and then smashes the bottle over his own head. he reaches down and pulls up a rattlesnake from below the bar. he squeezes its head, squirting venom into the shot glass. he drinks it down and then eats the glass. he sticks the snake's fangs into a few dollars that he leaves on the bar, before breaking through the wall behind him, leaving an el macho shaped hole.}
