<L>__{exterior lazarus' home night}
<A>__{rae races outside, tripping down the front porch steps. she looks off at the blaze in the squash field. she frantically races toward the fire, the beeping increases.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{ronnie... ronnie!}
<B>__{beep beep... beep beep... beep beep... beep beep...}
<A>__{at the center of the blaze is an upside down humvee. to the left of the vehicle, a few soldier's bodies lay scattered. rae's legs lose all strength, she collapses and crawls across the squash plants. a far away voice is heard over the roaring flames.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{gal? gal?}
<A>__{rae crawls across a fallen soldier, following the sound of ronnie's alarm. she struggles to breathe, she almost faints. she finds a soldier face down. with all her strength she turns him over. it is ronnie, wide eyed and lifeless. an awful groan comes out of rae crippling sorrow. she pulls on his vest trying to wake him.}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{nn nn... nn nn... no... n'ronnie!}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{gal! you hearin' my voice?}
<A>__{rae looks up. the flaming humvee is gone. she is not pulling on ronnie's vest, but the tangled vines of a squash plant. laz stands at a safe distance, silhouetted in moonlight.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{you travelin' right now, gal. you asleep and you don't even know it.}
<P>__{(extends his hand)}
<D>__{now... come on inside with me.}
<A>__{rae looks like a terrified child. her eyes well with tears as she shakes her head. laz takes a step toward her.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{mm mm... mm mm...}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{come on, gal...}
<A>__{she turns and runs away as best she can. laz chases after her. he's much older than her and a bit slower, but her balance betrays her. laz wraps his arms around her. rae screams to the sky.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{no! nooo! noooooooooo!}
<A>__{and then, stillness. rae lies limp in laz's arms, unconscious. he reaches down and lifts her wrist to his face. the green screen of the digital watch pulsates with the alarm. he pushes the side button. the beeping stops. silence.}
