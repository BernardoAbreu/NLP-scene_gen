<A>__{jake signals and a formation of hunters rolls in, diving at the lead shuttle, which is already besieged by winged creatures. the cargo ramp is the scene of a pitched battle. na'vi hunters hurl themselves off their mounts in waves, overwhelming the troopers. hunters are shot, falling out of the ship, as others fly in. they shoot arrows and spears from the end of the ramp, and troopers fall back deeper into the fuselage. the panicked crew chief slams a switch and the ramp begins to close, a second before he is cut down by a spear. jake's leonopteryx plummets at the shuttle from behind. he swoops down, flairs to reduce speed, rolls off his mount and lands, tumbling on the shuttle's broad back as gunners try to swing their guns toward him but he rakes them with his ar, still running forward and jake pulls two grenades from his battle harness, yanking the pins out with his teeth. he hurls them down the intakes of the vtol turbofans as his leonopteryx banks in a tight arc back toward him and he sprints on as the grenades explode, shattering the turbines, which riddle the fuselage with shrapnel and jake leaps into space, landing on the back of his mount and reconnecting. they flap away, gaining altitude as fire blasts out of the bottom of the shuttle. on the flight deck, the pilot feels the ship dropping.}

<A>__{the pilot and copilot slam the throttle levers forward and the fusion engines blaze, thrusting the shuttle forward. it still falls, its remaining lift fans screaming, until it's clipping the tree tops when it gets enough translational lift to fly and the pilot pulls back on the stick, lifting the nose.}

<A>__{behind him, a surviving na'vi hunter runs forward and thoonk! arrowheads sprout from the pilots' necks and chests. the shuttle climbs out of control, at full acceleration. it slams into the underside of mons veritatis. it explodes, and hundreds of tons of flaming debris drop back into the forest. on the flight deck of the other shuttle, the pilots watch the wreckage falling.}
