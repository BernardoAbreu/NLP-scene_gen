<A>__{she must bend her neck to look all the way up at the ceiling where this cyclonic shape waltzes... studying.. at the room, then carol anne... an explosion from the tv set. the brightest flash yet experienced. a force that expels the intruder from the set and into the room. catapulting it past the family and into the wall right over the bed, where it leaves a dark pencil dot stain. the entire room shakes and the family is awake and panicked. the window cracks, the curtain rod slips. books and mementos fall from the open hutch. the medicine cabinet opens and prescription medicine splatters on the tiled floor. the room lights flare then die. every picture topples from the walls.}
