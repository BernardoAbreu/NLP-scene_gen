<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{he used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. when he was watching from the woods. why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{you mean jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?}
