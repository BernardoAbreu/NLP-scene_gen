<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{emily nods, putting on a brave face to spare lucy.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{it's just work. don't worry.}
<A>__{lucy nods okay. they walk on in silence for a moment.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{why do you do it if it makes you sad?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{my job? i don't know, i guess... i guess maybe i want to believe families can work, so i can have my own someday, i don't know does that make sense?}
