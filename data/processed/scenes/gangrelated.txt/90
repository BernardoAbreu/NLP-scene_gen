<D>__{this is not my fuck up! our shooting was supposed to be gang related and unsolved! only because we tagged a goddamn undercover cop do we need the fucking .44 for evidence! otherwise, we never woulda needed it. so don't point your finger at me!}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{alright, alright... but how are we supposed to explain how the same gun was used in two murder cases by two different killers when it was supposed to be in police custody?!}
