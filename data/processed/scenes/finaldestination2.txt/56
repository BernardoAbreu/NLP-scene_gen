<D>__{shut up!!!}
<A>__{the rottweiler cowers, and jorge shoves it to the floor, where it lands on its feet and fearfully trots away. jorge's face is once again pleasant, but it's a thin veneer. jorge sees clear and kimberly behind thomas and frowns.}

<A>__{clear rushes the door, shoulders it and expertly wriggles past jorge's grasp.}
<C>__{jorge}
<D>__{stop!!! you can't go in there!!!}
<A>__{clear tears into the bedroom, grabs the bedspread and throws it to the floor to reveal a young woman, naked, trembling with fear, takes a closer look at clear.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{we never meant to hurt you isa...you're not isabella!}
<A>__{meanwhile, jorge yells at thomas.}
<C>__{jorge}
