<L>__{interior mayfield's limo night}
<A>__{the car rides up madison avenue. mayfield marks up a bunch of memos in a leather bound folder. an aide we met earlier, john aimes, sits nearby.}
<C>__{aimes}
<D>__{there's just one more thing... and i hate to mention it now, but i just received it...}
<C>__{mayfield}
<D>__{speak, john.}
<A>__{aimes opens a folder, handing it to mayfield.}
<C>__{aimes}
<D>__{i had stern marling run a secondary audit on the miller financials.}
<A>__{we catch a glimpse of the top sheet as mayfield reads: "stern marling confidential audit miller capital we have reviewed the records you submitted and have found no way to legitimately substantiate a recent capital transfer of $412 million..." we hold on mayfield's face as he tries hard to conceal the spreading realization.}
<C>__{mayfield}
<D>__{who authorized this?}
<C>__{aimes}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{mayfield}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{and what did you conclude?}
<C>__{aimes}
<D>__{it's in front of you.}
<C>__{mayfield}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i didn't ask you what the paper said, john. i asked you what you thought. goldenrod 4.17.11 102.}
<C>__{aimes}
<P>__{(after a beat, carefully)}
<D>__{well... what do you think?}
<C>__{mayfield}
<D>__{i think... i think... that i don't see anything wrong here.}
<A>__{mayfield closes the folder and places it with the rest of his papers. aimes nods.}
