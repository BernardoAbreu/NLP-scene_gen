<A>__{ted closes the back of his camera. takes a deep breath. and forces a confident smile. he then peers into the...}
<B>__{shower}
<A>__{where christy malone limbers up. stretching her leg against the wall. wearing her sexy cheerleader uniform.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{i thought i'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, teddy bear.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i do? i mean, yeah, i do.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{i have to admit, i am so totally turned on. we should do it. now.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{do it?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{you know...take the pictures?}
<A>__{christy does her warm up contortionist poses for ted. clothes still on. as reflectors bounce strobes into the shower area. years of being a merciless tease, paying off right here and now. christy knows how to make love to the camera.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i remember the first time you walked into mrs. temple's class in 2nd grade. blue gingham dress. blond ponytail.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{which you pulled, hard!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that was code for "i like you."}
<A>__{christy giggles.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{wanna unzip me?}
<A>__{ted slowly unzips christy's top, catching a glimpse of her long, sensuous back. she resumes posing. flashing a bare shoulder. a coy look. she doesn't need direction. she's a natural.}
<C>__{christy }
<D>__{remember dress up day? you and charlie lifting skirts during recess.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{things change. now i'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.}
<A>__{christy slips off her cheerleader top. lowers her skirt. flings it aside. she's wearing only panties the size of a band aid. ted is mute. staring at her perfect body.}
<C>__{christy }
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you have changed since second grade.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{i mean, what do you think?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you expect me to think at a time like this? there isn't a drop of blood in my brain.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{oh, teddy bear, you're funny.}
<A>__{ted steps out of the shower. out of christy's sight, he squirms in his jeans. trying to hide his enthusiasm. music suddenly seems to come from nowhere. nine inch nails. "i want to fuck you like an animal."}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{god help me.}
<A>__{ted steps back into the shower. christy rubs an ice cube on her left nipple.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{i heard they do this on photo shoots. wanna to do the other one?}
<A>__{she tosses him the ice cube. he fumbles. it lands on the floor.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you're doing just fine, christy. believe me.}
<C>__{chrity}
<D>__{then i'm ready when you are.}
<A>__{ted looks through the lens. we can see him trembling. music blasts as ted's camera burns through film. they're both getting into it. water pulsating over her body. steam rising. christy begins lathering her breasts.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{i was always too shy to admit how much i liked you.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{come on, i was hamburger. you were porterhouse.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{maybe on the outside. but inside, deep down, i've always been dripping with special sauces.}
<P>__{(she smiles, sexily)}
<D>__{are you hungry?}
<A>__{is he hungry. he's been working up this appetite for ten years. he can barely contain himself.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{god, you are so hot.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{then you better get in the water, before you get burned.}
<A>__{ted calls her bluff. he sets aside his camera. walks right into the water. through the steam. toward christy. she wraps a leg around him, sucking face, wanting more.}
<C>__{christy }
<D>__{you and me, finally. this will be so fantastic, teddy bear. trust me.}
<A>__{suddenly ted stops. remembering what julie said about trust.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'm sorry, christy. i've been crazy about you forever, and this is definitely a page right out of my palm pilot, but i just can't go through with it.}
<A>__{he turns away, but christy presses her bare body against his back. wrapping her hands around his waist. caressing his chest, his stomach...}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{sure you can. you're only human. it's not like you're made of steel.}
<P>__{(she lowers her hand)}
<D>__{or are you?}
