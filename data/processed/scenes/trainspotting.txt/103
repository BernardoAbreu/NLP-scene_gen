<D>__{i wished i had gone down instead of spud. here i was surrounded by my family and my so called mates and i've never felt so alone, never in all my puff. since i was on remand they've had me on this programme, the state sponsored addiction, three sickly sweet doses of methadone a day instead of smack. but it's never enough, and at the moment it's nowhere near enough. i took all three this morning and now i've got eighteen hours to go till my next shot and a sweat on my back like a layer of frost. i need to visit the mother superior for one hit, one fucking hit to get us over this long, hard day.}
