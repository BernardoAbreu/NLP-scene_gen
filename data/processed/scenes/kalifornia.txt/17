<L>__{interior apartment kitchen few moments later}
<A>__{the room's crowded with people. there's a lot of noise "shop talk," banter. clipped conversations overlap, as we find brian with his friend eric. they are in the midst of making a blender of margaritas.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i'm talking about the mind and culpability of a serial killer. someone who has no ability to distinguish between right and wrong should not be imprisoned, let alone executed.}
<A>__{eric dumps in a handful of ice cubes as brian pours in the booze.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{oh, here we go again. let's just lay it all at the altar of misfiring synapses, amok biochemicals and horrendous childhoods.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{look, it's a fact, most of these people suffer from a severe chemical brain imbalance.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that enough tequila?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{probably not...}
<A>__{brian pours in the rest of the bottle.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(to eric)}
<D>__{the answer is research and treatment under hospital supervised conditions, not the electric chair!}
<A>__{eric looks for triple sec in the cupboards. peter overhears them on his way to the refrigerator.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah, until it's your mother's head they find in the refrigerator.}
<A>__{he pulls open the refrigerator door and grabs two beers. carrie steps up behind brian.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{thank god!}
<A>__{brian turns to see carrie now behind him. she wraps her arms around his neck.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(sarcastic to carrie)}
<D>__{ha, ha.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{yeah, but it'd sure make you feel better, wouldn't it?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{no, it wouldn't make me feel better.}
<A>__{peter finds triple sec in the refrigerator.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{...looking for this?}
<A>__{eric takes the triple sec from peter and pours some in the blender. he turns it on. it whines.}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(to brian)}
<D>__{if i have to listen to one more "tweed" talk about his dissertation, i'm going to throw up.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(to brian)}
<D>__{label it anyway you want, the bottom line is these people are evil, plain and simple.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(continuing with eric)}
<D>__{okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? well then let's start with adam and eve and the snake.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{who do i have to blow to get out of here?}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(reconsiders)}
<D>__{a... i gotta go.}
