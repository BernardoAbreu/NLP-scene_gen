<A>__{a slightly younger eddie is flipping through the lange book.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{...sitting on the couch of a t.a. i was trying to make, waiting for her to come back out of the bathroom... hoping she'd have a condom...}
<T>__{back to:}

<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{somehow, my unconscious had served that up... a memory i'd never even recorded. or was it there the whole time... and all i needed... was the access?}

<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{vern was right. this was no recreational drug.}
<A>__{eddie's eyes flick to the laptop in her bag, his manner suddenly intimate, confident.}

<D>__{cal berkeley has her oral history. i'd start there. her son is still alive. you could google him. sons of famous people always want to dish dirt about their parents. you'd get something no one else has, and you'd've gone the extra mile, a nice little apple for the professor.}
<A>__{during this speech, music comes up and the sound goes down...}
<B>__{several quick cuts...}
<A>__{eddie and valerie's mouths are moving... she's asking questions... he's supplying answers, lots of them...}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) information from the odd museum show, a half read article, some pbs documentary, was all bubbling up to my frontal lobes, mixing itself together into a sparkling cocktail of useful information.}
<A>__{valerie's whole posture is relaxing, the look in her eyes becoming... friendly.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) she didn't have a chance.}
