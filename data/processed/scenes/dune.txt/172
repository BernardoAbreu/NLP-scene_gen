<A>__{paul and jessica running. paul pulls jessica to a place in the wall where a small overhang offers shelter. jessica falls to the ground. she cries, pouring out her grief, but soon the sound of it is carried away by the building rush of wind. paul turns and looks out to the open desert, this portion of which is a dust ocean.}
