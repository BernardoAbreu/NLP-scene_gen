<A>__{ariadne, arthur, yusuf, eames and saito sit around the room, looking at files. cobb presides.}

<D>__{the mark is robert fischer, heir to the australian energy conglomerate, fischer morrow.}
<A>__{cobb opens a large presentation pad.}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(reads aloud)}
<D>__{"i will split up my father's empire."}
<A>__{cobb turns to the team.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{an idea robert fischer's conscious mind would never accept. we have to plant it deep in his subconscious.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{how deep?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{three levels down.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{a dream within a dream within a dream? is that even possible?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{yes. it is.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{now, the subconscious motivates through emotion, not reason, so we have to translate the idea into an emotional concept.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{how do you translate a business strategy into an emotion?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{that's what we have to figure out. robert and his father have a tense relationship. worse, even, than the gossip columns have suggested...}

<D>__{do you play on that? suggest breaking up his father's company as a 'screw you' to the old man?}

<A>__{eames thinks. paces. looking back at the board.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{try this... "my father accepts that i want to create for myself, not follow in his footsteps."}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{that might work.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{might? we'll have to do better than that.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{thanks for the contribution, arthur.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{forgive me for wanting a little specificity, eames.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{inception's not about specificity. when we get inside his head, we're going to have to work with what we find.}
<A>__{arthur shrugs, frustrated. and we }
