<A>__{william in the empty rolling stone office.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(ruefully)}
<D>__{well, it was fun.}
<C>__{lester bangs}
<D>__{they make you feel cool. and hey. i met you. you are not "cool."}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i know. even when i though i was, i knew i wasn't.}
<C>__{lester bangs}
<D>__{that's because we are uncool! and while women will always be a problem for guys like us, most of the great art in the world is about that very problem. good looking people have no spine! their art never lasts! they get the girls, but we're smarter.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i can really see that now.}
<C>__{lester bangs}
<D>__{yeah, great art is about conflict and pain and guilt and longing and love disguised as sex, and sex disguised as love... and let's face it, you got a big head start.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i'm glad you were home.}
<C>__{lester bangs}
<D>__{i'm always home! i'm uncool!}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{me too!}
<C>__{lester bangs}
<P>__{(leveling)}
<D>__{the only true currency in this bankrupt world if what we share with someone else when we're uncool.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(distraught)}
<D>__{i feel better}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{my advice to you. i know you think those guys are your friends. you want to be a true friend to them?}
<A>__{william takes a deep breath. looks at the research cassettes and notebooks. the empty page.}
<C>__{lester bangs}
<D>__{be honest and unmerciful.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're doing great. call me later is you want. i'm always up.}
