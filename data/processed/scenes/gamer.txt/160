<L>__{interior thorax bar continuous}
<A>__{the thorax bar is small, intimate, but ultra styled... the theme is insect. all manner of exotic bug preserved in glass, suspended in ice... one wall is a giant, black lit ant farm... green, glowing fireflies dart through the air... people lounge on plush seating, gobbling up creatively prepared bug delicacies fried pink grasshoppers, fat yellow grubs with red chili oil... angie takes a seat at the bar.}

<D>__{the usual?}
<A>__{she just winks, flirtatious. the bartender returns a smile and shakes up an aqua blue martini... to finish, he plops in a live, white larva... it curls and twists in the liquid, soaking the alcohol into it's pulp... she takes a sip, letting the larva curl around her tongue... swallows it down... as a guy takes a seat to her left his hair is shiny, slick black licorice.}
