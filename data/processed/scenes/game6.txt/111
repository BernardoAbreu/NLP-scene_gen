<A>__{steven and laurel are briefly immobilized by shock as the door comes flying open. nicky moves toward the candle lit couple. laurel realizes who he is and stands by the sofa. she zips her skirt. nicky is trying to understand what he sees, then he gets it.}

<D>__{laurel.}
<A>__{nicky holds his gun hand aloft, repeating the image of bill buckner with the baseball in his glove nicky's hallucination. then nicky issues a cry, a sound from the time before humans acquired language. it is the audible anguish of his life, from the fetus onward. we hear what he is saying in overlapping echoes and we realize he is crying out a name. we recognize the look on his face and the formation of syllables on his lips as elements we'd seen earlier on buckner's face when he shouted something as he made n}

<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{ste vennnn schwim merrrr!}
<A>__{laurel reacts with horror to the revelation of steven's identity. she rearranges her bra. nicky stumbles, drops his gun. it goes off. steven flees toward the shadows at the back of the loft, his hand moving toward the gun in his shoulder holster. nicky picks up his gun and begins to stalk him. steven fires twice striking a nearby lamp. the room is dark now. lit only by the blue glow of the tv. the tv sports roundup, which has been showing football highlights, has switched to baseball highlights of the red sox mets. nicky reaches laurel.}
<C>__{nicky}
<P>__{(crying out)}
<D>__{this is my daughterrrrr!}
<A>__{steven is wide eyed at the news.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{i don't think he knew, daddy.}
<A>__{nicky sees the photo of steven and his cat. he shoots twice, blows it away.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{daddy, i'm sorry. but he was so beautiful. i trusted him. when i saw what he really looks like }
<A>__{a voice from shadows:}
<C>__{steven}
<P>__{(os)}
<D>__{am i really so deeply repugnant?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{go home, laurel. tell your mother i will be late.}
<A>__{nicky walks toward steven's voice, toward the shadows.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you're going to die. you're a dead man. you're dead.}
<A>__{he notices laurel following behind him.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{look. i'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. but you're only eighteen. we can still turn it around.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{except i won't have a father anymore.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i will see you all the time. i will get a place right nearby. one room. no distractions. we'll talk.}
<A>__{he shouts into the darkness.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you're dead!}
<A>__{laurel puts her hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{what will we talk about?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{everything.}
<A>__{nicky sees one of the new york magazine ads, steven schwimmer's face mounted on the cardboard. he fires three times, wiping out schwimmer's eyes.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{will i believe you when you tell me something?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{there's nothing left for me to lie about.}
<A>__{nicky starts into the darkness only to see steven emerge from the shadows, his gun lowered. oddly, he seems distracted by something on another part of the room. he is looking at the tv set on the counter. nicky watches him approach the kitchen area. he follows, gun raised. steven sits on a stool to watch tv. nicky approaches warily, his gun aimed at steven's head, which is blue lit by the tv screen.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you're dead. i see you on a morgue slab drained of all fluids.}
<A>__{laurel follows at a distance to see what they're so interested in. nicky puts the gun muzzle flush against steven's temple.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.}
<C>__{laurel}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{daddy, wait.}
<A>__{steven is watching slow motion footage of bill buckner missing the slow roller.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{then they lost?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{why does it matter?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{if they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. it's all over.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{why do you care?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{they're my team.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{no. they're not your team. they're my team.}
<A>__{nicky cocks the hammer.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{they're my team, too. i grew up on boyleston street. right by fenway park. i went to fifty or sixty games a year. all by myself. i was one of those kids with scabby elbows. i called out to the players. `look over here. hi, i'm steven. my parents are divorced.'}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i went to college in boston so i could be near the red sox. i took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. my wife is from boston. lillian ziegler?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{the red sox were my world. i surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{if you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? answer carefully. this is important. you could have gone to the theater last night. there was no game last night.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{because i can't bear to watch. when they lose, i die inside. it's like some little person named steve just crumples up and dies. i wait for the scores. i still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. i can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. i've done it too many times. and i can't do it anymore.}
<A>__{nicky lowers the gun.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i was six years old the day pesky hesitated throwing home and slaughter scored all the way from first. that's when i knew the red sox were my team. pity and terror.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{when i traveled through asia this summer, i went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so i could call up sports phone in new york and get the scores. i drove through the war in afghanistan calling sports phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{what about my play?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{yes. and no more evasive tactics.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{it's your best play, nicky.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{see, daddy.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i've seen it twice. i went back tonight to be sure. it's a brave and honest piece of work.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{what else?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{an artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{and you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{you're out of bullets.}
<A>__{nicky points the gun at the palm of his own left hand and pulls the trigger. a click.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{see, daddy.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{and peter redmond helped immensely. these pauses were exquisitely timed. he made us wait and wait. he built a gorgeous tension and suspense.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{we worked very hard on the pauses.}
<A>__{nicky places it on the counter.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i called sports phone from lhasa, tibet. freezing in my little rented fiat. sheep on a hillside. rocky debris dating back millions and millions of years, from the time the himalayas thrust up when the plates of india and asia collided. red sox 3, white sox 2. a moment in the history of the world.}
<A>__{nicky takes steven's head and moves it tenderly against his chest. when nicky releases the head, he has steven's toupee in his hand. he looks at it briefly, then hands it to laurel.}
