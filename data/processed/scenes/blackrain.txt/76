<D>__{i will get him for you, nick.}
<A>__{nick looks at this thick bellied, alcoholic cop. not a very reassuring thought. two men carrying plastic pails cross in front of the tub. young, muscular yakuza, their bodies covered with exquisite tattoos. they stare openly at nick. one makes a joke. both laugh obscenely as they slip into the hot tub.}

<A>__{ich nods. nick eyes them for a long beat, then climbs out of the tub.}
