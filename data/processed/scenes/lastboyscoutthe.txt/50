<A>__{jimmy enters and shuts the door behind him. he scans the floor, covered with clothes, bottles, etc. picks up a carelessly discarded can of right guard deodorant. turns it upside down, and unscrews the bottom. inside, the can is hollow and empty. the perfect hiding place. jimmy heaves a sigh of relief. removes a little plastic baggie filled with white powder. stashes it in his shorts. starts to replace the lid. stops. frowns. reaches into the can a second time and pulls out a yellow envelope. he looks at it, perplexed. puts it in his pocket. replaces the lid. tosses the can on the floor. flushes the toilet. leaves.}
