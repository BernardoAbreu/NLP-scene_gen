<L>__{interior crime lab. night.}
<A>__{the tormented investigator lies on the floor of his lab, staring at the ceiling. he winces in discomfort. he is lying on something. he rolls over and retrieves the irritation from his pocket. it is the "esc" computer key he prized from jerome's keyboard. he gazes at the key for a moment and then gets to his feet. he resurrects an old fingerprint kit from a cupboard. carefully removing the key from the specimen bag marked, "morrow, jerome" he begins to dust it for a fingerprinterior he places the key under a camera. the enlarged print appears on the lefthand side of his computer screen. the word "match" blinks onto the screen. however the face that appears from the computer's databank is not that of "morrow, jerome" but "luca, vincent". the investigator regards the photograph in disbelief. detective hugo casually enters the lab, something odd in his nonchalant demeanor.}
