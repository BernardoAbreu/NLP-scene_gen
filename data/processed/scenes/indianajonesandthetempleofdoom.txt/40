<L>__{36. exterior river clearing}
<A>__{the raft drifts out of the main part of the river and glides to ward a clearing. its three soaked and bedraggled passengers lie motionless in the bottom. indy's hand drags alongside the raft, his fingers leaving a trail in the almost still water. battered and exhausted, but always indy's "bodyguard", shorty looks over at him worriedly }

<D>__{oh no...i ripped my dress. where are we anyway?}
<A>__{the raft floats to a gentle stop we see it nudge against a pair of dark feet. indy squints up into the sun and sees some thing.}

<D>__{india...}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{holy cow india? how do you know we're in }
<A>__{she rolls over and yelps as she looks up at the bizarre, painted face of a shaman. silhoutted against the blazing sun, the skin ny little old man in a loincoloth stares down at them in the raft. an eerie wind rises and howls. the old man places his palms to gether and moves his hands up to touch his forehead. willie and short round watch mystified as indiana returns the old shaman's silent greeting.}
