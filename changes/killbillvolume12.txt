The high contrast B/W turning the red blood into black blood. A hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice ENTERS FRAME holding a white handkerchief with the name "BILL" sewn in the corner, and begins tenderly wiping away the blood from the young woman's face. Little by little as the Male Voice speaks, the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the audience. But what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the "BILL" of the title. In another    age men who shook the world for their    own purposes were called    conquerors. In our age, the men who    shake the planet for    their own power and greed are called    corrupters. And of the    world's corrupters Bill stands alone.    For while he corrupts the world, inside himself he is pure.}

An ornamental iron and tempered-glass bookcase that has framed family photos, display toys, some African art, and a collection of painted commemorative plates depicting the negro experience in the American military. Starting with a plate featuring Cripis Atkins in the revolutionary war, negro troops in union blue during the civil war, Buffalo soldiers fighting Indians, the Jim Crow troops of the first world war, the colored troops of world war two, Korea, Vietnam, and finally Colin Powell....The Bride and The Housewife CRASH THROUGH all this reducing everything to rubble.

The Abbot, at first, tried to console Pai Mei, only to find, Pai Mei was inconsolable.

Not only did she know Emilio was dead, she knew she had killed him.

<DIAL>__{Facing Karen Wong, was the most frightening moment I have ever experienced. And that includes three years with that evil bastard Pai Mei. Before that strip turned blue, I was a woman, I was your woman. I was a killer, who killed for you. Before that strip turned blue, I would have jumped a motorcycle on to a speeding train ...for you. But once that strip turned blue, I could no longer do any of those things. Not anymore. Because now I was a mother. A mother who only had one thought on her mind. Please don't harm my baby. Can you understand that?}

<DIAL>__{Yes. But why tell me now, and not then?}
<CHAR>__{THE BRIDE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{THE BRIDE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, but it's the right decision. And I made it for my daughter. Everybody on this earth deserves to start with a clean slate. But with us - my daughter would be born into a world she shouldn't be. Robbing her of the one thing everybody deserves. She would be born with blood stains. I had to choose. I chose her.}

Using only her left arm, with the sheathed Hanzo sword in its grip, she blocks all of his blows, right arm unmoving down at her side...sort of like Pai Mei did to her earlier...his sword and her sheath lock together...they're close to each other, she brings up her right arm, sticks out two fingers, and hits Bill on ten different pressure points on his body. Then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm. His body jolts, like he's just had a heart attack...he coughs up a little blood...he looks at her. Their faces are very close... The face of the cold ice woman Ninja, melts away before our eyes, and the face of Beatrix Kiddo is filled once again with compassion.}

It BURSTS...WE HEAR A SOUND, like of a tire blowout... He falls to the beach...dead. The Bride walks over to his body. She unsheaths her Hanzo sword. Blood lies in a pool, by Bill's mouth. She dips the tip of the blade in the blood, leaving the tiniest of crimson smudges. She then removes the Bill handkerchief, and wipes Bill's blood from off the blade onto the white cloth. She lets the Bill handkerchief drop onto his body. The Jingi sword Hattori Hanzo created, just for her, for this purpose, has come to the end of its journey. Beatrix, in a moment    of enormous generosity, allows herself, one final tear, shed    for her corrupter, her enemy, the father of her child,...her    MAN. The tear is for her as well. For she's very aware she    will never ever be completely any other man's WOMAN. EX CU The Hanzo BLADE slowly sliding into the wood sheath. EX CU the single teardrop, sliding down her cheek. The blade disappears inside the sheath. The teardrop falls of her chin. Her journey, her revenge, her victory, her unfinished business, is completed. The Bride exits the beach. Bill doesn't.}
