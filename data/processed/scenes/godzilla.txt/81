<A>__{a sign reading: subway station: 23rd street sunset we crane down to reveal several military sedans pulling up into flat iron square (where broadway meets 5th). sergeant o'neal leads the team out of the cars and down a subway entrance.}
<L>__{interior subway stairwell continuous sunset}
<A>__{marching down the stairs, the team enters into the very large subway station. for all we see it seems like a normal subway station except for the fact that every one of the team members look astonished.}
<C>__{sergeant o'neal}
<D>__{lt. anderson and his men found this late this afternoon.}
<A>__{the camera makes a hundred and eighty degree turn as we suddenly see what the team is staring at...}
<B>__{an enormous hole}
<A>__{the four normal subway tunnels have been carved out making one gigantic tunnel. debris and crumbled brick are everywhere. several soldiers with flashlights approach the hole. lt. anderson moves over to the astonished group. some of the scientists fan out, examining the area.}
<C>__{lt. anderson}
<D>__{we were checking the office building above when we discovered the floor was gone.}
<A>__{low angle revealing the hole in the ceiling we see that not only is the ceiling gone but the building above is hollowed and torn to shreds. another hole in the building leads to the street.}
<C>__{lt. anderson}
<D>__{when we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{christ. how many tunnels lead off the island?}
<C>__{lt. anderson}
<D>__{only five, sir. we've checked them all. he hasn't used any of them.}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{have them sealed off.}
<C>__{lt. anderson}
<D>__{and how should we do that, sir?}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, i don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!}
<A>__{angle inside darkened tunnel as the soldiers slowly move down deeper into the tunnels, their flashlight beams scan the area. could they stumble onto something dangerous? angle nick as he approaches major hicks and sergeant o'neal.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. he's just an animal.}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{what are you suggesting?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{when i needed to catch earthworms, i knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. i had to draw them out.}
<A>__{angle soldiers darkness still moving deeper into the tunnel we get the feeling these soldiers may just waken a sleeping giant.}
<B>__{back to team}
<A>__{nick moves to the edge of the platform, looking off into the dark tunnel.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{all we need to do is find out what it wants, what it needs, and he'll come to us.}
<A>__{angle soldiers darkness the lead soldier sees something. cautiously he moves forward thinking he's onto something. we hear something moving in the darkness. we follow his beam as the noise grows clearer. the beam falls onto something on the floor...}
<B>__{a fish}
<A>__{flopping on the ground is a large fish. as the beam moves farther along we see two, no, three fish ahead.}
