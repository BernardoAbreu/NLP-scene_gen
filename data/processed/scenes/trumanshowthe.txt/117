<D>__{by definition truman has to be free of censorship, but has the recent violence and profanity caused a problem for the sponsors...?}
<A>__{sylvia shuts out the conversation on the television, focusing on the window that displays truman, still buried in his book. she comes close to the screen, catching his melancholy. she has a camera and a white envelope in her hand. with a look of resolve, she takes her fountain pen and writes truman's name on the envelope in her familiar blue ink.}
