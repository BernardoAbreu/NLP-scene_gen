<L>__{interior helen's apartment day}
<A>__{close: xanax bottle. shaking hands dump out pills. four. six. two, put back. one more, put back. helen: ravaged. watching herself in mirror as she gulps the}
<B>__{remaining pills. door bell rings o.s.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm not seeing anybody.}
<A>__{we hear muffled voices andy and m.j. helen, as she realizes andy is letting m.j. in, goes to the bathroom door and tries to slam and lock it: andy beats her to it, blocking with his foot in the door.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you're fired.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i know. do come and meet your guest.}
<A>__{m.j. appears. taking in helen's condition due to a wild night with ruben? helen moves from the bathroom down the hall to her office, as...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{we've got another one.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that's no surprise.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{but it's a different m.o.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{then what do you need me for?}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{she was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. where it says "no dumping." her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose. it's all different but it seems so the same. artificial and posed ... something's wrong with it.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style? that doesn't happen. these men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual. the method itself is part of the pleasure...}
<A>__{they've turned into the office. something is wrong...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{who turned off the internet computer...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i turned it off. it's like an open window he can climb right in...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{he comes in the window, we maybe grab him. where's the on switch?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{have you got a warrant? get the hell out o here! this is the only space i have left in the world ! why can't you leave me out of it?}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{helen the killer directly contacted you. his interest in you is intense . i'm worried about you. i don't want to lose you. i know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. the only chance we have to trap him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so, you can turn internet back on, or i do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that little winona ryder manner... you're more convincing as clint eastwood.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{clint is putting a guard on you. but if you swear to leave the computer on, winona will assign him to the hall outside.}
<A>__{helen has to laugh. the laugh turns to a hacking cough.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{she's smoking again.}
<A>__{andy leaves. helen sits, and with the care of someone handling a rattlesnake, turns the computer on. meanwhile...}
<B>__{the phone rings.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{hello?... oh...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{...yes, she's right here.}
<A>__{helen hangs the phone to m.j. the air is a little more charged... helen goes back to the computer.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{ruben.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{hello, ruben...}
<P>__{(listens, nods)}
<D>__{so that's that...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{please thank inspector goetz for taking care of me last night.}
<A>__{m.j. delivers the message straight faced.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{ruben, dr. hudson wants me to thank you for taking care of her last night.}
<P>__{(hangs up)}
<D>__{lab report on the new one. at least two guys penetrated her. there were two kinds of sperm. the poor thing. what it must have been like.}
<A>__{helen has come alert...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{she was near a sign that said "no dumping?" two kinds of sperm the lab said one was a secretor and the other was not?}
<A>__{m.j. mumbles a surprised yes. helen is at computer.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{there were needle marks. but no drugs in her blood.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{so far nothing they test for comes up positive.}
<A>__{helen has a window type screen: she clicks icons...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{is that it?}
<C>__{m.j.}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{that's exactly... i could have taken that same picture, this morning.}
<B>__{a rather grainy picture of a dead girl spread out in a suggestive pose in an empty field. a sign right by her says}
<A>__{"no dumping."}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he's switched from desalvo to the hillside strangler. the strangler was two men, that's why there are two kinds of sperm. his idea of a joke, very witty our boy.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{that's not consistent... you said they never changed their style, they're robots...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. tell them to test for the chemicals found in windex. that's a product for cleaning with...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{i know windex, for god's sake, i clean my own windows...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it's what bianchi and buono injected into one of their victims.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<P>__{(sensing something appalling)}
<D>__{injected windex! why would he switch to a new m.o.?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him. serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive. this guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex. he's playing a game with us. who will he imitate next? maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame. just to prove he's better than all of them. they got caught; he didn't.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{he'll get caught. if he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{who's going to catch him? you?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and if you do, there'll be another one. and one after that.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<P>__{(gently, surprised)}
<D>__{you're afraid of him.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{this one, yes. i was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one i've felt personally terrified of. he's something new and unheard of. i don't know what he wants.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm giving you clint outside.}
