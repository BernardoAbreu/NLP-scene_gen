<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{it just didn't seem real and now that it is, i hate it! it's so unfair!}
<A>__{dolores, sitting in her armchair, mutters as though by rote }
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{fare is what you pay on the train to jersey. fair is the place that smells like manure where, if you're real lucky, you win a blue ribbon for your home made pickles. fair is a sky without a cloud and a face with a mark. fare is food. what fair isn't is everything else.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{well, i think i speak for all of us when i say that we've heard quite enough from dolores.}
<A>__{dolores chuckles. simon continues to wills }
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{now, correct me if i'm wrong, but i believe what you're saying is that while the end may be in sight, it has not yet arrived.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{that's right. the tumor's begun to interfere with the function of her heart, but she }
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{then why exactly have you called us here?}
<A>__{wills falters, looking at him incredulously.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i cut short a lunch date, shannon's missing her low impact aerobics class, and dolores has delayed the start of her happy hour surely you must have had good reason.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i thought charlotte's health might be of some interest you.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{it is. you could have told me all about it on the telephone.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i also thought it might be a good idea if we discussed ways to make her as comfortable as possible for the }
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{charlotte loathes comfortable. i never sought to bore her with comfort while she was well, why should i start now that she's sick?}
<A>__{wills stares at simon, his face ashen and full of contempt }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{tell me, are you really so cold? or is it just a pose that you've cultivated?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{it's a pose that i've cultivated.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i chose it, as a sort of smoke screen, some time after attending my twentieth funeral in as many months.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{it's quite all right. but, honestly, it shocks me how often you people forget. our phone books have as many numbers crossed out as written in. so that while death is certainly as painful to us as it is to you, we do not find it nearly so... extraordinary.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{don't misunderstand me. i adore charlotte and when she dies, i would... were it not already in that state... cry my heart dry.}
<A>__{shannon looks at simon and burst into tears again. simon holds her even closer, rubbing her back.}
