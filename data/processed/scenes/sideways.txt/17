<L>__{interior gas station #1 day}
<A>__{miles is pumping gas. jack is stretching his legs nearby or perhaps cleaning the windshield. a cellphone rings. jack reaches into his pocket.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(looking at the phone)}
<D>__{it's christine.}
<P>__{(snapping it open)}
<D>__{hey you.}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{you guys having fun?}
<A>__{christine's voice is so loud that jack has to hold the phone away from his ear.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah. all twenty minutes so far have been a blast.}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{good. that's good.}
<A>__{a silence, then }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so what's up?}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{just seeing how you're doing. and, um, mom and i were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted tony levin to sit next to the feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?}
<A>__{jack looks at miles in a mute appeal for sympathy.}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{so what do you think? with the feldmans?}
<A>__{jack hasn't even really heard the question.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah. the feldmans.}
<A>__{as the conversation continues, miles replaces the gas pump, screws the gas cap back on, and together the guys get back into the car. we drive away with them.}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{really? because i don't know, i was thinking that }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, then put him at the singles table.}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{the problem with that is that then there's one extra }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{then put him with the feldmans. whatever you and your mom decide is fine with me.}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{don't dismiss me. i'm trying to include you in this decision. he's your friend.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i didn't dismiss you. i told you what i thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. besides, this is supposed to be my time with miles. i hope you're not going to call every five minutes.}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{i'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{honey, i'm just saying you know i need a little space before the wedding. isn't that the point of this? isn't that what we talked about with dr. gertler?}
<A>__{a silence. then }
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{why are you being so defensive?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't know, christine. perhaps it's because i feel attacked.}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{i ask you one simple question, and suddenly i'm attacking you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{listen. i will call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{bye.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{jack slams his cellphone shut, momentarily blinded with rage.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{tony levin? why did you fucking invite tony levin?}
