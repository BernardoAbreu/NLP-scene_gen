<A>__{paul enjoys the riposte, looks at jane who is shrinking within herself.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i will see you two inside i think we're all at the same table.}
<P>__{(sotto to jane)}
<D>__{you're finally learning to be flexible. glad you changed your mind about tom.}
<A>__{he passes through the detector... tom starts to step through it she pulls him back.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i don't want to go in there and sit with everybody.}
<P>__{(imagining it)}
<D>__{i can't...why don't you go?}
<A>__{he considers this option as she waits.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{suppose i go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby bar. how's that?}
<C>__{jane}

<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you're not going to take off on me, are you?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{uh uh.}
<A>__{she steps on the escalator... riding upwards, concern deepens, anxiety flows.}
<B>__{on tom}
<A>__{watching her to up the escalator, he finds himself doing simplest thing, stepping onto a moving step.}
<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{jane four steps ahead of him not yet aware of him. he moves past one other man until he is standing directly behind her.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i just want you to know that my giving up the correspondents' dinner puts tremendous pressure on you.}
<A>__{jane turns and is a bit blown away by his gesture life threatens to be good. and now jane bumps a bit at the top of the escalator, regaining her balance by grabbing tom's offered hand. as they walk they continue to deliberately hold hands.}
