<P>__{(concentrating on the tabloid)}
<D>__{there isn't a single name here that gives off vibrations...}

<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{anything there with a name like "cigarette girl"?}

<D>__{mmmmmm..."cigarette girl"... no, no horse with a name like that...}
<A>__{sidney pushes the item back towards bartha.}
<B>__{wife}
<A>__{mrs. bartha's attention is attracted by sidney's gesture. she looks up, made aware of this strange by play.}

<P>__{(fractional pause)}
<D>__{he likes to use the real names...}

<D>__{where are we running? what am i missing here?}
<C>__{bartha}
<D>__{waiter, the check.}

<C>__{wife}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{that's the horse! shotgun shotgun in the fifth!}
<A>__{she quickly studies her newspaper again. as quickly, bartha leans across the table and snatches it out of her hands. in doing so, he upsets the glass of champagne, which contains only a few drops.}

<A>__{he is uneasy, ashamed of himself.}
<C>__{bartha}
<D>__{foolishly, lorry, and i hope you'll understand... this cigarette girl...i was kidding around with her...this girl, i mean...i was kidding around and she took it seriously. it was a case of bad judgment, lorry, bad taste...and i'm just sorry, lorry, that's all...}

<A>__{she presents her fur to her husband, and turns her back, inviting him to put it around her shoulders.}
<B>__{bartha and wife}
<A>__{another angle, favoring bartha. he has not fully understood the significance of his wife's gesture. he studies her. she confirms his hopes as she adds:}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{leo, this is one of the cleanest things i've seen you do in years...}
<A>__{with the fur around her shoulders, she turns and takes her husband's arm with some pride. they walk away. camera erases back to include sidney. he is angry at himself more for the failure of his efforts at blackmail than any sense of shame at the attempt.}
<B>__{otis elwell}
<A>__{a medium long shot. at a booth on the other side of the bar sits a dapper gentleman with a twinkle of malice in his eyes. he has been watching the altercation with keen interest and satisfaction. elwell gives some instructions to a waiter who is serving him with drinks, pointing towards sidney.}
<B>__{sidney}

<A>__{from sidney's viewpointerior elwell beckons.}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{he comes round the circular bar. he shows no eagerness to join elwell, but approaches the table. elwell makes a gesture, inviting sidney to sit. sidney doesn't accept it.}

<C>__{elwell}
<P>__{(lightly)}
<D>__{if it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{a close shot. while elwell continues, he is not looking at sidney. elwell's expression of dislike of hunsecker is not overemphatic; but sidney senses, nevertheless, that it is very real and this gives him a new idea.}
<C>__{elwell}
<P>__{(continuing over scene)}
<D>__{...talk of a wake! they'd club each other to cater the affair for free!}
<B>__{resume elwell and sidney}
<A>__{elwell looks up at sidney as he continues.}
<C>__{elwell}
<P>__{(happily)}
<D>__{by the way, did i hear something about j.j. giving you the flit gun treatment he shut you out of the column.}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{why?}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{sidney has rapidly resumed his manner of resentment (in order to exploit elwell's dislike of hunsecker).}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you don't know that lunatic yet? whims egotistic whims! like the gag when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!}
<P>__{(a pause, then:)}
<D>__{that's what the fight with bartha was about. "leo", i says, "hunsecker froze me out. so i'm eating humble pie this month please print me an item."}
<C>__{elwell}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{and, instead, he printed his heel in your face?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(morose)}
<D>__{i see you're full of human feelings...}
<B>__{elwell}
<A>__{he has lost interest in sidney.}
<C>__{elwell}
<P>__{(with a shrug)}
<D>__{like most of the human race, sidney, i'm bored. i'd go a mile for a chuckle...}
<A>__{elwell's voice fades: his attention has been caught by...}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{...three people are passing the table, squeezing their way past; a man with two very fetching young women. elwell's eyes are riveted to the anatomy that is temptingly displayed.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(noting elwell's preoccupation)}
<D>__{...and two miles for a pretty girl...?}
<B>__{elwell}
<A>__{he is unembarrassed at sidney's all too accurate estimate.}
<C>__{elwell}
<P>__{(lightly)}
<D>__{three...even four...}
<A>__{elwell turns back towards the papers on his table, a zippered document case and some publications among which a columnist might search for scandal; among these is a magazine of semipornographic nature.}
<C>__{elwell}
<P>__{(continuing, casually)}
<D>__{then you're really washed up with hunsecker...?}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{the nature of elwell's reading tastes is also not lost on sidney. with his eyes glancing at the magazine, sidney now accepts the original offer to sit down. he produces the slip of paper that bartha rejected, offering it as illustration.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{this is how much i'm washed with j.j....}
<A>__{as elwell reads, sidney continues giving a passing scrutiny apparently casual to a picture of a girl on the magazine cover.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{look, otis, i make no brief for my bilious private life, but he's got the morals of a guinea pig and the scruples of a gangster.}
<A>__{elwell shows no undue enthusiasm for the item.}
<C>__{elwell}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{a fine, fat dirty item.}
<P>__{(offering it back to sidney)}
<D>__{who's it about?}
<A>__{but sidney doesn't take the paper back; he explains:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{a kid named dallas, who runs a dinky jazz quintet.}
<P>__{(he leans closer)}
<D>__{he keeps company with j.j.'s screwball sister...}
<B>__{elwell}
<A>__{this does get a reaction, a flicker of genuine interest. elwell reads the item for a second time.}
<B>__{sidney and elwell}
<A>__{watching elwell read, sidney encourages:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{it's a real goody if, like me, you wanna clobber j.j.!}
<A>__{now elwell lays the item down in front of him. clearly, he is considering it. sidney prompts again.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{he's got his tv tomorrow. he'd read it just before rehearsals.}
<A>__{elwell nods. but he is still reluctant.}
<C>__{elwell}
<P>__{(cautiously)}
<D>__{mmm. trouble is i can't think of any good reason why i should print anything you give me. i can't even think of a bad reason.}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{sidney drops his eyes to the magazine once more. he fingers it in a preoccupied but significant way.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{suppose i introduce you to a lovely reason, otis. one that's good and bad...and available?}
<B>__{elwell}
<A>__{his eyes go from the magazine to sidney; he gets the point alright.}
<C>__{elwell}
<D>__{i'm not an unreasonable man...}
<A>__{elwell reaches for the slip of paper once more.}
<B>__{sidney and elwell}
<A>__{in picking it up, elwell clearly implies his readiness to accept the item on conditions. sidney, in his turn, gets this pointerior he turns towards the passing waiter.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{waiter! the check.}
