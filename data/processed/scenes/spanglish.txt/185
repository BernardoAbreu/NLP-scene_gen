<A>__{moving camera...the small house turned restaurant..little flickers of light...}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{my mother never told me the details of her visit to the restaurant. but she often referred to it as the greatest conversation of her life.}
<L>__{interior restaurant very late night...}
<A>__{they are lying post coitally in each other's arms on a sofa just inside the dining room..they are covered by a table cloth. they hold hands above the cover...each private but still somehow in contact.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{oh, johnny, why is everything so damn confusing?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{culpa.}
<A>__{flor's pleasure zone is rocked. she smiles at his first spanish word. she is wrestling with large feelings of pleasure and large ominous thoughts.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{is your mind racing?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i would say my mind has evaporated...but that there are remnants still standing waiting to fall. it feels pretty good.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{like happy?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{like happy.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{you think that will last?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's already gone.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{i understand what you mean.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't understand what i mean.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{that it's getting late. that responsibilities have entered your brain. don't hide that from me. and really, one large reason we are here is because you respect me as a mother and i respect you as a father..}
<A>__{he is looking at her...she is disconcerted.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you're a great and wild mother.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{you are a beautiful father.}
<A>__{she looks at him..they kiss...tenderness..heat...intimacy.}
<C>__{flor }
<D>__{when cristina was young, i would say i want to take any man who wants me to the park and i will tell whether i want him from the way he is with cristina. i wish you had been in the park then.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{any reaction?}
<A>__{john considering and then the answer comes to him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{exactly!..}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{you know, i always think about when you...oh, there's no pointerior i talk too much...}
<P>__{(a bit of emotion)}
<D>__{...because i don't know if we ever talk again.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey, hey..how do you get there? wait.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{yes you do. be honest.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm being honest.}
<P>__{(indicates their bodies)}
<D>__{look at us i think i call it honesty.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{what are we going to do go home, let our hearts go back in our bodies, see each other a few more times. make a tragedy out of us..}
<A>__{she kisses him again...starts to cry....looks at him..emits a small cooing sound.}
<C>__{flor }
<D>__{ahhhhhhh.}
<P>__{(sudden energy)}
<D>__{there are some mistakes you cannot risk when you have kids...please, are you ready to go?}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(urgently)}
<D>__{no. i'm not. no.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{stay put for a second. stay here. once our feet touch that floor, i'm going to get too many brain cells back. so don't be in such a hurry. that floor, flor, is going to eat us alive.}
<P>__{(she settles back he is energized)}
<D>__{so you think it was a mistake up to now.}
<P>__{(she nods "yes")}
<D>__{that's rough.}
<A>__{she nods again..trying to gut things out...but as her foot touches the floor, she must say one last thing to him.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{the mistake....i love it.}
