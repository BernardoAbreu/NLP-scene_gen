<A>__{a busy street under the subway overpass. we see a neighborhood bar on the corner }
<L>__{interior day queens bar}
<A>__{at this time of day the place is deserted. a plasma screen shows a baseball game. a drunk guy is half asleep at the corner table. sitting at the bar, ben is nervous, tense... he removes the steeped tea bag from his cup. ben stares at himself in the mirror, behind the bottle display shelves. it is not his mirror image that he is observing. his gaze seems to pierce through his own reflection, to dive beyond, into the very depths of his soul. angela interrupts, across from him, behind the bar. she works here.}

<D>__{what are you looking at?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{nothing special...}

<P>__{(playfully)}
<D>__{come on, you've been looking at yourself for more than half an hour. you never used to be so vain.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you can't avoid them. they're everywhere...}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{the mirrors... in the department store, at every street corner, in the windows of every fucking building in this city. i feel like i'm not the one looking into the mirrors, but rather they're looking at me.}
<A>__{angela smiles, not sure if he is serious }
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you need a drink.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no, i'm serious.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{don't you think you're being a little bit paranoid?}
<A>__{ben observes the palm of his hand.}
<C>__{angela }
<D>__{mirrors are just glass and silver, ben...}
<A>__{angela smiles at him and continues to polish the drinking glasses.}
