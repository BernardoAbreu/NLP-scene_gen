<L>__{exterior assembly hall day}
<A>__{the crowd waits. the doors open and a page boy dashes out and runs to the continental captain at the recruiting table.}
<C>__{page boy}
<D>__{twenty eight to twelve, the levy passed!}
<A>__{the continental captain motions to an assembled squadron. they raise their muskets and fire a volley into the air. other soldiers, strike up a martial air on fifes and drums. volunteers crowd around the recruiting table, yelling and jostling for position. the delegates walk out. both patriots and loyalists give marion a wide berth. marion sees gabriel, standing near the crowd at the recruiting table. marion walks up to him.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{father, i've lost respect for you. i thought you were a man of principle.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{when you have children, i hope you'll understand.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{when i have children, i hope i don't hide behind them.}
<A>__{marion looks closely at gabriel.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{do you intend to enlist without my permission?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{they lock eyes for a moment, then gabriel turns from his father and walks away, joining the crush around the recruiting table. marion stands alone in the middle of the chaos. the fifes and drums continue to play. marion doesn't hear them. harry lee walks out of the assembly hall with a triumphant group of patriots who look at marion coldly. lee excuses himself, and steps over next to marion. lee sees that marion is watching gabriel at the enlistment table.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{one of yours?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{gabriel.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i recognize him now. is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{no, thank the lord. he's more like his mother.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i will see to it that he serves under me.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{they shake hands. then lee walks over to the soldiers. marion takes a last look at gabriel, then heads off through the crowded square, moving against the tide of men headed toward the recruiting table.}
