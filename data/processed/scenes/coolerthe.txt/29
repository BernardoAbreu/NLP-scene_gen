<L>__{interior bernie's motel room night}
<A>__{natalie's hand flips on the television. another bizarre religious service. we pull back from the screen as she tries to change the channel. just gets a whole lot of static. bernie's standing uncomfortably in the middle of the room.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{you should complain about this.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{i'm not here that much. drink? sorry, all i got's gin.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{nah. i've had my fill. go ahead.}
<A>__{bernie walks over to the dresser, pours himself a shot. natalie glances around. she notices bernie's dead plants...}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{you know, once they're dead, they don't really grow back. in case, that's what you're waiting for.}
<A>__{her eyes land on the empty cat bowl. she's about to say something, when she picks up on bernie's expression. let's not even go there. she gestures to an old record player in the corner.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{so... got any music?}
<A>__{bernie opens one of the kitchenette cupboards. bare shelves... except for a lone record up on top. he brings it down. it's a sinatra album. never been opened. natalie looks on as bernie meticulously removes the record from its sleeve. he blows a few particles of dust from its surface. then delicately lays it on the turntable. the way he goes about this is incredibly ceremonious. with as much care as given to disarming a nuclear weapon. natalie can't help but smile. bernie lowers the needle to the first cut of the record. everything seems to be going so well, until... skreeeeee! the needle skids across the surface of the record with a sound worse than chalk on a blackboard. bernie opens his mouth in a silent grimace... and a delicious laugh comes out. it's natalie's laugh. talk about a tension breaker. bernie turns to her, shrugs. he tries again. this time the needle catches... and sinatra takes command of the room. he's singing "this town," a finger snapping upbeat valentine to vegas. marred only by a slight clicking caused by the scratch. natalie summons bernie over with her wagging forefinger. he picks up his glass, shuffles over.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{sit. relax. i promise you, at least one of us has done this before.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{this is not my first }
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{sssh. surprise me.}
<A>__{she starts massaging his shoulders, eliciting involuntary moans from him. bernie is almost in tears. nobody's touched him like this in years. and it shows. natalie takes bernie's glass, gulps down the remains herself, then sets it on the floor. she drops down next to bernie. starts kissing him. takes it slow.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{you're doing real good.}
<A>__{they fall back onto the mattress. natalie taking the reigns, maneuvering her hips, kicking off her panties... bernie gets an eyeful of a tattoo on her butt. a pair of dice. both twos. in seconds, natalie has separated bernie from his pants and underwear, taking him inside of her, ol' blue eyes keeping the rhythm... natalie moans uninhibitedly. surprise: she's a real screamer. moments later, we hear banging from the hooker's side of the wall. some john telling them to keep it down. bernie, with tears of elation in his eyes, thrusts away at natalie... for all of thirty seconds, before he explodes, convulsing in her arms with a stifled gasp. frank winds down "this town" a few seconds later. poor bernie, he didn't even make it through the song.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{sorry...}
<A>__{natalie wraps her arms around him.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{don't worry, bernie. i've had worse. we'll try again later.}
<A>__{bernie rests his head on her breasts. closes his eyes. we hold on him. a few seconds pass... and he breaks into a smile. fade to black.}
