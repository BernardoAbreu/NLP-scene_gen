<A>__{at first it's not clear what we're looking at, just blue sky. wind is very loud. the camera pans down to reveal we're five thousand feet in the air, in a clearing between two larger cloudbanks. the camera pans all the way down to show andrew's dangling feet, and below them, the impossibly far drop. we can hear andrew laugh.}

<A>__{we can see steve and matt, nearby, now wearing winter coats and hats to keep warm. they're playing catch with a football. steve tosses it to andrew, who actually goes into a short dive to catch it. he looks up to see steve and matt distantly cheering and waving their approval.}

<D>__{hey matt, you're finally good at something!}

<D>__{what? the wind!}
<C>__{steve }

<D>__{it's about aerodynamics! if i put a barrier just in front of me, i can go way faster, cause it cuts wind resistance!}
<C>__{steve }
<D>__{i can't hear a damn thing you're saying!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah! definitely!}
