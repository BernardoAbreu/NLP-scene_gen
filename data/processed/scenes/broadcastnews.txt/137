<A>__{jane's cab pulls up to the curb. she gets out she is carrying no luggage. she sees tom who hurriedly walks up to her. jane is fighting to maintain a calm.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{look who's the organized one. i've got everything.}
<A>__{he briefly opens a paper gift shop bag he is holding and shows her he has bought them each a bathing suit.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i'm not going.}
<A>__{he looks at her with anticipatory distaste evident on his face.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl. i know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.}
<A>__{tom half turns from her and moves back toward the bench. jane close behind, stalking him.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i felt funny about it afterwards. it's verboten, huh? i thought since i did it for real the first time but i get you. that's not the reason you're not coming?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(raising her voice)}
<D>__{of course it's the reason. it's terrible what you did.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{we disagree on how god awful it was. why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(livid)}
<D>__{jesus, if you're glib about this i'm going to lose it. i was up all night and...}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{jane, jane, jane, jane, jane...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{it made me ill. you could get fired for things like that.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i got promoted for things like that.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{working up tears for a new piece cutaway...you totally crossed the line between...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(distaste)}
<D>__{it just proves that the difference we have are...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this is a one way argument. we've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it we'll come home. if you don't go? well, that's a much bigger deal. i go to london right after that. so, it'd be very big deal if you stay here. the plane's boarding. you're good at deadline. here's your ticket.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(taking ticket)}
<D>__{it's amazing. you commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if i'm nitpicking. try and get this. when you edited that...}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(deliberately)}
<D>__{i'm leaving now. gate 43.}
<A>__{he simply turns and walks away looking back once as jane stands there mucked up by his sudden departure the lack of resolution to their confrontation is palpable.}
