<A>__{it's night. the loft is dark. carnby and aline are fast asleep on the bed, lying next to one another. carnby wakes up with a start. he tries to get his bearings. carnby looks surprised to see aline lying next to him. he quietly gets out of bed, letting her sleep. he pulls on a fresh shirt. carnby pads over to the lab area and turns on a desk light. he sees the wrapped items aline placed on his work station. carnby unwraps the items. they are the three abkani artifacts from the museum. carnby picks up the lynchpin artifact, turning it around. something catches his eye. carnby fiddles with the artifact. suddenly, the artifact telescopes out. instead of one thick ring, it is now three successively smaller rings, one piled on the other, with a common hollow middle. carnby picks up the large ring artifact. he slots it into place on the telescoped lynchpin artifact. next, carnby slots in the medium and small rings into place. the four pieces fit together perfectly, creating a cylindrical device with a small, round opening in the bottom.}
