<D>__{ i know what i ordered. i ordered "honey dawn" and you sent me "summer wheat".}
<A>__{jerome descends the staircase, taking the steps two at a time. he immediately goes to the refrigerator, removing trays of samples. eugene abruptly hangs up the phone.}

<D>__{call german.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{any particular reason?}
<C>__{jerome}

<D>__{we can't stay here.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{they think i offed the director.}
<A>__{eugene wheels himself over to jerome, unconcerned.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{what makes them think that?}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{they found my eyelash.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(a flicker of anxiety)}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{in a corridor.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(blase once again)}
<D>__{could be worse. they could have found it in your eye.}
<A>__{jerome half smiles despite the situation.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(resuming his collection of samples)}

<D>__{i'm not going anywhere. less than a week to go. not on your life }
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{ you don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again. we should cut our losses.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(angrily grabbing a tray from jerome's hands)}
<D>__{where is your head, jerome? you're acting like a guilty man. they won't marry the eyelash to you. they won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{they'll recognize me.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(scoffing)}
<D>__{how could they recognize you?}

<A>__{don't recognize you. anyway, you don't have a}
<D>__{choice. you run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now. no, we stick this out find out what we can but change nothing. this is a minor inconvenience is all it is. we've taken worse heat than this.}
<P>__{(angry now)}
<D>__{jesus, if i'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, i wouldn't have bothered. you can't quit on me now. i've put too much into this.}

<D>__{we'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.}
<A>__{jerome slumps down in a chair, eugene's tirade starting to get to him.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{and keep your lashes on your lids where they belong. how could you be so careless?}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<P>__{(reluctant admission)}
<D>__{i think i was crying.}
<A>__{eugene is uncomfortable at the notion.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{well save those tears.}
