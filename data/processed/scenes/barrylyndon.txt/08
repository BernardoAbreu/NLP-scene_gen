<L>__{exterior field day}
<A>__{dorothy, like a greyhound released from days of confinement, and given the freedom of the fields at last, runs at top speed, left and right, back and forth, returning every moment to roderick. she runs and runs until she is out of breath, and then laughs at the astonishment which keeps roderick motionless and staring at her. after catching her breath, and wiping her forehead, she challenges roderick to a race.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i accept, but i insist on a wager. the loser must do whatever the winner pleases.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{agreed.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{do you see the gate at the end of the field? the first to touch it will be the winner.}
<A>__{they line up together and start on a count of three. dorothy uses all her strength, but roderick holds back, and dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of him.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{i was certain to win, but i meant to lose to see what she would order me to do.}
<A>__{dorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty. then she goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes out and says:}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{your penalty is to find a cherry colored ribbon which i have hidden somewhere on my person. you are free to look for it anywhere you will, and i will think very little of you if you do not find it.}
<A>__{they sit down on the grass. roderick searches her pockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then her shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and circumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears upon the knee. he unfastens them and finds nothing; he draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits. the tickling makes her laugh.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i feel the ribbon.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{then you must get it.}
<A>__{roderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty breasts, over which his hand must pass to reach it.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{why are you shaking?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{with pleasure at finding the ribbon.}
