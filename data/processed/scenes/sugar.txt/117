<A>__{while jorge sleeps, miguel carves a small piece of wood with a swiss army knife. stops when he hears a burst of male and female voices coming from down the hall. he, goes to the door, listens... the drunken giggling voices get louder as they approach. miguel looks through the peephole, sees... ...brad and jeff with two local girls disappear into their room across the hall. miguel puts his ear to the door again, but can't hear anything, so he returns to the desk, begins carving again.}
