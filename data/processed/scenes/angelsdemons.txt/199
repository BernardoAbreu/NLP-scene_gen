<L>__{ext st. peter's square night}
<A>__{ the crowd in st. peter's square, in rapture. there is singing, there's chanting of the camerlengo's name. it's exactly midnight.}
<L>__{int sistine chapel night}
<A>__{in the sistine chapel, cardinal mortati is in hushed, urgent conversation with a group of seven or eight cardinals.}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{signores... you are no doubt aware that by holy law the man is ineligible for election to the papacy. he is not a cardinal, he is a priest, a chamberlain. and there is the matter of his inadequate age. i'm sorry, the protocols of conclave are not subject to modification. i will not call a ballot on this matter.}
<A>__{the african cardinal who cast his vote earlier speaks up.}
<C>__{african cardinal}
<D>__{but signore, you would not call the ballot. surely you remember you gave up your post as great elector.}
<A>__{mortati looks at him. boxed into a corner. outside, the crowd in st. peter's can be heard, singing joyously. a second cardinal steps forward.}
<C>__{second cardinal}
<D>__{they are singing in st. peter's square! what happened here tonight transcends our laws!}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{does it? is it god's will that we abandon reason and give ourselves over to frenzy? discard the rules of the church?}
<A>__{a third cardinal now, a peacemaker:}
<C>__{third cardinal}
<D>__{perhaps they need not be discarded.}
<A>__{they all look at him.}
<C>__{third cardinal }
<D>__{i am thinking now of romano pontifici eligendo, numero 63.}
<A>__{most of the cardinals look puzzled but mortati's face darkens.}
<C>__{third cardinal }
<D>__{balloting is not the only method by which a pope can be elected. there is another, more divine method.}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{"acclimation by adoration."}
<C>__{third cardinal}
<D>__{si, signore!}
<A>__{the second cardinal sparks to this idea.}
<C>__{second cardinal}
<D>__{of course!}
<P>__{(answering those around him who look confused)}
<D>__{election by adoration occurs when all the cardinals, as if by inspiration of the holy spirit, freely and spontaneously, unanimously and aloud, proclaim one individual's name.}
<C>__{third cardinal}
<D>__{and the law states that adoration supersedes all other eligibility requirements. the candidate need only be an ordained member of the clergy.}
<P>__{(dramatically)}
<D>__{but!}
<P>__{(they listen)}
<D>__{he must be present in the sistine chapel at the moment of election.}
<A>__{many cries now of "bring the camerlengo to us!" mortati looks deeply troubled.}
