<C>__{ted }
<D>__{...but a lot of cliches get to be cliches because they're true. your life can change in the blink of an eye. what i mean is, one day you're a regular chump, a wannabe something. you're not even totally sure what you wannabe...}

<D>__{uh, that's not me. i'm over here.}
<A>__{we swish pan to another teenager, locking his bike. meet our much less glamorous hero: ted nelson, 17. a decent looking kid. not hip enough to be cool. not square enough to be tormented. he joins the other kids heading into the school.}

<A>__{principal richard merkin, mid 50's, marches down the hallway, seizing copies of "exposed!" from students' hands. we can see that it is a "homemade" looking newspaper. and there's obviously much ado about it. christy winks at ted as she hides the newspaper in her locker. freeze frame on christy, winking.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{look at that smile. that wink. that's no platonic wink. that's a wink that says, "i don't just want you, ted. i need you." so of course i had to ask her to the prom. i mean, she was practically begging for it.}

<A>__{ted seems unaware that all eyes are upon him. the cacophony of the corridor settles. he gets down on one knee in front of christy. christy looks down on ted. smiles that smile. which freezes as her eyes dart. realizing that everyone is staring at them with great anticipation.}

<C>__{julie}
<D>__{being naked is no big deal. it has nothing to do with emotion, nothing to do with love. you can be around all the naked girls you want and you won't be even one step closer to anything meaningful in your life.}

<C>__{julie }

<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i wondered about them, for so many years. i wondered if i looked like them, acted like them. i wondered why they gave me up.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. when they founded "heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. all they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.}

<C>__{ted }
<D>__{the only man i called "dad" owns a little grocery store in xenia, ohio. he learned a lot of cool stuff from my grandpa, who was a peach farmer in his day. grandpa knew the right thing to say in every situation, and it usually involved peaches. my dad's a lot like him. and he taught me, you have to focus on the peachy side of life, not the pits.}
<A>__{dad's eyes are filled with tears. he's never been so proud.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{there was a time when canned peaches were the hottest, greatest thing ever invented. it was like a little taste of summer, anytime you wanted. grocery stores couldn't keep them in stock, they were so popular. and even though other canned fruits like pears, plums, and pineapples have come along, people still need to know they can get their canned peaches, on the same shelf, whenever they want them. it's comforting, you know? it fulfills their expectations.}
<A>__{the stockholders are listening. uncle billy grins nervously. unable to believe ted is pulling this off.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{you're probably wondering if there's a point to all this and i guess it's just that i goofed last month. i not only moved the canned peaches, i restocked the shelves with kiwi, guava, and mandarin oranges in heavy syrup. i challenged people's expectations. and you can't do that to your customers. so, i ask you for one more chance to fix things and give our readers back their canned peaches.}
<A>__{the stockholders applaud enthusiastically, giving ted a standing ovation. ted turns to uncle billy.}
