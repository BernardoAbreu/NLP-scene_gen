<A>__{bergin puts a hand on spooner's arm. knows he's not going to like this.}
<C>__{lt. bergin}
<D>__{del, we're going to have to reclassify the search. d.a.'s office is seeing this ns 2 as "missing evidence" not a homicide suspect.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{toller}
<D>__{homicide is the murder of a human being by another human being. therefore, a robot cannot be charged with "homicide."}

<D>__{wide spread panic. until that ns 2's found we're cooperating with u.s. robotics and keeping this investigation under wraps.}
<C>__{lt. bergin}
<D>__{maybe this isn't the case for you, del.}
<A>__{incensed, spooner replies a little louder than he intended.}
