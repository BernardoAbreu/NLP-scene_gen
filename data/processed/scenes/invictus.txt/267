<L>__{interior mandela's bedroom day}
<A>__{dark. curtains drawn. the door opens quietly. a shaft of light from the door shows mandela, on his back in bed, eyes closed. barbara enters. the sight of mandela lying like this is chilling. it is too close to what he would look like lying in a casket. barbara makes sure he is breathing. he is. she unplugs his phone, takes it. unplugs his tv. sweeps the room for papers, articles, legal briefs. for the first time, she takes an arm load of stuff away from him. she gives mandela one last, long look, closes the door behind her. we stay behind and look at mandela, and ponder south africa's fate if this were worse than just deep, sedated sleep.}
