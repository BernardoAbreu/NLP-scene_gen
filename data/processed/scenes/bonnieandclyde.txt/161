<A>__{c.w. driving alone. he is crying, mumbling, wiping his eyes and nose with one hand while he controls the wheel with the other.}
<L>__{exterior ring of firs. night.}
<A>__{a wide field in the country. this is dexter, iowa. it is quiet. we see, in a long shot that takes in everything, that this is a meadow surrounded by a ring of trees, a dense forest that circles them. the meadow, however, is large. the two cars drive into the middle of the field, headlights on. they stop and the barrow gang gets out. they are in horrible shape we can finally have a look at them. half dressed in their pajamas, bloody, dirty, in tatters. those that can stagger out do so, others are carried. a far shot of all this. closer shot. moving closer to them, we see clyde and c.w. lay buck down on the ground. clyde begins to administer to his wounds as best he can, mostly just wiping him off. buck is semi conscious. all are in a semi daze. blanche falls to her knees, still clutching her eyes. she is totally hysterical.}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{oh, god, please help us! dear father in heaven, get us out of this and buck will never do another bad thing in his life!}
<P>__{(she continues moaning, praying, sobbing)}
<A>__{bonnie walks over to the group, looking at buck, c.w. goes over to her. two shot bonnie and c.w.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{he ain't got a chance. half his head blown off.}
<A>__{camera pulls back to take in blanche.}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{my eyes!}
<P>__{(she screams)}
<D>__{god, i think i'm blind.}
<P>__{(in the headlights)}
<D>__{...light hurts so bad...}
<A>__{bonnie walks over to the car and comes back with the sunglasses buck had given blanche. moving her out of the glare, she helps blanche put them on. bonnie now has an arm around blanche, and blanche shivers into bonnie gracefully. bonnie is a little repelled by blanche, but comforts her out of genuine feeling for her.}
<C>__{blanche}
<P>__{(clinging)}
<D>__{please, please get us to a doctor! tell clyde to get us to a doctor. we'll die here.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(helping with glasses)}
<D>__{ here, hon'.}
<A>__{bonnie looks silently up to clyde. clyde is looking dumbly down at his mangled brother.}
<C>__{blanche}
<P>__{(going on)}
<D>__{clyde, clyde, please get us to a doctor.}
<A>__{though blanche cannot see it, clyde has knelt down to the side of buck, taking buck's hand and with his other hand has begun smoothing buck's hair back, away from the wound.}
<C>__{blanche}
<D>__{he's your brother!}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(gently, knowing}
<D>__{clyde will not and}
<P>__{cannot answer blanche)}
<D>__{buck can't be moved, now, hon'.}
<A>__{blanche's answer to this is hysterical sobbing, burying herself into bonnie, mumbling half coherent, muffled prayers between the sobs. with buck and clyde.}
<C>__{buck}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{clyde?...clyde?...}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{right here, boy.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{i believe i lost my shoes...maybe the dog hid 'em...}
<P>__{(he lapses into unconsciousness again)}
<A>__{clyde has begun to cry a little, continues to smooth back buck's hair with ritualistic regularity. wide angle. night. camera pulls away, way back to wide shot of the entire field, showing the group in the center of the darkness, lit by the headlights. match dissolve into early dawn, camera still on the wide shot. the field is lighter, though the trees still loom blackly around it. the two cars, one almost a shattered wreck, the other bright and shiny and new, are parked in the center. the sky is light, but the trees cast a dark shadow on the field. the gang is just sitting around. blanche weeping next to buck, c.w. sitting on the running board of a car, staring. bonnie standing and smoking. clyde still with buck. all is quiet.}
