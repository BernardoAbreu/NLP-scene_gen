<A>__{a body bag is carried through the crowd around the tenement doors. somerset follows. mills follows somerset. they walk towards the end of the filthy block.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i'm a little thrown. i just finished orientation at central, and they dumped me off down here.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i heard you brought in two small timers last night.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{yeah. two real idiots.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{since we are just starting out, i thought we could go to a bar. sit and talk for awhile. that way we can...}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{excuse me, but i'd rather start sniffing for a case, if it's all the same to you. seeing how we only have a week for this whole transition thing.}
<P>__{(waits)}
<D>__{i want to get into the shit a.s.a.p., know what i mean?}
<A>__{somerset walks, no reply. mills searches to get a read on him.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i meant to ask you something... when we spoke on the phone. i can't help wondering...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{why are you here?}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(wary)}
<D>__{i... i don't follow.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{all this effort you've gone through, to be transferred from philadelphia to here. it's the first question that pops into my head.}
<A>__{mills formulates his response.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i'm here for the same reasons as you, i guess. or... at least the same reasons you used to have for being here...}
<P>__{(cutting)}
<D>__{...before you decided to give up.}
<A>__{somerset stops and faces mills.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{you think you know me? you just met me two minutes ago.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{maybe i don't understand the question.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{it's very simple. you've come from the "city of brotherly love" to the "city of brotherly hate," detective. i've never seen it done that way.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe i thought i could do more good here than there.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you know, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right out kicking each other in the balls. but, you're calling the shots, lieutenant, so however you want it to go.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{let me tell you how i want this to go. i want you to look, and i want you to listen.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i wasn't standing around philly guarding the fucking liberty bell.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{but, you've never worked homicide in this city.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i realize that.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{well, please do me the favor of remembering it.}
<A>__{mills just stares back at somerset. somerset walks. mills rolls his eyes, looks to heaven like, "what'd i do to deserve this?" he follows somerset. insert title card}
