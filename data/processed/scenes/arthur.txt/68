<L>__{interior hobson's room. day}
<A>__{hobson's in bed, watching a discovery channel documentary about grizzly bears. arthur hits pause.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{put my bears back on, arthur.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{not until you answer my question.}
<A>__{hobson closes her eyes. she hams the next bit.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{i'm travelling down a white tunnel. to a garden? mother? father? why is it so hot? who's the red gentleman with the big pitchfork?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{will you cut it out?}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{arthur. there are three books. this is important. take them back to the library...}
<A>__{she feigns a melodramatic death.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{hobson, please. don't die any more. it's getting very boring.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{arthur. old women, like bears, get sore heads. are you okay? you look a little lost.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{naomi doesn't want to see me.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{a terrible shame she had to go. a little tart like that could have saved you a fortune in prostitutes.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{listen, old woman. don't ever talk about naomi that way again. what gives you the right to be such a snob? you're just...you're just... mary poppins with a menopause!}
<A>__{arthur storms out, slamming the door. but within 10 seconds he returns, humbled, ashamed a regretful naughty child.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{hobson, i've never raised my voice to you. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{i'm sorry too. you know, arthur, you may be growing up.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{do you want anything?}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{i want to be younger.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{sorry, it's your job to be older.}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{hobson. if you're feeling better tomorrow, will you accompany me somewhere?}
<A>__{she pats his hand gently.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{of course, arthur.}
