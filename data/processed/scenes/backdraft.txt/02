<L>__{interior fire station 17 day}
<A>__{the two boys tromp out of the closet. the rubber turn out boots are as high as their thighs. the ends of the coats drag on the floor. they salute, brian's arm just an empty sleeve. dennis kneels down and re fastens brian's coat.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{your brother's right. if you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{and die!}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{you wouldn't let me die, would you, dad?}
<C>__{dennis}

<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{dad!}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{you've come along a dozen times, stephen, give your brother a chance. we'll be back in a few minutes.}
