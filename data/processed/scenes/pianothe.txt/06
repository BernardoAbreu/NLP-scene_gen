<C>__{aunt morag}
<D>__{oh what happened?}
<A>__{morag looks over her shoulder as flora continues to talk, so persuasive is flora's storytelling that the scene comes vividly to life, albeit in flora's dark pupil.}
<C>__{flora}
<D>__{one day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. but so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... and at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! she never spoke another word.}
<C>__{aunt morag}
<D>__{ohhh ... dear. not another word from the shock, yes it would be.}
<A>__{the story is interrupted by the return of the wedding party who are dripping wet, exactly as the couple in the story. aunt morag bustles over to take off the wet wedding gown, her face puckered with tragedy.}

<D>__{terrible. terrible}
<A>__{before she can undo the ties ada pulls it from herself so aggressively that the ties and part of the gown comes apart. none of this is a concern to ada who is distracted with fear for her piano. she crosses to the little window and stares anxiously at the falling rain. sc 24 exterior beach dusk sc 24 soft piano music has been playing over the previous scene. now it builds to strength as sea water swirls high around the piano, small and embattled on the dark rainy beach. sc 23 interior stewart's hut bedroom day sc 25 it's morning of the next day. ada and flora sit amongst tea chests in the bedroom. ada is signing intently to flora. flora signs back, sometimes using words. stewart watches uneasy with their secret communication. as stewart enters the animation is suspended. ada stands and takes a step back as if to attention.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{i shall be gone for some days. there is some maori land i want and may buy very reasonably.}
<P>__{(stewart shuffles) i am hoping}
<D>__{you will use the time to settle in, and, in some ways we may start again}

<D>__{all right?}
<A>__{ada looks at him blankly, then nods. sc 26 exterior stewart's day sc 26 ada and flora dressed in cloaks and bonnets skirt the dense bush trying to find a path in. it is not easy, because the bush is so tight. ada's leg slides in up to her calf in mud. sc 27 exterior baines' day sc 27 ada and flora arrive at baines' rough hut. it is mid morning but baines is not yet dressed. ada hands him a note. baines looks at it blankly.}
