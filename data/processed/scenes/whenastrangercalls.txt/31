<L>__{interior office day}
<A>__{we see now the man who's been talking the director of the state hospital, dr. monk. he is sitting comfortably behind his desk; his jacket off, his tie loosened, his feet up on the desk. he is very matter of fact.}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{eventually, anyone will respond to the treatment here.}
<A>__{clifford sits down in front of the desk, picks up a folder and leafs through it.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{you gave him electric shock?}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{yeah, we zapped him a few times. it's fairly standard.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{it says here thirty eight... thirty eight times.}
<A>__{monk shrugs, then yawns expansively. he needn't justify himself to the layman.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{what will happen to him now, without the drugs he was on?}
<A>__{dr. monk's secretary enters the office and hands him a folder. without interrupting the delivery of his lines, monk takes the folder, opens it, initials something on the inside, closes the folder and hands it back to the secretary who turns and leaves the office without uttering a word.}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{there'll be some deterioration. that's inevitable, but we can't say how much.}
<A>__{pause. clifford looks at the doctor as if questioning his casual assessment of "some deterioration."}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{during the time that you had him here, did you discover any particular habits of his, peculiarities, quirks, anything that might help me find him?}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<P>__{(shrugging again)}
<D>__{it's all in the folder.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{any letters from people back in england? family?}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{that, too, is in the folder.}
<A>__{clifford directs a bleak look back down at the open folder, then looks up again, his eyes narrowing.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{let's get something straight here, doctor. i've been 33 years in the business of tracking people down and putting them away. i spent almost a year on curt duncan alone, with the trial, the testimonies, the background investigations. i didn't come here today to look in your goddamn folders. in fact, i wouldn't have come here at all if you'd done your job right.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{mr. clifford, this is a hospital, not a penitentiary. everything that pertains to one of our patients is meticulously recorded in that patient's folder... whether you can make sense of it or not.}
<A>__{they glare at each other for several seconds. monk is the first one to look away.}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{curt duncan is a classic paranoid schizophrenic. they see themselves as victims, and they always blame other people for the way they are. when duncan killed the mandrakis kids, it wasn't an act of hostility against the children but against their parents. he was getting back at his own parents for traumas he suffered in early childhood. the criminal side of curt duncan is one of terrible, symbolic vengeance.}
<C>__{clifford}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{assuming he isn't found right away... what will happen to him?}
<A>__{monk rises and walks to a window.}
<C>__{dr. monk}
<D>__{i think you'll find him. somebody will find him. he can't function out there. he'll make a mistake.}
<P>__{(turning to face clifford)}
<D>__{this is where he belongs. after six years in here, he's suddenly gone out to confront the world again. i think he's in for a bit of a shock.}
<A>__{monk looks back out the window.}
