<A>__{proceeding over a series of turns, inclines, declivities (according to location terrain). engines roar, brakes whinny, tires scream, skidding on the turns. another angle road bed as coley overtakes macreedy. he steers the big car within a foot or two of the jeep. the terrain has steepened; on the right there is nothing between the road and the valley floor far below but a few inches of soft shoulder. as macreedy pulls wide on a razor turn, coley tries to come inside him. macreedy, fighting for control of the veering jeep, succeeds in cutting him off.}
<B>__{curve in road}
<A>__{in the approach, coley cuts sharp into the jeep. the jeep seems to roll with the blow, then leaps ahead, maneuvering the turn. close shot coley in car (process) coley is flustered, his face blood shot with fury. he seems to generate an atmosphere of vicious, cruel craziness; the wild smile across his mouth is almost sensual, obscene. he floorboards the packard. like some monstrous battering ram, the heavy car smashes into the jeep's rear bumper, kicking the smaller vehicle jerkily ahead. coley floorboards the gas pedal, again. each time he slams into the jeep with sickening force, with the brutal abrasion of metal pounding metal. close shot macreedy (process) with one arm he works frantically to keep his under sized car on the twisty road. he sees ahead a precipitous cliff falling off on an impossibly sharp curve. he makes a decision... just ahead the gradient is comparatively gradual, however steep by normal standards. he swings the jeep off the road, onto the declivity. the car plunges downward, miraculously upright. macreedy jockeys it to a whirring, shuddering halt in the soft sand at the bottom of a draw. macreedy turns slightly and looks up the mountain side with the road at its summit... what he sees: extreme long shot coley standing at the edge of the road, peering down at him. in b.g., the packard. coley turns emphatically, gets into car, drives off.}

<A>__{his face is caked with the sweat of his exertions and dust kicked up by the grinding wheels. he exhales heavily and runs a shaky hand across the side of his head. he becomes aware suddenly of a noise, a trickling, an unmistakable tinkle as of running water. he frowns, opens the jeep door... medium shot jeep as macreedy unlatches the hood and throws it open. the noise continues. macreedy examines the engine and finds the difficulty... insert engine focal point: the nut joining the gas line with the carburetor has worked loose in the jouncing the car has taken. with his hand macreedy screws it tight. medium shot jeep as macreedy lowers the hood, re enters jeep. he turns on ignition. the engine fires. as he drives slowly out of the ravine...}
