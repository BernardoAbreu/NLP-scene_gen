<L>__{96: interior living room. house. night.}
<A>__{the whole house is going around in a haze of booze and colored lights and laughter. buddy holly supplies the music "true love ways" and ross is a victim of the nostalgia. dances close with margie. among the kaleidoscope of passing couples are helena & berlin. eyes closed and oblivious of everything but each other. but someone is staring at them. about forty years old with big hands. too old for acne but the skin is bad. got a scar on his cheek like a ladder in a stocking. he continues to stare until the dancers separate. music ends and he's already in the crowd. berlin arrives with a whisper for margie and next thing helena is on her arm heading for the stairs. obviously a "ladies room" run. everly brothers next record up and serato appears through the crush. spots ross who wants to know "what happened to you?"}
<C>__{serato}
<D>__{duty sergeant fucked up .. can you believe it, i'm on tonight ..}
<A>__{"how long have you got?" "one big drink." and they head for it.}
