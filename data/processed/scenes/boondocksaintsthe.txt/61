<L>__{interior rocco's apartment next morning 11:30 a.m.}
<A>__{the three are passed out all over the apartment. rocco awakens. he stumbles past the wall with the large, round, pink stain on it. there is a crooked picture hanging in the middle of it. rocco staggers to the kitchen and throws water in his face over a sinkful of dirty dishes. connor awakens, grabs his jacket and follows rocco out.}

<C>__{connor}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{listen. something's been bothering me about last night.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{think about it man. nine men, six bullets.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{you think they sold me out? no way.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{he probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. figure it out. shooter's dead on the scene. no in depth investigation. it'd slide right off his back. 'cause as much as i love ya, you're not exactly don corleone. what would he be losing? a thirty five year old delivery boy?}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{no, no. that's just not the way things are done. besides, how's he know i don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{he knows you, man. he knows all you want is to move up. that's all. a smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. but a guy like you? knowin' this is your only chance? waitin' eighteen years?}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{no. no man. that's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. that's bullshit. i know these guys. i mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.}
<C>__{connor}
