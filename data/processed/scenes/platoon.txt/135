<L>__{exterior perimeter #3 battalion lz dusk}
<A>__{at the lz, king runs out, gets on the last supply chopper with some other men. it lifts off, swirling dust, the last rays of daylight. chris watches from a battalion cp area, waves back the chopper sound receding in the horizon, the comparative silence of the jungle now creeping up on the perimeter. he turns and starts back to his foxhole. a man is watching him. he's sitting on a sandbag, face in shadow. it startles chris, something about him. something different. a deep west virginia drawl.}

<D>__{uh sure ...}
<A>__{goes over reluctantly, flicks his lighter, cupping it from the wind. the flame catches a sudden, uneasy expression in chris' face as he sees the smoking man. we come around and see what chris sees in the light of the flame. a face that smiles at him like a death's head, a large ugly blister on his mouth, whiskered, pale but smiling. a sick man wouldn't smile like this, but he is smiling too intimately, as if he knows chris from way back. but he doesn't. or does he? perhaps it was the man chris first saw at the airstrip when he came in country. the same expression of evil, of a man who has seen too much and died, but still lives. chris feels an unnatural fear passing through him. the man stands, sucking on his cigarette, stretches. he is thin and very tall, towering over chris.}

<D>__{... later.}
<A>__{he goes. chris watches him, wondering. the man never looks back, a leisurely, confident stroll. in that moment, there is an explosion from way out in the jungle, about a quarter of a mile. then another, then small arms fire. chris looks, knows.}
