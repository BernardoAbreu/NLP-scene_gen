<L>__{exterior space millennium falcon asteroid field}
<A>__{the falcon banks, makes a steep, twisting turn. in the next moment it is racing toward the star destroyer, looking very small against the massive surface of the imperial ship. as it moves across the surface of the star destroyer, the falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous flak bursts.}
<L>__{interior star destroyer, avenger bridge}
<A>__{the tiny falcon heads directly for the avenger's bridge. the imperials stationed there are stunned to see the small spaceship racing low across the hull, headed directly at the huge windows of the bridge area. alarms go off everywhere. the destroyer's commander, captain needa, can scarcely believe his eyes.}
<C>__{needa}
<D>__{they're moving to attack position! shields up!}
<A>__{needa and his men duck as the falcon nears the bridge window. at the last minute, the falcon veers off and out of sight. all is quiet.}
<C>__{needa}
<D>__{track them. they may come around for another pass.}
<C>__{tracking officer}
<D>__{captain needa, the ship no longer appears on our scopes.}
<C>__{needa}
<D>__{they can't have disappeared. no ship that small has a cloaking device.}
<C>__{tracking officer}
<D>__{well, there's no trace of them, sir.}
<C>__{communications officer}
<D>__{captain, lord vader demands an update on the pursuit.}
<C>__{needa}
<P>__{(drawing a breath)}
<D>__{get a shuttle ready. i shall assume full responsibility for losing them, and apologize to lord vader. meanwhile, continue to scan the area.}
<C>__{communications officer}
<D>__{yes, captain needa.}
