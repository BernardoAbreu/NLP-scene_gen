<L>__{exterior devon, england. a summer's day, 1912.}
<A>__{the bucolic magnificence of the devon countryside. we fly low over the high, thick hedges untouched for hundreds of years. the thick verdant countryside in all its splendor, ancient woodlands, fields of corn, and finally a paddock in a typical devonshire dale. we come to rest beside three farmers standing over a pregnant mare. the mare is in distress she is about to give birth. the farmers calm the mare and tend to her gently with assurance and authority. we pull back to see, albert, a fifteen year old farm boy, watching the whole drama with delight from the paddock gate.}
<C>__{farmer}
<D>__{come on, easy, girl. easy, girl. easy.}
<A>__{the men hold the mare firmly, but clearly this is a difficult birth.}
<C>__{farmer 2}
<D>__{this is a stubborn one, huh?}
<C>__{farmer 3}
<D>__{there we go. who's a clever girl?}
<A>__{moments later the summer's sun glints off the wet, sticky hide of the foal (joey) red hide, four white socks and a distinctive white cross on its forehead. soon the creature is attempting its first clumsy steps. it is both awesome and comical to see the new born creature struggle to his feet, but eventually, he succeeds. title: war horse}
<L>__{exterior paddock field, devon. various.}
<A>__{we follow joey's progress over the course of his first year. his initial fearfulness, his connection with his mother, the intimacy of their relationship. as joey gets strong they run together, frolicking gayly in the last dregs of summer. albert looking on. joey notices him at the fence and they share a moment of connection. spring: flowers are beginning to sprout by the hedgerows. our boy albert runs into the field. he takes an apple from his pocket he holds it out tentatively. joey approaches albert with suspicion. albert gently encourages him. his mother paws the ground and neighs at joey. he turns and runs over the field at her beck and call. albert tosses the apple to himself, ruefully watches in awe as joey races away with his mother. he is a magnificent one year old. his distinctive red coat gleaming, now it is clear that he is half thoroughbred. he runs quickly around the field enjoying his own power and strength. later the three farmers open the gate and come into the field. both joey and his mother instinctively canter over to the two men, expecting food. the three men gently greet the horses and pet them, then we see one man has a noose made of a rope. he slips it round mum's neck. she pulls back, joey is shaken and bewildered but before he knows what's happening the second farmer is trying to get a similar rope around his neck. joey balks and pushes the farmer aside, distressed to see his mother tethered. the farmer grabs joey again and struggles with him, enlisting the help of the second farmer. with some effort they get the rope around his neck and calm him down.}
<C>__{farmer 2}
<D>__{easy does it. easy does it. come on, steady does it.}
<A>__{unused to being tethered joey pulls at the rope but the farmers are solid and firm. they gently lead joey and his mother across the field to the gate and out into the road. the whole road becomes overtaken by a flock of sheep on their way to the market. in the distance we hear the bustle of market day.}
<L>__{exterior the market. the same.}
<A>__{the farmers lead joey and his mother through the chaos of the market and into an auction pen. they find themselves amongst a hoard of pigs, sheep and cows. joey is agog at all of these creatures and all this life he had no idea existed. the farmers lead the horses into a stall to await the auction. joey is bewildered by all the noise buttressed against a couple of mules and a cow. he is uncomfortable in this tight space. an auction worker holds a clipboard out for the lead farmer.}
<C>__{auction man 1}
<D>__{mornin', pop. put your mark here. good luck.}
<L>__{exterior joey's pen. the same.}
<A>__{two men approach the pen.}
<C>__{auction man 2}
<D>__{get the colt...}
<A>__{one man grabs joey and pulls him out of the pen. suddenly there is a look of horror on his face. his terrified mother realises they are being separated. joey panics and desperately tries to get back to his mother, he rises up throwing the man who is leading him aside. joey is out of control. the man regains control of joey.}
<C>__{auction man 3}
<D>__{whoa! whoa!}
<A>__{he pulls joey away from his mother, who lets out a heart rending cry, paws the ground, and crashes her foreleg against the fence. joey remains disoriented in the midst of the market day chaos.}
<C>__{auction man 3 }
<D>__{easy...}
<L>__{interior main auction ring. the same.}
<A>__{the auction ring is full of people of all shapes and sizes. there is a sense of celebration and busyness about market day. we concentrate on two men ted narracott (dad), in his forties, clearly both the cares of the world and alcohol have worn him down before his time, and si easton, his more solid friend, both working farmers. just behind si is his 15 year old son, andrew. ted has a drink in his hand. they all look at joey bridling against the men who are trying to hold him.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{now that's a beauty.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{forget it, ted. he's half thoroughbred and not got a day's work in him.}
<P>__{(points to a plow horse next to joey)}
<D>__{now, there... there's your ticket.}
<A>__{in contrast to joey, the solid and bulky plow horse stands like a rock. but dad remains fixated on joey.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{but look at him, si. look at that creature.}
<A>__{indeed, joey is magnificent, his power clearly emerging because of his upset.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{don't be daft. you need something solid to plow a field.}
<C>__{dad}
<P>__{(fixed on joey)}
<D>__{yeah, but he's something else, that one.}
<A>__{the auctioneer announces the start of the auction...}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{alright gentlemen settle down settle down horses on my right men with money in their pockets on my left it's the perfect combination. is fred goddard here?}
<A>__{fred shouts his reply from the crowd.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{yes! i's here.}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{good more money than sense. dave hill?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{i'm here. yes!}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{bugger off, you tight bastard you've been coming here for 20 years never bought so much as a pork scratching.}
<A>__{the crowd are loving all this. dad notices a figure across the ring, lyons, clearly a man of money. you can see something light up in dad's eyes a combination of dislike and alcohol. joey is led into the auction pen.}
<C>__{auctioneer }
<D>__{okay first up today a gorgeous young horse prettiest thing i've seen since my wife on our wedding day. let's get going, shall we? who wants this wonderful creature.}
<A>__{but no one bids.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{one guinea.}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{one guinea, one guinea, one guinea...}
<C>__{young andrew easton}
<D>__{i thought you needed a plow horse, mister narracott.}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{any advance on one guinea? any advance on one guinea?}
<A>__{joey is still trying to get back to his mother. a voice from the crowd pipes up:}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{two guineas.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{three!}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{ted narracott it's completely the wrong animal.}
<A>__{lyons whispers to his son, david, 15, next to him. david eyes joey skeptically.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{si easton i'm not gonna let that bastard see me off.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{five guineas.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{six!}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{oh for the love of...!}
<A>__{joey is straining to get to his mother, the men are pulling him back.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{seven.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{greedy sod thinks he can just buy anybody.}
<P>__{(bidding)}
<D>__{eight.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{stop it he's your landlord you can't be picking fights with him.}
<A>__{lyons looks over. there is now tension in the crowd as they sense a battle royal for the horse.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{ten guineas.}
<A>__{he smirks at dad.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{you haven't got the money. let's go home let's have a pinterior}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{eleven guineas, sir, from as good a man as any in this town.}
<A>__{they all look at lyons in his suit and bowler hat.}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{do i hear twelve guineas? twelve guineas?}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{that's top price for a workin' animal. ted! save it for the shire!}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{there are big days and there are small days. which will it be?}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{do i hear any advance on eleven guineas?}
<A>__{all eyes are on lyons and his son david is 15, smartly dressed.}
<C>__{david lyons}
<D>__{just let him go, dad, i don't care for him, he's too... jumpy.}
<A>__{lyons isn't listening to david; he's looking hard at ted.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{shall we say twenty five?}
<A>__{the crowd gasps. this is clearly personal.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{well, he's got you there. nice try, ted.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{you were great, mr n. gave him a run for his money.}
<A>__{but when he looks at ted, ted's eyes are locked into the eyes of his rival.}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{going, going...}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{thirty. thirty guineas!}
<A>__{total silence. he stares hard at lyons. who simply smiles, raises an eyebrow, tips his hat and walks away. it dawns on dad that he's won the auction. he breaks into a sweat.}
<C>__{auctioneer}
<D>__{thirty guineas. thirty guineas. going going gone to mister ted narracott.}
<A>__{he bangs his gavel. it's a done deal.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{what have you done, ted? what have you done?}
<A>__{dad doesn't acknowledge si. moments later ted stands staring at joey, who looks back. ted holds his reins numbly, accepts his receipt from the auction man in a kind of daze. suddenly, lyons appears at dad's shoulder.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{quite a beast, there. but what you gonna do with him on a working farm? i hope you got the rent, ted. i will be around for it when it comes due.}
<A>__{dad does not acknowledge lyons. lyons smiles and walks away with son david, and his cronies. si shakes his head at dad.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{you're a fool, ted. and our rosie'll never forgive you.}
<L>__{exterior narracott's farm. sunset.}
<A>__{mrs. narracott kneels in her garden, digging up some carrots, when she sees ted returning. dad walks down the hedged lane as the sun sets pulling joey with him, his bad leg always moving slightly to the side. mrs. narracott looks in horror and bewilderment at joey and then at dad. she is a good looking, intelligent woman, but clearly her life is always hard.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{what have you done?}
<A>__{dad stands shamefaced as albert the boy we have already met runs out of the house to join them.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{that's mooney's colt!}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{you were supposed to buy a plow horse.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{you bought him?}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{what'd you pay for him?}
<A>__{albert is totally taken by the horse.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott }
<D>__{how much, ted narracott?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i won't tell you a lie though i would love to. thirty guineas.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{thirty guineas!}
<A>__{she is stunned. she looks at ted and he just nods.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott }
<D>__{he's not worth ten! are you out of your mind? what about the rent?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{he's a strong one, rosie. look at the way he holds his head!}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{how the hell are we gonna pull anything with that? ted you have to take him back. you have to take him back right now now.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{you have to get down on your knees and beg for our money back.}
<A>__{joey bridles at the raised voices but albert takes the rope and tries to calm him.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{no. no, please don't take him back.}
<A>__{suddenly we see dad's dejection. he is a man lost.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{we can't take him back till he's broken in.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{and how are you gonna train a horse with that leg?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{i will train him.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{no, you stay out of this, albie. you don't know nothing about horses.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{please, mum. please let me. i can do it.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{we have to keep him. we've no choice.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{right. well... you've got one month to break him in or i'm taking him back myself.}
<P>__{(she turns to the house, but then...)}
<D>__{how did you get to thirty what other fool bid you up that high?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{it was lyons.}
<A>__{mrs. narracott turns back towards the house, then stops, dazed, speaking almost to herself.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{we're gonna lose everything. after all we've been through we're gonna lose it all.}
<A>__{she turns back to the others the weight of the mistake heavy on their shoulders but albert quickly steps forward.}
<C>__{albie}
<D>__{don't worry, mum i will raise him and i will raise him good.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{well, you better. go on get started. see if a child can undo what your fool of a father's done to this family of ours.}
<A>__{mrs. narracott storms into the house. albert immediately goes to stroke joey but the nervous horse draws back uncomfortably. dad leads him off, drunk and bewildered, across the yard to the barn.}
<L>__{exterior stables. later.}
<A>__{albert loads some oats into a bucket and approaches joey in the field.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{right. let's make a start then.}
<A>__{as albert approaches, joey nervously runs in circles, then stops on a dime, looking at albert suspiciously.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{it's oats. very tasty, that is. it's beef and gravy to us!}
<A>__{albert squats down. he shows the food. joey catches the scent on the air, but still hesitates and shies away.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{come on...}
<A>__{this time, albert takes a new tact, almost turning his body fully away from joey, but keeping the bucket extended. albert slowly backs towards joey, speaking gently all the while.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{i bet you're missing your mother. look at you... first time without your mum. first time away from home. but you're not alone, are you. in fact. cos i'm `ere...}
<A>__{feeling safer, joey moves toward the bucket of oats and starts to eat.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{it's alright. it's alright.}
<A>__{albert reaches out his hand and touches joey. and with a slight start, the horse relaxes into albert's hand, feeling safe with the boy. albert stares at the distinctive white cross on joey's forehead. joey calms.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{i'm gonna call you joey. understand? joey. that's you. and i'm albert. it's alright, you're mine now. you're mine.}
<A>__{albert strokes joey's forehead. joey lifts his head and the two stare at each other in close proximity.}
<L>__{exterior farmyard. next day.}
<A>__{dad, with a hangover, hobbles off to work the fields. as he reaches the gate, harold the goose snaps at his heels. dad dismisses him with a stare and heads for the stables.}
<L>__{exterior the farmyard, day.}
<A>__{the training episode: albert walks joey around the yard on the rope. it all seems to be going well. mum looks on. albert is clearly proud of his progress.}
<L>__{exterior paddock. another day.}
<A>__{albert's friend, andrew easton, sits on a rock with an apple in hand to watch the training. albert sets joey in a spot and tells him to wait.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{whoa. i want you to stay there, joey. stay. that's it. good boy. that's it, you've got it.}
<A>__{of course when albert walks away, joey follows. a game of "grandma's footsteps" ensues as albert patiently places joey then walks away.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{hey, look at him, albie. he's playing "grandma's footsteps."}
<A>__{albert patiently leads joey back to his starting position.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{right, come on, joey. back you go. come on. back you go.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{you're all right. that's it. good boy. right. you've gotta stay there, understand?}
<A>__{albert walks away again.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{that's it. good boy. you've got it. good boy.}
<A>__{finally joey stays put. andrew smiles, impressed.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{good boy. good.}
<P>__{(to albert)}
<D>__{now call him. whistle.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{come now, joey. come on.}
<A>__{albert whistles like an owl. joey stands completely still.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{you can come now, joey.}
<A>__{he whistles again. joey remains still.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{don't think he fancies your owls.}
<A>__{albert walks back to joey, frustrated.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{no, i read it in a story. it's how the indians used to summon their horses.}
<A>__{he gently strokes joey's nose.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{now, joey, when i whistle, you've gotta come, understand?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{my dad had a dog who stayed when you called him. he used to run up behind you when you weren't looking, and uh...}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{he's not a dog. he's just puzzling it through.}
<A>__{albert runs further away than before and whistles. after a moment, joey trots over to him. andrew smiles broadly.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{brilliant. look at you.}
<A>__{with the basis established, albert begins to train joey to react to the owl whistle without his prompting. it's not all easy going sometimes albert makes progress, sometimes not. quick montage mrs. narracott fills a bucket at the pump, then promptly spills it when joey trots past her in response to an owl whistle. she calls off, frustrated.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{albie.}
<A>__{dad heads out to the fields with a rake on his shoulder. there's an owl call and joey trots past him in the background. dad sees albert welcome joey by the haystacks, stroking his nose affectionately. dad walks on, his expression inscrutable. joey trots up a path, pursuing another owl call. after several more calls, he still can't spot albert, until he cranes his neck up and sees albert sitting in a nearby tree. albert laughs.}
<L>__{interior farm house. later.}
<A>__{lyons is there with his son, david, and his unlikable cronies. he holds a meager handful of cash. dad and mum look chastened. the mood is sombre.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{there's only fifteen here.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{the rest will come.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{you know by rights i could take this farm back today, don't you? and i'm a great believer in my rights.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{it will come.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{if you drank less beer and bought fewer horses you might be able to look your landlord in the eye, narracott.}
<A>__{lyons begins loading up his ledger into his bag.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i said i will pay you. we got to plant the bottom field.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{bottom field's rock hard. only stones down there.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{no, we're going to plow it. just give me `til the autumn. i will pay every penny i owe you. with interest.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{how you going to plow it? not with that fancy animal of yours?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{he'll do it.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{you'll not get that one in a harness, let alone pulling a plow. even drunk on a tuesday night, you know that. and i can't wait for the money there's a war coming.}
<A>__{dad stands up from his chair, resolute.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i promise you that field will be plowed. we'll plant it with turnips. and the money will be yours when harvest comes.}
<A>__{mrs. narracott interjects, desperate.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{please, sir. please.}
<A>__{lyons takes his time. he looks at them both ted and rosie, almost beaten.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{very well if that fancy plows that field i will give you till october to set things straight.}
<A>__{lyons heads for the door, but albert stands in his way.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{what if he doesn't?}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{i will take the horse on the day he fails.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<C>__{lyons }
<D>__{and i will take your father's farm and give it to working men who can hold their pints and hold their heads high in decent company.}
<A>__{lyons tries to move past, but albert grabs his arm.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{no, please. sir, you can't do that.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{now, now, now, lad. what are you bladdered as well?! ted narracott i got you down in my book!}
<A>__{albert knows he has to back down. lyons walks past him and leaves with david and his cronies.}
<L>__{exterior the narracott farm. the same.}
<A>__{harold the goose attacks lyons and his men. they quickly pile into his car and drive off. ted stands in the kitchen immobile with upset.}
<L>__{exterior stables. moments later.}
<A>__{dad throws open the stable door, jerks the harness from the wall, throws open joey's stall and starts to lunge at the horse. albert runs in to try to stop him.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{you can't harness him.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{he's got to be collared.}
<A>__{dad starts to grapple with joey desperately flailing in an attempt to get the harness onto joey. joey is completely confused and frightened.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{no, you can't. look, you're scaring him, dad. you're scaring him. he...}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{he can't take a plow!}
<A>__{joey tries to push dad out of the way, dad frustrated by this hits joey hard with the harness.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{he's got to plow!}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{he won't be able to do it he's too young he's not even been backed yet....}
<A>__{joey rears up and kicks dad. who falls to the ground.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{ted!}
<A>__{albert grabs joey's bridle. joey wrestles with albert.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{it's alright, boy. it's alright. it's alright. it's alright.}
<A>__{dad is mad with anger and frustration and in pain. he staggers to his feet and leaves. albert calms joey down. mrs. narracott returns the harness to its hook.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{i knew this would happen soon as i laid eyes on him....}
<A>__{but then she notices dad has returned. he has a gun.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott }
<D>__{ted. no. ted, no!}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{he's worth nothing to me! if he won't take the collar, he's not worth a damn thing!}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{he grabs the rifle, but dad shoves him away.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{move aside.}
<A>__{dad raises the rifle, but albert wrestles for it again.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{dad. stop.}
<A>__{furious with frustration dad throws albert to the ground and takes aim at the horse. mrs. narracott quickly pulls the gun aside.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{you shoot that horse we have nothing.}
<A>__{dad whips the gun back towards joey to find albert standing between them right in front of the gun's barrel. for a second we think albert will be inadvertently shot.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{dad pauses his finger just in time. albert gently holds the barrel of the gun. speaks calmly.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{you were right what you said, dad. "he'll do it," you told lyons, "he'll plow that field." and he will! you'll see. he'll show you. we'll show you. we'll get it done.}
<A>__{dad looks at him, frozen. mrs. narracott eases the gun away from him }
<C>__{mum}
<D>__{let go. let go.}
<A>__{ and hands it to albert, telling him }
<C>__{mum }
<D>__{go back to the house.}
<A>__{as albert leaves, ted takes out his flask. but rosie takes it from him gently. he doesn't resist.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{here, here. some days are best forgotten. today ain't one of them. come on.}
<A>__{they exit the stable together, leaving joey in his stall.}
<L>__{interior exterior stables. dawn.}
<A>__{albert walks towards the stables enters. and talks to joey as he prepares the harness.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{how are you today, joey? i don't know much about life, boy, but i do know that there are big days and there are small days. and most days are small days, and, well, they don't matter much to anyone but this well, this is a big one. this is our big day. well, it's cold out there. so i'm going to take this off }
<P>__{(he takes off his coat)}
<D>__{well, if it's tough for you it should be tough for me, too...}
<A>__{he is left in just a loose fitting white shirt....}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{now, i'm gonna teach you how to plow and you're gonna learn. is that understood? and then we can be together, which is how i believe things are meant to be.}
<A>__{joey instinctively balks, but albert is stern with him.}

<D>__{boy. steady, boy. here we go. here we go.}
<A>__{as he approaches joey with the harness, harold the goose enters the stable to watch. albert approaches gently and slowly puts the harness over his own neck and shoulders to demonstrate }
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{easy, easy... look at me, joey. see? see? you've just gotta put your nose through.}
<A>__{it is a moment between them. the horse looks albert in the eye, then yields. albert comforts him and show there is nothing to fear. finally he gets the harness in place.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{that's it. see? you've got it. you've got it. good boy. there...}
<A>__{harold honks his approval. albert leads joey out across the yard, through the broken gate.}
<L>__{exterior lower field. the same.}
<A>__{it is a grey day as they walk across the plowed fields towards the huge lower field. they come to a rusty, primitive plow left in the grass. albert looks around the field it is overgrown, it seems to go on forever even if joey was a plow horse this would be a heavy task. si easton and andrew stroll up the road to watch.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{too large, too rocky, matted with grass roots. even a sturdy plow horse'd never manage it alone.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{yet he will, i say.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{you'd swear he'd sprout wings and fly if albert had told you so.}
<P>__{(smiling at his son:)}
<D>__{it's a fine thing, loyal to your mate. even if he is a bit barmy. a team of two might manage, given a month and good weather.}
<A>__{they're interrupted by the honk of a horn as lyons and david pull up in a car. lyons and david get out. their driver remains inside.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{ted too squeamish to watch, is he?}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{`course he's watching.}
<A>__{si nods in the direction of the house. albert steadies joey and starts to tie on the heavy plow. it just seems too big and bulky for joey's sleek frame. albert sets joey right and fixes the plow. lyons, david, si, and andrew walk towards dad, who looks on anxiously from a nearby hedgerow. lyons gestures at david to stay back and walks over to ted alone. he stands beside him and begins to talk gently.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{well, you've raised him up a true narracott, ted, picture of his father, he is: not a dollop of ordinary sense but that thick stubbornness that'll lead him to insist on the impossible.}
<A>__{down in the field, albert continues to prep the plow.}
<C>__{lyons }
<D>__{wasn't a farmer in devon didn't admire you, myself among `em, leaving your brothers that fine farm and setting yourself at this stoney patch of unpromising ground. you've fettle enough for twenty men, but with a gimpy leg and the drinking for the pain, isn't it, that you drink?}
<C>__{lyons }
<D>__{ yeah, none of us could have anticipated an ending better than this. makes me question the wisdom of the charity that urged me to rent you this place, not only looking at you, me old pal, but that pretty little wife of yours, thought you were a spark, she did.}
<A>__{ted hasn't acknowledged lyons for a second; he's never taken his eyes off albert. he simply stands and walks away as}
<T>__{lyons concludes:}
<C>__{lyons }
<D>__{and now your son's sinking into the selfsame bog that's swallowing you.}
<A>__{albert has been meticulously preparing everything, positioning joey, checking the tethers, digging the rusty plow in the earth. he takes his position behind the plow, throwing the rear leather harness over his own neck.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{see joey i got the collar, too!}
<A>__{albert gently snaps the reins. joey doesn't move, confused by the whole affair.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{come on, boy. walk on. that's it. walk on! walk on, joey. come on, boy, walk on.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{you'd be better off startin' at the top of the hill and goin' down! gravity's the only friend you're gonna have today, young lad.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{walk on, joey! walk on! come on, joey, walk on. walk on, boy.}
<A>__{at the house, mrs. narracott opens an upstairs window to look on, anxiously. ted, standing alone by the fence, only looks at albert.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{walk on. come on, walk on.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(to himself:)}
<D>__{it'll take the whip to move him.}
<A>__{just as ted is saying this, albert, as if hearing his father, takes a breath and then abruptly produces a whip. joey's ears prick up. albert, grimly determined, snaps the whip at joey. joey panics and bolts. the plow spins to its side, pulls albert off his feet. joey drags them all the way to the top of the hill, right by the farmhouse. lyons, yelling, starts laughing and can't stop.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{bravo! you've reached the top of the hill! off you go again, boy! you'll make even better time comin' down!!}
<A>__{he continues past dad, laughing.}
<L>__{intercut :}
<A>__{ mrs. narracott looks on from the house. he glances back at her. her face is full of angry concern for their son. townsfolk begin arriving, climbing the hill to the lower field. ted looks down, ashamed. mrs. narracott looks back at albert, mortified, bruised, setting the plow right again. mrs. narracott moves away from the window, takes a seat, and picks up her knitting. later albert has made no progress. joey is moving, but only in a useless circle.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{good boy. good lad. good lad. now walk on. good boy.}
<A>__{more townsfolk clamor to the fence. andrew calls out.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{albie, we're all with ya!}
<A>__{albert tries to encourage him forward but joey still isn't pulling sufficiently. the plow skips uselessly over the surface stones.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{look look look! the plow hasn't even cut yet!}
<A>__{as albert struggles with the plow, he sees dad walking up the hill behind the spectators. he doesn't even turn to his son. joey strains as albert pushes with all his might. we sense the strain on the horse and the inappropriateness of the task. but joey perseveres. the plow limps along.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{do you know i believe we can do it, joey. i knew when i first saw you that you'd be the best of us. that's why he bought you. he knows you've all the courage he never had. i knew when i first saw you that you'd be the one who'd save us.}
<A>__{the plow skips and albert falls. joey's legs buckle and he goes to his knees. albert rushes to his side.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{whoa. whoa.}
<A>__{lyons calls from the crowd as rain starts to fall.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{you've got no chance, lad. he'll not turn over half an acre. give it up now. you've done well. you've tried hard. you're more of a man than your father.}
<A>__{albert examines the collar he sees it is ripping into joey's flesh. he grabs his shirt, tears a piece off it, tenderly folds it and puts it between joey's shoulder and the collar.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{come on now, mr. lyons, that's a bit rough, isn't it?}
<C>__{lyons}
<P>__{(a shrug:)}
<D>__{well, he'll destroy that horse.}
<A>__{the crowd's beginning to disperse. one of lyons' cronies holds his umbrella as he returns to his car. he passes ted.}
<C>__{lyons }
<D>__{i will be over thursday. give you a day to close it up.}
<A>__{mrs. narracott emerges from the house and heads to the fence holding her knitting in the rain, ignoring the leaving crowds. a sympathetic neighbor hands her:}
<C>__{neighbour}
<D>__{your wool.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, rosie.}
<A>__{lyons passes behind her, almost speaks, but then thinks better of it. as the rain intensifies, albert digs his toe into the wet soil and notices how it has softened. suddenly something flashes through albert's mind. he leaps into action, runs through the rain to shout at joey.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{now, boy! you've got to do it, joey. you don't know, so i'm gonna have to do the knowing for you when the rest of our lives depend on this! so get set to pull and pull straight! and pull hard!}
<A>__{he races back to the plow and sets himself.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{now, boy! go!}
<A>__{joey pulls firmly and finally the inertia is broken the rain has softened the earth.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{walk on, joey! walk on! that's it! good boy, joey! good boy!}
<A>__{finally, the plow bites deep into the soil.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{walk on! walk on! walk on! walk on, joey!}
<A>__{at the fence, mrs. narracott looks on in amazement. albert notices a large rock in their path. andrew sees it, too.}
<C>__{andrew }
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{go around it!!}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{whoa, joey! whoa, joey! joey! joey, whoa whoa whoa! joey, stop! you'll break the blade }
<A>__{albert hauls back on the reins, but joey throws his flanks forward, straining and lurching until the plow blade splits the rock completely in half and now the plow moves more easily through the wet ground. the ground yields. soon albert and joey are making great progress. the wet earth slipping open beneath them. andrew is loving it, speaks in wonder.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{will you look at you?}
<A>__{mrs. narracott looks very happy, a smile breaking slowly across her face... the crowd begins to return. lyons notices and looks out from his car sees the plow digging through the field. annoyed at the progress albert's making, he gets out of his car and walks over to mrs. narracott. with great disdain he}
<T>__{says:}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{i'd not let a child of mine slip in the mud alongside a plow blade. he could lose a foot!}
<A>__{mrs. narracott brandishes her knitting needles, backing him up.}
<C>__{rosie narracott}
<D>__{you'll likelier lose an eye, mr. lyons, if you carry on prating at me how to manage my son! or my plow, or my horse, or my field, or my farm!}
<A>__{dad sits nearby, watching this exchange with silent approval. lyons stares at her, gape mouthed, as she turns her attention back to albert.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{come on, albie! push on through!}
<A>__{the rain becomes torrential. lyons turns towards the car gestures, frustrated, to his driver, who runs forward with the umbrella to shield his boss from the rain. david remains on the running board, watching albert plowing. the plow speeds through the earth. the boy and the horse are working as one. it is a moment of triumph.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{get it done, albie! get it done!}
<A>__{we pull back to see they have made only the smallest dent in the enormous field. as lyons' car passes, dad steps forward, takes in the scene, and almost smiles.}
<L>__{exterior the lower field. evening.}
<A>__{the rain has abated. albert, soaked to the skin, sits next to joey. they are both covered in mud. andrew, followed by si easton, charges through the gate up to albert. they are lifting albert up between them, laughing, si easton planting a kiss on albert's muddy cheek, andrew tousling his filthy hair, when mrs. narracott arrives with ted. she helps si and andrew lift albert and slings her son's arm over her shoulder, glowing with pride, crying, overjoyed.}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{oh, my pair of fools. my mighty fools.}
<A>__{as the others help albert up, ted tends to joey. he looks over to his son and, after a moment, removes his cap and slightly bows his head. the others stagger away, supporting albert, and ted pats the horse and gently begins to unbuckle the harness.}
<L>__{interior stables. day.}
<A>__{albert washes joey and tends the wounds and sores on his body. rosie is putting antiseptic on albert's wrists and shoulders. joey bristles but is soothed by albert's care.}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{you're as battered and bloodied as he is.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{and where's dad?}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{still in the bottom field.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{stumbling about, i suppose.}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{it's not the drink, albert, that makes him stumble }
<C>__{albert}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{he drinks, mum.}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{well, so might you if you'd been where he's been, seen what he's seen!}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{well, he don't talk to me about it.}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{he don't talk about it because he can't. there aren't words for some things. come here...}
<A>__{rosie stalks over to a pile of broken equipment in a corner of the stables. she rummages until she finds a waterstained brown paper parcel tied with yarn. she brushes away some mouse turds.}
<C>__{rosie }
<D>__{the mice've been at it. sit down.}
<A>__{they sit together on a step. as she begins to untie the yarn, a change comes over her: her irritated determination gives way to sadness. albert comes to her and kneels beside her as she gently opens the paper. inside there's a red and tan pennant, knotted and fringed at both ends.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{here. it's his campaign pennant. he were sergeant, seventh battalion, imperial yeomanry.}
<A>__{then with great care she unfolds the sash to reveal two silver medals. the first, with the profile of victoria, hangs from a red, blue and orange ribbon.}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{and that is the queen's south africa medal. every man who fought in the boer war got one of those. but this...}
<A>__{she holds up the other medal, hanging from a red and black ribbon.}
<C>__{rosie }
<D>__{that's the distinguished conduct medal.}
<A>__{she hands albert the distinguished conduct medal. he takes it, astonished.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{not dad's?}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{well it ain't mine, dear. he got that after the fighting at transvaal. after he'd been hurt, and he'd saved some other lads, and well... i don't know what else, he won't tell me either. but the first day he got home he just... tossed them out. first day he could walk, he threw `em straight in the dustbin, and wouldn't hear a word i said not to.}
<A>__{albert nods, looking at the medal and campaign pennant. she takes the medal back, puts it in the sash, and begins to wrap it again.}
<C>__{rosie }
<D>__{see, what you done today, you and joey, you're chuffed up now, and so you should be, my splendid boy. it's good to be proud when you done something good. but what he done, in africa, whatever it was, he takes no pride in it. hard as it surely was, and however much pain it's cost him, he refuses to be proud of killing, i suppose.}
<A>__{she returns the things in the footlocker, closes it.}
<C>__{albert}
<P>__{(confused:)}
<D>__{i'd be proud. if i'd gone off to war. if i'd gone and saved my mates, and }
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{well, whether or not you think you'd do the same thing as him... think how brave he is for refusing to be proud.}
<A>__{she heads back to albert, pennant in hand.}
<C>__{rosie }
<D>__{oh, your dad makes mistakes. and he drinks to forget the mistakes that he's made but he never gave up and he does that for us. and today, you showed the world it's all been worth it.}
<A>__{as she leaves, she drapes the pennant over albert's shoulder.}
<C>__{rosie }
<D>__{you keep looking after joey and he'll always be looking after you.}
<A>__{albert looks again at the pennant.}
<C>__{albert}
<P>__{(softly:)}
<D>__{sergeant, seventh battalion, imperial yeomanry.}
<P>__{(amazed, to joey:)}
<D>__{you see this, joey? it's been through an entire war.}
<A>__{albert holds the pennant in wonder.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{i'm not stealing it. i will give it back to him, someday.}

<A>__{albert and joey are now in a meadow. they trot past the field he plowed, now packed with a strong and sturdy crop, which ted tends to. the sun is breaking through and joey starts to run across the field and up a small incline. as both joey and albert gain confidence they pick up speed. albert pushes joey on, they are going faster and faster, albert yells with the exhilaration of it all. joey races flat out across the countryside. albert hanging on for dear life. albert and joey pull up beside a sleek red car. it's lyons' car, being driven by david lyons, every inch the expensively tailored rural gentry.}

<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{is he a friend of yours?}
<A>__{she smiles at albert, encouraging him. david lyons, annoyed, pushes the accelerator down, and the car edges ahead of joey. but not for long. the sound of the acceleration and albert's eagerness to impress the young woman make joey go faster, and again he moves out ahead of the car. the young woman grins at albert. up ahead albert sees that the wall alongside of which he's been racing turns the corner, presenting him and joey with an obstacle. albert encourages joey to go faster.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{come on, boy, let's show her how to fly!}
<A>__{they head right for the wall, but at the very last moment, joey balks and comes to a dead standstill, sending albert sailing over the wall. back in the car, the girl gasps and covers her mouth, concerned. david says nothing, but allows himself a small smile. on the other side of the wall, albert stands a bit battered, but unfazed.}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{father signed me in. he knew my age and so do they.}
<A>__{the process of packing is their way of coping with the shock. gunther is folding one of michael's shirts. michael takes it back...}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{mother obviously never taught you how to fold a shirt.}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{of course she did. i just wasn't listening. but you need to listen now! i promised her, i made her a solemn promise, that you would be safe with me. with me, michael!!}
<A>__{he leans close to michael, talking in almost a whisper.}
<C>__{gunther }
<D>__{they'll never make a head count. there are too many of us. you can stay here slip underneath the bed until they move out.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{then what?}
<A>__{michael carries on with his packing.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{gunther, it will be fine. and when all the machines break down and they call up the horses, i will see you at the front. we'll be together again.}
<A>__{and now the case is packed. gunther heads to the tent opening.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{gunther...}
<A>__{looking round, the tent is now empty. the moment to leave has come. gunther pulls the red pennant from his pocket and follows michael out of the tent to where the soldiers are lining up in the road.}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{i'm giving this to you. for luck.}
<A>__{gunther ties the pennant to the back of michael's pack as he forms up.}
<C>__{gunther }
<D>__{to keep you safe.}
<A>__{michael smiles at him and begins to march. marching towards ypres, on the western front.}
<C>__{base camp officer}
<D>__{im schnellschritt! marsch...links! zwei, drei, vier!}
<A>__{we settle on young michael in line he passes gunther. he remains eager. but it is goodbye. these soldiers moving into the darkness and towards death. gunther looks on tears in his eyes. the two horses are uneasy sensing tension. a few minutes later gunther grabs a saddle and throws it onto joey's back. back to the soldiers. suddenly we see the galloping legs of two horses. they whip past the back of the line of marching soldiers. it's clear what is happening gunther is on topthorn and has hold of joey, on a loose rope, galloping beside him. gunther, galloping along the line of soldiers, spots what he is looking for, a red pennant unfurled and flapping in the wind, tied onto michael's pack. gunther speeds toward him. this was his plan all along. and in an instant he is beside him and without michael ever realizing, he suddenly finds his arms and legs akimbo, as he is yanked out of the line and dragged along the ground, desperately close to joey's pounding hooves. michael looks at the soldiers beside him he looks at the skyline of violence ahead...but before he can decide, he feels his brother's arm pulling him upwards. and now, the two of them are fully on topthorn. they leave a jumble of soldiers in their wake as the officers try to restore order.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{get back in line! line!}
<L>__{exterior woods. later.}
<A>__{michael now rides joey, following gunther on topthorn. the brothers look at each other can't believe what they have done michael is following his brother, swept along, doesn't know if it is right. and michael and joey and gunther and topthorn charge on to freedom. they spot a lonely house and burst past a line with some drying clothes. as they ride, they grab civilian shirts and jackets and trousers, the clothes pegs pinging off and falling to the ground. and on they ride though all too soon day starts to break in the far distance. they see a very dilapidated windmill. they aim for it as the sun begins to seriously break over the horizon.}
<L>__{interior exterior windmill. dawn.}
<A>__{they reach the windmill. it feels very unused. the machinery of the windmill creaks in the dawn. the brothers untether the horses, careful now that it is light outside.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm hungry. did you bring food?}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{michael fingers the pennant on joey's reins. then...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{will father be ashamed?}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{he will pretend to be. maybe at first he will be. but in the end, he will be glad.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{and us? what about us?}
<A>__{gunther looks at him but doesn't reply. as michael removes}
<D>__{joey's saddle:}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{i was ready to go. i was proud to go.}
<P>__{(after a beat, in a very small voice)}

<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what about the women?}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{not as good as the food.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{because...they've eaten too much of the food?}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{you are too young for war. and you're too young for women!}

<D>__{i don't feel so young. not anymore.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{michael.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{go to sleep we have a big night of riding ahead. goodnight, michael.}
<A>__{he jokingly strokes michael's cheek. michael swats him away, but as he settles in the hay:}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{night night, gunther.}
<L>__{exterior windmill. dusk.}
<A>__{gunther and michael sleep. suddenly something awakens joey. he stirs and then rises. hear the sound of engines and see lights through the slats sweeping across joey's face. michael and gunther are stirring in their sleep as we hear a car and several motorcycles approaching. head lamps filter through the cracks in the windmill walls stabbing the brothers awake.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{hei! in die windmuhle!}
<A>__{the boys spring up, speaking in terrified whispers.}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{go, go, go...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{they race up a nearby ladder, but michael stumbles against a table, upsetting some gear. it clatters loudly. they cower as they hear boots tromping up the steps outside. then the windmill doors are thrown open, pinning them in the bright headlights of the vehicles. as they're marched out, we see what they see: a german car two motorcycles. six germans, including the officer who was in charge of them.}
<C>__{base camp officer}
<D>__{schroeder.}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{base camp officer}
<D>__{a mistake?}

<L>__{interior windmill. night.}
<A>__{through the turning arms of the windmill, we glimpse the double execution. four rifles fire flashes of the soldiers shooting the bodies on the ground.}

<A>__{complete stillness in the empty countryside.}
<L>__{interior the windmill. day.}
<A>__{there are joey and topthorn, still waiting. and then suddenly the doors of the windmill creak. the two horses turn, immensely aware of the break in the silence. the door opens a little and we see, reflected in joey's eye, a very delicate, beautiful, thirteen year old country girl (emilie). she stares at the horses. they stare straight back at her. and she walks straight out again, closing the big door behind her. joey and topthorn settle for a moment. time transition joey and topthorn are in a slightly different place and the door opens again. it is the same little girl but this time she comes in carrying two buckets full of water.}
<L>__{interior exterior farmhouse farm. day.}
<A>__{a small humble farmhouse and round it, small fields, planted with different fruit crops. we see an old man (grandfather), burdened with a basket of berries heading back towards the farmhouse. a sound causes him to look out across the farm far in the distance the storm of war is in the sky. he enters the kitchen which is rough, but full of the paraphernalia of jam making jars, sieves, pectin, sugar. emilie is at the sink, washing berries.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{grandpere.}
<A>__{he heads towards the side board, dumps the two bags and lifts the first handful of fruits on to the counter. she empties her clean berries into a bowl. notes the explosions outside.}
<C>__{emilie }
<D>__{it's closer today.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{the wind plays tricks with the noise it's moving away from us.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{i can hear it, grandpere, and there is no wind. you shouldn't lie to me.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{here. there is no wind here. but over there a wind so strong it will lift you off the ground...}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{you lie about everything. you say you aren't worried but it's clear you are. i know the war is approaching but you say, "oh, it's just a trick of the wind."}
<A>__{he retrieves a bottle of medicine from the mantle.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{did i say that?}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{you started lying when mama and papa went away.}
<A>__{she pours a load of sugar into a bowl with the fruit.}
<C>__{emilie }
<D>__{they're dead. but you won't say so. do you think i will die if you tell me the truth?}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{the truth is }
<A>__{he feeds her a spoonful of the medicine.}
<C>__{grandfather }
<D>__{ you should speak to your elders with respect.}
<A>__{she sticks her wet finger in the sugar and sucks it to help with the taste of the medicine.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{if you tell me the truth about the war, i will tell you the truth about the big horses i've been keeping in the windmill.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<P>__{(standing, putting his hands on his hips)}
<D>__{now who is the one telling lies!}
<L>__{exterior courtyard. same.}

<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{in the windmill?}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{yes. they were standing in the windmill waiting for don quixote. this is francois (joey) and this is claude (topthorn).}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{i named them after two boys who broke my heart last summer.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{they must belong to someone. horses like this don't just appear from a fairy tale.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{yes i know, grandpere. they are not unicorns so i will be fair and wait one day.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{emilie... emilie...}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{and if no one comes to get them by night time, then they belong to me.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{emilie. look at me. you cannot ride.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{mother used to tell me how my bones would give way with the slightest bump or fall.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{yes. that's right. so it is settled?}
<A>__{she kisses his cheek }
<C>__{grandfather }
<D>__{good girl.}
<A>__{ but then calmly leads the horses back to the windmill.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{it will only be settled when i decide which one to ride first.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{but it's over my dead body!}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{at least i won't have long to wait.}
<A>__{that is the end of the conversation as far as she is concerned.}
<L>__{exterior farm house. day.}
<A>__{emilie is with the horses in the little stable at the end of the courtyard a bit away from the farm house she is feeding them out of a bucket not very nice gruel.... we see that she is hesitant with them that she has spent no time around horses.}
<C>__{emilie}
<P>__{(to joey)}
<D>__{i was in love with a boy called francois who had your lovely eyes.}
<P>__{(to claude)}
<D>__{unfortunately he was in love with a girl called marie, who had your teeth. she fell for a boy called claude who broke my heart. and who i intend to marry one day.}
<L>__{interior exterior field in front of farmhouse. day.}
<A>__{grandfather watches emilie from inside the house as he makes jam.}
<C>__{emilie }
<D>__{eyes on me. no talking.}
<A>__{outside, emilie has fashioned two jumps. the big one for joey and a little demonstration obstacle for herself. she leads joey to a starting point about 30 yards in front of some crates supporting a stick about four feet off the ground. the red pennant hangs from the stick. joey stands quietly as emilie hobbles to the big jump, making a jumping gesture with her hand.}
<C>__{emilie }
<D>__{today we learn to jump. did you know the french cleared one meter eighty five at the paris olympics to win the gold medal? today we will beat that record.}
<A>__{grandfather chuckles. emilie indicates the larger barrier.}
<C>__{emilie }
<D>__{this is your jump. when i call you....be very brave and leap over it.}
<A>__{she claps, but joey doesn't move.}
<C>__{emilie }
<D>__{leap over it! watch me.}
<A>__{she turns to her demonstration jump and easily steps over her six inch high barrier.}
<C>__{emilie }
<D>__{and now it's your }
<A>__{she turns to find joey already stepping over her mini jump, stopping in front of her. he's only interested in the apple in her hand. she takes a bite herself.}
<T>__{jump to:}
<A>__{emilie returns joey to the starting line and runs back behind the big jump. from behind her back she produces three big carrots dripping soil. joey's ears perk and he takes off quickly but at the last moment veers right and passes between the two jumps.}
<L>__{interior farmhouse. day.}
<A>__{grandfather is watching through the window as he prepares his strawberry jams. he laughs and goes back to work.}
<B>__{back to field}
<A>__{aware she's being watched, she slings the carrots over her shoulder, frustrated.}
<T>__{jump to:}
<L>__{exterior barn. later.}
<A>__{joey slowly emerges from the barn with emilie out in front leading him with one hand. in the other hand, she carries a small wooden step ladder.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{he doesn't think we can do it. but we will show him, won't we?}
<A>__{emilie unfolds the ladder beside joey and shakily starts climbing to the top of it.}
<C>__{emilie }
<P>__{(her voice shaking)}
<D>__{no need to be afraid.}
<P>__{(emilie looking down at}
<D>__{how far off the ground}
<P>__{she is)}
<D>__{you are...very tall.}
<A>__{before she can swing her leg over joey's back }
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{you'll kill yourself.}
<A>__{emilie turns, and there, blocking the hurdle, now standing hands on hips, is grandfather.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{only if you get in my way to make me fall.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{oh please, come off the ladd }
<A>__{a sound from far down the road. grandfather looks. emilie turns to look too. two trucks led by a german motorcycle are approaching the farm.}
<C>__{grandfather }
<D>__{find somewhere to hide them. and do it quickly!!!}
<A>__{as emilie races off with the horses, grandfather pushes over the jumps and jams the pennant into his pocket. the bikes arrive first, just missing emilie as she leads the horses behind the house. the trucks arrive, pull round one of the soldiers in the front jumps out and opens the back.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{halt! und aussteigen!}
<A>__{the people 20 of them, all seeming to be poor french peasants, mainly women, move out of the truck. as they walk past, they avoid the eye of the grandfather, who approaches the soldiers.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{my name is bonnard this is my land. why are you here?}
<C>__{soldiers}
<D>__{food for the soldiers at the front. everyone must give their share.}
<A>__{and suddenly we see what is going to happen the 20 peasants spread out and move through the field with either bags, or using the aprons they wear picking all the fruits at just the moment all the work has brought forth fruit and the new year's crop is ready. raspberries, black currants, gooseberries. in a few minutes, everything he lives by will be gone. watching from his car and calmly smoking a cigar is brandt, the officer in charge of the unit. cut to the fields the aprons and baskets are getting full. they move through the rows of fruit like a plague of locusts. back to the grandfather and out of the house comes emilie.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{they are taking everything. where are the horses?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{what horses?}
<A>__{the sound of jars breaking draws grandfather and emilie into the kitchen, where the germans continue to raid their other supplies. one german picks up waterbath canner inspecting it.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{leave it if you don't know what it's for.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{a pot is a pot. we'll find some use for it. sir, where's the livestock?}
<A>__{brandt sits quietly, casually using his finger to scoop jam from an open jar.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{i make jam. we have no animals.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{but there's fresh hay in your barn.}
<A>__{emilie enters, overhearing.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{we use it to replace the mattress stuffings.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{her grandfather?}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{where are her parents?}
<C>__{emilie}
<P>__{(breaking in)}
<D>__{they're dead. they died.}
<A>__{the german nods and is about to take his leave, putting the pot back where he found it, when a clumping noise from somewhere in the house begins.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{the wind. it plays tricks in the attic.}
<A>__{brandt licks his finger and tests:}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{there is no wind.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{an old house creaks.}
<P>__{(to emilie)}
<D>__{go close the shutters.}
<A>__{emilie runs out of the room. the soldier picks up the medicine bottle.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{she's sickly, no?}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{if you or any of your friends harm her, as old as i am, i will kill you.}
<A>__{the soldier looks shocked and then begins to laugh. he slaps the medicine flask into grandfather's chest.}
<C>__{german soldier}
<D>__{you know, i was going to give you back your pot. but now i'm going to keep it. for soup.}
<A>__{he slings the huge pot he had put back up on his shoulder and leaves the house with the other soldiers.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{we will be back in the new season.}
<A>__{as the germans leave, we cut to the upstairs bedroom where emilie lies curled up on the bed and there, standing on either side of the bed are the two horses. they look huge in the tiny room.}
<L>__{interior kitchen. late that night.}
<A>__{the sound of shells exploding. a huge bombardment somewhere in the deep distance. but much closer than before. the distant, malicious giants of war growl. it is like a lightning storm on the horizon. the kitchen has been emptied. the war has finally come to them and we can see it on emilie's face.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{tell me what happened to them. to my mother and father.}
<A>__{grandfather doesn't respond.}
<C>__{emilie }
<D>__{you said you would tell me how they died. on my birthday. and tomorrow's my birthday! they died fighting, didn't they? but when the soldiers come }
<A>__{she finally turns to face him.}
<C>__{emilie }
<D>__{ you do nothing. you are a coward, aren't you?}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{yes. yes. it was your parents who were brave. i make jams.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{and you've never done a brave thing in your life?}
<A>__{he eases himself into a chair and shrugs.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{maybe there are different ways to be brave. did you know the french have the best carrier pigeons? and this could be the difference in the war our messages getting through.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{i don't want to hear about the birds.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{they are released at the front and told to go home this is all they know. but to get there they must fly over a war. can you imagine such a thing? here you are flying over so much pain and terror and you know you can never look down. you have to look forward or you'll never get home. i ask you what could be braver than that?}
<A>__{emilie sheds a single tear.}
<L>__{interior the barn. dawn.}
<A>__{grandfather enters the barn, strokes topthorn's nose as he passes. he sweeps aside a rug from the barn floor, to reveal a trap door. then, he opens it. now from out of the trap door, he lifts a big ungainly object, covered in another rug.}
<L>__{interior farmhouse kitchen. morning.}
<A>__{emilie comes down the stairs as grandfather waits proudly by the stove. she stops when she sees the object covered by the}

<D>__{a present.}

<C>__{grandfather}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{it was disgusting?}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{yes. i looked like an ugly nun.}
<A>__{then she stops herself and turns to grandfather with a parental rebuke.}
<C>__{emilie }
<D>__{give me your hand.}
<P>__{(she takes it in hers)}
<D>__{grandpere, we have no money. when the war is over, then you can buy me jewels and carriages.}
<A>__{the grandfather smiles and gives emily a hug.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{anything you say, my sweet one. anything you say! you are, of course, the boss. it's just an old thing i found don't worry yourself leave it, i will put it back.}
<A>__{he leaves the room. now emilie is alone and she can't help it when she brings her eyes back to the object covered by the rug. she looks back over her shoulder to make sure she's not being watched and then lifts one corner of the rug. her face explodes with a gorgeous smile. she pulls off the rug that is covering the big thing and...it is a gorgeous old saddle. she runs her hand along the saddle can hardly believe it.}
<L>__{interior a hill. just beyond the farmhouse. near the windmill.}
<B>__{day.}
<A>__{grandfather helps to swing emilie up and into the saddle. all at once, the grandfather's charity evaporates.}

<A>__{he holds out the wire cutters. the geordie, still frightened, stares stupidly at them.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{for the barbed wire?}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{yeah, yeah i... ummm, thanks. cheers. cheers...}
<A>__{he reaches out and takes the proffered cutters.}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he returns to joey, nervous about turning his back. he tries to figure out where to begin cutting. he lifts a long strand of wire that wraps around joey's neck, stretches across his shoulder and torso and around one of his front legs. he puts the wire in the crux of the cutters and is preparing to snip when peter steps closer to him.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{that...that's a very long strand. when you cut it, it's going to release this }
<A>__{he points to a wire wrapped around the wire the geordie's lifting. then he points to two other wires, similarly}
<T>__{entangled:}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{ and this, and this, and they'll coil back rather violently, which i'm afraid will only wound the poor fellow further.}
<A>__{the geordie nods.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{you speak good english.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i speak english well.}
<P>__{(re: the cutters)}
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{the geordie hands them over and peter surveys the wires.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{what if we cut his head free first? so he won't try to stand up and blind himself? and then }
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{pity you didn't bring a second pair. then i could cut the wire here }
<A>__{he points to one of the wires entangled with the strand he'd been prepared to cut. peter stands and shouts in the direction of his trench.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we need more wire cutters!}
<A>__{all at once one, two, three, six pairs of cutters come soaring through the air and splash into the watery crater. moments later peter and the geordie kneel beside joey, each with a pair of cutters. joey is calming down again. the geordie positions himself across joey's body so that when he's cut the wire, it won't coil back and cut joey. peter positions himself to be able to cut the two wires in quick succession, holding the first wire to stop it from springing back. joey's completely still now. peter points between joey's eyes.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{his blind spot. the cutters won't frighten him. if you could cut here, holding this wire }
<A>__{he points to wires that intersect the wire that crosses joey's eye. then he points to the wire across joey's eye.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{i could }
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{say no more, i'm right behind you.}
<A>__{as they reposition themselves, the geordie says to joey:}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{and you understand what's happening, do you not, o best beloved? that you must lay so very nice and still. there's a lad, you're a remarkable horse, you are, helping us help you. there's a lad. there's a remarkable lad.}
<A>__{the geordie looks into joey's huge eye as he and peter get to work on their cutting. joey returns his gaze.}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{so how's things in yonder trench?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{delightful. we read, we knit sweaters, and we train our rats to perform circus tricks.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{well, if ever you need any more rats, we can always send ours over. `cause we've more than we need, strictly speaking. besides, they scare off all the pretty girls.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{our girls aren't afraid of rats.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{big strapping german girls, eh? kind what gives robust massages?}
<A>__{they laugh.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{every thursday! and they bring rum cake on your birthday.}
<A>__{both men smile at this while joey is completely still; they work quickly, in concert, cutting the horse's head free of the wire. joey raises his head, gives it a shake, neighs and then stirs a little. the two soldiers smile at one another. then they set about cutting the rest of the wire; it's much easier now. the geordie cuts through the last wire binding joey's legs. the two soldiers help as the horse staggers upright.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{look at that horse! look at the muscles he's got, them long legs. they're made for running, horses. runnin' away from danger.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{running away is all they have.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{yet we taught `em opposite. running into the fray.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{war horse.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{yeah. war horse. and there he is. what a strange beast you've become.}
<A>__{the geordie grabs hold of joey's halter, though joey shows no sign of running. joey is finally free. the two men look at each other.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{and now?}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{i take him back with me, yeah?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{since i supplied the cutters, the horse is mine. this is fair, no?}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{in a pig's eye. he's english, plain to see.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh, you mean because he's so filthy?}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{because he's so smart. and you're none too clean yourself.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we could box. and the winner gets the horse.}
<A>__{the geordie smiles.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{no, thanks, pet. must be careful not to start a war.}
<P>__{(patting his pockets:)}
<D>__{do you have a coin of any sort?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{coin toss?}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he takes a coin from his pocket, hands it to the geordie, who looks at it.}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{all right, fritz you're on.}
<A>__{he flips the coin back to peter.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{my name is not fritz it is peter.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{peter i'm colin.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you call it, colin.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{heads.}
<A>__{peter spins it in the air and lets it fall into the mud. they look down. peter shakes his head, resigned.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{that's the face of my kaiser and he does not look pleased with me. the horse is yours.}
<A>__{they collect their helmets as snow begins to blow around them.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{gone quiet, hasn't it?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{but wait half an hour and we'll be shooting again.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{i'm a terrible shot, pete, don't believe i will ever hit the target.}
<A>__{he hands back the cutters.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he notices the geordie has offered his hand, as well. a beat, then peter shakes with him.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{cheerio, mate.}
<P>__{(re joey:)}
<D>__{you'll take good care of him, yes?}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{i will.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{our strange beast.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{and you take care of your own strange self.}
<A>__{peter tosses geordie his cutters.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{colin! a pair of german cutters in memory of your handsome friend from dusseldorf.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{peter nods, and walks back to his trench. as he goes, the geordie calls after him:}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{i will use `em back in the garden in south shields. you keep your head down, now, pete me lad!}
<A>__{as he walks away, peter turns back briefly, calling:}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{remarkable! a remarkable horse!}
<A>__{the geordie leads joey towards the british trenches.}
<L>__{exterior trenches. the same.}
<A>__{joey is now in the trenches, splashing about in the ankle deep water. he seems enormous in this cramped labyrinth. he is led past the broken and wounded soldiers who look at him with amazement, dumbfounded. it is a surreal image. the horse where horses shouldn't be. as joey makes his journey through the trenches soldiers excitedly gather to watch him come by, taking pleasure in the saving of this single life.}
<L>__{exterior trenches. the same.}
<A>__{we arrive at a section we recognise as the place from where albert set off only the night before. sergeant martin is there as one man helps a wounded soldier into a medical area. it is david, hobbling and looking shell shocked. another wounded soldier approaches, but martin waves him on.}
<C>__{sergeant martin}
<D>__{we're full up. move on.}
<A>__{david is seated next to albert, who now seems in worse condition. his eyes are bandaged and he's wheezing. andrew is nowhere to be seen. as a medical officer checks albert:.}

<D>__{the gas got him we had to wait till morning.}
<A>__{the medic moves to sergeant martin, looking stricken.}

<L>__{exterior hospital area. later.}
<A>__{joey is led into the hospital area beyond the trenches. the geordie leads him through the snowy streets. bandaged men strewn around, wounded soldiers waiting for attention. the waiting soldiers gather to view the strange spectacle of the horse. at one of the dressing areas, a nurse tends to albert's damaged eyes. behind him, we see joey pass in the street, but albert doesn't know it. joey limps, his foreleg clearly injured. the geordie soldier stops outside a makeshift hospital. joey looks frail and exhausted. a doctor storms over from his patients.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{what's this doing here?}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{we need a vet, sir.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{there are no vets. we've scarcely any horses left.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{he's cut all over, but this leg here's got the worst of it.}
<A>__{geordie strokes joey as the doctor examines him.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{it's probably tetanus. it's no good.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{please, sir }

<D>__{i've all these men to take care of, corporal, you can see that, can't you?}

<D>__{it's a horse they found, wandering about in no man's land.}
<P>__{(easing him back onto a cot)}
<D>__{down you go.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{what kind of an horse?}
<C>__{an orderly}
<D>__{bloody miraculous kind of an horse, be my guess. nothing makes it out of no man's land.}

<D>__{miraculous horse...}
<L>__{exterior hospital area. same.}
<A>__{joey stands breathing very deeply. the doctor touches his wounded leg. the men from all over the medical area gather around joey concerned about their new hero's pain. the doctor looks at the geordie and frowns shaking his head "no."}

<P>__{(to the doctor:)}
<D>__{he was alive, y'see, sir, where nothing survives, so to me and me mates, to the men, sir, he's well, we have high hopes for him }

<A>__{the doctor sadly addresses a nearby sergeant.}
<C>__{doctor }
<D>__{sergeant. put him out of his misery.}
<A>__{the doctor nods his head towards joey. the sergeant, sergeant fry, takes his gun from his holster, checks that it's loaded. he turns to some nearby nurses, urging them away.}
<C>__{sergeant fry}
<D>__{ladies, if you please.}
<A>__{total silence from the crowd who have gathered. they thought they were there to see something wonderful. and now they find that they've gathered for an execution but can't take their eyes off it. the sergeant waves them back.}
<C>__{sergeant fry }
<D>__{all right, back off. back off.}
<A>__{the geordie is the last to step away from joey. the sergeant draws breath before he steps forward to take aim. joey is totally still, sensing the atmosphere. the sergeant cocks his pistol. suddenly there is a strange owl like whistle from fifty yards away. joey looks around startled. the sergeant turns joey's head back around, raises his pistol once more. then, the whistle again. even the doctor notices this time. joey turns. slowly, the crowd parts another owl whistle and we see albert, his eyes bandaged walking forward blindly guided by the hands of the crowd. one soldier urges albert gently.}

<D>__{go on. do it again.}
<A>__{one more whistle.}
<C>__{albert}

<P>__{(to the geordie:)}
<D>__{do you know this man?}
<A>__{the geordie shakes his head, no. the doctor speaks to albert, gently; clearly he thinks he's dealing with a traumatized, possibly crazy soldier.}

<D>__{wait! you can't see `cause of the mud.}

<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{four white socks!}
<A>__{the doctor takes a rag himself and wipes joey's snout, revealing the white diamond mark. the sergeant takes this in...and holsters his pistol.}

<A>__{suddenly, we are back in the village in devon, in the fold of the valley. dusk light. a figure approaches, silhouetted against the setting sun. mrs. naracott gathers the harvest, then notices as the figure makes its way up the road to the farm. a man in uniform. on a magnificent horse. mrs. narracott meets them at the gate and we can finally see them clearly albert and joey. albert dismounts and removes his cap. an instant later, mrs. narracott is hugging him for all that her life is worth.}

<A>__{ted sees them and makes his way to the field gate...shaky. albert approaches, and stops a slight distance away. ted opens the gate to stand before his son. albert slips something from his pocket and lets it unfurl in his hand ted's campaign pennant. ted accepts it quietly, then offers his hand to albert. they shake, as men. and then slowly embrace, as father and son. mrs. narracott joins them as joey looks on a small family and a beautiful horse, finally home.}
