<P>__{(to the doctor)}
<D>__{he's been depressed. all off a sudden, he can't do anything.}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{why are you depressed, alvy?}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(nudging alvy)}

<P>__{(his head still down)}
<D>__{the universe is expanding.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{the universe is expanding?}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(looking up at the doctor)}
<D>__{well, the universe is everything, and if it's expanding, someday it will break apart and that would be the end of everything!}
<A>__{disgusted, his mother looks at him.}
<C>__{mother}

<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(excited, gesturing with her hands)}
<D>__{what has the universe got to do with it? you're here in brooklyn! brooklyn is not expanding!}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(heartily, looking down at alvy)}
<D>__{it won't be expanding for billions of years yet, alvy. and we've gotta try to enjoy ourselves while we're here. uh?}
