<A>__{zack sleeps at the end of one bed, fully dressed. bitsey, lost in agitated thought, neatly packs a suit into her perfectly arranged suitcase. she stops, thinks. she goes to her purse and takes out the vhs cassette, a pen and a note pad. hesitating a beat, she puts the tape in the vcr. she turns on the tv and waits for an image.}
