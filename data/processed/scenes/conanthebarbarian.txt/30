<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{conan, unconscious, is dragged down the street by the two city guards.}
<D>__{city guard #1}
<P>__{(struggling)}
<D>__{by the gods, he's as heavy as a horse. city guard #2 even a dead horse smells better than this.}
<L>__{exterior prison yard night}
<A>__{the city guards drag conan into a broad prison yard. many of the inmates are shackled together, hacking with picks at the rock walls on their work detail. those in no condition to break rock are left in their own filth to rot. some are even dead already, the rats gnawing at the remains.}
<L>__{interior prison guardhouse night}
<A>__{the two city guards drag conan into the guardhouse, where a lieutenant sits eating his dinner. the lieutenant doesn't even bother to look up from his meal.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{what's the charge? city guard #2 public drunkenness. another damn hill ape who can't handle his liquor.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{is that so, boy? how do you plead?}
<A>__{conan yawns in response. one of the city guards slaps conan, hard, across the face. conan slowly opens his eyes.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{where's the captain of the guard?}
<A>__{screams of pain come from down the hall, past a locked door.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{in the cells, interrogating a prisoner. and you'll get the same if you don't answer. you're accused of public drunkenness. how do you plead?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{in truth, i've been guilty of much. jewels stolen from the crowns of kings, men's heads split in battle for the price of a night's drink. but through that i've searched and waited and hunted my prey.}
<A>__{suddenly conan shifts upright, looking more sober than he did a moment ago.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{but drink? haven't had a drop all night.}
<A>__{the guards holding conan up by his arms, suddenly find those arms wrapped around their heads. twist, twist. snap. snap. he breaks both their necks in an instant. the lieutenant is horrified. he goes for his sword. conan bats it out of his hand, slamming his head against the back wall.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{the key to the cells.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{i don't have it. there's a guard inside the door. only he can open it.}
<A>__{conan picks up the lieutenant's sword.}
<C>__{lieutenant }
<D>__{you can't kill me! he'll only open the door for me!}
<A>__{a flash of steel as conan delivers a blow.}
