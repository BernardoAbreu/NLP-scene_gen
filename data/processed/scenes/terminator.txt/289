<A>__{reese and terminator race along opposite sides of a row of cars, approaching the exit. the cruiser pulls ahead and closes diagonally as they clear the last car. reese sees the other's shotgun leveled. he ducks, steering blind, keeps it floored. the windshield and side window explodes inward. the buick slams into the black and white, spinning it into a parked truck. tires scream as the two cars slew around heading for the exit. several angles, as the police react. the chopper banks tight and dives across the tops of the parked cars. cruisers race to converge.}
