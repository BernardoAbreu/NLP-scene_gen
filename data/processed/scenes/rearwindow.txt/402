<A>__{we see lisa start to excuse her presence in the same manner she used with thorwald previously, as if to say she came into the apartment by mistake. thorwald, listening, comes quickly forward to contradict her, vigorously. he holds out the jewelry in his hand, and then picks up and shows the empty handbag. the policeman, impressed, looks back to lisa for an explanation. she has none. over this we hear stella frantically asking:}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{what's she trying to do? why doesn't she turn him in?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{smart girl.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{smart? she'll be arrested!}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{that'll get her out of there, won't it?}
<A>__{the first policeman indicates that lisa is to come along with him. he pauses momentarily to tell the second policeman to take a statement from thorwald about the attempted burglary. the second policeman reaches for the jewelry in thorwald's hand, and takes it for examination. in the brief pause while the two policemen speak to each other, lisa starts to wave her left hand behind her back.}
