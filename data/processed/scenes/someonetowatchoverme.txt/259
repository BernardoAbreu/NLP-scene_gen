<D>__{let's do it.}
<A>__{they take to the floor, she moving into his arms. she puts her head on his shoulder, then draws back to look at him, studying his face with the hunger of a woman who knows it might be for the last time.}

<D>__{they guys treatin' you all right?}

<A>__{he holds her tight his eyes emotional as they roam the room but his expression changes as he spots something at a far end of the room. near the rear doors. it's a plainclothesmen, headed purposefully toward koontz, conferring with him both men looking to mike, a sense of bewilderment in their eyes. angle on mike: stopping as koontz heads quickly toward.}
<C>__{koontz}
<D>__{brook's patching a call through to you. he thought he'd find you here. it sounds urgent.}
<A>__{mike: baffled.}
<C>__{koontz}
