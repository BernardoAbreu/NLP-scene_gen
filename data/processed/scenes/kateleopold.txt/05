<L>__{exterior estate day}
<A>__{the riding outfit is adorned by leopold, duke of albany, a dashing, virile man in his 30's. galloping with great abandon, he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. he sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path. in the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the estate. rugs are beaten out of open windows.}
<L>__{interior hallway evening}
<A>__{large hallway clock 6:15. a pair of boots track a freshly scrubbed floor as leopold heads carelessly up the stairway. three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling the staff to clean up the mess.}
<B>__{series of close ups}
<A>__{gaudily framed portraits of somber relations. a bird sits listless in a gilded cage. hot water is poured into a bath. carriages begin to arrive. orchestra leader signals the musicians to play. guests fill the ballroom in formal attire.}
