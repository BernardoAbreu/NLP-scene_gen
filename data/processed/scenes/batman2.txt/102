<A>__{a curious bruce ushers gordon into the library, gestures toward the liquor cabinet. the commissioner nods his head no. he's fidgety, ill at ease he obviously doesn't want to be here.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{sorry to bother you. bruce i will get right down to it. you knew shaw and barrett }
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i saw them occasionally. we all sat on the board of the fluegelheim...}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{did you have any...dealings with them, or }
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{no. i never liked the way they did business.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{the thing is, bruce, you're all lumped together in the public mind the five families of gotham, that sort of thing and, uh...}
<P>__{(taking a card from his pocket)}
<D>__{harrison provost got this in the mail.}
<A>__{bruce examines the card, "those who feed," etc. he stares at gordon in mock concern, playing it close to the vest...}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{then batman is behind all this.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{batman or a damned good imitation.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{well. he's changed tactics, hasn't he.}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(shrugging; at a loss)}
<D>__{shaw, with his high rises barrett, a druglord, major polluter they weren't exactly model citizens. who knows, it could be some crazy social conscience kind of thing.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{you mean he's going after...the root of the problem.}
<A>__{gordon shakes his head and gets up to go. bruce hands him the card.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{let me know if you get one of these. we'll put all our resources at your disposal.}
<A>__{bruce nods thoughtfully as alfred appears to see the commissioner out. a moment later, the butler reappears.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{changed my mind, alfred. i will be dropping in on the fluegelheim after all.}
