<L>__{exterior western woods (time cut) night}
<A>__{horses are tied. ichabod is seated against a tree. a campfire burns. young masbath lies on a blanket, rifle cross his chest, staring to treetops. leaves and branches shift in the wind. bats fly wildly.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{what does it mean... climb down to the horseman's soulless place?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{"let loose his silent shrieking." who knows, till we work at it? i admit not being anxious to find out.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{"he who holds the horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." whatever the horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.}
<A>__{a snapping branch. ichabod raises his pistol.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<P>__{(to young masbath)}
<D>__{do not move.}
<A>__{ichabod rises. he creeps forward, pistol and lantern forward. foliage is thick. crunching leaves are heard. ichabod crouches, puts down the lantern and picks up a branch. he tosses the branch to the foliage... some animal darts away, a running blur. ichabod rises, following with his pistol. another angle, moving p.o.v.: low to the ground, moving swiftly at ichabod... ichabod spins, blindsided. young masbath fires his rifle crack!! the animal is knocked down mid leap, yelping... the beast lands, a mass of grey fur. ichabod comes to stare down. young masbath arrives. they both look to the beast, horrified. the creature lies helplessly spastic; a two headed wolf, with one head blown open to brain and gore. its living head lifts, mewing sadly, eyes pleading. ichabod step up with pistol. fires. mewing stops.}

<D>__{what god forsaken hell is this?}
<A>__{ichabod swallows back sickness, looking away. something catches his eye.}

<D>__{christ...}
<A>__{through the forest: the sky's lit up. distant fire.}
