<L>__{interior indians' locker room day}
<A>__{the indians are undressing after practice.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{why the hell are we havin' practice during the all star break?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i heard the big lady upstairs ordered it.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{it's hotter than shit in here. what happened to the air conditioning?}
<L>__{interior training room day}
<A>__{we go to brown, naked and dragging from the heat. he approaches the whirlpool and turns on the water.}
<C>__{brown}
<P>__{(to dorn)}
<D>__{oh man, this old body can use a soak.}
<C>__{dorn}
<D>__{forget it. it's not workin' again.}
<A>__{brown flips on a switch. the whirlpool makes some grinding noises and then quits altogether.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{damn it, i thought they were gonna replace this thing.}
<A>__{harris shouts over from the showers where he's just turned on the water.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{hey, there's no hot water in here.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{she's at it again. i've had it with this nickel and dime stuff.}
<P>__{(storming out of the training room)}
<D>__{i'm gonna get the bitch on the phone.}
<A>__{brown is stopped short by the sight of rachel phelps standing in the middle of the locker room as various unclad players dive for cover.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you wanted to see the bitch?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{yeh.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{don't you think you oughta cover yourself with a towel first, mr. brown?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{there aren't any towels, and i'm too old to be diving under benches.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{well, i can take it if you can.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{what happened to the new whirlpool we were supposed to get?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{revenue problems have forced us to cut back on equipment. we'll simply have to fix the old one.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{you fixed it six times already. and now there's no hot water in the showers.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{the pipes in this building are old and rusted. we're replacing them, but it's a long, expensive process.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{how am i supposed to keep my players healthy with cold water and no therapy equipment?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{your players will just have to get a little tougher. what are they, a bunch of pansies?}
<A>__{immediately, 30 arms shoot up behind her in the italian "up yours" gesture. she turns around, but by then the players have quickly returned to normal positions.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{over 162 games even tough guys get sprains, sore arms, muscle pulls...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it's only temporary. besides, these guys weren't playing that good when the equipment was workin'. if i could get anybody to come and watch this team, none of this would be necessary. you oughta be grateful i can still pay your salaries.}
<A>__{with that, rachel turns and walks out. brown and the others can only watch her go.}
