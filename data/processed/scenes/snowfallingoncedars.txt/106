<L>__{interior jury room night}
<A>__{eleven citizens around a walnut table. eleven. glaring at the twelfth.}
<C>__{alexander van ness}
<D>__{well. i guess it comes down to a feeling, don't it? if i feel uncertain, i feel a doubt . isn't that it?}
<A>__{and the boat builder smiles amicably, rubs his gray beard. no other smiles. anywhere.}
<C>__{harold jensen}
<D>__{alex, nobody ain't ever sure about nothin'. it's un reasonable to be so stubborn that you think you're smarter than eleven folks who all agree !}
<C>__{edith twardzik}
<D>__{the man sat there and admitted he lied , mr. van ness. now why isn't that enough for you?}
<C>__{alexander van ness}
<D>__{we're not tryin' him for lying. lots of us told lies, one time or another. prob'ly none of us murdered anybody.}
<C>__{harold jensen}
<D>__{but what drives a man to lie? means he's hiding somethin'.}
<C>__{alexander van ness}
<D>__{not necessarily that he killed carl. i'm not sayin' you're wrong, just that i have my doubts.}
<C>__{burke latham}
<D>__{look, if you changed chairs right now, cos you doubted that maybe a chunk of the moon was gonna fall through the roof, that wouldn't be a reasonable doubt.}
<A>__{folks turn to burke. what the hell are you talking about?}
<C>__{alexander van ness }
<D>__{okay, you win that one. now can we all go to bed? harlan mcqueen the mooring line. doesn't that tell you something?}
<C>__{alexander van ness}
<D>__{i think it does. miyamoto was on carl's boat, or vice versa. not much doubt about th... marlan mcqueen and carl's blood on the gaff?}
<C>__{alexander van ness}
<D>__{there's a chance it came from his hand.}
<C>__{burke latham}
<D>__{there's a chance of everything. but you add a chance from here and a chance from there, the world ain't made a coincidences only.}
<A>__{everyone agrees. almost everyone.}
<C>__{edith twardzik}
<D>__{look, if he gave carl a battery like he said, he'd only a had one left. not two.}
<C>__{alexander van ness}
<D>__{he explained that. he replaced it. harlan mcqueen only he threw that part in when he got cornered. but first time around, he never mentioned it.}
<C>__{roger porter}
<D>__{alex, stop arguin' just to argue. you can see what really happened, same as us. isn't that what we're supposed to do is tell the actual truth? my god, carl died, here.}
<C>__{alexander van ness}
<D>__{so i don't care carl died, unless i'm ready to reach for the hangman's rope? you oughta stop tryin' to bully me into hurrying.}
<A>__{little anger in that. it brings a silence.}
<C>__{burke latham}
<D>__{been six hours. you sayin' there's a way to go slower?}
