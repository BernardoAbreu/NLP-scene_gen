<A>__{drab, government issue. ross, the bored desk clerk is thumbing his way through road & track. just as he stops to stare at a motor oil ad in which a buxom blonde is straddling the hood of a car, the huge door opens and erin enters.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{whew! goddamn, that's a heavy door.}
<A>__{ross looks up. it's like the girl from the ad walked right off the page. he jumps up, to help her with the door.}

<D>__{i wish i knew. it's for my boss. he's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places. the easiest thing would probably be if i just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself. would that be okay?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{heck, yeah. come on back. just gonna need you to sign in here }
<A>__{he hands her a pen. he reads over her shoulder as she signs her name erin pattee brockovich.}

<A>__{she smiles and winks at him, then goes around the counter with him and looks at the stacks and stacks of files.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{well. here goes nothing.}
<A>__{she heads down an aisle, reading the spines of the files. they're all town names barstow, victorville, oro grande, helendale in no particular order. finally, erin spots one that says hinkley. she pulls it down.}
<B>__{in the file}
<A>__{are pages and pages of xeroxed memoranda, letters, charts, graphs, handwritten notes. all shoved in willy nilly.}
