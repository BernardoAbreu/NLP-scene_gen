<L>__{exterior rudy's night}
<A>__{it's new year's eve at rudy's, a hole in the wall dive. people stream into the bar to celebrate. outside, carl kendall (30s) and his soon to be ex girlfriend kath are having a quiet intense discussion.}
<C>__{kath}
<D>__{you don't do anything more. you used to be fun. now you hardly ever even leave your apartment.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i'm here, aren't i?}
<C>__{kath}
<D>__{that's because it's new year's eve. you have to be here. besides, it's not only social stuff. you used to have dreams. you wanted to go to business school, you wanted to work for the world bank.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{so i discovered b school's not for me. people grow.}
<C>__{kath}
<D>__{growing is "x is not for me so i will do y." you went x is not for me and so i guess i will sit on the couch for the rest of my life.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(acquiescing)}
<D>__{well, look, this sucks, but i understand where you're coming from.}
<C>__{kath}
<D>__{this is the problem. you don't even care that i'm breaking up with you.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{of course i care. but i also understand.}
<C>__{kath}
<D>__{you shouldn't just understand. you should be mad. or upset. or sad. or something.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{we're at different places in our lives. i get it.}
<C>__{kath}
<D>__{your girlfriend of two years breaks up with you right before new year's eve and all you can say is "i get it?" it is completely within your right to call me a bitch.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{that would be inappropriate.}
<C>__{kath}
<P>__{(tearing up)}
<D>__{i can't believe i've been dating someone so emotionless.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{c'mere. it'll be ok.}
