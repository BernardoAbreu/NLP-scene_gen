<A>__{in slow mo, finnegan and the others creep down a darkened, pipe lined passageway. guns out front. sight beams sweeping the path ahead. eyes wide open. sweat sliding down their faces. breath coming in short nervous bursts. hearts pounding out of chests. the ominous musical score adds to the tension. then the emergency lighting kicks on. a creepy looking reddish blue glow is cast throughout the ship. finnegan continues on. followed by the others. all sweating hard. eyes nervously shifting. fear thick in the air. looking down through a metal gate, we see finnegan, trillian and the others passing below. then suddenly, in the dark foreground something wet wriggles across the gate. they come to a door. finnegan tries the handle. no go. finnegan turns to canton, and mimes for keys. canton shakes his head. he has none.}

<A>__{trillian moves up to finnegan. she reaches into her hair, and pulls out her trusty lockpick. as he watches, somewhat mystified, she inserts the pin, tickles the lock a few times, and depresses the handle. click! the door opens. finnegan looks at her curiously, but with respect.}
