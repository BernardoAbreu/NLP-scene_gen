<L>__{interior hearse day}
<A>__{the hearse is parked outside the row of terraced houses. a youthful undertaker is minding it. he turns and looks through the back window as a young girl walks up the street. doreen carter is sixteen and, like most girls of her age, tries to look older. she wears all the right gear but it's cheap and doesn't fit properly. her long hair is lank. there's something sad and embarrassing about her appearance. the young undertaker watches as she enters frank's house.}
