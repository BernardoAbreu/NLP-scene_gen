<A>__{harlan is at the top. chris is a bit lower. the spiders are still coming. chris shoots at them. his gun runs dry. he flips it around and butt strokes an approaching arac. a spider fires a web at harlan. nails the poor guy. and drags him off the antenna. harlan falls off the antenna, back toward the spiders. chris reaches out and grabs him. holding harlan's hand.}

<D>__{no!}
<A>__{harlan jerks away from chris's hand. he cannonballs down into the horde of spiders. splattering several of the beasts along with himself. chris throws the useless shotgun at an approaching arac and climbs even higher. he pulls out his machete and begins hacking at the guide wires that hold the antenna upright. the spiders close in. chris slices one wire. the antenna quivers. chris slices another wire. the antenna shakes.}
