<C>__{winter}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{yeah, but he left something for you.}
<A>__{he wipes his greasy fingers on a napkin, then finds an envelope on the desk and hands it to jetson. jetson tears open the sealed envelope. the message inside is written in the alien language.}
<C>__{winter}
<P>__{(continuing)}

<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(to jetson)}
