<L>__{exterior warehouse district day}
<A>__{the ten black market european sports cars are loaded on two transport trucks. mafiya bodyguards keep watch. the ivans (in teamster garb) inspect the cars while xander supervises. anders hovers around him.}
<C>__{anders}
<D>__{so what you think? beautiful!}
<A>__{sitting in an office watching are yorgi, kirill and petra. petra has a laptop.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{has it arrived yet?}
<A>__{petra checks her computer. on screen she's monitoring their}
<B>__{bank account.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{nothing. he had two days.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{perhaps he is not all he says he is.}
<A>__{outside the ivans nod approval and xander heads to the office. yorgi looks to kirill, who puts his hand on his pistol. xander opens the door.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{very nice. i'm impressed.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{i'm somewhat less so. we seem to have a bit of a problem...}
<A>__{just then petra's computer beeps and the money floods into their account. xander holds up a cell phone and smiles.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i had to inspect the merchandise first.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{he nods for kirill to stand down. outside the two transport trucks are driven off by the ivans. as they pull out they reveal another car under a cover.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{this is a gift. from me to you.}
<A>__{anders pulls off the cover, revealing a cherry '72 pontiac}
<B>__{gto.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{it's a little nothing, you take it.}
<A>__{xander checks out his new ride. yorgi gets in the passenger seat.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{come on, get in.}
<A>__{xander sits behind the wheel and starts it up. the big engine}
<B>__{roars.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you're alright, yorgi.}
<A>__{next door to the warehouse sits an abandoned building. up on the sloped roof, slovo spies down on the transaction. he's got a camera with a big zoom lens.}
<C>__{slovo}
<D>__{smile, bychara.}
<A>__{slovo snaps a few pictures but his view is obscured. to get a better vantage, he jumps down onto a lower part of the roof. crunch! his foot breaks through the shabby roof tile. down below, kirill hears the noise.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{yorgi!}
<A>__{they all look to the abandoned building. through the second floor window they can see slovo's leg poking through the ceiling. xander is taken aback.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{what in the hell...?}
<A>__{yorgi turns to xander, goes for his pistol. thinking fast, xander does the same. they draw simultaneously and hold the guns to each other's heads as they sit in the car. petra, kirill and anders draw as well, all of them covering xander.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{what's going on, my friend?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you tell me! you got a sniper up there or what?}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{he's not with us, xander. he must be with you.}
<C>__{xander}
<P>__{(he cocks the hammer)}
<D>__{bullshit! you get your boy off that roof or i swear to god i'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.}
<A>__{yorgi stares, finally believes him. he lowers his gun.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{get him! find out who he is!}
<A>__{by now slovo is down the fire escape. he hits the ground and goes running down the street. the anarchy 99 crew heads for their cars. xander spins the cylinder on his revolver.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i've got him. buckle up.}
<A>__{the gto peels out.}
