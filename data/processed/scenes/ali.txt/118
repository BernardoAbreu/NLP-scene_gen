<L>__{interior n.o.i. bakery, chicago white silk scarf day (flashback)}
<A>__{in ali's hands. he leans across a white showcase of bakery goods. it's cold outside; warm inside. it smells of bread and coffee. belinda boyd reacts.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{watch now...}
<A>__{he makes a fist, balls the scarf up, and puts it in the hollow of his fist.}
<C>__{ali }
<P>__{(offering)}
<D>__{blow on it...}
<A>__{she blows on it. she's not quite eighteen, six feet tall; there's a supremely confident expressiveness about her. her gestures are large. he opens his hand. the scarf is gone. she instinctively looks over at his other hand. nothing's there. his eyes go wide in mock fright at the mysterious.}
<C>__{ali }
<D>__{this spooky! don't get scared...}
<A>__{she laughs. how'd he do it? he makes a fist again, puts his thumb in the hollow. and slowly pulls the scarf out...}
<C>__{belinda}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{see, you don't need to fight no more...}
<A>__{he gives it to belinda. she ties it around her neck. ali looks at her. on a cold and dark afternoon, the windows are steamed and the bakery seems a fine refuge.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{so what's fresh, girl?}
<C>__{belinda}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{everything fresh!}
<C>__{ali}
