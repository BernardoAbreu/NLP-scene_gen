<A>__{j.d. laconically leans against his motorcycle with his legs suavely crossed. he looks up to veronica's bedroom window and hears another whimper emerge. he puts a cigarette in his mouth and lights it with a smile. veronica's bedroom veronica curls into a fetal position on her bed and closes her eyes.....tighter and tighter as j.d.'s voice.}
<C>__{j.d. }
<D>__{"you can't ever find a place nice and peaceful because there isn't any."}
<A>__{veronica flops around to see j.d. kneeling over her on her bed reading heather duke's copy of the catcher in the rye.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{nice. it's got that catcher in the ryey i hate the world and the world hates me so let's commit suicide ambience. give it a try, underline something.}
<A>__{j.d. giddily underlines words then slides into a prone position, tossing the book to an enraged veronica.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{get off my bed, you sick psycho! you think you're a rebel! you're not a rebel! you're a sick psycho! do you think you're a rebel? do you think you're a rebel? i wanna know!}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{"you say tomayto, i say tomahto. let's call the whole thing off...hold it!}
<A>__{veronica freezes and j.d. reaches up to her hand where she holds the catcher in the rye. her index finger is curled into the book. sitting up, j.d. carefully opens the book at that place and peers in.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{look at that. eskimo. one word. i love it. i usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. eskimo. so mysterious...}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{wait a....you're not listening! i'm not on your side....}
<A>__{j.d. obliviously underlines the word then pulls the flailing veronica up like an enthusiastic camp counselor.}
