<A>__{mackelway sits at the window, looking over the backyard. nothing special out here: some trees, a swing, a storm cellar door. but he's staring at it, intently. we're not sure why. behind him, jan re enters, purse over her shoulder, umbrella in hand. she grabs his cup of coffee and saucer from the coffee table.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{i'm sorry i don't have more time, agent mackelway. it's my pta day.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{it's fine. i should've called.}
<A>__{she smiles tightly: "i have to go now" and heads for the kitchen. once she's there, mackelway turns to the back door and unlocks it, eyeing that storm cellar outside... she leaves the cup in the sink. he enters the kitchen.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{i hope i was of some help.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{you were. thanks.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{a friend of mine said i will feel like this one month for every year we were together. sort of a grieving rule of thumb. have you ever heard that?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{no. sorry.}
<A>__{she half smiles. he turns to the door. turns back.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{oh. there was one other thing: did he keep any kind of chemicals around the house? acids, that sort of thing?}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{no. why?}
<A>__{he shrugs, dismissing it:}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{it's nothing. trace elements we found on his trunk. any interest in chemistry? maybe as a hobby?}
<A>__{jan pauses for a moment, as if recovering a faint memory... then she shakes it off. he lets it go.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{anyway, thank you. and thanks for the coffee. next time i will call first, i promise.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{no trouble at all.}
