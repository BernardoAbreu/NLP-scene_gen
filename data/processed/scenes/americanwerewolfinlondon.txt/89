<A>__{dr. hirsch waits on the phone, finally hanging up.}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{he's not there.}
<A>__{alex grows worried.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{he's not?}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{alex, has david persisted in his werewolf fantasies?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{has his friend appeared to him again?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{david says jack comes to warn him.}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{warn him?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{dr. hirsch, what's wrong? is this more serious than i know?}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{i tried to investigate the attack. there are no records. the case was closed and now they've `misplaced' the file. david's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before i did. the goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. so i went to the pub in east proctor where i was convinced of two things.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{they were lying. there were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. the whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{and what else?}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{i think the village of east proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. i'm convinced that, like david, they believe in this werewolf.}
<A>__{alex is flabbergasted.}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{you've absolutely no idea where david might be?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{no. he knows no one in london, besides me. i shouldn't have left him alone.}
<A>__{suddenly.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{surely you're not suggesting....}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{david has suffered a severe trauma. i myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in east proctor. if all the villagers believe that jack goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't david? and then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{dr. hirsch?}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{oh, i don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. but in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what shall we do?}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.}
