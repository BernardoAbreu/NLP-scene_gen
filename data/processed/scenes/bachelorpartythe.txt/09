<A>__{an express train hurtles southward. we see it flashing by through the concrete pillars of the subway.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{irt express hurtling southward}
<A>__{charlie and another young man, named kenneth, are seated in a crowded subway car. people are standing tightly in the aisles. kenneth is an amiable young man of thirty odd. he has his jacket off and his tie loosened as a concession to the august heat. charlie is neatly and coolly dressed. he has two notebooks and a battered text in his lap. he is reading the texterior two young white collar workers on their way to work. they ride along silently for a moment. kenneth is rather stealthily concerned with a full busted young woman who is standing directly in front of him, holding on to a strap. it is summertime, and the girls all wear light summer frocks. there is a feeling of wistful sensuality to the scene.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{you going to arnold's bachelor party?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't think so, kennie.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i got two classes tonight.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah, i was going to go, but i think i better not, because my kid, the young one, the girl, she's been acting up again lately. she's got some kind of allergy, the doctors don't know what.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{these bachelor parties get kind of wild sometimes. eddie watkins is making all the arrangements. he's probably got us lined up with a bunch of chorus girls.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah, do you think so?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you know eddie.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah, boy, he really lives it up, don't he? did you see that blonde who picked him up for lunch last week? boy, sometimes i wish i was a bachelor. well, you know what i mean. i never seem to get out of the house any more, you know what i mean? about once a week, i go to the movies. we never even see the whole picture. my wife starts worrying about the kids. my youngest kid, the girl, she's got some kind of rash. we don't know what it is. i never seem to see anybody any more. do you know how long it is since i've seen willie duff? i haven't seen willie in about six months. my wife can't stand his wife. you ever seen her, willie's wife?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, i didn't know willie too well.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{boy, wait'll you have kids, boy. you'll never get out of the house.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{helen's pregnant now.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{no kidding.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{oh, that's wonderful, charlie, that's wonderful!}
<A>__{the two young husbands look down again at their hands and ride along silently. kenneth sneaks a quick look up at the girl standing in front of him, and then lets his attention drift down the length of the car.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{hey, there's a guy down there, trying to pick up a girl down there.}
<A>__{he is referring to a young fellow who elbowed his way down through the crowded aisle but who stopped abruptly when he noticed an attractive girl, seated about three seats down from kenneth. the girl is reading a newspaper. the young fellow stares at her. the girl, aware of this sudden attention, looks briefly up from her newspaper. the young fellow smiles pleasantly. the girl, with a show of annoyance, looks back to her newspaper.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{were you with us about eight years ago when i picked up that chick in front of the bus stop in paterson, new jersey?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{when was this?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah, you were there. you were with that girl from brooklyn. we just came from palisades amusement park, and we were driving frankie klein's girl home, and the car broke down right in the middle of route one.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(beginning to laugh)}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{and frankie opened up the hood and the water cap blew right up in the air.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and the cop came over ...}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{that's right, the cop. he thought frankie shot off a gun....}
<A>__{they are both laughing audibly now at the memory.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{he was going to pull us all in. oh, man!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{frankie, he was funny.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{oh, that was a lot of fun, those days.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah, they were.}
<A>__{the little spasm of laughter is over. a sort of ruefulness settles down on the two young husbands. kenneth looks lazily down the aisle to see how the young fellow is making out with the girl. he seems to be making out all right. they are looking steadily at each other now. kenneth turns back to charlie.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{hey, this guy's making out all right. she's giving him the eye now.}
<A>__{charlie leans forward to see this progress.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(looking out the}
<D>__{window at the passing}
<P>__{local station)}
<D>__{where are we now, prince street? i bet you he picks her up before we hit chambers street.}
<A>__{somehow this has a sobering effect on the two young husbands. again they sit silently as the train buckets along.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{boy, i'm bushed today. i was up till two o'clock last night on this thing here. i'm getting to be a nervous wreck. i snarled at helen this morning. i think this whole night school business is getting me down.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{i don't see how you do it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{neither do i. i thought i was through with it. the plan was for me to quit work and go to college full time and cram through in a year or so. but now we got this kid coming, and helen's going to have to quit her job, and that sets me back where i started from. another five years of this, summers included.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{i couldn't do it, man, i will tell you that. i wish i could, but i couldn't.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{oh, what am i griping about? this is the life i picked out for myself. but it's a grind, boy, i tell you.}
<A>__{they sit silently again. the train hurtles along and then suddenly slows as it approaches a stop. there is a rustle of movement among the passengers in the subway car. a few people start edging toward the doors. the girl reading the newspaper now folds her newspaper and stands almost directly in the young fellow's face. they regard each other.}
<C>__{young fellow}
<P>__{(to the girl)}
<D>__{excuse me, can you tell me how to get to the nassau street exit?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{well ... well, at the top of the stairs, you'll see all the signs.}
<C>__{young fellow}
<D>__{are you getting off here?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{young fellow}
<D>__{well, i will follow you then. that'll be easier, if you don't mind.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{no, not at all.}
<A>__{they start to crowd down the aisle. the train is chugging into the chambers street station, and we can see the yellowed lights of the platform and the quick blur of faces. the two young husbands, who had been following the byplay between the girl and the young fellow, now watch them slowly exit. there is an expression of poignant wistfulness on both their faces.}
