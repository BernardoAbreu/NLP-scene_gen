<L>__{exterior mountain day}
<A>__{we see a craggy, gnarly mountain. the front side is a rock strewn, near vertical drop. then we see xander come scaling up from the back side. he's got gear strapped to his back and it looks like it's been a helluva climb. xander sits at the very peak and catches his breath. it's beautiful up here. he pulls a collapsible snowboard off his back, hits a switch and the thing switchblades out to full size. he clamps it on his feet. xander moves to the edge and peers down. at the bottom of the mountain he can see the castle, an imposing medieval fortress in the snow. he leans over the edge and starts down the mountain. he doesn't get far before he notices something else. he slides to a stop on the near vertical face, clinging to rocks for balance. on the mountain below him, between him and the castle, is a guard outpost. right now he's in full view and he's been spotted. he sees guards scrambling out, hopping on snowmobiles. from up here they look like ants.}
