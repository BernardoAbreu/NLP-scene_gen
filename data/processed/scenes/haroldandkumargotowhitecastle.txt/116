<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{harold and kumar are now sitting on top of the cheetah, smoking joints. kumar has a belt around the cheetah's neck like reigns on a horse.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{has it come to this? are we really gonna ride this cheetah?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{hey, cheetahs are the fastest animals on the planet. it's as good as a car.}
<A>__{kumar takes one last drag of a joint and flicks it away.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{this is either a really smart move, or by far the stupidest thing we've ever done.}
<A>__{harold puts his arms around kumar to hold on. kumar puts the bag of weed under his shirt...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{well, we'll soon find out.}
<P>__{(like to a snow dog)}
<D>__{mush! mush!}
<A>__{suddenly, the cheetah darts out like lightening with harold and kumar on it's back. even though it makes absolutely no sense, we see the cheetah zooming past streets and forests.}
<B>__{harold and kumar are bouncing up and down as it races across a major highway...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{dude, am i just really high or is this is actually working?!}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{both!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{this is great! we'll be at white castle in no...}
<A>__{smack! a branch hits harold in the face, knocking him off the cheetah. harold lands on the ground his head bleeding. his eyes slowly close as he goes unconscious...}
