<L>__{exterior alley #5 night}
<A>__{as sean runs into view, glancing around, spotting rennie, crouched against a crumbled brick wall. no tears...only hate. sean sits down next to her. after several moments...}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{i was at school when they told me. 'rennie, we have some very bad news... your parents have been killed in an auto accident.'}
<A>__{sean gently takes her hand, sharing her internal agony.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{it seems like everybody i care about ends up...}
<A>__{she can't finish. push in as sean kisses her on the forehead, then makes her look into his eyes.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{not this time.}
<A>__{he caresses her face; it develops into a tender kiss. finally she holds him back, letting it out. at the same time:}
<B>__{stalking point of view}
<A>__{somebody is creeping at a low angle towards them.}
<B>__{sean and rennie}
<A>__{are lost in their shared quiet moment...until the growling sound becomes audible. they look up, seeing:}
<B>__{toby}
<A>__{cautiously approaching them. rennie stands, absolutely relieved.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{toby...}
<A>__{she starts to move towards him and her dog snarls viciously, crouching back in fear.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{what's wrong, boy?}
<A>__{another protective growl, then: crash! as jason stampedes through a stack of crates and garbage cans behind them. sean, rennie and toby abruptly flee down the alley, jason in mad pursuit.}
