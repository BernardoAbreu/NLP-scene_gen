<A>__{a bus has arrived. the attendant returns to his post. jamie hangs up the phone, filled with trepidation as passengers file inside. a strung out rocker. a pair of stern faced nuns. a pretty teenager greeted in the loving arms of her boyfriend. just as she is about to step out of the phone booth, a tall man, back turned, wearing a hat and black trench coat, moves to stand outside the booth! jamie freezes. securing her baby in the knapsack, jamie throws open the door. suddenly the tall man steps in her path!}
