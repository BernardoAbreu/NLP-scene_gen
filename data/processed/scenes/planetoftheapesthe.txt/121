<A>__{he faints.}
<T>__{fade out: fade in:}
<L>__{interior a surgery angling down on two operating tables night}
<A>__{the surgery is dimly lit. (if possible we should be unaware of the source of illumination.) taylor lies strapped to the nearer table. he appears to be unconscious. the young female captive, nova, is strapped to the table beside him. she is conscious. taylor is receiving a direct blood transfusion from her. hovering over taylor are a nurse and a surgeon named galen. both are chimpanzees. galen wears a bloody surgical apron, the nurse a white smock. galen is removing a filthy bandage from taylor's neck. a door behind them opens and dr. zira, an animal psychologist, enters. she, too, is a chimpanzee and wears a smock like the nurse's.}

<D>__{which one was wearing the strange clothes?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{him.}
<A>__{zira looks down at taylor.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{will he live?}
<C>__{galen}
<P>__{(irritably)}
<D>__{i don't know. this beast lost a lot of blood.}
<A>__{galen paws through a tray of surgical instruments. the equipment is obsolescent and the room untidy like that of a callous small town veterinarian.}
<C>__{galen}
<P>__{(to nurse )}
<D>__{there's no probe here. find one!}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{she exits. zira runs a forefinger across a dusty table.her voice is soft and well modulated.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{this place is dirty, doctor.}
<C>__{galen}
<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{these animals are dirty, doctor. they stink, and they carry communicable diseases. why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?}
