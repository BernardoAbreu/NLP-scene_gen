<P>__{(to the lieutenant)}
<D>__{my mother has a sense for such things. she said there would be no fog.}

<C>__{mordred}
<D>__{...mother?}
<A>__{morgana, withered, old, lies dead in the bed, wisps of smoke rising from within her ruptured body.}
<L>__{exterior moors by the sea fog dawn}
<A>__{arthur, with kay and perceval, canters through the white fog. they are flanked by a phalanx of knights in silver armor.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{kay, you will lead the attack. perceval, you will stay with me.}
<A>__{kay draws his sword in salute, elated.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{be cautious, my brother.}
<A>__{he spurs forward, while arthur reins to a halt, watching him disappear. perceval and a few knights stay behind and surround the king.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{in this battle there is one thing i must do, that no one else can. find mordred and kill him.}
<A>__{ahead, the horrible din of joined battle. in the swirling fog, clash of arms follows clash of arms. there is confusion, for each knight is unable to see if he is fighting friend or foe until they are upon each other. the battle becomes a series of vicious duels, a knight in silver armor against a knight in black burnished armor, just glimpsed in the fog that is alive with the clang of sword on shield, the pounding of hooves, the cries of the dying. squires drag away their wounded knights, their young faces pale at the sight of the carnage. kay is unhorsed but picks himself up and mounts a riderless horse, rejoining the combat although he is bleeding.}
