<L>__{interior lavish french furnished bedroom at point du lac}
<A>__{louis is delirious in a four poster bed, shrouded with mosquito netting. a female slave, yvette, bathes his face with a rag. she is crying. other slave women hover in the shadows. yvette puts out all candles save one by the bed, and withdraws, with the others. candlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin. louis tosses and turns, dreaming, murmuring incoherently. then he opens his eyes. lestat, exquisitely dressed in french clothing, stands by the bed smiling. in the light of the candle we see that he is not human; skin too white; eyes too bright. lestat looks amiable, even mischievous, but impossible and angel or monster. louis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{who the hell are you? what are you doing in my house?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{and a beautiful house it is too. yours is a good life, isn't it?}
<A>__{louis takes aim. lestat puts his hand over the barrel. louis fires. the bullet tears a hole in lestat's hand. lestat is unfazed. he takes the gun from louis' hand and throws it away. his hand begins to heal.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you're not afraid of anything, are you?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{why should i be?}
<A>__{louis reaches for his sword, hanging by the bed, and point it. lestat laughs indulgently. he draws closer.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{are you going to put that through me too? ruin my beautiful clothes?}
<A>__{he comes closer to louis, right up to his face, so the sword passes through his waistcoat.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{were all last night's promises for nothing?}
<A>__{he reaches out with his now healed hand and plucks out the sword.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what do you want from me?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i've come to answer your prayers. you want to die, don't you? life has no meaning anymore, does it?}
<A>__{lestat sits down on the bed, drawing up one knee. louis is becoming spellbound.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{the wine has no taste. the food sickens you. there seems no reason for any of it, does there? but what if i could give it back to you? pluck out the pain and give you another life? and it would be for all time? and sickness and death could never touch you again?}
<A>__{the vampire theme rises, with the sound of a heartbeat.}
