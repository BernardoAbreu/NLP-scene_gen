<A>__{a small room before a short sally port corridor designed to prevent violent inmates from making a run for it. there are doors at each end. the first one is barred like a jail cell door, and the second is a steel fire door. the attendants have a video monitor with which they can see the corridor on the other side of the doors. the two bored attendants barely notice the t 1000 guard as it approaches. looks briefly at a chart next to the door, seeing sarah connor is in #19.}
