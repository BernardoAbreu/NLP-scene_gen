<L>__{interior locker room night}
<A>__{the 27 year old butch coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: trunks, shoes and gloves. he lies on a table catching a few zzzzzz's before his big fight. almost as soon as we cut : to him, he wakes up with a start. shaken by the bizarre memory, he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove. his trainer klondike, an older fireplug, opens the door a little, sticking his head in the room. pandemonium seems to be breaking out behind klondike in the hallway.}

<D>__{it's time, butch.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{i'm ready.}
<A>__{klondike steps inside, closing the door on the wild mob outside. he goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. butch hops off the table and, without a word, klondike helps him on with the robe, which says on the back: "battling butch coolidge". the two men head for the door. klondike opens the door for butch. as butch steps into the hallway, the crowd goes apeshit. klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, empty locker room.}
