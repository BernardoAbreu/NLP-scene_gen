<L>__{interior jared's conference room continuous}
<A>__{there are four people sitting at the table. they stand. everyone says their somber hellos and shakes hands.}
<C>__{all present}
<D>__{slight hellos, etc.}
<A>__{they all sit down and at each place setting there is a pad of paper, a pencil, and an empty binder. sitting at the head of the table is jared cohen. he is a blond boyish looking 43 year old, although carries himself with intense confidence. he is the head of all fixed income securities, and oversees roughly 25,000 employees. next to him is his chief risk management officer, sarah robertson, the same woman from outside the building earlier who had the run in with eric. next to her is her right hand man ramesh shah, a sixty year old number cruncher and next to him is a firm lawyer. they are all dressed sharply for a new day. long silence.}
<B>__{seth coughs.}
<A>__{all present look down at him.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{so sam, what do you have for us?}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{well... it should be here in a minute. finding someone in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{well why don't we start by introducing everyone then.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{this is sarah robertson who you know, our chief risk management officer, ramesh shah from upstairs, and david horn one of the firm's in house counsel.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{nice to meet you all. this is will emerson my head of trading, and this is...}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{peter sullivan, and seth bregman. they work in our risk department.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{where is eric dale?}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{he was let go today.}
<A>__{jared cohen looks at sarah robertson as it would have been her call to let eric go, she nods yes.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{so who's left in your risk department?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{as of today that would be peter and our junior analyst seth...?}
<A>__{everyone looks down the table at peter and seth. their inexperience glares back.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{jared looks back at sarah, then the room goes silent again. finally a copy room staffer knocks on the door.}
<C>__{copy room guy}
<D>__{will emerson?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{here. please just give one to everyone, thanks.}
<A>__{the copy room guy hands out the packets to everyone in the room.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{so apparently eric had been working on this for some time but was unable to finish it, as he was leaving the building today he gave the program to peter here, and told him to see what he thought. peter figured a few things out that eric seemed to be missing and this is what came out.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{where is eric dale now?}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{he's been unreachable since he left the office.}
<A>__{jared cohen and the others open up the printout in front of them and start reviewing. sam, will, peter, and seth just sit in awkward silence staring at the other side of the table as they all read. this goes on for a full very long minute. finally:}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{peter this is your work?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{mainly mr. dale's...}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{but this draft is yours?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes. again, derived from mr. dale's original model. but yes.}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{and what is your background?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{background?}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{your cv.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i have been with the firm for two years working with eric that whole time... but i hold a doctorate in engineering, specialist in propulsion, from mit, with a bachelors from penn.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{what's a specialty in propulsion?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well... in laymen terms my thesis was a study in the way that friction ratios effect steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads.}
<A>__{long silence.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{so you are a rocket scientist?}
<A>__{the whole table looks over at peter with some awe.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{um... i was... yes.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{how did you end up here?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well it's all just numbers really, you're just changing what you're adding up... and if i may speak freely the money is considerably more attractive here.}
<A>__{jared looks down again at the numbers in front of him and his tone suddenly switches to serious, testy even.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{ramesh}
<D>__{it's 2:15.}
<A>__{sam and jared just look at each other in silence for a bit.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{what do you have in exposure right now, tonight?}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{i don't know... between 900 and 1.3... roughly.}
<C>__{ramesh}
<D>__{if mr. sullivan's numbers are correct...}
<A>__{ramesh looks down at the sheet in front of him to go through the numbers and takes a beat too long.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{1.215 trillion.}
<A>__{ramesh checks his number.}
<C>__{ramesh}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{fuck me... fuck me... and i'm guessing by the fact that you two haven't said anything that the math checks out?}
<A>__{jared looks over at sarah and ramesh. sarah then looks to ramesh. she looks back.}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{look we'd need a little more time to go over this, but mr. sullivan here seems to know what he's doing. and i don't have to tell you that this is a problem.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{thank you for that. what time is it?}
<C>__{ramesh}
<D>__{2:16.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{fuck me!}
<A>__{jared stands up and walks around the small room. the rest of the room goes silent. finally:}
<C>__{jared cohen }
<D>__{sam how long under normal operations would it take your people to clear that from our books?}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{the 1.2 trillion.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{all of it?}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{i don't know, a couple weeks?}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{weeks?}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{yes. but as you certainly know our business is selling and buying. it doesn't work for very long without both components. if we suddenly stop buying for a day or two that just doesn't hide under the rug, it gets out and this whole this thing comes to a end... and right quick.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{how many traders do we have left between your floor and petersen's?}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{i don't know, sixty.}
<A>__{ramesh has been looking down at the numbers while this conversation has been taking place.}
<C>__{ramesh}
<D>__{jared i've just been looking here a little closer, and it's these var numbers that are really setting this thing off.}
<A>__{jared holds up a hand to interrupt ramesh. jared nods his head, his eyes are perfectly still but his brain is racing.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{excuse me, i need to make a quick call.}
<A>__{jared calmly stands up and steps out of the room for a long moment. the room stays completely quiet the whole time he is gone. we hear nothing. it is awkward to say the least. he comes back in and sits down without missing a beat.}
<C>__{jared cohen }
<D>__{please...}
<C>__{ramesh}
<D>__{i was just saying, and just speaking completely off the record here, it won't be long before someone else starts putting these in and sees the exact same thing we are looking at here. if they haven't already.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{understood... and sarah, what value would you allow to be placed on those assets that might be left on the books, if they had to be?}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{why would they still be on the books?}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{because suddenly no one wants to buy them.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{oh fuck you sam... give me a fucking break, all at once?}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{without an active market, it could take weeks, months for me to value them correctly. you'd have to go block by block.}
<C>__{sam rogers}
<D>__{it's a very simple business jared. you and i talked about this last year...}
<A>__{jared turns around suddenly and cuts him off.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{sam.... will, peter, and..??}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{seth.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{seth, could you please excuse us for a few minutes.}
<A>__{they stand up and start to exit the room.}
<C>__{jared cohen }
<D>__{oh and peter? who else has seen this?}
<A>__{peter thinks that through.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no one... besides us here.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{and mr. dale.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{and can it really be that we don't know where eric dale is?}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{i'm afraid so. his wife tells us he hasn't come home yet...and the firm shut off his phone today.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{perfect. well, i need to know where he is.}
<A>__{will, seth, and peter leave the room and close the door behind them.}
