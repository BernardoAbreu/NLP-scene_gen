<B>__{yellow ripples past the camera and when it clears we see}
<A>__{through diesel smoke: a busing protest in progress. the school bus, full of black kids, is hit with bricks, rocks. n.b.: (this is not setting the live action in 1974; it is a historical montage, the background for costello's v.o.).}
<L>__{interior the autobody shop. day.}
<A>__{costello's profile passes in a dark room.}
<C>__{costello }
<D>__{years ago, we had the church. that was only a way of saying we had each other. the knights of columbus were head breakers. they took over their piece of the city.}
<L>__{exterior southie. various}
<A>__{the neighborhood. 1980's. we won't be here long. this isn't where costello ends up. it's where he began. liquor stores with shamrocked signs. men fishing near castle island. catholic schoolkids playing in an asphalted schoolyard.}
<C>__{costello }
<D>__{twenty years after an irishman couldn't get a job, we had the presidency. that's what the niggers don't realize. if i got one thing against the black chaps it's this. no one gives it to you. you have to take it.}

<A>__{costello comes in. the shop is one that sells papers, sundries, fountain drinks...and fronts a bookie operation.}

<P>__{(leaning over cluttered counter)}
<D>__{don't make me have to come down here again.}
<C>__{proprietor}
<D>__{won't happen again, mr. c.}
<A>__{the frightened proprietor hands over money. fifty bucks, a hundred, doesn't matter. costello is never the threatener. his demeanor is gentle, philosophical. almost a shrink's probing bedside manner. he has great interest in the world as he moves through it. as if he originally came from a different world and his survival in this one depends on close continual observation and analysis. young colin looks up. close on his eyes. he is fourteen or fifteen, but small for his age. bookish. costello eyes the proprietor's teenage daughter, working behind the counter. he takes a propane lighter, and, strangely, pays for it (the proprietor startled) and waits for change. he lights a more cigarette with the lighter.}
<C>__{young costello}
<D>__{carmen's developing into a fine young lady. you should be proud. you get your period yet, carmen?}
<A>__{the proprietor is uneasy. costello turns to young colin (about 14) staring at the local hero. costello reaches up above and behind the counter and takes down some cigarettes.}

<A>__{colin nods.}
<C>__{young costello }
<D>__{you live with your grandmother?}

<C>__{costello}
<D>__{get him three loaves of bread. and a couple of half gallons of milk. and some soup.}
<A>__{he goes over to the fridge and puts two half gallons of milk in the bag. some soup. costello turns to colin.}
<C>__{costello }
<D>__{do you like comic books?}
<A>__{colin nods. he adds a couple of comic books. when the proprietor looks at him, he takes out the money he put in his pocket and gives back half.}
<C>__{young costello}
<D>__{you do good in school?}
<A>__{young colin nods, holding the big bag of loot.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{young costello}
<D>__{that's good. i did good in school. they call that a paradox.}
<A>__{he gives some money to carmen.}
<C>__{young costello }
<D>__{buy yourself some makeup. keep the change.}
<A>__{looks intently at colin to see if he gets it. colin does.}
<C>__{young costello }
<D>__{you ever want to earn a little extra money, you come by l street. you know where i am on l street.}
<A>__{colin nods: everybody does.}
<C>__{young colin}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he pushes out with the bags of groceries. the proprietor can do shit about it. young costello watches young colin go off down a slummy street.}
<L>__{interior a church. morning. 1985 ish}
<A>__{young colin, the good boy, the very good boy, is serving at a funeral mass. various views of the church. stained glass light. the altar is still wreathed in the smoke of incense.}

<L>__{interior the autobody shop. day}
<A>__{costello is talking informally (we realize that this is a continuation of the philosophical talk, the shadowy pacing). young kids. useful young men. young colin, three years older, is among them.}
<C>__{young costello}
<D>__{church wants you in your place. what sort of man wants to be kept in his place? do this don't do that, kneel, stand, kneel, stand...i mean if you go for that sort of thing...}
<A>__{young colin, the recent altar boy, visibly doesn't go for that sort of thing.}
<C>__{young costello }
<D>__{i don't know what to do for you. a man makes his own way. no one gives it to you. you have to take it.}

<D>__{you decide to be something, you can be it. that's what they don't tell you, the church.}
<A>__{mister french is doing books off behind a window of dirty glass.}
<C>__{young costello }
<D>__{when i was your age, they would say, we become cops or criminals. today, what i'm saying to you is this: when you are facing a loaded gun...}
<A>__{very close on costello, holding colin's shoulder.}
<C>__{young costello }
<D>__{what's the difference?}
<A>__{ecu: colin's eyes swerve up. we are now on (mature) colin's eyes eyes. this is how the character transits the "age leap"...on the unchanging eyes.}
<B>__{the same eyes.}
<A>__{pull back to reveal: police trainees. (including barrigan, who is included in all colin's trainee scenes). colin is in the class, wearing a trainee's uniform. he has a notebook, a pen. writing.}
