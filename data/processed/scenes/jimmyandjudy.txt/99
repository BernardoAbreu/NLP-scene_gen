<A>__{i e. rodney's wunderland fire pit outside rodney's traier inside rodneys trailer parking area dinko's car }
<B>__{night}
<A>__{by the fire pit, the site where the teenage drunken of orgy took place, the bonfire has been put out and there are dozens of drunken passed out teenagers lying on the ground in sleeping bags and in tents. jimmy begins looking for judy with his night vision camera. he sees a girl lying on the ground in a sleeping bag with her back turned to the camera. her hair is identical to judy's, but we can't see her face. jimmy quietly steps over passed out teenagers, being extremely careful not to awaken anyone. jimmy accidently kicks a forty ounce beer bottle that causes a loud clanking sound of glass on glass. jimmy stops in his tracks in anticipation of someone waking up. no one does. jimmy continues to walk towards the girl who looks like judy. kneeling directly in front of her, jimmy puts his hands on her shoulder and pulls the girl's front region towards the camera. the girl flips over. it's not judy. and luckily, the girl is so severely intoxicated that she doesn't wake up. jimmy now makes his way over to a tent. he quietly unzips the mesh entrance and extends his arm out to video tape the inside. turns out, the person in the tent is just another passed out flunky loser. jimmy quickly takes his arm out of the tent. jimmy gives it one last go and continues to look for judy among the sea of passed out bodies lying on the ground. no luck. jimmy's not too far from uncle rodney's trailer. he decides to make his way up. he walks, using his nite shot to see, through the sea of bodies until he gets up to the entrance... outside rodney's trailer there's a cracked glass door leaning up against the woodpile by the entrance. jimmy steps around it, turning the lens at the glass. he briefly catches his reflection. he looks like hell warmed over, freshly bruised and cut from the recent beating. moving forward, jimmy makes it to the front door of uncle rodney's trailer. we hear music coming from inside. very slowly and very carefully, jimmy cracks the front door. inside rodney's trailer it's even darker inside of the trailer, but jimmy presses forward in spite of that fact, still using his nite shot to see. a boom box sits by the bed, still on, playing music. jimmy is scared shitless. in the corner of the room, in a make shift bunk, is uncle rodney sleeping with his arms wrapped around a girl in a spooning position. there's no doubt this time. it's definitely judy! they are both sound asleep and actually look very cozy lying together. jimmy slowly walks over towards them. each step is slower and slower, being extra careful not to wake them. once jimmy is within arm's length of the two of them he stops. he hesitates for a moment. he hasn't prepared himself for this particular situation and doesn't know exactly what to do. he continues filming them until he finally musters the courage to extend his non filming arm out to tap judy on the face. judy remains unconscious sleeping as jimmy gently taps the side of her cheek. jimmy slowly begins tapping harder and harder until the tap evolves into a poke. still nothing. thwack! an arm comes out of nowhere and grabs jimmy's poking hand. jimmy has woken up uncle rodney! the camera shakes out of control. uncle rodney screams at the top of his lungs:}
<C>__{uncle rodney}
<D>__{who the fuck...!}
<A>__{intense and furious wrestling ensues as uncle rodney flies out of frame then, in a split second: bam! a gunshot goes off. we hear a uncle rodney collapse, followed by more gun shots. the camera has fallen from jimmy's hand and dangles by the wrist strap. camera comes to rest on... uncle rodney's bloody face jimmy's shot and killed him. outside, footsteps hit the deck. buddy opens the door of the trailer.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{bam, bam, bam! three more rounds are fired, hitting buddy square in the chest, knocking him down. jimmy points the camera at a dead buddy on his back then whip pans it back to judy in the bed. finally we hear jimmy speak.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{judy, judy, wake up. fucking wake up!}
<A>__{outside we hear voices of some of rodney's other teens. jimmy acts fast. judy has been drugged and is mostly unconscious and groggy, but jimmy picks her up and gets her on her feet, shouldering her out the door. shot continues to... outside rodney's trailer we hear faint voices...}
<D>__{rodney's big guy #3}
<P>__{(faint)}
<D>__{hey! hey!}
<A>__{a distant gunshot fires, but we can't see what is going on. it's too dark and the camera is too shaky as they go to...}
<B>__{parking area}
<A>__{another distant shot, then jimmy gasps in pain. he's been shot, but decides to run, trying to carry a groggy judy anyway. their car is in sight as we hear guns going off and bullets whizzing by them. one hits dinko's car. jimmy opens the door, then places the passed out judy and the camera in the passenger seat, climbs over her, throwing the camera into judy's lap. we see him scramble to get the key in the ignition as we hear a bullet hit the driver's door. the car starts, and jimmy throws it into gear, flooring the gas as he speeds away.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{judy? judy?}
<A>__{nothing.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{judy wake up.}
<A>__{jimmy's voice begins to crack as he talks to tries to wake up judy.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{are you all right baby? please wake up judy. judy?}
<A>__{we don't know if judy is dead or alive. jimmy swerves to avoid something in the road sending the camera to the floor as camera shuts down.}
