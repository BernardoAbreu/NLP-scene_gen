<T>__{dissolve into :}
<A>__{the thump and scrape of industrial engines.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{but as i lay there, the sounds didn't fade but grew with the world.}
<A>__{the buzz of prop engines melt into the sound of a jet streaming overhead. cars, machines, radio broadcasts merge into a medley of music from this century jack benny, muddy waters, elvis, hendrix, sex pistols.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{and gradually the world didn't sound like the place i had left, but something different... better...}
<A>__{as we draw closer to the now vine covered tomb, sounds of the '70s, '80s, '90s persist...}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{a new fearless attitude had possessed the world, brave and godless. i began to wonder if it was not time to resurrect. but the thing that eventually brought me back the decisive thing really came like a bolt out of the blue.}
<A>__{guitars strike, drums crack and the music slams out, raw and dark.}
<B>__{series of glimpses}
<A>__{slender hands with long, painted nails, gothic rings, and a half pound of silver bracelets play their instruments. long hair, body piercings, celtic tattoos, and brightly colored nylons show a lot of pale, smooth flesh. in the confusion of glimpses, it's hard to tell who's a boy or girl, but they're all young and beautiful. breaking in on the cacophony of music comes one guitar closer and louder than the rest. a scraping roar, like a bandsaw being twisted into the most gorgeous, powerful chords, almost religious in its emotion.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{a music so sublime, so deeply vampiric, i had no doubt it could be heard in hades. i had no choice... it summoned me.}
<A>__{an ultra fast techno beat begins and the full sound of a band rushes in, creating a sense of vertigo with its energy.}
