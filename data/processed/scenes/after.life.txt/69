<L>__{interior funeral home. prep room day}
<A>__{close on anna's face. she looks empty. dispirited. just then something catches her attention... the light from the window glints off a pair of large scissors on the steel trolley. anna stumbles to the trolley. feeling her way through the semi darkness. grabs the scissors. just then she notices a body, covered with a white sheet, lying on a gurney in the corner. she turns away. scared. but then, almost against her will, she approaches the gurney. as if drawn to the body. she slowly pulls the sheet away... the dead body of an old woman. staring blindly at anna with cloudy opaque eyes. long greasy gray hair. shaken, anna pushes herself against the wall.}
