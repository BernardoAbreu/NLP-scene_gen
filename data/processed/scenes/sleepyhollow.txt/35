<L>__{exterior churchyard and cemetery later morning (time cut)}
<A>__{a psalm is heard read by steenwyck o.s. while a coffin is exhumed. ichabod guides the lifting. the coffin is put near the headstone "windsor." ichabod looks... at the church, steenwyck faces about fifty people who now take up the prayer. across the cemetery, two coffins, one small, one large, are pried open. "van garrett, 1799." killian leads the effort with young masbath's aid... the lids come off, revealing the headless bodies of a man and a little boy. young masbath backs away. at the "windsor" coffin, nails creak as ichabod opens the lid. we do not see inside, but when ichabod does, he is aghast. he looks to the men, angry.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{why was i not told of this?}
<A>__{no answer. killian arrives, nods solemnly.}
<C>__{killian}
<D>__{the widow windsor.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{is that all you say? look at her.}
<C>__{killian}
<D>__{it's not something people speak of openly. she did not remarry.}
<A>__{ichabod kneels, studying. now, we see: the belly of the headless corpse is bulbous, because the widow windsor was very far along in a pregnancy. ichabod notices: a tear in the cloth of widow's blouse. he reaches through the tear, feeling the stomach. he straightens, greatly troubled.}
