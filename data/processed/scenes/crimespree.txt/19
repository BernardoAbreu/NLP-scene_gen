<L>__{exterior o'hare airport morning}
<A>__{daniel and the crew get into a mini van taxi.}
<L>__{exterior chicago driving montage morning}
<A>__{quick cuts of the familiar sights of the city. the sears building. chicago board of trade building. grant park. then with each successive cut the beauty of the city seems to fade until we are in...}
<L>__{exterior street morning}
<A>__{an industrial section of the city. empty streets. run down buildings. graffiti filled walls and burnt out hulls of abandoned cars line the street. the taxi driver leans out his window.}
<C>__{taxi driver}
<D>__{are you sure you guys have the right address? this ain't no tourist area.}
<A>__{marcel looks at a piece of paper he is holding.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{yes. we are sure.}
<A>__{the taxi speeds off, leaving them standing on the sidewalk, their bags in a pile. suddenly, from out of nowhere three black toughs appear and walk over. daniel looks behind him and sees another two approaching from the rear. zero calmly sits down on one of the suitcases.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{let me handle this.}
<A>__{lamar, 30's, the leader of the group steps forward.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{hey, brother. what's happening, man?}
<A>__{sami raises his hand as if to greet lamar.}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{don't you brother me, motherfucker.}
<A>__{sami looks like an idiot with his hand up in the air. he casually lowers it. lamar looks over the group and grins.}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{what's in the bags?}
<C>__{julien}
<D>__{dirty underwear.}
<A>__{lamar forces a laugh.}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{dirty underwear. that's a good one. let me explain something to you. this is my street and you're gonna give me want i what or i'm gonna bust your heads open.}
<A>__{raymond steps forward and places his hand on lamar's arm.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{lamar, violence is never an answer to settling disputes. i can see you have a lot of anger... but this is not the way to get it out.}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{get outta my face!}
<A>__{lamar removes a knife. the others in his group bring out an assortment of clubs, chains and pipes.}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{now, are you going to give me the suitcases? or are we going to have to take them?}
<A>__{zero is still sitting on one of the suitcases.}
<C>__{zero}
<D>__{va te faire foutre!}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{he said to go fuck yourself.}
<C>__{zero}
<D>__{we are tired and bored with your bullshit. so, put that stupid little knife away before zero shoves it up your ass.}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{who is zero?}
<C>__{julien}
<D>__{he is.}
<C>__{lamar}
<P>__{(to julien)}
<D>__{he speaks about himself in the third person?}
<A>__{julien shrugs his shoulders.}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{maybe zero would like to get off his ass and take my knife from me?}
<C>__{zero}
<D>__{if you insist.}
<A>__{zero stands up and raises his hand. he is holding a .9mm glock. he aims it at lamar's head. lamar's brave exterior quickly fades now that he is looking down the barrel of the gun. the rest of his gang turns and runs away. zero aims the gun at his groin.}
<C>__{zero}
<D>__{leave now before zero shoots off those little raisins you call balls.}
<A>__{lamar runs away. daniel and the others smile at zero as they pick up their bags and walk towards a building. zero is left with sami who stares at him with disbelief.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{you put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? how stupid is that?}
<C>__{zero}
<D>__{zero did not put it in his bag. he put it in yours.}
<A>__{zero grins and walks away.}
