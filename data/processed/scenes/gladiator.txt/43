<L>__{exterior slave wagon train day}
<A>__{maximus' eyes slowly open inches away from his face a lion roars maximus lurches back. he looks around to realize he is in a filthy slave wagon. three other wagons slowly move over the desert landscape. exotic animals are caged in pens or led alongside the wagons: lions, panthers, zebras, a giraffe. a dozen slaves are chained together alongside sacks of spices and other cargo. bedouin slave traders jabber in a surreal babel of foreign tongues. and someone is looking at him. juba, a striking african, is gazing at him impassively as he chews something. juba is also chained.}

<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{am i in hades?}
<C>__{juba}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{juba spits what he has been chewing into his hands and moves to maximus.}
<C>__{juba}
<D>__{for your wound...}
<A>__{maximus stares at him.}
<C>__{juba}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{for your wound.}
<A>__{maximus looks down the bloody wound at his side. juba carefully places his poultice over the wound maximus hisses in pain juba massages the poultice into the wound gently as:}
<C>__{juba}
<D>__{if you die in the wagons they feed you to the lions... the lions are worth more than we are. i think we are worth more than the zebras though. so they don't feed us to them.}
<A>__{maximus stares at him. juba looks down at him with the barest hint of a smile.}
<C>__{juba}
<D>__{i'm not sure about the giraffe.}
