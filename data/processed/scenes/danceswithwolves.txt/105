<A>__{it's raining. high on a hill, the indian escort waits stoically, horses heads bowed in the drizzle. on the haunches of one of the ponies is a single deer. down below, wind in his hair and kicking bird are still mounted and converse with dunbar using sign talk.}

<D>__{no, i haven't seen any buffalo. are you hungry? i have food... are you hungry?}
<A>__{dunbar suggests they take some of his supplies but kicking bird will not stand for this. he waves dunbar off. the three men say their goodbyes, and dunbar as usual throws a wave to the six men on the hill. unexpectedly, one of them returns it and the other five react with surprise.}

<D>__{nothing i have been told about these people is correct. they are not beggars and thieves. they are not the bogeymen they have been made out to be.}
<A>__{kicking bird and wind in his hair disappear over the hill, followed by their escort. lightning bursts far out on the prairie.}
