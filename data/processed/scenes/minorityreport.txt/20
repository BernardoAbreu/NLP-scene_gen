<L>__{interior a banquet washington, d.c. night}
<A>__{anderson, in black tie, with lisa in a shimmering blue gown at his side, moves through a huge room filled high level government officials and politicians.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{a little bit of me dies every time i come to one of these things.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{it's only a party, paul.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{i'd never have let them appoint me to precrime if i'd have known this was going to be part of it.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you're exactly what precrime needed. an amazing homicide cop and a real person in an unreal job.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{the public loves the precogs. but they give people the creeps, too. you're something they understandp a regular cop running things.}
<A>__{anderson sighs as he looks around the elegantly appointed banquet hall.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{let's invite all these irregular assholes over for a barbecue. burgers and beer think they'd come?}
<A>__{a barrel chested man with a great shock of pepper gray hair, senator malcolm, 58, takes hold of anderson's elbow from behind.}
<D>__{senator malcolm i'd come, mr. director. and i'd make all the other assholes come with me.}
<A>__{lisa reddens, anderson gives an embarrassed cough. the senator laughs and claps him on the back.}
<C>__{senator malcolm }
<D>__{nice job this morning. another negative homicide. the precogs never let us down.}
<A>__{mrs. malcolm smoothly occupies lisa, while the senator eases anderson in the opposite direction}
<C>__{senator malcolm}
<D>__{i have a dream, paul.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{i know you do, senator.}
<C>__{senator malcolm}
<D>__{hundreds of precogs. not just predicting murders, but predicting all crimes. burglary, arson, assaults ...}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{how about jaywalking? littering? now there's a crime.}
<A>__{the senator smiles through his teeth.}
<C>__{senator malcolm}
<D>__{i don't want a police state, you know that. but we have an opportunity here, and}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{no sir, we don't have that opportunity. there are only three precogs. they're a lucky accident of nature. there are no more.}
<C>__{senator malcolm}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we can make more. just give me your support. help me increase funding for the precog engineering project.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{precogs aren't sheep or pigs. seeing into the future is a gift, a nonreproducible event.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{there was only one mozart, and there are only three precogs.}
<C>__{senator malcolm}
<D>__{fuck mozart. the people want to be safe. they want that more than they want food or love.}
<A>__{he gestures at the room full of glittering partygoers.}
<C>__{senator malcolm }
<D>__{look at us it's 2040 and we've wrapped ourselves up in the 1950's like a big security blanket. why? because we want to feel like they felt. safe.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{senator, a world filled with hundreds of precogs is not my idea of a safe place.}
<A>__{the senator gives it one last shot.}
<C>__{senator malcolm}
<D>__{sure could use your help, paul.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{i decline, senator. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{senator malcolm}
<P>__{(icily)}
<D>__{don't think i will come to your barbecue after all.}
<A>__{the senator moves off. anderson stands stiffly among the sea of black ties and exquisite fifties dresses.}
