<L>__{interior school auditorium night}
<A>__{quoyle enters a packed auditorium, festooned for christ's birthday with every trimming imaginable. rough fishermen in black jackets they wear once a year, women in finery, schoolkids at their well scrubbed best, antsy with anticipation. the buzz is audible, palpable. no broadway opening could hope for this level of eagerness. as quoyle comes down the aisle, we see faces we know. boys from nutbeem's party. billy pretty with jack and mrs. buggit. alvin yark and his bird like wife. the old timer who sold quoyle his boat. mavis bangs with an empty seat next to her, must be saved for agnis. all the kids from daycare. still, quoyle searching for the face he doesn't find. and finally... ...to the third row, where dennis and beety have saved him a seat. beety gives him a peck on the cheek, and he smiles, settling in, nervous as hell, just as... ...the school principal, still dressed for england, walks to the mike at center stage. holds up her hands like the disciplinarian she prides herself on being, and they quiet pretty fast.}
<C>__{principal}
<D>__{your friends and neighbors, and most of all, your children. have worked hard to bring you the best pageant ever.}
<A>__{thunderous applause, whistling, stamping. she is frustrated for a moment. then, waves cheerily against the din, shouting...}
<C>__{principal}
<D>__{let the festivities begin!}
<A>__{and runs off stage, as we dissolve through : a series of angles... ...the big ugly guy who led the raid on poor nutbeem's boat stands in a threadworn suit bulging with his bulk, singing danny boy in the sweetest tenor one could dream of. pan an audience, rapt, motionless. pavarotti never had more respect. ...bunny and marty walk timidly to the front of the stage. marty dressed in christmas reds and greens. bunny all in blue, which does look good on her. kids call out their names. the place falls quiet. and the girls begin to sing a plaintive west african hymn in small brave voices that sometimes harmonize. it is unexpected and breathtakingly courageous. two dads in the third row have tears flooding their eyes...}
<C>__{dennis }
<D>__{not bad, my kid, eh?}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{i will say. she's as good as mine.}
<A>__{...agnis hamm walks out alone onto the stage, wearing a brown jersey, tweed skirt, yellow stockings and red slippers. she has an odd look on her face, all serious and curious. the laughter and calls die away to silence. suddenly, one of her feet scratches at the stage, her arms become wings, and with a crooning and cackling she metamorphoses into a peevish hen protecting an egg. the house comes down with laughter and unison applause. quoyle glances back at mavis bangs who puts her fingers between her teeth and whistles in pure delight. ...wavey prowse walks onto the rear of the stage, in a long black smock, carrying her accordion. she turns to the wings, nods, and out comes little herry clacking across the stage in tap shoes. a beat of silence. mom calls out: one, two, three, rolls into a savage hornpipe and herry commences the jig quoyle once glimpsed through a window. three hundred heels coming stomping down in perfect rhythm and lift herry into a joyous bouncing, rattling performance that builds in intensity until the finish. he runs to the edge of the stage, bows deep from the waist, stands beaming in their applause. then races offstage, his mom following with dignity, and we go with her into the wings... once there, wavey slips out of the smock, revealing to the dimness of the wings, that she is wearing dancer's tights over drop dead legs. a close fitting tunic covered with sequins and glass bugles, crystal diamonds, and dozens more glittering baubles that send a shimmer of prisms with her every breath. herry hands her a top hat, a cane, and... ...she stalks back onto the stage, her lithe body strutting and glinting. a hush of stupefaction falls, only to be washed away by shouts and whistles, the kind of which have not been heard since gypsy rose lee startled her first roomful of rubes. in the bedlam... ...she twirls the top hat on one finger, flips it up in a double somersault, catching it square on her head. she leans on her cane and when at last they quiet...}

<D>__{we all know billy pretty's ways. never save fifty cents, if you can save a dollar.}
<A>__{she winks. they laugh. billy laughing loudest.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{well, last feb'ry, billy wants t'get his grandfather clock repaired. calls old leander mesher. local call. no charge.}
<A>__{twirls the cane recklessly. in the third row, a goggle eyed quoyle couldn't blink if he tried.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{well, says leander, the big cost is pickup and delivery. got t'charge fifty dollars, each way. two strong boys. gasoline. air in the tires!}
<A>__{that's right.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{there's no cost for air in yer tires!, says bill. get wi' th'times, he's told. tis called inflation!}
<A>__{waggles her eyebrows, groucho style. they are busting their guts laughing. connoisseurs of wit.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{billy lives at the top of the hill, leander at the bot tom, doncha know. so billy gets a rope, hoists the grandfather up on his back. and muttering the words fifty bucks...}
<A>__{she puts her toe out, slips wildly, windmilling her arms, pantomiming as she bends double under the phantom clock.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{mite slick. four feet thick a ice.}
<A>__{tears are streaming from a hundred eyes and more.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{meanwhile, at the bottom, auntie fizzard, 91 years young, sets out in her non slip galoshes and her cane with the rubber tip. didn't yer, dearie?}
<A>__{bows to the old gal in the front row, who is scarlet faced in hysterics, as all around her applaud. wavey becomes her, inching along, casting fierce glances right and left to warn the world.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{meanwhile, at the top...}
<A>__{she is billy once more, beneath his burden, her long legs stutter stepping to one side, then the other, slipping, skidding, the howling all around her threatening to shatter walls, and...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{...over he goes, clock side down, and pickin' up speed!}
<A>__{miming the wild ride as they roar...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{...eight blocks, nine, missing everything like a miracle, zeroing in on...}
<A>__{she becomes auntie fizzard once more, shuffling, looking left, right, and suddenly up wild eyed!}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{clips 'er inta the snow bank!}
<A>__{nods sadly. leaning on her cane. when at last they quiet.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{just two galoshes stickin' outta the snow. she digs 'er way out. brushes herself off. looks at him sprawled like a turtle on his back, tied to his massive burden. she says...}
<A>__{she says.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{you there! billy pretty!}
<A>__{levels a dead eyed killer gaze.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{why can't you wear a wristwatch like ever'body else?}
<A>__{the place comes down like a house of cards. bedlam surrounds quoyle who sits still as a stone. too dazzled to breathe.}
