<L>__{interior the carousel again day}
<A>__{gondorff, dried off now and in a new set of clothes, is pulling up the shades of the large facing windows of the carousel building. the morning light pours in, illuminating fully for the first time the ornate merry go round and its massive oaken horses. hooker watches him go about his business. billie calls down from the mezzanine which surrounds the carousel.}
<C>__{billie}
<D>__{you feeling all right this morning, henry?}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{fine, billie.}
<C>__{billie}
<D>__{you mind opening the round a little early today? we got some business coming in before hours.}
<A>__{gondorff waves okay.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<P>__{(to hooker)}
<D>__{great little countess, that billie. runs a good house up there, too. one of the few left that luciano doesn't own.}
<A>__{gondorff walks around on the carousel, checking straps, bearing and poles. hooker follows him.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(getting impatient)}
<D>__{gondorff, you gonna teach me the big con or not?}
<C>__{gondorff}
<P>__{(on his back, checking underneath one of the horses)}
<D>__{you didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{i wanna play for lonnegan.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{you know anything about him?}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{yeh, he croaked luther. what else do i gotta know.}
<A>__{gondorff just sits tight and waits for him to cool off.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(waving gondorff off,}
<D>__{embarrassed at his}
<P>__{own outburst)}
<D>__{aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<P>__{(going over to start the machinery)}
<D>__{and a packing company, a chain of savings and loans and half the politicians in chicago and new york. there ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{i will take him anyway.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<P>__{(whirling on him)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(like steel)}
<D>__{'cause i don't know enough about killin' to kill him.}
<A>__{it's the right answer. gondorff didn't know it himself until now.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{you can't do it alone, ya know. it takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{we'll get by without 'em.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{this isn't like playin' winos on the street. you gotta do more than outrun the guy.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(incensed)}
<D>__{i never played for winos.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<P>__{(going right on, ignoring hooker's remark)}
<D>__{you gotta keep lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money. and no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{you're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{right down to my socks, turkey. if i'da been half as scared a that lop ear, i wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em. lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{then you'll do it?}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{if i can find a mob that'll risk it. but no matter what happens, i don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got.}
<A>__{hooker nods. gondorff switches on the carousel and steps back to admire his handiwork. the carousel makes a grinding sound, does a few lurches and stops cold.}
