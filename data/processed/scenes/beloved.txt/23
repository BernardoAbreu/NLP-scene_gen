<L>__{interior 124 bluestone road day.}
<A>__{sethe opens the front door and enters, with paul behind her, hanging his shoes by the laces over his shoulder. as he follows her in; a pool of red, undulating light forms around him. it worries him.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you got company?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{on and off.}
<A>__{the light undulates faster and faster, extending all the way to the kitchen at the end of the hall. frightened, paul steps back out the door.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{good god! what kind of evil you got in there?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{it's not evil..it's just..just sad. come on. just step through.}
<A>__{sethe reaches out her hand. paul tentatively takes it and is lead through the red light of the hallway, through to the kitchen where it ends. as he walks through, we can see paul affected by the light. it is sad. a sadness that touches him, welling up inside until tears are brimming in his eyes. he reaches the normal light of the kitchen and steps out of it.}
