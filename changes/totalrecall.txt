<LOC>__{EXT. DESERT - DAY}
<ACTION>__{All we can see, filling the entire frame is a flame-orange sky...almost like the sky from the burning of Atlanta in "Gone with the Wind". SUPERIMPOSE:  Presenter credit. PAN DOWN lower and lower until we see the terrain below... the desert.  There is no vegetation whatever, just sand and odd-shaped rock formations.  The air is filled with red dust, which alternately obscures and then reveals the image. CAMERA MOVES FORWARD optically - enlarging the film grain in the process.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{SLOW DISOLVE OPENING CREDITS BEGIN.}
<ACTION>__{ANOTHER SHOT of a barren landscape, once more with bizarre rocks.  Dust.  Sound of wind.  CAMERA MOVES FORWARD again.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{DISSOLVE.}
<ACTION>__{ANOTHER LANDSCAPE, but this time, in the distance are some enormous plastic domes.  Sunlight striking them and reflect- ing causes brilliant rainbows.  CAMERA optically tracks toward the dome, seen in tantalizingly indistinct fashion through the red dust.  DISSOLVE... ANOTHER ANGLE, and, in the distance, on the horizon of the arid landscape is a huge SPHINX-LIKE STRUCTURE.  (It is reminiscent of the Egyptian sphinx, but both body and face, though gargoyle-like, are different in design.)  There are some large pyramids not far from the sphinx.  CAMERA MOVES optically FORWARD.  DISSOLVE. CAMERA is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front. It moves (combination of zoom and optical printer move) towards the eyes, which appear to be red gems. As CAMERA APPROACHES one of the eyes, it appears to be stained red glass, as in a temple.  Suddenly there is a terrific explosion and the glass shatters into millions of fragments which hurtle toward the camera...}
<LOC>__{INT. CATACOMB BELOW "SPHINX" - DAY}
<ACTION>__{A MAN wearing a LIGHTWEIGHT THERMAL SUIT is RUNNING THROUGH THIS LABYRINTH of TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES under him, as if in an earthquake.  We cannot clearly make out his face, especially since he wears some kind of BREATHING APPARATUS over a portion of it. The surface of the tunnel's "walls" is curious;  the walls are, again, bright reddish orange, and a composite of two different substances:  rough-textured, clay-like material and red quartz, which glistens like crystal. The man throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fear- fully, as he runs.  His HANDS are SPLATTERED with BLOOD. Because of this, the RED GLOW, the air of FEAR to the man, and the GROUND HEAVING and BUCKLING, there is almost a SATANIC suggestion to the scene. Suddenly, up AHEAD of the man, there appears a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT.  He SEES IT, and runs even faster towards it. We are ALMOST UP TO THE LIGHT, and we SEE HANDS REACHING OUT OF THE LIGHT TOWARDS US... that seem to beckon him to}
<ACTION_ALT>__{SAFETY.}
<ACTION>__{ABRUPTLY, the ENTIRE SCREEN GOES RED, BUT IN REVERSE NEGATIVE; with YELLOW LAYOVERS.  (So that all the images we see -- ENTIRE FRAME -- are small YELLOW AREAS diffused on a RED BACKGROUND.)  It is much like looking at a tableau made out of molten lava.}

<LOC>__{INT. BEDROOM IN SMALL APARTMENT - MORNING}
<ACTION>__{DOUGLAS QUAIL and his wife KRISTEN, are asleep in bed. Gradually the room lights BRIGHTEN.  The CLOCK CHIMES and begins SPEAKING in a soft, feminine voice.}

<ACTION>__{Quail reaches out and shuts the clock off.  Then he sits up in bed. He swings his legs out from under the covers and sits on the edge of the bed.  He puts on his glasses and sits, lost  in thought. He is a good-looking but conventional man in his early thirties.  He seems rather in awe of his wife, who is attractive and rather off-hand towards him. Kirsten pulls on her robe, lights a cigarette, sits fishing for her slippers.}

<LOC>__{INT. KITCHENETTE - MORNING}
<ACTION>__{Quail and Kirsten sit at a small table, eating breakfast. On the WALL is projected the front page of a NEWSPAPER. Drinking his coffee, Quail studies the wall with the air of a man who had his "node stuck in a newspaper," ignoring his wife. The newspaper headline reads:  "RIOTING ON MARS OVER WATER TAX." His wife is reading a different article:  "Four Women Rape Man in Park."}

<CHAR>__{QUAIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's just media talk.  They're...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(indicating the protesters)}
<DIAL>__{...just a minority.  They're powerless.}
<CHAR>__{KIRSTEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, there's a lot of things we need around here before we waste our money on a trip to Mars.  We're broke.  I'm just a slave around this dump. Now if you were capable of finding a better job....}

<LOC>__{EXT. CITY - EARLY MORNING}
<ACTION>__{CAMERA TRACKS with Quail as he walks along the busy modern street towards a subway station.  Modern cars (out of focus) pass noiselessly between the camera and Quail.  There is a plaintive tune being played on violin.  Quail pauses and gives a wad of notes to the aged violinist, then walks on briskly.}
<LOC>__{INT. SUBWAY STATION - EARLY MORNING}
<ACTION>__{Quail enters the station.  Everybody must pass through a weapons check before proceeding to the platforms. TWO ARMED GUARDS stand at either side, as commuters pass through an electronic beam.  On a screen, the entire body of each person is seen in X-ray.  All of them are clearly carrying a gun in their inside coat pocket.}
<CHAR>__{GUARD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No weapon again, Mr. Quail?}
<CHAR>__{QUAIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I keep forgetting, Herb.  They frighten me.}
<CHAR>__{GUARD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah?  Well, it's the law, Mr. Quail.  Has been since 1990 they tell me.  Tomorrow - ya carry ya gun or ya get reported.}

<CHAR>__{QUAIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay.  Herb, okay.}
<ACTION>__{Quail walks on to the track area.  The train arrives. Signs above each approaching car say "CAR FULL", "ROOM FOR 10 PERSONS", etc.  Quail goes to a carriage marked "NEW CAR".}
<LOC>__{INT. URBAN TRANSIT TRAIN - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The doors open and the crowd surges on.  Quail grabs a seat.  At intervals throughout the car are VIDEO MONITORS on which a NEWS BROADCAST is showing.}
<CHAR>__{NEWSCASTER } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{-- more violence today from Mars's strike-torn ore colonies --}
<ACTION>__{Everyone ignores the broadcast -- except Quail, who perks instantly at the word "Mars." The NEWSCASTER is a young black man.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(continuing)}
<DIAL>__{...but Earth Intelligence Operations Director Vilos Cohaagen, clearly worried about the damage to Mars's all important tourist industry was today dismissive of the dissident groups....}
<ACTION>__{TV scene switches to a press conference.  COHAAGEN, sur- rounded by AIDES, steps in front of a podium packed with news network microphones and cameras.  Cohaagen is a striking, intense man with an obvious air of power.}
<CHAR>__{COHAAGEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We're dealing with a bunch of extremists and unrepresentative lunatics.  Mars is a happy and prosperous protectorate of Earth... and will remain so.}
<ACTION>__{The train stops at another station and more people pile on. Quail tries to watch the broadcast through the bodies passing in front of him and intermittently blocking the image.}
<CHAR>__{REPORTER } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{There have been some criticisms, sir....}
<CHAR>__{COHAAGEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I have no further comment.}
<ACTION>__{The news conference ends and a bright looking young man comes on the screen.  Quail continues to watch, though not as interested, initially, as he was by the Mars story. Few of the other passengers bother looking at the screen.}
<CHAR>__{ANNOUNCER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good morning, commuters.  This portion of your trip is brought to you by Rekall, Inc.  Do you have a dream that never came true?  Do you aspire - but only perspire?  Has the great adventure passed you by?  Then come to... REKALL, where what might have been will have been. For the memories of a lifetime... REKALL.}
<ACTION>__{Quail watches the commercial through to the end, but doesn't seem to take it very seriously.  He glances away as a card comes on the screen with REKALL's numbers.}
<LOC>__{INT. QUAIL'S OFFICE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Quail is seated at a computer console in a vast beehive of a room.  Numerous people are typing information onto the screens.  Quail pauses in his typing, thoughtful.  He then types in a little more information, then pauses again. On the screen, a sentence types itself... WHY HAVE YOU STOPPED?  REQUEST MORE INFORMATION. Quail read it and continues.}
<LOC>__{INT. McCLANE'S OFFICE - REKALL - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Scene opens on a CU of McCLANE, a genial, bubbling, enthus- iastic man.}
<DIAL>__{McCLANE We're all dreamers, Douglas. But here at Rekall, dreams are our business.}
<ACTION>__{He presses a button on his desk and the chairs on which they are seated appear to be in outer space.  Countless stars glitter all around.  Startlingly, a comet whizzes by. Quail is amazed.  McClane grins and presses the button again.  The scene changes to a beautiful underwater coral reef.  Multi-colored fish swim around the chairs and desk.}
<CHAR>__{QUAIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But... is the process really that effective?  A false memory!? McCLANE}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(shaking his head; smiling)}
<DIAL>__{We prefer the term "extra- factual implant".  Your memory will be complete in every way.  You will have gone to Mars.  We guarantee that.}
<CHAR>__{QUAIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is it in any way dangerous? I mean, the medical techniques? McCLANE Not when you deal with qualified operators - like us.}
<ACTION>__{He presses the button again and the normal office returns. Quail looks around, impressed.}
<CHAR>__{QUAIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's just - incredible. McCLANE And look at our follow-up program!}
<ACTION>__{He puts items on the desk as he talks.}
<DIAL>__{McCLANE}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(continuing)}
<DIAL>__{Space-flight ticket stub... passport... vaccination certificates... matchbooks from Martian Nouvelle Cuisine Restaurants, souvenirs, post cards... even names of people you met - now back there - who you can call and discuss your trip with... by the way, we plant these things where you'll come across them at random in the future.}
<CHAR>__{QUAIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But... I'll know I hired you. That'll destroy the whole illusion. McCLANE}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(smiling; self- satisfied)}
<DIAL>__{But you won't remember me, or having been here.}
<CHAR>__{QUAIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I won't? McCLANE Your money back if you do! We've never paid out yet.}
<ACTION>__{Quail slumps backs in his chair, overwhelmed.}
<DIAL>__{McCLANE}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(continuing)}
<DIAL>__{And we have a special this month, for only two-hundred thousand dollars more.}

<DIAL>__{You can have a new identity for the duration of the trip. Pick one.}

<CHAR>__{QUAIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{"Intelligence Agent"... wouldn't that be dangerous?  I might attack.... McCLANE}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(airily)}
<DIAL>__{No.  No.  You're a retired agent.  Mars was your last mission and you're never to break your cover.  But you'll have got the girl, killed the baddies, and saved the Universe.  Not bad, eh?}
<CHAR>__{QUAIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't know... about the whole thing... it's all such a fake.  I won't really have gone.  I won't really.... McCLANE}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(kind but firm)}
<DIAL>__{Let's face it, Douglas, you, and millions of people like you have no chance of ever getting to Mars and you'd never qualify as a secret agent for EIO.  This - REKALL - is the only way to achieve your dream.}
<ACTION>__{He gets up and walks around to Quail's chair.}
<DIAL>__{McCLANE}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(continuing)}
<DIAL>__{Think about it, Douglas. Think, too, what a terrible boor a real holiday is. Lost tickets, endless arguments, lousy hotels, missed connections, rotten weather... Rekall will supply you with perfect, happy memories.}
<ACTION>__{Quail is thoughtful, willing to be totally convinced.}
<LOC>__{INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Quail is sitting, distracted, in an uncomfortable modern chair.  Kirsten is watching a near-pornographic film on TV.  She casually lights a cigarette.}

<CHAR>__{KIRSTEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah?  Who's going to report me?  You?... wimp....}

<LOC>__{INT. MEMORY STUDIO - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Quail is stretched out on a plush reclining couch, alongside some strange-looking lab equipment, wearing a hospital-type smock.  In the b.g. hovers a TECHNICIAN, adjusting some instrumentation (discreet banks of computers, etc.) -- that apparently relates to the lab equipment next to Quail.  The room in a dim, soothing booth, lit by indirect lighting. Quail looks a little concerned as he studies all the instrumentation next to him -- as one always does at the dentist's, looking at the drills. The door opens abruptly, in walks a cute-looking LITTLE OLD LADY, wearing a JOGGING SUIT.  (A RUTH GORDON-TYPE.)}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(at machine)}
<DIAL>__{Okay -- that's it.}
<ACTION>__{Now, Lull extends a long rubber tube, a hypodermic needle attached to it.  Quail eyes it warily.  She swabs the back of his hand in preparation, notices his apprehension.}
<CHAR>__{LULL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now, just relax, kid.  This ain't gonna hurt.  Just a controlled drip of Narkadine. When you're under, I'll just ask ya a few questions, nothin' real personal, just full details of yer private life so's we can tailor the wish-fulfillment program to your needs.}
