<L>__{interior grandpa reaches trailer}
<A>__{grandpa samuel reaches sits in a taped and tuckered easy chair, his alert black eyes moving from side to side. we recognize him from the sweat lodge ceremony at looks twice' although today he wears a straw cowboy hat giving him a more youthful look despite a face like a map of the badlands. he wears a vest over a western shirt, baggy work slacks, old cowboy boots. his brown wrinkled hands run over the top of the marlboro pack as if he's reading braille. crow horse sits across from him on a stool. ray leans on one of the plain green walls, looking uncomfortable. a three foot adhesive fly strip hangs from the ceiling, thick with dead ones. there is a black and white tv with sesame street wailing, honking and guffawing through static. grandpa fixes his eyes on ray for only split seconds at a time but one gets the feeling he's doing an incredibly deep reading of the young man. slowly, he sits up focusing intensely on ray. he begins to speak. a hoarse, strained, string of lakota, spoken like it used to be, gesturing toward ray. when he finishes, he sits back in his chair. ray looks intrigued.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{he wants to know if you ever watch the cookie monster. he says the cookie monster is not to be trusted a trickster.}
<A>__{ray looks puzzled. crow horse laughs bull wild as grandpa takes up a fly swatter and takes out a big horsefly. the old man begins speaking indian again.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{he says there's something wrong with big bird he's crazy,}
<P>__{(stops laughing)}
<D>__{he says you stopped the inipi ceremony last night...?}
<A>__{crow horse turns a questioning look at ray. ray doesn't flinch.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{but he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{he knows me?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{he says he saw you in a vision some time ago.}
<A>__{crow horse stops translating suddenly even though the old man continues speaking. crow horse looks concerned, and asks a question in lakota. we don't know what he's asking but the tone is absolute amazement. this question triggers an exchange between he and grandpa, the old one getting angry. grandpa wins.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{i guess he had this vision some time ago, in the moon of the popping trees uh, back in the winter. he says you come from wasi'cu city in the east but that your people... way back... are of the minniconjou sioux. but you yourself don't know that.}
<A>__{ray's brow is drawn tense as he stares at the old indian, absorbing the translation. grandpa speaks more fervently now, incorporating indian sign. each time grandpa does the hard sioux hand slap, ray blinks.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{he says he knew you'd be coming to bear creek. he was told. it is the will of tunkasilia the grandfather that you come here. he says let's smoke the caanunpa the sacred pipe, symbol of truth. so that there will be no lies between us.}
<A>__{the old man has taken a long wooden stem and a red stone bowl from a beaded pipe bag. he joins the two together then begins offering a pinch of tobacco to the four directions. while this goes on, ray fidgets.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what's he smoke in that?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{sacred herbs. tobacco. don't worry, we don't smoke no mexican agriculture in the pipe. that's a white man's myth. this is a sacrament.}
<A>__{the old man is offering the pipe to ray.}
<C>__{grandpa}
<D>__{mltaku oyasin.}
<A>__{ray looks at grandpa. the old man offers the pipe again.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{you don't smoke with him, it means you're hiding something.}
<A>__{ray takes the pipe, looks at it... then passes it to crow horse. the big indian takes it from ray, giving him a long eye, then offering the pipe to the directions before smoking. crow horse puffs hard, eyes closed, then slowly releases some smoke upward. ray watches it climb and fade. the old man then takes up an old turtle shell rattle. he speaks.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{he says wakan. sacred. five hundred year old turtleshell rattle, passed down from the grandfathers. heavy duty.}
<A>__{he shakes the rattle very slightly, moving it in front of ray. he speaks just above a whisper.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{he says, it is good. the spirits are here. the spirits want to know what you're doing here?}
<A>__{ray smirks.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{tell him i'm trying to find the man who murdered leo fast elk. ask him if he knows where he is.}
<A>__{crow horse asks the old man in lakota. no answer. the pipe is back to grandpa, and he offers it to the directions, to the earth then upward before smoking himself. he begins to speak again. passionately. in long glottal sioux sentences, adding sign, fingers crossing, brushing an arm, a slap here and there, he is working himself into an excited state, and ray keeps looking at crow horse, very interested in the old man's answer. finally grandpa's breath comes up short and wheezing, he ends his oratory with a solid hand slap.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{he said he doesn't know.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{he just did the gettysburg address in sioux. what did he say?}
<A>__{crow horse ignores him. grandpa speaks again. more hand language. the old man is staring at ray while whispering to crow horse. he strokes his badger claw necklace. crow horse looks at ray and seems hesitant to translate this new piece of information.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{uh... grandpa likes to trade; no one stops by here without gettin' stuck in the old indian barter. he, uh... he likes your shades.}
<A>__{grandpa smiles toothlessly. ray who has his driving glasses in hand, lifts them to say "these?" but grandpa sees it as an accepted deal, and swiftly removes his necklace. he holds it out. ray slowly, hesitantly surrenders his sunglasses, and takes the necklace. crow horse bursts into laughter and so does grandpa, enjoying a good trade. he draws a hand through the air in a sort of horizontal karate chop, meaning done deal. ray looks confused. out of his element. and out of his shades. another fly gets snagged on sticky tape.}
