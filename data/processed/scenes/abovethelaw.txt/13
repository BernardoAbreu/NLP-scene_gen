<A>__{a baptism in progress. nico years older than when we last saw him, is standing beside sara, his lovely wife watching a 60 ish priest, father genarro, finish the final ritual on nico's infant son julian. the priest straightens the baby's baptismal garment, tugging the cloth around the little fellow's crotch. smiles from friends and relatives clustered proudly around. several cops, some in uniform are amongst them. nico grabs his son from genarro with a theatrical protective motion, tugs up the little boy's garment, kisses him smack on the bare butt. laughter from all as nico holds the lad high and proud. he puts his arm around sara.}
