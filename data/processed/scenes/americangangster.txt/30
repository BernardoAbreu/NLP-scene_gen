<L>__{exterior parking lot newark night}
<A>__{all the other cars are gone. rivera climbs into richie's with coffee and a coke in a bag, hands him the can.}
<C>__{rivera}
<D>__{think he made us?}
<A>__{richie doesn't know. glances at his watch. cranes in his seat to look behind them.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{you called for the warrant? where are they?}
<C>__{rivera}
<D>__{i just called. i called and walked back here and ten seconds has gone by.}
<A>__{richie watches an attendant lock up, listens to the street lamps buzz, grows impatient. indicating the other car:}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{we saw him with the slips, javy.}
<C>__{rivera}
<D>__{you saw policy slips? you saw grocery bags. you don't know what's in them.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{yes, i do, and so do you, don't give me that bullshit }
<C>__{rivera}
<D>__{what's the rush? half an hour the warrant'll be here }
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i got night school.}
<C>__{rivera}
<D>__{guess you're going to miss it.}
<P>__{(rivera sips at his coffee; then:)}
<D>__{you know, what you were saying before about throwing up in front of people money will take that feeling away.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{not when it's less.}
<C>__{rivera}
<D>__{less than what.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{than what i make now.}
<C>__{rivera}
<D>__{no lawyer on earth makes less than a cop.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{they do in the prosecutor's office. three thousand less.}
<C>__{rivera}
<D>__{you're fuckin kidding me.}
<A>__{richie isn't kidding. rivera stares at him like he's crazy. richie checks his watch. he's waited long enough.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{fuck this }
<C>__{rivera}
<D>__{richie }
<A>__{richie gets out, opens the trunk, grabs a slimjim and bolt cutters, cuts through a gate chain and strides to the accountant's car, rivera following. richie trips the passenger door lock and pulls at the trunk release, and, as he comes around back to search it }
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{check inside.}
<A>__{rivera may as well; the damage to the case, if there is one anymore, is done. he crawls inside the car to look under the seats and in the glove compartment. gravely }
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{javy ...}
<A>__{richie's staring into the trunk like there's a body inside. rivera comes over, takes a look, sees it's money: stacks of it rubber banded together, spilling from grocery bags more than either of them has ever seen. as the trunk closes }
