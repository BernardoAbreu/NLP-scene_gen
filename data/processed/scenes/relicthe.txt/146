<L>__{interior hall of the dinosaurs night}
<A>__{jonathan and hobbes take cover behind one of the dinosaurs and hide. mbwun sees jonathan, lifts both claws, swings at the skeleton, sending it crashing down! jonathan screams, hobbes is caught and falls. he scrambles into a corner, whimpering, as pendergast and margo appear in the door. fifteen more s.w.a.t. team members with rifles now line the hole in the roof. they all point their guns at mbwun.}
<C>__{ippolito}
<D>__{get back! we're going to shoot!}
<A>__{now margo runs forward.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{no. wait! let me talk to him first!}
<C>__{ippolito}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{kill that thing! kill it now!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{mbwun... turns and sees margo. she speaks desperately.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{john... you can give up now! just lie down where you are!}
<A>__{mbwun seems to consider for a moment, but then its eyes gleam and it roars. with renewed vigor it leaps to the wall and starts to walk up it like a gecko, on all fours! on the roof... some of the s.w.a.t. team fall back in terror! now that the monster is on the wall it's out of range of their fire!}
<C>__{waters}
<D>__{holy shit it's coming this way!}
<C>__{ippolito}
<D>__{it's headed for the roof. run!}
<A>__{ippolito turns and takes off once more in sheer terror. astonished, waters tries to regain control.}
<C>__{waters}
<D>__{get back here, you asshole! we can't let it get out!}
<P>__{(to the s.w.a.t. team)}
<D>__{surround the opening and kill it!}
<A>__{but the men are terrified, retreating like ippolito. waters shouts.}
<C>__{waters}
<D>__{back, everybody! that's an order!}
<A>__{but the team is in chaos and losing precious time.}
