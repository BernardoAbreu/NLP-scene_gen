<A>__{overhead: ali + foreman's corners are clear. ali is facing his corner, praying to allah. foreman is bent over at the waist, flexing and releasing the last tension in his huge shoulders, as the bell for round one clangs... the ring both charge out and stop as if they ran into a brick wall five feet from each other. then ali dips, throws a left, which george takes on the shoulder...a big right hand to george's head. the crowd goes nuts. george clinches, picks up ali and swings him through 180 degrees with his power. as he puts ali down, ali pushes george's head down and away and ali clocks him with another right. foreman clinches and drives ali back to the rope. ali throws another right that lands. ali dances, circles, stays out of foreman's way. then he slams him again with a right. foreman gets ali in the corner, throws vicious combinations and a hook that nails ali in the body and a wild shot hits ali on the side of the head. closer on ali...stunned, his eyes clear. he's just taken a foreman shot. he pushes foreman, the stronger man, out of the way and dances and circles. foreman ties him up again. ali pushes out, dances and hits him with a right. ali ties him up, and there's the}

<D>__{legs heavy...air's heavy...like sand...}

<A>__{as angelo and bundini's talk fades away. we see ali's awareness in a deep concentration. he is holding counsel with himself. ali stares into space across the diagonal to the other corner, but not really at foreman. ali is weighing something. a gamble. he blinks, and whatever it is, he's decided it now. ambient sound starts to come back as ali's attention returns to the present and he ignores...}

<B>__{the bell for round two}
<A>__{ali charges into the center of the ring, provoking foreman to chase him, and ali immediately backs to the rope. and stays there! seizing opportunity, foreman throws big hooks. ali is doing exactly what he's not supposed to do. he gets off the rope and backs to the rope on the other side. most of the shots are blocked by the gloves of both men. no damage. then george throws a left, which ali blocks, and a big right hook.}
<B>__{ali}
<A>__{turns away. nevertheless, it crashes into his jaw.}

<D>__{that all you got...? that it?}

<A>__{george's shots are taken on ali's elbows and gloves. but for every four that are thrown, one or two tremendous hooks get through to ali's ribs, his side. ali's face reveals impact, but nothing diminishes the terrible fortitude with which he endures. now, he ties up george. now, george drives ali into the corner and pummels him. angelo + bundini going crazy in the corner!}

<B>__{foreman hooks off his jab}
<A>__{ali leans back on the top rope. foreman's punch falls short and connects with little effect. that's how good is ali. the techniques become clear. foreman goes upstairs, throws three hooks, all get taken on ali's gloves. foreman slams a hook that began in cape town and ends up in zaire, into ali's abdomen. and another. ali takes the shots, hangs on. ali's eyes are bright like stars. his white mouth guard shines. a grimace? a grin?}

<A>__{ali pushes away from his handlers and rises. he opens his arms to the crowd. we hear a massive "ali, boma ye" start up. closer: ali opens his arms as if the roar of 65,000 voices is sunlight. by opening his arms, his skin soaks it in and converts it to power. and the bell starts round three.}
