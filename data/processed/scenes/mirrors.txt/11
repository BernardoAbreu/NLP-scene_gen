<C>__{larry}
<D>__{so did you find an apartment yet?}

<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i didn't know you had a sister. what does she do?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{she's a bartender.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{that's not too good for you! anyway, you know you are always welcome to stay at our house.}
<A>__{larry looks up at ben, slightly uneasy }
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{i ran into amy the other day. how are things going between the two of you?}
<A>__{ben remains silent. he obviously doesn't want to get into that subject.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{so, why did you want to see me ben?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you know what i want. i'm ready to come back, i'm feeling much better now.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{listen ben, i can't bring you back on the force. nobody in the squad wants you around right now. i'm sorry but i have to be honest with you. you understand, right?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{larry, i'm telling you, i'm ready.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{if it was up to me, i would bring you back tomorrow, but i'm not the only one who decides. listen, i think i've got something else for you. i know a guy at the mayflower corporation and they need someone to watch over one of their department stores.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what?! come on larry, a security guard job... i'm not ready to retire yet!}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{hey! i'm just trying to help here. i know you're over qualified for that position but it's a good opportunity for you for the time being...until the situation here quiets down. also the money is not that bad.}
<A>__{ben is having a hard time to contain his anger.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{you need the money, ben. you're in the middle of a divorce and you've got child support to cover. if you want to see your kids, you've got to get a job, any job.}
<A>__{deep inside, ben knows larry's right.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{do you know the mayflower on west 38th street?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i do. the one that burned down?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{yes, their night watchman hasn't shown up for work in several days. they need someone right away. take it, relax, and we will talk about your situation again in a couple months.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yeah, in a couple months... i gave everything for the nypd. i almost died out there. everyone seems to have forgotten that.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i didn't.}
