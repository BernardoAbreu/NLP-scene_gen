<A>__{blomkvist selects all 18 of the high angle parade photographs, transfers them to an iphoto file, and reopens them as a `slide show.' the first few, accompanied by the default music, minuet in g, dissolve at two second intervals. too long. too distracting with the music. and too wide. he adjusts the size function closer on harriet gets rid of the dissolve effect and music and reduces the time interval to make the transitions as quick as possible. he hits `play' again and watches a short jerky `silent film' a kind of electronic flip book: harriet arrives with her friends. moves along the street. stops and faces the parade. says something to her friends. laughs. watches the float with the harem girls on it. smiles. sees something to her left. turns her head slightly toward it. her eyes widen in fear. she looks down. she moves off. her friends look after her confused. and then she's gone. blomkvist backs up to the frame of harriet looking off with fear in her eyes, and for the first time believes without a doubt what vanger has believed for 40 years: she was murdered. whoever she saw across the street followed her and killed her. the cat watches him.}
