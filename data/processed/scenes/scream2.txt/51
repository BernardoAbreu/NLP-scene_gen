<L>__{interior campus theatre day}
<A>__{a large tiered theatre. seats five hundred. old but preserved and updated. a rehearsal is in progress. several actors stand stage center running lines as stagehands work on the set around them. sidney is one of them. she moves around the stage, very animated. more alive than ever. she dons a russian accent. convincing. a promising actress.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(in character)}
<D>__{"pain, yah, such pain. pain."}
<A>__{an awkward silence. everyone looks at each other. finally, lois, the bitchy sorority girl speaks up.}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{that's not the line. you jumped.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{shit. did i?}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{about a page.}
<C>__{director}
<P>__{(off stage)}
<D>__{cut! let's take five.}
<A>__{the actors break up as sidney, frustrated, walks across a make shift bridge that takes her across the orchestra pit and down the stairs into the house where hallie sits watching. sid's bodyguards can be seen sitting scattered about.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{that was good.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{yeah, right.}
<A>__{the director, mid 30's, intelligent, friendly.}
<C>__{director}

<A>__{sid nods in agreement. the director smiles at her.}
<C>__{director }

<A>__{she grabs her things and heads off with hallie when...}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{sid?}
<A>__{sid turns to find randy moving through an aisle. he had been watching rehearsal. sid's face tenses.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{who is that guy?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{it's okay. look, hallie, i will meet you outside.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{no, girletta, i don't leave your side.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i've got my entourage. take a break. please.}
<A>__{sid is definite. hallie backs off, heading up the aisle, against her better wishes.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sid, please. i never should have gone along with gale. i know i'm stupid. i wish i had some good reason to give you but i'm just stupid. please, sid, don't be mad at me.}
<C>__{sidney}

<C>__{randy}
<D>__{well, yeah... she gave me a job. freelance. it got me outta woodsboro. i'm sorry about cotton and yesterday. it was a bad idea. i knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. ah, shit, sid, i'm fucked up.}
<A>__{sidney looks at him long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{me, too. randy. me too.}
