<C>__{mckenzie}
<D>__{i mean... likes you, likes you. for real. tell her tom.}
<A>__{tom shuts the door on mckenzie as fast as he can. now it's just tom and summer. tom talks a mile a minute to try and erase mckenzie's last exchange from her mind.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{sorry you had to see that. happens every time we come here. it's unbelievable. something about that guy and singing for people. i don't know. but at least he didn't }
<C>__{summer}

<A>__{the wheels are spinning in tom's head. what's the right answer here?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yes. i mean... i haven't really thought about... yes. why?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{nothing. i just... you're interesting. i'd like us to be friends. is that ok?}
<A>__{tom was clearly hoping for her to say something else. he hides his disappointment the best he can.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{oh yeah totally. friends. you and me. that's... perfect.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{cool.}

<D>__{g'night summer.}
<A>__{tom watches her walk away for a beat before he turns to go the other way.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{friends. awesome. that's just great. well done hansen, you idiot.}
<A>__{tom walks a few more steps. and then, seemingly out of nowhere, without his even noticing, summer has wrapped her arms around him and pulled him into a kiss! it's unbelievable. there's a few seconds where tom isn't sure if he's dreaming or not. but then he realizes, suddenly, out of the blue, his best case scenario really is actually happening.
