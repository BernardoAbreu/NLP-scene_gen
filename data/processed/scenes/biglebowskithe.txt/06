<A>__{they both look up. quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of the lanes. over his polyester all in one he now wears a windbreaker with a racing stripe and "jesus" stitched on the breast. he is holding a fancy black and red leather ball satchel (perhaps a sylvia wein). behind him stands his partner, o'brien, a short fat irishman with tufted red hair.}
<C>__{quintana}

<D>__{you said it, man. nobody fucks with the jesus.}
<A>__{jesus walks away. walter nods sadly.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{eight year olds, dude.}
<A>__{dude's bungalow we are looking down at the dude who is prone on the rug. his eyes are closed. he wears a walkman headset. leaking tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an intermittent clatter. in his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled venice beach league playoffs 1987. the dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall rumbling down the lane. on its impact with the pins, the dude opens his eyes. he screams. a blonde woman looms over him. next to her a young man in paint spattered denims stoops and swings something towards the carrier. the sap catches the dude on the chin and sends his head thunking back onto the rug. a million stars explode against a field of black. we hear the "la la la la" of the man in me. the black field dissolves into the pattern of the rug. the rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of the city of los angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed. the dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his bowling shirt. he looks up. ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet. she is outpacing us, growing smaller. the dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand. his bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. he is falling. from a high angle we see the dude hurtling down toward the city, dragged by the ball. a reverse looking up shows the dude hurtling toward us out of the inky sky, his eyes wide with horror. led by the bowling ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in black. we hear a distant rumble, like thunder. dull reflections materialize in the darkness. they are glints off the shiny surface of an oncoming bowling ball. we pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being regurgitated up at us, overtaking us. the dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass rolling a huge shadow across his face. the gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward us finger holes. the largest thumb hole rolls directly over us, engulfing us once again in black.. the black rolls away and we are spinning spinning down a bowling lane our point of view that of someone trapped in the thumbhole of the rolling ball. we see the receding bowler spinning away. it is the blonde woman, performing her follow through. floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor; ceiling; approaching pins; again and again. we hit the pins and clatter into blackness. we hear pins spin, hit each other and drop. we hear an irritating, insistent beeping.}
