<L>__{interior pentagon conference room marco}
<A>__{is in a more formal setting lt. col. howard is with colonel garret and an enlisted soldier, a woman, taking notes }
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{i don't know, sir.}
<P>__{(cautious, now)}
<D>__{it isn't so much what he said, or didn't say but his demeanor, his attitude. sir, i overheard an exchange he }
<C>__{colonel garret}
<P>__{(talks over this)}
<D>__{i think you hoped congressman shaw would say, "yes, major, i've had those same dreams. tomatoes and sandstorms. you're not nuts, there's some crazy shit going down here."}
<A>__{marco says nothing.}
<C>__{colonel garret}
<D>__{major, we've been down this road with you before, yes?}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{no, sir, not this road, sir. but i hear what you're saying, and i want to do this through the proper channels.}
<C>__{lt. col. howard}
<D>__{are you back on your meds?}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{lt. colonel howard with respect i've had a dozen years of experts telling me i've got gulf war syndrome, or a stress disorder. twelve years being a good soldier, denying what every nerve ending in my body tells me is more real than not. one dream, over and over. not variations on a dream, the same one, night after night after night }
<C>__{lt. col. howard}
<D>__{ your guilt and your jealousy require you to construct this ... elaborate fiction, so that you }
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{lt. col. howard}
<D>__{ can avoid the truth.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{ no sir. something happened to us, in the desert, ten years ago. not what we thought it was. and it happened on my watch.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{colonel garret}
<D>__{have you contacted any other members of the unit besides shaw and melvin? asked them about the dreams?}
<C>__{marco}
<P>__{(from notes he's made)}
<D>__{owens died of cancer in '97. villalobos, a car crash. atkins committed suicide. jamison was at the pentagon, 9 11, body never recovered. wilson i'm still trying to track down.}
<A>__{garret and howard trade looks.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{sir, i know i can't ask you to talk to congressman shaw, not yet, but al melvin, it's a phone call, a quick q&a look at his notebooks, hear what he's been dreaming and either he will support the credibility of what i'm saying, or he won't. and i will shut up.}
<C>__{colonel garret}
<D>__{and what is it you are saying, exactly, major? that you misrepresented falsified what happened in kuwait? about the medal of honor? in effect, committed perjury.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{if you just talk to melvin }
<C>__{colonel garret}
<P>__{(ignores)}
<D>__{ no, no, i'm sorry you're saying an entire squad of u.s. army soldiers was hypnotized into believing that raymond shaw deserved the medal of honor. and somehow you're the only one who knows the truth.}
<A>__{silence. marco looks down at his hands.}
<C>__{colonel garret}
<D>__{major marco. you will stay clear of congressman shaw.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{lt. col. howard}
<D>__{and you will resume your meds, major. that is an order.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<A>__{beat. marco stands up, to leave, but }
<C>__{colonel garret}
<D>__{major, do you ever take a step back and consider why you've remained at rank for all these years? missed bosnia, afghanistan, iraqi freedom. while men of lesser promise and inferior talent have enjoyed the fruits of those campaigns and moved beyond you?}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{every day, sir.}
