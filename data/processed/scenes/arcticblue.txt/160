<A>__{the women sing along with the hymn. they face a shelf holding the pa, a rusty tv and record player. and, in front of the shelf, an unmanned pulpit.}
<L>__{exterior devil's cauldron}
<A>__{the men, including neff, split off from their mates and go into the maqi.}
<L>__{interior maqi}
<A>__{neff joins some other men sweating on benches in the primitive steam bath. kenai sits closest to the fire. his thick glasses are steamed up, but he finally looks warm.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{wilder's missing church services; you believe it?}
<C>__{kenai}
<D>__{i just as soon he stay gone. fool could've got us all killed, arresting ben corbett here in town.}
<L>__{exterior foothills above devil's cauldron day}
<A>__{exhausted, corbett and eric climb across the last set of foothills before the devil's cauldron valley. the town comes into view below them; faintly the music carries from below. corbett looks at eric and breaks the silence:}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{what makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{they think you're in fairbanks. if not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{don't bet on it.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i already have.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{you don't know how true that is.}
<A>__{eric sweeps the snow from between two rocks and sits down.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{we'll wait here until nightfall. no fire, no tarp.}
<A>__{corbett sits next to him. after a long moment:}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{didn't mean it, you being a coward. you're a lot of things, but chickenshit isn't one of them.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{maybe...maybe not. i will tell you what scares me stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk. that's why i want to work on the front lines, where what i do means something.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{soon as i got here, i realized my job was bullshit. oil company propaganda. i was ready to leave, then i thought screw it, i will outsmart them, do the work anyway.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't know anymore. maybe i am fooling myself. that's what i'm afraid of most of all.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{hell, i still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer i can go on. no 'home for retired trappers' that more }
<C>__{corbett }
<D>__{i ever saw. we're like eskimos get too old to be useful, we're left on the ice to die.}
<A>__{the men listen to the faint music echoing through the silent foothills.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing; softly)}
<D>__{my wife used to go to chapel on sundays. see her friends, 'cause i was away so much.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{should've been home that day. she'd be getting dressed right about now...}
<A>__{eric glances over as a look of utter desolation crosses corbett's face.}
