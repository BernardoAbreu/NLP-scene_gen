<L>__{interior vanger manor evening}
<A>__{vanger and martin all but ignore blomkvist as they chat with erika over dinner. they seem charmed by her.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{i apologize if you're having financial problems at the magazine in mikael's absence.}
<C>__{erika}
<D>__{we'll work through them.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<A>__{erika looks at blomkvist, but he hasn't talked to them about this.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{how long do you think you can hang on? six months or so?}
<C>__{erika}
<D>__{that sounds about right.}
<C>__{vanger}
<P>__{(cheerfully)}
<D>__{you know, i used to be in the newspaper business. we owned six dailies back in the 50's.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{we still own one. the courier, here in town.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{i let my nephew birger run it since he can't run anything else.}
<A>__{erika nods politely.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{so what do you say to taking on a partner?}
<C>__{erika}
<D>__{we've never considered it before. we value our independence.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{your independence is dependant on advertisers if we're being honest. however much you think that is, you'd retain. we don't care about content.}
<A>__{blomkvist suddenly feels like someone coming late to a party.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{excuse me. did i miss something?}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{we're talking about an investment in the magazine.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i gather. why would you want to do that?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{not for the return, that's for sure.}
<C>__{vanger}
<P>__{(to erika)}
<D>__{i feel bad that i've take mikael away from you at the worst possible time. this is the right thing to do. the moral thing. that's one reason.}
<C>__{erika}
<D>__{and.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{the enemies of my friends are my enemies. i hate wennerstrom as much as you hate what he's done to you.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{so what do you say?}
<A>__{erika half shrugs to say she'll consider it.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{is that a maybe?}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{wonderful! more wine, anna.}
<A>__{blomkvist looks at erika, but she glances away to vanger.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{i think mikael is adapting well to rustic life, by the way.}
<C>__{erika}
<D>__{have you seen him try to make a fire?}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{put the logs on end, like this.}
<A>__{he makes a teepee shape with his hands, like praying.}
