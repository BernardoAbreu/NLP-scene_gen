<A>__{evening. henry stalks along, all fired up. simon tries his best to keep up with him.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i've let myself down, simon! i've let myself be caught in the bloody maw of banal necessity! how did i get here? how did this happen to me? i'm going to be somebody's father! i need time to think. to write. time to finish my 'confession'! i can't work for a living! it's impossible! i tried once. my genius will be wasted trying to make ends meet!}
<A>__{he collapses extravagantly.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{this is how great men topple, simon. their hearts are in the right place too much of the time! they get sidetracked! distracted. oh! how could i have been so careless!}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{henry, please, let me read the 'confession'.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{no. not now. it's not done. i'm all washed up. i'm finished!}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{angus james is convinced my poem is going to make him incredibly wealthy. he'll read your book and seriously consider publishing it. if i ask him to. i'm certain.}

<C>__{henry}
<D>__{really? you really think so?}
<A>__{having finally got through to him, simon comes forward, anxious to help henry.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i will insist he publish the 'confession'.}

<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(adds)}
<D>__{or i won't let him publish my poem.}
<A>__{henry sits there watching simon, impressed with this evidence of increased self esteem. he realizes the profundity of the gesture.}

<D>__{you'd do that? you'd do that for me?}
<A>__{simon stares off into the distance.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{you saved my life.}
<A>__{henry is moved. he stands and comes forward. he grabs his friend by the shoulders and turns him around.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{do you realize what you're saying?}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(pausing)}
