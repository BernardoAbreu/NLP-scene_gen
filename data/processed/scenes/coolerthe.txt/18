<L>__{interior bernie's motel room night}
<A>__{bernie flips on the light. a dim overhead bulb hardly makes a dent in the gloomy surroundings. typical drab motel furnishings. we notice a couple of dead plants on the radiator next to the window. a single place setting on the counter. something odd: an empty cat food bowl on the kitchenette floor. no sign of a cat. go figure. bernie heads over to the dresser. a half filled bottle of gin rests next to a lone glass with a crack down the side. he pours himself a shot. turns on the tv. a religious channel. shitty reception.}
