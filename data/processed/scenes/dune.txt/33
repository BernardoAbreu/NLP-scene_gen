<L>__{25. back to scene}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{things have been so serious here lately.}
<C>__{gurney}
<D>__{yes. i sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. tomorrow we leave for arrakis! arrakis is real. the harkonnens are real.}
<A>__{thufir, yueh, gurney and paul stare at each other for a moment in silence. dr. yueh moves forward and begins to take paul's pulse rate and to collect other data with a small black machine.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{dr. yueh, do you have any information on the worms of arrakis?}
<A>__{ }
<C>__{dr. yueh}
<D>__{i have obtained a filmbook on a small specimen... only 125 meters long.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{only?!}
<A>__{they smile at each other.}
<C>__{dr. yueh}
<D>__{there are have been documented sightings of worms as large as 450 meters in the deep desert far from where we'll be in arakeen.... the desert belt and the south polar regions are marked forbidden.... why?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the storms and the worms. is it true, that the sand can blow at seven hundred kilometers per hour?}
<C>__{yueh}
<D>__{it can render flesh to dust in minutes. and these dry winds can generate tremendous static electricity in the atmosphere. our body shields won't have enough power to operate in the open air on arrakis.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, how do the fremen survive there?}
<C>__{yueh}
<D>__{we don't know much about the fremen... they live in the deep desert... some of them in the cities and they have blue within blue eyes...}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{the eyes yes, yes... saturation of the blood by the spice melange. could the spice affect us in other ways?}
<C>__{thufir}
<D>__{many dangers exist on arrakis. for one, we know the harkonnens would not have given up their choam company contract so easily.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{the harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, i suspect, is the emperor.}
<A>__{ }
<C>__{thufir}
<D>__{you will make a formidable duke!}
<A>__{paul bows.}
<C>__{thufir }
<D>__{now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i know. but if it is a trap then why are we going?}
<C>__{thufir}
<D>__{we have our new army.}
<P>__{(in the same breath)}
<D>__{dr. yueh, put the weirding module on him.}
<A>__{thufir, noticing a squad of guards at the other end of the training room, calls out to them.}
<C>__{thufir }
<D>__{clear and lock the room.}
<A>__{gurney activates a series of locks. lights glows above each doorway.}
<C>__{thufir }
<D>__{activate a fighter.}
