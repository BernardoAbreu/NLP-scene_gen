<B>__{close on lestat}
<A>__{smiling, revealing his fangs. reveal we are...}
<L>__{interior library talamasca inner council chamber night}
<A>__{lestat's face appears on a video screen in front of a room lined from floor to ceiling with leather bound books, ancient scrolls. subjects are marked, werewolves, poltergeists, possession... superimpose: secret order of the talamasca: center for}
<D>__{paranormal studies: london headquarters}
<A>__{jesse, making a presentation, stands before an impressive and imposing group of 10 talamascans, wearing demure suits. jesse is excited, a bit nervous, hoping to impress. she holds a remote which controls images appearing on the large video screen. clips from lestat's press conference continue. jesse gazes out at the talamascans.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i have reason to believe lestat's the real thing. a vampire. and an ancient one. talamascan #1 i don't know, jesse. it looks to me like the guy's got a good p.r. man with a flair for the theatrical.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(leans forward, eagerly)}
<D>__{it would appear that way. but have you listened to his songs? read his lyrics?}
<A>__{the talamascans glance at each other, surprised. shake their heads. a few laugh. they're not lestat's usual audience.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{well,i have. in one of his songs he refers to a pub called the sailor's arms. i think it's a clue...}
<A>__{she pushes a button, the lyrics appear on screen.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(reading screen)}
<D>__{'where are you now? back in the sailor's arms, somewhere in the back streets of soho?' i tracked down the old leases in london. it turns out, in the late 1700's, there was a pub right in the backstreets of soho called the sailor's arms.}
<A>__{the lyrics on screen are replaced now by an old engraving of a pub with the sign reading "sailor's arms."}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{and it had a reputation for dealing with black magic. witches' covens, seances, that sort of thing.}
<A>__{quick flashes of gruesome drawings appear animal sacrifices. a corpses floating above a table... jesse talks faster and faster with her enthusiasm.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{and most importantly, reports of people being lured there and subsequently attacked by bloodsucking fiends.}
<A>__{quick flashes of gruesome period newspaper drawings, blood pouring from the neck of a screaming woman. a white faced ghoul with fangs. jesse is smiling wider, excited by her discovery. on screen, an old map of london appears.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{here's where you could find the sailor's arms in old london.}
<A>__{a modern map appears, overlaying the old map.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{and here is where it would be today. of course the sailor's arms is not there anymore. that part of london is mostly old warehouses, meat packing plants. talamascan #2 in a few years it will be artists' lofts and pretentious french cafes...}
<A>__{jesse leans forward now as she talks.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{yes, but right now there's only one place to get a drink of sorts. a private club in exactly the same place. the waverly arms.}
<A>__{on screen, a photo of the waverly arms.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{well, what happens at the waverly arms now makes the sailor's arms look like a happy meal at mcdonald's.}
<A>__{she pauses for emphasis, gazing at the faces of the talamascans, gauging their reactions.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{it's a vampire coven. and lestat's leading us to it.}
<A>__{murmurs. many of definite interest. some of definite skepticism. jesse's face shines bright with her enthusiasm.}
<D>__{talamascan #1}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{and what makes you think so?}
<A>__{jesse smiles. pushes a button. ready to receive the talamascans' approval. on screen, a new picture appears of several figures, white faces, dark clothes but they're very blurry.}
<D>__{talamascan #2 jesse, can you, uh, focus that any better?}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(excitement dampened by embarrassment)}
<D>__{well... it was taken... while...}
<P>__{(clears throat)}
<D>__{... in motion.}
<A>__{talamascan #2 smiles at her sympathetically. jesse gazes out at the other talamascans, sees she's losing their interest.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(quickly, trying to cover)}
<D>__{but listen, if you look closely, you can see they're vampires. i'm sure of it. and lestat's leading us to them and talamascan #3}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{interesting. perhaps we should assign someone to observe talamascan #1 oh please, based on this so called 'data'? that's a waste of time.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{but... uh... talamascan #2}
<P>__{(looking up for a moment, interrupting)}
<D>__{wait a second. who took this picture?}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(a beat, softly)}
<D>__{i did.}
<A>__{murmurs bubble through the entire group now. they stare at jesse, dismayed.}
<D>__{talamascan #2 you went there?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{yes. last night. talamascan #1 and who gave you this directive?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{no one. i... just... went.}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{look, i know it was breaking protocol and i'm really sorry, it's just i think talamascan #1 jesse! you're just an apprentice here! you must follow our rules... or perhaps we need to reconsider your position.}
<A>__{she stares at him.}
<D>__{talamascan #3 for 12 centuries our mission as talamascans has been to observe and record paranormal behavior. but never get involved. you're getting far too close.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(gesturing to photo, defending herself)}
<D>__{hey, does it look like i got involved? that is not called involvement. that is called running. talamascan #2}
<P>__{(leaning forward, trying to help)}
<D>__{but, jesse, tell us, what did you see?}
<A>__{jesse turns to her.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{vampires. gathering. i'm sure of it.}
<A>__{jesse steps from the podium, moving through the talamascans as she pleads her case. she talks a mile a minute, her passion rising...}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{you have to listen to lestat's lyrics. they're amazing.}
<C>__{jesse }
<D>__{many of the references could only be derived from years of research in the bibliotech de paris, which seems unlikely for a young rock star in his early twenties. plus there are historical details dating back hundreds of years lestat describes that don't exist anywhere... except in our library. he refers to marius, the great white lord, who ruled over a group of islands off the bay of naples in the late 18th century. what i'm trying to say here, and maybe i'm not doing the best job of it, is that lestat may be the oldest and most powerful vampire ever documented!}
<A>__{jesse sees some of the talamascans are again listening. but talamascan #1 shakes his head...}
<D>__{talamascan #1 it doesn't make any sense. why would he be forecasting this to the world? he's all but drawn a map and marked an x. what vampires hold sacred is keeping their kind a secret. you never name other immortals, tell where their lairs are. they'd be hunted down.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{right. that's the best part. lestat's not afraid to piss them off. he wants mortals and immortals to know he's there, to know he exists. i don't know why...}
<P>__{(glancing at skeptical talamascan #1)}
<D>__{but this has never happened before. don't you see? he's a one man revolution.}
<A>__{all the talamascans gaze at her a moment. jesse holds her breath. has she gotten them back?}
<D>__{talamascan #1 and this photo is your evidence? it's hardly conclusive.}
<P>__{(snorts)}
<D>__{c'mon. it looks like the blair witch!}
<A>__{the talamascans burst out laughing, even talamascan #2. jesse gazes at them, her face burning red. she's lost them, blown it. made a fool of herself. her frustration rises, she can no longer contain it. it bursts out of her.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{fine. well then, i guess i will just have to go back and get better, more conclusive evidence! maybe you just can't unravel all the mysteries of the world out there, by sitting around all day in a dusty old library in here!}
<A>__{as they gaze at her, astonished, she gathers her materials, starts out. several start shouting back at her. amidst the uproar, a voice booms across the room.}
<C>__{talbot }
<D>__{jesse.}
<A>__{everyone turns. quiets down. david talbot stands in the back of the room. he's clearly the superior talamascan, though younger than some, very charismatic.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{my office. now.}
<A>__{he turns, walks out. all the talamascans look at jesse. it doesn't look good. her face burning red, jesse turns, leaves.}
