<A>__{in the darkness, we hear the solitary sound of a heartbeat, resounding like a drum.}
<C>__{narrator }
<D>__{in between the years when the oceans drank atlantis and the rise of the sons of aryas, there was an age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world like blue mantles under the stars. hither came conan, the cimmerian: a thief, a slayer, a king born of battle.}
<A>__{muffled sounds, as if underwater, echo: clanging swords, the guttural cries of combat.}
<B>__{unborn baby}
<A>__{eyes closed, floating at peace within red glow of the womb. suddenly, a flash of steel, as a sword pierces the womb, its tip not an inch from the baby's head. as the sword is ripped out, light streams in from outside, we travel with it, into the din of battle.}
