<A>__{he releases roach's arm and the star disintegrates, drifting apart. bodhi stays with utah, falling parallel to the horizon, facing each other, holding hands. 4000 feet. airspeed grommet pulls his ripcord. he seems to be jerked upward by a great force. suddenly he is far above, a brightly colored disc of fabric. utah is suddenly aware of the earth rushing up at him. nathaniel pulls, then roach. they shoot upward, disappearing. bodhi and utah fall on, alone.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{you gonna pull?}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{after you, alfonse. i insist!}
<A>__{bodhi looks at utah. a slow grin. the meter on his chest harness reads 2000 ft. 150 mph. 12 seconds to valhalla.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{don't screw around man, pull it!}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{you do it... you first!}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{one thousand feet. pull the goddamn cord!}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{you first!}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{okay!}
<A>__{bodhi reaches out suddenly and pulls utah's ripcord handle. he waves goodbye as johnny's canopy deploys. utah is jerked upward. he feels his weight hanging brutally in the harness. johnny looks down. impossibly close to the ground. bodhi's canopy bursts out, an explosion of color. below him is the shimmering mirror of a large reservoir. two seconds later the bright yellow canopy meets its reflection and goes slack. an explosion of white water marks bodhi's impact. low angle at water level as utah hits. in slow motion a glorious wall of backlit spray shouts skyward. molten glass falling back in the bright desert dawn. utah surfaces, sputtering, and shucks out of the harness. he floats like a jellyfish, gasping for breath.}
