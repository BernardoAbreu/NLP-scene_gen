<L>__{interior tunnel night}
<A>__{pancake is on his stomach, wearing goggles, boring a hole into a rock face with a power drill.}
<L>__{interior munson house cellar night}
<A>__{we hear the whine of the drill faintly here, all but covered by the sound of the chamber music on the boom box. the other men sit around. dorr gives a casual glance at his watch as the whine subsides. pancake emerges from the tunnel covered with grime.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{the drill bit's getting awfully hot. gawain, maybe you could fill a hudson sprayer and spritz it down while i drill.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{fuck you, man, i ain't your house nigger. i'm the inside man!}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{look, are you gonna have a bug up your ass for the rest of the time we work together?}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{i will get the sprayer.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{no no, me and this gentleman here have to get square. let me tell you something, macsam. you wanna know something?}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{i don't wanna know shit from you.}
<A>__{pancake leans against the wall and pushes his goggles up on his forehead, leaving raccoon eyes.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{i'm gonna tell you how i came down to mississippi. wasn't born here, you know. i'm from scranton, pennsylvania...}
<A>__{abruptly, he stares off into space.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{...nnnff!}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{pancake's eyes regain their focus:}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{...scranton, pennsylvania. came down here in 1964. greyhound bus. with the freedom riders. you know who the freedom riders were, macsam?}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{i don't give a shit who they were. just tell me when they gonna leave.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{the freedom riders, my fine young man, were a group of concerned liberals from up north whites, negros, and yes, jewish people all working together, just like we are here. concerned citizens who came down here so that local black people could have their civil liberties. so that people like you could have the vote.}
<A>__{all look at pancake. quiet, except for the delicate chamber music. gawain's tone softens:}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{...you know what, man?}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{what, brother?}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{i don't vote. so fuck you.}
<A>__{pancake darkens:}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{why you fucking }
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{and the bus you rode in on!}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{that's it!}
<A>__{he peels off his coat.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{...let's step outside, macsam!}
<A>__{there is a knock on the cellar door. the men freeze momentarily, then scramble for their instruments. the general flips his cigarette backwards into his mouth. dorr turns off the boom box, then calls:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{yes, madam?}
<A>__{the door opens and mrs. munson comes down the stairs, holding a large plate covered by a checked napkin.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{my friend mrs. funthes is here so i'm about to go on out. i just wanted to leave y'all with some cinnamon cookies...}
<A>__{she takes the napkin off and carries the plate from person to person; each obediently takes a cookie with a murmured "thank you, ma'am."}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{...y'all sound pretty good. it'd be nice if you'd come by the church some day, give us a recital.}
<A>__{dorr takes her by the arm and escorts her back to the stairs.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{oh madam, you are too kind. our music, however, is how shall i put it? rather roman in its outlook; many of our pieces were commissioned by the holy see.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{oh, i see all right, but we don't make a big whoop dee do about denominations; everybody welcome at our church. we've had methodists come in. episcopals. even had a jew come in once with a guitar back in the sixties.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{indeed. excuse me, one moment, ma'am, and i shall see you off...}
<A>__{they have reached the top of the stairs and the professor ushers her out but stays behind himself. he turns to address the rest of the men below:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...if you gentlemen can labor harmoniously in the course of my absence, then perhaps upon my return we shall be prepared to explode that vexin' ol' piece a igneous.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{he's the motherfuckin' piece of igneous.}
