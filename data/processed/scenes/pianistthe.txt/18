<A>__{hands on the piano keyboard. podgy, hairy hands with dirty nails. they play an octave, harsh, toneless, with straight fingers. the hands belong to mr lipa, a dealer, early fifties. he sits at the piano, now examining the lacquer. regina stands in the bow, watching him. henryk is at the table, also watching intently. szpilman sits apart, aloof, his back to the piano and to mr lipa.}
<C>__{mr lipa}
<D>__{that's the price. that's what i'm offering. and my advice is to accept. you won't get more from anyone else.}

<C>__{mr lipa}
<D>__{two thousand. my advice is to take it. what you going to do when you're hungry? eat the piano?}
<A>__{henryk suddenly makes a lunge for him, grabs hold of him, a rough struggle takes place and during it mother and father appear at their bedroom door to watch, appalled.}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{get out! you're a thieving bastard, we don't want your money, get out! we'd rather give it away! get out!}
<A>__{regina tries physically to restrain him.}

<D>__{his breath,}
<P>__{overlapping)}
<D>__{you people are crazy! i'm doing you a favour, two thousand, and i'm paying for the removal, i'm not even charging for the removal.}
<A>__{henryk subsides, glowering at him.}
<C>__{mr lipa}
