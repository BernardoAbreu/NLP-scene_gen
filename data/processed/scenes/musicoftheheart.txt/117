<L>__{interior cpe 1 auditorium the concert stage night}
<A>__{seventy five kids play "we shall overcome" and it's incredibly moving. nick's on cello, lexi plays piano. roberta proudly leads the children. at the side of the stage, we see dorothea photographing the concert. the camera pans the audience of teary eyed parents, many of them with cam corders. we find ramon's family. manuelo is riverted by his son's playing, and he starts to cry. concepcion knows this without looking. she takes his hand. angle janet stands along the side and her eyes start to fill with tears. she tries to stay composed, then discreetly exits the auditorium. the song ends and the audience applauds, rising from their seats, including assunta (now 65), next to isabel and dan. someone remains seated: a reporter (40's), sitting beside dan and taking notes. the students bow, then point to roberta who bows and takes the stage. she gestures for people to sit. a beginner student brings her flowers. roberta kisses her, then approaches the mike.}

<D>__{the beautiful concert that you just heard could be the last concert of the east harlem violin program. the board of education and the district superintendent don't think that music is important for our children. but they're wrong and they're in for a fight.}
<A>__{the parents stand and applaud. we see the reporter writing quickly. dorothea snaps more pictures. roberta extends an arm towards the kids, directing the applause at them. ramon gives her a thumbs up.}
