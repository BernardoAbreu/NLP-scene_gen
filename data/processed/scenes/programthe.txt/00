<D>__{allright, bowl bid ridin' here for e.s.u. fourth down on the georgia tech 18. 4 ticks left. kane sets 'em down.}
<T>__{instant cut to:}
<A>__{line of taped knuckles night smashing into the mud, as a football offensive line comes set, frosted breath steaming across to: the defensive line digging in, ready to explode.}
<B>__{close on joe kane}
<A>__{e.s.u. quarterback, barking signals. the ball is snapped, and we go to slow motion as the lines crash together in the slop. joe rolls to the right, looking downfield. a huge defensive end bears down on him. joe jukes. the end whips on by, grabbing for jersey, slipping off. but big number 75 is closing the gap. on the run, joe releases a desperation pass toward the end zone, just as 75 catches him and buries him face down in the swamp. we follow the ball, spiraling through the slanting rain. ray griffen, black running back, glances back for it, two defensive backs with him. all three leap in unison, climbing as high as they can, clutching, clawing for the ball. the ball floats down, kisses off the tangle of fingers, splashes to the ground, and rolls to a stop in the mud. incomplete. the bang of the final gun snaps us back to live action. joe on his knees in the muck, stares at the goal line, then drops his head in defeat.}
<B>__{angle on sam winters}
<A>__{betraying little emotion, coach sam winters, wiry, intense, early 50's, takes off his headset, lets it drop, heads across the field.}
<P>__{reporter #1 (v.o.)}
<D>__{coach, this is the second year in a row you've failed to go to a bowl game. do you feel your program's in decline?}
