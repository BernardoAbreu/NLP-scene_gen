<L>__{exterior elm street nancy's home. night.}
<A>__{high angle at the second floor level. nancy jerks open the window to her mother's bedroom and jams her face to the bars. the ambulance is pulling away with a tremendous wail of its siren as nancy screams down, trying to make herself heard.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{help! hey daddy i got him trapped! where are you!?}
<A>__{angle on the street. parker, assigned to guard the house, sees nancy hair white, eyes wide pounding on the bars and screaming like a lunatic. but her meaning is utterly lost in the noise of the ambulance next to him.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(yelling up at her)}
<D>__{everything's going to be all right! everything's under control!}
<A>__{angle at the window. close on nancy's face, incredulous at his response.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{get my father, you asshole!}
<A>__{parker does a little take. that almost sounded sane.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{you heard what i said! now get back inside or i will tell your dad!}
<A>__{behind her the door splinters. nancy whirls around just in time to see krueger bull in! nancy's eyes go wide she's trapped against the bars and has nowhere to go. the man bunches his knives into a single thick blade and rushes her, stabbing. nancy closes her eyes then from out of frame marge leaps between the two.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she blocks the charge perfectly blocking the knives. both she and nancy are slammed backwards against the bars behind. drunk though she is, is hanging onto krueger's weapon hand, keeping the knives inside herself, away from her daughter!}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{nancy for god's sake's run!}
<A>__{but nancy turns to the window instead, screaming for her father.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{daddy! where are you!}
