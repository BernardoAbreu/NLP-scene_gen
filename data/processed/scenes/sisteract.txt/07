<A>__{poster night (today) taped over a crack on a wall. the poster shows a glittering christy van cartier: singing star of a fifth rate vegas lounge. christy wears tight spangles and a major wig on the poster. she has clearly lived up, or down, to all of sister immaculata's expectations. the camera pans through the dark bedroom in which the poster hangs; a neon sign flashes outside the window, casting a red and blue haze over the premises. a dressing room table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail polish and makeup, and garish clothing and flashy jewelry are scattered everywhere. we hear the movement of bed springs as someone sits up in the dark.}

<P>__{(looking deep into her eyes)}
<D>__{he said that if i got a divorce i'd burn in hell. for all eternity.}

<P>__{(trying to calm her)}
<D>__{we can still see each other. just like always. it's a different kind of sin. smaller.}

<D>__{i will call.}
<A>__{vince kisses two fingers, and blows the kiss to christy. he leaves. christy is left standing on the bed, holding a particularly garish stuffed animal she was about to hurl. with vince gone she slumps to the bed, cradling the stuffed animal. she is caught between tears and rage.}
