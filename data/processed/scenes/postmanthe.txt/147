<A>__{the postman poised on a rise that affords a view of the gruesome spectacle below. postman's pov pine view in flames. the big john deere gun has blown several gaps into the palisade. bethlehem watches as his army sacks the town. the people have been rounded up. the selection of the ten has begun.}

<C>__{ford}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{they'll kill you.}
<A>__{the postman starts to ride through them. luke, chubby and ponytail move their horses to block. ford maneuvers his horse in close and grabs the postman's harness.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{goddamnit }
<A>__{the postman jumps off his horse. ford tackles him. the postman shoves him away, continues on. luke and chubby pounce on him. with ford's help, they hold him down.}

<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{there's still time, ford!}

<D>__{because bethlehem has to know that we're not going to stop.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{god damn you, ford. those people down there are dying because of us. because of what we did.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{bullshit. they're dying because of bethlehem. they're dying because this is a shitty world. and if we're ever going to change it, then somebody might have to die. if i could make it be me down there i would. but i can't.}
