<L>__{interior courthouse hallway jacksonville 1990 day}
<A>__{packed. nuts. standing room only. the courtroom buzzes as george is led down the center aisle and is handed off to the bailiff. over this we hear...}
<C>__{clerk}

<D>__{yes, i do.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{do you see him here in the courtroom?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{let the record state the witness has identified, diego delgado.}
<A>__{the following sound bytes are dissolved together in montage style...}
<C>__{prosecutor }
<D>__{mr. jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with mr. delgado?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{shortly after i arrived at danbury federal correctional institute i related to diego that the crime i was in for was smuggling marijuana. diego told me he had high level connections in colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into america...}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{the first run was fifteen kilos, which we smuggled into logan airport in hard shelled suitcases.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{we wrapped the cocaine in kitchen cabinet paper, and duct tape, that way if there were any dogs in customs...}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{i introduced diego to a pilot named jack stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of cocaine per week into the united states via twin engine cessnas. jack would fly into north carolina, we'd meet him there and drive it down to different distribution points...}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{i never met pablo escobar. diego delgado was my only connection to cocaine from colombia...}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{diego convinced me to keep most of my money in a panamanian bank. diego had a close relationship with manuel noriega. in exchange for allowing us to keep our money there, we paid him a percentage.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{there was an 85% chance that if you snorted cocaine between 1977 1984, it was ours. initially with my la connections, we invented the marketplace. in 1977, there was no other real competition.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{the first year we made about 100 million dollars between us. it was an expensive operation. eventually we built up to three different pilots doing multiple runs per week, connections on both coasts, everything was running smooth. we were like a corporation...}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{he was very anti government. he talked about revolution, forming his own country or island, he was looking for power as well as money. i was just looking for money.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{he disliked the united states, thought it was a police state. he hoped that by flooding the country with cocaine, it would disrupt the political system and tear down the morality of the country.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{well, yes, derek foreal was my connection, i met him back in 1968 when i first moved to manhattan beach. it was foreal's marijuana connections that kicked off our cocaine market.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos to los angeles. when diego finally got derek foreal's name from me, it was only a matter of months before he'd cut me out.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{i'm not sure how my relationship with my daughter and ex wife have anything to do with this trial. i mean we're here to talk about diego delgado, aren't we?}
<C>__{calibanos}
<D>__{yes, we are mr. jung.}
<A>__{we come out of the montage, the defense attorney diego delgado, joe calibanos, a sleazy greek like ex basketball weight lifter guy is now doing the questioning.}
<C>__{calibanos }
<D>__{mr. jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes, i am.}
<C>__{calibanos}
<D>__{do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the united states government in regards to your testimony?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no, i cam here out of my own volition.}
<C>__{calibanos}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{something about vengance being best served cold.}
<C>__{calibanos}
<D>__{really. are you getting paid, mr. jung?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{calibanos}
<D>__{mr. jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the united states government in connection with your testimony in this case?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'm doing sixty years at otisville, no chance of parole. even if they cut my sentence in half i will be seventy three years old. that's some fucking deal. i don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or jesus christ himself can get me out of here. i have a really bad record, i'm not sure what's going to happen.}
<C>__{calibanos}
<D>__{so you do have an agreement with the united states government, mr. jung, correct?}
<A>__{george can't respond. looks to diego. looks from the jury, the judge, george is on the spotlight and it's uncomfortable. he feels suddenly sleazy.}
<C>__{calibanos }
<D>__{i thought so. no more questions.}
<A>__{silence. the judge tells george he can step down. calibanos laughs quietly with associates. george is bummed. he walks by diego. they look at each other.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you shouldn't have taken the 30 million, diego, i was out.}
<A>__{george is lead away.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{the court calls mr. jack stevens.}
<A>__{jack stevens is lead to the stand. we slowly dissolve to:}
