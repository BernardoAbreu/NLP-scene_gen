<L>__{exterior river, en route to salisbury. day}
<A>__{inman stands in the river, hoping to catch a fish, trying to concentrate. veasey presides, complaining...}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{used to be as regular as morning prayers. matter of fact i could set my watch by my bowels. that beeswax you fed me, day before yesterday, it stops a man up. open my gut now they'd find turds stacked up like little black twigs.}
<A>__{on a parallel track across the river, riders... impossible to say whether home guard or a federal raiding party. inman splashes out of the water, pushes veasey down, silencing him. the riders pass. veasey spots something shining in the grass, picks it up. it's a long two handed saw.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{hey! look at this!}
<P>__{(flexing it)}
<D>__{this is a good saw.}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{it's not yours. you take it, you make us another enemy. you're a christian don' t you know your commandments?}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{you'll find the good lord very flexible on the subject of property. we could do a lot with this saw...}
<A>__{inman is vexed, walks away. veasey follows, experimenting with the saw's music when flexed. inman stalks on.}
