<A>__{conan pulls off his jerkin, revealing a torso rippling with muscles.}

<D>__{we'll rest here until morning.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{will i awake alone? do you intend to leave me?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{i would do you a kindness. khor kalba will bring only death.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{please, conan. artus told me of how you lost your tribe. i too had to watch as my people were taken from me.}
<A>__{conan ignores her, gathering wood for a fire.}
<C>__{tamara }
<D>__{all i ask is that you let me travel with you. i too have a purpose. i must get to the queen. i would rather you kill me here, than fail her again.}
<A>__{conan continues collecting, infuriating tamara.}
<C>__{tamara }
<D>__{i was wrong about you. you are no fearless warrior. your heart is closed to all but fear and hate.}
<A>__{conan draws flint, starting the fire. only once his task is complete does he answer tamara.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{we leave at dawn. i will not break stride for you. not once. i will get you into khor kalba. beyond that i have my purpose, and you yours.}
<A>__{tamara offers a thankful nod, her anger subsiding.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{nice fire. does it mean you'll actually cook the meat this time?}
