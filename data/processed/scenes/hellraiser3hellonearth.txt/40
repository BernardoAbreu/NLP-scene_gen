<D>__{i don't know what the box is. but i know what it does. i ... (looks up to side) i've said all this before. do you ... (blinks, nods, as if listening. looks back to camera) i saw it open. i opened it. i saw what came out. i don't know what else to call them. demons. demons live in the box. or come through the box from somewhere else. it's a gateway to hell. or the south bronx. (smiles ruefully at her own joke. looks up to side as if chastised for kidding around. nods. continues) i know you don't believe me. i know what it sounds like. but what else ... jesus, talk to ronson, talk to the other cops. they saw the house. they saw my ... my father ...}

(pause. long drag on the cigarette?) maybe not this reality ... but there are others. i've seen them.}
<A>__{joey's face shows horrified fascination at kirsty's story. there is a conviction in the telling which is working on joey.}
