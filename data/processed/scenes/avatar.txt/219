<T>__{time cut :}
<A>__{ mo'at stands in a kind of trance amongst the tendrils of the mother tree. neytiri and the other acolytes dance hypnotically. all the omaticaya sway and chant to the rhythm of the drums. macro shot fine, hairlike threads have emerged from the roots and are gently spreading over grace's human skin. jake, still holding her hand, watches her body being fused to the root floor by a thousand connections. grace's avatar is gently connected by the same questing root cilia they entwine with the queue and spread over the body. the grotto is dark except for the spectral glow of the willows. the chant continues, hypnotically. mo'at, on her knees beneath the mother tree, writhes her arms in the trance state. her eyes are rolled back, showing only white. grace gasps and her eyes snap open. her expression is amazed, as if seeing something so beautiful it can never be explained. on her hand gripping jake's convulsively, as she tries to anchor herself to this world for a few more seconds }
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i'm with her jake }
<P>__{(an amazed whisper)}
<D>__{ she's real }
<A>__{grace shudders, as pain shoots through her. blood seeps through the silken white root cilia growing across her abdomen. drowning white in shocking crimson. she exhales a last shuddering breath and goes still.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{grace!}
<A>__{he sees the roots falling away from her human body. jake turns hopefully toward her avatar but the roots are falling away from it as well. it sleeps vacant. mo'at stops the chant. she crosses to jake and kneels with him, touching his shoulder.}
<C>__{mo'at}
<D>__{her wounds were too great, there was not enough time. she is with eywa now.}
<A>__{neytiri removes grace's mask and gently closes her eyes. jake stands slowly, barely holding it together. neytiri comes to him and he sees the despair and hope conflicting on her face and he raises his head. turns to face tsu'tey and the}
<B>__{crowd.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{with your permission, i will speak now. you would honor me by translating.}
<A>__{tsu'tey gestures assent, and they face the clan together. jake speaks, the pain of grace's death in the passion and fury of his voice. tsu'tey translates beside him.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{the sky people have sent a message that they can take whatever they want, and no one can stop them. but we will send them a message. ride out, as fast as the wind can carry you, tell the other clans to come. tell them toruk macto calls to them. fly now with me brothers and sisters! fly! and we will show the sky people that this is our land!}
<A>__{tsu'tey finishes with a bloodcurdling war cry, and the entire clan responds, their shouts echoing across the forest. jake takes neytiri's hand and runs to the leonopteryx. he vaults onto its back and pulls her up behind him. the hunters run to their banshees, mounting quickly. jake's leonopteryx rises on mighty wings into the night sky. with a thunder of wings, the banshees take off after it. long lens polyphemus. across its face, the banshees rise like a swarm of bats. groups of riders peel off in different directions.}
