<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{oh, god.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{he is so bald.}
<A>__{seated a few rows behind the girls are pike and benny. the are fairly punked out, (and not currently attending high school). pike is long and lean, has short hair spiked and a taste for long coats and black. benny is somewhat stockier, opts for a shaved head and suspenders. doc martins for both. benny is clearly the more belligerent of the two when pike speaks, it's with surprising wit and reserve. sometimes.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{will you guys shut up, please?}
<C>__{buffy}

<C>__{benny}
<D>__{oh, yeah. but i still want to know what happens.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{everyone get horribly killed except the blonde girl in the nightie, who finally kills the monster with a machete but it's not really dead.}
<A>__{the boys stare at her.}
<C>__{jennifer}
