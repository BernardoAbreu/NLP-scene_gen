<L>__{interior n.t.i. structure}
<A>__{bud stares around in awe as smooth, pearlescent walls blur past him. it is a curving three dimensional maze of tunnels, like a vast circulatory system, where controlled currents of water become freeways in three dimensional space. tunnels divide, narrow, and reenter main routes hundreds of feet across, as the pair race through in a dizzying blur.}
<L>__{interior final chamber}
<A>__{entering a smaller chamber they settle to the floor, and the nti moves back a few feet. a shimmering plane or surface appears like a vertical curtain bisecting the chamber. the seawater divides, like the red sea, into two rippling walls. they move apart. leaving bud standing in a short, shimmering hallway. weakly, he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free. drops to his knees. doubles over as spasms wrack him. breathing fluid explodes from his lungs. he lies gasping and coughing on the floor, dragging in deep breaths of what he can only hope is air. it is. bud slowly recovers, sitting up. his head is clearing. this really is happening. beyond the shimmering, vertical surface of the water he sees the nti being joined by others, move or less identical, until a group of seven is gathered watching him.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{howdy, uuuh... how you guys doin'?}
<A>__{his voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber. soft laps of water from the 'walls'. in the air a pattern of glowing lines appears, a series of what appears to be circuit diagrams. bud staggers back from this strange 'screen' hanging in mid air. the image is about twenty feet across. there is a rolling jumble of static and interference which resolves into... the face of dan rather, doing the evening news. static, then another newscast. and another. fragments of the same story. the world on the brink of war.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you watch out tv? that what you're trying to say? that you know what's been going on up there?}
<A>__{the ntis are impassive. static... then another newscast. this time, we're allowed to focus on the story. an on the scene interview outside a high tech seismology lab. there is an air of hysteria about the scene... technicians running across the background of the shot, people shouting, the reporter jamming his mike at the harried looking scientist.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{... a caltech scientist who is among those reporting an unprecedented disturbance in the world's oceans. dr. breg, can you give us a clearer explanation then we're getting?}
<A>__{berg is edgy and distracted. people keeps handing him pieces of paper, computer hardcopy. the biggest thing in his life is happening...}
<C>__{berg}
<D>__{they're acoustic shockwaves, like tsunamis, but with no seismological source. the waves are propagating toward the shorelines of every continent }
<A>__{an assistant runs up, face shiny with fear, beckoning. we see that berg is running scared. the impossible bringing the greatest terror to the rational mind.}
<C>__{berg}
<D>__{yeah. i will be right there... i have to go. look, we don't know what it is! okay? not the slightest goddamn idea!}
<A>__{the image dissolves into static, fades out. bud turns to the ntis.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you're doing it! right? that's what you're telling me. yeah, you can control water... that's your technology. but why?}
<A>__{static again, then a brilliant flash. grainy stock film of a hydrogen bomb test in the pacific. the film repeats, and then again, faster, and again until is merges into an unbroken white glare. bud gets the message.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{hey, you don't know they're really gonna do it. where do you get off passing judgment on us, when you can't be sure? how do you know?}
<A>__{the screen exploded into a staccato series of searing images, stark moments from recent history... us soldiers fighting in vietnam, street warfare in beirut, a car bomb in belfast, a suspect shot in the head in the streets of saigon, burned and bleeding children, grainy footage of corpses bulldozed into mass graves at auschwitz, wermacht soldiers marching in goose step review, a 13 year old contra with an ak 47... just glimpses, strobing... a few frames of each. but enough. the images continue. hold on bud, as the lights flicker on his face, the ongoing indictment of humanity.}
