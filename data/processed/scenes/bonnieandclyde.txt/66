<A>__{they kiss. they are near the bed on which are some guns that clyde has been cleaning. the kiss moves toward real love making. they are on the bed and push the guns aside. some fall to the floor. clyde breaks the embrace after it has reached a high pitch. he moves away from the bed toward the window. bonnie follows him and embraces him from the rear. they are miserable. bonnie frees him and returns to the bed. she falls on it face down. a gun presses into her face. clyde sits in the window, the light silhouettes him. he turns his face toward the glass and rests his head on the window pane. bonnie turns to him from bed. she smiles a comforting smile at him. she rolls over onto her back. the gun is now under her head and moves it. she sits up and gestures to clyde. he remains at the window. she stares at him. she looks toward the bathroom. she looks back at clyde. she is moved and pained for him. she touches her cheek with the gun and waits for him to be able to look at her. finally he does. her look eases him and he almost smiles.}
