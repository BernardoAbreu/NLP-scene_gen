<T>__{dissolve to :}
<L>__{102 full shot the p.b.r.}
<A>__{it zig zags away from us down the river at high speed.}
<T>__{dissolve to :}
<L>__{103 full shot the trees, boat, crew night}
<A>__{the boat is hidden under some trees along the river bank. the men wait tensely listening }
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{you hear it again?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{no i don't think so. but it'll be back. they were circling. it'll be back.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{you think he'd of shot us?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{any time us americans.}
<A>__{lance looks over at willard.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{i don't think he d of shot us on the beach but he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board }
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{a yater spoon is hard to get especially here.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{he's a man who knows what he wants he does know what he wants.}
<C>__{chef}
<D>__{can i go get those mangos now?}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{i will go with you in a while judt hold tight awhile }
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{captain that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{and you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{it's a feeling you get in the jungle. when you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.}
<C>__{clean}
<D>__{how can you tell their weapons.. an' how far they're going?}
<A>__{willard smiles.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{mostly from the imprints when they put them down to rest. their morale from the way they drag their feet, or the joints that may be lying around. if they're near a base camp, they wouldn't be conserving food; they'll be throwing it away half eaten. if the branches aren't broken, their weapons are slung. but all this is just technique.. there's a feeling you get after a while, that's what's important. i was going through a village once. i was looking for a certain party. i took off my boots, and walked into each hut. it was midnight. i went into three like that and suddenly i realized i d gone into each hut the same way standing up so the next one i went in on my belly. an rpd burst took out the door a bit above my head.}
<P>__{(he shrugs)}
<D>__{things like that.}
<A>__{a pause, and then suddenly his attention is diverted they all are silent it is pitch dark we hear the distant sound of rotor blades and indistinguishable language on a loudspeaker the talk stops the rotors grow louder until almost overhead.}
<C>__{kilgore }
<P>__{(over a loudspeaker)}
<D>__{i'm not gonna hurt or harm you, boy i just want the board back you can understand it was one of my best you know how hard it is to get a board you like, boy. i'm not gonna hurt or harm you just leave it where i can find it }
<A>__{the helicopter drones on into the night the same speech starts again further off finally the noise ceases.}
<C>__{clean}
<D>__{jesus that guy's too damn much.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{i wonder if that was the same copter.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{he's probably got 'em all over the river with that recording. we better move now while it's dark.}
<A>__{chef steps forward with a plastic basket.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{yeah, chef go ahead take lance with you }
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{i will go with him }
<A>__{they all look at him.}
<C>__{willard}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i wanta get my feet on solid land once in awhile }
<A>__{he grabs an m 16 and follows chef over the side.}
