<L>__{interior mrs jennings's house study day}
<A>__{elinor is waiting. the maid announces edward and he walks in momentarily. they are alone for the first time in months and for a moment, neither speaks.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{mr ferrars.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{miss dashwood.}
<A>__{elinor indicates a seat for him but neither sits.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{thank you for responding so promptly to my message.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i was most grateful to receive it. i miss dashwood, god knows what you must think of me...}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{mr ferrars }
<A>__{he interrupts her, desperate to explain.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i have no right to speak, i know }
<A>__{elinor has to stop him.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{mr ferrars, i have good news. i think you know of our friend colonel brandon?}
<A>__{edward looks completely bewildered.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{yes, i have heard his name.}
<A>__{elinor starts to speak rather faster than usual.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{colonel brandon desires me to say that, understanding you wish to join the clergy, he has great pleasure in offering you the parish on his estate at delaford, now just vacant, in the hope that it may enable you and miss steele to marry.}
<A>__{edward cannot at first take it in. elinor sits down.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{colonel brandon?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{yes. he means it as testimony of his concern for for the cruel situation in which you find yourselves.}
<A>__{now edward sits in shock.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{colonel brandon give me a parish? can it be possible?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{the unkindness of your family has made you astonished to find friendship elsewhere.}
<A>__{edward looks at elinor, his eyes full of growing comprehension.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{no. not to find it in you. i cannot be ignorant that to you to your goodness i owe it all. i feel it. i would express it if i could, but, as you know, i am no orator.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{you are very much mistaken. i assure you that you owe it almost entirely to your own merit i have had no hand in it.}
<A>__{but edward clearly believes she has been instrumental in the offer. he frowns slightly before speaking with rather an effort.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{colonel brandon must be a man of great worth and respect ability.}
<A>__{elinor finds some relief in saying at least one thing that she truly means.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{he is the kindest and best of men.}
<A>__{this makes edward seem even more depressed. he sits silent for a moment but then rouses himself to action.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{may i enquire why the colonel did not tell me himself?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i think he felt it would be better coming from... a friend.}
<A>__{edward looks at elinor, his eyes full of sadness.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{your friendship has been the most important of my life.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{you will always have it.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{forgive me.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{mr ferrars, you honour your promises that is more important than anything else. i wish you both very happy.}
<A>__{they rise. she curtsies. he bows.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{goodbye, miss dashwood.}
<A>__{edward leaves silently. elinor stands stock still in the middle of the room.}
