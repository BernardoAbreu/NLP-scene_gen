<L>__{exterior crossroads on the moors night}
<A>__{tree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans down and we see a truck approaching. we are at a crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to have earned their literary reputation. the truck stops at the crossroads, the driver, mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler, climbs down. "moon shadow" ends.}

<A>__{loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams down. revealed among the sheep are two rudely awakened young american boys. they look exhausted. they both carry backpacks, two american kids on a jaunt in europe. they are both in their late twenties. it is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none too happily. pushing sheep aside they step out and stretch.}
