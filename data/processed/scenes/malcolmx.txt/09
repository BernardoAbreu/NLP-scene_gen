<A>__{because of the competition, laura and malcolm begin at high speed. in a moment they are executing the most intricate steps of the "flapping eagle" and the "kangaroo." malcolm starts boosting her over and around his hips, then boosting her over his shoulders. laura is the perfect partner. she loves it.}
<B>__{angle with the crowd}
<A>__{so does the crowd, who loves new stars. there are ad lib remarks: "go,}
<D>__{man, go." "hey, red." "mmmmmm ummm."}
<A>__{angle: shorty a big, fat, hefty black woman takes shorty out to the dance floor, and she takes the lead. as they do the lindy she is slinging shorty around like a rag doll. this woman slides him through her legs and shorty has had enough, he runs off the dance floor, and hides. two shot. laura and malcolm are, in the phrase, cooking on all burners now; and when they execute an especially intricate step, even hamp waves over. malcolm is sweating and flushed and enormously elated. he sees that people are watching him, goading him on. he notices that sophia, in particular, has not taken her eyes off him; she is clapping in time to his steps. seeing new stars in the making, the other dancers move to the side of the floor, marking time, yielding the dance floor to them. laura and malcolm go into a solo.}
<B>__{angles}
<A>__{the crowd loves it. malcolm and sophia are very aware of each other. the finale is the classic drag, with laura hanging limp around malcolm's neck as he capers off the dance floor to the spontaneous applause of the audience. close shot sophia (slo mo) clapping enthusiastically in open admiration. close shot shorty waiting to catch them as they come off. shorty is whistling and shaking his hand appreciatively. he is also looking out for his dance partner.}

<A>__{then his vision catches sophia, who is approaching him. she makes a simple, direct gesture, "want to dance?" malcolm eyes shorty and wordlessly glides into sophia's arms. angle the dance floor immediately from the glances of the other men at the dance, he is the cynosure of all eyes. he has new status. it's a heady feeling because she is the first white girl he has ever been with socially who is not an obvious whore. he begins to show off a little, cuts a few fine steps. two shot. they are dancing closer than before. sophia begins to rock his black world. close malcolm trying to play it cool but he is beginning to pant. not from the dancing, but from the situation: a gorgeous white chick asking for}
