<A>__{della flinches but no bullet tears through the back of her skull. she slams into the driver's seat and punches the door lock switch. she hits the four wheel drive button and presses the accelerator pedal to the metal. the explorer barely protests as its front tires claw and bounce over the six inch concrete row barrier. the barrier screeches along the underside of the frame. there is a loud scraaaaape noise as the car heaves over the barrier. then, the rear wheels bounce and claw over. the car fishtails momentarily.}
