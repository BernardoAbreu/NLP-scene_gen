<D>__{"and god said to abraham, 'take your son, your only son, whom you love, isaac, and go into the land of moriah and offer him there for a sacrifice upon a mountain that i will show you..."}
<L>__{interior yeshiva classroom day}
<A>__{a run down place. a dozen 12 year old boys sit at old fashioned desks. these are not hasidim, but orthodox jews: normal american kids in yarmulkes. the teacher, rav zingesser is young, overweight, acnescarred, good humored.}
<C>__{rav zingesser}
<D>__{and why did the holy one blessed be he do this? why did he ask abraham to sacrifice his only son, whom he loved?}
<A>__{two boys off to one side: avi (a smart, tough, brownnose) and danny (the eternal dissident) argue under their breath....}
<D>__{12 year old danny isaac wasn't his only son. ishmael was his son, too. 12 year old avi the only son he loved. 12 year old danny oh, they only kill them when they love them...? 12 year old stuart}
<P>__{(up front; answering zingesser)}
<D>__{it was a test of abraham's faith. of his devotion to god. 12 year old danny it's not about abraham's faith. it's about god's power. god says, "you know how powerful i am? i can make you do anything i want, no matter how stupid. even kill your own son. because i'm everything, you're nothing."}
<A>__{titters. danny looks around at his classmates: nerds, wankers, nose pickers. two kids in back furtively read the racing form under their desks. he hates them for their indifference as much as he despises stuart's piety or avi's ass kissing.}
<C>__{rav zingesser}
<D>__{but, danny, if hashem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge his actions? 12 year old danny we have free will and intelligence which god allegedly gave us....}
<C>__{avi}
<D>__{anyway, god never lets abraham kill isaac. he provides the ram so that 12 year old danny personally, i think that's a lie. i think he did kill him.}
<C>__{rav zingesser}
<D>__{you think?! based on what? 12 year old danny there's midrash supporting this. my father read a book by shalom spiegel that isaac actually died and was reborn.}
<C>__{rav zingesser}
<D>__{no one follows that midrash. 12 year old danny i do; i follow it. but okay, say god provided the ram. so what? once abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. he could never forget that. and neither could isaac. look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. by the end he can't tell jacob from esau....}
<A>__{the kids laugh. zingesser cracks a ruler against a desk.}
<C>__{rav zingesser}
<D>__{watch your language.... 12 year old danny}
<P>__{(rising impassioned)}
<D>__{i think the whole jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on mt. moriah, and we still live in terror.... 12 year old stuart fear of god is the beginning of wisdom. 12 year old danny fear of god makes you afraid of everything. all the jews are good at is being afraid. and being sacrificed.}
<A>__{oooo. crack, crack, crack. even the guys with the sports pages are shocked by that one.}
<D>__{12 year old stuart don't you believe in god? 12 year old danny i'm the only one here who does believe. you say he's mysterious, yet merciful. i see him for the power drunk madman he is. and we're supposed to worship such a deity?? i say never! i say...fight him. i say }
<A>__{the ruler has been cracking from "power drunk" on.... now zingesser grabs danny, yanks him out of his chair.}
<C>__{rav zingesser}
<D>__{avi ask rabbi springer to come remove danny from the class....}
<A>__{avi rises, grinning, as...danny struggles wildly to get free.}
<C>__{rav zingesser}
<D>__{and you, if you had come out of egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the golden calf. 12 year old danny then let him destroy me now. let him crush me like the conceited bully he is.}
<P>__{(to the ceiling)}
<D>__{go ahead. kill me. here i am. do it!!}
<A>__{the class sits frozen in terror, waiting for god to kill danny. but nothing happens.}
