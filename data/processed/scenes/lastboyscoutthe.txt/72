<L>__{interior hospital emergency room day}
<A>__{meanwhile, back at the ranch, jimmy is seated, shirtless, on a metal examining table. his ribs are taped. his arm in a cast. two men loom over him, sour expressions on their faces: sergeants mccaskey and bessalo. jimmy shakes his head, exasperated:}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{look, i will say it again for the cheap seats: i don't know anything and i can't help you. okay? can i go now?}
<A>__{bessalo grimaces in disgust.}
<C>__{bessalo}
<D>__{let me get this straight: you're walking along, minding your own business, when two guys you never met jump you and throw you in a ditch for no particular reason. is that it?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{that's it.}
<C>__{bessalo}
<D>__{you're full of shit, kid.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tell me where hallenbeck is.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{how the fuck should i know? try his house.}
<C>__{bessalo}
<D>__{we did. where is he?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{for chrissake, i just met the guy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look, sergeant. i don't give a shit about joe hallenbeck. i just busted my throwing arm and i'm in a real pissy mood, so you got two choices: either charge me with something or let me the fuck outta here.}
<A>__{he glares defiantly at bessalo.}
