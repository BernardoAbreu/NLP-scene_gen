<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{frank comes stumbling up the basement stairs with an old movie projector and a roll up screen.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<P>__{(entering)}
<D>__{what's all this?}
<A>__{frank sets the projector down and hands his mother the tiny ribboned box.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{go on.}
<A>__{jack watches from the kitchen doorway as mrs. baker pulls the ribbon off the box. inside is a tiny spool of film.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{why, what's this?}
<L>__{interior kitchen (later)}
<A>__{blank screen, curtains drawn, the room dark. frank clicks on the projector and picks up his cake. mrs. baker close on his elbow, sets her plate on her knees and watches the screen. jack sits off to the side. a title card appears: "for mrs. ellie baker, who made it all possible." mrs. baker gives frank a puzzled look. he just smiles. suddenly, images spring to the screen, obviously footage several years old, showing jack and frank as children, sitting at the tiny pianos, wearing matching suits, smiling matching smiles as they play for the camera.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{oh my god ...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{recognize these two characters?}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{i thought these were lost. where did you find ...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{in the attic. behind some of dad's stuff.}
<P>__{(pointing with his fork)}
<D>__{look, jack can hardly reach the pedals.}
<A>__{as frank's laughter fills the dark room, jack stares with cold fascination at the screen. suddenly, a jagged cut springs the boys a year later, in the same positions, smiling the same smiles.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{oh no!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together. boy, old man henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, jack?}
<A>__{jack says nothing.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{oh, look at you two. so skinny. and those tiny suits ...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{wait. watch. here comes dad.}
<A>__{jack's eyes narrow as the film jumps another year and a man enters the frame, obviously by accident. he is so tall his face cannot be seen. as he dances quickly out of sight, he ruffles jack's hair.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{that man.}
<A>__{as the film jumps again, jack glances at the photograph to his right. the images on the screen flicker softly off the glass of the picture frame.}
<C>__{mrs. baker }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{oh, look how you're growing. my little boys ...}
<A>__{jack's eyes drift from the photograph to his mother and brother, sitting close together in the love seat, laughing. after a moment, their voices fade and jack looks back to the children on the screen, like two tiny men, mirror images of one another. at first the changes are subtle. little jack's tie is askew, his shirt missing a button. but as the years flick by, the brothers resemble one another less and less, until finally, the little boy that was jack is completely gone and in his place is a slouching, tousle haired adolescent in rumpled coat and open collar, a cigarette hanging disdainfully from his lip. a woman's hand darts into the frame and plucks the offending cigarette away in a flash.}
