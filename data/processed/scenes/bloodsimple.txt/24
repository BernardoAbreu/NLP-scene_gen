<L>__{exterior open field sunrise}
<A>__{the staccato beat of the shovel slamming against earth drops out at the cut. there is perfect quiet. the sun is just peeping over the horizon. in the foreground ray is sitting in the open door of his car, smoking a cigarette. his gaze is fixed on a spot offscreen.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{a house. quite near by. the house and its perfect green rectangle of lawn are set incongruously in the middle of the open field.}
<B>__{back to ray}
<A>__{staring, without emotion. he takes one last, fierce drag on the cigarette, then flicks it away. he takes the shovel, walks over to the grave and stares at it for several seconds, shovel clasped firmly in both hands. he walks back to the car.}
<B>__{high shot}
<A>__{house, car and grave. ray throws the shovel into the car, gets in, and turns the ignition. the engine coughs weakly and dies. he tries again. same result. one more time. the engine coughs, sputters, and fires to life. the car runs over the grave and rattles on across the rutted field towards the highway in the distance.}
