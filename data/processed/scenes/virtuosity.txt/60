<B>__{on top of the garbage truck}
<A>__{parker lands on the back of the truck. right next the openingandclosing steel jaws of the truck's massive trash compactor. his gun tumbles from his hand, falling to the street. this sequence is identical to the one you previously witnessed. it is as if we've jumped back in time. sid 6.7 dives on top of parker, putting him flat on his stomach. and his face against the steel teeth. sid 6.7 chokes parker. hard.}

<D>__{i have to tell you, i do enjoy you, parker. i really don't want to have to kill you...}
<A>__{the sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck. parker and sid 6.7 battle next to the compactor's lethal jaws. the machine makes an awful, grinding sound. not unlike the sounds parker and sid 6.7 are making. the fight is primal. savage. and moving at 30 miles perhour.}

<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{let me put it to you this way... whether i'm here... or whether i'm not...i'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{where did you plant the c 4?!}
<A>__{he should concentrate more on fighting, and less on asking questions, because he's losing. parker takes a wicked shot to the face, and but then blocks the anticipated shot to his gun. sid 6.7 still manages to put parker's head between the compactor's jaws. which are closing. with every last ounce of effort he has, parker hurls his legs up into sid 6.7. which throws sid 6.7 into the compactor. sid 6.7 frantically tries to climb out of the compactor as the steel jaws close in on him. he gets his hands out. then his head... except parker now does something different. just before sid}
