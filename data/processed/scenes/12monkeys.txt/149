<L>__{interior movie screen theater night}
<A>__{spooky bernard herrman music, giant redwoods looming skyward. it's daytime in muir woods. scotty (james stewart) and madeline (kim novak) walk toward a display of a cross cut section of a redwood tree. we're watching hitchcock's vertigo.}
<C>__{scotty }
<D>__{here's a cross section of one of the old trees that's been cut down.}
<A>__{they look at the lines of the tree marked with cards that say, "birth of christ", "discovery of america", "magna carta signed", "1066 battle of hastings", and "1930 tree cut down: ". angle on the theater audience, empty seats dimly visible in the flickering light, a few shadowy moviegoers scattered here and there. angle on the screen, madeline pointing, saying with profound melancholy.}
<C>__{madeline }
<D>__{somewhere in here i was born. and here i die. there's only a moment for you. you don't notice.}
<A>__{angle on the audience, a shadowy couple near the back of the theater. we can't really see them, but we recognize their voices}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{here, let me help you.}
<A>__{the theater is briefly illuminated by a very bright scene on the screen, revealing enough of cole and railly for us to see she's doing something to his upper lip while he tries to watch the movie.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i think i've seen this movie before. when i was a kid. it was on tv.}
<C>__{railly}
<P>__{(fussing with his upper lip)}
<D>__{shh don't talk. hold still.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(moving his head to see the film)}
<D>__{i have seen it, but i don't remember this part. funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past. the movie never changes it can't change but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different you notice different things.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{if we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{flowers! what flowers?}
<A>__{from the darkness, a movie patron makes a sssshhhhh shound.}
<C>__{railly}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{it's an expression. here...}
<A>__{she's pulling something from a shopping bag at her feet, placing it on cole's head, adjusting it...}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{why are we doing this?}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{so we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music. so we can appreciate what we have while we have it. forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.}
<A>__{there are tears in her eyes. they discomfit cole.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{but maybe i'm wrong. maybe you're wrong. maybe we're both crazy.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{in a few weeks, it will have started or it won't. if there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring tv shows we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.}
<C>__{shadowy moviegoer}
<D>__{shhhhhhh}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{where can we hide for a few weeks?}
<A>__{angle on the screen, where scotty and madeline are in the foreground, the ocean behind them.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{you said you'd never seen the ocean...}
