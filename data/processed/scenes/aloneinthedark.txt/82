<A>__{the silhouettes of the five agents, burke, and miles come through the spotlight beams as they enter the museum. burke strides up to carnby and aline, who stand with agent barr. miles follows after him.}

<D>__{hat the hell are you doing here, carnby?}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{hey richie.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{it's commander burke. this is my unit.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{they saved our lives.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{you used to be able to take care of yourself, carnby. gotten soft since you left 713?}
<A>__{miles steps in between burke and carnby.}
<C>__{agent miles}
<D>__{ms. cedrac, i'm agent miles. this is commander burke.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{aline cedrac. pleasure to meet you. how's the ph.d. coming along?}
<A>__{aline looks surprised that burke knows so much about her.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{it's fine. thanks.}
<A>__{burke sees aline's arm is bleeding from the gashes clawed into her by the creature.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{miles, get her to a medic.}
<A>__{aline looks over at carnby. he nods to her.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{i will catch up.}
<A>__{agent miles escorts aline out of the museum. burke and carnby regard one another.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{why am i still looking at you?}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{i need to know what those things are.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{that information's classified. if you were still an agent, you'd already know. but since you're not, stay out of my way.}
<A>__{burke turns to stride away. carnby grabs his arm. burke turns back, annoyed.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{i'm asking nicely.}
<A>__{burke grabs carnby's arm, trying to twist it away. but carnby's fast enough to slip out of burke's hold. now angry, burke grabs carnby by the collar, shoving him against a stone column. but carnby deftly twists out of burke's grip and shoves him up against the same stone column. in the struggle, carnby's hand flicks into burke's pocket. agent barr intervenes, pulling carnby away. burke straightens himself out, trying not to look rattled.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{get him out of here!}
<A>__{carnby shrugs off agent barr and walks away.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{you're right, commander. i guess i have gone soft.}
<A>__{as carnby walks off, he looks down in his hand. he has lifted burke's i d card out of his pocket.}
