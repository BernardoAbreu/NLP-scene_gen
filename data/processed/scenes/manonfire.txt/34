<L>__{interior pinta's bedroom early morning}
<A>__{brushing her hair, pinta wanders to the window at the sound of a car hood closing. creasy is down below going over the car; a dark blue mercedes. as he checks underneath... the "car wash guy", pedro, trying to engage creasy. frank looks on, seems like he disapproves of pedro.}
<L>__{interior mercedes day}
<A>__{creasy sits grimly behind the wheel. pinta exuberant beside him. traveling route number one from home base to school. pinta looks at creasy's hands on the wheel. the back of the right one is swirled with scars.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{where are you from, creasy?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{the united states.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{i know. but which state?}
<A>__{creasy checks the rearview mirror. a banged up white toyota corolla pulls out behind him.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{no state in particular.}
<A>__{pinta frowns; this is going to take some work.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{my mom and me are from houston, texas. have you been there?}
<A>__{creasy has his eyes on the mirror.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{you can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?}
<C>__{creasy}
<P>__{(turns left)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i'm looking for potential.}
<A>__{creasy checks the mirror. the white corolla continues the way it was going. false alarm.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{potential? i don't understand.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. but you don't have to understand. i do. so no talking.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{are you going to quit? my last bodyguard quit.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{someone gave him more money than we could.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i'm a bargain.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in mexico?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{time will tell.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{there were 24 kidnappings in mexico city in the last six days. four a day. what do you think about that, mr. creasy?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{pretty impressive. maybe i need to up my fee or get a larger gun.}
<A>__{she looks at his scared right hand, then him. all curiosity.}
