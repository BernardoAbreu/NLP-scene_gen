<A>__{we are inside a customized car. the dashboard is covered in some sort of thin foam padding. the steering wheel and gear shift have the same padding. every corner and hard surface has been safe guarded. elijah sits behind the wheel of his car in the parking lot of the stadium. he sits as thoughts crash at his head. beat. he finally reaches for the keys and starts up the car. he looks into the rearview mirror and sees the man in the green army jacket pass behind his car. elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the parked cars heading out of the parking lot. elijah takes a deep breath and turns off the engine.}
