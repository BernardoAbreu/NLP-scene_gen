<A>__{the tyrant, still a bit sluggish, steps down from the platform that supported its tank. barry jams in a fresh clip and keeps firing at the thing. the tyrant, impervious, stalks after the big trooper. wesker is still on the floor, his arm through the doors, tugging on vickers' boot. the flesh on wesker's forearm is peeled by the bumpers as he uses all his strength to drag vickers' body closer... until the boot winds up in the opening, preventing the doors from closing. wesker manages to pull his bloody arm free. he rushes to a computer console and types a request for the "t" virus.}

<D>__{get under a desk, man. i'm gonna feed this thing a pineapple.}
<A>__{barry pulls a grenade from his belt.}

<D>__{no! it might damage the system! i've got to get this data!}
<A>__{wesker's m 16 has been lying, where he left it, on the console. he picks it up.}

<D>__{forget it. bullets don't work!}
<A>__{barry is about to pull the pin on the grenade when wesker triggers off a burst...into barry's gut!}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{they seem to work just fine.}
<A>__{barry is blasted across the lab. the tyrant makes its first quick move... making us appreciate how fast and powerful it really is. it swipes at barry's body as it flies through the air, catching it in it's steel claw. we hears bones snap as barry goes limp.}
<C>__{wesker }
<D>__{that's it. take a little lunch break, mr. "t". i just need a few more seconds.}
<A>__{the tyrant lifts barry's body, as if it were as light as a feather, up to its snout. recognizing that the man is dead, the monster flings him aside like so much garbage... and begins to lumber toward wesker.}
<C>__{wesker }
<P>__{(to the computer) come on, come on.. .}
<A>__{a monitor reads: 90% complete...95%...98%. wesker rests a finger on the button to eject a floppy. the tyrant is getting closer by the second. wesker fires a burst at it which only slows it for a heartbeat.}
