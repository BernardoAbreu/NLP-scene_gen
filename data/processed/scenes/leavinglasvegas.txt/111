<D>__{a shot of tequila, if you can spare it.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{ben smiles, happier than we've ever seen him. he gets her order ready and then he takes a big swig from a bourbon bottle. he sits on the edge of the bed. the bathroom door opens and sera comes in wearing a black bra and panties. she's acting the hooker now, tough and sexy.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{for two fifty we can do pretty much what you want. you've been drinking, so it might be better if i got on top, but the other way's fine too. i have some jelly in case you want to fuck my ass, that's up to you. if you want to come in my face, that's ok too, just try to keep it out of my hair, i just washed it... and my eyes, it stings.}
<A>__{she walks to the table and downs her tequila in one. then comes to the bed, where ben is sitting. she kneels, unzips his fly and begins sucking him. ben watches her, looks at her reflection in the closet mirror, reaches for the bottle and drinks some, being careful not to disturb sera. after a while sera comes up.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{do you want to fuck now?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{maybe another drink first. more tequila?}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{ok... whatever.}
<A>__{she takes the bottle and drinks. she goes down again. ben stops her.}
<C>__{sera}
<D>__{what's the story? are you too drunk to come?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(sincere)}
<D>__{i don't care about that. there's time left. you can have more money. you can drink all you want. you can talk or listen. just stay, that's all i want.}
<A>__{she looks at him, confused. she sees a strange look on his face. it throws her. this is a turning pointerior both of them are momentarily exposed. ben lifts the sheet and moves to one side, indicating that she should come into the bed. she's as confused as he is. she gets in with him and he hands her the bottle.}
