<L>__{interior apartment near bank}
<A>__{though an open window a fire escape can be seen and beyond it an angle of street and the bank. near the window in a corner is a tv set, and on the tv set we are seeing the shot of the police helicopter and the cop yelling on the bullhorn as seen from the tv copter. a couple of elderly men are sitting watching the tv set, ignoring the bank, which they can see in the flesh, as it were. outside we are hearing the copters, and on the tv set likewise, and the voice of the announcer.}

<A>__{there is a hammering at the door, and the men at the tv set barely have time to look around before several burly cops wearing flak vests and helmets and carrying sniper rifles with telescopic slights move through the room, ignoring the men. they move out onto the fire escape, a couple going up higher, settling themselves down to aim in their rifles on the front of the bank. a lot of ad lib dialogue, but what we note is the cops, as a man, take a look at themselves on the tv.}
