<L>__{exterior central park day spring}
<A>__{forsythia bushes are in bloom. carrie and miranda walk. they carry sandwiches.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{so, we're done with our last session and we're not allowed to talk for two weeks while we figure out if being together again is something we really want. and then we had to pick a place to meet and if we both show up on that day the past no longer exists. showing up is the promise we make to each other that we're willing to let it all go and move forward.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{can you do that?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i don't know. i have a lot of thinking to do.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{thinking or feeling?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{miranda you're a lawyer. you can argue both sides of any case but, why we feel what we feel isn't logical. it's emotional. sorry, harvard i'm afraid you're going to have to make this decision based on your emotions.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{well, then i'm screwed. i don't know what i feel.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{you will. there will come a moment when you'll know. and if it's: yes all that brilliant logic will go out the window... with the past.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{and i thought picking the place to meet was a challenge.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{where is it?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{the brooklyn bridge. halfway between both our places.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{very logical. and yet poetic.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{poetic if we both show up. otherwise you're on a bridge rejected. not a good plan.}
