<C>__{josie}
<D>__{nooooooo!}
<A>__{slow motion as josie lunges for aldys and pulls her to floor as tommy, off balance, dumps the dog food all down guy's front. the crowd stops dead, staring. the can, now empty, rolls slowly off the dance floor, the metal rolling noise echoing in the silence.}

<P>__{(indicating aldys)}
<D>__{why her, huh? what did she ever do to you? let me tell you something about this girl. she is unbelievable. i was new here, and she befriended me no questions asked. but you people, you were my friends only after my brother, rob...}
<A>__{she points out rob in the crowd. he's mortified.}
<C>__{josie}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but not as good as being myself.}
<P>__{(turns to crowd)}
<D>__{and to all of you there's a big world out there. bigger than prom. bigger than high school. when you get there, it won't matter if you were prom queen or the quarterback or the biggest nerd in school. what matters is that you don't regret who you were, who you are what if steven spielberg had quit the audio visual club because it wasn't "cool"? what if rosie o'donnell had stopped cracking jokes because someone told her they were stupid? what if michael jordan never went back to basketball after he got cut from his high school team?.}
