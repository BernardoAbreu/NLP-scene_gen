<A>__{xander tuck and rolls, comes up running. guards are running around, unsure just what the hell is going on. xander hops on one of the trials motorcycles parked nearby and fires up the engine. he hits a remote switch and blam! the explosive charge he left earlier blows up. he points the bike at a set of stone stairs. they form a "ramp" that he can use to jump the wall. he guns the engine. a guard races across the wall with a rifle, taking aim. xander races and jumps the bike over the wail. as he goes by he does a can can aerial, kicking the guard off the wall before he can shoot. the anarchy 99 guys run outside just in time to see him go.}
