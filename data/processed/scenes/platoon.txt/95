<L>__{exterior jungle stream day (rain)}
<A>__{the platoon moves along a shallow stream bordering the jungle. a thick rain falls amid cracks of distant thunder. chris, rhah, francis, big harold, others are at the rear of the platoon, their ponchos pulled over them like big sad grey tents. there's a holdup ahead and the men rest on rocks or stand. the rain makes a pointilistic pattern, the men collages of grey, their rifles slung upside down to keep dry. barnes is up ahead, out of the stream bank, on the radio.}
