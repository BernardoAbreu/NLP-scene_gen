<L>__{interior george ball's conference room day}
<A>__{excom meets in george ball's small conference room at the state department. bobby, in shirtsleeves, paces at the head of the table, very, very alone. all eyes are on him.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no. no. no. there is more than one option here. if one isn't occurring to us, it's because we haven't thought hard enough.}
<A>__{mcnamara squirms. the others react in frustration. cia chief john mccone, sharp, tough, conservative, is harsh.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{sometimes there is only one right choice, and you thank god when it's clear.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you're talking about a sneak attack! how'll that make us look? big country blasting a little one into the stone age. we'll be real favorites around the world.}
<C>__{acheson}
<D>__{bobby, that's naive. this is the real world, you know that better than anybody. your argument is ridiculous.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{you weren't so ethically particular when we were talking about options for removing castro over at cia.}
<A>__{and there's nothing bobby can say to that. he props himself up on the table, stares at it as if there's an answer in its shiny surface somewhere. there is only the reflection of his own face.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i can't let my brother go down in history like a villain, like a tojo, ordering another pearl harbor.}
<A>__{mccone, acheson, and taylor share a look. the last resistance to airstrikes is crumbling. finally, bobby looks up at mcnamara.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{bob. if we go ahead with these air strikes...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there's got to be something else. give it to me. i don't care how crazy, inadequate or stupid it sounds.}
<P>__{(beat, pleading)}
<D>__{give it to me.}
<A>__{mcnamara suffers under the gaze of everyone at the table, weighing the situation out. and finally he ventures.}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{six months ago we gamed out a scenario. it's slow. it doesn't get rid of the missiles. there are a lot of drawbacks.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the scenario was for a blockade of cuba.}
