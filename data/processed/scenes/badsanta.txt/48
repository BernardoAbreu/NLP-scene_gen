<L>__{interior chamberlain's winter wonderland day}
<A>__{on an upper floor of chamberlain's the theme is "the desert as winter wonderland." cacti and tumbleweeds are wrapped with lights and flocked with snow, and a team of nine stuffed burros are hitched to a sleigh. rudolfo the red nosed burro is tended by several santa's elf mannequins. one in cowboy wear and another in a poncho and sombrero. again there is a line of waiting children. marcus makes his way through the line as kids gasp and cheer. he plays to the crowd.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{merry christmas! santa's coming!}
<A>__{yayyyyyy! marcus gets to the head of the line, ducks under the velvet rope and goes behind the flimsy cardboard set. willie sits there morosely, head slumped, forearms on knees, red velvet hanging limply from one hand.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{what the fuck you doing, "fuck stick" in front of the boss?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i don't like that guy.}
<A>__{he takes a bottle from the floor by his feet and swigs off it. marcus stares at him.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you don't like any guy. you think i can't find another portly motherfuck can run a water drill?}
<A>__{willie just slumps there apologetically.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{don't tempt my hand. you blow this and we're broke for the year. so stop acting like you know something because, pal of mine, you don't know squat. you're gum on my shoe.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{yeah, yeah.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{now put on your fuckin' hat and get out there.}
<A>__{he grabs the hat, slams it into willie's chest and, as willie rises, kicks him in the ass. willie just takes it, shambling off.}
<D>__{marcus (cont'd ...and try to act professional. for chrissake!}
