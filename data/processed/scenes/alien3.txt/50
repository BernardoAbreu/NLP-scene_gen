<L>__{interior underground wheat fields night}
<A>__{ripley and john come up from the level below.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<A>__{john crosses himself. another testament to the terrible battle with the alien. reduced to just a huge, blackened floor. all the crops burned to ash their charred stalks mingled with the corpses of roasted monks. their nostrils assailed by the stench of the dead ripley would puke if she had any food in her body.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{there's andrew. and raphael. peter...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{stop. how far?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we're right below the abbey now.}
<A>__{they cross the smoldering field. the scorched floor threatens to give way under john's feet ripley pull him to one side.}
<B>__{the monastery level}
<A>__{heaven has become hell. the ground, the buildings, the sky timber all blackened. fires burn everywhere. air choked with gray smoke and dust pouring in from the orbiter's surface through rends in the vaulted ceiling.}
<B>__{ripley and john}
<A>__{climb through a hole where a trap door has been torn off it's hinges. they look at the grim tableau: monks impaled on their own pikes. tangled together in their own pungy stakes. alien cocoon material cobwebbed over their bodies.}
<B>__{the monastery}
<A>__{flickering fires lit the first few floor windows. ripley takes a step towards it reaches back and pulls john...}
