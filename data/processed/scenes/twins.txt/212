<C>__{vince}
<D>__{my life just got flushed down the toilet.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{you're wrong, vincent. your life's just about to begin.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{i'm genetic garbage.}
<A>__{julius shakes his head.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{vincent, we're twins.}
<A>__{vince looks at his brother.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(patronizing)}
<D>__{i know this is a touchy subject for you, julius. but the fact is, we don't look the same we don't act the same, we don't talk the same we don't dress the same.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{so how come if we're the same, we're so damn different.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{we had six fathers, vince. we're different parts of a lot of different people.}
<A>__{vince is starting to get interested again.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{and remember, i was taken to a beautiful island, protected, educated, loved, given every opportunity to grow, to dream, to create. but you had none of that.}
<A>__{vince remembers. all the bravado about loving being an orphan has gone now.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{you had nobody. nobody to love you, nobody to trust you, nobody to encourage you. all life taught you was that the only person you could count on was yourself.}
<A>__{tears begin to well up in vince's eyes.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{you're the missing part of my life and i'm the missing part of your life. and when we find our mother we can fill the missing part of hers. we won't be alone anymore, vince.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{we can be a family.}
<A>__{vince looks at his brother. a beat.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{a family? you really think so?}
<A>__{julius nods. vince thinks about it some more.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{with like thanksgiving dinner? and christmas trees...}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{... and a real home where you'll always be welcome.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{always?}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{even when you've been bad.}
<A>__{vince begins to brighten.}
