<L>__{interior apartment dawn}
<A>__{the doorbell rings. michael, asleep on his mattress on the floor in the middle of his wrecked bedroom, emerges from sleep and glances at his clock: it's 6:10 am. he staggers to the front door and opens it. the door is being held together with a string. agents #1, #2, and #3 are at the door, with four other cops backing them up. mrs. razzolini is standing behind them and staring, wide eyed, a look of horror on her face.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{morning, officers. can i help you? agent #1}
<P>__{(holding out a piece of paper to him)}
<D>__{search warrant.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(playing the gentleman, waving away the paper)}
<D>__{i believe you, officer. go ahead, we have nothing to hide. hello, mrs. razzolini!}
<A>__{mrs. razzolini turns her back on him and hurries away. the cops enter the apartment.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you'll have to excuse the mess... we had a few friends over last night... agent #1}
<P>__{(looking at the devastation)}
<D>__{oh, really? well, if i were you i'd get myself some new friends!}
<A>__{peter comes in, in his bathrobe, furious.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what the hell are you guys looking for, anyway? agent #1 probably the same things your friends were looking for last night! didn't mrs. razzolini bring you a package last sunday?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you mean the chocolate easter bunnies? we ate them already.}
<A>__{he starts to walk away.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{anyway, you have no idea how many packages we've been getting lately. it's hard to keep track of them. agent #1 maybe we can help.}
<P>__{(to his colleagues)}
<D>__{let's get to work!}
