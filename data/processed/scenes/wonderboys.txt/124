<A>__{grady bursts into the corridor.'}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{sara!}
<A>__{its empty. quiet. grady pauses. somewhere, a heavy metal door closes. grady rushes on.}
<L>__{interior new corridor}
<A>__{grady, limping badly, turns a corner and sees a door. he moves to it, pushes past...}
<L>__{interior stairwell continuous}
<A>__{...and finds himself standing in a stairwell. he leans out over the railing, peers down. it's a steep drop, very. steep, ending in a small rectangular space, a kind of basement office, with vending machines, plastic chairs, and a collapsible card table. grady turns back to the door he came through, pushes against it. locked. he sighs, looks back at the stairs, his ailing ankle, then sits. he fishes out the ziploc of marijuana, considers the perfectly roiled joint floating atop the bag of buds, but, for once, isn't up to it. the sound of footsteps echoes far below and, hopeful they're sara's, grady pulls himself up, peers over the railing. it's traxler, with a broom, a big plastic bag.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{yo, traxler.}
<C>__{traxler}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{hey, professor tripp.}
<A>__{grady considers the ziploc in his hand, looks down again.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{do you get high, sam?}
<C>__{traxler}
<D>__{only when i'm working.}
<A>__{grady hangs over the railing and lets fly the ziploc. it pinwheels through the vortex of stairs, lands at sam's feet.}
<C>__{traxler}
<D>__{holy shit. are you serious?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{as a heart attack.}
<C>__{traxler}
<D>__{thanks whoa, professor tripp, careful here...}
<A>__{grady is still hanging over the railing but looking dizzy now. his eyelids flutter and he tips forward a steinway on a window ledge and as he starts to drop... ...there is a sharp jerk on his collar, a shirt button caroms off his cheek, and slowly, he is hauled back.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{grady, what are you doing, you idiot?}
<A>__{grady looks up into sara's freckled face.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{looking for you.}
<A>__{he wants to say more, he opens his mouth, but then... all goes black as sara's voice calls... faintly at first, then more forcefully, calling grady's name, calling so insistently that the earth seems to rush upward until we see that she is... kissing him or something, and all goes softly... blue.}
