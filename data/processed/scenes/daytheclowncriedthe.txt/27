<A>__{helmut has had more than a few and really looks beaten and shoddy he waves for the bartender to bring another.}
<C>__{clause}
<P>__{(pouring still another blast)}
<D>__{it's your funeral.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(not too clearly)}
<D>__{a funeral is usually in order when someone dies.}
<A>__{up to now, we have no idea, whatever, as to the time (in history) we are indeed in germany, but as helmut downs another blast we slowly creep our camera to include more of the bar than we have seen before and it includes pictures, framed, of soldiers, arms interlocked (looking somewhat like summer camp stills), the german flag (1933 vintage crisscrossed with the swastika), a large banner marked "deutchland" ober aliss... and finally, the larger than life photograph of "hitler". helmut slowly crosses camera as he takes another drink and starts spouting again.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{the trouble with man today is that he takes everything for granted... he thinks things he's told to think... and accepts it! just because we know meanings of words we use them and we fool ourselves... people should use the dictionary more... look up words like good... bad... honest... loyal... especially loyal, i know what loyal means, and i have always been that... but does anyone care? no! of course not... only when it is expedient... when it isn't }
<P>__{(he slashes his throat with his finger)}
<D>__{ zipppp! you're out!}
<A>__{helmut stops with his back to camera looking straight at "hitler" and screams:}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{and that goes for you too... mine fuhrer...}
<A>__{he shoves his right arm up and out at the photograph of "hitler".}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{... you, too, are a fool. you allow yourself to think you have "loyal" followers... ha! wait until they've had it with you... you'll get yours... all the smiling, bowing, heel clicking idiots will shaft you too. and you will deserve it because if you allow people like herr schmidt to got about his business of lying, and cheating, and being disloyal, one day all the schmidts in germany will turn on you and you will finish as the dumb little corporal you started as, and never know what hit you...}
<A>__{during the above dialogue, two s.s. men along with two gestapo men walk into the bar and sit at a table unseen by helmut, and as they sit, helmut continues:}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{he really has to be stupid }
<P>__{(indicating hitler)}
<D>__{i could help him by telling him about the people he thinks are good germans... ha!}
<A>__{the two s.s. men and the two gestapo men just happened to stop in the pub, they can't really believe what they are hearing, and the two s.s. men make a move to get up and secure helmut. the head gestapo man nods to them to stay seated and wait and listen. helmut continues his rave and gets more violent as he goes on. clause, the bartender, would love to tell him the germans are there, but chooses to go about his business. helmut is really getting the effects of the booze now and is bordering on flipping his lid, completely. (he does the stagger routine trying to get to the table on the other side of the bar furthest away from where the s.s. men and gestapo men are sitting)... we play this for visual humor, but at the same time showing just how swacked he is!!! helmut finally reaches the table he has been trying desperately to get to and falls into it, exhausted and emotionally drained. he looks around at the few people who have been watching him, most of which are frightened at what he has said, trying vainly to stay out of it. helmut catches the eyes of the four men (s.s. and gestapo) just looking at him.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{what are you staring at? didn't you ever see a man drink before?}
<A>__{the four men just stare at him with no answer.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{what's the matter? haven't you guys got a sense of humor? you must have! look how you're dressed! grown men in their little soldier suits... and the black coats and gloves... like in a movie...}
<A>__{helmut gets up and walks over to their table... mumbling, and staggering as he goes...}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{real cloak and dagger stuff... didn't you gestapo guys ever know that everybody can spot you a mile away?}
<P>__{(leaning over and whispering)}
<D>__{listen, if you really wanted to be unnoticed... you should dress like plain people, then nobody would know you... you might even wear straw hats and shorts...}
<A>__{he hears this and gets hysterical laughing.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{straw hats and shorts!! that's funny! now that's really funny, isn't it? straw hats and shorts!}
<A>__{they just stare!}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{well, isn't that funny? think of it... that's funny! why don't you laugh?}
<A>__{helmut's pov the s.s. and gestapo men they are really staring now, hard to believe their ears and eyes.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(gets an idea)}
<D>__{i know why you're not laughing... because things you hear, you have to think about... i will show you something that you'll laugh at because all you'll have to do is watch...}
<A>__{director's memo!!! (insert chaplin footage) helmut goes over to the bar, where a little man is standing drinking his beer. alongside of the beer is a small plate with crackers and brown jam. helmut takes a comb out of his pocket, dips it in the man's glass of beer, combs his hair down over one eye, takes a finger full of the brown jam and makes a shicklegruber mustache from it... and turns on the four men yelling:}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{ve vill conquer the world... heil me! heil me! heil me!}
<A>__{he screams the last "heil" and collapses on the floor. the four men get up and proceed to pick him up and carry him out of the bar. as they get to the doorway and exit we stay on... ada who has just arrived to see them pick him up and carry him away. she is shocked. we stay on a closeup of her face showing the strain, pain and sadness as we:}
