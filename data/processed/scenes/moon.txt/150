<A>__{sam 2 driving along in his rover. he comes across another one of these jammers. he drives right up, ducks down, peering up through the windshield this new jammer is as tall as the others, in fact, it is identical in every way. how many of these things are there? sam 2 circles the jammer in the rover, drives on.}

<A>__{these are just his log entries. what's he looking for? sam 1 starts scrolling back through the log entries, like he's rewinding chapters on a dvd, showing himself at various stages of his time on selene his beard essentially growing in reverse as the messages stretch further back eventually sam 1 is clean shaven }

<A>__{sam 1 keeps typing in numbers. on the screen: "restricted. password required." no go. he tries to hack his way in, but is having no luck. one of gerty's long spindly arms slides into the room. sam backs away from the intimidating piece of machinery, but it stops within reach of the computer. sam 1 watches as the arm reaches forward and taps the password in for him. it leaves the room the way it came in. sam 1 continues to go further and further back and suddenly he pops up on the screen again or is it him? this sam up on the screen has stubble no beard and looks seriously ill he is barely able to talk in fact he's slurring }

<A>__{the sequence becomes a fast paced and nightmarish montage continuing to backtrack through the log entries showing yet more sams one has a moustache one has a shaved head one has grown out his hair and has a pony tail, we've seen this particular sam before in an earlier scene. but all the sams have one thing in common: towards the latter end of their log entries they all appear to be in very bad physical shape }

<A>__{sam 1 searches even deeper into the computer and uncovers yet more footage. we see the others sams returning to earth yet they don't seem to go anywhere when they blast off the return vehicle remains in its bay sam 1 views different sams blasting back to earth in the return vehicle always with the same result the return vehicle remaining in its bay, the sams seemingly vanishing. in one particularly grainy sequence sam 1 views gerty opening the lid to the cryo pod in the return vehicle and beginning to vacuum what appears to be dust or debris sam 1 understands now that the return vehicle is not a spacecraft, but some kind of incinerator.}
