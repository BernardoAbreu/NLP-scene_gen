<L>__{interior municipal stadium press box day}
<A>__{we get our fist glimpse of harry doyle, the indians' 55 year old radio announcer. harry's never walked past a bar in anger. he's been with the indians through thin and thinner.}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(on the air)}
<D>__{hello, everybody, harry doyle here, welcoming all you friends of the feather to another season of indians baseball.}
<P>__{(pouring some jack daniels in his coke)}
<D>__{a lotta new faces for the tribe this year, as they take on the defending american league champs, the new york yankees. and listen to the roar of the crowd as the indians takes the field!}
<A>__{doyle leans out the press box window with his mike, trying to pick up the sound of a couple guys clapping down below.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{yes, sir, they love this club here in cleveland.}
<A>__{doyle takes a hit of his spiked coke.}
<B>__{down on the field a yankee hitter}
<A>__{flies out to hayes, who makes a "basket" catch a la willie mays.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{high fly ball, centerfield. hayes under it now... oh, makes a basket catch, willie mays style, and the side is retired.}
<B>__{the indian dugout}
<A>__{the team comes in off the field to much enthusiasm and back slapping.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{all right, way to look, way to look. nice catch, hayes. don't ever fuckin' do it again. okay, let's get it goin'!}
<B>__{doyle in the press box}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{bottom of the first, willie mays hayes to lead it off for the tribe.}
<B>__{hayes}
<A>__{going through his warmup routine at the plate.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{a lotta people say you can tell how a season's gonna go by the first hitter of the year. in the last fifteen years, the indians have never had the season lead off hitter reach base.}
<A>__{hayes is in the batter's box now. the yankee pitcher winds and fires. hayes swings and hits a little dribbler toward the second baseman, who races in and scoops it up bare handed.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{hot shot toward the hole. rudia knocks it down, gets up, fires to first. too late! hayes beats it!}
<A>__{doyle leans out the window again trying to pick up some cheering.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{and so the string is broken. maybe things will turn around a little for the indians this year.}
<B>__{the bleachers}
<A>__{our four fans (from here on known as the bleacher band), overjoyed by hayes' hit, start beating the tom toms and singing a fight song they've composed called "in the land of burning waters" to the tune of the old hamms beer jingle.}
<C>__{bleacher band}
<D>__{in the land of burning waters, waters lurks the injun nine, oh so fine, we love those mighty redmen, turn their foes to dead men, ummmmm.}
<B>__{first base area}
<A>__{as hayes comes back to the bag, where the yankee first baseman is waiting for him.}
<C>__{first baseman}
<D>__{showed some real power on that one, slugger.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{i plan to get at least a double out of it.}
<A>__{hayes reaches in his back pocket and pulls out one of the pairs of black leather gloves he bought earlier.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{and now hayes is putting on a pair of black gloves, sending a little message to the yankees.}
<C>__{hayes}
<P>__{(to the first baseman)}
<D>__{bought a hundred of these, one for each base i plan to steal. excuse me, here, i gotta take my first step toward the hall of fame.}
<A>__{hayes takes his lead off and crouches, ready to steal.}
<C>__{first baseman}
<D>__{you look real sharp, but you'll never steal second with your shoe untied.}
<A>__{hayes looks down at his shoe. it's not untied. he notices too late that the pitcher is throwing over to pick him off.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{brewster, quick move to first...}
<A>__{hayes dives back for the bag, but never gets there; his face smashing up against the first baseman's glove, which is already holding the ball.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{he got him. hayes is picked off.}
<C>__{first baseman}
<D>__{nice base running, dildo. hard to get your thumb out of your ass with the gloves on.}
<A>__{hayes lies in the dust humiliated.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{well, so much for that.}
<A>__{doyle takes a long pull on his coke and we go into a montage depicting the indians' progressive disintegration in this game. we see: a) three fielders converging on a short pop fly into left field. they all collide and go down in a heap as the ball drops untouched. b) dorn playing a grounder off his hip. he fumbles it, picks it up, fumbles it again. no play. c) taylor crouched behind the plate, but up off his haunches, ready to throw. we hear the voice of his thoughts.}
<C>__{taylor's voice}
<D>__{guy's goin'. gotta be goin'... get the throw up. don't bounce the damn ball.}
<A>__{the runner on first takes off as the pitch comes in. taylor catches the ball and fires down to second. the ball sails three feet over the second baseman's head and on into center field. taylor stands there, disgusted.}
<C>__{taylor's voice}
<D>__{nice throw, dickhead.}
<A>__{d) cerrano striking out on a curve ball. he bawls his bat out on the way to the dugout. e) the three fielders we saw before, converging on another pop fly into short left. this time all three dive off at the last instant to avoid a collision. once again the ball drops untouched.}
<B>__{end montage. the scoreboard}
<A>__{it shows yankees 4, indians 0 after five innings.}
<B>__{doyle up in the booth}
<A>__{there are two empty coca cola cups near the mike. he's working on a third.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{top of the sixth. rookie sensation, ricky vaughn, on to pitch now. you can close the book on winters...}
<A>__{vaughn stands on the mound rubbing up the baseball with the same intensity we saw in the locker room.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{easy does it, ricky. we're only four down. we're still in this thing.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{don't worry if you're off the plate on a few pitches. doesn't hurt to put the fear of god in a hitter.}
<A>__{vaughn nods and continues to grind the ball as pepper and taylor leave. the yankee hitter steps in. vaughn winds and fires a screamer. taylor has to leap high to come down with it.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{first pitch is a little high...}
<A>__{the yankee hitter is slightly unnerved by this pitch.}
<C>__{yankee hitter}
<D>__{this guy kinda wild?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i figure you got a 30% chance to survive this at bat.}
<A>__{another pitch to the yankee hitter. it's outside.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{ball four.}
<A>__{another pitch to a second yankee hitter. it's low.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{ball eight.}
<A>__{another pitch to a third yankee hitter. he has to jump over it.}
<C>__{doyle }
<D>__{low, and vaughn has walked the bases loaded on twelve straight pitches. by the laws of probability, you'd think one of those coulda drifted over the plate.}
<B>__{the bleacher band}
<A>__{bobby gives the downbeat and, in honor of vaughn, the three men stand to pound out a version of "wild thing" on the tom toms. bobby does the vocal.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{wild thing, you make my heart sing, you walk everything.}
<A>__{pepper has reached the mound...}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{okay kid. i think we got 'em scared enough now. time to get a few of 'em out.}
<A>__{vaughn nods. he's plenty upset with himself.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{just relax, and keep the arm up on top. gotta throw strikes. no place at the inn for this guy.}
<A>__{he gives vaughn a pat on the butt, and goes back to the dugout. the yankee hitter, haywood, stands in. he's the first baseman who tagged hayes out.}
<C>__{haywood}
<D>__{hey, taylor, what you doin' back up here?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{couldn't cut it in the mexican league.}
<A>__{vaughn, determined to throw a strike, winds and delivers. the ball is a perfect strike, right down the middle. haywood crushes it to deep left field. vaughn drops his head, not even bothering to look.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{oh, shit...}
<A>__{the ball lands in the second deck; a grand slam home run.}
<C>__{pepper}
<P>__{(to brown)}
<D>__{looked like a strike anyway. you want me to go get him?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{no, let's see how he reacts.}
<A>__{vaughn paces around on the mound, rubbing up the ball. the next hitter, coleman, steps in. vaughn gets up on the rubber, his face set. he winds up and fires one right into coleman's back. coleman goes down in a hurry.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{interesting.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{at least he hit what he was aimin' at.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i think you can go get him now.}
<A>__{both benches are up on the dugout steps ready to come out. the only thing holding them back is that coleman is being tended to by the trainer. the home plate umpire thumbs vaughn out of the game. vaughn comes down to protest, but pepper quickly grabs him and hurries him off the field.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{c'mon, kid. as soon as coleman gets up, he's gonna be lookin' for you.}
<A>__{coleman finally gets to his feet, still a little shaken. he looks around for vaughn, but he's already disappeared into the dugout. coleman walks down to first under his own power. brown signals for a new pitcher and the players on both sides begin to return to the benches.}
<B>__{vaughn}
<A>__{walking alone down the tunnel to the locker room. he angrily knocks one of the overhead light bulbs out with his glove. doyle in the press box later that night he now has five empty cups next to the mike, plus a near empty bottle of jack daniel's.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{so, a tough start for the erie warriors, as they drop a heartbreaker to the yankees, nine to nothing. the post game show was brought to you by...}
<P>__{(searching for the paper)}
<D>__{christ. i can't find it. the hell with it. this is harry doyle saying good night, everybody, and happy hunting.}
<A>__{with that doyle passes out on his face.}
<B>__{rachel phelps}
<A>__{in her private box at the stadium. with her are donovan and butler.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(getting up to leave)}
<D>__{we're off to a good start, gentlemen. let's keep it up.}
<A>__{we go to donovan. he watches rachel go in disgust.}
