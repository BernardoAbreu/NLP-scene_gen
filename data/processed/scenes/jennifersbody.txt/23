<A>__{needy stumbles into her bedroom, overwhelmed. her clothes are smoke damaged and her cheeks are sooty. she grabs her cheap, taped up cell phone and dials chip's number shakily.}
<T>__{cross cut: phone call:}
<L>__{interior chip's bedroom continuous}
<A>__{chip's bedroom is pitch black until a cheap cell phone lights up under the covers illuminating his sleeping form, clad only in jockey shorts.}

<P>__{(sleepily)}
<D>__{hey, niedermeyer.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{thank god you're there. i hoped you were sleeping with your phone.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{jennifer's gone. she ran off with that rock band. and the carousel burned down.}
<A>__{chip sits bolt upright}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{like, burned down? to the ground? is everyone okay?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{no. i think they're mostly dead.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{shit. you're okay, right?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{we went out the bathroom window. everyone else was trying to use the door. it was like a stampede. the people who fainted got run over and you could hear their bones breaking.}
<C>__{needy }
<D>__{there was all this screaming and popping, like a million black cats all going off at once. and the smell...}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{this is real, right? this isn't just, like, some crazy dream like last time?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{no! anyway, it took me like an hour to walk home. but jennifer's still with those creeps! they had one of those white molester vans with no windows. the back was all blacked out.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{who cares about jennifer and those douchebags with douchebag haircuts? people just burned to death. in our town!}
<A>__{the doorbell chimes.}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(frantic)}
<D>__{oh cheese and fries! someone's here. i'm alone, chip. i'm freaked out!}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{where's your mom?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{swing shift. listen, i will call you in a minute. stay awake.}
<C>__{chip}
<P>__{(sleepily)}
<D>__{holla back.}
<A>__{needy hangs up the phone and rushes downstairs. as she passes through the shadowy kitchen, appliances hum all around her. the silence is menacing.}
