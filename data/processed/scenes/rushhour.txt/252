<A>__{colonel lee screeches to a stop 500 feet from the bulldozers, angling the mercedes so the driver's door is facing them.}
<L>__{exterior santa monica freeway day}
<A>__{the windows on the mercedes glide open.... carson hurries to catch up to it... colonel lee fires a rocket at the bulldozers through the driver's side window. the backblast from the launcher vents through the passenger's side. the rocket impacts the bulldozer on the left; the explosion actually flips the huge machine head over tail into the air. the bulldozer lands upside down on the lane divider, crushing a portion of it. colonel lee rolls up his windows and drives around the burning wreckage. the other drivers really give him wide berth now...}
