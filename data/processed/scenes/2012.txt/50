<A>__{a crudely animated film starts to play. charlie narrates on screen in an overly dramatic fashion.}
<C>__{charlie's voice}
<D>__{in the year 2012 a cataclysmic event will unfold. caused by an alignment of the planets in our solar system that only happens every 640,000 years... just imagine the earth as an orange...}
<A>__{charlie appears as an animated figure holding an orange.}
<C>__{charlie's voice }
<D>__{... our sun will begin to emit such extreme amounts of radiation, that the core of the earth will melt that's the inside part of the orange, leaving the crust of our planet free to shift.}

<C>__{charlie frost }
<D>__{pretty neat, huh? it's a big hit on youtube. i did the animation myself.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i know what you're thinking. but all the governments know about this.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{if they all knew, don't you think somebody would tell us?}
<C>__{charlie frost}
<D>__{they can't. just think about it. first the stockmarket would crash...}
