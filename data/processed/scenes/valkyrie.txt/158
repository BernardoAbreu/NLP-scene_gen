<L>__{interior war ministry fromm's office later}
<A>__{stauffenberg, olbricht, beck, mertz and haeften, the last of the conspiracy, are held at gunpointerior a smug fromm enters, followed by herber, the fat general, remer and numerous gun toting officers.}
<C>__{fromm}
<D>__{if you have any last messages, you'd better write them now.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{my actions speak for me.}
<P>__{(to his men)}
<D>__{i'd rather my wife and children remember our last time together.}
<A>__{the others bravely nod in agreement. but then:}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i'd like a pistol, please.}
<A>__{stauffenberg looks at beck with surprise.}
<C>__{beck }
<D>__{for personal reasons.}
<A>__{fromm thinks about it, then matter of factly hands beck a pistol. remer quickly steps forward.}
<C>__{remer}
<D>__{general, my orders are to deliver the prisoners alive.}
<C>__{fromm}
<D>__{noted, major.}
<P>__{(to beck)}
<D>__{get on with it then.}
<C>__{remer}
<D>__{but, sir }
<C>__{fromm}
<D>__{that will be all, major.}
<A>__{fromm glares at remer who angrily backs down. then he turns to beck and with a casual wave of the hand:}
<C>__{fromm }
<D>__{continue.}
<A>__{the moment is surreal. beck, seated at the desk, looks at each of his fellow conspirators. a look of thanks, goodbye. with a badly trembling hand he places the gun to his temple.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i'm thinking of earlier times...}
<A>__{close on: the conspirators turn away, unable to watch. except stauffenberg.}
<B>__{bang.}
<A>__{and as if none of the last minute has even occurred, fromm turns to the other conspirators.}
<C>__{fromm}
<D>__{very well then... a court martial, convened by me in the fuhrer's absence, has pronounced sentence: colonel mertz von quernheim, general olbricht, lieutenant haeften...}
<P>__{(glaring at stauffenberg)}
<D>__{and the colonel, whose name i will not mention, are condemned to death.}
<P>__{(to his men)}
<D>__{take them outside.}
<A>__{remer is clearly upset by this. herber, on the other hand, seems clearer than ever. he nods to his men who drag the conspirators out. herber personally takes stauffenberg by the arm. the two men share a look. nothing needs to be said. each has found his place. stauffenberg turns to confront fromm. he is weak, white from fatigue and loss of blood.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{the fuhrer will want to put us on trial, make an example of us. this won't win you any favor. and it won't hide you're involvement.}
<C>__{fromm}
<D>__{involvement. i don't know what you }
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{you knew and you did nothing. you're just as guilty as we are. even more so.}
<C>__{fromm}
<D>__{spare me, stauffenberg.}
<A>__{and those words bring a genuine smile to stauffenberg's face. he almost pities fromm now.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{no one will be spared.}
<A>__{and as fromm motions for herber to take stauffenberg away, we hear music, faintly at first accompanied by the subtle hiss and crackles of a phonograph... it is the piece stauffenberg and nina were dancing to one night long ago... over this: a voice. a man speaking in german faint at first, crackling over the radio.}
<C>__{hitler }
<D>__{my comrades. once again i don't know how many times it has been now an attempt has been made on my life.}
