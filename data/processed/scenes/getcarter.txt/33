<A>__{two men in long grey coats wait in silence. the coffin appears. expertly, they take it and swing it on to a trolley. they push it up the wide corridor towards the furnace. one of the men starts whistling cheerfully.}
<L>__{exterior crematorium day}
<A>__{margaret is thirtyish, blonde, attractive in a tarty kind of way. her heels are too high and she is wearing a cheap pair of sunglasses. she walks quickly away, down the cloisters, past the memorial tablets and urns. carter comes out of the chapel and sees her.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{margaret.}
<A>__{margaret stops and looks round. carter joins her. i thought you weren't coming.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{changed me mind.}
<A>__{they face each other in silence. margaret looks past carter and sees doreen watching them at the end of the cloisters. she turns away and starts walking slowly. carter moves with her. margaret continues nervously.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{everyhing go off all right?}
<C>__{carter}

<A>__{margaret stops in her tracks and looks back at doreen. she's still watching them.}
<C>__{margaret}

<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{what do you mean? you've been frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. you're closer to her than anyone.}
<C>__{margaret}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{no. no. it's not like that. i've got a husband, you know.}
<A>__{margaret starts walking again, fast. carter catches hold of her arm and stops her.}
