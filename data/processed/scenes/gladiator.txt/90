<L>__{exterior colosseum arena day}
<A>__{maximus is fighting a thick giant of a man. a few quick blows and the giant falls like a mighty tree he crashes to the sand. the arena cheers their hero. maximus stands over the beaten giant. the crowd waits for the famous act. maximus salutes the giant and tosses down his sword, refusing to kill. he walks away. the arena explodes in cheers a chant of "maximus the merciful" grows to deafening proportions. suddenly the arena is filled with praetorians they block maximus' exit from the arena the crowd boos horrified the praetorians surround maximus. he is unarmed, but coils for the inevitable battle. then the praetorians part... and commodus walks through them. he carries something wrapped in a rich cloth. maximus glares at him. the praetorians move back and the crowd watches eagerly. the emperor and the gladiator, at last. maximus and commodus stare at each other. the crowd cannot hear what is said, but strain to observe this incredible confrontation.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{brother... we've taken a sad path since we were children at capri, have we not?}
<A>__{maximus doesn't answer.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{for my own part... i am sorry it came to this. and to you alone of all men, i acknowledge my errors. and my regret. i shall live with my sin for all my days.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{as will i, commodus. as will i.}
<A>__{commodus unwraps the cloth bundle. inside is a small wooden sword. he holds it up so the crowd can see. a collective gasp. the wooden sword, prized by all gladiators above all else. freedom.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{as the first act of my contrition i offer you the wooden sword of freedom.}
<A>__{he holds out the wooden sword. a beat.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{take it, brother. stand at my side as a free man worthy of your ancestors.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i only have ancestors because of you, brother. you killed everything that ever lived alongside me.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{take it, maximus. let us heal that fatal wound together.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{this is the new home you cursed me to. and i am safer here from your treachery than i could ever be outside.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{will you always mistrust me?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{why don't you ask your father that?}
<A>__{commodus visibly flinches at that, but still holds the wooden sword out. the crowd is breathless.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i have more power as a slave in the arena than i could ever have as a free man. as the colosseum goes, the people go. as the people go, the empire goes.}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(tense)}
<D>__{you think this is power? i could show you power, slave }
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{no, caesar... i will show you.}
<A>__{with that, maximus does the unimaginable. he simply turns his back on the emperor and walks away. and the crowd goes mad. they cheer the defiant gladiator, their champion. and, equally, they deride the emperor. they mock him by holding out food and trash like commodus is holding out the wooden sword. they laugh and jeer. commodus glances around at his children, lost. then he turns to the imperial box. he sees lucilla slipping out the back of the box. he watches her go. and the crowd continues to jeer.}
