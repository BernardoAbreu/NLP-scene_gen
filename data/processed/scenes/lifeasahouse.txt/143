<D>__{please...i can't.}
<A>__{george is in real pain as he drops to the floor on his back. he winces and cries out as he pushes himself forward with his legs toward the dresser. george suddenly stops pushing; his legs slump flat on the concrete floor. his eyes flutter shut as guster continues to lick his face.}
