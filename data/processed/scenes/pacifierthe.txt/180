<A>__{mr. chun guards the kids, eyeballing them icily. lulu "looks" scared. but behind her back, we reveal her hands untying her ropes! freed, she hits her panic button! o.s., beeping. lulu grins hopefully: shane's coming! a beat... then mr. chun pulls the tracker from his pocket. he sneers.}
<C>__{mr. chun}
<D>__{think i'm stupid? now stop bothering me.}
<A>__{lulu frowns, then leans back against zoe. with a rapid blur of finger work, she unties zoe! then needing a distraction, she signals tyler and crosses her eyes. tyler gasps, horrified and screams his lungs out. chun spins, startled and lulu quickly rolls across the room! she lands against todd, quickly assuming a fake bound position, as if she hadn't moved. mr. chun whirls the kids look innocent. mr. chun is confused for a second: "wasn't he tied to the other one?"}

<A>__{behind todd lulu frantically unties todd's ropes it's gonna be close... chun scowls. skeptical, he steps closer... he leans down to look at todd's ropes z }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{now peter!}
<A>__{peter squirts juice into mr. chun's face. the kids use the distraction: todd pops to his feet, then leaps into his spin kick: it connects with mr. chun's head.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{all the kids bounce up. they untie julie, then scoop up peter and tyler. mr. chun growls and starts to stagger up. lulu lands in karate stance and calls out:}
<C>__{lulu}
<D>__{hi ya!}
<A>__{the other kids take off, mr. chun looks at lulu. mr. chun laughs:}
<C>__{mr. chun}
<D>__{that's cute.}
<A>__{ham without warning, lulu sweeps mr. chun's leg, he drops to his knees in pain, then, when he's at her level, she kicks him right in the nuts. it hurts. mr. chun tries to grab her by the wrist, but lulu evades with her cool, snake like move. lulu runs, slamming the door behind her. mr. chun gets up and turns the doorknob, but the door won't budge...}
