<A>__{in a hail of shattered glass, agents barr (male), cheung (female), and marko (male) burst through the skylight, rappelling down on zip lines from the hovering helicopter. they each carry a sleek, high tech assault rifle with a lamp mounted on the top. they all wear full bureau 713 combat gear, body armor with a headset comm link and a helmet with a dark visor mounted on it. the creatures hiss in reaction and scramble out of the spotlights from the helicopter. the agents immediately open fire. their bullets glow with a pulse of yellow light as they streak through the air. all carnby and aline can see is the agents shooting glowing bullets into the unnaturally long shadows. but the squeal of one of the creatures shows that the agents' bullets have found their target. as the glowing bullets hit the creature, it momentarily flashes visible, then invisible again. the two invisible creatures scatter, slipping away into the shadows. the agents cut their zip lines, dropping to the ground. as they land, they all flip on their rifle mounted lamps. the bright blue beams cut through the darkness. their movements are precise, controlled. they all have their rifles out, scanning the area. agent barr has a high tech scanning device attached to his rifle. it is an updated version of carnby's para meter that monitors the electromagnetic energy in the vicinity. it is used to detect the presence of the xenomorph creatures.}

<A>__{agents cheung and marko open fire, sending streams of glowing bullets across the main hall. but they don't hit anything. agent barr scans around with his rifle mounted para meter and lamp. nothing. carnby and aline stand back, not wanting to get in the agents' way, not equipped to really help. the dim lights suddenly flicker and come back on at full strength, bathing the debris of the battle in a warm glow. agent barr turns his rifle to carnby and aline. they stand their ground, facing him.}
