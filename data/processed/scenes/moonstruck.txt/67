<L>__{interior insinuation day}
<A>__{loretta approaches a young woman, mer, who works there. mer is about thirty, trendily dressed, and french. mer and loretta greet and talk. loretta makes vague gestures trying to convey what she wants, but the truth is she doesn't know what she wants. mer takes the situation in hand. there follows a montage of mer showing loretta various dresses, some outlandish, some beautiful, some incomprehensible. loretta tries on several of the dresses in a big triple mirror. some horrify her, some frighten her because they're so sexy, one bores her. we don't see the dress that she ultimately does buy.}
