Through the glass doors we see TATIANA, the Dowager Empress, 60, imperious and bedecked with jewels, she is seemingly unapproachable. TSAR NICHOLAS and his SON are with her. In the other elevador, ALEXANDRA and her daughters - well, all her daughters except. . .

As the ribbon falls out of her hair and down her back, Anastasia kicks it to Sonya without breaking stride. Tatiana sees her and can't help but smile. The music suddenly becomes a FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS. SERVENTS open the elevador doors as the ROYAL FAMILY steps out and begins a procession through their subjects. Tatiana holds out her arm to Anastasia as she makes it to Tatiana's side just in time. Anastasia has a beautiful but slightly impish face, dominated by large, blue, mischievous eyes. She an abundance of energy and confidence for a girl her age. "THE RULARS OF RUSSIA" (OPENING NUMBER) The elegant guests sing their admiration as the beautiful and happy Romanov family makes it's entrance into the ball, they're "the pride of all Russia". Vladimir invites Sophie to dance and the entire glittering assembly assembly swings into a GLORIOUS SWEEPING WALTZ. Singing their certainty that the Romanovs will rule forever. During the above, the ball is in full swing. Beautiful COUPLES swirls across the dance floor, including Anastasia dancing gracefully with her father. Under a long buffet table, we see DMITRI, 11, darkly handsome, dressed in ragged servant clothes, with a shock of dark hair which continually falls across his eyes as watches the guest enviously. Anastasia, still waltzing with her father, sees him. SERVENTS cross the room carrying a trays of BEAUTIFUL TROPICAL FRUIT. The guests "Ew" and "ah" at the sumptuous fruit. Anastasia sees Dmitri eyeing it hungrily and without missing a dance step, she grabs an orange off the tray and tosses it to Dmitri. He catches it and smiles broadly at her. Suddenly, A HAND grabs Dmitri and pulls him out from under the table. It's IVAR, the HEAD SERVENT, who pulls Dmitri into an open wall panel.}
