<L>__{interior nadia's bedroom day}
<A>__{it's empty. he slips inside. stuff everywhere. cigarette cartons, several lighters, spare wool, suitcase, rucksack. huge poster of bruce springsteen on wall. warily, he opens the bedside drawer: different coloured bras and knickers. in her open suitcase lies a small wooden chest. he lifts it out and puts it on the bed, hesitates, then opens it. a pair of russian army field binoculars. he puts them on the bed beside him. a small silver pistol, the size of a derringer. he studies it, and pulls the trigger. it's a cigarette lighter. a brochure of prospective husbands provided by the marriage agency. after a dozen or so photos he comes across his page but the photo has been cut out. he sees his name in the strange lettering, under the hole.}
