<L>__{exterior american encampment night}
<A>__{a nightmare. screams of agony. a few hundred battered, patriot survivors treat their wounded and prepare to move out. the battle, so bloodless and beautiful at a distance, has, in its aftermath, become horrifically painful and ugly. marion and gabriel ride into camp, passing nervous sentries and a field surgery which is surrounded by pools of blood and amputated legs and arms. marion sees harry lee at a make shift command post, barking orders, trying to pull things together.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{damn you, sergeant, don't move the wounded twice, put them straight on the wagons from the surgeons.}
<C>__{patriot sergeant}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{lieutenant, detail men for outriders. we move out as soon as the wounded are ready.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{the lieutenant rushes off. lee notices marion and gabriel, surprised to see them. he jerks his head for them to follow him into: lee's command tent once out of sight of the men, lee loses his command bearing. exhausted, he leans on his campaign table and looks closely at marion, asking with his eyes why marion is here.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{green dragoons came to my home, killed my son, thomas. it was tarleton himself.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i'm sorry i wasn't here for this.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{there's nothing you could have done, gates is a damned fool.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{we saw.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break cornwallis was muzzle to muzzle. he spent too many years in the british army.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{where is he now?}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{who's in command?}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i am, i think.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{what are my orders?}
<A>__{lee gives marion a tired smile.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{if you want orders, i've got some for you.}
<A>__{lee rolls out a map for marion and gabriel.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{we're a breath away from losing this war. in the north, washington is reeling from valley forge, running and hiding from clinton and twelve thousand redcoats.}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{here in the south, cornwallis has broken our back. he captured over five thousand of our troops when he took charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and new york.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{so now cornwallis will head north, link up with clinton and finish off washington.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{and patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{unless we can keep cornwallis in the south until the french arrive. a treaty was signed at versailles after our victory at saratoga. the french are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{fall, six months at the earliest.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{long time.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{the bigger problem is where, not when. the french fleet won't sail north of the chesapeake for fear of early storms.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{so you're going to try to keep cornwallis in the south until then.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{not me, you. i'm going north with every continental regular i can find to reinforce washington or he won't last six weeks.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you expect cornwallis to be held here by militia?}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{not held, just slowed down.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{they're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard. they'd be better off letting it move on.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{they'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{how many men does cornwallis have under his command?}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{... including the green dragoons under tarleton.}
<A>__{at the mention of tarleton, marion nods.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i will do what i can.}
<A>__{lee quickly writes something.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i'm giving you a field commission as a colonel.}
<A>__{he hands it to marion. gabriel steps forward.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{colonel lee, i request a transfer to colonel marion's command.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{granted.}
<A>__{lee scribbles another order and hands it to gabriel. then he turns to marion.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{good luck.}
<A>__{marion nods. they duck out of the tent.}
