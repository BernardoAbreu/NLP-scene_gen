<A>__{dorm "coat" room panting, veronica collapses at a desk in the "coat" room. she draws a vodka bottle from a stockpile of liquor and pours some in her beer cup, slouching down in her chair. veronica lights a match from a 7 11 matchbook. she eerily brings her hand closer and closer to the fire until it touches. with an eek of pain, she tosses the match away into the vodka cup, setting it afire. veronica laughs to herself before tossing the flaming cup out the window.}
