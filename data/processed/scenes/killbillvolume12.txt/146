<A>__{the red pickup t bones the trans am, the gold and black car flies through the air, then rolls over and over about five times in the desert sand and dirt...ending upside down. the dirty blonde looks out her windshield at the wreckage of the black and gold sports car. a smile with the slightest hint of satisfaction, spreads across her face. she hops out of the truck and into budd's camper.}
