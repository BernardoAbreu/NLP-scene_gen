<A>__{brooklyn street corner day travis stands near the corner wearing his boots, jeans, western shirt and army jacket. he pulls his aspiring bottle out of his pocket, shakes three or four into his palm, pops them into his mouth and chews. an "off duty" taxi pulls up to the curb. travis gets in.}
<B>__{inside taxi}
<A>__{dough boy leans back from the wheel and greets travis as he enters.}
<D>__{dough boy hey travis. this here's easy andy. he's a travelling salesman.}
<A>__{in the back seat, beside travis, sits andy, an attractive young man about 29. he wears a pin striped suit, white shirt and floral tie. his hair is modishly long.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{hello travis.}
<A>__{travis nods as the taxi speeds off. dough boy slows down near an economy hotel. not a flop house, but not do fancy they care what the guests do in the privacy of their rooms.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{this is fine, dough boy}
<P>__{(to travis)}
<D>__{pay dough boy here.}
<A>__{travis pulls a twenty out of his pocket and gives it to dough boy.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{20 bucks? dough boy}
<P>__{(takes bill)}
<D>__{yeah. hey thanks. that's real nice, travis.}
<A>__{travis and andy get out of the cab and walk toward the hotel. dough boy pulls away. as they enter the hotel, they pass a junkie, stoned out and spread eagled across the hood of a derelict old blue dodge.}
