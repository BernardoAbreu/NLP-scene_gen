<L>__{interior klingon bird of prey quarters (vfx p)}
<A>__{a dimly lit room somewhere in the bowels of the klingon ship. like every other room on this decrepit ship, the room looks well worn and ill maintained. soran is seated behind a table, holding the visor. a padd and soran's pocket watch sit on the table. geordi is sitting in a chair across from him his shirt has been removed. he looks very tense.}
<C>__{soran}
<P>__{(re: visor)}
<D>__{a remarkable piece of equipment... but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more... normal?}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{what's normal?}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{normal is what everyone else is... and what you are not.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<A>__{soran takes a moment.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{as you may or may not be aware, i am an el aurian. some people call us a race of "listeners". we listen.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{right now, mr. la forge, you have my undivided attention. i want to listen to everything you know about trilithium. and me.}
<A>__{geordi thinks.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{trilithium is an experimental compound developed by the romulans. i think it's a derivative of }
<A>__{soran picks up the padd from the desk and activates it. suddenly something small, with sharp edges, can be seen moving just underneath geordi's skin near his chest. geordi moves his hand to the spot, but then the protrusion is suddenly gone.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{i don't want a science lecture. you were on that observatory looking for trilithium... why?}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{i was ordered to by the captain.}
<A>__{on the padd in soran's hand, we can now see an interior graphic of geordi's body sitting in the chair. the graphic is interactive, moving as geordi moves. a blinking dot represents the movement of the probe inside his body. right now, the dot is in the middle of his chest.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner interrogator banter, shall we? you have information, and i need it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{did the captain explain his orders to you? did he say why you were searching for trilithium?}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{what about... guinan? what has she told you about me?}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{guinan? i don't know what you're talking about...}
<A>__{on the padd, we now see the dot has moved to a position next to geordi's heart. soran looks up at geordi.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{my instincts tell me you're lying. and i know that can't be easy for you...}
<P>__{(off padd)}
<D>__{i can see you have a good heart.}
<A>__{soran taps a control on the padd. suddenly geordi grabs his chest in pain. soran watches geordi for a few seconds, then taps the padd again. geordi gasps and starts to breathe.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{oh... i forgot to tell you. while you were unconscious, i injected a nano probe into your bloodstream. it's been navigating your cardiovascular system... and right now i've attached it to your left ventricle.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{a little trick i picked up from the borg.}
<C>__{geordi}
<P>__{(gasping)}
<D>__{yeah... they're full of great ideas.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{i just stopped your heart for five seconds. it felt like an eternity, didn't it? did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{no... i didn't know that...}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{we learn something new about ourselves every day.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now. maybe i didn't make myself clear. it is very important that you tell me exactly what captain picard knows.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{i told you everything... you might as well just kill me right now...}
<A>__{soran's features soften as he smiles slightly. for a moment, he looks genuinely compassionate and it's a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{i'm not a killer, mr. la forge.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{let's try thirty seconds.}
<A>__{soran taps a control on the padd. geordi gasps and strains against an unimaginable pain. soran picks up his pocket watch and opens the cover... sits back in his chair, watching the seconds tick away...}
