<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. for whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but i am among you as he that serveth.}

<C>__{winslow}
<D>__{from where did you thieve this?}
