<A>__{sliding into a heavy ordnance rack with an echoing clang. pull back as the rack of tactical missiles is lifted, revealing two powerful hydraulic arms. spunkmeyer, seated inside a power loader, swings the ordnance up into a belly nacelle of the drop ship where it locks into place. as he exerts pressure with his hands against the servo controls the hydraulic arms move correspondingly...but with a thousandfold increase in power. the forklift style claws on each arm can crush with tons of pressure. the loader has an open roll cage to protect the operator, and is supported by squat hydraulic legs which also move correspondingly with the driver's movements. you have never seen anything like this before. advanced as it is to us, it's only an old forklift to them...battered and well used. covered with grease. repainted many times. across the back is stencilled "caterpillar." spunkmeyer's machine swings out from under the drop ship and we become aware of the intense activity throughout the cavernous loading bay. troopers on foot or driving tow mowers, overhead loading arms...all in motion. hicks checks off items on an electronic manifest.}
