<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{irv's wife rosalyn sits up on the bed in a muumuu, half her face is burned.}
<C>__{rosalyn rosenfeld}
<D>__{i put out the fire. the fire is out.}
<C>__{irving rosenfeld}
<D>__{for the first time in my life i do the right thing.}
<C>__{rosalyn rosenfeld}
<D>__{oh shut up }
<C>__{irving rosenfeld}
<D>__{i save a young single mother, and her kid. i marry her. i adopt him }
<C>__{rosalyn rosenfeld}
<D>__{you fell in love! don't forget we fell madly in love!}
<C>__{irving rosenfeld}
<D>__{yes, i fell in love. my god, i fell in love. yes. but you know what? i thought you were mysterious like my mother until it turned out that mysterious just meant depressed, hard to reach. i mean, i'm dying here! and you need somebody who's gonna be quiet like you. you're young, you're beautiful. you gotta find somebody else. you gotta go out and get some friends all right? don't sit inside }
<C>__{rosalyn rosenfeld}
<D>__{i don't like going out. you know that i get anxiety when i have to meet people. you know how hard that is.}
<C>__{irving rosenfeld}
<D>__{yeah but you can't just stay in the house with the fucking sun lamp. alright? and i can't i mean, look, i can't trust you with it anyway. that fire and everything. i can't trust to leave you with danny.}
<C>__{rosalyn rosenfeld}
<D>__{i put the fire out irving! there is no fire! maybe if you were here more, then there wouldn't have been a fire in the first place.}
<C>__{irving rosenfeld}
<D>__{oh, what, there wouldn't have been a fire if i was here?}
<C>__{rosalyn rosenfeld}
<D>__{just stop with the whole fire thing. god it was a mistake. i'm sure a million people do that all the time. those sun lamps are dangerous. shouldn't even have them in the house, really. i bet that happens all the time. this was nothing.}
<C>__{irving rosenfeld}
<D>__{we're not happy. alright?}
<A>__{rosalyn just stares there for a moment at irving saying nothing.}
<C>__{rosalyn rosenfeld}
<D>__{you know that i could take danny. you know that most of your work is illegal. and you know that if you tried to divorce me, you know that i'm not saying that i would, but i'm saying that i could. and i'm saying that that is why i don't like divorce, irving. women do that in divorces. women get the children, and then the fathers never see them. my mother never got divorced. my grandmother never got divorced. there are no divorces in my family. i am not getting a divorce.}
<C>__{irving rosenfeld}
<D>__{come on. what are we doing here?}
<C>__{rosalyn rosenfeld}
<D>__{we fight and we fuck and that's what we do. that's our thing.}
<C>__{irving rosenfeld }
<D>__{she was the piccaso of passive aggressive karate. she was better than any con artist i'd ever met including myself. and she had me like nobody had me.}
<A>__{rosalyn sheds her muumuu, to reveal a white leotard.}
<C>__{rosalyn rosenfeld}
<D>__{irving, come to mama. come on.}
<C>__{irving rosenfeld }
<D>__{you might say she was my karma for how i took advantage of people.}
<C>__{rosalyn rosenfeld}
<D>__{irving, come here. come on. get into bed.}
<C>__{irving rosenfeld}
<D>__{alright.}
<C>__{rosalyn rosenfeld}
<D>__{baby, there's such good stuff here.}
