<C>__{sandy's voice}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{osbourne}
<D>__{sandy?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{osbourne}
<D>__{hi, it's osbourne cox, how are you. hi.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{... hi.}
<C>__{osbourne}
<D>__{hi. sorry to call out of the blue but i have a, well, a publishing question and i thought you might be the person to ask, i have this manuscript, something to do with my professional experiences, not to go into too much detail but i think it's pretty explosive stuff and i think that it could merit a fairly wide readership handled properly and it isn't quite finished yet but there's a situation where i'm worried about it leaking now and maybe excerpts being published or on the internet, whatever, without my permission, and a lot of the impact being, um, blunted, so i'm actually anxious to bring it to market sooner than i'd planned i mean, like now, in fact so i was thinking, i know you, and you seem to do well, so i was wondering if you were happy with your publisher. the people you use.}
<A>__{a long beat.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{you've written a children's book?}
<C>__{osbourne}
<D>__{no! no no, a, a kind of a memoir, but doesn't your company have an adult arm? or isn't it, uh, the children's arm? of a regular publisher?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{pappas & swain do children's literature.}
<C>__{osbourne}
