<L>__{interior control booth night}
<A>__{from behind a glass partition, carlson works at her console. a monitor counts away the seconds. 59, 58, 57... in the darkened lab, kate, dressed in early 1920s attire, straps herself in and smiles tearfully. their voices echo in the lab.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i know. me too.}
<A>__{they embrace each other for the last time.}

<A>__{he puts his finger to her lips. he looks to his wife then back at kate. he nods his head.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{go.}
<A>__{they force themselves to smile, trying to get through the moment.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{ready!}
<A>__{charlie, leo and his new bride stand back. inside the craft, the only light comes from the glowing red lever. carlson raises her arm, signaling kate. then to her staff:}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{9, 8, 7...}
<A>__{kate presses her hand against the glass as a final goodbye. she grabs the lever with her other hand and turns away, staring straight ahead. charlie puts his arm around leo.}
<C>__{carlson}
<D>__{3, 2, 1!}
<A>__{there is a bright white flash. kate is gone. the others stand there motionless, stunned. the screen is black.}
