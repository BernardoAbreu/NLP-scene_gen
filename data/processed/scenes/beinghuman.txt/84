<A>__{beatrice and hector descend back in the room. a boy of about eight and a girl of ten are coming in from the garden. they have been working outside. beatrice goes to embrace each of them. hector's face is a confusion once again.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{you were gone a long time. who's this?}
<A>__{the girl eyes hector up and down.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{this is hector.}
<A>__{beatrice pronounces his name with care. she stands proudly by her children.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{these are my children...}
<A>__{the creak of a door makes hector turn his head.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{... and this is my mother....}
<A>__{an old woman stands in the main doorway, smiling at hector and nodding her head. she speaks to her daughter.}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{so... you found one, eh?}
<A>__{hector stands, surrounded by instant family, and doesn't know what to do. eventually he speaks.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{is there water... to drink... to wash?}
<A>__{he mimes with his hands. beatrice understands that he wants some breathing space. she talks to her son.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{take hector to the well... but come here first.}
<A>__{she takes off the dead squire's shoes and puts them on the boy's bare feet. he is delighted. he does a little dance in them before leaving with hector.}
