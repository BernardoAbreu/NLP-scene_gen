<L>__{interior farmhouse kitchen day}
<A>__{the remains of pie and coffee on the table, charlie and wesley kick back with jerrold blaine and his wife elizabeth, both in their 80's. photos of betty at various ages lie scattered in front of them. charlie holds up a picture of a young betty in ballerina costume posing at the barre. he studies it intently.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{this is betty at twelve.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{very graceful. perfect form.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{betty was a lovely child.}
<C>__{jerrold}
<D>__{and she always had such spirit! but, after her mother died...}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{would you say she was ambitious?}
<C>__{jerrold}
<D>__{oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.}
<A>__{charlie admires a photo of betty, around 18 years old. he continues to rummage through a box of collectibles, pocketing a small child's diary when it is convenient.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{wise beyond her years, i'm sure, and such poise, too.}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{very, very impressive...}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone i can tell you she put up with things in that marriage i wouldn't have. and yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. and that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{if anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(taking her hand)}
<D>__{mrs. blaine? i can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill del sizemore.}
<C>__{jerrold}
<D>__{you've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. that's not our betty...}
<C>__{wesley}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{... why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?}
<C>__{jerrold}
<D>__{because it ain't natural, young man.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{what are you talking about? killing's totally natural. it's dying that isn't natural...}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(covering)}
<D>__{my partner's still young, mr. blaine, and he loves his job.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{he'd like to kill all the criminals himself!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now, if betty was running from someone, where do you think she'd go?}
