<L>__{exterior ocean day}
<A>__{we are jetting low and impossibly fast across whitecapped azure water, toward crumbled ruins of a long abandoned village on an empty beach we remember it vividly from marco's memory arriving to slowly spin and hover over the remnants of an ancient caravansary:}

<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{we know that.}
<A>__{marco looks past her, to the water, which stretches out from here, as if to forever.}

<A>__{marco approaches the water's edge, staring out at the uncertain horizon. nothing but water as far as the eye can see. pull back. and back. and back ...}
