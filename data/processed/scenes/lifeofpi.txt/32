<A>__{the speaker on top of the mosque plays the muslim call to prayer.}
<L>__{interior pi family home, 1973 day}
<A>__{pi is out in front of the house kneeling on a prayer mat, repeating a prayer. father passes by with friends. he stops to watch pi.}
<L>__{interior family kitchen dining room, 1973 dusk}
<A>__{father sits at the dinner table with his family. the servant offers a dish of lamb to father only. father pops a bite into his mouth, savoring it.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{this lamb is exquisite it's best dish on the table. you are all missing out...}
<A>__{as he chews, father notices pi completing a blessing.}
<C>__{father }
<D>__{you only need to convert to three more religions, piscine, and you will spend your life on holiday.}
<C>__{ravi}
<P>__{(laughing:)}
<D>__{are you going to mecca this year, swami jesus? or to rome, for your coronation as pope pi us?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{you stay out of this, ravi. just as you like cricket, pi has his own interests.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{no gita, ravi has a point, no? you cannot follow three different religions at the same time, piscine.}
<C>__{pi}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{because believing in everything at the same time is the same as not believing in anything at all.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{he's young santosh he's still finding his way.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{and how can he find his way if he does not choose a path?}
<P>__{(to pi:)}
<D>__{listen: instead of leaping from one religion to the next, why not start with reason? in a few hundred years, science has taken us farther in understanding the universe than religion has in ten thousand.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{that is true. your father is right. science can teach us more about what's out there }
<P>__{(with a hand to her heart:)}
<D>__{ but not what is in here. art, music, literature they all spring from our faith.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{some eat meat, some eat vegetable. i do not expect us all to agree about everything. but i would much rather have you believe in something i don't agree with than to accept everything blindly. and that begins with thinking rationally. do you understand?}
<A>__{pi nods.}
<C>__{father }
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{pi}
<D>__{i would like to be baptized.}
<A>__{father and mother react. ravi stifles a laugh.}
