<L>__{interior waiting room angle on door day}
<A>__{we're in a dentist's office. christine is waiting for a beat before the door opens, and dr. john montgomery emerges.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{dr. montgomery}
<D>__{he had two cavities that needed filling. he put up a fight, but i took care of it.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{and...?}
<A>__{he casts a look back at the closed door, shakes his head. changeling a true story}
<C>__{dr. montgomery}
<D>__{your son's upper front teeth were separated by a small muscle. made them sit about an eighth of an inch apart. the boy in that room has no such gap.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{does a gap like that get smaller with age? because that's what they'll say.}
<C>__{dr. montgomery}
<D>__{in some cases, yes, it's possible. but the muscle between walter's teeth prevents that from happening. they can never come together without an operation to sever the muscle, and i can tell you right now that he has never had such an operation.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{will you be willing to sign a letter saying that officially?}
<C>__{dr. montgomery}
<D>__{pardon my language, but...hell, yes.}
<A>__{he hears an os moan from the inner office.}
<C>__{dr. montgomery}
<D>__{sounds like the anesthetic is wearing off.}
<P>__{(starts in, pauses)}
<D>__{on the other hand, maybe i will write that letter first. give the little fella something to think about.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
