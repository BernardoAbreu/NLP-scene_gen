<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{can i pull a chair out for you?}
<A>__{neff looks around. he sees a man sitting in the corner smoking a hand rolled cigarette. he is about fifty five years old, with white hair, and a broad brimmed stetson hat. he looks like a small town lawyer or maybe a mining man. neff does not like the man's presence there very much. he turns to him just enough to answer.}

<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{car nine, section eleven. a pleasure.}
<A>__{he rises and exits into the parlor car. neff turns slowly and watches jackson go back through the car. then he moves to one side of the platform and looks ahead along the track to orientate himself. he gives one last glance back into the parlor car to make sure no one is watching him. he slips the crutches from under his arms and stands on both feet. he drops the crutches off the train onto the tracks, then quickly swings his body over the rail. b 59 exterior moving observation car camera following neff is hanging onto the railing. he looks down, then lets go and drops to the right of way. the camera stops. the train recedes slowly into the night. neff has fallen on the tracks. he picks himself up, rubs one knee and looks back along the line of the tracks and off to one side. b 60 dark landscape railroad tracks close beyond the edge of the right of way, the silhouette of a dump shows up. beside it looms the dark bulk of the dietrichson sedan. the headlights blink twice and go out. b 61 neff he starts running towards the car. he runs a little awkwardly because of the improvised cast on his left foot. b 62 car in the dark the front door opens and phyllis steps out. she closes the door and looks in the direction of the tracks. the uneven steps of neff running towards her are heard. she opens the back door of the car and leans in. she pulls the rug off the corpse (which is not visible) and stands looking into the car, unable to take her eyes off what she sees, while at the same time her hands mechanically begin to fold the rug. the running steps grow louder and neff comes into the shot breathing hard. he reaches her.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{okay. this has to go fast. take his hat and pick up the crutches.}
<A>__{neff points back towards the tracks. he reaches into the car and begins to drag out the body by the armpits. phyllis coolly reaches past him and takes the hat off the dead man's head. she turns to go.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{hang on to that rug. i will need it.}
<A>__{phyllis moves out of the shot carrying the hat and rug. b 63 neff he gets a stronger hold on the dead dietrichson and drags him free of the car and towards the tracks. the corpse is not seen. b 64 phyllis she has reached the point where one of the crutches lies. she picks it up and goes for the other crutch a short distance away. she carries both crutches, the hat and the rug towards neff. b 65 neff he has reached the railroad tracks. the corpse is lying beside the tracks, face down. phyllis comes up to neff. he takes the crutches and the hat from her. he throws the crutches beside the corpse. he takes the hat from phyllis and tosses it carelessly along the track.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{let's go. stay behind me.}
<A>__{he takes the rug from her and they move back towards the car, phyllis first, then neff walking almost backwards, sweeping the ground over which the body was dragged with the rug as they go. b 66 the car they reach it together.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{get in. you drive.}
<A>__{she gets in. neff sweeps the ground after him as he goes around the car to get in beside her. he throws the rug into the back of the car. b 67 interior car phyllis is behind the wheel. neff beside her is just closing the door. he props his wrapped foot against the dashboard and begins to tear off the adhesive tape while at the same time phyllis presses the starter button. the starter grinds, but the motor doesn't catch. she tries again. it still doesn't catch. neff looks at her. she tries a third time. the starter barely turns over. the battery is very low. phyllis leans back. they stare at each other desperately. after a moment neff bends forward slowly and turns the ignition key to the off position. he holds his left thumb poised over the starter button. there is a breathless moment. then he presses the starter button with swift decision. the starter grinds with nerve wracking sluggishness. neff twists the ignition key to on and instantly pulls the hand throttle wide open. with a last feeble kick of the starter, the motor catches and races. he eases the throttle down and slides back into his place. they look at each other again. the tenseness of the moment still shows in their faces.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{let's go, baby.}
<A>__{phyllis releases the hand brake and puts the car in reverse. neff is again busy unwrapping the tape from his leg. the car moves. b 68 dark landscape with dump the car, with the headlights out, backs up, swings around and moves off along the dirt road the way it came.}
