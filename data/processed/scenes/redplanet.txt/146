<L>__{exterior cosmos site night}
<A>__{gallagher sits there. and sits there. alone beyond imagining. hope gone. just staring 1000 yards out into the distance. not looking at anything. waiting to die. he's given up. and then...he shakes himself out of it. just feels foolish he's let himself go this far. gets up. done with feeling sorry for himself.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{well, this can't get any worse. i guess.}
<A>__{grabs himself to stay warm. hops up and down. on one of the hops he ends up facing the direction he came from. there's something green and phosphorescent coming over the ridge. they've tracked him. footprint by footprinterior he looks closer. it's not just the ridge. they're down in the valley with him. the ones in the front are back to translucent, not glowing anymore. they're hungry for something new. he gets down low to silhouette them against the sky. there are already four or five hundred thousand on this side of the hill. and they're coming. faster.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i guess i was wrong. it can get worse. a lot fucking worse.}
<P>__{(shouts at them)}
<D>__{forgive me if i don't feel like getting eaten before i die!}
<A>__{they don't really respond. except the ones in the front who rear up, and seem to listen or sniff for him. and gnash their little crystalline teeth. they split now to come at him from two sides. gallagher gets caught in a dry heave.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{oh, man...}
<A>__{sees the bucket of rocket fuel. lot closer to them than it is to him. gathers his nerve, runs, grabs the bucket. drags it twenty feet back. then tilts it, carefully pouring it out in a ring around himself and the cosmos. worms closing in as he goes. leads a fuse of fuel back towards him. lights it. it burns low and yellow in the oxygen depleted atmosphere. doesn't look like much. certainly not a defence. first worm gets near it. unsure. bewildered. pulls back. but his compatriots are behind him, still coming. no choice. he advances. and...poof. vaporizes in burst of red orange as he touches the flame. and the nexterior..and the nexterior like little sparks. gallagher watches, puzzled by this...and then it hits. right as the ring of flame is about to die out. the main wave touches the ring of fire. and...they do burn. and scream. little worm screams that multiplied by tens and hundreds of thousands begin to pierce the air.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{that's for eating the hab! and killing cooper, you slimy worm fuckers!}
<A>__{rolling waves of flame. half plasma. flying blobs of burning worms rain down like napalm. one lands on and torches the cobbled together radio. it's so damn hot for a moment gallagher panics, thinking everything might explode. then it drops to embers and the wave burns over the hill like a wild fire. gallagher does a dance of triumph. however short lived. then it hits him }
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{how do you burn like that without oxygen??}
<A>__{there's a blast of flame from the far side of the ridge that rattles rocks and cosmos. knocks him to the ground.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{holy shit...holy shit!}
<A>__{gallagher stares with wonder over the hill. he figured it out. there's a couple of dozen worms, unburnt and thrown free. he picks one up, looks at it.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{you motherfuckers stole all the oxygen.}
<P>__{(realizes)}
<D>__{and you can give it back. motherfuckers. i gotta tell someone. it could work. it could work here...}
<A>__{he turns, looks the radio is still burning. he snatches it up, scorches him. tries to put it out. it's cooked. deceased. he's devastated. drops to his knees.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{no!! not after all this. no!!!}
<A>__{it ain't gonna work ever again. all the shouting isn't gonna make a difference. he knows the answer, he knows how to save the species and there's no one he can tell. as he stumbles back onto his feet, he's jarred the switch that links to amee's display. it comes on, shows: amee's pov the fire on the far side of the ridge. she's approaching it. and fast.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{gallagher stares at it for a moment...}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{my day is not getting better, is it.}
<A>__{there's a look on his face somewhere between inspiration and fear. like he's got an idea. but it might be a really, really bad one...}
