<A>__{laser walks with clay. clay sports a homemade arm cast for the skateboard mishap we witnessed earlier.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{that jump was cake, dude! i so could've made it.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{you were like 20 feet short, dude! there was no way.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{yeah, well if paul wasn't there i could have landed it. that guy creeps me out.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{whatever.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{he's kind of a fag, dude. tryin' to act all like your dad and shit.}
<A>__{laser doesn't know how to respond so he ignores the comment. a stray dog comes up to them. laser stops to pet it.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{hey buddy. good boy.}
<A>__{laser sees the dog has no tags. he looks around for an owner. the dog nuzzles laser for affection.}
<C>__{laser }
<D>__{i've seen this dog around. i wonder if he's lost.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{let's pee on his head.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{clay unzips his fly. it's difficult with the plaster cast.}
<C>__{laser }
<D>__{dude, don't do that.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{come on. hold him...}
<A>__{clay yanks the dog by his scruff.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{dude, quit it!}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(mocking)}
<D>__{duuude, quit it!}
<A>__{suddenly, laser gets it. his friend is the tool. he grabs the dog and smacks him to get him to run away.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{go! run! get out of here!}
<A>__{the dog takes off. clay shoves laser.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{why are you such a fag?!}
<A>__{laser shoves clay back hard.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{why are you such a dick?!}
<A>__{clay hits laser in the mouth. laser touches his lip. sees blood, and walks away. friendship over.}
