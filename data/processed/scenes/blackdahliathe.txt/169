<A>__{bucky rings the doorbell. fritz vogel answers.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{boyo! glad you could make it.}
<A>__{he claps bucky on the shoulder and leads him into the house.}
<L>__{interior fritz vogel's living room continuous}
<A>__{the interior decorating equivalent of highballs and pretzels, which is exactly what vogel, bucky and ellis loew are consuming. bucky drinks with the trepidation of the king's food taster.}
<C>__{ellis loew}
<D>__{i called this little meeting for a couple reasons, bucky. we'd both like to see the short case closed out and get back to normal business.}
<A>__{bucky looks impatient and ellis senses this.}
<C>__{ellis loew }
<D>__{we're both comers, bucky. fritzie wants you for his partner when he gets his lieutenancy, and }
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{russ millard wants me when harry retires.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{you're too raw for him, boyo. old russ is a sob sister, and i'm much more your type.}
<A>__{bucky considers the truth in this. to loew:}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{what do you want, ellis?}
<C>__{ellis loew}
<D>__{very well, dwight. i will tell you. there are four confessors still being held at city jail. they've got no alibis, weren't coherent when they were first questioned, and they're all violent, frothing at the mouth lunatics. i want them reintegrated. it's a muscle job.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{i wanted bill koenig }
<C>__{ellis loew}
<D>__{but bill's a bit too enamored with violence. so it's you, dwight. yes or no? because if it's yes, i will make sure you're back on warrants tomorrow with an inside track to some stripes. if not, it's homicide shitwork until russ millard gets tired of you. we both know that russ is a patient, forbearing man, dwight. that could be a long time. yes or no?}
