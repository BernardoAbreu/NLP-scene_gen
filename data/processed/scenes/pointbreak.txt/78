<L>__{exterior latigo beach night}
<A>__{six dark figures walk toward us out of shafts of light... the headlights of bodhi's chevy 4wd and tyler's porsche. the figures are bodhi, johnny, tyler and the other surfers. rosie hangs back with the idling vehicles, tattooed arms crossed. he puffs on a cigarette. a wide shot (matte) of the beach shows a pool of light from the headlights, beyond it a vast silver ocean under a black sky. the full moon casts the world in cold monochrome. the little figures reach the sea.}

<P>__{(a voice in the distance)}
<D>__{gaping barrels! way overhead, man!}
<A>__{closer, as moonlit figures run into the water. utah stands on the beach, hoping his eyes will adjust.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{i can barely do this in broad daylight.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{come on. at least no one's gonna see how bad you are.}
<A>__{johnny clenches his jaw and charges past her into the water. he strokes powerfully out through the black swell. utah's ebony board pierces the wave and he slides down the backside to where the others are waiting. roach and nathaniel, silhouettes nearby, see one they like and take off yelling. johnny turns as a figure glides up next to him.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{i gotta be fucking crazy.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{yeah, but are you crazy enough?}
<A>__{grommet gets a ride, slicing across in front of them. a ghost moving off into the silvery distance. tyler waves jauntily and takes the next one. it's johnny's turn.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{football's a man made game. you keep score with numbers. but in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent. just you and the wave.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{i know that part. tell me something i can use, here.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{i've watched you once or twice. you surf like it's some kind of street fight. you jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you. always trying to win.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{a flaw i'm working on.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{the only way to win out here is to surrender. you have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync. just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{yeah, right, vision is highly over rated.}
<A>__{bodhi is looking at the lights along the shoreline. without looking back, he senses the incoming swell.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{this one's got your name on it, johnny.}
<A>__{utah looks. huge glassy face, perfectly formed. black and terrifying.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{bodhi digs in with both hands, driving himself forward. johnny starts grabbing water right behind him. the wave picks them up.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{shit, i'm gonna die. i'm gonna die now.}
<A>__{johnny uses the patented tyler pop and makes it to his feet. suddenly he's going like a shot. he moves back on the board, trims out, slowing down. maintains a fragile control. on pure adrenalized instinct, heart pounding, he falls in behind bodhi, taking the same line along the roaring black face. bodhi is like the silver surfer, ahead of him in the moonlight. not wanting to drop too far behind, johnny walks a little forward on the board. the nose dips, picking up speed. johnny starts letting the speed work for him, learning that he can make long floating turns up and down the glassy face. feeling the water under his feet, the tons of water piling up behind him... feeling its awesome power and borrowing a little of it. the silver surfer and the quarterback rocket through the night. utah has a big feral grin plastered on his face. bodhi looks back. gives him a thumbs up. then he cuts left and drops giddily down to the bottom, slashing back and climbing. utah tries it, feels the drop like freefall... feels the speed. he makes his bottom turn, nearly falling. the grin dropping off his face. he falls in behind bodhi again as the wave wraps over them like a great black wing. tyler, paddling back out, watches them shoot past her. utah raises his arms above his head and howls like a gonzo wolf as they go by. she grins to herself, watching him. knows he's gotten the ride that will make him a surfer for life.}
