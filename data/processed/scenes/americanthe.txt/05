<L>__{exterior lakeside morning}
<A>__{they continue through the woods until they reach the shoreline of the lake. ingrid steps onto the ice. holds out her hand. a beat. jack takes ingrid's hand. solid as stone, the frozen lake takes his weight. they walk out, ingrid slipping and laughing. the landscape is magical. jack begins to relax, slipping and swearing. suddenly, he stops. there are footprints in the thin snow going out across the lake.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{snow hare.}
<A>__{beside the snow hare's prints are those of a man.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{a hunter?}
<A>__{jack studies the two sets of tracks. those of the snow hare are heading out into the lake. the man's prints are heading in the opposite direction, towards the shoreline. jack spins around in the direction they've just come from. no one. then, about ten metres inland from the edge of the lake, a low branch dips and a thick rug of snow falls from the branch. jack grabs ingrid, yanks her towards the cover of the lakeside trees and pushes her down into the snow. she grunts, winded. he lies besides her. we hear the crack of a bullet so quiet it might be a bough snapping under the weight of winter. it isn't. jack pulls a walther ppk s semi automatic handgun from the pocket of his parka. cocks it. waits. then bobs up and down once. there's another crack from the trees. jack pinpoints the spot from the drift of blue smoke, almost invisible in the winter air. there's someone in the shadows. he rubs snow into his woollen hat, edges up until he can just see over the snow and pumps three shots into the dusk under the trees. we hear a muttering groan and then a sliding sound, as if jack has just shot a tobogganist. more snow slides off the trees. jack waits. ingrid gathers her breath but loses her wits:}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{you have a gun.}
<A>__{jack keeps his eyes fixed on the trees.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{you have a gun! how do you have a gun? why should you carry such a weapon?}
<A>__{jack looks at her briefly but makes no reply. she is busy thinking. so is he.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{jack?}
<A>__{he stands up slowly and walks inland towards the corpse that is just visible now in the shadows beneath the trees. ingrid follows, frightened. the man is slouched forwards in a drift of snow, his body cushioned in white softness. jack kicks the sole of his boot. he's dead.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{jack talk to me!}
<A>__{jack grabs his collar and turns him over. he doesn't recognise him. jack fumbles at his buttons and rummages in his clothing. in his breast pocket he finds a military identity pass.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{who is he?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{a hunter.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{he's not dressed like a hunter. why is he alone? hunters always go in pairs. for safety.}
<A>__{swiftly, jack removes the bolt from the man's rifle and throws it far into the trees.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{go for help. call the police.}
<A>__{ingrid sets off, stumbling up the track they have made through the snow. jack shoots her just once, in the nape of her neck. she twitches in the snow, her blood staining the white fur of her coat collar. from a distance, ingrid looks like a shot snow hair. jack approaches her. and steps over her, trying not to look down. trying not to look back.}
