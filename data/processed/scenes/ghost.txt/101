<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm saving you, oda mae. you'll go to heaven for this.}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{write "st. joseph's shelter".}
<A>__{with great hesitation, oda mae begins to write. we sense that every word is a torment for her. the nuns politely avert their eyes from the check.}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{bless you, child.}
<A>__{oda mae gives her a dirty look and hands the check over.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm proud of you.}

<D>__{friends? friends?}
<A>__{she turns on her high heels and wobbles away. sam calls after her.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i think you're wonderful, oda mae.}
<A>__{she growls again. in the background we see the nuns secretly peeking at the check. one of them, wide eyed, faints dead away. the other nun stoops down and fans her face in an attempt to revive her.}
