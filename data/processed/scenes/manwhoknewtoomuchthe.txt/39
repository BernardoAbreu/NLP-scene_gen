<A>__{hank rubs his backside a little.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{next time take the train.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(to louis)}
<D>__{would you like to share our taxi to the hotel?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{that's kind of you, doctor, but unfortunately i have some business first.}
<A>__{jo tries to be casual.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{what business are you in, mr. bernard?}
<A>__{but he has turned his head and speaks something in arabic to a porter, who begins to gather the mckenna's bags, and one belonging to louis. louis turns to ben.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{however, i will be there later perhaps we might have a drink together.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{all right. but i will serve the drinks in our suite.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{in that case, i will take you to dinner.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no. now that's not a fair bargain.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{but i know marrakesh. i can show you an intriguing arab restaurant where the food is different, and the manner of eating exotic.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(gives in)}
<D>__{well that's what we came here for. okay, jo? simple one of those arabian nights?}
<A>__{ben takes her arm, in a warm gesture.}
<C>__{jo}
<P>__{(smiles agreeably)}
<D>__{okay, but i'm no scheherazade.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you'll do.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{how would you prefer to travel to the hotel? by taxi? fiacre?}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{a wagon! i want to ride in a wagon!}
<A>__{he points out one of the open horse drawn carriages. louis looks to ben for confirmation. ben nods assent. louis turns to the porter, and orders him in arabia to put the mckenna's baggage aboard the first available carriage. he picks up his own small bag.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{au revoir. i look forward to cocktails.}
<A>__{he nods to ben and jo, and pats hank on the head.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{see you later. and thinks again.}
<A>__{louis smiles, turns and casually strolls off toward the center of the market place. hank watches him for a moment, while ben turns to see what is happening to his bags.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{i don't like people who pat me on the head.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(turns to jo)}
<D>__{the carriage awaits, madame.}
<A>__{jo turns from the retreating louis, and steers hank toward ben, the camera pans them to the fiacre.}
