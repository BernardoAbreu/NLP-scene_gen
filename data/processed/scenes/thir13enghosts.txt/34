<D>__{you could say that.}
<A>__{arthur's attention is now drawn to the rare collection of books piled up against the walls. we pan, following arthur, discovering a pair of ghost glasses on a shelf.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{this is incredible, chaucer, dickens, hemingway... these are all first editions.}
<A>__{arthur carefully handles the books.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{your uncle was quite a collector. of many things.}
<A>__{ben removes a folder of papers from his briefcase. lays them across the desk. hands arthur a pen. arthur reluctantly pulls himself away from collection.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i've highlighted where you're supposed to sign.}
<P>__{(indicating)}
<D>__{first here }
<A>__{arthur takes the pen from him, pauses.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{look, i didn't want to bring this up in front of the kids. this place... it's amazing, and we're extremely grateful, believe me, but i don't know how we can afford it... i'm just a teacher... and the taxes on it must be... well, to be honest...}
<P>__{(long beat, almost to himself)}
<D>__{... a fire took away everything we had...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{not to worry, arthur, your uncle was a genius with finances. he took care of everything. estate taxes. inheritance taxes, you name it. you'll never have to worry about money ever again.}

<C>__{rafkin }
<D>__{arthur!!}
<A>__{arthur looks up and sees rafkin standing in the doorway, looking horrible, out of breath, trying like hell to shed the vomit stained power & light jumpsuit he's been wearing.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(panicked, rambling)}
<D>__{we gotta talk.}
<A>__{arthur looks with panic at ben.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what the hell's wrong with the breakers?}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{my name's dennis rafkin, and i }

<D>__{my office warned me about this guy.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(an urgency in his voice)}
<D>__{you gotta listen to me... this is gonna be hard to swallow... but i used to hunt displaced spiritual energy... with your uncle.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{... p.k. agents, revenants, eidolons, umbras, wraiths... any of this ring a bell?}
<A>__{arthur looks back and forth from the lawyer to the vomit stained psychic, thoroughly confused. rafkin takes a beat.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{alright, let's do this the easy way. ghosts, arthur. i used to hunt ghosts with your uncle cyrus and }
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{ghosts??}
<A>__{ben starts laughing, more loudly than is appropriate.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(rolling his eyes, stating the obvious)}
<D>__{disgruntled souls trapped on earth because of unfinished business, yes.}
<P>__{(to arthur)}
<D>__{listen, you gotta get your kids and get the hell out of here, now.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{this is one for the books. i never met a real live lunatic before.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{hey, asshole, i'm not talking to you. you can stay in here as long as you want.}
<P>__{(to arthur)}
<D>__{i know it sounds crazy, but this is serious. the basement is filled with containment cubes. if i were you }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{arthur, this guy's been calling my office since your uncle died. i see it all the time. some rich guy passes away, and then all the nuts come out. next thing you know, he'll be claiming cyrus owed him money.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{you're damn right he did. it's bad enough i had to, um talk your secretary into telling me where you'd be so i could get paid oh, by the way, she genuinely thinks you're a real bucket of shit }
<P>__{(to arthur)}
<D>__{but i don't give a damn about that. all i care about is getting my ass outta here. i suggest you do the same.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{look, i don't know what's going on, but }

<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what's the matter? you alright?}
<A>__{he finds a bottle of pain relievers in his pocket, tries to get it open, but his fingers are trembling in pain.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{goddamn childproof caps...}
<A>__{rafkin fumbles with the bottle. arthur reaches out to give him a hand. when he makes contact, rafkin receives a series of flashes: flashback arthur's previous dream jean's in front of the sliding glass doors, with the kids outside playing. the images begin to blur and pound forward with amazing speed, then }
<B>__{end of flashback. back to library}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{hey, buddy. you okay?}
<A>__{rafkin looks around, registering where he is. on the floor.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{yeah, shit, my head...}
<A>__{arthur reaches out to help him up. rafkin recoils.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{don't. touch me.}
