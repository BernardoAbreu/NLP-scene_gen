<L>__{interior office library, lorenson's home, night}
<A>__{eugene sits opposite lorenson, who quietly observes him, jotting some notes down on her pad. she is intermittently holding up pictures for eugene, asking him to repeat their names as if she were teaching him to read.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{eugene, this is a "train."}
<A>__{eugene starts to pronounce the word when abruptly, and without any warning, he looks like he's unconscious, only with a blank stare. lorenson quickly moves beside eugene and watches him from up close, apparently not altogether surprised at what's happening. eugene doesn't even blink. the only sounds we hear from him are a couple, barely audible guttural noises. lorenson exhausted takes off her glasses wearily and gently addresses the boy.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{come on back down here. wherever you are...try to come on back. you'll like it, i promise.}
<A>__{just then, talia walks in with tea, juice and cookies for eugene and lorenson. she spots her son in his absent, staring state and forces her face into a small, sad smile to avoid tears as she sets the tray down and the cookies before them. talia gently touches lorenson's hand. lorenson looks at her warmly. talia knows how hard she's trying.}
