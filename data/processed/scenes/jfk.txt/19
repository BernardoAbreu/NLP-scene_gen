<A>__{swald's apartment on a different day in 1963. george de mohrenschildt points out a mannlicher carcano rifle in the closet, turns to lee.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{so, lee, what are you taking a potshot at this week rabbits or fascists?}
<A>__{lee's look is sickly. he freezes up. resume scene of white russian gathering in oswald's apartment.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{the only russian that suspects oswald of still being a communist is anna meller. but her russian friend tells her "he's checked" with the local fbi and was told oswald is all right.}
<A>__{anna meller, one of the guests, glances at a copy of das kapital in a pile of books, and talks to another russian man about it... talking now to lee and marina are janet and bill williams, a mid american couple in their late twenties, freshly minted.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{the oswalds are introduced by george de mohrenschildt to janet and bill williams. it's through janet williams in october '63 that lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on elm street at the book depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.}
<A>__{we see oswald and another man in the texas school book depository in 1963. they are hauling and stacking school textbooks an obviously lower level job for oswald after the map factory. we cut ahead to empty graphics of the sealed off area, the window site, the cafeteria.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{all i can find out about the williams' is their tax returns are classified and that bill williams, a descendant of the cabots of massachusetts, has links through his family and united fruit to the cia and does classified work for bell helicopter which requires a security clearance so what is oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? williams has a relationship at bell with general walter dornberger, another one of the nazis we brought in after the war for our missile program. he used slave labor to build the v 2 rockets for hitler before bell needed him.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i wonder about the williams'. just where did the first description of oswald come from at 12:44? no one knows. they claimed it was brennan's, but his description came after 1 p.m. who called? somehow the fbi's been tapping the williams' and picks up a call between bell helicopter and janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "we both know who's responsible." who called? why's the bureau been tapping them?}
<A>__{we see the interior of the williams' home in irving on a day in 1963.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{his wife, janet williams, studied russian in college and her father worked for the agency for international development, which works hand in hand with the cia. she suddenly becomes marina's best friend. marina fights often with lee about many things his secrecy, the lack of money. she says lee is not sexually adequate. lee hits her on several occasions. bill williams' convenient separation from janet allows janet to invite marina to move into her house in irving. there marina and lee have a second daughter while lee, now 24, stores his belongings in janet's garage and rents a small room in dallas under an alias of "o.h. lee".}
<A>__{we see marina and oswald in bed at night in the williams' house, in a tender scene. oswald says goodbye to his child.}
