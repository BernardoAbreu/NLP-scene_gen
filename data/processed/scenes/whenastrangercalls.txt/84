<A>__{tracy goes up to the closet with her coat. the door is closed. she opens it. she hangs up her coat and closes the door again. then she turns and starts walking out of the hallway to the living room. as she is rounding the corner into the living room, she walks right into duncan. she barely has time to gasp before he clamps his hand over her mouth and pushes her against the wall.}

<A>__{as she isn't struggling, he starts to loosen up on her.}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{he takes his hand away from her mouth, lets go of her, and slowly, cautiously steps back. tracy looks at him for a breathless moment, her eyes wild with fear. then she screams. duncan jumps back, stunned, frightened and confused. tracy doesn't move. she just keeps screaming hysterically.}
