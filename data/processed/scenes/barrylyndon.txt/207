<A>__{patrick takes a hand of his mother and of roderick, in each of his little clammy ones.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i beg you not to quarrel so, but to love each other, so that we might meet again in heaven where brooksy told me quarrelsome people never go.}
<A>__{his mother is much affected by these admonitions, and roderick is too. patrick gives roderick a ring from his finger, and a locket to his mother. he says that these gifts are so that they will not forget him.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{at last, after two days, he died. there he lay, the hope of my family, the pride of my manhood, the link which kept me and my lady cosgrove together.}
