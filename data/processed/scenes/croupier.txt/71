<L>__{interior bella's bedroom night}
<A>__{she sits him on the bed. the room is lit with coloured lamps.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{excuse the mess.}
<A>__{jack pulls her suddenly into his arms, pulls her onto the bed. she is startled.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{careful.}
<A>__{jack's hands open her blouse. he reaches for her breast. bella's surprise becomes excitement. he kisses her hungrily, his hands rummaging in her clothes. she reaches for a side zip in her skirt.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{don't tear anything.}
<A>__{bella kicks off her shoes. there is a burst of passion between them. for jack, a continuation of the violence with the man on the street. for bella, it's a sudden release. her naked foot knocks over the bedside lamp. jack spreads bella on the bed. she tugs his trousers down. he rips her black underwear away.}
