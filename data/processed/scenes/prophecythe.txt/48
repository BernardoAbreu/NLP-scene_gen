<L>__{exterior graveyard night}
<A>__{on a low hill at the edge of town. cracked, sinking headstones. the rambler's parked next to a new one, slim pickens on the am, as jerry digs up the fresh grave marked general arnold hawthorne. gabriel sits perched on the headstone over the grave like a winged creature.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i hope you're enjoying this.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i always enjoy watching you work, jerry.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{how did i ever get you in my life?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{come on, you didn't really want to kill yourself.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{but i did it, didn't i? i did kill myself.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{well, yes. technically.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{and you're just keeping me alive.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{letting you die slower.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i'm so in your debt.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{thank you, jerry. i'm touched. really.}
<A>__{jerry's shovel clanks onto something hard. he scrapes away the dirt, revealing a coffin lid. with a socket wrench jerry removes the fastening bolts, then with the edge of his shovel, pries open the lid. it's the ancient, wasted general we saw at the beginning. his medals flash in the moonlight.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{not much to look at.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{ah, but it's not what's on the outside that matters }
<A>__{gabriel leaps off his perch down into the grave.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{ it's what's on the inside.}
<A>__{gabriel reaches down, places one hand on the general's forehead, one on his chin, and breaks the mouth open. he gazes down into it. then suddenly stiffens and straightens up.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{it's not here.}
<A>__{gabriel frantically look in the ears. up the nose.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{it's not here!}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{oooh, bad news for the war effort.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(spins wildly on him)}
<D>__{shut up!!}
<A>__{gabriel bangs the coffin lid in frustration. tries to think.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{now, if you were a soul, where would you hide?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{the hell away from you.}
