<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{the occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. if they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.}
<A>__{as beverly and the doctor examine the x ray, we move to ruby, who's looking down at cochrane. he's still in bed and on a respirator. she smoothes his hair with affection. picard stands on the other side of the bed, watching her.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{were the two of you... involved?}

<A>__{ruby looks at him with a smile.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{i didn't.}

<C>__{picard}
<D>__{it can't wait until tomorrow...}
<C>__{ruby}
