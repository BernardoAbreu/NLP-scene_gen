<A>__{we hear the sound of martial drums and trumpets and tubas. the dalai lama is at his telescope. three thousand pla soldiers march along the shepherds's trail. they march behind huge, red banners of mao tse tung and chu te. this time, the soldiers do look like monsters. their faces are grey coated with tibetan dust. their peaked hats look vaguely like horns, their tattered, khaki uniforms like rough hide. monks line the trail, whipping at the soldiers with their long, maroon robes. women and children spit at the chinese, clap at them, hoping to chase this evil away.}
