<L>__{exterior farmhouse morning.}
<A>__{a hot summer's day. there are tall hedges all around the house. fergus leads jody, still bound and hooded, over toward a greenhouse.}
<L>__{interior greenhouse day}
<A>__{dusty tomato plants and vines everywhere. broken glass. the sun pouring through. fergus leads jody over to a wrought iron chair and sits him in it. he sits opposite, gun on his lap. fergus takes some sandwiches out of a brown paper bag. he holds one out toward him.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{eat something, would you?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{can't.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{what do you mean you can't?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{can't eat through a canvas bag.}
<A>__{fergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips. jody eats, slowly.}
