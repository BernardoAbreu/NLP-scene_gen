<L>__{int bedroom, hooker ranch late day}
<A>__{it's late and the last rays of the sun come through the window, falling on the bed where doc lies, awake but looking like hell. wyatt sits next to him, staring at the floor. after a moment:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{what makes a man like ringo, doc? what makes him do the things he does?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{a man like ringo's got a great empty hole right through the middle of him and no matter what he does he can't ever fill it. he can't kill enough or steal enough or inflict enough pain to ever fill it. and it drives him mad. sick mad. cold and dirty.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{so what does he want?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{what does he want? he wants revenge.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{revenge? for what?}
<A>__{doc looks at him, a look of purest sadness in his sunken eyes.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{being born.}
<A>__{wyatt looks down again and it's a long time before he speaks:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{remember how i said it all happened so fast with curly bill i didn't have time to think about it? well i've had plenty of time to think about this. i spent most of my life since i was born not knowing what i want out of life, just chasin' my tail. but now, for the first time i know exactly what i want. and who. and that's the damnable misery of it.}
<P>__{(pauses, looks at doc)}
<D>__{i can't beat him, can i?}
<A>__{doc shakes his head. wyatt nods then stands, ready to exit, but:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{no, wait, i will go with you...}
<A>__{doc struggles to sit up, sweating and trembling, finally falling back down, almost passing out. wyatt puts a hand on his forehead.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm sorry, wyatt. god, i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{that's all right, doc. don't worry.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{never got to wear one of those.}
<A>__{doc points to wyatt's badge. he takes it off, pressing it into doc's hand. doc smiles then does pass out. wyatt exits....}
