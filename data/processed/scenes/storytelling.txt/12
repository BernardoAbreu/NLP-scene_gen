<A>__{there is a soft knock at the door. he turns away from the mirror and opens it. vi is there, teary eyed, disheveled.}

<D>__{'...so john flipped her around and slammed her against the wall. jane braced herself: she thought about her mother. she thought about peter. she thought about god...and rape. ''say, 'fuck me, nigger. fuck me hard.''' john's flesh abraded her soft skin. there would be marks. she acquiesced, and said what he asked her to say, and did what he asked her to do. she had entered college with hope, with dignity, but she would graduate as a whore.'}

<D>__{why do people have to be so ugly...write about such ugly characters? it's perverted. i know you all think i'm being prisssy, but i don't care. i was brought up in a certain way. and this is...mean spirited!}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{yeah, well, it did seem a little affected. like by using taboo language you were trying to shock us about the hollowness of your characters.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i think it was a little bit racist.}
<C>__{elli}
<D>__{it was completely racist, and beyond that i felt deeply offended as a woman. as if a woman can only operate from experiences of objectification.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{totally phallocentric.}
<C>__{elli}
<D>__{and so weirdly misogynistic. i mean, why does jane go through with this? is she stupid?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{hey, but wasn't this a rape? or ...did i miss something? because i i'm confused. because if this was a rape, then why would she be a whore?}

<D>__{it was confessional, yet dishonest. jane pretends to be horrified by the sexuality that she in fact fetishizes. she subsumes herself to the myth of black male potency, but then doesn't follow through. she thinks she 'respects afro americans,' she thinks they're 'cool,' 'exotic,' what a notch he 'd make in her belt, but, of course, it all comes down to mandingo cliche, and he calls her on it. in classic racist tradition she demonizes, then runs for cover. but then, how could she behave otherwise? she's just a spoiled suburban white girl with a benneton rainbow complex. it's just my opinion, and what do i know...but i think it's a callow piece of writing.}

<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{i don't know about 'what happened,' vi, because once you start writing, it all becomes fiction. still, it certainly is an improvement over your last story: there is now at least a beginning, a middle, and an end.}
