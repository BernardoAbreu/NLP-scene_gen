<A>__{spider man swings painfully, one handed and limp, at the end of a web strand. after falling ten stories, he is groggy and weak. he can't think. he can't focus. he can barely hold onto his wrist gizmos. this bug is spent.}
<D>__{spider man must go on... must find ock... sl 270 plutonium... must get that crazy old loony... before he gets to the plutonium... toxic dump... where are the toxic dumps...?}
<A>__{he hangs there with two hands to catch his breath and thinks. he shoots a web up diagonally and swings across on it. this time he catches on and holds, but barely.}
