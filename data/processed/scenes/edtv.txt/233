<P>__{(to the camera)}
<D>__{ray, you were right. it's like in school. i was always saying "the room was too hot, the teacher didn't like me" but it was me! everything that's wrong with my life i did. okay? so now this is it. my family has problems. which are our fault. and tv is not the place to solve them. so i quit. i'm taking what very little dignity i've got left and i quit. can someone validate my parking?}
<A>__{pause. shock.}
<C>__{mr. scharlach}
<D>__{well, ed, that's ... not really possible.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{all right, i'11 pay for the parking. big network!}
<A>__{scharlach speaks carefully gently. he's aware of the camera. he doesn't want to come off as a villain.}
<C>__{scharlach}
<D>__{no, i mean you can't quit.}
<A>__{ed thinks.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i can't?}
<C>__{mr. scharlach}
<P>__{(very gently)}
<D>__{well, no. you agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. the station entered into this on that understanding. if you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. you can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. it's not fair to us. more importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. they're interested in you. they've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{look, if you don't let me out of this... i'11 just... i'11 just sit in my apartment all day. i won't go anywhere, i won't do anything. what kind of show will that be?}
<C>__{mr. scharlach}
<D>__{not too good. that's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. ed, i urge you to reconsider. i urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. play fair with them, ed.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{all right. let them decide.}
<A>__{he turns right to the camera.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{i'd like you all to do me a favor. turn me off. just grab the remote and change the channel. i mean, basically, all you're watching now is a guy deteriorate. the only thing missing is the smell. you're better than that turn me off. thank you.}
