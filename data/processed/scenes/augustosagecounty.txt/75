<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you better find out from jean exactly what went on before you start pointing fingers. cause i doubt jean's blameless in all this. and i'm not blaming her, just cause i said she's not blameless doesn't mean i've blamed her. i'm saying she might share in the responsibility. it's not cut and dried, black and white, good and bad. it lives where everything lives: somewhere in the middle. where the rest of us live, everyone but you.}

<D>__{he's not perfect. just like the rest of us, down here in the muck. i'm no angel myself. i've done some things i'm not proud of. things you'll never know about. i may even have to do some things i'm not proud of again. cause sometimes life puts you in a corner that way.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{and i am a human being, after all. anyway. you have your own hash to settle. before you start making speeches to the rest of us.}
