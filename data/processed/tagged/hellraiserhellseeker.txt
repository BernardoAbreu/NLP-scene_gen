<A>__{kirsty gooding looks out the passenger window as the trees go whizzing past. she's attractive, late twenties, warmly sophisticated. something makes her smile. she turns to the driver and thinks real hard as she says this.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{okay. cubic root of nine thousand two hundred and sixty one.}
<A>__{trevor is her husband, late twenties as well. god gave him brains and beauty. he has used them both prodigiously.}
<C>__{trevor}

<D>__{you win! okay pull over.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(looking at his watch)}
<D>__{but... i thought...}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{if what i've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. clock's ticking. tick tock...}
<A>__{trevor waits a moment to see if she's kidding.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(through clenched teeth)}
<D>__{pull over now.}
<A>__{then pulls over to the side of the road. kirsty reaches over, quickly unzips his pants immediately goes down on trevor out of frame. he reacts accordingly. a little pleasure, utter shock.}
<C>__{kirsty's voice}
<P>__{(from below frame)}
<D>__{honey what's wrong?}
<A>__{kirsty rises into frame once again.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what isn't wrong? why are you doing this anyway?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(self conscious)}
<D>__{i'm... i'm doing a very special thing here. and you can't even ... respond?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{sorry honey the present situation isn't exactly fodder for an erection. shouldn't we be getting to the hospital?}
<A>__{full on kirsty. for the first time we see her big pregnant belly sticking out. she looks at trevor innocently.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i was going to keep breathing you know. you think i'm an amateur or something?}
<A>__{trevor stuffs himself back in his pants, puts the car in gear and presses the accelerator.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{just concentrate on the task at hand please. listen to me. you should be giving me this lecture.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{you've been cheating on me haven't you?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{yes i had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i would never cheat on you. not while you're pregnant now you know that.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(features tightening)}
<D>__{okay... uh oh here comes another one.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{share the pain kirsty.}
<A>__{she takes trevor's hand and squeezes as hard as she can. in}
<T>__{close up we see:}
<A>__{a solved rubic's cube sitting between them. do we need this vision of the solved rubics cube?}
<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{the car is approaching a bridge.}
<L>__{interior car day}
<A>__{trevor takes his hand off the wheel to look at his watch.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{one fifteen.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(in dire pain)}
<D>__{oh god...... trevor, i think my water just broke.}
<A>__{trevor grabs the wheel again. kirsty gasps.}
<C>__{kirsty }
<D>__{oh my god. it's coming out.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{the baby is coming out! i can feel it! sonofabitch it hurts!! aaagggghhh!!!}
<A>__{trevor looks at her, trying to stay calm.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{okay kirsty don't panic. just keep breathing! don't panic! put the seat back and hold on to something. were almost there!}
<A>__{kristy's hand moves down the along side the seat between the door and she plunges back with the seat. she looks at trevor wide eyed. shes about to give birth in a chevrolet.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{oh my god trevor! it hurts!! (breathing heavily) oh my god, oh my god. trevor, it's coming out.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{this isn't happening.}
<A>__{kristy starts to convulse with pain. she begins to tremble and her arms flail about in an attempt to ease her discomfort. she grabs trevors arm for support.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{honey, take it easy. your gonna be alright.}
<A>__{kristy becomes more violent, kicking her legs up onto the dashboard. she starts grabbing trevors arm a little more violently, causing trevors to weave a bit on the road as he recoils.}
<L>__{exterior car driving down country road day}
<A>__{the car lunges to the side of the road and weaves a bit in the gravel. up ahead a bridge approaches.}
<L>__{interior car day}
<A>__{trevor regains control of the car.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{kristy! take it easy. everythings gonna be alright. com'on, start the breathing, with me... come on. one, two three, and blow..}
<A>__{trevor starts the lamanns method alone, as kristy appears to have passed out from the pain. she has her head leaned away from him and is limp in the passengers seat.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{krist. honey. kristy!}
<A>__{kristy doesn't answer. trevors puts his arm on her and shakes her. she doesn't react.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{kristy! honey wake up!}
<A>__{trevors attention is now on his unconscious wife rather than the two lane road which stretches across the bridge.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{honey, wake up. please wake up.}
<A>__{and with that kristy's does exactly that. she lunges toward him in a violent spasm and scares the shit out of him (and us) which causes trevor to now completely lose control of the car.}
<L>__{interior exterior car day}
<A>__{the rest is a blur... ... trevor loses control of the steering wheel... kirsty screams... their car skids from one side of the bridge to the other careening toward the guardrail smash! the car is plummeting toward the river below. trevor and kirsty brace themselves. the car hits the surface...}
<L>__{interior river, underwater day}
<A>__{trevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles. he breaks the surface and gasps for air. getting his bearings he see the car bobbing on the surface, the current is separating him from his wife. treading water, he looks out at the car and there she is trapped inside... kirsty still belted to her seat. her eyes are wide with desperation, breath quickening, sinking fast... kristy pounds the window with her hands, trying to get out. she's trapped. apparently giving in, she presses a hand against the windshield just before the car disappears under the surface...}
<L>__{exterior shore day}
<A>__{trevor paddles hard to the shore. exhausted, he crawls onto the shore underneath the bridge they just jumped. trevor stands trying to process what just happened in the last fifteen seconds. he screams out for his wife, and to what has just happened.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{kristy! kristy!}
<A>__{trevor drops to his knee's in distress.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{oh my god, kristy! please kristy.}
<P>__{(frantically) i'm so sorry, kristy.}
<A>__{he hears something from above and looks up. a chunk of the bashed up guardrail from the bridge has just snapped off and is sailing right down toward him }
<B>__{trevor blacks out just as the thing hits him white light floods his vision...}
<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{trevor's eyes blink open, darting left and right. he is on a bed, his head bandaged. an angular nurse enters the room, walking up to trevor's bed.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{where is she...? where's kirsty?}
<A>__{the nurse grabs trevor's right arm and straps it to the side of the bed. she isn't exactly one of god's gentler creatures.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{hey, what are you }
<A>__{she moves to trevor's legs, strapping them down as well, then his other arm. by now several surgeons enter the room, features obscured by surgical masks. the nurse fastens a clamp around trevor's head, attaches it to the bed. trevor is completely discombobulated. the surgeons gather behind trevor's bed. close on trevor's face as he struggles to see what's happening back there but it's useless. he cannot move a muscle. he hears a sickening sawing noise and his eyes bulge in horror. wide as the doctors calmly lift trevor's freshly sawed cranium from his head exposing his brain. the chief surgeon a large unshaven man with magnifying lens alreaday in place make his eyes enormous and his face grotesquely distorted. he walks up, presented with a tray full of evenly arranged pins. he cranks up the magnification of his lenes which make his eyes appear even larger. though no one speaks his name his name tag reads dr. barker.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what are you people doing?!}
<A>__{the chief surgeon takes one of the pins and gently pushes into a trevor's frontal lobe.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{what's happening to !}
<A>__{trevor's eyes glaze over and his jaw relaxes. the chief surgeon speaks in an english accent.}
<C>__{chief surgeon}
<D>__{as you can see i just accessed the speech center, temporarily shutting down all verbal ability.}
<A>__{as the chief surgeon continues he takes several more pins off the tray.}
<C>__{chief surgeon }
<D>__{the goal is find the exact point in the brain where moral decisions are made, the place where right and wrong is distinguished. in exploring this morality center i will most likely be triggering memories, disrupting the unconscious. our patient may experience some distress during the proceedings but they are not due to pain. it is merely our patient recalling his past...}
<A>__{chief surgeon slips another pin into trevors exposed brain.}
<C>__{chief surgeon }
<D>__{as he was thrown into the lake, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown.}
<A>__{the chief surgeon voice lowers and his eyes turn black. the eye magification no at a hideous level, showing jet black eyes.}
<C>__{chief surgeon }
<D>__{where you will be tormented day and night}
<P>__{for ever and ever. (rev.20:10)}
<A>__{trevor looks at the frowning nurse who is watching over him. chief surgeon sticks a needle into another spot on trevor's brain. trevor's pov: the nurse is suddenly a pale gargoyle with blackened eyes. trevor opens his mouth to scream and in a burst of white light, an angelic woman is now standing before him. she is bathed in a haze of white light.}
<C>__{angelic woman}
<D>__{well? what do say trevor? que pasa?}
<A>__{trevor relaxes. his bindings are gone. the gargoyle nurse is gone. the surgeons are gone. and his brain is sitting safely within his inviolated skull, upon which now sit a few electrodes. the bandage is no longer there. but from his pain wracked expression we know the pain in his head is still very real. he reaches for his head, makes sure its all intact.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{where do i start?}
<C>__{angelic woman}
<D>__{how's the old noggin? any change in the intensity?}
<A>__{she touches him gently.}
<C>__{angelic woman }
<D>__{can you describe the pains?}
<A>__{trevor looks up. the angelic woman smiles back at him. she's in scrubs, a stethoscope dangling from her neck. trevor winces.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i'm not sure. how about a jackhammer in the occipital lobe?}
<A>__{she picks up a pad and scribbles something on it. trevor notices she's wearing a nameplate. dr. allison dormere.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{are you a dream too?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{still hallucinating as well. hmm...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what just happened to me anyway? it looked like a dream but it felt like reality.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{it's the morphine trevor. you're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.}
<A>__{terevors quickly recalls the accident. fearing the worst.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{where's kirsty? where's my wife?}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{your wife...?}
<A>__{an older doctor walks in. ambrose. he gives trevor an icy look, then looks at trevor's chart.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(to ambrose)}
<D>__{still a little hazy. he's still in pain too, even after the morphine. i recommend we admit him. at least for another day...}
<P>__{(leaning in, sotto)}
<D>__{he just asked for his wife...}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{well i can't find any abnormalities. i think we're ready for discharge.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{but, dr. ambrose }
<C>__{ambrose}
<P>__{(looking up at trevor)}
<D>__{i think it's time to ween you off these painkillers too. wouldn't want you to develop a dependency to them. you might do things like come to the hospital for no reason other than to get a fix, wouldn't you?}
<A>__{ambrose gives trevor a fatherly smile then exits, not even looking at allison. allison watches him go, then turns back to trevor... then smiles perkily.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{well looks like you're going home! hope you brought your bus pass.}
<L>__{interior bus night}
<A>__{trevor starts nodding out. the bus is practically empty. two black children a boy and a girl sit across from trevor. a creepy old woman sits further back, knitting something. a church bell ringing causes trevor to wake again up, wincing at the sound. as the church passes the bell becomes louder and louder. trevor hears laughter and looks up at the children. the girl and her brother seem to be play fighting over a toy they hold between them. trevor looks at the toy getting stretched this way and that.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{do you kids mind keeping it down?}
<A>__{the creepy old woman speaks up.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{aww let them be. they're only kids.}
<A>__{trevor notices what the old woman is knitting is a baby's bootie. as the children continue to laugh at him trevor stares at the bootie tears welling up.}
<L>__{interior trevor's apt. night}
<A>__{trevor lives in a dingy place, one step up from poverty level. funny thing is this used to be a nicer place. we see remnants of a feminine touch long since past. dirty dishes sit in the sink. a cockroach skitters across the kitchenette. trevor sits at his tv playing an extremely violent videogame. we're talking heads getting blown off, bodies exploding, limbs being severed. as the end ends a demonic voice chuckles from the tv.}
<C>__{demonic voice from tv}
<D>__{you lose...}
<A>__{the screen flashes try again? trevor takes a swig of beer and sits back in the easy chair looking at something atop the tv. a picture of kirsty.}
<L>__{interior trevor's kitchen night}
<A>__{trevor looks through an old photo album. pictures of him and kirsty. some pictures of him. a lot of pictures of kirsty. smiles, smiles, smiles... he stops at one close up of them mugging at a camera they've pointed on themselves. all we see is their faces, the rest is dark and blurry, except for one thing. a small shadowy object kirsty is holding.}
<L>__{exterior cubic route actuarial research day}
<A>__{dressed in a button down shirt and tie, trevor walks up to the pale utilitarian box like structure.}
<L>__{interior cubic route, bullpen day}
<A>__{it is a maze of cubicles iced by harsh fluorescence. it is a mill of data research, where the tapping of fingers on computer keypads never ends...}
<L>__{interior trevor's cubicle day}
<A>__{... no thanks to trevor, who has already resumed his head in hands position at his desk. he rubs his eyes, seemingly blinded by the screen staring back at him. a man trevor's age rolls up on his office chair beside trevor, banging into the desk. bret. trevor's co worker and cubicle mate.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{hey bret. christ, my head feels like a split coconut.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. it was made by your ass. you've been dragging it all fucking week. what happened to you yesterday?}
<A>__{bret eyes trevor suspiciously. then smiling...}
<C>__{bret }
<D>__{you never came back after lunch. did you get a piece o'ass, you bastard?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{give me a break. i checked back into the hospital amongst other things.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{hospital? you haven't been to the hospital since uh...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{since what?}
<C>__{bret}
<P>__{(getting uncomfortable)}
<D>__{look never mind. just get some numbers going any numbers at all will due. the hills have eyes remember?}
<A>__{bret casually gestures to a surveillance camera overhead that sweeps across the room like a prison spotlight.}
<C>__{bret }
<D>__{i'm just looking out for ya.}
<A>__{bret slides back over to his work station. trevor puts his hands on the computer keys and starts to type. a jolt of pain rips through his cranium forcing him to stop. bret stops typing and breathes an exasperated sigh.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{sixty five point three percent of all headaches are due to low sugar levels in the bloodstream trevor.}
<A>__{a light bulb seems to go off over trevor's head.}
<L>__{interior break room day}
<A>__{inside the narrow room blasted in fluorescent light, trevor eyes a vending machine, examining its wares. he peruses the sundry sugary snacks, looking for just the right fix. it's so quiet in here we can almost hear his head pounding in pain. he shuts his eyes. a couple of the fluorescent bulbs over his head wink out and the rest flicker weakly. when trevor opens his eyes again he notices the room has gotten considerably darker. he looks up at the weakening lights and grunts in disgust. the light is just dim enough now so that he can't see what's in the vending machine. he goes right up to the glass and peers into the machine, using his hand as a visor. this strain on his eyes intensifies his headache. it's still pretty murky inside the glass case. trevor squints and just when he thinks he can read a wrapper on... what is it? a candy bar? a pale hand suddenly presses against the glass from inside the machine. trevor jolts backwards. the hand is gone. but in the reflection of the glass trevor notices someone has been standing behind him. he whirls around and is face to face with our worst nightmare: pinhead.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{it's too late.}
<A>__{pinhead lashes out at trevor striking his face with a clawed hand the rips his face clean off. the lights are back up as trevor slams against the machine and grabs his face. it's still there! where pinhead was standing is the woman who just slapped him.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{snap out of it!}
<A>__{she is attractive and studious. her sensible business attire can't hide a very curvaceous body. this is trevor's supervisor gwen.}
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{jesus what the hell was that? it's like you saw a ghost or something.}
<A>__{trevor slowly peers into the vending machine. nope. nobody here but your average every day candy bars. trevor is dumbfounded.}
<C>__{gwen }
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{come on speak up, gooding, i'm trying to run a business here. i can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{sorry i just kind of... spaced for a second there.}
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{well don't let it happen again. or i may have to spank you.}
<A>__{gwen grins sinfully at trevor and pushes his shoulders back against the vending machine. before he realizes it, she's kissing him real hard. he gently ducks out from under her, freeing himself.}
<C>__{gwen }
<D>__{get back here, junior bean counter. this is your supervisor speaking.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{please, gwen. you're you're all over me.}
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{how do you think you got this job, cock?}
<P>__{(cozying up to him)}
<D>__{mmm. i'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim.}
<A>__{trevor looks constipated. he has no recollection of this. gwen strokes his face.}
<C>__{gwen }
<D>__{what's wrong, trev?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{nothing, look. gwen i really like you }
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{and it shows. least it did last night at the quarry. in a big way.}
<A>__{trevor gently pushes her off him again.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{please you're going way too fast for me here.}
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{you're giving me a speeding ticket? mr. mario andretti himself?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{gwen, my wife's dead.}
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{oh i see. that again. trevor? i realize it must be hard. but christ how long does it take someone to move on?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{that was cold...}
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{no, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. that's cold.}
<A>__{this goes through trevor like a shot. eight months! here we go dolly in zoom out! in close up of trevor we...}
<B>__{flashback}
<A>__{quick flashes of kirsty's hand pounding on the windshield, the car sinking into the lake, a quick cut of a dark figure with a bright ring, and shots of two naked bodies slamming against each other in climax course through trevor's mind. finally, over the images of erotica we hear gwens voice as one of the characters.}
<C>__{gwen }
<D>__{yeah, trevor thats it. thats it.}
<A>__{and back in the real world, trevor is now locking lips with a very ready gwen. his hand is up her skirt. he stops abruptly and pulls back.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i'm sorry gwen. i don't know what's happening to me. (zipping up) i think it's the painkillers, really.}
<A>__{gwen rolls her eyes. she re adjusts her self and now getting a little pissy. she's heard this one before.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{they mess with my head. yesterday gets blacked out and a memory from months ago is played out in vivid technicolor. like the accident just happened you know?}
<A>__{gwen softens up. trevor is so earnest, so vulnerable.}
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{why don't you let me take you out tonight? i promise to make it the most memorable night of your life.}
<A>__{she kisses him. he braces himself. she grabs his butt, then goes for the door.}
<C>__{gwen }
<D>__{pick you up round seven. and gooding? get some fucking work done.}
<L>__{interior trevor's cubicle day}
<A>__{trevor relentlessly crunches numbers at his computer. he pauses a moment to stretch and rubs his eyes. a ping from his computer announces he has an interoffice memo file attached. trevor goes to the mailbox on his screen, clicks. up comes a jpeg slideshow. each picture is of gwen dressed in a piece of sexy lingerie. the caption underneath reads work harder. looking around his cubicle, he then takes another look at the jpeg. trevor stands up in the cubicle and we see him peer the outer office looking for gwen. he sits back down. embarrassed trevor closes the memo at least for now. trevor's phone rings. startleing him(and us). he picks it up.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{you got trevor.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<P>__{(from phone)}
<D>__{trevor hi this is detective lange from homicide. it's about your wife.}
<A>__{push in on to a bewildered trevor.}
<L>__{interior lange's office, homicide day}
<A>__{it is a dank crumbling room. a place where sunlight is not welcome. detective lange, a handsome graying gentleman who's plagued with a chronic case of post nasal drip, sits at his desk. trevor sits across from him. behind trevor is another empty desk. as lange speaks he sniffs wetly every so often.}
<C>__{lange}
<P>__{(to trevor)}
<D>__{thanks for coming down mr. gooding. has your head healed okay by now?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{where's my wife?}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{okay then. here's the scoop.}
<A>__{lange takes out nasal drops and squeezes some in each nostril as he speaks.}
<D>__{lange (cont'd) (cont'd) we still haven't been able to locate your the body in that river. and missing persons turned up some evidence that qualified the disappearance as foul play.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what evidence?}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{for one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{it should all in the report. i told you guys everything. she was giving birth in the fucking car. she grabbed the wheel and i lost control.}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{i did read that, yes. (flipping through the report) what hospital were you going to? i mean the lodovico street bridge isn't exactly on the way to mercy general.}
<A>__{trevor looks numb, unable to answer. lange poker faced, keeps looking through the reoport.}
<D>__{lange (con't) (cont'd) listen we really are at a stalemate here until we find the body itself. is there any way you did not tell missing persons everything that happened just before that accident?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{why wouldn't i tell you everything?}
<P>__{(impatiently) look, i've been fully}
<D>__{cooperative...}
<P>__{(quick to add)}
<D>__{... to my recollection.}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{i'm sorry mr. gooding, i meant no disrespect. i'm just doing my job here, ok? i mean between your head injury and the fact that you are on very strong pain medication, you might not be remembering a few details about the crash which might help us here.}
<A>__{lange takes a deep hit of the nasal spray.}
<C>__{lange }
<D>__{what you're recalling could be a fabrication you've made up about it. do you follow?}

<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{kristy noooo!}
<A>__{and he makes a move toward the car, as the box comes to life. this stops trevor in his tracks, and he looks toward allison. who is now pinhead.}

<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{look, whatever your marharagi, told you, forget. you've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.}
<C>__{sage}
<D>__{it was an analogy. your soul is locked up inside you. you need to free it trevor. you've blocked it from the healing process. that's what we need to do now. heal your soul. and to do that i you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. do you know what i mean by giving in? it's about trust. do you trust me implicitly?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i don't even know what's real and what isn't how can i trust anyone?}
<C>__{sage}
<D>__{you can trust me. your wife is dead and you need to move past that. and the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. surrender yourself to your wife's death. let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. it's the only way you can become whole again.}

<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i don't know what i'm doing here. i'm not even catholic. i just had to tell somebody. it's like, ever since my wife died i don't know what i've actually done or what i've imagined. but i do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... i've done some really awful things in my life. things that i've... i guess i've blocked out...}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{what things do you think you've done?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{wow. let's see. so many sins so little time. for starters i was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. that was so i could collect her eight million dollar estate. i think i killed several women i was having mindless sex with behind her back.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{but i did those murders just for the hell of it. finally... i think i made some kind of deal with the devil and now he's come to collect my soul. only he's decided to mess with my head first. how many hail marys do you recommend for that one father?}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{trevor i'm sure you killed no one. you are very distraught over your wife's death and rightfully so. you did the right thing by confessing to me here tonight. and you should keep praying for the wisdom that will set your soul at ease. that being said, you are still in a highly emotional state right now. it might do you some good to get some professional help. confess to them the way you confessed to me. in time you'll probably find that the real killer has already been caught. or better yet... that these murders never happened at all.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{but i saw these women. i saw their mutilated bodies. i saw their ghosts. i just know it happened i can feel it...}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{all you've got is the here and the now trevor. that's all anyone really has. maybe this will make things easier to understand. a man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. in time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. and at the end of the day does it even matter? all these events you're describing. how can you be sure any of them really happened?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{but that's what i need. to be sure... to be absolutely sure...}
