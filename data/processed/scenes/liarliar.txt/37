<L>__{interior judge stevens's chambers morning}
<A>__{dana and an apprehensive fletcher sit before the judge}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{your honor, under the terms of the prenuptual agreement, if mrs. cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing. we have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not her husband.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{sounds pretty damning, mr. reid.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{it certainly does.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{however, my client has no desire to see his ex wife destitute. against my advice, he's willing to offer her a cash settlement of.two point four million dollars.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{two four seems like a pretty fair offer, mr. reid.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{fantastically fair. phenominally fair. in fact, i'd say beyond fair, bordering on stupid.}
<A>__{dana fumes. the judge finds fletcher's boldness refreshing.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{what are you suggesting, mr. rei d? that ms. appleton's willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack of faith in her position?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<P>__{(utterly sincere)}
<D>__{no, not at all. she's got my client dead to rights. when attorneys go to sleep at night, they dream of having a case as strong as hers.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{can the sarcasm, reid. all right, i admit it i've seen you make even the lamest case fly. but this time i have you. even clarence darrow couldn't explain this away.}
<A>__{she brandishes the audiotape.}
<C>__{judge samioan}
<D>__{wel l, mr. reid? without a dynamite explanation, i'd say you're dead in the water. how's you client's story?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{the best that money can buy, y o u r honor.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{strong corroborating evidence?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{we have evidence that you are not going to believe.}
<A>__{despite herself, dana is beginning to look worried.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{you're pretty confident how this trial is going to come out, eh, mr. reid?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<P>__{(hopeless) .}
<D>__{confident" is too weak a word, your honor. i am certain what will happen if i take this puppy to trial. the verdict will be a stunning, humiliating defeat that will cut a spectacularly promising legal career off at the knees.}
<A>__{fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but dana thinks he's speaking about her. she buckles.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{all right! double the offer! four point eight! and not a penny more.}
<P>__{(venomous, to fletcher)}
<D>__{bastard!}
<A>__{she storms out, leaving an astounded fletcher behind.}
<C>__{judge stevens}
<D>__{you are some negotiator, mr. reid. if your client has half a brain, she'll jump at the offer.}
