<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{maybe. but he'd still be the boss.}
<A>__{capone sticks a cigar in his mouth, and strikes a match to light it. the side window explodes under a shower of bullets from a passing car.}
<B>__{capone}
<A>__{dives to the floor. charlie pulls a pistol from his jacket and returns the fire, as the limo driver jerks the steering wheel to the left, ramming the limousine into the side of the other car. a second hail of bullets cuts the limo diver dead. the two cars careen together, crashing into a parked car.}
<B>__{outside the crashed cars}
<A>__{as the gunman escapes from the second car. he tosses his empty machine gun aside, pulls out a pistol, and runs down an alley, leaving his wounded driver behind.}
<B>__{capone looks up from the floor}
<A>__{the stub of his cigar clenched in his teeth, the remainder shot off. charlie strikes a match and lights capone's cigar.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you're a big target, al. finish your cigar.}
<B>__{luciano}
<A>__{advances down the pitch dark alley, pistol drawn, silhouetted against the light from the street behind him. a flash of gunfire from the end of the alley, sends charlie diving behind a line of trash cans.}
<B>__{charlie crawls down the alley}
<A>__{using the trash cans as cover. two more shots ring out, bouncing off the trash cans. charlie shouts to the gunman.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's three.}
<A>__{peering over the trash cans, charlie can see that the alley is a dead end, but he still can't make out the gunman. luciano grabs a bottle and tosses it down the alley. as the gunman wastes a shot on the decoy, charlie dashes across the alley, ducking behind a dumpster.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{four!}
<A>__{charlie pushes the dumpster down the alley, as he crouches behind it. as he nears the end of the alley, two more shots ping off the sides of the dumpster.}

<D>__{five! six!}
<A>__{charlie turns his back to the dumpster, gun drawn. waiting for the rat to scurry from his hole.}
<B>__{the gunman}
<A>__{cowering at the end of the alley, drops his emptied gun to the pavement. he looks to the right of the dumpster, then the left. torn over which path to take. he makes a run to the left.}
<B>__{as the gunman races past the dumpster}
<A>__{charlie calmly takes aim, and fells him with a single shot.}
<B>__{as charlie approaches the limousine}
