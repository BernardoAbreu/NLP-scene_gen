<L>__{interior office}
<A>__{brendan sits with an ice pack against his head in a tiny office. a man in his early thirties behind a wood colored desk and name plate, "gary trueman, assistant vice principal" plays with a pencil.}

<D>__{you didn't know this boy?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{no sir, never seen him.}
<C>__{trueman}
<D>__{and he just hit you?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{like i said, he asked for my lunch money first. good thing i brown bagged it.}
<A>__{trueman trains a good natured dubious eye on brendan.}
<C>__{trueman}
<D>__{alright brendan. i've been looking to talk to you.}
<A>__{brendan doesn't react.}
<C>__{trueman }
<D>__{you've helped this office out before.}
<C>__{brendan}

<C>__{trueman}
<D>__{fine, and well put.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{accelerated english, mrs. kasprzyk.}
<C>__{trueman}
<D>__{tough teacher?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{tough but fair.}
<C>__{trueman}
<D>__{mm. anyway then, we know you're clean, and you've, despite your motives, you've been an asset to us. i think you're a good kid.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{trueman}
<D>__{i want to run a couple names by you.}
<A>__{brendan stands to go.}
<C>__{trueman }
<D>__{we're not done here.}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{i was done here three months ago. i told you then i'd give you jerr and that was that, i'm not your inside line and i'm not your boy.}
<C>__{trueman}
<D>__{that's not a very helpful }
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(anger builds)}
<D>__{you know what i'm in if the wrong yeg saw me pulled in here?}
<C>__{trueman}
<D>__{what are you in?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{no. and no more of these informal chats if you've got a discipline issue with me write me up or suspend me and i will see you at the parent conference.}
<C>__{trueman}
<D>__{hold it, i could hold it could write you up for talking back to a vp. for looking at me in a threatening way. i'd exercise a little more tact, mr. frye. you can't pull a play like that unless i need you for something. so do i?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{trueman}
<D>__{so maybe you're gonna need me too.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{maybe. alright, i need you off my back completely for a few weeks. there might be some heat soon.}
<C>__{trueman}
<P>__{(interested)}
<D>__{if it's something i can't cover, i won't go to bat for you.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{if i get caught like that it's curtains anyway i couldn't have brass cutting me favors in public. i'm just saying now so you don't come kicking in my homeroom door once trouble starts.}
<A>__{trueman bites a thumbnail.}
<C>__{trueman}
<D>__{okay, here's what i can do. i won't pin you for anything you aren't caught at. i will ride it a little while, as long as it doesn't get too rough. but if anything comes up with your fingerprints on it, i can't help you. also, if i get to the end of whatever this is and it gets hot and you don't deliver, the veep will need someone to hand over, police wise. and i will have you. there better be some meat at the end of this like you say, or at least a fall guy, or you're it.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{sure i am. got one more favor to ask.}
