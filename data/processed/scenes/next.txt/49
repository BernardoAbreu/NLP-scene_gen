<L>__{interior cabin parlor sunset}
<A>__{cris is lighting a fire he has built. liz drifts in, pensive.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{cris. do you think we met for a reason?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{you mean, do i believe a higher power brought us together?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{no. i think we're just the last in a long chain of accidents that started with the big bang.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{that's not very romantic.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{oh, but it is. think of it: for us to meet, everything from the very beginning, every sub atomic event, every galactic cataclysm, every step of evolution, every act, every accident, every decision in the history of the universe had to happen exactly the way it did just so you and i could be together, right here and now.}
<A>__{she is moved by his words, but they make her strangely sad. cris pours two glasses of scotch. hands one to liz.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{to whatever happens nexterior}
<A>__{she doesn't drink.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i shouldn't.}
<C>__{cris}
<P>__{(concerned)}

<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i'm late.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{late?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{that's why i went to the drug store. to get a pregnancy test.}
<A>__{off his puzzlement, she hands him a small plastic tab. a square cross is coming into focus. he recognizes the image from the donut shop display case just before he met liz for the first time.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{you know what this means?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{i do now.}
<A>__{they look at each other, equally perplexed.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{how did it...?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{i have no idea. unless...but that still doesn't explain...}
<A>__{she struggles to make sense of it.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{liz, i really did have this problem. i wasn't lying to you.}
<A>__{he can't read her reaction.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{but this is good. this is amazing. i want this baby more than anything.}
<A>__{she looks at him, emotional.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{it's like a miracle.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{for both of us.}
<A>__{she lets him hold her.}
