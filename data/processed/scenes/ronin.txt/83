<D>__{hey...}
<A>__{edvard is startled by the sound of sam's voice. even as he squeezes off the shot, edvard turns to look at sam, and as he does so, vincent strikes out at the gun, sending the shot awry, causing it to ricochet wildly, whining around the room, until it rips through sam's side, a nasty wound but not fatal, as edvard tries to fire another shot but it's too late, because vincent fires a single shot to the head that kills edvard.}
