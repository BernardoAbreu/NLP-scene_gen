<D>__{you heard the man.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{nice work, dyl.}
<A>__{they move into action.}
<L>__{exterior second story verandah day}
<A>__{dylan is led inside by the thin man. knox is waiting for her.}
<C>__{thin man}
<D>__{present for you, sir.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{dylan, how nice. welcome to my florida home. not as tasteful as the one in la, but much more private.}
<A>__{she shrugs off the goons enough already.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{so tell me, knox, what's the brilliant plan? you gonna sell a list of our foreign spies to the highest bidder? blackmail the president?}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{the first plan is too complicated, and the second is virtually impossible.}
<A>__{charlie's angels 8 18 99}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{besides, i already have all the money i need and my motivation is much simpler...}
<P>__{(leaning in close to her)}
<D>__{... revenge.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{revenge? against who?}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{you know what? i'm not in a gabby mood right now. i've got a score to settle.}
<A>__{he flips shut a suitcase filled with c 5 explosive, the same stuff we saw pascal selling in the opening scene.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{seems like you're going a bit overboard.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{no, just leaving myself plenty of margin for error. goodbye, dylan.}
<A>__{with that, he walks out of the room. the thin man signals to the henchmen. two of them force dylan to sit in one of the wooden deck chairs. then, with the thick packing tape, they begin binding her arms to the arms of the chair. as they do:}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{i don't know why you bother. i've already won.}
<C>__{thin man}
<D>__{is that so?}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{every moment i sit here is a moment i'm using to figure out how to take you down. in fact, this statement this one i'm making right here is just me stalling for time while i decide which of your goons i'm going to flatten first.}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{it's gonna be the guy behind me.}
<A>__{the thin man can't help but be amused. after all, there are six guards and one blonde who is now taped to a chair. charlie's angels 8 18 99}
<C>__{the thin man}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{by the time your guys are firing, i will be at about 180 on my reverse inverted 360, which will land me on fat boy there, as promised.}
<P>__{(nods to the second guard)}
<D>__{he'll take the chair seat in the chin.}
<P>__{(re: two others; very slowly)}
<D>__{now... i'm warning both of you: i'm going to get you to shoot each other. i know. cliche as that sounds.}
<P>__{(then to the last two)}
<D>__{last, you guys hell, i will make something up. we'll have fun.}
<A>__{the thin man smirks oh so confidently.}
<C>__{the thin man}
<D>__{and what will you do to me?}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{you won't even be here. i mean, i don't want to tell you how to do your job, but you should've killed me by now. because i already know that your people are onto my people, which means any moment now you're going to be called out to go and deal }
<A>__{suddenly the door flies open and }
<C>__{dylan }
<D>__{ah! see?}
<C>__{henchman at the door}
<D>__{we have intruders.}
<A>__{with a glare to dylan, the thin man follows him out.}
