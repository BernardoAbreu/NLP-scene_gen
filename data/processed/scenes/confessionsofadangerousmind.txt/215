<C>__{actual barris}
<D>__{that was it. i just disappeared. the network had to put the gong show into reruns. it was 1981. i holed myself up in this hotel in new york. parker hotel.}
<L>__{interior hotel room day}
<A>__{subtitle: new york city, spring 1982 we see barris from above, shivering and naked in the corner. the manuscript pages are piled high next to the typewriter. barris looks up at the camera with outstretched arms, appealing to the gods.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{who am i?}
<A>__{there is a pounding on the wall from a neighbor.}
<C>__{neighbor }
<D>__{who cares? shut the fuck up!}
<A>__{there's a knock at the door. barris crawls toward it, peeks through the peephole.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{fuck. shit. piss.}
<A>__{barris unlocks the door. simon oliver stands there.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{barris.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{how'd you know where i was?}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{chuck, chuck, chuck, don't be an orangutan. we always know where you are. we always know what you're doing. by the by, i'd think twice before i'd attempt to get that tripe you're writing published. and there's a typo on page }
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{look, what do you want, oliver? i don't work for you anymore. i have things to...}
<A>__{barris trails off.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{i'd like you to come back for one last assignment, chuck.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{no. now get... good bye}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{i think you might be interested when i tell you it's the mole who fingered your friends jim byrd and paul picard... and seigfried keeler.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{keeler committed suicide.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{yes, of course he did. he threw himself from a twentieth floor window after he strangled himself to death with an electrical cord.}
<C>__{barris}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm not interested, oliver.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{as long as the mole's alive, you don't have a chance in hell of remaining so. besides, killing is in your blood, old man. you fit the profile.}
<A>__{barris lunges at oliver, pushes him against the wall.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{that fucking profile again! what's the fuck is it?! what the fuck do you bastards know about me, that i don't?!}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{indeed. where to begin. first, let go of me.}
<A>__{barris lets go. oliver sits in a chair, straightens his shirt.}
<C>__{oliver }
<D>__{let's see. well, you had a twin sister, stillborn, strangled by your umbilical cord. your first hit, chuck. your mother always wanted a daughter. she blamed you for your sister's death. and, so, until your sister phoebe was born, she raised you as a girl.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{that's not true.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{oh, and your father the dentist? not really your father. your biological father was a man named edmund james windsor. a serial killer. a fact your mother didn't know when she had an affair with him in 1930. if you want to look him up, he was also known as the tarrytown troll, because he had been described by witnesses as short and ugly. windsor died in the electrical chair at ossining in 1939. we believed your self loathing tendencies coupled with that extra y chromosome and whatever else you inherited from your father would serve us well.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{you're lying.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{i'm trying to think what more i can tell you. i'm sure there's more. but you have me at a disadvantage here, barris. i don't have your files in front of me.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{just leave me the hell alone!}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{your mother always loved the game shows, and you so wanted to please her. we never expected the game show business to work out for you. but that it did, turned out to be in our favor. i guess your need to be a good daughter drove you more than we anticipated.}
<A>__{barris lunges at oliver. the two wrestle on the floor. barris punches him repeatedly in the face.}
