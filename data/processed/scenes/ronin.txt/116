<L>__{exterior the street outside a minute later late afternoon}
<A>__{the black compact car idles at a nearby curb, with deirdre behind the wheel. she's staring so intently at the front of the post office, that she's surprised when a shadow falls across her. she looks up to see sam, standing next to the car. deirdre starts to reach for her weapon, but sam cuts her off with a word.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{don't do it...}
<A>__{something in his voice conveys enough of a threat that she backs off. now she and sam exchange a long look.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{well, if it isn't mr. interpol himself.}
<P>__{(she really sounds betrayed)}
<D>__{i can't believe i misjudged you like i did.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{i'm a patriate.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{don't even think that i'm buying that.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{where do you get off saying word one? all the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, seamus and myself. and here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i didn't say i was.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(she sees something)}
<D>__{bloody fucking hell...}
