<L>__{interior mumford's office day}
<A>__{close on althea brockett.}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{ the argument had nothing to do with it.}
<C>__{mumford }
<D>__{i understand. i just want to know what the argument was about.}
<C>__{althea}
<P>__{(hates to say)}
<D>__{i had ordered some books. "the 100 greatest books ever written."}
<C>__{mumford }
<D>__{uh huh. what are they?}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{oh, all the great writers shakespeare, charles dickens, moby dick... those people. each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. it's a magnificent set and only $33.50 per volume. right away you get great expectations for just $6.99.}
<C>__{mumford }
<D>__{one hundred books?}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{it's irrelevant. it had nothing to do with what happened.}
<C>__{mumford }
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{althea is sitting on the couch facing mumford. she has a bulky knit cardigan sweater hugged tightly around her the only sign that she's not completely calm.}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{we argued on sunday. he went to work on monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. but on thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. didn't call either. not till saturday afternoon.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you must have been concerned.}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{it's happened before.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i'm shocked by how little i'm feeling. i can't understand it.}
<P>__{(a real question )}
<D>__{i will probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't i?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{doubtful. what did he say?}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{he said he wasn't coming back. he said it wasn't working for him any more. that it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... you know what i regret the most? i'm sorry i let him make the kids take his name. he was an acquirer.}
<P>__{(off mumford's look)}
<D>__{he liked to acquire things.}
<A>__{mumford looks away. althea realizes what he's thinking.}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{you think that has something to do with my problem? ordering all those things?...}
<A>__{it hadn't occurred to mumford, but it's an interesting thought.}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{...like i was on some kind of campaign to out acquire him...}
<P>__{(excited now, playing it out)}
<D>__{...if i was just an acquisition to him, and he lost interest once he had me }
<A>__{she stops, shakes her head.}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{that can't be it. it's too simple. and besides, i still like it. this morning i ordered a marble turtle cheese board from the horchow collection.}
<P>__{(an odd look)}
<D>__{can i tell you something just awful? you know how people who are just assholes will sometimes look at a woman who's got problems and say, "what she needs is a good shtupping!"?}
<A>__{mumford nods.}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{well, there may be something to that. jeremy didn't keep up his end oh, what difference does it make?}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{why do i feel elated? am i in denial? you know what it feels like?...}
<A>__{she glances at her watch, then starts talking fast }
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{i know my time's up, but i've got to get this out while i've got hold of it }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{take your time.}
<C>__{althea}
<P>__{(no slowing down)}
<D>__{ when i was in high school, the thing i wanted most, when i was stuck in class, the thing i was always desperately in pursuit of was a hall pass. that's all i wanted. i loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... and that's how i feel right now... like i have some giant, all day hall pass.}
<A>__{she is beaming, but suddenly becomes self conscious. she stands up abruptly, flushed.}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{my god, did it just get hot in here or what?}
<A>__{she takes off the bulky sweater and bends to pick up her purse. she is wearing a simple cotton dress that buttons up the front and hugs her body. we see for the first time what all her other outfits have hidden: althea has a terrific, voluptuous figure.}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{see you next time. i will probably be a basket case by then.}
<A>__{she heads toward the door to the waiting room. mumford indicates the back door.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you can go out there if you like...}
<C>__{althea}
<P>__{(quoting mumford)}
<D>__{"there's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, doc?}
<A>__{she opens the door to the waiting room, startling henry follett, who jumps up from a chair out there, magazine still in hand.}
