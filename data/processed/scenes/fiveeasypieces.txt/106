<B>__{favoring samia glavia}
<A>__{a friend of carl's. (somewhere under the following, the angle alters to include two other friends, as well as carl, catherine, bobby and rayette, seated around the living room, variously captive to her monologue.)}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{but the point is, man is born into the world with a pre existent adversary, both real and imaginary, so you'd have to say that aggression was one of his primary, psychic inheritances, which...}
<A>__{john fincher, a professorial type, attempts to interject:}
<C>__{fincher}
<D>__{if i may beg to differ...}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{beg all you like, john, but the fact remains that man takes enormous delight in aggressive acts, as well as the portrayal of aggressive acts, and to be triumphant over another no matter how, seems fundamental to his having a sense of well being, as well as...}
<C>__{fincher}
<D>__{no, i don't quarrel with your inference, but you draw too long a bow in your conclusions, which seem unnecessarily harsh and...}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{well, i don't make poetry. as an analyst, i...}
<A>__{rayette interrupts, calling across the room to carl:}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{is there a tv in the house?}
<A>__{carl starts to answer and is pre empted by samia:}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{john believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like i have and that view seems a little soporific. and not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{there's some good things on it, though.}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{pardon me?}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{the tv. there's some good things on it, sometimes.}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{i strongly doubt it, but i wasn't really discussing media...}
<C>__{fincher}
<D>__{if you really hold such bleak views, how can you, in good conscience, carry on a practice?}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{oh, there's always hope, i think, for a few individuals, if they're courageous enough to shed their illusions and their...}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(cutting her off)}
<D>__{and what about love?}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{what about it? wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{no, i wouldn't.}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{well, you're a romantic, catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...}
<B>__{on bobby}
<A>__{and his reaction as samia goes on:}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. but keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, samia...}
<A>__{she gets up and starts to move away.}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{but i'd like to say, so that i don't dampen the spirit of your adventure...}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(cutting her off)}
<D>__{you haven't dampened my spirit, samia... excuse me.}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{well, i should hope not...}
<A>__{she leaves the room, with bobby's eyes following her, and as carl moves over to sit beside rayette, samia resumes to fincher while the other friend moves in beside bobby and tries to engage him in conversation.}
<C>__{samia }
<D>__{because obviously there are loftier classes of people that do establish a kind of relating, that's}
<P>__{relatively free of... (etc.)}
<B>__{on carl and rayette}
<A>__{as she indicates tita's dog, lying near the fireplace.}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{what kind of doggy is that?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{it's a borzoi.}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{oh, uh huh. i had a little kittycat once, that bobby give me...}
<A>__{she calls across to bobby, interrupting samia.}
<C>__{rayette }
<D>__{remember, bobby?! the little pussycat you gave me?!}
<A>__{bobby, now feeling trapped by the other friend, looks across to her ass she returns her attention to carl.}
<C>__{rayette }
<D>__{she had four little white paws, an' oh, was i crazy over her. we hadda go an' leave her one time at some friends, an' she went out an' got smashed flatter'n a tortilla right outside their mobile home.}
<A>__{samia gestures toward rayette as if she were an example to prove her pointerior}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{there. you see what i mean?}
<A>__{bobby looks over at samia.}
<C>__{samia }
<D>__{the choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{well, she was.}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{perhaps...}
<A>__{she addresses fincher gesturing toward rayette again.}
<C>__{samia }
<D>__{but you see how close that is to what i'm trying to...}
<A>__{bobby stands up, cutting her off:}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{don't sit there pointing at her.}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{i beg your pardon.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(advancing on her)}
<D>__{i said, don't point at her like that! what gives you the right to sit there and tell anybody about class and who the hell's got it, and what she typifies! you shouldn't even be in the same room with her, you creep!}
<C>__{samia}
<D>__{carl, this is really too much...}

<P>__{(to samia)}
