<L>__{interior hotel room}
<A>__{next to the door, in the corner of the small, sparsely furnished room is macreedy's suitcase, open, its contents askew and scattered over the dusty floor. on the bed sprawls hector david, his gigantic body straining the springs. he lies on his back, hands clasped easily under his head, thick legs crossed, his stetson tilted over his low forehead. he is completely unconcerned by macreedy's entrance. for a moment macreedy stares at him. then...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(slightly amused)}
<D>__{i think you have the wrong room.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(not budging)}
<D>__{you think so?}
<A>__{slowly, his eyes still on macreedy, hector takes off his elaborate wrist watch and slides it gently into his pants pocket.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{what else you got on your mind?}
<A>__{macreedy pauses and takes in the situation. he refuses to be baited.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{nothing, i guess.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{if you had a mind, boy, you'd of heard what pete downstairs said. he said these here rooms are for us cowboys. for our every wish and comfort.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{and this, i guess, is yours?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{when i'm in town. and i'm in town, as any fool can see. you see that, don't you, boy?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i guess i do. would you mind very much if i sort of...}
<P>__{(he gestures toward}
<D>__{his suitcase and}
<P>__{clothing)}
<D>__{...clean up this mess and get another room?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{not at all. but if you want this room real bad...}
<P>__{(he raises his enormous}
<D>__{bulk to a sitting position, rubbing the knuckles of one big fist with the palm of his other}
<P>__{hand)}
<D>__{...we could maybe settle your claim without all this talk.}
<P>__{(no answer from macreedy)}
<D>__{if a man don't claim what's rightfully his'n, he's nuthin'. what do you think?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i guess so.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you guess so. but still you ain't claimin' this room?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i guess not.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you're all the time guessin', boy. don't you ever know anything?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{one thing i know. since i got off the train, i've been needled. why?}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(after a beat, slowly)}
<D>__{i guess i don't rightly know.}
<A>__{for a moment their eyes lock. then macreedy goes to his suitcase and throws his clothes in it. as he goes out the door...}
