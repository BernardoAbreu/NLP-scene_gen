<L>__{exterior mongibello. day.}
<A>__{ripley emerges from one of the beach cabins, and stands on the edge of the sand on a wooden walkway. he's wearing a tiny lime green bathing suit. he loathes beaches. a couple of boys turn laconically and watch him. ripley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea. he feels ridiculous, his skin alabaster against the brown bodies. finally, the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes and dashes to the water, where he luxuriates in the coolness of it before wading out of the sea, and walking straight up to dickie.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{dickie greenleaf?}
<A>__{dickie squints at ripley, who holds his shoes, lamely.}
<C>__{dickie}

<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{well, i knew you, so i suppose you must have known me.}
<C>__{dickie}
<P>__{(to marge)}
