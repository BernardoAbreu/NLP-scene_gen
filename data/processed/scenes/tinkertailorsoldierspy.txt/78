<L>__{exterior connie's house day}
<A>__{a large dilapidated victorian house. we hear the faint sound of voices and pop music coming from the garden. smiley pushes open the gate, walks down the path, past over grown shrubbery until he reaches the door with a bell marked "sachs." glancing sideways he is caught, entranced, by the sight of a young couple kissing in the window. they turn, suddenly aware of his presence and smiley, embarrassed, continues walking round the house. smiley's p.o.v. a group of students in togas are rehearsing a musical version of lysistrata. a young woman, holding her script, is miming to the song `don't' by doris. an older woman wearing rather too much make up is carrying a prop. this is connie sachs former queen of intelligence at the circus. she examines smiley for a moment, and then breaks into a charming smile. on smiley's expression this is not a social call. connie can't keep the disappointment from her face.}
