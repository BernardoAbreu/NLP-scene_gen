<L>__{interior whittlesley collection basement day}
<A>__{cuthbert flips on a light to see a tall, narrow space. stacks of metal shelves reach up into the gloom. everywhere we see spears, shields, masks, various artifacts. ancient tribal costumes lie shrouded in plastic like corpses against the walls. and in the middle of the gloom, sitting ominously in the light of a sole hanging bulb are... the whittlesley crates. the same ones last seen in the hold of the ill fated santa lucia. they are scattered about in disarray. one in particular has been broken open, its contents spread on the floor. cuthbert mutters in surprise and dismay, kneels by the crate.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{no, it can't be.}
<A>__{cuthbert feels gently through the packing material, lets out a sigh of relief as he pulls out a figurine. it is a small, beautifully carved statue of a monster crouched on all fours. the room falls totally silent as cuthbert studies the relic. it's a truly frightening piece... massive, razor sharp claws, large round nostrils, enormous teeth and red rimmed eyes. suddenly cuthbert sees a drop of blood on his hand! he's been cut!}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{damn.}
<A>__{cuthbert rises, shakes his finger in pain. blood drips on the floor. he pulls out his pocket handkerchief and wraps the wound. the handkerchief rapidly soaks through. suddenly a hand clamps on cuthbert's shoulder! he's not alone! he lets out a yelp, almost dropping the relic and spins to see... a museum guard standing behind him. his nameplate reads... beauregard. he's a gentle young fellow with white blond hair and a rolling southern accent.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{beauregard! you scared me half to death.}
<C>__{beauregard}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir. you okay?}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{someone broke into this room.}
<C>__{beauregard}
<D>__{anything missin'?}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{doesn't look like it. we're damned lucky. this statue is priceless.}
<A>__{cuthbert holds up the relic of the monster. beauregard stares.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{mbwun. a south american warrior deity. he carries a powerful curse. every member of the expedition that found this statue, died.}
<A>__{beauregard sees cuthbert's cut finger.}
<C>__{beauregard}
<D>__{looks like the curse is still at work.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{the claws are sharp... i must have cut myself.}
<P>__{(uneasy laugh)}
<D>__{better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.}
<A>__{beauregard studies the door as cuthbert heads out with the figurine.}
<C>__{beauregard}
<D>__{don't know if it'll do any good, mr. cuthbert.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{beauregard}
<D>__{no one broke into this room, sir. someone broke out. that lock was torn off from the inside.}
<A>__{cuthbert glances at the evil face of mbwun, pales. as he exits, hold on beauregard, left alone with the crates.}
