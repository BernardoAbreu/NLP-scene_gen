<L>__{exterior bungalow #86 afternoon (sixth period; next day)}
<A>__{the windows and blinds are shut now.}
<L>__{interior bungalow #86 clock on wall continuous action}
<A>__{is inching toward the top of the hour. closing their books and loading their knapsacks, the students talk and pay more attention to the inexorable march of time than to trevor writing on an overhead projector.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{okay, someone tell me the difference between the central nervous system and the lymphatic system?}
<A>__{rita nartinez (the chola from the "utility" shed) sits near the front of the class. she wears her usual heavy eyeliner and a new nose ring.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(obscenely)}
<D>__{mr. g, you gotta nice butt.}
<A>__{class erupts. rita enjoys the attention. trevor turns and looks at her squarely.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{you seem to be an expert on anatomy, miss }
<P>__{(checks roster)}
<D>__{ nartinez. central nervous system and lymphatic system. what's the difference?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{... uh...}
<A>__{trevor doesn't expect anything remotely close to the right answer.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{it's like the central nervous system, that's your brain and spinal cord, and the lymphatic system, that's the stuff in your blood that fights diseases.}
<A>__{a beat. trevor looks up at her.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{very good.}
<A>__{trevor notices cesar sanchez writing on his desk. stevie cranes his neck to observe. paco snoozes.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{cesar.}
<A>__{cesar throws back his head and jerks both hands from his desk top. trevor walks up the aisle.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{you writing on your desk?}
<C>__{cesar}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{you see anything in my hands?}
<P>__{(displaying his empty palms)}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{trevor looks down at the tagging on cesar's desktop. in one corner are the letters k o s, and below that the word "cartoon."}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{k o s, what's that? that a tagging crew?}
<A>__{cesar shrugs with a big grin.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{cartoon... is that you, cesar?}
<P>__{(off no response)}
<D>__{'k o s' has something to do with your friend benny?}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{... dawg. you're a sucker. k o s stands for 'kappin' off suckers.' don't disrespect my homeboy, benny. he don't like it. he don't like you.}
<A>__{trevor dismisses cesar's comments.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{do me a favor, cesar. go get a paper towel from the counter and wipe off your desk.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and mr. littleton, please oblige me and turn that tagger shirt inside out.}
<A>__{stevie wears a fusion t shirt emblazoned with a giant spray can.}
<C>__{stevie}
<P>__{(refusing)}
<D>__{hyland said it was okay, sucker.}
<A>__{neither of them budge. momentous deliberation. now the bell rings and the classroom empties in a matter of seconds. cesar stares daggers at trevor as he exits. rita hangs back, the last one to leave. she doesn't want anyone to see her talking to trevor.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(self conscious)}
<D>__{don't pay no attention to them. they jus' tryin' tuh fuck wit' you, mr. g. i mean play wit' you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sorry i said you had a nice ass.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(a pensive beat)}
<D>__{... apology accepted.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(in her own defense)}
<D>__{i ain't no school girl.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{god forbid anyone should think that.}
<A>__{rita flickers an awkward smile, turns and exits. the class empties and trevor is left staring at the empty desks where benny and cesar sat... whack trevor's reverie is broken by a basketball smashing against the side of the bungalow. pov out the window a group of boys grin mischieviously at the reaction they get from trevor... continue smashing the ball against bungalows.}
<B>__{trevor}
<A>__{shifts his gaze from them to the venetian blinds framing the window... to the clock over his desk.}
