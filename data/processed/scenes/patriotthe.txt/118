<A>__{tarleton lounges in the grass on a slope in front of a farmhouse, looking out at a lovely sunset, absentmindedly picking at the petals of some wildflowers. a hideous scream pierces the calm. tarleton analytically evaluates the tenor of the scream, then rises, passing several green dragoons who wait with their horses in front of the farmhouse.}

<D>__{i believe they are almost ready.}
<B>__{in the farmhouse}
<A>__{blood is smeared on one wall, where half a dozen corpses lie in a jumbles mass on the floor. in the parlor, tarleton walks past more bodies, including a dead woman who lies protectively but ineffectually over the bloody bodies of her two young children, both under eight years old. in the kitchen, tarleton finds wilkins, some green dragoons, and gaskins, the loyalist militia commander and some of his low life men. rob fielding, one of the craftsmen in marion's force, is tied, spread eagle to the table, showing the terrible effects of protracted torture. wilkins and gaskins are nervous and apologetic as tarleton walks into the room.}

<D>__{i'm sorry, sir. he died.}
<A>__{tarleton sighs, irritated.}
<C>__{tarleton}
<D>__{very well, get one of the others.}
<A>__{gaskins and a couple of his men step into an attached woodshed where billings sits, bound. they roughly grab him and drag him into the kitchen.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{damn your eyes. do your worst.}
<C>__{tarleton}
<D>__{i intend to.}
<A>__{they tie billings to the table.}
