<L>__{exterior a house in the hollywood hills night}
<A>__{the view of downtown los angeles from the enormous, ornate house is extraordinary. a small outdoor dinner party is in progress. a magician is entertaining guests. playing cards and coins appear and disappear in his nimble hands.}
<L>__{interior house study night}
<D>__{edward harris stands at the window, impassively looking down}
<A>__{at the party. edward is a handsome, well groomed man of around forty. he looks tired; the kind of fatigue that can't be cured by a night's sleep.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(a murmur)}
<D>__{left pocket.}
<A>__{and indeed, down below, the magician pulls the coin from the left pocket of the incredulous woman's silk blazer. more laughter and applause. the study is in keeping with the rest of the house. luxurious. everything the best. william stuckey, edward's contemporary, is a crafty looking lawyer who is the party host. vance is an investment banker. his assistant jake, is a financial researcher. the other men are investment bankers. they are in dark suits and power ties. on the table are stacks of documents and folders, the name "kross industries" is prominent on many of the folders.}
<C>__{investment banker 1}
<D>__{our banks certainly doesn't want to discourage harris enterprises from investing in california. we think this is a great new venue for you but you've got to understand the mergers and acquisitions market is changing. with the upswing in inflation we have to make these offerings tempting to offset the risk.}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{look, we're talking about hard assets and a straight liquidation. we have over a thousand man hours in this deal.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<P>__{(losing patience)}
<D>__{this is a "no brainer". there's no risk for you. no one has ever lost money backing mr. harris.}
<C>__{investment banker 2}
<D>__{not yet. but ship building is a new endeavor for you...}
<C>__{stuckey}
<P>__{(cuts him off)}
<D>__{come on. you know we're not going to go into ship building. besides, you're the ones with the troubled track record, not us!}
<C>__{investment banker 3}
<D>__{bill, be reasonable. if you're really going to digest kross industries that quickly eighteen should not be such a problem. besides, i don't think there's anywhere else you can go for the money in the time you have.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{it's unacceptable.}
<A>__{edward turns from the window. he hasn't miss a thing. all eyes are on him.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{draymen heux has offered me seventy five in the pool at sixteen and a half. i can secure the other half personally. you have until tomorrow morning to make me a better offer.}
<A>__{the bankers speechlessly stare at him.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{the meeting is over, gentlemen.}
<A>__{he turns away. the bankers look at one another. they rise. silence as they exit. when the door closes. stuckey explodes with laughter.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{hah! did you see the look on their faces?}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{you don't think we pushed too hard?}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{no way! they'll come back. they can't afford not to. edward, that bluff was beautiful.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{maybe i should have made it rhyme.}
<A>__{the others stare at him, uncertain. stuckey laughs. the others follow suit.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(looking at his watch)}
<D>__{well! it's late. we've been at this long enough.}
<A>__{stuckey rises. edward ushers vance and jake toward the door.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{gentlemen, enjoy the party. the magician's wonderful.}
<A>__{vance and jake exit.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(calling after them)}
<D>__{watch your left pocket.}
<A>__{a butler has entered the room.}
<C>__{butler}
<D>__{phone call, mr. harris. it's miss charles.}
<C>__{stuckey}
<D>__{cynthia? is she coming out?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{we're about to find out. go on. take care of your guests.}
<A>__{stuckey exits the room as edward crosses to the telephone.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{where are you, cynthia?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i see.}
<P>__{(pausing, getting angry)}
<D>__{no, i don't expect you to be at my beck and call. are you coming or not?}
