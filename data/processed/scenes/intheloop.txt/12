<C>__{simon}
<D>__{come on, malcolm, he asked me for a personal opinion.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{oh why didn't you say? i mean, he asked you. fuck. of course, that explains it. yeah. say, if he'd asked you to fucking black up, or give him your pin number, or shot yourself, would you have done that as well.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i would have blacked up. it was the radio and no one would have known.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{yeah. very good.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{but war is basically unforeseeable isn't it?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{that is not our line, alright? walk the fucking line. look.}
<P>__{(mor e)}
<C>__{mal colm }
<D>__{we've got karen clark over from washington, okay? we've got the us national security advisor's main guy coming. yeah? we've got enough pentagon goons here for a fucking coup d'etat. this is not the time to send out a signal like this in some personal fucking sodcast.}
<A>__{judy and toby come in.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{minister, this is toby.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{not the time love. fuck off.}
<A>__{judy smiles at malcolm, and doesn't fuck off.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{hey toby. glad you could join us. bit of an odd morning, but 'welcome to the madhouse!'i apologise for malcolm.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{don't apologise for me. you should apologise for yourself.}
<P>__{(to judy)}
<D>__{did i not just tell you to fuck off and yet you're still here?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{that's correct.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(to toby)}
<D>__{hey, foetus boy. lesson one: if i tell you to fuck off what do you do?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{fuck off?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you'll go far.now fuck off.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{toby fucks off. we can see him outside, wandering around, not knowing what to do with himself.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{we were thinking, weren't we judy, that i could row back on question time tonight.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{no, you're not going on question time tonight. you've been disinvited.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{why? we've been prepping question time.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{because they ask fucking questions on question time. and you're no good at questions. if it was fumbling, off message shit fucking answer time, you'd be our main guy. but it's not.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{sorry, why wasn't i told about this?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{why should i tell you about this?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{because it's a scheduled media appearance by this department's secretary of state and it therefore falls within my purview...}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{your purview? where do you think you are sweetheart, in some regency costume drama? this is a government department, not a fucking jane austen novel. allow me to pop a jaunty little bonnet on your purview and ram it up the shitter with a lubricated horse cock.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{malcolm, your swearing doesn't impress me. my husband works for tower hamlets and believe me, those kids make you sound like angela lansbury.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(to simon, lads' chat)}
<D>__{she's married? the poor bastard.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{but...okay, judy's lubricated horse cock aside for one moment....}
<P>__{(judy walks out)}
<D>__{are you saying that i'm now not allowed to make any media appearances?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{no, not until we can trust you to keep to the line.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{but i was going to keep to the line: "i don't actually think war is unforeseeable."}
<A>__{malcolm's looking out of the office, monitoring judy's movements. she's flashed up on his radar. he's tracking her.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what is it then?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{is it...i don't know? foreseeable? no.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{no. not foreseeable. that's fucking declaring war. do you want to fucking declare war?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i'm a cabinet minister. i didn't get here by screwing up every media appearance i ever had.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{write this down. it's neither forseeable nor undorseeable.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{right. so not inevitable, but not...evitable.}
<A>__{malcolm leaves the office. toby is still hovering.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(calling back to simon)}
<D>__{okay, you need to work on this fucking line.}
<P>__{(to judy)}
<D>__{that includes you, jane fucking austen with the strap on. oh, and put the sniff out there that the next time the bbc ambushes a minister with a war question we'll drop a bomb on them.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i can't do that. that's political, that's not in my...}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{purview, marie antoinette? weel listen, darling, why don't you fucking scuttle off back to fucking cranford and play around with your tea and cake and horse cocks. let them eat cock! (to toby) you, ron weasley you do it.}
<A>__{malcolm heads out.}
