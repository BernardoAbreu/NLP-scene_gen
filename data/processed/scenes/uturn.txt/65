<A>__{crowbar in one hand, bobby makes his way slowly through the living room, banging against the edge of a table. he hops silently in pain, then waits at the door to the next room and listens. hearing nothing he slowly pokes his head into the darkness. a moment later bobby backs from the door and we see the barrel of his own black .9mm baretta pressed against his forehead. jake appears now, backing him into the living room. he switches on a lamp.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{well, well. as i live and breathe. i didn't expect to be seeing the like of you again. thought you'd be long on your way by now.}
<A>__{jake continues to press the gun to bobby's head.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that's my gun...(then) that fucking darrell!}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i like darrell. he may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. we own harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{you been workin' me the whole time.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i guess this is what they call "ironee"? hunh?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{it's not what you think, jake.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{no, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and i'm telling sheriff potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. and darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{wait a minute. just listen to me...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{...and he thought he'd clock old jake mckenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{that's not the reason i'm here, jake.}
