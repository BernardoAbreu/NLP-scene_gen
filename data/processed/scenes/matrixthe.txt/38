<A>__{neo wakes up from a deep sleep, feeling better. he is wearing a black tank top and shorts. he begins to examine himself. there is a futuristic iv plugged into the jack in his forearm. he pulls it out, staring at the grafted outlet. he feels his bald head. his fingers find and explore the large outlet in the base of his skull. just as he starts to come unglued, morpheus opens the door.}

<D>__{morpheus, what's happened to me? what is this place?}
<C>__{morpheus}

<C>__{neo}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{you believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197. i can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.}
<A>__{the wind is knocked from neo's chest.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{that's not possible.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{i promised you the truth, neo, and the truth is that the world you were living in was a lie.}
<C>__{neo}

<C>__{morpheus}
