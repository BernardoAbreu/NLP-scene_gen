<A>__{men in tuxedos and women in gowns. mr. brooks is seated at one of the front tables with his wife, emma, also 40's. the audience's hands are coming together for what a man at the microphone has just said. mr. brooks is smiling but not clapping; and although his lips don't move we can hear:}
<C>__{mr. brooks }
<P>__{(even faster now)}
<D>__{... taking, as he did, this sinful world as it is, not as i would have it. trusting that he will make all things right if i surrender to his will. that i may be reasonably happy in this life, and supremely happy with him forever in the nexterior amen.}

<C>__{man}
<D>__{i could go on and on about what a great guy earl is, how he cuts his toe nails...}
<A>__{everyone laughs.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{... how he gives freely of his time and money, but let's get earl up here to speak for himself. ladies and gentlemen, i give you a businessman, a philanthropist, a great friend and the evanston chamber of commerce man of the year... mr. earl brooks.}

<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{thank you all very much. the first thing i would like to say is... i don't even know how i cut my toe nails.}

<A>__{mr. brooks doesn't rise to the bait.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{well she missed a good party...}
<A>__{as she continues, we look at mr. brooks and emma's voice fades to a murmur. in the back seat, a man leans out from behind mr. brooks's head. this is marshall. he's 50 plus. emma can neither see nor hear him. marshall exists only in mr. brooks's mind.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{come on, earl, give yourself a break, you know you want to do this.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{you're the fucking 'man of the year', you deserve it. it's not like it's not set up. you already know how to by pass the alarm, you know how to pick the locks. tonight's the perfect night.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(over his shoulder)}
<D>__{no, marshall, i said 'no'!}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{i heard you, earl, but you don't mean 'no'.}
<A>__{emma feels mr. brooks's distance.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<A>__{mr. brooks pulls himself back into the moment.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{you were frowning.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i was thinking of what i didn't say in the speech.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{they laughed, they were touched, i don't think anyone felt left out.}
<C>__{marshall}
<P>__{(from the back seat)}
<D>__{they have their dance class tonight. what if we go by and just look at them. there's no harm in just having a look.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{no means 'no', marshall.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{please... pretty please.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(to emma)}
<D>__{the food tonight was very good, but i wasn't crazy about the dessert. would you like to stop somewhere and get something sweet?}
<L>__{interior ice cream parlor n night}
<A>__{in a booth, mr. brooks and emma are sharing a sundae. mr. brooks steals a look at the arthur murray dance class that is taking place behind the full length windows fronting the second floor of the building across the street.}

<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{the pound's a pretty sad place; if you want me to, i will go with you.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{there's an irish lab i read about, and i think the breeder is...}
<A>__{mr. brooks turns his attention back to the dancers and again emma's voice fades to a murmur. both mr. brooks and marshall who is seated on the other side of emma are focused on one particular couple. the man and woman are not great dancers nor are they especially attractive, but mr. brooks and marshall are fascinated with them. marshall leans forward and looking slyly around emma at mr. brooks:}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{i bet your dick's getting hard, isn't it, just imagining what they would look like dead?}
<A>__{savoring the ice cream, mr. brooks nods.}

<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{through the door of the dressing area, emma can be seen taking off her evening clothes. hidden by the darkness on the other side of the bed, mr. brooks is hunched forward on a chair, his head in his hands. his bow tie is undone, but he's still wearing his tuxedo. in obvious torment, he is whispering to himself.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{... i can't do this, i can't do this, i can't do this, please don't let me do this, god grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change...}
<A>__{in the dressing area emma is putting on her sleep wear. mr. brooks steps into the doorway.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i'm going to stay up a while, maybe go to the studio and play with some glazes.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{okay, i'm going to read. if i'm not awake, wake me when you come back.}
<A>__{mr. brooks comes forward, puts his arms around emma and hugs her, then easing back, kisses her.}

<D>__{don't do this, don't do this, please don't do this, don't do this, don't do, please don't do this...}
<A>__{he passes through a screen of trees and arrives at a small beautiful industrial looking building. no windows except for a narrow strip on three sides just under the edge of the roof. mr. brooks lets himself in with a key.}
<L>__{interior building n night}
<A>__{exquisitely unique handmade handglazed bowls, vases, cups, plates are scattered haphazardly on shelves and tables around the room. this is mr. brooks's ceramics studio. mr. brooks turns on the big industrial kiln and sets the temperature, then in a series of quick cuts changes out of his tuxedo into his work clothes which he selects from a dozen identical pairs of khaki shirts and pants hanging in a closet. below the pants and shirts are a dozen pairs of identical leather work shoes. the windbreaker he puts on is also from a dozen identical windbreakers. he takes a set of car keys off a hook next to a door which opens into a garage. under the light is an older model non descript toyota.}
<L>__{exterior ceramics studio n night}
<A>__{the toyota backs into an alley and with the garage door closing behind it, pulls away.}
<L>__{interior toyota n night}
<A>__{marshall is up front with mr. brooks.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{oh lordy, earl my boy, i've missed this! we are going to have so much fun!}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{this is the last time, marshall. understand me?! the very last time!}
<L>__{exterior residential street n night}
<A>__{a mixture of modest houses and apartment buildings. mr. brooks's toyota is parked in the semi dark cast by a tree. we rise over the car, over the trees, over the houses to the other side of the block and come down to find mr. brooks working the lock on the side door of a small bungalow. he has on surgical gloves. the pick is extracted, the handle turned. the door opens. there's a chain. mr. brooks removes a pair of bent rubber tipped forceps from a pocket, inserts it in the chain, pulls the door to, gives the tool a twist and gently pushes the door inward. the chain has been released.}
<L>__{interior bungalow n night}
<A>__{mr. brooks quietly closes the door and holding his breath stands very still and listens. there's a faint indistinct sound coming from the recesses of the house. mr. brooks's feet glide out of the pantry. now coming slightly behind him is another pair of legs encased in dark slacks. move up; the person in the black slacks is marshall. in the middle of the kitchen, the sound is now recognizable. it's the moans of a couple fucking. this disturbs mr. brooks, he hesitates. marshall leans in and hisses fiercely in his ear.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{don't you dare quit on me, you piece of shit. i want to see what they're doing.}
<A>__{mr. brooks's spine stiffens and he's going forward again. entering a hallway, he reaches into his jacket. when his hand reappears it's inside a ziplock bag, his fingers around the butt of a silenced pistol. he brings the hand and bag to his mouth and tightens the ziplock against his wrist. the two men arrive at a door that's slightly ajar. behind it the sounds of the love making are becoming more intense. mr. brooks nudges the door with his foot. it opens enough for he and marshall to see the couple inside. the man and woman from the arthur murray dance class are naked on the bed. as much as mr. brooks hates himself for it he loves watching. he can now hear his heart beating in his ears. he begins to breathe in unison with the couple, but his expression is distant almost clinical. when the couple climaxes, when they come, mr. brooks's face goes blank. on the bed the woman rolls off her partner and the two of them lie there basking in the afterglow. behind them mr. brooks pushes the door fully open and slips into the room. they don't know he's there until he speaks.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{both the man and woman jump with surprise and look. the woman screams and scrabbles at the sheet to cover herself.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{what the fuck?!}
<A>__{then he sees the gun.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hey, man, don't...}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(to the woman)}
<D>__{be quiet and sit up.}
<A>__{in an attempt to get away, the woman pushes herself back against the wall. she can't take her eyes off mr. brooks and she can't stop screaming. pop! a hole appears above her left eye. the impact of mr. brooks's high velocity .22 slug bounces her head off the wall. the screaming stops. the man opens his mouth and begins to shake. pop! the bullet through his brain makes him instantly dead and he crumples onto the girl. mr. brooks looks at what he's done. his nostrils flare at the scent of death. then he moves, he's got work to do. on his way to the bed, the pistol goes into his pocket.}
<C>__{marshall }
<P>__{(barks)}
<D>__{whoa, earl, what the fuck is this?!!}
<A>__{mr. brooks snaps a look. the curtains of the bedroom window are open; and over half of the apartments in a four story building on the other side of an alley can see into this room. most of their windows are dark. and there's no one looking out of the windows that are lit.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{these pigs liked to fuck with the blinds open, you should have known that, earl. this is a big mistake for you, earl.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(going to the window)}
<D>__{almost like i want to get caught, huh, marshall?}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{well, don't fucking do that. i don't think either of us would enjoy spending the rest of our lives in jail or a lethal injection.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{he grabs a side of cloth in either hand and yanks the curtains closed.}

<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{please forgive me... please forgive me...}
<A>__{as we look closer at the photographs we realize by a smear of blood here and there and the distortion of the limbs that these tableaus were arranged after the couple was killed. one by one, mr. brooks picks up his souvenirs. he lingers over the last image; and from where he's sitting on the edge of a table:}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{don't even think about it. you know the rules.}
<A>__{reluctantly mr. brooks throws the polaroids into the fire of the kiln.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{now go up and make love to your beautiful wife.}
<A>__{he leaves. in the kiln, the polaroids burst into flame.}
<L>__{exterior murder house n afternoon}
<A>__{the sunlight exposes its charm. if it weren't for the police tape, the uniformed officers, and the plainclothes detectives, it looks like it would be a cool place to live. an older detective, an african american, comes out on the porch and calls to two other detectives who are drinking coffee on the lawn:}
<C>__{older detective}
<D>__{where the fuck is atwood?!}
<C>__{young detective}
<D>__{i called ten minutes ago, they said she was on her way.}

<A>__{special detective tracy atwood, somewhere in her 30's, is behind the wheel. the door is open. by the expression on her face we might guess that detective atwood has simply forgotten to get out of the car. on the seat next to her is a copy of the chicago tribune. the headline of a middle article on the first page reads: the}

<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{where are the thumbprints?}

<D>__{it's darker tonight than it was on your night. but still how did you manage not to bump into the furniture? did you have a little light? that would be too dangerous. i will bet you were in the house before.}
<C>__{detective atwood }
<D>__{so i should ask the neighbors if they saw a meter reader around the house or a telephone repairman or someone from the gas company.}
<A>__{these musings take her through the living room to the entrance of the hallway where she pauses and looks both ways.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{once again, how did you know where they were? did you check the rooms before you found them? she had his semen in her vagina, they had just made love, did you hear them or was there a light on?}
<A>__{she steps into the hall.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{and when did you bag the gun? because even though i'm sure you're an expert at it, there's still a chance of noise from the plastic.}
<A>__{she continues down the hall to the bedroom.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{was the door open or did you have to open it?}
<A>__{she opens the door and goes in.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{were they asleep or awake? was the light on, or did you turn it on? because i know you, you wouldn't risk a shot in the dark.}
<A>__{she turns on the overhead light.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{too bright. what if it wasn't that light that was on, but this one?}
<A>__{she turns on a bedside light and goes back to the door and turns off the overhead. if the dance couple were on the bed and their blood was not on the wall, the room would look exactly the way it did when mr. brooks said 'hello'.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{that's better... what thrill do you get by killing people? is it sexual, is it hate, is it power? do you feel remorse? probably that part of your brain doesn't exist. do you have emotions of love or affection or joy? or have you learned to fake them so you won't stand out in a crowd.}
<A>__{she's at the window now, feeling the curtains.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{what if these are stuck closed because you yanked them closed? which means they were open when you came into the room.}
<A>__{she separates the fabric and looks out the rain streaked window at the four story building across the alley. there are lights on in almost all the apartment windows.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{if mr. and miss normal made love with the curtains open and the lights on, someone in that building noticed them and may have seen you.}

<L>__{exterior sidewalk n morning}
<A>__{atwood strides toward her car. the pedestrian traffic is light. it's too early for the stores to be open. up ahead a brown van is idling at the curb, the sliding side door is open. atwood can see inside. empty except for some furniture blankets. the person in the driver's seat turns to look into the back. it's the woman who was watching atwood outside the murder house. her hands are unseen in leather gloves. she looks up and their eyes meet. two strangers. the contact is instantly broken. atwood takes a deep breath and smiles. after the rain, the air is brisk and clean. it's good to be alive. slam!!! atwood is body checked by a man who springs out of the recess of a doorway. his arms wrap around her, she's lifted off her feet and the man throws himself and her into the van.}
<L>__{interior brown van morning}
<A>__{oooff!! the wind is knocked out of atwood when she lands left shoulder first on the furniture blankets, the man on top of her. the man is thorton meeks, the hangman, six feet, a solid two hundred pounds. he's also wearing tight leather gloves.}

<C>__{meeks}
<D>__{i already know where i'm gonna hang you. but first i'm gonna watch her...}
<P>__{(indicates the driver)}
<D>__{... have some fun with you, then she's gonna watch me have some fun with you.}
<A>__{he kisses her again and puts the gun to atwood's head.}
<C>__{meeks}
<D>__{now, don't move.}
<A>__{he raises up and straddles her.}
<C>__{meeks}
<D>__{you know the drill, i'm gonna put the cuffs on.}
<A>__{with his left hand he fishes a pair of handcuffs from a back pocket and snaps them on atwood's right wrist.}
<C>__{meeks}
<D>__{now the left.}
<A>__{he rolls atwood on her back and with the chain of the handcuff pulls her right arm toward her left. all meeks' talk has allowed atwood to catch her breath and suddenly she jerks her head up into the gun and screams at the top of her lungs.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{shoot me!!!}
<A>__{at the same time she pulls hard against the handcuff with her right wrist. a startled meeks is thrown off balance. the gun comes away from atwood's head. her left arm now free, atwood swings her palm with all of her might into meeks' right ear. pop!! his eardrum breaks. aaaggh!! he instinctually reaches to cover the damaged ear with his gun hand. the driver doubles around to see what's happening. from outside, hoonnnkk!! the driver's attention returns to the road. atwood swings again. this time she snags the barrel of the gun and using it as a lever bends meeks' hand back on the wrist. blam! the gun goes off. neither one of them is hit. at the same time atwood pulls hard on the handcuff that meeks is holding in his left hand and twists into him. this dislodges meeks and he's off of her. snarling like animals they fight for the gun. crack! atwood's leverage breaks meeks' trigger finger. his grip loosens on the weapon. she pulls it out of his hand. a quick push skitters it across the floor. it drops through the open side door into the street. atwood rolls away and reaches for her ankle gun. now it's meeks' turn. a sharp tug on the chain of the handcuff stalls her motion. he flicks his other arm and a switchblade is delivered into his right hand. snap!! the blade comes out. atwood is reaching again for her ankle gun. she sees the flash of metal and flings her head back. luckily all she receives is a deep gash above her right eye. blood immediately begins to cascade over her brow. meeks grins and gives another sharp tug on the handcuff to pull atwood into the range of his knife. with one foot atwood kicks at him, with the other she pushes off and propels herself backward to grab a handful of the driver's hair. atwood's weight hinges the driver's head back until she's looking at the ceiling. her scream is equal parts pain and surprise.}

<A>__{the brown van veers into the on coming traffic. the driver of the car dead ahead swerves. the van solidly clips the rear of that car.}
<L>__{interior brown van morning}
<A>__{the sudden deceleration of that impact slingshots atwood and meeks forward. she hits the back of the driver's seat. meeks has further to go. he loses his hold on the handcuffs and smashes into the passenger seat. her right hand now free, atwood scratches for the gun on her hip.}
<L>__{exterior street n morning}
<A>__{careening across its lane, the van sideswipes a parked car.}
<L>__{interior brown van n morning}
<A>__{that impact rips atwood's hand out of the driver's hair and sends her sliding on her knees toward the side door. on her way she unclips her gun and is bringing it out of her holster when meeks who has managed to hang onto the passenger seat sees this and slams a foot into her chest. atwood is launched backward out the side door.}
<L>__{exterior street n morning}
<A>__{in slow motion atwood flies through the air while at normal speed the van is leaving her behind. smash! butt first, atwood hammers into the back window of a parked car. the shattering glass breaks her fall. groggily she rolls out of the indentation. gun still in hand and blood covering one side of her face she slides off the car to stand in the street. the van is nowhere in sight.}

<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{maybe i was a little abrupt back there, but let me explain. finding someone you think would be fun to kill is a bit like falling in love. you meet a lot of candidates, and you like some of them and they're nice, but they're not right; and then that special one shows up and your heart beats faster and you know that's the one. the man in the pickup did not make my heart beat faster.}
