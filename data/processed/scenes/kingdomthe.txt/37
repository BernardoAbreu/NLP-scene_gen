<L>__{interior command & tactical operations center (ctoc) next}
<B>__{moment}
<A>__{fleury enters, steps to a podium, opens his folder. 50 agents seated lecture hall style. steam from fifth, sixth cups of coffee. plasma screens behind show still images of the crime cribbed from al jazeera. throughout the scene, fleury constantly refers to a roster of his erts.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{numbers so far: 100+ dead, 200+ injured. the target was a softball game. rumor is the killers wore saudi police uniforms.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{special agent fran manner was killed.}
<A>__{janet mayes, 29 years old, stifles a sob in the front row. fleury steps from behind the podium, puts a hand gently on janet's shoulder, leans in and whispers something no one but janet hears. whatever his words, they give back her composure. she nods.}
<C>__{ronald fleury }
<D>__{so was rex burr from state.}
<A>__{fleury lets the news absorb as he steps back to the podium. no one says a thing. fleury lifts his eyes again, real trouble maintaining control...}
<C>__{ronald fleury }
<D>__{fran was the best among us...we'll feel this loss the rest of our days...}
<P>__{(beat, moment to regroup)}
<D>__{grant, take stabs at bomb sizes.}
<A>__{grant sykes. 50 years old. virginia state trooper before joining the fbi. law and order formidable: sharp smart charlottesville accent. studies the images for a beat...}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{from the craters, looks like they used a high explosive... possibly military grade: can't fit that much tnt into a vest. 20, 30 pounds of petn: they got it. semtex or c 4: they could get it. the third there, god knows...that crater looks like a plane dropped a 500 pounder...}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{obviously a secondary blast after the initial devices used to lure first responders to the scene. don't know anything about where or what it was yet.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{this is how they do it.}
<A>__{adam leavitt. 34 years old, sought after investigator. there's a constant, intense grind to this guy, a mind and mouth incapable of quiet. he paces around the room, then eagle eyes the bomb images... starts surge scrawling crude diagrams of the blast site on a piece of loose leaf. feels more like nervous doodling than work. not looking up from his drawing:}
<C>__{adam leavitt}
<D>__{i already know the answer, but any chance in hell we get to go over there, use our hands?}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{if you already know the answer adam, why ask the question?}
<A>__{fleury circles leavitt's name on the roster. leavitt never stops drawing.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{we're not seeing this kind of planning and execution anywhere else...these ain't hot wired artillery shells waiting for humvees to roll by.}
<P>__{(pointing at the screens)}
<D>__{these hits are coordinated: planning, timing, and big, broad daylight balls }
<C>__{janet mayes}
<P>__{(almost trance studying the images)}
<D>__{yeah, so... did they all happen during daylight?}
<A>__{another great question. fleury looks over to agent #1 on his immediate right, an egg head type with a big binder in front of him. everyone's eyes follow. agent #1 flips quickly through the binder, back and forth, searching. fleury crosses his name off of his roster. then:}
<D>__{agent #1 yes. at least the first parts of the attacks.}
<A>__{everyone smells it: that's big more proof these attacks are being carried out by one, very skilled terror cell.}
<C>__{janet mayes}
<D>__{we had two others...north of riyadh and the oil thing. what was that?}
<C>__{adam leavitt}
<D>__{the refinery... ras tenura refinery.}
<C>__{janet mayes}
<D>__{yeah, south of jeddah. same thing: daylight, suicide bombers. right?}
<C>__{janet mayes }
<D>__{same thing. followed by machine gun crews. collect and kill.}
<C>__{adam leavitt}
<D>__{yup.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{this is not new in concept. it is new in scope. it's bigger. very sophisticated. command and control was flawless. they found the largest kill zone they could and they did it... they did it by being patient.}
<C>__{adam leavitt}
<D>__{any rumors or confirmations of uniforms being used in the other two attacks?}
<A>__{fleury circles mayes' name on the ert roster.}
<D>__{agent #1}
<P>__{(from memory)}
<D>__{no. i know this is the first for that.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{that's `worst case scenario' if you're still asking for my stab, sir. a crew who can build bombs this big, with this level of eyes on control and detonation coordination... has access to saudi uniforms now...i mean...baby jesus.}
<C>__{leavitt}
<D>__{anyone take credit?}
<A>__{fleury checks from his notes.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{abu hamza. saudi al qaeda. bin laden wanna be. we know he was in afghanistan, then moved to iraq. now he seems to have come home. he's clearly becoming increasingly active...}
<C>__{adam leavitt}
<D>__{if it is hamza, he's definitely turning up the volume over there.}
<C>__{adam leavitt }
<D>__{not to beat a dead horse, sir, but if there was ever a time to get boots on saudi sand...}
<A>__{sykes studies leavitt with what is best described as substantial skepticism. fleury circles sykes' name on his roster.}
<C>__{janet mayes}
<D>__{they can't afford to appear as if they are losing any kind of control. they lose control over their country, their people...then they risk losing control over the oil. they won't let us in. no way.}
<A>__{fleury's p.o.v.: his open folder on the podium. a memo printed on department of state letterhead. pulls the memo, reads it aloud, calm laced with rage.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{from the state department, one hour ago: `we are in agreement with the saudi security assessment that any additional american presence on kingdom soil represents reckless risk. therefore it is the secretary of state's position that only after the situation has been evaluated and contained, should the federal bureau of investigation activate rapid deployment.'}
<P>__{(folding the memo)}
<D>__{the national security advisor and the attorney general agreed.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm going to get us access. keep your go bags hot. it's gonna come fast.}
<A>__{leavitt stares at fleury as he moves fast out of the room.}
<C>__{adam leavitt}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well... i guess he's gonna go get us some access.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how's he gonna do that?}
<A>__{sykes just hard eyes leavitt.}
