<A>__{hammered by wind, fry opens her eyes experimentally. fry's pov: a vortex of motion, of speed, of blurring debris. but the ship is burrowing in. burrowing under . fry pivots her chair 180 degrees a nanosecond before... dirt avalanches into the cockpit . it buries camera.}

<A>__{choking yellow dust. ghostly silhouettes are coughing, moaning, calling out to other survivors in english and, surreally, in arabic. soon we find... johns. ears running blood. stumbling his way to... riddick's cryo locker. empty. johns reaches for his holster. gone, torn right off his belt. no prisoner and no weapon spooky combination. nearby he sees... the light of a cutting torch. someone's using it to open a jammed cryo locker. the plexi is torched away to reveal... audrey, 12 years old. unscathed.}

<D>__{somethin' went wrong, huh?}
<A>__{johns searches for his pistol. behind him, two chained feet lower into frame and then attack, swinging over johns' head... getting the chain on his neck...twisting hard, using the chain as a choke collar. johns flicks open a baton, swings it up at... riddick. still in body chains and mouth bit. clinging to a ceiling support. riding out the baton blows. seconds from blacking out, johns strains forward...forward...and finally breaks riddick's grip on the support. he keeps hold of the chained feet so that... riddick slams headfirst into the deck. johns lays the baton on his neck.}
