<A>__{door opens. crockett leads isabella in. he uncuffs her. she rips away from his hand holding her arm. she walks to the other end of the large room with the picture windows overlooking the water and the jetty and a boat tied up there. low furniture. sparse, it was built in the '60's. she walks to a restroom, slams the door. offscreen, a faucet runs. suddenly, the door opens. she comes out, glaring, shouting.}
