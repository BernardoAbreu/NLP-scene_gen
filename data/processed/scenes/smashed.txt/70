<A>__{kate half laughs.}
<C>__{mr. davies }
<D>__{and just think: the kids got a lesson about life and death that nobody planned on. i mean, you're years ahead of the standard curriculum for, uh, third graders.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{does it matter that i lied? that i was never pregnant?}
<C>__{mr. davies}
<D>__{you want me to answer that as a friend or as someone who takes the twelve steps very seriously?}
<A>__{kate shrugs.}

<D>__{the kids won't ask about it anymore and as long as you don't toss your cookies again you won't have to deal with it.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(long beat)}
<D>__{and the bad news?}
<C>__{mr. davies}
