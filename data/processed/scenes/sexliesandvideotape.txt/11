<P>__{(to graham)}

<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(to graham)}
<D>__{you did that?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{everybody has a past.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(smiles at graham)}
<D>__{what do you think the greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{a bonfire, probably.}
<A>__{john takes a sip of chivas.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(to ann)}
<D>__{this food is excellent.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah, it's not bad. usually ann has some serious salt action going. i keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(to ann)}
<D>__{you have family here also?}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(nods, chewing)}
<D>__{mother, father, sister.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{sister older or younger?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{younger.}
<A>__{john takes a large swig of chivas.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{are you close?}
<A>__{graham sees ann and john exchange looks.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i'm sorry. am i prying again?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you were prying before?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes, this afternoon. i was grilling ann about your marriage this afternoon.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{really. how'd it go?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{she held up very well.}
<A>__{ann laughs.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(to ann)}
<D>__{so i was asking about your sister.}
<A>__{ann's smile fades. john resumes eating.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{oh, we get along okay. she's just very...she's an extrovert. i think she's loud. she probably wouldn't agree. definitely wouldn't agree.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(to graham)}
<D>__{are you going to see elizabeth while you re here?}
<A>__{an almost imperceptible reaction by graham.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(interested)}
<D>__{who's elizabeth?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{girl graham dated. still lives here, far as i know.}
<A>__{graham eats in silence.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{graham and i were talking about apartments and i told him to check the garden district, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(to graham)}
<D>__{stay away from the garden district. serious crime. i don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio type apartments available elsewhere.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i wish i didn't have to live someplace.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<A>__{graham thinks a moment, then puts his keyring with its single key onto the table.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{well, see, right now i have this one key, and i really like that. everything i own is in my car. if i get an apartment, that's two keys. if i get a job, maybe i have to open and close once in awhile, that's more keys. or i buy some stuff and i m worried about getting ripped off, so i get some locks, and that's more keys. i just really like having the one key. it's clean, you know?}
<A>__{graham looks at the keyring before returning it to his pocket.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i like having the car, the car is important.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{or go someplace in a hurry.}
<A>__{ann takes her plate into the kitchen.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(smiles at graham)}
<D>__{do you pay taxes?}
<A>__{graham also stands, empty plate in hand.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{do i pay taxes? of course i pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, i'm not a liar. a liar is the second lowest form of human being.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(from the kitchen)}
<D>__{what's the first?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{lawyers.}
<A>__{john smiles, thinking. graham follows ann into the kitchen. john shouts after them.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey, ann, why don't you go with graham to hunt for apartments? show him how the city has changed.}
<A>__{ann looks at graham.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{would you mind?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(shouts back to john)}
<D>__{okay, i will!!}
<A>__{john, sitting at the table and now toying with his keyring, nods.}
