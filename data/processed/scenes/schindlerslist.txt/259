<L>__{exterior brinnlitz camp dawn}
<A>__{a lone russian officer on horseback, tattered coat, rope for reins, emerges from the forest. as he draws nearer, it becomes apparent to the workers assembling on the camp yard, that the horse is a mere pony, the russian's feet in stirrups nearly touching the ground beneath the animal's skinny abdomen. he reaches the camp, climbs easily down from the horse and, in a loud voice, addresses the hundreds of workers standing at the fence:}
<C>__{russian}
<D>__{you have been liberated by the soviet army.}
<A>__{this is it? this one man? the workers wait for him to say more. he waits for them to move, to leave, to go home. finally }
<C>__{russian}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{a few of the workers come out from behind the fence to talk with him.}
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{have you been in poland?}
<C>__{russian}
<D>__{i just came from poland.}
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{are there any jews left?}
<A>__{the russian has to think. eventually he shrugs, 'no,' not that he saw, and climbs back onto his pony to leave.}
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{where should we go?}
<C>__{russian}
<D>__{i don't know. don't go east, that's for sure, they hate you there.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i wouldn't go west either if i were you.}
<A>__{he shrugs and gives his little horse a kick in the ribs.}
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{we could use some food.}
<A>__{the russian looks confused, glances off. the quiet hamlet of brinnlitz sits there against the mountains not half a mile away.}
<C>__{russian}
<D>__{isn't that a town over there?}
<A>__{of course it is. but the idea that they could simply walk over there is completely foreign to them. the russian rides away.}
