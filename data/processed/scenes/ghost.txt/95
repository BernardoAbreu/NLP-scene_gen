<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{oda mae reaches into her purse and pulls out a driver's license and a social security card. furgeson gets up and walks away from his desk. he seems unsteady on his feet. an officer at the next desk is using a brillo pad to clean a stain on her desk. oda mae smiles.}
<C>__{oda mae}
<D>__{you know, if you put that brillo pad in the freezer, it'll last twice as long.}
<A>__{the officer nods appreciatively.}
