<L>__{interior recording studio day}
<A>__{camera dollies in quick. dirk and reed are violently haggling in an office of the recording studio with the manager.}
<C>__{dirk}
<D>__{c'mon, man, c'mon, c'mon, alright }
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i can't let you take the tapes until the bill is paid in full.}
<C>__{dirk}
<D>__{that makes a lot of sense.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{wait, wait, wait. how can he pay the price of the demo if he can't take the demo tapes to a record company?}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{that's not my problem. my job is to collect payment before we hand over the tapes.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{you can't get a record contract if the record company can't hear what you've got.}
<C>__{dirk}
<D>__{ok: wait a minute have you heard my tape? huh? have you heard it? i'm guaranteed to get a record deal because my stuff is so good. once that happens, i will pay you }
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{it's not gonna happen. this is a catch 22, i understand. you're saying this thing and i get it but i just won't let it happen.}
<C>__{dirk}
<D>__{a catch what?}
