<D>__{chieko walks down crowded tokyo streets. she walks with a lost gaze, unsettled.}
<L>__{exterior apartment building, tokyo day}
<D>__{chieko arrives at an upper class apartment complex. the architecture is cutting edge, but impersonal and cold.}
<L>__{interior lobby, tokyo apartment building day}
<D>__{chieko enters the lobby. beside the doorman are two men dressed in suits: kenji (31) and hamano (50). the janitor gestures at chieko with his chin. the men walk over toward her and cut her off.}
<C>__{hamano}
<D>__{are you yasujiro wataya's daughter? chieko doesn't manage to read his lips. she is silent. the doorman notices the situation, walks out from behind his small desk and shouts at the men.}
<C>__{doorman}
<D>__{she's deaf mute. face her when you speak so she can read your lips. kenji and hamano are disconcerted. hamano stands squarely in front of her and speaks slowly, emphasizing every word.}
<C>__{hamano}
<D>__{are you yasujiro wataya's daughter? she nods.}
<C>__{hamano }
<D>__{we are sargeants kenji mamiya and hamano kanoo of the tokyo police. we need to find your father. she pulls out a pen and a piece of paper from her bag. she scrawls a few lines and hands them over. hamano reads it and turns his face toward hers.}
<C>__{hamano }
<D>__{no, he didn't do anything wrong. we just want to talk to him. do you know where he is? she shrugs her shoulders. kenji gives her his card. upon receiving it, chieko turns to look at him. their eyes meet and she looks down. she then looks up again, blushing.}
<C>__{kenji}
<D>__{tell him to call us. and don't be scared, we're not going to do anything bad to him.}
<C>__{hamano}
<D>__{thank you. chieko can't stop staring at kenji. the two cops leave. as soon as they do, chieko heads toward the elevator.}
