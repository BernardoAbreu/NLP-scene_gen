<D>__{questions?}
<C>__{russ millard}
<D>__{what's your best guess?}
<C>__{coroner}
<D>__{here's what she wasn't. she wasn't raped, she wasn't pregnant, dried semen indicates voluntary intercourse within the last week...she took what i'd call a gentle whipping in the last ten days...in terms of the nitty gritty...she was probably tortured with a knife for thirty six to forty eight hours before death. the cause of which is either the mouth wound or more likely she was beaten to death with something like a baseball bat.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{what about her insides?}
<C>__{coroner}
<D>__{they came out after death. then i'd say he drained the blood from the body and washed it clean, probably in a bathtub.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{did the guy know anything about medicine or anatomy?}
<C>__{coroner}
<D>__{maybe. probably not a surgeon type but that doesn't rule out veterinary training, biological training, or my pathology for beginners class at ucla. has she got a name yet?}
