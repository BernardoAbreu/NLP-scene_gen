<D>__{i need to see lecter in as much privacy as possible.}
<B>__{two shot}
<A>__{graham sits in front of his desk in a chair. he appears repressed, clamped down. dr. chilton is a sincere chief of staff, but not gifted.}
<C>__{dr. chilton}
<D>__{dr. lecter will stay in his room. that is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. one wall of his room is a double barrier. i will have a chair put just outside.}

<D>__{i might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.}
<C>__{dr. chilton}

<C>__{dr. chilton}
<D>__{here lecter's resting on the examining table getting an electrocardiogram. complained of chest pains. pulse seventy two. here he grabs the nurse's head and pulls her down to him. here he's subdued by the attendant and lecter's shoulder is dislocated. do you notice the strange thing?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{his pulse never got over eighty five. even when he tore into her face.}
<A>__{dr. chilton looks over at graham, perhaps expecting a. response. there is nothing to read in graham's face. it is a blank.}
