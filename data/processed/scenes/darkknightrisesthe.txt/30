<L>__{interior east wing, wayne manor morning}
<A>__{alfred takes his tray into the bedroom. the bed is empty.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{master wayne?}
<A>__{alfred's voice echoes through the vast mansion. no reply.}
<L>__{interior study, wayne manor moments later}
<A>__{alfred hits three notes on the piano. the bookcase opens.}
<L>__{interior elevator shaft continuous}
<A>__{alfred descends into the caverns beneath wayne manor.}
<L>__{interior batcave continuous}
<A>__{alfred walks through the arches as the stone floor starts to lower, becoming a ramp. at the bottom, alfred is level with a series of dark slate obelisks a bridge over the water to where wayne sits at a computer atop a massive slate cube.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{you haven't been down here in a long time...}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{just trying to find out more about our jewel thief. i ran her prints from the photos she handled }
<A>__{wayne pulls up a mug shot a fat, male armed robbery suspect.}
<D>__{ but she was wearing someone else's fingerprints. she's good.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{she may be. but we have the trace on the necklace.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{we do, so i cross referenced the address she went back to with police data on high end b and e's...}
<A>__{wayne hits a key. a photograph of the maid appears.}
<D>__{selina kyle. the databases are full of close calls, tips from fences...}
<A>__{newspaper headlines appear the cat strikes again, police suspect 'cat' burglar in jewel}
<B>__{heist.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{she's good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{we should send the police before she fences the pearls.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{she won't. she likes them too much. and they weren't what she was after.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{what was she after?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{my fingerprints. there was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe. gives you a good pull, and it's untraceable.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{fascinating. maybe you should exchange notes over coffee.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{now you're trying to set me up with a jewel thief?}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{at this point, sir, i would set you up with a chimpanzee if i thought it would bring you back into the world.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{there's nothing out there for me.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{and that's the problem. you hung up the cape and cowl, but never moved on. you won't get out there and find a life. find someone }
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(bitter)}
<D>__{i did find someone, alfred.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{i know. and then you lost them. that's part of living, sir. but you're not living you're waiting. hoping for things to go bad again.}
<A>__{wayne says nothing.}
<D>__{remember when you left gotham? before all this. before batman. seven years you were gone. seven years i waited. hoping that you wouldn't come back.}
<A>__{wayne looks at alfred. not understanding.}
<D>__{every year i took my holiday. i'd go to florence. there's a cafe by the arno... any fine evening i would sit there and order a fernet branca...}
<A>__{insert cut: alfred seated in a cafe sipping his drink...}
<D>__{i had a fantasy. i liked to imagine that one day i'd look across the tables, and see you. sitting there with your wife. perhaps some kids. you wouldn't say anything to me, or me to you, but we'd both know...that you'd made it. that you were happy.}
<A>__{insert cut: alfred spots a couple at another table and looks closer, hopeful. but they are strangers.}
<D>__{i never wanted you to come back to gotham. i knew there was nothing there for you but pain and tragedy, and i wanted more for you than that. i still do.}
<A>__{alfred leaves wayne to his cave. his bats.}
