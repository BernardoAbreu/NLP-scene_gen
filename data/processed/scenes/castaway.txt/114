<A>__{chuck scrambles down a ravine. he kneels down and feels the ground. it is dry, completely dry.}
<L>__{exterior lava slope day}
<A>__{chuck traverses the slope, determined to find water. a flat rock later with a puddle of dirty water trapped in a tiny hollow. suddenly chuck flops down into frame. he tries to scoop up some water in his hands, but he just splashes it around. he licks his fingers. then he gets down on his stomach and laps up the water with his tongue. like an animal. in the bottom of the small depression is some fine mud. he rubs it on his reddened face and across his burned lips.}
