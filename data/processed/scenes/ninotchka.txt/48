<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{shooting from a high angle. we hear the sound of an airplane just taking off. camera pulls back so that swana seems to be photographed from the airplane. finally the shot discloses the whole airport and swana disappearing into the crowd. entrance hall swana's apartment swana's maid is opening the door for swana, who enters in the highest spirits.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{good afternoon, jacqueline.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{good afternoon, your highness.}
<P>__{(hesitantly)}
<D>__{madame, i...}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{you didn't find my glove. all right, you're forgiven.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{thank you, your highness. count d'algout is waiting. he's been here some time.}
<A>__{swana inspects herself briefly in the hall mirror, proceeds into the living room. living room swana's apartment leon is pacing up and down. swana enters.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{leon, darling, how nice! have you ordered tea or a cocktail?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{no thanks, swana.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{did i act stupidly last night? should i apologize?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i'm the one who should apologize. i should have talked to you before.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{oh, no, my little volga boatman. have you forgotten our first commandment: never complain never explain. it has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. and please don't look so guilty, otherwise i will...}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{this time, swana just this once i must ask you to listen.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{all right, i will listen.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, i'm not in the least subtle?}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{brutal frankness, if you insist.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{there are a hundred ways to approach it, but i feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. i'm in love, swana.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{and i thought it was something serious! how could you frighten me so?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{it must be serious, swana. not long ago i'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. now i can say it without stammering, without a blush. i'm in love, swana.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{say it over and over again, leon. words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need because you know it's impossible, don't you?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i have to be simple again, swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. i've thought it over and i'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{leon! this has the ugly sound of regeneration.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i'm afraid that's what it is.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{the same old trouble, leon. you're always late. whether you're taking me to the opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. and now, when it's a question of your reform late again.}
<P>__{(she glances at her wrist watch)}
<D>__{by about five minutes.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{what is this, swana?}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{knowing the efficiency of the french air service i think i can guarantee that madame yakushova has already taken off for moscow.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{has done what?}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{she's gone, leon.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{do you expect me to believe that?}
<A>__{swana picks up the receiver of the telephone and holds it out to him.}
<C>__{swana}
<D>__{here's the telephone. if you call the hotel you will find that you have no seven o'clock appointment.}
<B>__{the moscow plane}
<A>__{it is flying past the eiffel tower. close shot airplane window behind the window we see ninotchka looking at paris for the last time. camera moves over to the next window and we see buljanoff, iranoff, and kopalski also giving paris a sad farewell look. another view of paris, from the air. the mist has closed in by now so that only the top of the eiffel tower is visible above it. close up ninotchka, looking down on the tower}
