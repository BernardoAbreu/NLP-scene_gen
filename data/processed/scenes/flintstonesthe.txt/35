<L>__{interior lodge recreation area later}
<A>__{widen as barney propels a bowling ball (stone, of course) rumbling down the alley, sending pins flying. the buffaloes cheer barney's strike. we notice that most (if not all) of these lodge members also work at the quarry.}
<B>__{automatic pin spotter}
<A>__{it descends. it consists of a bent snout creature which "cranks" down a shelf with several monkeys on it. the monkeys grab the pins with their tails, straighten them up. then the shelf cranks back up.}
<B>__{other end of alley}
<A>__{now it's fred's turn. he trots up to the line, bowls... another strike! more cheers, ad lib complaints, etc. the scorekeeper picks up hammer and chisel and fills out the last frame.}
<C>__{lodge member}
<D>__{congratulations, fred.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{hey, when you're hot you're hot... boys, lemme buy a round of drinks for everyone.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{thanks, fred, but here at the lodge drinks are free.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{but the principle is the same, barn. don't forget that.}
<A>__{fred leads the group over to the bar. piltdown and pyrite come along with a shrug... why not, for a brew? fred reaches }
<B>__{under the counter}
<A>__{where he pulls out a hook beaked little lizard }
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{fred uses this creature to open several beers.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(during this)}
<D>__{here you go, boys, nice and frosty...}
<P>__{"bottle opener" creature (lizard) (aside)}
<D>__{go ahead, laugh. if i had a good orthodontist, my life woulda been different...}
<A>__{fred tosses the "opener" aside }
<B>__{under the counter}
<A>__{the critter bounces into the shelf, slides... when it re covers, it realizes that its overbite has been straightened out by the impact. very happy, it grabs a hat and coat, exits.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(raising drink)}
<D>__{well, here's to...}
<A>__{he looks around, sees "photo" on wall it's actually "dots" chipped into a stone. it shows the young fred, barney and others gathered around soapbox racers. a banner reads "junior buffalo day."}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{here's to the greatest bunch of lifelong buffaloes a guy could dream of leading.}
<P>__{(an obvious prompt)}
<D>__{anybody else got a toast...?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{'here's to the water buffalo and their next herdmaster... fred'!}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{aw, gee, barn... you shouldn't say that...}
<P>__{(winking)}
<D>__{... at least not till after next week's election!}
<C>__{lodge member}
<D>__{fred, what was all that stuff in your speech about the workplace? i thought the only decision you made there was how many lunches to eat }
<A>__{laughter. fred accepts it good naturedly, reaches into his pocket.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{well, harry, it just so happens that old fred is moving up in the world... boys, you're looking at mr. slate's new partner.}
<C>__{piltdown}
<D>__{you and slate? who are you kidding, flintstone? the only partner you got is hanging over your belt.}
<A>__{pyrite laughs, a bit too much.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{prepare to eat those words, piltdown.}
<C>__{piltdown}
<D>__{ if i don't, you will }
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(a tight smile)}
<D>__{gentlemen, my card }
<A>__{he passes them out, and the others take them, curious insert card of course it's a little stone tablet... but it does indeed say "slate construction f. flintstone, assistant jr. v.p. public relations."}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{lodge members}
<P>__{(ad lib, impressed)}
<D>__{hey, way ta go, fred... whoa, gonna switch from a hard hat to a top hat, freddy boy...?}
<C>__{pyrite}
<P>__{(examining the card)}
<D>__{ah, it's probably a phony...}
<A>__{saying this, he bites down on it... winces as a tooth cracks.}
<B>__{barney}
<A>__{tugs fred's sleeve, pulls him close.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{gee, fred, how come i didn't get any business cards?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{barney, it's all part of the plan.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{yes, boys, you see, i went up to my pal, mister slate and single handedly made him an offer he couldn't refuse }
<A>__{(barney reacts to the "single handedly" )}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{ 'freddy boy,' he sez to me, 'we gotta talk turkey '}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{fred, we gotta talk turkey }
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{that's right just like that }
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{fred !}
<A>__{fred realizes barney's got something on his mind.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{ah, excuse us, boys...}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{fred pulls barney into a quiet corridor. they stand near a trophy case. there's some bowling trophies here with a variety of names on them. (there's also trophies for "pie eating contests" and "beer drinking chug offs"; these have only fred's name on them.)}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{fred... what's this single handed stuff? i distinctly remember at least four hands and two of them were mine.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(lowered voice)}
<D>__{barney, we could tell everyone how you invented this fibrerock stuff, how slate and lava found out about it by accident and all, but what would that be?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{the truth?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{this is big business, barney. we can't start telling the truth, it'd create the wrong impression. think about all the really big deals in history back to the beginning of recorded time.}
<A>__{barney knits his brow in thought for maybe three seconds.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{what do they all have in common?}
<P>__{(as barney is stumped)}
<D>__{i will tell you. a front man. a guy who's out in the public eye running the point, fighting the crowds... and meanwhile... back in the corner is the silent partner.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{i never knew that.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{that's because the silent partner is always silent.}
<C>__{fred }
<D>__{but while you're busy being silent }
<P>__{(conspiratorially)}
<D>__{ all along you're the brains behind the operation and i'm the brains in front of the operation. i'm out here running the guts of the operation but you got a cut. it looks like my mind, but you're really behind.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{i get it. i got the brains, but you just pretend to have them.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{attaboy!}
<A>__{and a confident fred shakes hands with an unsure "silent partner"...}
