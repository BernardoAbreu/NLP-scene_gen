<D>__{but i believe we should pause now to do a little stock taking to look into our own hearts and see what we find there. therefore instead of continuing the service, i think we should all return to our homes for private meditation, remembering how little we have to complain of and how much to be grateful for. next week i shall discuss the fruits of our meditation. until then, my blessing upon each and every one of you.}
