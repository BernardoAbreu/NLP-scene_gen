<L>__{interior police station night}
<A>__{a ratty interrogation room. institutional green walls. beat up file cabinets. dark. a bit of fluorescent light spills in through the frosted glass door. lila, thirties, sits at the end of a long table. a reel to reel tape recorder whirs in front of her. she is smoking. three fat, mean looking cops sit in shadows at the other end of the table. one of the cops eyes her lasciviously. lila's hand shakes as she brings the cigarette to her mouth.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i'm not sorry. so i spend the rest of my life in jail. so what? i've been in jail my whole life anyway. a jail of blood and tissue and coursing hormones...}
<A>__{one of the cops sighs and massages the bridge of his nose. it's going to be a long night.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{...a jail called the human body.}
<A>__{the lascivious cop smiles lasciviously at lila's reference to "human body."}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{my soul held prisoner in this reeking, stench ridden bag of bones and entrails. a bag of feces and piss and fibroid cysts in my tits and precancerous moles on my sun damaged back...}
<A>__{the lascivious cop gags, then vomits on the floor. lila drags on her cigarette, calmer now.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{at least now i will be able to blame the state, not god, for my incarceration.}
