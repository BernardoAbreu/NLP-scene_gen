<D>__{... in the daytimes we sometimes play volleyball against the big turkish gangsters...}
<A>__{the three they play against are hilarious looking in this context, moving like big clumsy bears, waving their arms and screaming at each other, disorganized. ever conscious of fashion, they have their jackets and vests off but play in their elvis presley shirts rolled up at the sleeves, shiny slacks, black pointed pumps. the boys wear shorts and sneakers. on the sidelines we see a group of prisoners laying bets and shouting encouragement. billy leaps up for a ball close to the net and as the turkish opponent backs off, he dinks the ball in just over the net; the turk screams his teammates scream at him.}
