<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{kelvin stands outside a door.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{let me in.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<P>__{(inside, muffled)}
<D>__{you have to give me your word you won't come in. then i will come out.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{sartorius cracks the door open and slithers through the slit and into the hallway. he is of obvious intelligence and not to be messed with; contentious, intimidating when he wants to be, and probably brilliant. kelvin eyes him suspiciously.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{what happened to gibarian?}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{didn't you talk to snow?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{i want to hear your version.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{who, here, could possibly care what you want? at best, you're employee of the month for the highest bidder in the solaris auction. they have no idea what's going on up here. they've never even been in space. and i'm supposed to listen to you?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{i am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation. now: what happened to him?}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{the same thing that could happen to any of us.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{where's his body?}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{in the lab. with her, probably.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{her? who are you talking about?}
<A>__{sartorius is grabbed by something on the other side of his door. he struggles to keep his composure.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{his last wish was to be buried on earth. in dirt, he said. "i want to buried in dirt." what a clown.}
<A>__{sartorius is losing the battle with whomever or whatever is on the other side of his door.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{they shouldn't let people like you into space.}
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{just so you know: i'm not going back until i understand what it is. i am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then i will go home.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{listen }
<C>__{sartorius}
<D>__{we're done. oh, i should tell you, i don't trust snow. there's something wrong with him.}
<A>__{sartorius rotates and zips back into his room. as the door closes kelvin sees a flash of another figure in sartorius' room. the glimpse was too quick to judge who or what the other figure could have been.}
