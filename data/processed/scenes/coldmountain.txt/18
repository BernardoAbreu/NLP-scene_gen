<L>__{interior confederate tent. night}
<A>__{a dozen men in the tent. inman has a book, its cover gone, rolled up and tied with a leather strap. his bookmark is a faded tintype photograph of a solemn young woman. he unwraps the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next to his bedroll. an officer comes into the tent, approaches inman, who makes a stand.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{don't get up, soldier. you are mentioned tonight in my report. you are a credit to the highlands, to north carolina and to the cause.}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(tight)}
<D>__{do you have news, sir, on my application for transfer?}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{i know. a bloody day. it's what our general said: good thing war is so terrible else a man might end up liking it too much.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{sir. it was my understanding the medical corps was desperate for volunteers.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{right now, soldier, it's me who is in need of volunteers. there's a dozen yankees in that stand of trees between us. stuck there from the retreat. come daylight they can shoot us down for sport.}
