<D>__{i will check the building.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{he rushes back out and down the stairs. willie stays in the apartment. suddenly, the doorbell rings. willie rushes over and opens the door a crack. there is no one there. confused, he backs away. the doorbell rings again. completely mystified, he aims his gun and opens the door all the way. the hallway is empty. as willie stands there, wondering what is happening, sam steps inside and pushes the door closed. it slams shut. willie nearly jumps out of his skin.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{damn!}
<A>__{he stares at the door in total bewilderment. at that instant, a collection of picture frames flies off the breakfront and crashes into his legs. he backs away, spooked. suddenly, the t.v. flicks on at full volume and then the stereo and the radio. lights begin flashing on and off. willie spins around in total dismay. summoning all of his force, sam slams into willie. willie recoils in unexplainable pain. he seems very disoriented. his gun falls to the floor. he reaches for it and sam pushes it away. willie jumps up, afraid. his eyes dart around the room. sam laughs.}

<A>__{a pair of candle holders shoot off the mantle piece and nearly hit willie in the head. he freaks. grabbing his gun, willie runs into the bathroom and locks the door. suddenly the hot water faucet turns on by itself. willie is terrified. steam rises from the sink. willie tries to get out, but sam approaches him from behind and appears to dig his hands into his neck. willie crumples to his knees.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{oh god!}
<A>__{there is a squeaking sound and willie looks up. letters are appearing in the fogged mirror. he stares in disbelief as the word "b o o!" emerges before him. he cries out.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{let me outta here!}
<A>__{shaking uncontrollably, willie fires his gun at the mirror. glass and tiles explode. willie is cut and bleeding. he grabs hold of the door and yanks it open.}
