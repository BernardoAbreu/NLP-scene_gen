<D>__{gettin' any?}
<A>__{bucky's about to respond when the lights dim and a blurred image hits the screen. it begins to focus. a title: "slave girls from hell" the movie: a big high ceiling room with egyptian hieroglyphics on the walls. pillars shaped like coiled serpents are stationed throughout the room; the camera zooms in for a close up of two inset plaster snakes swallowing each other's tails. the snakes dissolve into betty short, wearing only stockings and doing an inept hoochie koochie dance... an audible breath in the muster room. a hand reaches into frame, passing betty a large cylindrical object: a dildo, scales covering the shaft, fangs extending from the circumcised head. betty puts it in her mouth, sucks it, eyes wide open and glassy. an abrupt cut: linda martin, naked, lying on a divan. betty enters the frame with the dildo; she puts it between linda's legs, pushing it inside her. linda rotates her hips, trying her best to fake ecstasy instead of pain and sadness. another cut: betty mouthing the words "no, please" to the camera. a hand pushing her head down towards linda's crotch. betty tonguing next to the dildo...}
