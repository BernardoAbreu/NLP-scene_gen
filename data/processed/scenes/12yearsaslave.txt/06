<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{solomon and his family are out walking along the streets and groves of saratoga. the streets are well populated this morning with many people out strolling. most are white, but there are blacks as well. they are freed blacks who mingle fairly easily though not always completely with the whites. we see, too, a few black slaves who travel with their white masters. these pairings are largely from the south and despite the fact the blacks are slaves they are not physically downtrodden, not field hands. they are well dressed and "leading apparently an easy life" comparatively speaking as they trail their masters. as they walk, solomon and his family arrive to an intersection well worn and muddied from horse and cart traffic. solomon and his children easily jump across the muck. anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for solomon to help her across.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{solomon...}
<A>__{solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile waving her forward:}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{come, anne. jump.}
<A>__{the children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on.}
<C>__{alonzo}
<D>__{jump. you can make it.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i've done it. you can make it.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i will not ruin my dress. catch me!}
<A>__{solomon moves close, holds out his arms. yet, there's still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes. anne gives her husband a lightly stern look to which solomon replies.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{i will catch you, anne.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will.}
<A>__{again, lightly stern:}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you will.}
<A>__{and with that anne takes the leap. solomon catches her, swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to the delighted applause of the children. that done, solomon takes anne's hand and leads her on. as solomon and his family make their way, among the slaves on the street, we see one in particular; jasper. as he trails his master he can't help but note solomon and his family as they enter a store. his intrigue of this most handsome and harmonious group should be obvious. with his master occupied, jasper moves slyly toward the store. frozen on the spot, jasper looks on admiringly. suddenly a voice barks out }
<C>__{a voice }
<D>__{jasper! come on!}
