<L>__{interior the apartment evening}
<A>__{what used to be the upstairs parlor of a one family house in the early 1900's has been chopped up into living room, bedroom, bathroom and kitchen. the wallpaper is faded, the carpets are threadbare, and the upholstered furniture could stand shampooing. there are lots of books, a record player, stacks of records, a television set (21 inches and 24 payments), unframed prints from the museum of modern art (picasso, braque, klee) tacked up on the walls. only one lamp is lit, for mood, and a cha cha record is spinning around on the phonograph. on the coffee table in front of the couch are a couple of cocktail glasses, a pitcher with some martini dregs, an almost empty bottle of vodka, a soup bowl with a few melting ice cubes at the bottom, some potato chips, an ashtray filled with cigar stubs and lipstick stained cigarette butts, and a woman's handbag. mr. kirkeby, a dapper, middle aged man, stands in front of the mirror above the fake fireplace, buttoning up his vest. he does not notice that the buttons are out of alignment.}
