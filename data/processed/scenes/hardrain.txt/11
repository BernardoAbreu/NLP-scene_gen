<A>__{a wave of water rushes forward from the truck, then comes back and washes over the hood, splashing up on the windshield.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{back up!}
<A>__{charlie throws the truck into reverse but gives it too much power. they hear the rear wheels spinning underwater. charlie eases off, the tires start to catch, they start moving backwards. charlie and tom exchange a quick look of relief... and then the engine dies. charlie tries to restart it, but there's nothing.}
<B>__{outside the truck}
<A>__{it's stopped on a downgrade it's a dip in the road. the water is up to the top of the front tires: up to the hubcaps on the rear wheels. the headlights are underwater, spots of yellow glowing. they've stopped next to a lighted sign.}
