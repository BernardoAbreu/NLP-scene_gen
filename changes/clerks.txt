<ACTION>__{A DOG sleeps on a neatly made bed. A CLOCK reads twenty to six. A SHELF OF BOOKS holds such classics as Dante's Inferno, Beyond Good and Evil, The Catcher in the Rye, and The Dark Knight Returns. A FRAMED DIPLOMA, dusty and unkempt, hangs askew on the wall. A snapshot of a girl is stuck in the corner, and a bra weighs one end down. A PHONE sits quietly atop a bundle of laundry. It suddenly explodes with a resounding ring-once, twice, three times. A CLOSET DOOR swings open, and a half-clad figure falls out. THE PHONE rings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking it off the trash can, O.C. THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his back to the camera, phone in hand.}

<ACTION>__{THE PHONE RECEIVER slams into the cradle. THE RUMPLED FIGURE slowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair and stands. THE DOG stands and wags its tail. A hand pats its head. The Rumpled Figure lays down on the bed. We now see his face. It is the face of DANTE and this is Dante's room; this is Dante's life. DANTE grabs the dog and wrestles it.}

THE CAT looks at DANTE as he passes the camera quickly. THE PAPER BUNDLE is snapped open with a knife. Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. One rack remains empty. A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot. Ground coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in the coffeemaker. The switch is flicked and the machine comes to life. The empty newspaper rack with the heading ASBURY PARK PRESS seems out of place among all the other stacks of papers. DANTE rubs his chin and stares, puzzled. He rolls his eyes as it occurs to him.}

He struggles to hold them all in one hand as he lets the door slam shut. He turns to walk away, but the sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops him.

<DIAL_PAR>__{(suddenly outraged)}
<DIAL>__{Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to you trying to pass the buck again. I'm the source of all your misery. Who closed the store to play hockey? Who closed the store to attend a wake? Who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat, as DANTE)}
<DIAL>__{"I'm not even supposed to be here today."}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(whips stuff at DANTE)}
<DIAL>__{You sound like an asshole. Whose choice was it to be here today? Nobody twisted your arm. You're here today of your own violation, my friend. But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here. Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store. Badly, as well.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat)}
<DIAL>__{You know, that guy Jay's got it right-he has no delusions about what he does. Us? We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid-cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced. Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?}
<ACTION>__{RANDAL gets up, leaving DANTE to contemplate his strong words alone.}
<TRANS>__{CUT TO:}
<ACTION>__{DANTE and RANDAL silently clean up, backs to each other.}
<TRANS>__{CUT TO:}
<ACTION>__{DANTE places a mop in the corner. RANDAL pulls on his coat.}
<CHAR>__{RANDAL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.}
<CHAR>__{DANTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You need a ride?}
<CHAR>__{RANDAL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(looks out door)}
<DIAL>__{Got one. Just pulled up.}
<ACTION>__{They stand in silence. Then...}
<CHAR>__{DANTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you work tomorrow?}
<CHAR>__{RANDAL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Same time. What about you?}
<CHAR>__{DANTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.}
<CHAR>__{RANDAL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night...after I get out of here?}
<CHAR>__{DANTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll call you. Let you know.}
<CHAR>__{RANDAL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{All right. Good luck with Veronica. If you want, I can talk to her, you know, and explain...}
<CHAR>__{DANTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.}
<CHAR>__{RANDAL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Helluva day.}
<CHAR>__{DANTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{To say the least.}
<CHAR>__{RANDAL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you...you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.}
<CHAR>__{DANTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Get the fuck outta here already.}
<CHAR>__{RANDAL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.}
<ACTION>__{RANDAL exits. A second later, he reenters and tosses DANTE the sheet-sign.}
<CHAR>__{RANDAL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're closed.}
<ACTION>__{He exits. DANTE pushes the sign over from Open to Closed. DANTE climbs behind the counter. He pops the register open and starts counting the drawer out. The door is heard opening. POV JOHN: DANTE counting out the register, not looking up.}
<CHAR>__{DANTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What'd you forget something?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(looks up, surprised)}
<DIAL>__{Oh. I'm sorry, we're closed.}
<ACTION>__{A gunshot blasts out. DANTE flies back, his chest exploding. He stares ahead and slumps to the floor. JOHN walks behind the counter, stepping over DANTE'S body on the floor, and takes the money out of the register. He grabs a paper bag and jams the money in it. He grabs handfuls of change, shoves it in his pocket, and then quickly exits the frame. DANTE continues to lie on the floor.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{CREDITS}
<ACTION>__{Credits end, and the door is heard opening. A customer comes to the counter and stands there. He waits, looks around for a clerk, looks down the aisles.}
<CHAR>__{CUSTOMER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hello? Little help?}
<ACTION>__{No reply. He looks around again, and glances at the door to make sure nobody's coming in. Then he reaches behind the counter and grabs a pack of cigarettes. He leaves.}
