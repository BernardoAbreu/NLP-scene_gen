<A>__{maurice wheels himself into the hall from the waiting area. he looks around. his eyes lock on the exit sign over the door at the end of the hall. his eyes scan the area quickly. he immediately finds the guard on the floor staring at him. the guard nods ever so slightly as if to say, "i know what you're thinking." maurice turns his attention to a small boy in a hospital gown, being scolded by a head nurse.}

<D>__{you cooperate with us about taking your medicine and maybe we'll talk about candy.}
<A>__{the head nurse takes a chocolate bar out of the boy's tiny hands. the boy offers no response. maurice watches curiously as stephanie walks over and pats the boys head. maurice catches a small exchange stephanie slips another candy bar into his pocket. the boy breaks into a warm smile. stephanie puts her fingers against her lips and winks. maurice takes this exchange in with great interest.}
