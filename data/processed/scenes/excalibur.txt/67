<L>__{interior banquet hall, camelyarde castle evening}
<A>__{the soft beat of psaltery and the liquid flow of lute. a serving platter bearing roast rabbit in rampant position is carried across the hall. it is laid on the long raised table before arthur, who presides in the middle. he looks at it suspiciously and blushes, remembering the afternoon; and it looks back at him accusingly with its cherry eye. guenevere is dancing around her father, lovely, gliding, sensual. she sees arthur and the rabbit and laughs out right. he twists off a leg of the rabbit and sinks his teeth into it to hide his embarrassment. guenevere passes to another partner, smiling at him, radiant. arthur watches her, his heart breaking. he is in love. merlin leans close.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{a king must marry, after all.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{...of course...}
<A>__{only then does he realize that merlin has understood everything. he is annoyed at being so transparent.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i love her. if she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.}
<C>__{merlin}
<P>__{(mischievous)}
<D>__{there are maidens as fair, and fairer than guenevere. if i put my mind to it, i could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. offering you their every favor. rich, clever but if it is to be guenevere, so be it.}
<A>__{a shadow of doubt crosses arthur's brow.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{who will it be? put your mind to it, then.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{guenevere. and a beloved friend who will betray you.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{guenevere...}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{you're not listening. your heart is not. love is deaf as well as blind.}
<A>__{guenevere approaches, smiling and coquettish. she slaps her hands, and a servant sets down a tray of pastries before arthur.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{they are only for you, for in them i mixed things that heal, but not too quickly; and things that make limbs sleepy, preventing escape, but keep one's mind sharp.}
<A>__{she smiles at arthur's embarrassment and confusion.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what's in them?}
<A>__{she takes a cake and bites into it.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{it is an ancient mixture, containing only soft, unborn grains, and flavored with roses. the rest is secret.}
<A>__{guenevere offers one to arthur, and he hesitates, looking at it.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{looking at the cake is like looking at the future. until you have savored its bitterness and its sweetness, its texture and its perfume, what do you really know? and then, of course, it will he too late.}
<A>__{arthur bites into the cake, and guenevere looks deep into his eyes.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{too late...}
