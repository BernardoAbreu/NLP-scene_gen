<A>__{huge, dark red brick buildings with barred windows, loom out of the fog and trees. a van pulls up to the front entrance. two men get out, open the back doors and assist frances out. she is strapped into a strait jacket. she yells and struggles violently but a piercing scream stops her. she looks up at the building. from a top floor window, a thin, white hand protrudes from the bars and waves "hello".}
