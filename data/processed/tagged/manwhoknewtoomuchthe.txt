<A>__{mr. and mrs. ben mckenna at the back of a motor coach with their seven year old son, hank. we do not see much of the background which is receding from us. they are studying the countryside from the windows at each side of them. the camera pulls back down the aisle of the bus revealing the other passengers. they are a surprise, consisting of arab men and women, with an occasional civilian and french army officer. the camera stops at the end of the bus.}

<A>__{the camera moves back to the rear of the bus, photographing the side windows. at the bottom of the screen is the destination board. by the time we get opposite the window out of which the mckennas are looking, we have been able to read the words "casablanca marrakesh."}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. close shot}
<A>__{ben and hank are looking intently out the window. jo's interest seems only casual.}

<L>__{interior bus (day) med. long shot}
<A>__{shooting through the mckenna's window. the bus is entering a small arab village, squat stone and plaster building, narrow streets, a few carts, donkeys and one camel. a few pedestrians, mostly arab men, few women.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. close shot}
<A>__{ben puts his hand on hank's shoulder.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{this isn't really africa, hank. it's french morocco.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(to her)}
<D>__{northern africa.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{still seems like las vegas.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(slightly indignant)}
<D>__{we're only a hundred miles north of the sahara desert!}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. long shot}
<A>__{the bus is passing through the center of the town. we move past a few shops, everything looking drab and meager. the sun is strong and hot.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. long shot}
<A>__{hank studies the scene outside. he shrugs.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{i dunno. in school they called it the dark continent.}
<P>__{(he squints)}
<D>__{it's twice as bright as indianapolis!}
<A>__{jo and ban smile at hank.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{just wait till you see marrakesh.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{marrakesh. sounds like a drink.}
<A>__{ben runs his tongue across his lips.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you bet it does.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. long shot}
<A>__{the bus rolls on past the arab village into the open desert once again. it looks parched and grim.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. close shot}
<A>__{tired of watching the sameness of the desert, hank grows, restless. he looks about for something to do. ben leans back against the seat and closes his eyes. jo takes a paper bound novel out of her bag, finds her place. hank decides to wander down the aisle of the bus and test its possibilities for adventure. the camera dollies back with him as he rather aimlessly makes for the front of the bus,. having left the arab village, the bus picks up speed, and is beginning to bump and sway somewhat. when hank is a little better than half way down the aisle, the bus sways in a particularly startling manner, causing hank to stagger. in order to steady himself, he thrusts out his hand to grab the side of a seat. he misses the seat, and only succeeds in clutching at the veil of an arab woman. unfortunately, he pulls the veil from her face.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) close shot}
<A>__{the startled woman, instantly horrified, covers her face with her hands and gives a sharp cry,}
<L>__{interior bus (day) close shot}
<A>__{with the bus still bumping and swaying, hank staggers a bit without realizing that he still has, hold of the woman's veil.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. shot}
<A>__{the woman still covers her face, but from the seat next to her, and nearer the window, an arab rises and makes a sharp comment in arabic to hank. the arab's robes are brown, with a turban like hat combining twisted strands of white and pale green cloth, the arab starts to move past the woman, toward hank, repeating his demand.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. shot}
<A>__{people look quickly toward the sound, wondering at the reason for the trouble.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) close shot}
<A>__{the bus driver scans his rear vision mirror for the source of the trouble behind him.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) close shot}
<A>__{hank looks up at the oncoming arab, and retreats uncertainly, not realizing he is still holding the veil.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) close shot}
<A>__{the arab in the brown robes begins assaulting the boy in furious arabic, indicating that he wants the veil.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. close shot}
<A>__{two arabs, and a veiled woman, rise in their seats apparently disturbed by what the brown clothed arab is saying. they being talking among themselves.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. close shot}
<A>__{ben and his wife, jo, are straining from their back seat and looking down the aisle to see what is wrong. ben looks at his wife quickly and then back, indicating that hank is involved.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) close shot}
<A>__{still staring straight at the arab, both frightened and fascinated by his verbal attack, hank retreats.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. shot}
<A>__{except for the french passengers, everyone in the bus is in a state of disturbance. the arab continues to advance on hank keeping up a steady tirade of arabic.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) close shot}
<A>__{ben rises quickly and advances protectively toward his son and the oncoming arab.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. shot}
<A>__{hank retreats and squeezes himself against his mother, still with the veil in one hand. ben faces the arab who stops, but continues his monologue for ben's benefit.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{now wait a minute. wait a minute. simmer down.}
<A>__{the arab continues pointing, talking.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. close shot}
<A>__{from a nearby seat a young frenchman in civilian clothes rises quickly. the camera pans him to ben and the arab. he pushes in between the pair.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{pardon me.}
<A>__{he turns to the arab, moves him back a little, sharply silences his attack, and then begins, in arabic, to explain firmly that the boy meant, no harm. it was an accident. the arab isn't convinced, points to hank.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. close shot}
<A>__{the frenchman leans toward hank and takes the veil he is still unconsciously holding. he hands it to the arab with a sharp command to return to his seat. the arab turns away carrying the veil. as the camera pans him away, we see the spectators resuming their seats, growing quiet.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. close shot}
<A>__{hank and jo relax. ben addresses the frenchman, a pleasant looking young man. he is louis bernard.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'd like to thank you. without your help, anything might have happened.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(smiles pleasantly)}
<D>__{a pleasure, monsieur. there are moments in life when we all need a little help.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{may i introduce my wife, mrs. mckenna.}
<A>__{louis turns pleasantly to jo.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{how do you do, madame. my name is louis bernard.}
<A>__{she returns his smile.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{thank you, mr. bernard.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{and this is our son, hank.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{hallo, hank.}
<A>__{he holds out his hand to hank, who takes it.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{you talk arab talk.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{a few words.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{why was he so angry? it was an accident.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(half shrugs)}
<D>__{the moslem religion allows for few accidents.}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{may i be permitted to sit down?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{oh, sure, sure. 0f course. next to jo, there.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{i thought his name was hank.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{oh, uh }
<C>__{ben }
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{that's my wife's name. jo. jay oh. no "e."}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. close shot}
<A>__{louis bernard slides into the seat next to jo, who moves over slightly. ben sits on the other side so that hank and jo are between himself and louis. in the rear windows behind them we see the retreating landscape of french morocco.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{how different.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{for josephine. called her jo so long, nobody knows her by any other name.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{i do. mummy.}
<A>__{she smiles at hank, rubs the back of his neck.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{now about the "accident." you see, a moslem woman never takes off her veil in public under any circumstances.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{they feed her intervaneously?}
<A>__{louis looks at the boy with some surprise.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{quite a big word for such a small boy.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm a doctor.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{oh. well, he sounds like one.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{he can spell "haemoglobin" but he has trouble with "cat" and "dog."}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{and where do you practice, doctor?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{indianapolis, indiana. the good samaritan.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) close shot}
<A>__{jo seems to be studying bernard, as if puzzled.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{what brings you to marrakesh?}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. close shot}
<A>__{ben seems happy to talk with somebody new.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{we've been to a medical convention in paris. and while we were in europe, i thought i'd like to see morocco again.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{daddy liberated africa.}
<A>__{louis laughs a little. ben seems uncomfortable.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i was up around casablanca with an army field hospital, that's all.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) close shot}
<A>__{jo his been listening. she seems annoyed at louis bernard's questioning. she interrupts.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{do you live in morocco, mr. bernard?}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. close shot}
<A>__{he smiles at her.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{oh no.}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{i suppose you came directly from paris?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{we looked in on rome and lisbon a few days.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{and casablanca.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i hope you will have time to truly enjoy marrakesh.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{at the most we'll have three days.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you will naturally be stopping at the hotel mamounia or la menara?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{they are hotels for tourists of good taste.}
<A>__{the background, as seen through the windows of the bus, indicates that we are in a built up area.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. shot}
<A>__{it moves through the outskirts of marrakesh, a somewhat more populated section, although the streets are narrow and crowded.}
<L>__{interior bus (day) med. close shot}
<A>__{a persists with louis bernard.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{do you live in france, mr. bernard?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{sometimes.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{do you eat snails.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{when i'm lucky enough to got them.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{if you ever get hungry, our garden back home is full of snails.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{thank you for the invitation.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{that's all right. we tried everything to got rid of them. we never thought of a frenchman.}
<A>__{even jo has to laugh at this, and as the bus continues on into marrakesh, the three see to be fairly good friends brought together by the artless charm of a little boy.}
<L>__{exterior bus (day) med. long shot}
<A>__{the bus moves slowly through the streets busy with bicycle riders, arab women carrying things on their heads, men on foot leading donkeys, an occasional camel, carts, horse drawn carriages carrying elegant moslem women, and ancient french automobiles.}
<L>__{exterior bus (day) med. long shot}
<A>__{the bus circles past the "medina" of marrakesh, the market place with its crowds, vendors, shoppers, beggars, and the curious. it swings in toward the bus stop.}
<L>__{exterior bus stop (day) med. long shot}
<A>__{the bus pulls up to a stop, the door opens, and the passengers begin to file out. the mckennas, together with louis bernard, are the last off the bus. arab helpers have already climbed to the roof of the bus, to unload the baggage. the clean cut airline baggage of the mckennas is in sharp contrast to the hessianroped bundles of the arabs. there are nearby fiacres to take the people to their various destinations in the city, and some small, undersized taxi cabs.}
<L>__{exterior bus stop (day) med. close shot}
<A>__{hank rubs his backside a little.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{next time take the train.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(to louis)}
<D>__{would you like to share our taxi to the hotel?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{that's kind of you, doctor, but unfortunately i have some business first.}
<A>__{jo tries to be casual.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{what business are you in, mr. bernard?}
<A>__{but he has turned his head and speaks something in arabic to a porter, who begins to gather the mckenna's bags, and one belonging to louis. louis turns to ben.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{however, i will be there later perhaps we might have a drink together.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{all right. but i will serve the drinks in our suite.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{in that case, i will take you to dinner.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no. now that's not a fair bargain.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{but i know marrakesh. i can show you an intriguing arab restaurant where the food is different, and the manner of eating exotic.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(gives in)}
<D>__{well that's what we came here for. okay, jo? simple one of those arabian nights?}
<A>__{ben takes her arm, in a warm gesture.}
<C>__{jo}
<P>__{(smiles agreeably)}
<D>__{okay, but i'm no scheherazade.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you'll do.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{how would you prefer to travel to the hotel? by taxi? fiacre?}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{a wagon! i want to ride in a wagon!}
<A>__{he points out one of the open horse drawn carriages. louis looks to ben for confirmation. ben nods assent. louis turns to the porter, and orders him in arabia to put the mckenna's baggage aboard the first available carriage. he picks up his own small bag.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{au revoir. i look forward to cocktails.}
<A>__{he nods to ben and jo, and pats hank on the head.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{see you later. and thinks again.}
<A>__{louis smiles, turns and casually strolls off toward the center of the market place. hank watches him for a moment, while ben turns to see what is happening to his bags.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{i don't like people who pat me on the head.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(turns to jo)}
<D>__{the carriage awaits, madame.}
<A>__{jo turns from the retreating louis, and steers hank toward ben, the camera pans them to the fiacre.}
<L>__{exterior bus stop (day) medium close shot}
<A>__{the mckennas follow their baggage aboard the carriage.}
<L>__{exterior bus stop (day) close shot}
<A>__{ben settles the excited hank into his seat.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{how do you like this! a horse drawn convertible!}
<A>__{jo looks toward the market place, and something she sees makes her eyes widen with surprise.}
<L>__{exterior market place (day) semi long shot}
<A>__{as seen from jo's viewpoint, over the side of the carriage. the frenchman, louis bernard, is talking wit the arab in the brown robes and white and green hat. the same arab who was assaulting hank verbally on the bus. they are talking pleasantly, and smiling.}
<L>__{exterior bus stop day) close shot}
<A>__{jo turns to call ben's attention to it, when there is a sudden crack of a whip, a shouted command to the horse, and the carriage starts of with an abrupt jerk. it throws her head back. hank screams with delight.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{hold on. hold on! here we go!}
<A>__{the carriage moves into the street with a rapid pace. jo looks again to find louis bernard.}
<L>__{exterior market place (day) semi long shot}
<A>__{louis bernard and the arab have disappeared.}
<L>__{exterior the carriage (day) med. close shot}
<A>__{jo slumps back into the seat, trying to evaluate whit she his seen. the market place recedes in the background. hank is now standing up, holding on to the side of the carriage and watching the sights.}
<C>__{j0}
<D>__{ben i just saw louis bernard talking to that arab.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what arab?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{the one who was shouting at hank for taking the woman's veil. he and the frenchman were talking like old friends.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{all right. let's assume they knew each other, and louis bernard didn't bother to tell us. what does that mean?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{it means mr. bernard is a very mysterious man.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{he struck me as quite normal}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{what do you know about him?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i know his name...and, uh....}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{you see? and he knows you' re an american living in indianapolis, indiana. a doctor at the good samaritan. you have a garden with snails, a wife, a boy who can spell haemoglobin. you went to a medical convention in paris. stopped at rome, lisbon, casablanca. you once served in north africa with an army field hospital }

<A>__{jo shakes her head.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{not talking.}
<C>__{jo }
<D>__{he was asking, you were telling. you might as well have handed him your passport.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what difference does it make? i have nothing to hide.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{maybe mr. bernard has.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{jo. i know this is mysterious morocco. inscrutable natives gliding through twisted, narrow streets, but }

<D>__{oh, ben!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{then relax. you're just mad because he didn't ask any questions about you.}
<A>__{she looks at him briefly without any expression. then she malts into a smile.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{bitter medicine, doctor. but i will swallow it.}
<A>__{the carriage swings into the driveway of the hotel mamounia. it is a rich looking building, elegantly landscaped. the camera pans it to the entrance of the hotel. several hotel employees move quickly to meet it. they help the mckennas descend, and assemble the baggage.}

<A>__{showing ben as he walks slowly along, listening to the man approaching behind him, listening with the back of his head, and with his whole body. the man walking behind is aware of ben. he begins staring at him. ben instinctively clenches his right hand into a fist of preparedness. as the man closes in ben we see that he is rather elderly, sixty years old, perhaps. as the man reaches ben, and passes him, ben's follows him and study him.}
<L>__{exterior london street (day) medium close shot}

<A>__{when ben begins mentioning a killing, chappell jr's face takes on a look of alarm, almost panic. he moves back from ben, watching him like a deadly cobra. ben, however, now convinced that he has the right man in front of him, moves in on him to finish his proposition.}
