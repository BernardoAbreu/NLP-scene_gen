<L>__{interior mrs jennings's house drawing room day}
<A>__{marianne and elinor have changed from their traveling clothes and are having a cup of tea. at least, elinor is. marianne is pacing up and down in front of the window.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{john and fanny are in town. i think we shall be forced to see them.}
<A>__{there is a faint knocking from somewhere. marianne jumps.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i think it was for next door.}
<A>__{marianne looks out of the window.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{yes, you are right.}
<A>__{she sits down with a rueful smile. suddenly a much louder rap is heard and they both jump. we hear a bustling downstairs. marianne can hardly breathe. she goes to the drawing room door, opens it, goes out, comes back in. we hear a man's voice.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{oh, elinor! it is willoughby, indeed it is!}
<A>__{she turns and almost throws herself into the arms of colonel}
<B>__{brandon.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{oh! excuse me, colonel }
<A>__{she leaves the room hastily. elinor is so ashamed of marianne's rudeness that she does not at first notice brandon's mood of tense distress.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{colonel brandon, what a pleasure to see you! have you been in london all this while?}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{i have. how is your dear mother?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{very well, thank you.}

<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{colonel, is there anything }
<A>__{but brandon interrupts her.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{forgive me, miss dashwood, but i have heard reports through town... is it impossible to but i could have no chance of succeeding indeed i hardly know what to do. tell me once and for all, is everything finally resolved between your sister and mr willoughby?}
<A>__{elinor is torn between discomfiture and compassion.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{colonel, though neither one has informed me of their under standing, i have no doubt of their mutual affection.}
<A>__{brandon stands very still.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{thank you, miss dashwood. to your sister i wish all imaginable happiness. to mr willoughby, that he... may endeavour to deserve her.}
<A>__{his tone is heavy with some bitter meaning.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<A>__{but he recollects himself.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{forgive me, i forgive me.}
<A>__{he bows and leaves abruptly. elinor is deeply troubled.}
