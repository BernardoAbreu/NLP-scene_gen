<L>__{exterior house late day}
<A>__{pauline's volvo rolls into the drive. she and claude get out of the front seats. margot climbs out of the back holding a big cake box. no one speaks. malcolm, in a fleece vest and safety goggles, drags a chainsaw toward the oak tree. ingrid runs to her mom.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{he's cutting it down.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{pauline passes maisy reading on the patio.}
<C>__{maisy}
<D>__{my dad's late to pick me up. i hope i'm not a pain.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you're not a pain.}
<A>__{margot sits on the back stairs drinking a glass of wine with ice. the tent is up. the tables and chairs are placed around the lawn. she watches malcolm prepare to take the tree down. she puts her pinky in her ear and twists. claude approaches.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i told paul i didn't want you guys to come.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i thought it was interesting.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{what did paul say?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i think she liked it.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{yeah, right. did you talk about me afterwards?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i can tell you're lying.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{we didn't, mom.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i don't trust her.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{she really loves you. she does.}
<A>__{margot tosses the remainder of her drink into the weeds.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{pauline told me she's very disappointed in you.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{she thinks you laze about the house. ingrid is always offering to help clean or cook. she made bracelets for all the guests. even malcolm puts up the tent. you just wait until everyone else does it for you.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{that's not true.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{it is true. you're never helpful. i wish i had taught you better manners.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i can try to make popovers. if i can remember how.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{don't bother.}
<A>__{she looks at him with grave disappointment.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{why are you looking at me like that?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i just see how much you've changed. your body language. you used to be rounder and more graceful. you're so stiff now. so blase.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(retreating)}
<D>__{i can't explain it.}
<A>__{margot shakes her head. she's suddenly distraught.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{it's okay though.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{claude looks devastated. he starts toward the beach. margot's eyes well up she says, trying to make things better:}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you're still handsome.}
