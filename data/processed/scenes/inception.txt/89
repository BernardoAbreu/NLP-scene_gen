<L>__{exterior same parisian street day}
<A>__{ariadne walks down the crowded street with cobb. cobb looks around at the street, the cafe, approving.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{it's good. you've got the cafe, the layout... you forgot the book shop but pretty much everything else is here.}
<A>__{ariadne looks at the passers by.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{who are the people?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{they're projections of my subconscious.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{yours?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{sure you are the dreamer, i am the subject. my subconscious populates your world. that's one way we get at a subject's thoughts his mind creates the people, so we can literally talk to his subconscious.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{how else do you do it?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{architecture. build a bank vault or a jail, something secure, and the subject's mind will fill it with information he's trying to protect.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{then you break in and steal it.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{exactly.}
<A>__{ariadne wonders at the detail of the street.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{i love the concrete sense of things }
<P>__{(stamps foot)}
<D>__{real weight, you know? i thought a dream space would be all about the visual, but it's the feel of things. question is, what happens as you start to mess with physics...}
<A>__{she concentrates on the street. the street starts to bend in half the buildings on either side folding in until they form the inside of a cube of city, gravity functioning independently on each plane. ariadne looks up (or down) at the people on the opposite city surface. cobb watches her excitement.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{it's something, isn't it?}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{yes. it is.}
<A>__{as they walk, ariadne notices more and more of the projections staring at her.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{why are they looking at me?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{because you're changing things. my subconscious feels that someone else is creating the world. the more you change things, the quicker the projections converge on you.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{converge?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{they feel the foreign nature of the dreamer, and attack like white blood cells fighting an infection.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{they're going to attack us?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{just you, actually.}
<A>__{they walk along the street to where it joins the next gravitational plane. they step up onto the different plane and walk down the street towards a river. as ariadne approaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and she leads cobb up onto a small jetty. as she concentrates, pillars emerge and a bridge starts to telescope out from the jetty. they step onto it as it grows. cobb is impressed.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{it's beautiful... but if you keep on changing things...}
<A>__{people crossing the bridge stare at ariadne. several of them bump her shoulder as they pass.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{that's why it's called subconscious. i don't control it.}
<A>__{the bridge now spans the seine. cobb marvels at it.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{arched stone, iron pillars... it's...}
<A>__{cobb pauses, thinking. remembering. insert cut: mal, hair blowing, turns to cobb, smiling, laughing. he smiles back. they are on the same bridge.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i know this bridge. this place is real }
<P>__{(serious)}
<D>__{you didn't imagine it, you remembered it...}
<C>__{ariadne}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{i cross it every day on my way to the college.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{never recreate places from your memory. always imagine new places.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{you have to draw from what you know }
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(tense)}
<D>__{use pieces a streetlamp, phonebooths, a type of brick not whole areas.}
<A>__{several people around them echo cobb's attitude...}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{because building dreams out of your own memories is the surest way to lose your grip on what's real and what's a dream.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{did that happen to you?}
<A>__{cobb says nothing. he stands there, starinq at ariadne. people around her stop and look at her, hostile.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{look, this isn't about me }
<A>__{cobb reaches for ariadne's arm, turns her to him }
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{is that why you need me to build your dreams?}
<A>__{a passerby grabs ariadne's shoulder }
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{leave her alone }
<A>__{more of the crowd join in, pulling at ariadne, holding her arms open cobb pulls people off the crowd pushes him away cobb sees someone walking purposefully through the crowd towards the helpless, ariadne it is mal. she approaches with even strides ariadne stares at her, uneasy.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{wake me up, cobb.}
<A>__{as mal walks, she pulls out a large knife }
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{mal, no!}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{wake me up!}
<A>__{ariadne screams as mal lunges at her with the knife and we }
