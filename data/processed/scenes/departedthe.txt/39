<L>__{interior conference room. day}
<A>__{on the wall is a rogues gallery of costello and all his primary guys...mister french, delahunt, fitzy. colin and others sitting listening. colin, reading a paper (boston herald) which may or may not have the headline, case dropped against drugs cadet (featuring a picture of billy), looks up as sgt. dignam comes in.}
<C>__{sgt. dignam}
<D>__{sorry i'm late.}
<C>__{ellerby}
<D>__{staff sergeant dignam is our liaison with the undercover section. their undercover work is extensive. he's here to give us his report. sgt. dignam.}
<C>__{sgt. dignam}
<D>__{ok. they're out there, my people. they're like the fuckin' indians. you're not gonna see them. you're not gonna hear about them except through me or captain queenan. you will not, ever, know the identity of undercover people. this shit hole, unfortunately, has more fuckin' leaks than the iraqi navy.}
<C>__{ellerby}
<D>__{fuck yourself.}
<C>__{sgt. dignam}
<D>__{i'm tired from fucking your wife.}
<C>__{ellerby}
<D>__{how's your mother?}
<C>__{sgt. dignam}
<D>__{good. she's tired from fucking my father.}
<P>__{(opens a file)}
<D>__{ok, today, girls, what i got for you is microprocessors.}
<A>__{lazio, the fed, comes in and sits down. with folders, pencil.}
<C>__{sgt. dignam }
<D>__{somebody, as you may already know, stole one hundred microprocessors from the mass processor corp out route 128. they're the kind of processors they put into computers that can put a cruise missile up the ass of a camel from the other side of the planet. that's what they do out there on "america's technology highway". worth a hundred grand apiece. guy worked for the company two months walked out the door with a box of processors on tuesday, has a ticket booked for florida on wednesday, but on thursday he gets found in a dumpster. you know where this dirt ball started his life? southie projects.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{what was his name? the, ah, departed.}
<C>__{sgt. dignam}
<D>__{myles kennefick. got the job with a forged umass transcript. umass boston, which incidentally happens to be in...}
<C>__{lazio}
<D>__{south boston?}
<C>__{sgt. dignam}
<D>__{who forged your transcript, dickhead?}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{i know that guy. his father runs the hibernian liquor mart. kennefick's.}
<C>__{ellerby}
<D>__{we are not here to solve the "case of the dead scumbag". we are here to nail costello.}
<A>__{colin stands down, embarrassed.}
<C>__{sgt. dignam}
<D>__{we got a guy says that he hears costello is moving the processors to china...that he set up the whole fuckin' job and popped kennefick.}
<P>__{(lazio is writing, lawyerish.)}
<D>__{you don't want to miss it if costello takes a dump.}
<C>__{ellerby}
<D>__{we'd miss less if your informants were available to us, and of course to the fbi (bureau)...}
<C>__{lazio}
<D>__{without asking for details, do you have anyone in with costello presently?}
<C>__{sgt. dignam}
<D>__{maybe. maybe not. maybe fuck yourself. my theory on feds is they're like mushrooms. feed 'em shit and keep in the dark. you girls have a nice day.}
