<A>__{the sound of a motor grows in volume, then abruptly ceases. the trappers' jeep appears in the snowfall on the road into town. it coasts quietly in and stops behind the cover of a woodpile across from wilder's cabin. the trappers get out of the jeep. lemalle has eric's remington, mitchell has his peacemaker, and viking bob carries lemalle's old carbine. mitchell spits. it's so cold outside that the spittle freezes and cracks before it hits the ground. they fan out and approach wilder's cabin.}

<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{ben? ben corbett?}
<A>__{no response. carbine held at his hip, viking bob walks up to the door and, with a mighty kick, breaks it in. reverse angle through wilder's cabin door viking bob points the carbine at an empty room. he notices, however, corbett's duffel bag on the floor of the cell.}
