<A>__{the vocal jazz group is belting their hearts out, singing "how sweet it is." oz sings with them now in his vocal jazz outfit...we tilt down to see he's still wearing his cleats. he and heather sound great, backed by the vocal jazz group. they sail through their duet, join hands, and finish perfectly. the audience applauds with enthusiasm and we kevin and jim, whooping and clapping, loving it, like they're at a rock concert.}
