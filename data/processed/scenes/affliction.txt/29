<L>__{exterior woods day}
<A>__{snowprints lead from jack's pickup to where he and twombley walk, guns pointed skyward. they enter a line of trees. jack watches twombley walk ahead of him, wrapped like a huge infant in red bunting, crunching twigs underfoot. he looks from side to side, checks his gun, returns to watching twombley. they're alone.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{safety on?}
<A>__{twombley nods, slips, thumps to the ground. his rifle lands silently. jack sprints over, helps him up, safety latches the winchester. hands it back.}
