<A>__{i e. humvee later the sun beats down violently as the hummer rolls along. epps, jaeger and wes all ride along in an angry silence. jaeger starts to smile. he chuckles to himself. epps, looking for anything to break the tension smiles a bit himself.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing. i mean if they knew what we were coming back with.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you can't tell anybody about this.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i know. i know. but i'm saying, if they knew. we're going to be millionaires, man. millionaires!}
<A>__{epps joins in cackling like a hyena.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it'd make their heads explode.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{millionaires, man.}
<A>__{he turns back to wes.}
<D>__{jaeger(cont} you know we're going to be rich. admit it. you know. come on, admit it.}
<A>__{in spite of himself wes gives a little smile.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{ahh, there it is. there it is. you know it.}
<A>__{singing to levert:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{money, money, money, money...money.}
<A>__{jaeger joins in.}
<D>__{epps jaeger money, money, money, money...money.}
<A>__{epps starts to slow down.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what are you doing.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{low on gas. got to refill.}
<A>__{a nervous look punches it way onto jaeger's face. epps stops. he and wes jump out of the hummer and go around back to the reserve tanks. jaeger stays in the vehicle looking all tense. after a beat epps screams for him.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{jaeger...jaeger!}
<A>__{time to face the music. jaeger hauls himself out of the hummer and goes around to epps who's got a look on his face like he's just had a spoonful of steaming shit. he points angrily at one of the reserve tanks.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{look at it. look at it! shot to hell. it's been leaking gas since the fire fight. i told you to check for damage.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{...i know.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{and you missed this? how are you going to miss something like this?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i didn't miss it. i figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{so, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel? knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{...i figured...i figured you'd turn back.}
<A>__{wes gets a slow boil on.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{...you stupid son of a bitch.}
<A>__{wes lunges for jaeger, but doesn't have the speed or the skills. jaeger counters, and sinks a fist into wes' jaw. wes goes down, but he manages to take jaeger to the sand with him. they start to scrape, but it's obvious jaeger has got the upper hand. epps reaches down and yanks jaeger off of wes.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{get off him.}
<A>__{jaeger comes up to his feet. wes wipes some blood from his lips. he looks down at his bloodied hand, then sneers at jaeger.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you two fighting's not going to get us anything.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{we're not stranded. we've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{then lets go back while we still can.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{as soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway. we're not that far. we can make it.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what do we do with the humvee?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{we leave it.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what if someone takes it?}
<A>__{jaeger throws his arms wide to the empty desert.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{who? who's going to take it. we mark the location with the navicom, we can come right back to this spot.}
<A>__{wes has had enough.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you two don't even know how crazy you are. you want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{you have to go with us, wes.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{really? what is that, an order,}
<A>__{private ?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{you have to go with us. you can't walk back...}
<A>__{jaeger dangles the keys to the humvee from a finger.}
<P>__{jaeger{cont)}
<D>__{and you sure as hell aren't going to drive.}
<A>__{wes burns a hole through jaeger's head with his eyes. epps steps to him.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{load what you can; water, tools, weapons. anything you think we might need.}
<A>__{wes burns on a bit more, then turns and heads for the hummer. jaeger watches him go, then smiles to himself.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{who's he kidding? he wants it as bad as we do. we're going to be fat, epps. as soon as we get back to saudivillie you and me are going to }
<A>__{epps gets up in jaeger's face. the menace he projects is very real.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we're going to keep going 'cause i want some of whatever's out there. but you ever pull something like trying to get my ass stranded out here again, and i will kill you myself. you got that?}
<A>__{jaeger just stands there, his fear swelling.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{say it!}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i got that...sir.}
<A>__{epps storms over towards the hummer leaving jaeger to be all scared with himself.}
