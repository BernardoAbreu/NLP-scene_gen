<L>__{exterior robben island day}
<A>__{robben island lies only eight miles from the mainland. it is two miles long, with sandy beaches full of penguins and seals. it would be pretty but for its maximum security prison. concrete, barbed wire, guard towers. (in 1995, the political prisoner wing was shut, but the island still housed criminal prisoners, so the island still had the feel of real incarceration. today, it is a tourist destination.)}
