<A>__{questular and kwaltz watch their front screen as the heart of gold blasts into hyperspace.}
<C>__{kwaltz}
<D>__{did they have proper hyperspace authorization?}
<C>__{vogon worker}
<D>__{no, commander.}
<C>__{kwaltz}
<D>__{add that to their list of offences!}
<P>__{(scoffing)}
<D>__{blatant disregard for protocol.}
<C>__{questular}
<D>__{you do realize he did what he did because he knew this is what you would do.}
<C>__{kwaltz}
<D>__{rules are rules, mr. vice president. and they are made to be followed.}
<A>__{questular looks up to the screen at all the vogon ships.}
<C>__{questular}
<D>__{don't you think this many ships is a bit, oh i don't know excessive?}
<C>__{kwaltz}
<D>__{the provisions are clear. under subsection 37a these are the forces we deploy to protect the president in the case of an attempted or actual kidnapping }
<A>__{he holds up one fat official book with one hand.}

<C>__{kwaltz}
<D>__{i don't have ideas mr. vice president. i just do what i do.}
<A>__{a vogon messenger runs up holding papers. kwaltz takes them, signs one in two places, initials others, lifts the top sheet, removes the pink copy. folds it. he does this for the other two forms as well. questular watches dumbfounded as kwaltz hands the papers back to the messenger who turns and runs off.}
