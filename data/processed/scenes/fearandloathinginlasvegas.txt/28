<L>__{exterior desert day}
<B>__{in the bronco.}
<A>__{duke hangs on with his beer. nothing all around but the huge impenetrable cloud of dust. lacerda snaps madly away at nothing at all!}
<C>__{lacerda}
<D>__{i will just keep trying different combos of film and lenses till i find one that works in this dust!}
<A>__{the sound of motorcycles racing... we hear music and voices singing:}
<C>__{battle hymn}
<D>__{"...as we go marching on when i reach my final campground, in that land beyond the sun, and the great commander asks me..." [what did he ask you, rusty?] "did you fight or did you run?"}
<A>__{a moment later, the bronco races out of the dust. duke coughs, chokes, drinks beer.}
<C>__{battle hymn}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{[and what did you tell them, rusty?] "we responded to their rifle fire with everything we had..."}
<A>__{the sound of gun shots... a dune buggy races toward them, loaded down with three retired petty officers, drunk as hell. the radio blares: "the battle hymn of lieutenant calley." the dune buggy is covered with ominous symbols: screaming eagles carrying american flags in their claws. a slant eyed snake being chopped to bits by a buzz saw made of stars and stripes. a machine gun mount on the passenger side. they yell over the roaring engines.}
<C>__{dune buggy driver}
<D>__{where's the damn race?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{beats me. we're just good patriotic americans like yourself.}
<A>__{duke gives dune buggy passenger #2 a nice big grin. in response, the passenger #2 narrows his eyes tightens his grip on an automatic weapon.}
<C>__{dune buggy driver}
<P>__{(suspiciously)}
<D>__{what outfit you fellas with?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{the sporting press. we're friendlies. hired geeks.}
<A>__{the driver and dune buggy passenger #2 exchange looks.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{if you want a good chase, you should get after that skunk from cbs news up ahead in the black jeep. he's the man responsible for that book, the selling of the pentagon. dune buggy passenger #1 hot damn! dune buggy passenger #2 a black jeep, you say?}
<A>__{and they roar away.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{take me back to the pits.}
<C>__{lacerda}
<D>__{no, no we have to go on. we need total coverage.}
<A>__{duke gets out of the bronco.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{you're fired.}
<A>__{after a moment's hesitation, lacerda and the bronco driver roar away leaving duke alone in the cloud of dust.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{it was time. i felt, for an agonizing reappraisal of the whole scene. the race was definitely under way. i had witnessed the start; i was sure of that much. but what now?}
