<A>__{as white boy bob gets maybe half way up when he catches a toe on one of the risers and pitches forward. stupidly, he tries to break his fall with the elbow of his gun hand and ends up jamming his chin down onto the muzzle of his gun which, unfortunately for him, goes off, firing a bullet through his head and killing him instantly. to say the least, foley is stunned by this freak accident. he stands there looking at the dead bulk on the stairs.}
