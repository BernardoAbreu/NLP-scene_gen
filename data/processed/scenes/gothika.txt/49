<A>__{miranda hangs her head under the spray and closes her eyes, trying to shut it all out. the sounds slowly fade out : until all we have is miranda and her ragged breathing. chloe and shelley, the last two out from the previous group, grab towels. chloe winks at miranda when she catches her staring, but miranda is not staring at her. she is staring past her at the tile wall. more specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted water pipe pokes out. clearly at some point there was a handle there, but now it is just a hole with a busted pipe. push into the hole to see a perfectly formed globule of blood emerge, following by a gurgling sound which seems to come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing system. the blood lingers tentatively, as if unfamiliar with the laws of gravity, before tracing an upward line along the tile. the gurgling grows louder, closer, and now more blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall. miranda looks away, disturbed, and now realizes she is the only one left in the showers. panic. shuts her eyes.}

<D>__{it isn't real. you're hallucinating.}
<A>__{perhaps. but now blood drips by her ankle, drip, drip, drip. and the shooting pain she feels is coming from her arm. what the hell ? we see sharp slashes appearing on her skin, like some invisible knife is slicing her. hallucination or not, she bolts out of the showers }
