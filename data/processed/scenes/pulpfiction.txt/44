<L>__{interior bathroom (marsellus wallace's house) night}
<A>__{vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to himself in the mirror.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{one drink and leave. don't be rude, but drink your drink quickly, say goodbye, walk out the door, get in your car, and go down the road.}
<B>__{living room}
<A>__{mia has the unbeknownst to her heroin cut up into big lines on her glass top coffee table. taking her trusty hundred dollar bill like a human dust buster, she quickly snorts the fat line.}
<B>__{closeup mia}
<A>__{her head jerks back. her hands go to her nose (which feels like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. then... the rush hits...}
<B>__{bathroom}
<A>__{vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his dialogue with the mirror.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{...it's a moral test of yourself, whether or not you can maintain loyalty. because when people are loyal to each other, that's very meaningful.}
<B>__{living room}
<A>__{mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from her knees. blood begins to drip from mia's nose. then her stomach gets into the act and she vomits.}
<B>__{bathroom}
<A>__{vince continues.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{so you're gonna go out there, drink your drink, say "goodnight, i've had a very lovely evening," go home, and jack off. and that's all you're gonna do.}
<A>__{now that he's given himself a little pep talk, vincent's ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of that door. so he goes through it.}
<B>__{living room}
<A>__{we follow behind vincent as he walks from the bathroom to the living room, where he finds mia lying on the floor like a rag doll. she's twisted on her back. blood and puke are down her front. and her face is contorted. not out of the tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. slack jawed.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{jesus christ!}
<A>__{vincent moves like greased lightning to mia's fallen body. bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck to check her pulse. she slightly stirs. mia is aware of vincent over her, speaking to her.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(sounding weird)}
<D>__{mia! mia! what the hell happened?}
<A>__{but she's unable to communicate mia makes a few lost mumbles, but they're not distinctive enough to be called words. vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{i will be a son of a bitch.}
<P>__{(to mia)}
<D>__{mia! mia! what did you take? answer me honey, what did you take?}
<A>__{mia is incapable of answering. he slaps her face hard. vincent springs up and runs to his overcoat, hanging on the rack. he goes through the pockets frantically. it's gone. vincent makes a beeline to mia. we follow.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(yelling to mia)}
<D>__{okay honey, we're getting you on your feet.}
<A>__{he reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{we're on our feet now, and now we're gonna talk out to the car. here we go, watch us walk.}
<A>__{we follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically unconscious mia through the house and out the front door.}
