<A>__{the attendant swaggers over to the car. ferris slips him a give.}

<D>__{you speak english?}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{since i was three.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{great. i want to you take extra special care of this vehicle, okay?}
<A>__{he pats the attendant on the arm. he smiles.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{like it's a beautiful woman.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{i appreciate it.}
<A>__{the attendant very gingerly gets into the car. ferris turns to cameron. the ferrari pulls into the lot very slowly, very carefully. no squealing tires, no revving engine.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{see what a finski can do to a person's attitude? he's going to treat it like a beautiful woman.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{yeah, sure. whip it with a stick and piss on the hood.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{oh, please, cameron. do you have to be so graphic?}
<A>__{she heads down the street.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{this is so right!}
<A>__{ferris nudges cameron on. they exit the garage and head after sloane. a long beat and the ferrari creeps down the exit ramp of the garage. it's gone in the entrance and out the exit. another attendant jumps in the passenger side. he's skinny, tall, with a huge knit hat willed with dreads. he lets out a spirited laugh and the ferrari peels out of the lot. it heads down the street away from sloane, ferris and cameron.}
