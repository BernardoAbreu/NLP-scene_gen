<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i knew about jim.}
<C>__{phelps}
<D>__{but, he didn't know about you. in all fairness, ethan, claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. but i was supremely confident having tastes the goods. "thou shall not covet thy neighbour's wife", ethan. oh, ethan is in love with you, claire, make no mistake about it. and like all the world's lovers, he's tortured by the same, one pathetic question "does she feel the same way i do?"}
<A>__{jim turns to claire.}
<C>__{phelps}
<D>__{well claire do you? have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?}
<C>__{claire}

<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{aren't you going to thank me jim. ten million is better than six.}
<C>__{phelps}
<D>__{don't flatter yourself six was for eastern europe. you made a lousy deal ten for the world? what is that? but i needed you for the transfer with max. i got a little extra change; and you got a little extra too.}
<A>__{phelp's watch alarm goes off.}
<C>__{phelps}
<D>__{sorry ethan. times up. say goodbye.}
