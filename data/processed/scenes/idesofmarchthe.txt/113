<L>__{interior pullman headquarters cincinnati night}
<A>__{stephen enters the offices, staffers look up and recognize him.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{where's duffy...}
<C>__{staffer 1}
<D>__{you got an appointment?}
<A>__{stephen keeps walking. stephen arrives at a medium sized, glass partitioned office. as he looks in, we see duffy and five or six staffers around a table. duffy is holding court, the mood is light. duffy notices stephen standing there. duffy walks stephen a few doors down to a conference room. a single staffer is working on a laptop.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{joe can you excuse us for a minute.}
<A>__{the staffer leaves and duffy closes the door.}
<C>__{duffy }
<D>__{not very bright, walking in here...}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i'm in. i'm coming to work for you.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{a reporter at roll call phoned me this afternoon.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i know who leaked it.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{paul.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{you told paul?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{yeah. i told him we met. he leaked it.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{you shouldn't have told him that.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i felt like i should.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{i've worked with paul. he gets paranoid.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{obviously.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{so he fired you.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i quit.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{you're lying to me...come on...}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i quit! and i can give you everything on morris. everything.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{i can lay out his whole strategy for you.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{i already know his strategy. paul gave it all to thompson.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{what if i had something else?}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{you'd do that to morris? to paul?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{revenge makes people unpredictable steve. i can't have someone who's unpredictable. who's unstable.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{i'm not unstable.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{if it had been a clean break if you'd left morris before this story broke, that'd be one thing. that we could control. but the way it'd look now paul fires you and then you come work for us. looks like we're picking up the scraps. puts morris in the drivers seat. i can't have that.}
<A>__{we see a shot close on stephen's clinched fist holding the yellow copies from molly's clinic visit down by his side. we pan up to his face.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{what if i had something big?}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{something big. something that'll bring morris down.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{give me the job.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{it's not gonna happen. i'm sorry. go take a nice long vacation.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{duffy }
<D>__{you're a smart guy steve. everything i said yesterday is true. but maybe politics isn't for you.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{politics is my life.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{do yourself a favor. get out now while you still can. go into entertainment, or business, or open a fucking restaurant in costa rica anything. do what will make you happy. you stay in this business long enough it makes you jaded and cynical.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{like you?}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{yeah. just like me.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you knew i was gonna tell paul.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{i didn't know. i thought you might, but i didn't know.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you knew if i told him he'd fire me.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{thing you gotta know about paul he's big on loyalty.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{yeah i got a nice speech on that. you were never gonna hire me.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{put yourself in my shoes steve. your opponent has the best media mind in the country working on his team. what do you try to do? you either try to hire him yourself, or work it so if you can't have him, the other team can't either. this was a win win situation for me. you work for us great. paul doesn't have you. then again, if paul fires you and i don't take you fine paul still doesn't have you. either way i win. the moment i got you to sit down in that chair, i knew i'd won.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{this is my life you're talking about.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{it's not easy for me to do this sort of thing steve. don't think i take any pleasure in it. i'm sorry for you. i really am. take care of yourself.}
