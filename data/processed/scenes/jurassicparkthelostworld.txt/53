<L>__{interior tent hunter's camp night}
<A>__{in the hunters' supply tent, a case of twelve year old scotch sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition. peter ludlow reaches in and pulls a bottle out.}
<L>__{exterior jungle night}
<A>__{in the jungle, ludlow approaches a small clearing. roland is bent over a small stake in the ground, chaining something to it. as ludlow approaches and walks around him, he sees what protest. roland looks up.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{offering a little incentive.}
<A>__{ludlow laughs and shakes his head. he takes a drink and offers roland one. roland accepts. ludlow notices roland's gun leaning against a tree.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{what kind of gun is that?}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{my father's .600 nitro express. made in 1904. karimojo bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant. 8700 foot pound striking force.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{how close do you have to be?}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{forty yards. less, maybe. i assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?}
<A>__{roland just looks at him.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{or a laser beam from a satellite?}
<A>__{ludlow leans down, close to the baby rex, and examines it while it thrashes on its chain. its mouth has been bound shut with a leather strap.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{you rally think this'll draw the parent?}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{i once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep. all the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. i saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{killing lessons? heartwarming.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{rex won't be any different. it'll come.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{you're kidding yourself. an adult t rex cares about one thing filling its own belly. it acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it. if people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety nine percent would }
<A>__{he stops, an idea on his face.}
<C>__{ludlow }
<D>__{wait. why not? sedatives... growth inhibitors...}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{i hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but i only thought of adults, it never occurred to me }
<P>__{(close to the animal)}
<D>__{you are a billion dollar idea, my little f }
<A>__{crack! the tyrannosaur, even with its jaws clamped shut, lunges at ludlow's face, head butting him right across the bridge of the nose. ludlow staggers back, waiting in pain, clutching his bleeding face. roland laughs. ludlow, like an enraged child, snatches up roland's gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rex's leg. the bone breaks with a dry snap and the animal howls in pain. roland lunges and throws ludlow to the ground, but the damage is done.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{what the hell you do that for?!}
<A>__{as his pain eases, ludlow feels a bit foolish, but he attempts to cover.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{had to. to keep him still for the trip.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{you've broken its leg!}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{we've got to transport it seven thousand miles. would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?}
<A>__{he gets up, brushes himself off, and heads back to the camp, trying to salvage his dignity. roland watches him go.}
