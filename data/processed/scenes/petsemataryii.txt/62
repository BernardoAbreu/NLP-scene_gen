<L>__{interior geoff's house, living room night}
<A>__{chase enters and stops in the doorway. geoff sits in front of the television with a pile of videotapes next to him. he's scanning through renee's old movies with the remote. the sound has been turned down and the effect is a little eerie.}
<B>__{on the screen}
<A>__{we see renee move through a scene. geoff hits the slo mo button and the image winds down. renee's face. her eyes stare out at us from the alien universe of the past.}
<C>__{chase}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{geoff...}
<A>__{geoff doesn't respond. he's captivated by renee. chase moves into the room.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{geoff!}
<A>__{geoff pauses the tape. renee freezes, the image flickering ever so slightly. for an instant, we think we see a flash of renee being electrocuted. but it's only an instant. finally, geoff tears his eyes away from the screen, resenting his father's intrusion.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{you alright?}
<A>__{geoff's face softens. he nods.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{dad... do you think...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...you think you and mom would've gotten back together?}
<A>__{chase draws closer. he takes a seat next to geoff. the pain in his son's eyes is almost more than he can stand.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{chase}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{your mom and i loved each other, geoff. don't ever think that we didn't.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{i still can't believe she's dead...}
<A>__{chase moves to reach for his son, and suddenly the phone rings, shattering the moment. chase hesitates, but finally he rises and answers the phone. after a moment, he returns.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{who was that?}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{remember zowie, drew's dog? he got hurt again. i'm going over to take a look at him.}
<A>__{geoff's eyes widen. he looks like a ghost walked over his grave.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{i'm going with you.}
<A>__{chase nods and exits to get his coat. geoff looks back at the tv once more. the image paused. renee staring at us from beyond the grave.}
