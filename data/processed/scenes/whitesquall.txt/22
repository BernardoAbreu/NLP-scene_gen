<L>__{interior head}
<A>__{pissed, john tries to figure out the head. pumps going in, pumps going out.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{we were all thirteen individuals. we'd arrived the sum total of our limited experiences and the result of our parents' best, if not narrow, expectations...}
<A>__{john pulls back on the lever, belching "water de le toilet" all over him.}
<L>__{exterior ship day}
<A>__{chuck sits in a bowswain's chair over the side, with a paint roller in his hand. the rust streaked hull is being transformed.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{... some of us were there for discipline, some for escape. but i could see a small piece of myself in all of them and though i fought the notion, for me, i knew now, this would be home.}
<A>__{a radio crackles in the b.g.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{"president eisenhower today acknowledged that a secret american spy plane was in fact shot down over the soviet union. the pilot has been confirmed as francis gary powers..."}
<A>__{robin, terry and mike, are on the deck within earshot of chuck with chisels and wire brushes chipping away at the rust.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{why couldn't it have been a wooden boat?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{steel boats don't leak.}
<A>__{mike lights up a cigarette. robin notices. marlboro's.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{hey, can i have one?}
<A>__{mike sizes up robin for a moment then tosses him the pack.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{thanks daddy o.}
<A>__{robin lights up, grimacing with the first drag.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{well, don't brush too hard. looks to me like the only thing holding this bucket together is the rust.}
<A>__{a voice booms up from the dock.}
<C>__{francis }
<D>__{ahoy there.}
<A>__{they turn. standing on the dock is francis boutillier, self important and overbearing, with his son, philip, who looks as if this whole ordeal is some kind of punishment. skipper appears.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{good afternoon.}
<A>__{francis boards without being invited. philip follows in his shadow. he scrutinizes the condition of the boat.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{albatross? doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{oh, on the contrary, the albatross is considered a very good omen. it is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on. it's very bad luck if you kill one. and dolphins too.}
<A>__{the boys chuckle.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{i'm francis boutillier. this is my son, philip.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{francis looks the skipper over, reading him, smiling.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{you're a day late. we keep a schedule aboard ship. lives depend on it.}
<P>__{(to philip)}
<D>__{hello, philip.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{sir.}
<A>__{skipper's directness bugs francis.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid october.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{as you can see, there's a lot to do.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{this is a working ship. promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her. had we been ready, i can assure you we would have sailed.}
<A>__{something in this exchange turns the tone of conversation.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{and i would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{happily, it all worked out... this time.}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{bill, take philip below and help him find a bunk.}
<A>__{phil follows bill down the companionway.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{i will be frank with you. this was his mother's idea. a romp through the caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{it will be more than that, i can promise you.}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(cool)}
<D>__{take good care of my son.}
<A>__{there is threat in his tone.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{we'll do our best. you're welcome to say goodbye.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{he's a big boy.}
<A>__{francis leaves the boat. skipper and the crew watch as he climbs into his waiting embassy limousine and drives off.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{well, that was neighborly.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{he didn't get to be under secretary of the air force by being neighborly.}
<A>__{lawford shakes his head. bill comes up through the companionway.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{everyone aboard young bill?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{good.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{let's go sailing.}
