<A>__{as rachel comes in with elaine's coffee, closes the door behind her. elaine is lying across the bed, sobbing.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i brought your coffee.}
<A>__{she takes a seat next to the bed.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't mean it that way.}
<A>__{after a moment, elaine starts to pull herself together:}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<P>__{(and)}
<D>__{look, i shouldn't have blown my top. it's like... somehow... i've let everything get away from me. and you sort of made me face it.}
<A>__{she takes the cup, sips the coffee. rachel smiles at a private thought.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{what's so funny?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{fred. the way he looked when you screamed at him.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(disparing)}
<D>__{god, fred...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{at home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{no? why not?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you just wouldn't. it's not the amish way.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{but i think it would have done me good if i could have screamed at your brother last night.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{listen, i don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?}
<A>__{rachel smiles.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{okay.}
