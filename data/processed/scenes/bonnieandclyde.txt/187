<L>__{interior sheriff's office in dexter. day.}
<A>__{although the scene begins with a full screen close up of a newspaper clipping with a photo, it is just a blurry gray, crowded scene of blanche's capture. really impossible to make anybody out in the crowd. camera stays on photo as we hear voice over of two men talking: a sheriff and his deputy.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i was in the bunch that took 'er. see here? can you make me out? here i am, see here, right behind joe boyd here.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{sure enough, billy, is that your head there?}
<A>__{camera pulls away, billy, a young deputy cold, intense, humorless and square, carefully folds up the clipping and puts it in his wallet.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{still can't figure how we let them other two get away.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(an older, more genial type)}
<D>__{yeah, seems as how nobody can get 'em somehow.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(sullen)}
<D>__{yeah...well, maybe this boy'll be the one to do it, this hamer guy. boy if he can't do it, sheriff, ain't nobody but the whole u.s. army can do it.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(with a new note of}
<D>__{enthusiasm, gets up and walks to the}
<P>__{window turning to billy)}
<D>__{you hear he quit the rangers on account of texas got that woman governor. said he wouldn't work under no woman.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(respectfully)}
<D>__{yeah, that's somethin' all right. say, how many they say he shot anyway in his day?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{sixty five they say.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{son of a sea cook!}
<A>__{the door opens. we see, full shot and then fast close up frank hamer. it should be a complete shock to the audience this is the man kidnapped by the gang earlier and partially destroyed by bonnie. hamer is dressed in his ranger outfit and hat, and again he has that quality of sinister frenzy beneath his calm manner. his attitude toward these lawmen is sheer condescension, friendly only out of convention, really superior and contemptuous of lesser workers in his field.}
<C>__{hamer}
<P>__{(with politeness arising from condescension)}
<D>__{excuse me, am i in the right place? is this sheriff smoot?}
<A>__{pete and billy jump up from the chairs and walk over to hamer, hands extended. they are quite impressed by meeting in the flesh.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(mispronouncing his name)}
<D>__{frank hammer. i sure am pleased to meet you!}
<P>__{(shakes his hand)}
<C>__{hamer}
<D>__{hamer.}
