<A>__{quaritch glances up to see a squadron of winged shapes, diving out of the morning glare like birds of prey. close on jake, rushing straight down, screaming a war cry as he leads the charge and scores of banshees slam into the gunships and samsons like falcons hitting fat turkeys. the air battle is joined. jake's great leonopteryx flairs into its signature crimson x shape just before k wham!! it knocks a scorpion tumbling. it coils around the gunship, slashing furiously as they spin together. jake can barely hang onto the gyrating creature. the pilot of the scorpion sees nothing but jaws slamming into his canopy. jake releases the gunship and it careens into a cliff, tearing off one rotor then plummets into the trees. there is a satisfying fireball. scorpions fall out of formation to pursue individual banshee riders, firing cannons and rockets. jake banks as the cliff face next to him explodes with cannon rounds. screaming down on him is another scorpion. jake tucks and dives along the cliff, feeling the rounds splitting the air around him and the scorpions bank after the furiously jinking banshees as they head for cover among the floating mountains, or dive down into the trees. door gunners in a samson are shooting down banshees like messerschmidts from a b 17 as we follow tsu'tey's banshee in a full delta dive. he swoops in from its blind spot and the gunners swivel too late as tsu'tey flashes past them, shooting arrows with deadly accuracy. a scorpion gunship dives after a banshee. it fires an air to air missile and the banshee vanishes in an explosion. wide shot as thirty ships and hundreds of banshees wheel and dive, like the battle of britain. banshees are hit by guns and missiles, falling out of the sky. the occasional trail of smoke and fire marks the demise of a tilt rotor. in the center the dragon is pouring out hellacious fire tracer rounds from multiple turrets and missiles from the stub wing pods. neytiri banks hard as tracers flash past her. a scorpion is right on her ass as she rolls inverted and dives under the edge of mons veritatis, then rolls out, zig zagging through the dangling vines but the gunship stays on her. it rips through the vines, and tracers flash toward us as she jinks the banshee around a thundering waterfall but her pursuer explodes right through the curtain of water. it launches an air to air missile. neytiri jinks hard, diving. the missile hits a rock outcropping, pummeling her with the shock wave. the gunship follows her through a narrow slit between mons veritatis and a smaller floating island. they run this slot rolled up on their sides and the scorpion gunner locks up neytiri for a missile shot but a shadow crosses his canopy. out of the sun comes a crimson demon, shrieking over the roar of the turbines, and k whammm!! the leonopteryx slams the gunship, driving it downward in a dive. the leonopteryx lashes at it with claws and teeth as they fall together out of control. jake kicks the gunship loose and it falls like a brick, breaking its back on a rocky promontory and exploding. flying with a samson as a second samson falls in beside it. this one has its pilot door off, and the pilot is wearing a breathing mask. the door gunners wave at trudy, her expression grim behind her mask. she holds the cyclic stick between her knees while she rakes the other ship with bursts from an ar in her lap. the pilot slumps over and the craft tumbles out of control.}
