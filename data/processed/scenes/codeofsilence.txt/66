<A>__{the machine in question looks like a miniature tank. this is the "prowler," a robot anti terrorist vehicle that is being maneuvered around various obstacles in a demonstration for the city's law enforcement agencies. the "prowler" is amazingly agile. and its bullhorn voice breaks everybody up.}

<D>__{arretez! halten zie! stop! do not move! no se mueve!...}
<A>__{the machine's three video eyes, searching the crowd independently, give it the appearance of an extra industrial bug. one camera is mounted on a telescoping mast which extends to give it the perspective of a giraffe. the thing seems almost alive. commander kates is here, leading a contingent of departmental brass. with them are several dozen officers and a gaggle of city councilmen. the prowler is being put through its paces by the factory engineer. he controls the machine with a pistol grip device that looks like a small tv camera.}

<D>__{...after the gyros are locked, any movement of the hand controller is duplicated by the 'prowler.'}
<A>__{he turns his hand to the right and the prowler, 50 yards away, sweeps its turret to the right, aiming the twin 30 calibre machineguns at the politicians. they move aside.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{this simple control system means that even semi skilled employees can operate the unit with a minimum of training. as they say, "even a child can operate it."}
<A>__{standing with chief kates, eddie watches the demonstration with contempt. kates turns to him.}

<D>__{he's talking about you, cusack. pay attention. you're all gonna have to be qualified on this. it's the future.}

<D>__{just what the world needs, another gun without a brain.}
<C>__{kates}
<D>__{you're looking at the perfect cop. the damn thing follows orders.}
<A>__{eddie has seen enough.}

<D>__{i got better things to do than play with toys.}
<A>__{kates is about to say something when the demonstrator interrupts.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{if the commander will pick someone to try and elude 'prowler,' we can show how our various target acquisition systems function.}
<A>__{kates points to eddie, and smiles. instantly the turret sweeps the horizon and locks on eddie as he walks across the astro turf. close up of the prowler's hand controller. the monitor screen shows the crosshairs on the back of eddie's head. on the screen the digital readout says: locked and}

<D>__{bang. you're dead.}
<A>__{eddie keeps walking, seemingly oblivious to the prowler. suddenly he whirls and ducks behind a wall out of the prowler's sight. he pops up with his gun pointed at the prowler's controller.}

<D>__{drop it.}
<A>__{the controller, scared shitless, drops the hand control. the prowler dies the plug pulled. eddie smiles at kates, and exits.}
