<A>__{derek puts the camera up to his eye. in slo mo – dreamlike sequence derek pans the camera around the kitchen and stops at assorted pictures of the family. derek focuses on a family shot of doris, derek, danny, davina, and dennis vinyard. tight on dennis. the handsome man smiles in a coat and tie. derek pans to a picture of a dirty and rugged dennis and a young davina, wearing her father’s fire helmet. derek pans the video camera. he stops on danny who’s now in the sink washing barbecue sauce off his hands and face. derek concentrates on the running water. the sink faucet becomes a powerful shower faucet crashing down. he turns off the camera and hands it back to seth.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{here. keep it.}
<A>__{a bewildered seth stares at him.}
<C>__{seth}
