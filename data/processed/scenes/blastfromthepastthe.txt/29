<A>__{with only the sound of wind, the jet continues to fall as the lights of the valley rush up to meet it.}

<P>__{(with arms spread)}
<D>__{home sweet home!}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{to you maybe.}
<A>__{calvin flicks a wall switch and we hear a series of lights coming on. the echoes of the sounds suggest a large, cavernous space. all we can see is the cinder block wall behind them and the hatch door, which calvin begins to shut by putting his body into it. just then there is a tremendous double explosion from above which knocks them to the floor. (note: helen hangs on to the roast, trying her best not to drop it.) the ladder, corrugated tube, roof, and lots or dirt and rock begin to crash down into the anteroom. calvin struggles to his feet and gets the vault door shut just in the nick of time.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what was that?!}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{are you all right?!}
<A>__{hanging on to the roast she nods vigorously, trying to be brave.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes, i think so.}
<A>__{calvin hurries to a bright red metal box on the wall. next to the box is a large thermometer or gauge that's labeled "radiation count." there are other gauges that are dropping to zero.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{oh, no! it's happened! look at that heat!! all my surface indicators are knocked out! oh, my lord...it's actually happened!!}
