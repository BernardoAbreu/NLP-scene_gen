<L>__{interior gideon's pawn shop night}
<A>__{close up of gideon's thick fingers shuffling grimy currency. some scratchy 1920's tune plays throughout b.g., like a broadcast from another time and place. tighter angle gideon looking up at a metallic sound, o.s. irritated.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{piss off, we're closed.}
<A>__{as the outside security gate rattles, gideon draws his magnum and approaches the front door.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{fucking creatures of the night; they never goddamn learn.}
<A>__{sudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate scree back against the frosted glass of the front door.}
<C>__{gideon }
<D>__{hey!!}
<A>__{and he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the door, gun up. before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes rocketing through the glass, pegging gideon in the forehead and knocking him flat on his ass. he loses the pistol. eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to disintegrate around him. he disclaims, thespian.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{"suddenly i heard a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door."}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you heard me rapping, right?}
<A>__{low angle gideon on the floor reacting to eric's weird appearance and looking for his gun.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{oh, bullshit! you're trespassing asshole, you're breakin' and enterin' and you just bought me a fucking door!}
<A>__{during gideon's rant, eric brushes glass cubes from his shoulders, nonplussed. now he flings gideon across the room. gideon crashes into the counter cage. as eric advances on him:}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i'm looking for something in an engagement ring. gold.}
<A>__{as eric comes up behind him, gideon reaches through the open cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{you're looking for a coroner,shit for brains!}
<A>__{and he tries to nail eric with the knife. new angle behind gideon as gideon swings no eric behind him. tilt to reveal eric hanging off the cage above gideon. eric slams the cage door against gideon's head. drops down like a spider and collects the knife.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i repeat: a gold engagement ring. it was pawned here, a year ago, by another gentleman whose name, i believe was... "t bird"?}
<B>__{in tight on eric and gideon}
<A>__{eric twists gideon's sail like shirt and gideon turns bright red.}
<C>__{eric }
<D>__{cute nickname, don't you think?}
<C>__{gideon}
<P>__{(gasping)}
<D>__{i ain't got no fuckin' ring.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{wrong answer.}
<A>__{eric nails gideon's hand to the counter top. gideon howls!}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{all's i got is in a box! behind the counter!}
<A>__{eric jumps through the cage door. gideon's eyes bug as he sees his own pierced hand, immobilized. angle on eric behind the counter scans the shelves. rows of boxed ammo. kerosene tins. a shotgun. knives and assorted knuckle duster curios. and the ring box. close up the ring box in eric's hand. dozens of gold rings. eric's fingers sift through them.}
<B>__{tighter on eric}
<A>__{he brings each ring to his face. intercut : with gideon's feeble struggles and invective, o.s.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{no... no... no... no...}
<A>__{he tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder. until: close up the ring in eric's hand obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light flash: shelly's face. a perfect vision...}
