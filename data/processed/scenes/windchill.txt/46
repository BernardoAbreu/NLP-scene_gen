<A>__{he looks over as the door wrenches open and she climbs in. she pulls the door shut behind her, then huddles against it. eyeing him warily. he starts to reach toward her and she brandishes the scissors }
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{relax.}
<A>__{ and switches off the overhead interior lights, explaining:}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{we need to conserve the battery.}
<A>__{with the interior light off the car fills with an otherwordly blue glow reflected off the snow. she pulls her knees up as if trying to make herself as small as she can, to position herself as far away from him as is humanly possible on a bench seat. her eyes cut to the dashboard clock. she frowns.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{that's not right. the clock...}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(checks watch)}
<D>__{huh? no, it's not. it should read...}
<A>__{he frowns, looking down at his watch. he holds it to his ear.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{my watch stopped. oh well... guess we'll just have to rely on my precisely calibrated body clock.}
<A>__{he tosses his useless watch over his shoulder into the back seat. suddenly she notices a trickle of blood coming from his head.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{you're bleeding.}
<A>__{he touches two fingers to the left side of his head. they come away bloody. as he lifts his watch cap we see the left side of his head is matted with frozen blood, now beginning to melt. the collar of his coat is soaked with it.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{it's nothing...}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{it doesn't look like nothing.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{scalp wounds bleed a lot. head wounds in general. that's why, if you're ever in a bar fight, the thing to do is pick up a bottle and smash the other guy across the bridge of his nose. it'll make his eyes fill with blood and snot, and buy you enough time to run away.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(softening, amused)}
<D>__{that's really useful, thanks.}
<A>__{a tense silence fills the car. he closes his eyes and leans his head back, as if trying to catch a few z's.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{so where are you from, really?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(eyes closed)}
<D>__{place called glens falls...}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{that's not in delaware.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{that's, like, in the complete opposite direction!}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{that's like twenty minutes from school!}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{all right, all right, so i lied... obviously.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{eyes still closed, he answers in a flat uninflected voice.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i just thought you seemed cool. i don't have a line or a `game' or whatever the hell it's called. so when i saw a chance to get you alone for six uninterrupted hours, i took it.}
<A>__{she ponders this for a beat, one piece still not clicking.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{but how did you know where i lived?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{asked around.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{which explains how you found out i was from delaware... but not how you knew i needed a ride home. i mean, i always fly. how could you possibly know that for, like the}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{first time in my college career, i was planning on going greyhound }
<A>__{just then her eyes go wide, as it suddenly dawns on her.}
