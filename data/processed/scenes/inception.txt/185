<A>__{cobb looks across at ariadne.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{psychiatrists judged her sane?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{she was sane. she was just lost in the labyrinth.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{then why should you blame yourself?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{because we were a family. and we had a life i would do anything to get back to now. but that reality wasn't enough for me then.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{it might have been your idea to push the limits, cobb. but you're not responsible for the idea that destroyed her. the idea that her world wasn't real... that was her own idea from her own mind.}
<A>__{cobb says nothing.}
<C>__{ariadne }
<D>__{your guilt defines her. powers her. if we're going to succeed in this, you're going to have to forgive yourself, and you're going to have to confront her. but you don't have to do it alone.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you don't have to do this for me }
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{i'm doing it for the others. they don't know the risk they've taken coming in here with you.}
<A>__{cobb looks at the rooftop opposite, sees a sniper take up a position. cobb shakes his head, frustrated.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{we can't stay here. arthur?!}
