<P>__{(over joyed)}
<D>__{really? that's awesome, man. that means a lot to me, `cause, like, plenty of dudes come in to buy and pretend to be all buddy buddy with me, but in my head i'm always, like, "you don't like me, you like my drugs, so fuck you, buddy!" you know? and just so you know, i totally could have lit that cross joint on my own. i'd just have to use candles, but, like, i've never smoked one of those with anyone before.}
<A>__{dale passes saul the jointerior}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{so, do you think we should leave town? we could just get on a bus and go, right?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{we only have, like, fifty bucks. i don't think that could even pay for one ticket.}
<A>__{saul rubs the roach out in the dirt.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{what about your sack?}
<A>__{saul rubs his balls again.}
<C>__{saul}

<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no way, man. i'm not going to sell to kids.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{why? they're gonna get it from somewhere. i mean, we got it from guys like us.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{well, then not kids at that school.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{well, there's a bunch of private ones nearby, but they're into way crazier shit than weed }
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i can't do it, man. i'm not going to a high school is there anywhere else we could go?}
<C>__{saul}
