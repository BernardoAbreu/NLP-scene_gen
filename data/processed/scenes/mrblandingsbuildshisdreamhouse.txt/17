<L>__{interior the bathroom}
<A>__{very small with a stall shower. jim takes off his bathrobe, yawns, gets on the scale, looks at the dial, shakes his head. he takes a deep breath, draws in his stomach, looks down, scowls, shrugs, gets off, moves to the mirror. he examines the thinness of his hair, the condition of his tongue, etc. taking his toothbrush he looks down at the tube he is about to use, frowns. what he sees the toothpaste tube what he sees the toothpaste tube. it has been squeezed in the middle, one of blandings' pet peeves. close shot jim meticulously smoothes out the tube close shot jim meticulously smoothes out the tube, rolls up the used portion from the bottom. then placing a small amount on his brush, he caps the tube, and starts vigorously to brush his teeth. as he does so, he attempts with his free hand, to put the tube back in the medicine cabinet which he opens. close shot the medicine cabinet close shot the medicine cabinet, loaded to the hilt with medical accumulation of fourteen years of family life. close shot jim close shot jim. as he pushes the tube into the bulging top shelf, a bottle of iodine falls out. jim makes a desperate one handed catch, still brushing his teeth. as he pushes the iodine into the second shelf, a small bottle of pills pops out. jim catches it, pushes it back into the cabinet. a bottle of cough medicine falls out. he catches it, tries to put it back, finds it won't fit. he looks at the bottle, sniffs it, contemplates its value, throws it in the wastebasket. he finishes washing his mouth, admires his teeth, disrobes and steps into the shower, putting on his shower cap. he reacts, scowls, takes off the cap and turns it upside down, a full cup of water falling out. he reaches out for a towel, dries the inside of the cap, carefully puts it back on his now wet hair. then he turns the water on and at the first warm spray jim blandings' life takes a sharp turn for the better. he starts to sing, a robust bathroom baritone version of "home on the range."}
