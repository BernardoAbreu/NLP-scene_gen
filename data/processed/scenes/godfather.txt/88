<L>__{int nite: hospital lobby (winter 1945)}
<A>__{michael stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital lobby. he looks to the right; there is a long, empty corridor. to the left: the same. high full angle, as michael walks through the desolated building lit by eerie green neon lighting. all we hear are his sole footsteps. he walks up to a desk marked "information". no one is there. he moves quickly to a door marked "office"; swings into it; no one is there. he looks onto the desk: there is half a sandwich, and a half filled bottle of coke.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hello? hello?}
<A>__{now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly, alertly. michael walking down the hospital corridors; all alone. the floors have just been mopped. they are still wet.}
