<L>__{exterior deck day}
<A>__{under sail. skipper stands at the wheel overseeing the crew taking exams. each writes furiously as alice scribbles problems on the blackboard which hangs from the chart house door. as the boys scratch out the problems, john seems paralyzed. he looks over at phil and copies down his answer. he checks crib notes hidden in his shorts. chuck and robin both see this and exchange looks.}
<L>__{interior aft cabin day}
<A>__{john makes his way down the narrow corridor towards the head. robin follows. chuck drops down the aft companionway, intercepting john.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{where you going?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{to take a piss.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{john turns around, surprised, sandwiched.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah, that's right. you wanna come in and shake it for me?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{if you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you've gotta be kidding. get the fuck outta my way!}
<A>__{chuck throws open the engine room door and they shove john inside.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what the hell!!!}
<A>__{chuck manages to pin john. robin checks his pockets and comes up with the crib notes. chuck lets go. john snatches them, ashamed.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{takin' a piss?}
<A>__{john turns away.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{why, man?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't have to listen to this.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{yes you do, stupid. because if you don't, i'm gonna go right up there and have a heart to heart with skipper and you'll be on the first plane back to idiotville.}
<A>__{john lunges at chuck, sending them both sprawling. robin leaps on top of john.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{cut it out man!! stop it!!! what's the matter with you? if phil had caught you he'd have ratted you out in a second. you get caught cheating, you'll get kicked off the boat.}
<A>__{john explodes, tears flowing.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i cheated to get on the boat!!! all right?!}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{he lets go of chuck and stands up trying to hide his emotions.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i doctored my grades so i'd make the cut. i'm a moron, okay? you satisfied?!}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you're not a moron.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{wanna bet? takes me half a day to get through one chapter of lawford and i still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about. you know why it takes me so long to write papers? because i can't spell. while everybody else is sleeping, i'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.}
<A>__{john chokes back a sob.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hell, they even kicked me outa vo tech 'cause i couldn't read a slide rule.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{i can show you how to use a slide rule.}
<A>__{the three turn around, startled.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{how long you been standing there?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{long enough.}
<A>__{john looks down, resigned.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{they were gonna put me into special ed this year. i stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. shit, who am i kidding. i will never pass the boards.}
<C>__{chuck}
