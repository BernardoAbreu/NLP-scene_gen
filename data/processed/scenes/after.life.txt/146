<A>__{anna stares vacantly at the ceiling. eliot places a bunch of tulips on the trolley. turns on a cd. classical music fills the room as before. he moves over to anna. gently pulls away the sheet.}

<D>__{yes. the tulips love the sun.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i miss the sun.}
<A>__{anna glances up at the shuttered window. eliot snaps on his latex gloves. picks up a sponge and wets it in the bowl of water. anna turns to the tulips.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{are they your favorite flower?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{tulips? yes. i think so.}
<A>__{eliot raises anna's arm. delicately washes her armpit. along the length of her arm. her skin pale.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i thought it'd be lilies. white lilies. don't they symbolize death?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{no. they symbolize purity.}
<A>__{he moves to her breasts, following the contours of her body. pausing every now and then to rinse the sponge.}
