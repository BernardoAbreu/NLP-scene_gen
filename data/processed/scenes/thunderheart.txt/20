<L>__{exterior buffalo butte bar night}
<A>__{the indian man, is pushed into a stumble, and caught by another white man as a little game of catch takes place. cooch, stepping into the circle, shirt half unbuttoned, hair a mess, looks on. then steps in front of a big local and catches the indian as he comes stumbling. he holds onto him, looking at the faces that turn his way. ray steps up beside him, looking tense.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{what's goin' on here?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i can't walk across the goddamn street without some breed ass fallin' all over me?}
<A>__{and then cooch shoves the indian with all his might back across the road. the locals resume their fun, and cooch looks at a local man and shares a chattering laugh that makes ray do a serious take.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{watch out now, he wants a kiss, ray, wants a kiss }
<A>__{the indian ends up stumbling back toward ray, and ray catches him this time. the man maintains a perfect vacant expression and keeps acting as though nothing of the sort is happening. but he is dizzy, and exhausted, and ray keeps him from falling. cooch looks at ray. their eyes meet. ray shoves the man forward. this time, instead of catching him, the local on the receiving end, hauls off and punches him in the face. the indian drops. cooch runs in, grabs the indian under the arms and drags him back to his car.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{go ahead, skin, get your ass back on your sacred land. get outta here.}
<A>__{he shoves him behind the wheel as the locals crowd around. they don't see cooch throw the wheel stick in drive, and lean into the man's ear.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{get outta here. drive.}
<A>__{cooch slams the door, and kicks it, and the vehicle lurches forward. a beer can clanks off the rear window, and rolls clanking into the middle of the road. ray stands there with the locals as they all watch the car drive off across the reservation line. cooch, belly sticking out of his unbuttoned shirt, and a breathless smile on his face, heads to the bar without breaking stride. this man has done "underground" before.}
