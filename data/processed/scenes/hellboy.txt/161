<L>__{interior b.p.r.d. main hall area day}
<A>__{a new space. office corridors radiate out from a brass b.p.r.d. logo on the floor. a few agents monitor computer stations and tactical glass boards. liz and myers walk in, carrying her suitcases. she looks around and sees broom coming down the hall.}
<C>__{broom}
<D>__{welcome back.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{it's only for the weekend, professor broom. then i will be on my way }

<P>__{(impeccable courtesy)}
<D>__{come and go as you please.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{find your way back. we've made quite a few changes }
<A>__{crash!!! liz screams and myers draws his gun. smashing through a glass partition, the mangled steel locker lands in the middle of the hall in a rain of glass and aluminum studs. next, manning appears, retreating but unharmed.}
<C>__{manning}
<P>__{(gasping)}
<D>__{i want that thing locked up, starting now now!!! you hear me??!!}
<A>__{he flees.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(to broom)}
<D>__{nothing's changed. home, sweet home.}
<A>__{mortified, broom hurries after manning. hellboy calmly steps through the hole in the wall.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<P>__{(seeing her)}
<D>__{liz? liz!!}
<A>__{she spins on her heel and walks off. hellboy turns to myers.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{you!!! you did it, buddy }
<A>__{myers holsters his gun and follows liz. hellboy is all alone now.}
<C>__{hellboy}
