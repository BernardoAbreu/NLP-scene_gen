<A>__{ted, nervous, anxious with five or six printouts in his hand has norman's ear in front of the sink...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{he's manic, norman. you know that? this reliance on harry is misplaced. you hear me? totally misplaced. he's overlooking things. obvious things.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{like what?}
<A>__{ted hands him a printout...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you mean a picture?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{take a look. i rearranged the numbers. put 'em up to the light.}
<P>__{(norman does)}
<D>__{go ahead. squint at it.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i don't see anything.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{squint harder.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{please, ted.}

<C>__{norman}
<D>__{this is like nursery school.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{don't you see it? it's a picture of the creature.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{the creature?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{inside the sphere. look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms. there's no head, so i'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?}
<A>__{on norman ted's lost it.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{well, how about we wait and see what harry comes up with?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{sure, why not. give him the trophy. that pretentious son of a bitch. you heard him, norman. all that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit. and "impotent". where does he get off saying i'm impotent? he's a fucking self righteous, little prick.}
