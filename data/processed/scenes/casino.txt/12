<L>__{interior tangiers floor soft count room day}
<A>__{camera follows john nance carrying a small suitcase and walking through the casino to a door leading to the cashier's cage. the sign on the door reads 'authorized personnel only'. he walks through the cage, to another door: 'notice keep out'.}
<C>__{ace }
<D>__{we're the only winners. the players don't stand a chance. and their cash flows from the tables to our boxes ...through the cage and into the most sacred room in the casino ...the place where they add up all the money ...the holy of holies ...the count room.}
<A>__{he opens the door. we see inside the count room from nance's point of view. it looks like the area behind a teller's cage in a bank. a large room, windowless, decor free. one side is a mesh cage, opened to reveal stacks of cash boxes. several counters in white shirts are gathered around a glass table counting and sorting paper money.)}
<C>__{ace }
<D>__{now this place was off limits. counter #1 verify two thousand.}
<C>__{ace }
<D>__{even i couldn't get inside, but it was my job to keep it filled with cash. that's for sure.}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{they had so much fuckin' money in there, you could build a house out of stacks of $100 bills. and the best part was that upstairs, the board of directors didn't know what the fuck was going on.}
<A>__{at one end of the room the clerks empty the metal boxes and rapidly count the cash at a counting table. the camera follows a cash 'drop box' being lifted from the stack by a clerk. he pours the cash on to the table and shows the empty box to a video camera. counter #2 rapidly counts the cash and announces:}
<D>__{counter #2 five thousand.}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{i mean, to them everything looked on the up and up. right? wrong.}
<A>__{the first counter recounts the cash.}
<D>__{counter #1 verify five thousand.}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{the guys inside the counting room...}
<A>__{stacks of bills lie nearby. the camera pans across the room to another table manned by a count room executive who repeats the figure and writes it down on a master list.}
<C>__{count room exec}
<D>__{five thousand.}
<A>__{we move back to nance opening a cabinet full of stacks of $100 bills. he opens his suitcase and begins to fill it with cash. as he does this, the workers studiously look in other directions.}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{...were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry. they'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips. they'd even take cash right out of the drop boxes. and it was up to this guy right here [nance], standin' in front of about two million dollars, to skim the cash off the top without anybody gettin' wise ...the irs or anybody. counter #1 verify two hundred.}
<A>__{nance closes the case and walks out. one of the counters dumps another container of money on the table.}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{now, notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything. somehow, somebody's always lookin' the other way. now, look at these guys [counters]. they look busy, right? they're countin' money. who wants to bother them? i mean, god forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal. meanwhile, you're in and you're out.}
<A>__{nance exits the count room and proceeds through the lobby of the casino, passing ace and sherbert, to a side exit door.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{past the jag off guard who gets an extra c note a week just to watch the door. i mean, it's routine. business as usual: in, out, hello, goodbye. and that's all there is to it. just another fat fuck walkin' out of the casino with a suitcase. now, that suitcase was goin' straight to one place: right to kansas city ...which was as close to las vegas as the midwest bosses could go without gettin' themselves arrested.}
<A>__{nance leaves the casino and gets into a cab parked at the curb.}
