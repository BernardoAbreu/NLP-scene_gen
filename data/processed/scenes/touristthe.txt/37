<L>__{interior demidov's hotel room day}
<A>__{demidov sips a glass of red wine. the view from his room rivals the one at the danieli but demidov pays no attention. he's busy scanning his emails on his blackberry. knock, knock. a thick necked bodyguard in the background goes to answer the door. a moment later... he ushers in quinn, the swiss interpol agent.}
<C>__{demidov}
<D>__{take a seat, mr. quinn. can i offer you a glass of brunello? it's a '97...}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{no thank you, mr. demidov.}
<A>__{demidov swirls his glass.}
<C>__{demidov}
<D>__{you know i'd never admit this at home, but vodka is for peasants. there's much we could learn from the italians.}
<A>__{he smiles pleasantly at quinn, then, on a dime, he turns back to business.}
<C>__{demidov }
<D>__{tell me i'm not going to be disappointed.}
<A>__{quinn takes out an envelope and passes it over.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{he flips it open and examines the contents. we glimpse a photo of cara and some texterior}
<C>__{demidov}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{he always had good taste...}
<A>__{demidov makes a gesture and a second bodyguard with a scar on his face gives quinn an envelope filled with cash. quinn tucks it away discreetly, as if embarrassed by the directness of the pay off.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{mr. demidov... if i may ask you a question... why do you care so much about alexander pearce? i mean, you've come here yourself... as if it were personal.}
<A>__{demidov looks at quinn thoughtfully.}
<C>__{demidov}
<D>__{it may be difficult for you to understand, mr. quinn; you swiss are mercenary by nature. but for some of us, there are things more important than money. i put my trust in alexander pearce. he betrayed that trust.}
<A>__{quinn smiles tightly. he's ready to get out of there.}
<C>__{demidov }
<D>__{and it's bad business to let somebody make a fool of you. if pearce gets away with it, what does that say about me?}
