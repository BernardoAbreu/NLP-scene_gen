<A>__{prew stops on the threshold, stares at the room in happy amazement. it is large, smartly furnished. in the rear, glass doors lead to a porch. one of the panelled walls is filled with bookshelves, floor to ceiling. the bookshelves are filled with books. a hearty feminine voice calls "hi!" from the kitchen, and as prew and alma come into the room, gorgette enters from the kitchen. she is a very tall, very gay, good looking girl.}
