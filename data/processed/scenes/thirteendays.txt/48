<L>__{exterior the rose garden day}
<A>__{kenny and bobby follow the president down a path through the rose garden. the shock of the morning has worn off. the president stops, looks at them.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{i don't think it's going to matter what khruschev's intentions are. i tell you, right now... i don't see any way around hitting them.}
<A>__{a long moment of silence as they move along again.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{if we hit 'em, kill a lot of russians, they'll move against berlin. they attack berlin, that's nato... and we're at war.}
<A>__{the guys stop again. the autumn day is bright, warm, alive. the air, the distant city sounds derail the relentless train of logic for a beat. and in their faces we see that all three men, for the first time, feel the enormity of war, its shadow over everything. it's only a couple of steps away. steps that they're seriously contemplating.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{damned if we do, but if we don't, we're in a war for sure somewhere else in six months.}
<A>__{pained, the president turns away.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{no choice. this is going to cost lives any way we go. do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. we have to get rid of those missiles.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{there've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{he's right, jack. taylor is saying we may have some time. we've got to use it.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{so if there are alternatives that make sense and i'm not saying there are we need 'em. need 'em fast.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what about the allies? congress? i think we may need to start letting key people know. and they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. we're going to need to get the u.n. staff in and warmed up. jesus... i don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the soviets got that cryptographer of ours.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{we can't worry about everything right now. we've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{the other thing is...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{... i know. cia and the military fucked us on the bay of pigs.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{they're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. we can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. we need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{we got a bunch of smart guys. we lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.}
<A>__{kenny and the president look at him. bobby nods.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{i will do it.}
<C>__{kenny}
<P>__{(to the president)}
<D>__{it's too politicized with you in there, anyway. they need to be able to stick their necks out.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{it'll be the principals, a couple of the key guys from each department: the executive committee of the national security council. we'll call it excom.}
<A>__{kenny snorts a laugh. bobby shoots him a cross look.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{excom. has a ring to it. like f troop.}
<A>__{the president stops. bobby and kenny stop, too.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{okay. kenny and i only show for the meetings you call us into. impress us. and do it fast.}
<P>__{(to kenny)}
<D>__{you're in charge of keeping this quiet. if word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. and it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{then we need to do a few things right away. no pierre. he knows, the press knows. you're going to have to keep up your schedule your movements are followed too closely. and we need to get these guys out of the white house. george ball's got a conference room at state.}
<P>__{(to bobby)}
<D>__{reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.}
<A>__{bobby nods.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i think we should bring in dean acheson. he was fighting soviets while we were still working the wards in boston.}
<A>__{the president nods his approval. looks at kenny.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{find him, kenny. we're going to need all the help we can get.}
