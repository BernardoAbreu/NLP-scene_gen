<A>__{david stands frozen in the train station. his face is almost unreadable. david is standing less than a foot away from the man he bumped. they're standing shoulder to shoulder. david's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and then finally onto the man. he's huge. at least three inches taller than david. his shoulders are massive. he's wearing a one piece orange uniform. the man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the full trash bag within it. he replaces it with a fresh one. he throws the full trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it. david watches the man head across the floor towards a double door marked "station maintenance staff only". four identical gray bins sit outside the door. the huge man disappears with his bin inside. david waits. he just stares hard at the double doors. nothing happens for the longest time... no one comes out. david makes a decision. he starts towards the doors. and then they open. the huge glassy eyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder. he's wearing a baseball hat with his uniform now. he heads toward a back exit. david lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him.}
