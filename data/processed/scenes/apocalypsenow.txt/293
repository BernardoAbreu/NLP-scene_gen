<A>__{through wires and claymore glass, each wilder and more extreme. they burn in the pools of luminescent napalm but press relentlessly on. shell bursts overhead. they chant to themselves as they advance. nva have reached the walls and throw down scaling ladders and start up. suddenly the sky is bright with flares which produce weird psychedelic light. blared out at tremendous vol ume over and above the din of battle is light my fire.}
