<A>__{our first sight of this incredible ship is absolutely breathtaking. shinzon's vessel combines the clean lines of the traditional romulan warbird with unique weaponry and styling. it is huge, easily twice as large as the enterprise. and it is aggressive. awesome in its power.}

<A>__{and the image on the viewscreen transforms to: shinzon's viceroy. he stands on the scimitar's bridge. the bridge is as unique as the rest of shinzon's ship. instead of the usual mechanical clutter, this bridge is designed with an almost asian simplicity. like the rest of reman design, it is spare and elegant. since the remans are more comfortable in the darkness, most of the light comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core relays which dramatically soar up through the floor of the bridge. the crew gazes at the bridge and the monstrous features of the viceroy.}
