<A>__{headlights appear in the distance on a long, dusty stretch of road. growing as they approach, then coming to a stop in a cloud of dust as they move into f.g. where a line of fenceposts, barbwire blocks their path. as the car brakes, the passenger door opens and scully exits. a hot texas wind blows. a dog is barking somewhere. scully walks into the headlight wash, looking at a sign on the fence. after a moment, the driver's door opens and mulder exits.}

<D>__{this is great. this is fitting.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i've got to be in washington d.c. in eleven hours for a hearing the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{we're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence }
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{ of what exactly?!}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{that bomb in dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{they haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{yeah, well they may this one.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{what do you mean by haul?}

<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{been where?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where i am right now: at another dead end }

<A>__{sitting all by its lonely self. no swinging arms or gate. just one little sign between mulder and scully and their car. camera panning to the light of a locomotive speeding toward us.}
