<A>__{under a dim glowglobe, the duke is writing a note on a scroll like piece of paper. finishing reading, the duke seals the message in a cylinder and presses his signet ring, with a red hawk symbol of house of atreides, into a hole, which seals the cylinder with a swift hissing. he pauses, studying the metal tube. with a voice command, he extinguishes the glowglobe above him. he leans back in his chair as lightning flashes outside the window.}
