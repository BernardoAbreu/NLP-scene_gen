<L>__{interior convention hall houston night}
<A>__{the enormous arena is empty but for some maintenance workers and janitors. louis enters and makes his way to the stage. he approaches dead center and stands behind the podium looking out. gripping the podium hard he rocks it back and forth. taking no chances, he pulls a hammer out from the rear of his waistband and a bunch of nails from his coat pocket. looking around to see if anyone is paying any attention to him he quickly ducks down behind the podium. the sound of hammering fills the hall as louis, on his knees, nails the podium to the floor.}
