<ACTION>__{SKY. Over which a title "LONDON--SUMMER 1593" appears. Title card: In the glory days of the Elizabethan theatre two playhouses were fighting it out for writers and audiences. North of the city was the Curtain Theatre, home to England's most famous actor, Richard Burbage. Across the river was the competition, built by Philip Henslowe, a business with a cash flow problem... ...The Rose... Gradually a building is revealed, The Rose Theatre, three- tiered, open to the elements and empty. On the floor, roughly printed, a poster--torn, soiled, out of date. It says: SEPT. 7TH & 8TH AT NOON MR. EDWARD ALLEYN AND THE ADMIRAL'S MEN AT THE ROSE THEATRE, BANKSIDE THE LAMENTABLE TRAGEDIE OF THE MONEYLENDER REVENG'D OVER THIS the screams of a man under torture.
