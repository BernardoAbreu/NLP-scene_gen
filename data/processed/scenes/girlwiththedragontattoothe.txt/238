<A>__{finished with her candy bar and coffee, salander opens the 1967 files, looks through the clippings for anything of note in uppsala, where lena was killed. she finds no news of factories opening there that year, but she does come across a pr newsletter about a winter retreat for fifty employees and their families. there's a photo of henrik presenting someone with a best worker of the year plaque. and another taken at a dinner for twenty guests and vanger family members: the camera has captured henrik presiding at the head of the table, putting on a brave face, raising a champagne flute as everyone else does the same except for the young man at the far right foreground. he looks sullen. but what teenager wouldn't at an event as boring as this. salander would look even more sullen. she checks the caption and reads: ... far right, martin vanger (19), currently studying in uppsala. uppsala. same place as lena though it's what young martin is wearing that strikes her: an uppsala private school blazer with a lion on its pocket the same as on lena andersson's sweater in the photo of her in the article about her murder.}
