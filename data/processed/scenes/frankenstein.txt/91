<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{woods dusk tilt down to reveal a solitary figure in a greatcoat trudging across the sodden countryside under a dismal, darkening sky. cold. hungry. wet. tired. the creature pauses, hearing faint music drifting on the breeze: the lovely flute like sounds of a recorder. he slogs to the crest of a ridge. there's a small house in the valley below. a peasant dwelling. smoke drifts from the chimney. that's where the music comes from (a simple and plaintive rendition of our movie's waltz love theme). the creature proceeds down the ridge... drawn by the music and the promise of warmth. house day the creature approaches cautiously. furtive. he eases to a window, catches a glimpse inside, draws back. listening. the tune ends. we hear the pleasant murmur of voices. footsteps come clumping across the floor. the creature reels back and dives around the side of the house as the door unlatches and swings open. felix exits, a poor man trying to scratch an honest living from the soil. he heads in the same direction as the creature...}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{...and walks around the corner of the house just as the creature scrambles from view behind the chicken coops. the creature watches through the wire and wood as felix approaches and stops, only his legs visible. feed is scattered through the wire. the chickens begins to eat. the creature backs up pigsty dusk ...and finds himself in the company of pigs. the animals grunt and squeal in alarm.}
<C>__{felix }
<D>__{yes, yes, i'm coming...}
<A>__{the creature scurries further back into the shadows as felix's feet stop just outside. a pail is upended. slop pours into the trough. felix walks away. the pigs scurry to eat. the creature leans forward intently. food? he crawls to the trough and squeezes in among the pigs. they jostle, but he jostles right back, wanting his fair share. he laps up the slop with his fingers, dribbling it down his chin. not much on taste, but it's edible. he stops, hearing the recorder music again, turning toward the sound. he follows it, crawling back into the darkest recesses where the sty adjoins the wall of the house. he places his eye to a chink between the logs... ...and sees grandfather playing the instrument near a fireplace of glowing embers. the creature shifts for another view, sees the family preparing the table for dinner. felix and his wife marie are helped by their children, maggie and thomas, ages 6 and 8}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{bring grandfather to the table.}
<A>__{the old man stops playing as the children scurry over. as maggie helps him to his feet, thomas tosses another log on the fire. it blazes up. fire and sparks. in the pigsty, the creature draws back with a fearful moan... ...that nobody but grandfather hears, he pauses to gaze blindly toward the wall, eyes milky with cataracts, wondering what it might have been. probably nothing. he lets the children lead him toward the table. the meal is brought from the stove and ladled out. the creature eases back to the chink in the wall, smelling it from here. a string of drool spills from his mouth. it's humble fare, not very appetizing, but it looks like a feast compared to pig slop...}
