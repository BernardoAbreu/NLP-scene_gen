<B>__{music bed}
<A>__{this room is creepy. it is full of loud pumps and large pipes. robbie is making his way through a labyrinth of piping and gauges and the like. he peers and sees a head with a red scarf, but it moves out of view. surf music fades. there is a constant whine of the pumps. robbie moves further in and finally comes across a man holding a large pipewrench, with his back to him. he is working to tame a small leak.}
