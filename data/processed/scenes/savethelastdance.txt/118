<L>__{interior free clinic (south baltimore) day}
<A>__{the lowest common denominator for misery. the room is filled with young women, most them black, and children of all ages. they are piled up like cars on a freeway, waiting to be seen. the noise level is at a peak when chenille and sara walk in. chenille's carrying a fussy christopher, his diaper bag and her backpack. sara, wanting to be helpful, reaches for christopher.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{want me to take him?}
<A>__{chenille shakes her head. walks to reception to sign herself in. sara takes in the faces of girls younger than herself, the grime and gloom of the room. it's incomprehensible that this is a place where sick children are brought to get well. chenille finishes at the desk. returns to sara. they cross to a corner of the clinic where they sit on the floor. chenille indicates the receptionist bitterly.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{that wench. you gotta stand over her to make sure she puts your name on the damn list. triflin' bitch.}
<A>__{chenille starts to change christopher's diaper. he starts to wail and flail. chenille can't placate him. one of his kicks connects with chenille's open backpack, sends books and papers flying. sara can see the veins stand up on chenille's neck.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i will get 'em.}
<A>__{she does. chenille's finally got control of christopher but he's still crying. chenille slips off his dirty diaper. when sara hands her a clean one, chenille regards her strangely, as if just remembering that she's there.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{so your old man flipped about the fight.}
<P>__{(with some animus)}
<D>__{probably thinks it's all patrick's fault.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{no. i explained about nikki.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{right. you put it all on her. none of it's on you.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{she started it, chenille. she wanted to start it. i told you what she said.}
<A>__{chenille flashes a look, finishes up with christopher. she picks him up, puts a bottle in his mouth. cradles him.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{maybe she didn't have no business gettin' in your face. but she had a reason to say what she said.}
<A>__{a reason? sara studies her, trying to fathom the remark.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{so you agree with her? you think i don't belong with patrick.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{what i think don't matter. but you and him act like it don't bother people that you're together. like it don't hurt people to see.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(her irish up)}
<D>__{we like each other. what is the big fucking deal? it's him and me. not us and other 'people.'}
<A>__{the white girl with the rose colored reasoning. chenille glares at sara, her voice designed to snatch the blinders off.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{black people, sara. black women.}
<P>__{(passionately)}
<D>__{patrick's about somethin'. he's smart. he's motivated. he's for real. he ain't gonna make no babies and not take care of 'em or run the streets, fuck up his life. he's gonna do somethin' with himself. here you come, white and right, and you take one of the few decent men left after jail, drugs and drive bys. that's what nikki meant about you up in our world.}
<A>__{sara sits there, stupefied. understanding. not understanding.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{there's only one world, chenille.}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{i thought we were friends. guess i was wrong.}
<A>__{she gets up, walks out. something in chenille wants to call after her, but she's too miserable, too torn up inside to do it.}
