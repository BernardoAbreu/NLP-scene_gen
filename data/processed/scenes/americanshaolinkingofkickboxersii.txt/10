<D>__{you only lose if you give up.}
<A>__{angle on trevor's corner the psychologist is exhorting him to destroy drew. trevor leans back on his padded stool, smiling. the 3rd round starts. in this round, trevor is destroying drew, making him look ridiculous. a clinch comes, and (insert here) before they can break, trevor grabs the drawstring around drew's waist and pulls. they face off ("20 seconds" comes the call), and trevor charges. as drew blocks, his pants begin to sag. trevor, not trying to score, just trying to keep drew's hands busy, keeps coming. drew's pants drop lower and lower. when they get around his knees, he finally notices them, and reaches down to get them. trevor drives and picks him up in a throw, effectively showing drew's bare ass to the world.}
