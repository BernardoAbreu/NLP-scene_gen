<L>__{exterior the piers night}
<A>__{lights glisten across the hudson river distant orbs reflected in a thousand shimmering faux stars in weak defiance against the night sky. a sodium vapor glow veils everything in generous haloes, making the night more beautiful than it really is. dancing silhouettes, laughing, playing, yelling, flying, always dancing silhouettes punctuate the summer breeze with clapping set to the rhythm of soulful house. like puck on a midsummer's night, like peter pan and his lost boys. among the silhouettes is laura, enthroned atop a railing. laura, smoking a joint grandly, surrounded by an adoring circle, a sycophantic harem of four. laura, completely miserable as she watches two other silhouettes drawing closer, spinning, collapsing, now righting, always connected. alike and bina. bina smiles and snakes her arms around alike's neck. alike too shy to react, giggles and folds. laura watches the pair spin and passes to the left before stalking off toward the connected shadows.}
