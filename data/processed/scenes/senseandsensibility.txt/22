<L>__{interior norland park staircase day}
<A>__{fanny is walking with edward, who looks at the pictures with interest.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{they are all exceedingly spoilt, i find. miss margaret spends all her time up trees and under furniture and i have barely had a civil word from marianne.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{my dear fanny, they have just lost their father their lives will never be the same again.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{that is no excuse.}
<L>__{interior norland park library day}
<A>__{fanny leads edward in. she sniffs with distaste.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{i have never liked the smell of books.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{oh? no. the dust, perhaps.}
<A>__{as they speak, edward notices a large atlas retreating apparently all by itself across the floor. someone is obviously under the table, pulling it out of sight. he registers it and immediately moves in such a way as to shield it from fanny. he turns back, searching for something to divert her.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i hear you have great plans for the walnut grove.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{oh yes! i shall have it pulled down to make room for a grecian temple.}
<A>__{there is a stifled wail from under the table, which edward covers with a cough.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{how picturesque. will you show me the site?}
<A>__{and he ushers fanny out, flicking a quick glance over his shoulder at the fugitive's foot.}
