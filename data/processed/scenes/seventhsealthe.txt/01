<A>__{the knight is no longer alone. death has come to him and he raises his hand.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{shall we play our game to the end?}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{your move!}
<A>__{death raises his hand and strikes the knight's queen. antonius block looks at}
<B>__{death.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{now i take your queen.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{i didn't notice that.}
<A>__{the knight leans over the game. the moonlight moves over the chess pieces, which seem to have a life of their own. jof has dozed off for a few moments, but suddenly he wakens. then he sees the knight and death together. he becomes very frightened and awakens mia.}
<C>__{jof}
<D>__{mia!}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{yes, what is it?}
<C>__{jof}
<D>__{i see something terrible. something i almost can't talk about.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{what do you see?}
<C>__{jof}
<D>__{the knight is sitting over there playing chess.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{yes, i can see that too and i don't think it's so terrible.}
<C>__{jof}
<D>__{but do you see who he's playing with?}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{he is alone. you mustn't frighten me this way.}
<C>__{jof}
<D>__{no, no, he isn't alone.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{who is it, then?}
<C>__{jof}
<D>__{death. he is sitting there playing chess with death himself.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{you mustn't say that.}
<C>__{jof}
<D>__{we must try to escape.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{one can't do that.}
<C>__{jof}
<D>__{we must try. they are so occupied with their game that if we move very quietly, they won't notice us.}
<A>__{jof gets up carefully and disappears into the darkness behind the trees. mia remains standing, as if paralyzed by fear. she stares fixedly at the knight and the chess game. she holds her son in her arms. now jof returns.}
<C>__{jof}
<D>__{i have harnessed the horse. the wagon is standing near the big tree. you go first and i will follow you with the packs. see that mikael doesn't wake up.}
<A>__{mia does what jof has told her. at the same moment, the knight looks up from his game.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{it is your move, antonius block.}
<A>__{the knight remains silent. he sees mia go through the moonlight towards the wagon. jof bends down to pick up the pack and follows at a distance.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{have you lost interest in our game?}
<A>__{the knight's eyes become alarmed. death looks at him intently.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{lost interest? on the contrary.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{you seem anxious. are you hiding anything?}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{nothing escapes you or does it?}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{nothing escapes me. no one escapes from me.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{it's true that i'm worried.}
<A>__{he pretends to be clumsy and knocks the chess pieces over with the hem of his coat. he looks up at death.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{i've forgotten how the pieces stood.}
<C>__{death}
<P>__{(laughs contentedly)}
<D>__{but i have not forgotten. you can't get away that easily.}
<A>__{death leans over the board and rearranges the pieces. the knight looks past him towards the road. mia has just climbed up on the wagon. jof takes the horse by the bridle and leads it down the road. death notices nothing; he is completely occupied with reconstructing the game.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{now i see something interesting.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{what do you see?}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{you are mated on the next move, antonius block.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{that's true.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{did you enjoy your reprieve?}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{yes, i did.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{i'm happy to hear that. now i will be leaving you. when we meet again, you and your companions' time will be up.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{and you will divulge your secrets.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{i have no secrets.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{so you know nothing.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{i have nothing to tell.}
<A>__{the knight wants to answer, but death is already gone. a murmur is heard in the tree tops. dawn comes, a flickering light without life, making the forest seem threatening and evil. jof drives over the twisting road. mia sits beside him.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{what a strange light.}
<C>__{jof}
<D>__{i guess it's the thunderstorm which comes with dawn.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{no, it's something else. something terrible. do you hear the roar in the forest?}
<C>__{jof}
<D>__{it's probably rain.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{no, it isn't rain. he has seen us and he's following us. he has overtaken us; he's coming towards us.}
<C>__{jof}
<D>__{not yet, mia. in any case, not yet.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{i'm so afraid. i'm so afraid.}
<A>__{the wagon rattles over roots and stones; it sways and creaks. now the horse stops with his ears flat against his head. the forest sighs and stirs ponderously.}
<C>__{jof}
<D>__{get into the wagon, mia. crawl in quickly. we'll lie down, mia, with mikael between us.}
<A>__{they crawl into the wagon and crouch around the sleeping child.}
<C>__{jof}
<D>__{it is the angel of death that's passing over us, mia. it's the angel of death. the angel of death, and he's very big.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{do you feel how cold it is? i'm freezing. i'm terribly cold.}
<A>__{she shivers as if she had a fever. they pull the blankets over them and lie closely together. the wagon canvas flutters and beats in the wind. the roar outside is like a giant bellowing. the castle is silhouetted like a black boulder against the heavy dawn. now the storm moves there, throwing itself powerfully against walls and abutments. the sky darkens; it is almost like night. antonius block has brought his companions with him to the castle. but it seems deserted. they walk from room to room. there is only emptiness and quiet echoes. outside, the rain is heard roaring noisily. suddenly the knight stands face to face with his wife. they look at each other quietly.}
<C>__{karin}
<D>__{i heard from people who came from the crusade that you were on your way home. i've been waiting for you here. all the others have fled from the plague.}
<A>__{the knight is silent. he looks at her.}
<C>__{karin}
<D>__{don't you recognize me any more?}
<A>__{the knight nods, silent.}
<C>__{karin}
<D>__{you also have changed.}
<A>__{she walks closer and looks searchingly into his face. the smile lingers in her eyes and she touches his hand lightly.}
<C>__{karin}
<D>__{now i can see that it's you. somewhere in your eyes, somewhere in your face, but hidden and frightened, is that boy who went away so many years ago.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{it's over now and i'm a little tired.}
<C>__{karin}
<D>__{i see that you're tired.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{over there stand my friends.}
<C>__{karin}
<D>__{ask them in. they will break the fast with us.}
<A>__{they all sit down at the table in the room, which is lit by torches on the walls. silently they eat the hard bread and the salt darkened meat. karin sits at the head of the table and reads aloud from a thick book.}
<C>__{karin}
<D>__{"and when the lamb broke the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about the space of half an hour. and i saw the seven angels which stood before god; and to them were given seven trumpets. and another ..."}
<A>__{three mighty knocks sound on the large portal. karin interrupts her reading and looks up from the book. jons rises quickly and goes to open the door.}
<C>__{karin}
<D>__{"the first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth; and the third part of the trees was burnt up and all the green grass was burnt up."}
<A>__{now the rain becomes quiet. there is suddenly an immense, frightening silence in the large, murky room where the burning torches throw uneasy shadows over the ceiling and the walls. everyone listens tensely to the stillness.}
<C>__{karin}
<D>__{"and the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and a third part of the sea became blood ..."}
<A>__{steps are heard on the stairs. jons returns and sits down silently at his place but does not continue to eat.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{was someone there?}
<C>__{jons}
<D>__{no, my lord. i saw no one.}
<A>__{karin lifts her head for a moment but once again leans over the large book.}
<C>__{karin}
<D>__{"and the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters; and the name of the star is called wormwood ..."}
<A>__{they all lift their heads, and when they see who is coming towards them through the twilight of the large room, they rise from the table and stand close together.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{good morning, noble lord.}
<C>__{karin}
<D>__{i am karin, the knight's wife, and welcome you courteously to my house.}
<C>__{plog}
<D>__{i am a smith by profession and rather good at my trade, if i say so myself. my wife lisa curtsy for the great lord, lisa. she's a little difficult to handle once in a while and we had a little spat, so to speak, but no worse than most people.}
<A>__{the knight hides his face in his hands.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{from our darkness, we call out to thee, lord. have mercy on us because we are small and frightened and ignorant.}
<C>__{jons}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{in the darkness where you are supposed to be, where all of us probably are.... in the darkness you will find no one to listen to your cries or be touched by your sufferings. wash your tears and mirror yourself in your indifference.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{god, you who are somewhere, who must be somewhere, have mercy upon us.}
<C>__{jons}
<D>__{i could have given you an herb to purge you of your worries about eternity. now it seems to be too late. but in any case, feel the immense triumph of this last minute when you can still roll your eyes and move your toes.}
<C>__{karin}
<D>__{quiet, quiet.}
<C>__{jons}
<D>__{i shall be silent, but under protest.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(on her knees)}
<D>__{it is the end.}
<A>__{jof and mia sit close together and listen to the rain tapping lightly on the wagon canvas, a sound which diminishes until finally there are only single drops. they crawl out of their hiding place. the wagon stands on a height above a slope, protected by an enormous tree. they look across ridges, forests, the wide plains, and the sea, which glistens in the sunlight breaking through the clouds. jof stretches his arms and legs. mia dries the wagon seat and sits down next to her husband. mikael crawls between jof's knees. a lone bird tests its voice after the storm. the trees and bushes drip. from the sea comes a strong and fragrant wind. jof points to the dark, retreating sky where summer lightning glitters like silver needles over the horizon.}
<C>__{jof}
<D>__{i see them, mia! i see them! over there against the dark, stormy sky. they are all there. the smith and lisa and the knight and raval and jns and skat. and death, the severe master, invites them to dance. he tells them to hold each other's hands and then they must tread the dance in a long row. and first goes the master with his scythe and hourglass, but skat dangles at the end with his lyre. they dance away from the dawn and it's a solemn dance towards the dark lands, while the rain washes their faces and cleans the salt of the tears from their cheeks.}
<A>__{he is silent. he lowers his hand. his son, mikael, has listened to his words. now, he crawls up to mia and sits down in her lap.}
<C>__{mia}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you with your visions and dreams.}
