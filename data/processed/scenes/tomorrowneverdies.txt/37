<L>__{007 is now hanging, fifteen feet above a glass skylight... as thug #1}
<A>__{tumbles off the edge of the roof, and saves himself by grabbing onto bond's legs. they sway in the air for a second. the gutter bends, breaks, and the two of them fall crashing through the glass skylight, into: venice medieval armor museum night. they land in a shower of glass on the grand banquet table in the great hall. bond is winded. thug #1, unfazed. he grabs bond by the collar, hauling him up on his feet. thug #1 shoves the nose of his gun under bond's chin, forcing 007 up on his toes. snarling, he thrusts his face menacingly close to bond:}
<D>__{thug #1 i owe you some pain.}
<A>__{with lightning speed, bond: 1) grasps the thug's elbow and yanks his gun arm forward, as, 2) bond pitches his head back. bond's chin just clears the barrel as the gun fires into the ceiling. the flash momentarily blinds thug #1. bond snatches a candelabra, and smashes it against the thug's arm, knocking the gun away. as bond draws his walther, the thug grabs bond's wrist, and brutally (yet effortlessly) squeezes the gun from 007's hand, onto the floor. with a sick smile, the thug tosses bond into a corner of the room. he's having fun. as bond staggers, picking himself up from the corner thug #1 tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at bond. bond shoves a suit of armor (on wheels) at thug #1 who bats it out of the way, like a gnat. concerned this might be getting serious, bond grabs an oak leg from the shattered table. he wields it like a bat, to ward off the thug. unimpressed, the thug smashes his fist into a glass display table, and plucks out a claymore a two handed "king arthur" type sword. with one roundhouse blow, thug #1 slices bond's table leg in two. the thug swings the claymore a second time, forcing bond back to: a display wall filled with pole weapons. bond snatches a lethal looking halberd. (ax, fluke and spike on a staff.) thug #1 stops in his tracks. drops the claymore. grabs a pole ax. the two men face off in a short, furious battle, which ends with thug #1 shattering bond's halberd with the pole ax. new angle gripping the pole ax horizontally in both hands, thug #1 forces bond backward, to a second display wall that features an iron maiden. (something like a hinged sarcophagus, lined with spikes.) thug #1 tries to push 007 into the case, but bond side steps at the last minute. thug #1 lurches forward, and is only stopped from killing himself by the pole ax hitting the sides of the iron maiden. as thug #1 steps back, bond grabs a morning star from the wall. (a studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club) bond swings the morning star down, snapping thug #1's pole ax in two... but loses the weapon in the process. now, thug #1 lunges for bond's throat. grappling, they slam into the wall next to the iron maiden which is starting to come loose from the leather straps holding it upright. in a near death grip, bond manages to push kick smash thug #1 backwards, down onto the floor. and as bond reaches up for another weapon a hand ax thug #1 lunges for bond's gun on the floor. bond can't get the hand ax off the wall. he turns to see: thug #1 about to shoot him. and at the very last second, bond dislodges the hand ax, slashes the iron maiden's leather retaining straps and new angle from inside the iron maiden's pov the iron maiden falls forward, impaling thug #1 on the wooden floor. return to scene the iron maiden covers all of thug #1, except for his arm, still clutching bond's gun. bond bends down and retrieves it.}
