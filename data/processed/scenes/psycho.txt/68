<A>__{mary is seated at the small desk, engrossed in figuring in a small notebook. we see from these figures a calculation which indicates her intention to make a restitution of the money she has used of the forty thousand dollars. we see, too, her bankbook. the paper reads thus: top figure, 40,000; directly beneath it 500, the amount used for the new car; total after subtraction, 39,500. in another spot we see a figure which matches the balance in her bankbook; 624.00. beneath this is the figure 500, and the amount after subtraction, 124.00. she studies the figures, sighs, not wearily but with a certain satisfaction, with the pleasure that comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to continue doing the right thing. after a moment she tears the page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into small pieces. she goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces into the toilet bowl, flushes the toilet. then she drops her robe and steps into the tub and turns the shower on.}
