<A>__{suddenly nancy feels utterly exposed. she shivers, chilled and vulnerable to the bone in her thin night clothes. she can't move. it's as if some great nerve between her instincts and body had been severed. and she hears the sound behind her. a sort of filling vibrating scrriiitchh . music sneaks in the unmistakeable nightmare theme, creeping over her. nancy forces herself, by sheer will, to look. ahead of her perhaps twenty five feet, covered with a thick plastic body bag through which we can barely see her face, is tina. standing square in the middle of the street. a dark ooze of black eels roil out of its bottom, and at its top, the zipper chatters down and the greenish white face of tina lolls out. she gestures, supplicating, her watery eyes desperate to convey some desperate message. the music falls to a hush. nancy backs away, eyes streaming tears.}
