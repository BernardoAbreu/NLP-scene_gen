<L>__{interior van day}
<A>__{korda floors it, and we get a frightening view out the windshield as they head straight downhill. the salesgirl is beyond petrified.}
<B>__{the cadillac}
<A>__{reaches the top of the hill. going fast.}
<L>__{interior cadillac}
<A>__{as it rocks forward violently. front bumper slamming against the pavement. mccall sees the van ahead. hammers the accelerator. no fear.}
<B>__{van}
<A>__{korda sees traffic ahead... intersection jammed. he pulls a hard left.}
<B>__{the van}
<A>__{cuts straight across the corner... up on the sidewalk... shears a mailbox... a row of newspaper machines fly through the air... the van speeds off down a one way street...}
<B>__{the cadillac}
<A>__{arrives at the intersection a few seconds later... intersection still jammed... people now standing on the corner gawking at the damage. the caddy screeches to a stop. mccall honks... the people scatter... the cadillac drives through the corner.}
<B>__{the van}
<A>__{wrong way down a one way street. cars coming right at us in every angle. frantic honking. salesgirl shrieks. tires smoking... no way to avoid collision... except korda pulls a left an instant before impact... the van speeds back up the hill.}
<B>__{the cadiliac}
<A>__{down the same one way street... comes up on the head on traffic, now stopped, paralyzed with fear from the near collision with korda...}
