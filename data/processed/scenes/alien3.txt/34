<L>__{interior sloping corridor night}
<A>__{this hallway slopes downwards a few degrees. the three find themselves trotting, leaning backward to keep their balance.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{all right, let's forget about the past and get on to our survival. no more prisoners behind us?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{not for years.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{okay if the alien's had a few days to lay his eggs our only hope is to get off this what is this?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{arceon.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{satellite.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{get to my ship and get off this satellite.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we can't.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{we can't what?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{leave arceon. can't leave the library }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{a tape library?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{books.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{the reason we are out here. like the monks who guarded monastery libraries on remote islands off england during the first plague }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{there must be books on other colonies }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{some of these books survived the burning of the libraries of alexandria. they contain knowledge that exists in no other record. their value is unestimable.}
<A>__{he runs his hand along the spine of the book in his bag.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we're supposed to protect them.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(to anthony)}
<D>__{and what does an android have to do with all this?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{he's a spy.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{the company planted me here.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{the company? what does the company have to do with this?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{they built this prison.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{prison?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{colony.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{prison. they are all political heretics.}
<A>__{ripley looks at john.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you left that part out.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{the order was more of a counter culture, a reaction to the technology that was beginning to take over everyone's lives. it was a simple enough idea read, don't watch disk. walk, don't pump more carbons into the air. the earliest members renounced technology. started to collect the remaining books. nobody would have noticed if it hadn't been for the virus.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{your abbot talked about that. the new plague.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{a computer virus. a bad program. by this time the corporate structure was transglobal, all the world's data storage systems were linked. it spread through two countries before it was stopped.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{after a scare like that, thousands flocked to our retreat. people started clamoring for written information. for our books. they abandoned the modern ways }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i think i can see how this comes out. they gave up their possessions.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{this was a threat }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{to the company.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{they sold the technology. a movement to live simply was quickly twisted by federal agents into a political movement against the company controlled world government. too much was at stake.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{too much profit.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we were sentenced as political dissidents. this orbiter is our gulag. all the men were packed up with all our books, and towed into space. ten thousand men. the eldest died very quickly.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{the company had such a sense of irony. sending you out on this wooden tub.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i was placed among them as a sensor. keeps tabs on the movement.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{so how'd they find out about you?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i told them. after the supply ship's stopped coming i saw no point in keeping up the charade. since i was a sort of walking reminder of technology, they cast me down.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{join the club.}
<P>__{(to john)}
<D>__{i figured this wasn't planned. you don't have to be a genius to see it wouldn't be prudent to try to preserve man's written works for generations without women.}
<A>__{john looks embarrassed.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{and i don't know about your new plague, but i was just on earth and everything's fine.}
<A>__{john has a doubtful look.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i was right about the alien, wasn't i? means i must be right about the earth.}
<A>__{the logic behind her argument is uncomfortable.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{perhaps.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{that's better than nothing. come on.}
<A>__{they reach the end of the corridor. it opens into }
