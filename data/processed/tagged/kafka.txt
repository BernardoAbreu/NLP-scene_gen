<A>__{prague morning the old town is quiet. it's very early in the twisted streets of this ancient ghetto. dark corners casting a medieval spell over a modern century oblivious to their romance and mystery. the river is the dividing line. elegant gardens on the opposite bank embracing the monotonous solemnity of the new town, tower steeples silhouetted against the sombre sky. an empty motor bus rattles along a deserted street. a gothic bridge links the two halves of the strange city. its half moon arches becoming circles as they meet their reflections in the water. thin mist swirls over the cobblestones above. a few boats in the water. fishermen casting their lines in silence. one or two lights now burning in buildings beyond. in the old town square the great clock on the cathedral strikes six.}

<B>__{around a corner}
<A>__{eduard appears suddenly, quickly flattens himself back against the large notice board that covers the wall here, layers of expressionistic theatre and film posters pasted on it. he breathes painfully in short bursts, as silently as he can. he watches the corner he's just come from, the ornate archway through which any pursuer must emerge. nothing there. but then a shadow moves. eduard's shoulders tense. his eyes widen. he holds his breath. the shadow ... spreading ... eduard edges away ever so slowly, keeping his unblinking gaze on the archway, backing off, one arm brushing the notice board as he feels his way along it, macabre images on the posters, some torn and incomplete, revealing other fragments behind, eduard's eyes staring constant, no noise here at all and a hand! clamps over his face from behind. all of a sudden and out of absolutely nowhere and not a thing he can do about it. but he tries, his hands coming up to grip the arm that grasps him, an arm of iron. the hand is huge. it covers eduard's face almost entirely, only one eye gaping bloodshot through the fingers, ghastly fingers that, just for a second, seem almost inhuman, perhaps even fingers that seem incompatible on the same hand, a hand covered in scar tissue, starting to squeeze as it pulls eduard swiftly away.}

<B>__{the bridge}
<A>__{kafka giddily staggers forward, one arm wrapped around his bleeding chest, gabriela close behind him. too close for him to get away. he turns to face her as he reaches the bridge and as she comes upon him again with the knife, raising his arm to block the thrust and hold her wrist back. she's strong, though, made more so by her madness. she forces him down to the ground, straddling him, the knife pushing closer. kafka gasps in pain, finally succumbs, no longer able to hold his hand up in defense, simply shutting his eyes with a terrible sigh to await the fatal stab. it doesn't come. almost. but not quite. gabriela's arm pauses, shaking in the cool, cloudy air, her sleeve trembling in the breeze off the river, the sharp blade, inches from kafka's throat, flashing in the new day's light. gabriela stares away over the river, the destroyed half of her face in shadow again, the other more strikingly beautiful than ever. as kafka watches, passive, she gets off him and slowly walks to the wall of the bridge, letting the knife drop from her hand along the way. kafka manages to lift himself to his knees, clutching his wound. he looks up. gabriela in one graceful movement climbs over the wall and throws herself into the river. kafka lowers his head.}
