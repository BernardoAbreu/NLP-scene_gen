<L>__{exterior atlantic ocean. day.}
<A>__{darkness suddenly descends as storm clouds roll towards truman's boat at an alarming speed. high winds buffet the boat. truman fights the wheel. hurricane force winds shake the masts and keel, ripping the sails to shreds. the picture of sylvia is torn from the compass and lost to the sea. his "how to sail" book skids off the deck. truman takes a rope from beneath the wheel house and lashes himself to the wheel to secure himself on board.}

<P>__{(shouting above the storm)}
<D>__{i'm coming to find you sylvia! i'm making myself deaf!}
<P>__{(screaming up to the sky)}
<D>__{you're going to have to kill me! come on!}
<A>__{monstrous waves continually submerge the deck. truman continues to head into the teeth of the gale.}
