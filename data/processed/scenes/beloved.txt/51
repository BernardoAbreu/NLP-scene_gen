<L>__{exterior country road day.}
<A>__{our trio are leaving the carnival, walking three astride with distance in between each. the sunlight casts strong shadows. sethe's eyes glance towards the ground behind them and sees; their three shadows are holding hands.....as they walk home.}
<T>__{fade out: fade in:}
<L>__{exterior a stream and the bank beside it day.}
<A>__{wide angle of a beautiful, wide stream (more like a small river) with a mulberry tree standing tall on the bank before it. there is not a soul in sight as the stream moves gracefully beneath the sun. suddenly;}
<B>__{a fully dressed young black woman emerges from the middle of the stream like a goddess arising out of spiritual waters...}
<A>__{she wears a straw hatt a white dress with buttons, a lace}
<B>__{collar and new shoes. she walks out of the water to the bank.}
<A>__{exhausted, sopping wet and breathing heavily as if from asthma, she sits, leaning against the mulberry tree. she seems too tired to even hold her head upon her neck. yet her skin is like new lineless and smooth. glowing. although racked with pain, she is smiling. smiling the way travellers smile when they have finally arrived after a long and arduous journey.}
