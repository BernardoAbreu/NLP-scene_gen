<L>__{exterior camp 8 yard day}
<A>__{claude storms across the yard and stops at the gun line. ray is a few steps behind.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{yo, blocker, what's going on here?}
<C>__{blocker}
<D>__{kid's getting out. i got him a pardon.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{yeah, but what about me and ray? i didn't see our names on that pardon. you said you were gonna put in a good word for us.}
<C>__{blocker}
<D>__{i did, claude. i mentioned you. i mentioned you both. but the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. the kid can hit. what can you do?}
<A>__{this hits claude hard.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{let it go, claude.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i'm not gonna let it go. the man needs to explain himself. makin' promises.}
<C>__{blocker}
<D>__{look, i am truly sorry about this. i'd like to help you...}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{but you can't.}
<C>__{blocker}
<D>__{at least the kid's getting out. isn't this what you wanted?}
<A>__{claude looks around as the incorrigibles begin to gather. he's on the spot. dillard approaches with can't get right. claude looks into the big kid's eyes.}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(resigned)}
<D>__{yeah. of course it is.}
<A>__{steeling himself to the reality of the situation, claude gives can't get right a hug.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you show them crawfords how to play ball.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{make 'em throw strikes.}
<A>__{can't get right nods. he steps up to the gun line and looks at both shooter shacks.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{it's alright. you're a free man now.}
<A>__{can't get right steps across the gun line. blocker opens the car door for him. but before he climbs in, can't get right reaches into his pocket and pulls out his rubber ball. with a smile, he tosses it to claude, who snatches it out of the air.}
<C>__{blocker}
<D>__{don't worry, we'll take good care of him.}
<A>__{blocker tips his hat and climbs behind the wheel. claude and ray watch blocker's car drive off under a red mississippi sunset. slowly, the inmates drift back toward the bunkhouse until ray an claude are left alone at the gun line.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{one of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. he said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i'm not in the mood right now, ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{he said they keep it parked out behind the barn. can't be that hard to fly a plane. lots of people do it.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{they're called pilots! i'm serious, ray. i'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked up plans right now.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i don't see you coming up with any plans.}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(getting mad)}
<D>__{my plan is on his way to pittsburgh right now. that congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. don't you feel a little disgusted right now?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{crop duster.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i ain't getting in no airplane with you. i'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. they threw us in this shithole for life. don't you get it, ray? we're gonna die here! might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.}
<A>__{suddenly enraged, ray hauls off and knocks claude down with a solid right. surprised, claude touches his bloody lip.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{my daddy died in prison. he gave up hope and hung himself. what you're talking about is the same damn thing. that ain't how i'm going.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{maybe you're fooling yourself, ray. maybe you're just a chip off the old block.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{take that back or we ain't friends no more, claude banks.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{here's a news flash, ray. we never were friends. we've just been stuck together for 12 years. it's been nothing but bad luck since the moment i ran into you. every time i look at you i get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if i'd never bumped into ray gibson.}
<A>__{a hard look comes to ray's eyes as claude rises to his feet.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{better watch yourself claude, before you say something you regret.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{the only thing i regret is the day i met you.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{well, if that's the way it is...}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{that's the way it is.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{then i have nothing left to say to you.}
<A>__{ray walks away, leaving claude to nurse his split lip.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you never said nothing of value anyway.}
