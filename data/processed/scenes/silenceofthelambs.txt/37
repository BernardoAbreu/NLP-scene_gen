<L>__{exterior quinn's hospital parking lot night (raining)}
<A>__{a loud clap of thunder, as a flash of lightning illuminates the eerie towers and barred windows of the asylum. moving angle on clarice as she climbs from her car, runs through heavy rain towards the main entrance, where a guard admits her.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior dr. lecter's cell and corridor night (dim light)}
<A>__{on a noiseless tv screen, an evangelist rants, waving his arms. behind him, a swaying choir in gaudy robes.}
<C>__{clarice }
<D>__{it's an anagram, isn't it, doctor?}
<A>__{pan to clarice, with her wet hair plastered flat, sitting on the corridor floor to one side of this tv, which has been stationed so that dr. lecter cannot avoid seeing it.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{hester mofet... "the rest of me." miss the rest of me... meaning, you rented that place.}
<B>__{her pov}
<A>__{he's lost in shadows; we can't see him. he doesn't respond.}
<B>__{cutting between them}
<A>__{clarice and the darkened call as she tries again.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{you put those things in there. paid for it in advance, ten years ago... why, dr. lecter?}
<A>__{the food carrier suddenly swishes out of the cell, making her jump up. in its tray is a clean, folded white towel. she hesitates, then crosses, takes this.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{she sits again, rubbing her wet hair. when he finally speaks, he's on the floor, too a deeper, hunching darkness in the shadows, occasionally striped by the flickering tv light.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{your bleeding has stopped.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{how did }
<P>__{(she stops herself)}
<D>__{it's nothing. a scratch.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{why don't you ask me about buffalo bill?}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(surprised, a beat)}
<D>__{why? do you know something about him?}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{i might if i saw the case file. you could get that for me.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{why don't you tell me about "miss mofet?" you wanted me to find him. or do i have to wait for the lab?}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{his real name is benjamin raspail. a former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? i didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. very much as i found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. you'd have him under "missing person" which, in poor raspail's case, could hardly be more true.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{if you didn't kill him, then who did?}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{who can say...? best thing for him, really. his therapy was going nowhere.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{and have them clomping about in my life? oh dear, no... at that time i still had certain private amusements of my own.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how did you feel when you saw him, clarice? may i call you clarice?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{scared, at first. then exhilarated.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{ahhh... why?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{because you weren't wasting my time.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i don't know. next time i will have to check.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{jack crawford is helping your career, isn't he? apparently he likes you. and you like him, too.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i never thought about it.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{your first lie to me, clarice. how sad. tell me do you think crawford wants you, sexually? true, he's much older, but do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? fucking you?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{that doesn't interest me, doctor. and it's the sort of thing miggs would ask.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{not anymore.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, clarice. crawford dangles you before me. then i give you a bit of help. do you think it's because i like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i don't know. is it?}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? there's something crawford can give me, and i want to trade for it. i even wrote to him, offering my help. but he hates me, so he won't deal directly.}
<A>__{dr. lecter slowly turns up the rheostat in his cell. as his lights rise, we see that the cell's been stripped bare. gone are his books, drawings, mattress even his toilet seat. she stands, too, startled. they face each other.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{punishment, you see. for miggs. just like that gospel program. when you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. chilton does enjoy his petty torments.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{who killed raspail, doctor...? you know, don't you?}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{i've been in this room for eight years, clarice. i know they will never, ever let me out while i'm alive. what i want is a view. i want a window where i can see a tree, or even water. i want to be in a federal institution, away from chilton and i want a view. i will give good value for it. crawford could do that for me, but he won't. you persuade him.}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(almost a whisper)}
<D>__{who killed your patient?}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{oh, a very naughty boy. someone you and jack crawford are most anxious to meet.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{buffalo bill...?}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{bill killed him, all those years ago...? that's impossible.}
<A>__{but dr. lecter only smiles, enigmatically.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{who is he stalking right now, clarice? i wonder, don't you? how many more young women will have to die, before you trade with me...?}
<A>__{as clarice stares at him, unsure how to respond }
