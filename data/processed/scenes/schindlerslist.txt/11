<L>__{exterior garden scherner's residence cracow day}
<A>__{as oberfuhrer scherner and his daughter, in a wedding gown, dance to the music of a quartet on a bandstand, the reception guests drink and eat at tables set up on an expansive lawn.}
<C>__{czurda}
<D>__{the ss doesn't own the trains, somebody's got to pay. whether it's a passenger car or a livestock car, it doesn't matter which, by the way, you have to see. you have to set aside an afternoon, go down to the station and see this.}
<A>__{other ss and army officers share the table with czurda. schindler, too, nice blue shirt, jacket, only he doesn't seem to be paying attention; rather his attention and affections are directed to the blonde next to him, ingrid.}
<C>__{czurda}
<D>__{so you got thousands of fares that have to be paid. since it's the ss that's reserved the trains, logically they should pay. but this is a lot of money.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{the jews. they're the ones riding the trains, they should pay. so you got jews paying their own fares to ride on cattle cars to god knows where. they pay the ss full fare, the ss turns around, pays the railroad a reduced excursion fare, and pockets the difference.}
<A>__{he shrugs, there you have it. brilliant. he glances off, sees something odd across the yard. two horses, saddled up, being led into the garden by a stable boy.}
<C>__{schindler}
<P>__{(to ingrid)}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{schindler gets up from the table. scherner, his wife and daughter and son in law stare at the horses; they're beautiful. schindler appears, takes the reins from the stable boy, hands one set to the bride and the other to the groom.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{there's nothing more sacred than marriage. no happier an occasion than one's wedding day. i wish you all the best.}
<A>__{scherner hails a photographer. as the guy comes over with his camera, so does just about everybody else. scherner insists schindler pose with the astonished bride and groom. big smiles. flash.}
