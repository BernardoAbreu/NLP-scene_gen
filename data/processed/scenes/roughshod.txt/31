<L>__{exterior desert road day}
<A>__{close shot. a woman's hat lies on the rocky earth. it is a big, elaborate affair. o.s. there is the sound of hoofbeats, the squeal of a wagon brake and the jangle of harness. camera pulls back and angle widens to reveal clay's wagon coming down a very steep hill. steve is driving, holding tightly to the reins and riding the brake. seeing the hat, he yells to clay.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{another one, clay.}
<A>__{clay rides over and, swinging down, picks it up.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{angled down hill. the road twists tortuously down. near the bottom it swings sharply at right angles into a dry wash. the banks shut out further view of the road. near where the road turns a trunk lies at the side. it has broken open and some of the contents are spilled out in the dust. clay rides to it, reins in his horse and looks down. steve, with difficulty, pulls the mules to a stop alongside.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{featuring trunk and wagon. clay swings out of his saddle, starts tossing the clothes back in the trunk. steve jumps down.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{they sure must have been travelin'. this keeps up we can start a store.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.}
<A>__{steve holds up a petticoat close to his body and grins.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i'd look good doin' the ploughin' in this.}
<A>__{clay takes it from him, puts it in the trunk and shuts the lid. steve helps him hoist the trunk into the wagon bed. steve gets back in the seat. just as clay is about to mount, he stops and picks up a small folding daguerrotype case delicately ornamented. he lifts his eyebrow, tucks the case into his pocket, then mounts and starts ahead around the bend.}
<B>__{med. long shot}
<A>__{clay's angle. ahead, off the road in the wash is the surrey that passed graham's buckboard at the fork. clay spurs his horse forward.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{on surrey. the back wheel is broken and the bed of the surrey rests on the ground. the horses have been taken from the traces and stand dejectedly in the hot sun. a blanket is spread in the scant shade thrown by the surrey. on it lies elaine and, sitting beside her, is marcia. a damp cloth is spread across elaine's forehead. a water bag hangs from the surrey. elaine's head is pillowed on a dainty satin cushion. helen and mary have risen at clay's approach and now stand by the road.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{clay gallops forward to pull up near the surrey. in the b.g. steve drives the wagon around the bend. clay dismounts.}
<B>__{med. group shot}
<A>__{clay drops his reins and hurries up.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{anybody hurt?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no. we came down the hill a little fast and...}
<P>__{(rueful)}
<D>__{...the wheel broke.}
<P>__{(hopefully)}
<D>__{can you fix it for us?}
<A>__{clay bends over elaine.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what's the matter with her?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{too much excitement. how about the surrey. can you fix it?}
<A>__{clay turns from elaine and gives his attention to the surrey.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{on rear of surrey. in the b.g. steve pulls the wagon to a stop, jumps off, and comes running over.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{jimininy. you sure were lucky, just bustin' a wheel.}
<A>__{helen moves toward clay. she miles without humor.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(rubbing thigh)}
<D>__{you think that'sall we busted you should see...}
<A>__{clay stops her with a look, goes around, and kicks the unbroken back wheel. the spokes rattle.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{this must have been in the family a long time.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{it was a gift from the citizens of aspen. i'm mary wells.}
<A>__{she looks at him to see if the name registers.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{and this is helen carter.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm clay phillips.}
<P>__{(motioning)}
<D>__{my brother steve.}
<A>__{steve tugs at his battered hat.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(shy)}
<D>__{pleased to meet you, ma'am.}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{we found your trunk. were you doin' the driven'?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i was at first. then i was hanging on.}
<P>__{(to clay)}
<D>__{are you going far?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{as far as sonora?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{just about.}
<A>__{mary and helen exchange glances.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we're going to sonora, too, so that solves everything.}
<A>__{clay takes the makings from his pocket, starts to roll a cigarette.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we can ride in your wagon.}
<A>__{steve looks at clay hopefully. he likes the prospect of having these lovely women along.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we wouldn't think of asking you to take us for nothing.}
<A>__{clay finishes the cigarette, starts to put the makings back. mary holds out her hand. clay gives her the makings. mary speaks as she casually rolls a cigarette.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{there's only four of us.}
<A>__{clay motions to the remuda that grazes in the b.g.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i've got eleven horses.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{morgan blood. the beat in nevada. clay and me have a place on the toulomne river. we're going to raise horses like these.}
<A>__{mary has finished rolling her cigarette. she passes the bag to helen, who starts rolling one.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{they won't be riding in the wagon.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over sonora pass? it's quite a job.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you can't leave us here.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{course i can't. i will give you a lift to the first ranch.}
<A>__{helen has finished her cigarette. she passes the makings to steve. he hesitates, looks at his brother and, when he sees clay is occupied with mary, starts rolling one.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{what good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(amiably)}
<D>__{you can stay here if you like.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we have to get to sonora. there are jobs waiting for us there. we'll pay you for your trouble.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and i can't take a chance on losing the horses.}
<A>__{steve finishes his cigarette. again he hesitates, then not wanting to seem young in front of these women he takes a bold step and lights it. clay reaches over and takes it from him. mary watches the byplay.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{when you're old enough to smoke, i will tell you.}
<P>__{(kind)}
<D>__{get the horses started on ahead, will you, steve?}
<A>__{steve, embarrassed and hurt, turns quickly away. helen looks after the boy.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{afraid it will stop him growin'?}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{let's get your stuff in the wagon. like i said, i will take you to the first ranch. i wish i could carry you all the way, but i can't. it's a tough trip and women would be in the way.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{our kind of women?}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(ignores that)}
<D>__{you'll have to drive except down hill.}
<A>__{he lifts some things out of the surrey and carries them toward the wagon.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{maybe you're going about this all wrong. why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. that usually works.}
<P>__{(then shocked at the thought)}
<D>__{yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. where would we be?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{maybe in sonora.}
<A>__{she starts around the surrey. helen follows. clay bends over elaine.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what's the matter with her?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{too much excitement. or maybe it's just the heat. how about the surrey. can you fix it?}
<A>__{as clay turns from elaine, marcia joins the other two, their attention on clay and the surrey. left alone, elaine is suddenly alert and no longer sick. she glances around, then unobserved slides out from under the shade of the surrey.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{on rear of surrey. in the b.g. steve pulls the wagon to a stop, jumps off, and comes running over. elaine stands for a moment, searching the ground with her eyes.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{jiminy. you sure were lucky, just bustin' a wheel.}
<A>__{helen moves toward clay. she smiles without humor. with this new diversion, elaine, still unnoticed, starts away back toward where they dropped the trunk.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(rubbing thigh)}
<D>__{you think that's all we busted you should see...}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(sees elaine)}
<D>__{now where's she goin'? }
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(half turns without stopping)}
<D>__{i lost something.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it wouldn't happen to be this...}
<A>__{elaine stops now and turns as clay takes the folding daguerrotype case from his pocket. elaine, her eyes wide and frightened, starts back as mary takes the case from clay and opens it.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{who's the old folks?}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(frantic)}
<D>__{give it to me!}
<A>__{she jerks the case from mary's hands, snaps it shut, and stands staring at mary with a strange mixture of fright, anger and hysteria. mary glances around as if to say what did i do? to cover the embarrassed silence, clay kicks the unbroken back wheel. the spokes rattle.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{this must have been in the family a long time.}
<A>__{elaine glances at him as though he had insulted her, turns and starts toward the blanket again.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{it was a gift from the citizens of aspen. i'm mary wells.}
<A>__{she looks at him to see if the name registers. at the surrey side, elaine is abruptly weak again. she leans against it for support. mareia moves to her as she slides back down on the blanket, clutching the case.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{and this is helen carter.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm clay phillips.}
<P>__{(motioning)}
<D>__{my brother steve.}
<A>__{steve tugs at his battered hat.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(shy)}
<D>__{pleased to meet you, ma'am.}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{we found your trunk. were you doin' the drivin'?}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{mary and helen come around the end of the surrey to where elaine lies. mary bends beside the sick girl and lifts the cloth from the girl's forehead.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{come on, honeybunch. we're changing trains.}
<A>__{the sick girl sits up. she looks around her dully.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{a nice, kind wrangler is letting us ride in his wagon...}
<A>__{assisted by mary, elaine gets to her feet. mary puts her arm around her.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{...as far as the first ranch. from then on }
<A>__{elaine stops. she looks fearfully up at helen.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{what ranch?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{what's the difference?}
<A>__{she tries to lead the girl toward the wagon.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(fierce)}
<D>__{ask him what ranch }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{there's plenty of time for that.}
<P>__{(sharp)}
<D>__{come on, now. you've got to lie down out of this sun. stop worrying. i will find out what ranch after a while.}
<A>__{she pulls the girl with her toward the wagon.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{on wagon. clay, in the wagon bed, is stowing his gear in the back. mary, supporting elaine, reaches the wagon. seeing the girls, clay reaches down and gently lifts elaine up. mary climbs in beside him.}
<B>__{med. close}
<A>__{wagon bed. clay has unrolled a bedroll under the seat where there is a little shade.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(kind)}
<D>__{stretch out under the seat, miss.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{which ranch?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{how's that?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{she's worried about where you're taking us.}
<A>__{as she speaks, mary helps the girl down under the seat, then rises to face clay.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{so am i.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it's a nice place owned by an old couple named wyatt.}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{elaine as she hears the name. she is shocked.}
<C>__{clay's voice}
<D>__{they'll take you in until you can make other arrangements.}
<B>__{two shot}
<A>__{clay and mary. clay vaults out of the wagon, camera angle widens, he looks up.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{so both of you stop worrying.}
<A>__{he turns away and hurries back to the surrey.}
