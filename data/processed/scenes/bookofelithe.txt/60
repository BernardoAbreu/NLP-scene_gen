<A>__{eli and solara stand in the doorway, looking out on the yard. solara is horrified by what she sees. the entire back yard is a graveyard. maybe twenty human graves dug shallow into the earth. some were dug long ago, others look like they're very recent.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{are these... graves?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{of course. it would be uncivilized not to bury them. we're not barbarians.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{plus, it's good for the soil.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{come on back inside. i think i might be able to rustle up some sandwiches.}
<A>__{george and martha go back inside, leaving eli and solara gazing at the little graveyard.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{we have to get out of here.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{they look so sweet... i would never have believed they were killers.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{they're worse than that.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{they didn't just kill these people.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they ate them.}
<A>__{solara is stunned.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{they what?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{there's a disease in the outland. spread by eating human meat. it affects the brain. dementia, loss of motor function. did you notice the old woman's hands shaking? she's got it. they've both got it.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{oh my god...}
