<A>__{last seen at the troops christmas party, the inner courtyard has been transformed into an elegant outdoor banquet, with band. the almasy madox team is assembled for a farewell dinner. they are waiting for almasy to arrive, his seat conspicuously empty. he is very late. and then he's there, dangerous drunk, terribly dashing. he practically dances to his chair, which he drags violently away from its position opposite katharine. he bows to lady hampton.}
