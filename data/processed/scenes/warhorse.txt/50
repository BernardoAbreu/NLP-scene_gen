<L>__{exterior german camp various. evening.}
<A>__{soldiers are lifting up their equipment gathering moving in the same direction. in a quiet tent, a few last soldiers are packing. and there are gunther and michael, packing together.}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{you are not going. i will tell them you are only fourteen, that you're a boy.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{father signed me in. he knew my age and so do they.}
<A>__{the process of packing is their way of coping with the shock. gunther is folding one of michael's shirts. michael takes it back...}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{mother obviously never taught you how to fold a shirt.}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{of course she did. i just wasn't listening. but you need to listen now! i promised her, i made her a solemn promise, that you would be safe with me. with me, michael!!}
<A>__{he leans close to michael, talking in almost a whisper.}
<C>__{gunther }
<D>__{they'll never make a head count. there are too many of us. you can stay here slip underneath the bed until they move out.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{then what?}
<A>__{michael carries on with his packing.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{gunther, it will be fine. and when all the machines break down and they call up the horses, i will see you at the front. we'll be together again.}
<A>__{and now the case is packed. gunther heads to the tent opening.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{gunther...}
<A>__{looking round, the tent is now empty. the moment to leave has come. gunther pulls the red pennant from his pocket and follows michael out of the tent to where the soldiers are lining up in the road.}
<C>__{gunther}
<D>__{i'm giving this to you. for luck.}
<A>__{gunther ties the pennant to the back of michael's pack as he forms up.}
<C>__{gunther }
<D>__{to keep you safe.}
<A>__{michael smiles at him and begins to march. marching towards ypres, on the western front.}
<C>__{base camp officer}
<D>__{im schnellschritt! marsch...links! zwei, drei, vier!}
<A>__{we settle on young michael in line he passes gunther. he remains eager. but it is goodbye. these soldiers moving into the darkness and towards death. gunther looks on tears in his eyes. the two horses are uneasy sensing tension. a few minutes later gunther grabs a saddle and throws it onto joey's back. back to the soldiers. suddenly we see the galloping legs of two horses. they whip past the back of the line of marching soldiers. it's clear what is happening gunther is on topthorn and has hold of joey, on a loose rope, galloping beside him. gunther, galloping along the line of soldiers, spots what he is looking for, a red pennant unfurled and flapping in the wind, tied onto michael's pack. gunther speeds toward him. this was his plan all along. and in an instant he is beside him and without michael ever realizing, he suddenly finds his arms and legs akimbo, as he is yanked out of the line and dragged along the ground, desperately close to joey's pounding hooves. michael looks at the soldiers beside him he looks at the skyline of violence ahead...but before he can decide, he feels his brother's arm pulling him upwards. and now, the two of them are fully on topthorn. they leave a jumble of soldiers in their wake as the officers try to restore order.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{get back in line! line!}
