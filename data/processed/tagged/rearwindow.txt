<L>__{interior jefferies' apartment day long shot}
<A>__{although we do not see the foreground window frame, we see the whole background of a greenwich village street. we can see the rear of a number of assorted houses and small apartment buildings whose fronts face on the next cross town street, sharply etched by the morning sun. some are two stories high; others three; some have peaked roofs, others are flat. there is a mixture of brick and wood and wrought iron in the construction. the apartment buildings have fire escapes, the others do not. the neighborhood is not a prosperous one, but neither is it poor. it is a practical, conventional dwelling place for people living on marginal incomes, luck or hope and careful planning. the summer air is motionless and heavy with humid heat. it has opened windows wide, pushed back curtains, lifted blinds and generally brought the neighborhood life into a sweltering intimacy. yet, people born and bred to life within earshot and eye glance of a score of neighbors have learned to preserve their own private worlds by uniformly ignoring each other, except on direct invitation. the camera pulls back until a large sleeping profile of a man fills the screen. it is so large that we do not see any features, but merely the temple and side of the cheek down which a stream of sweat is running. the camera pans off this to the right hand side of the window, and moves to a thermometer which is hanging on the wall just outside the window. it registers 84. the camera moves on into the open, and brings nearer to us a room with a large studio window. we are able to see inside this room. a short, balding man is standing near the window, shaving, using a small bowl of water and a portable mirror which he has set up on a shelf. to the right of him is a battered upright piano. on top of the piano is a radio. the music selection coming from the radio stops, and the announcer is heard.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{the time 7:15 a.m., wor, new york. the temperature, outside, 84 friends is your life worth one dollar?}
<A>__{the man shaving quickly puts down his razor, hurries to the radio, and changes the station, moving past a number of commercial voices until he again finds some music. contented, he returns to his shaving. the camera moves on and over to a far building. it passes over the face of this building until it comes to fire escapes. it goes up and near enough to one which has become the outdoor bedroom of a couple. we are near enough to see an alarm clock hanging from the rail which is now ringing vigorously. a man rises lazily to a sitting position. he gropes to switch the alarm off. we see that his pajamas are stained with sweat. in his sitting position he leans forward and shakes somebody beside him. to our surprise, the head of this other person a woman rises where his feet are. they have been sleeping in opposite directions. they sit limply looking at each other with bedraggled and weary expressions which show they enjoyed very little sleep in the heat of the night. the camera now moves down toward the left onto another low building. it moves in a little to a living room window. just inside the windowsill, a small fan is oscillating. the fan sits on the right side of the table, and to the left of it is an automatic toaster. behind the toaster stands a full bodied young woman, apparently wearing only a pair of black panties. her stomach, navel, and the lower part of her chest are naked. just below her breasts, the curtain, partly drawn, has thrown a deep shadow which extends upward, hiding her breasts, shoulders and head. two pieces of toast pop up in the toaster. she takes them out, butters them. then she turns around and bends over another table on which stands an automatic coffee maker. she picks up the coffee maker, and swings back to the table to sit down. she does this so deftly that her breasts are never exposed, but hidden by the fan as she sits down. the fan moves back and forth as she pours coffee, far enough to reveal that she wears no bra, but not far enough to fulfill the exciting promise of her lack of clothes. the camera moves on to a distant street corner seen between two buildings. the traffic is very light at this hour, but a sanitation department truck moves through the intersection spraying water out behind it to cool the pavement and keep the dust down. three little kids in bathing suits run behind the truck, playing in the water. the camera moves off and around to some buildings at the side. as it skims this building, we see a hand emerge from one of the windows, and remove the cover from a birdcage which is hanging from a hook on the wall outside. in the cage are two lovebirds arguing. the camera now pulls back swiftly and retreats through the open window back into jefferies' apartment. we now see more of the sleeping man. the camera goes in far enough to show a head and shoulders of him. he is l. b. jefferies. a tall, lean, energetic thirty five, his face long and serious looking at rest, is in other circumstances capable of humor, passion, naive wonder and the kind of intensity that bespeaks inner convictions of moral strength and basic honesty. he is sitting in an everest and jennings wheelchair. the camera pans along his right leg. it is encased in a plaster of paris spica from his waistline to the base of his toes. along the white cast someone has written "here lie the broken bones of l. b. jefferies." the camera pans to a nearby table on which rests a shattered and twisted speed graphic camera, the kind used by fast action news photographers. on the same table, the camera pans to an eight by ten glossy photo printerior it shows a dirt track auto racing speedway, taken from a point dangerously near the center of the track. a racing car is skidding toward the camera, out of control, spewing a cloud of dust behind it. a rear wheel has come off the car, and the wheel is bounding at top speed directly into the camera lens. the camera moves up to a framed photograph on the wall. it is a fourteen by ten print, an essay in violence, having caught on film the exploding semi second when a heavy artillery shell arches into a front line korean battle outpost. men and equipment erupt into the air suspended in a solution of blasted rock, dust and screeching shrapnel. that the photographer was not a casualty is evident, but surprising when the short distance between the camera and the explosion is estimated. a signature in the lower right hand corner of the picture reads "l. b. jefferies." the camera pans to a second photograph of a picket line at an aircraft plant strike. strikers, non strikers and police are embroiled in a bitter and confused riot. clubs, fists and truncheons swing, blood flows, faces twist with emotion and fallen victims struggle to regain their feet. the picture represents no distant, cautions photographic observation, but rather an intimate report, so immediate and real that the viewer has the nervous feeling the fight surrounds him and he had best defend himself. the same signature, "l. b. jefferies," is in the corner. the camera pans to another framed picture, this one a beautiful and awesome shot of an atomic explosion at frenchman's flat, nevada. it is the cul de sac of violence. the picture taken at a distant observation point, shows some spectators in the foreground watching the explosion through binoculars. the camera moves on to a shelf containing a number of cameras, photographic film, etc. it then pan across a large viewer on which is resting a negative of a woman's head. from this, the camera moves on to a magazine cover, and although we do not see the name of the magazine, we can see the head on the cover is the positive of the negative we have just passed. the camera finally comes to rest on a pile of magazines perhaps a hundred or so. they are all of the same publication.}

<L>__{interior gunnison's office day close up}
<A>__{the screen is filled with the top of a desk. in addition to the usual telephones, blotting pad, etc., the most prominent feature is the number of glossy photo prints, and even larger sized mat prints. some of them have slips pasted over with descriptions. the center of the desk is occupied by a large layout of photographs on one magazine page. behind this we hear the murmur of two voices of men who can be vaguely seen beyond the desk. the camera pans up and we are now face to face with ivar gunnison and jack bryce. gunnison is sitting on a window ledge, and beyond him we realize we are high above the new york streets. bryce leans against a wall at right angles to him. gunnison is holding a cablegram in his hand. bryce has a cigarette in his mouth. he scratches a match, and is about to light it, when he notices that gunnison, still reading the cable, has reached into an inside shirt pocket, and produced a cigarette. quickly, bryce moves over to light gunnison's cigarette. then he settles back to light his own. gunnison doesn't even bother to thank him.}
<C>__{gunnison}
<P>__{(looks up)}
<D>__{indo china jeff predicted it would go sky high.}
<C>__{bryce}
<D>__{from the looks of davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. and we haven't even got a camera over there.}
<C>__{gunnison}
<P>__{(stands)}
<D>__{this could go off in a month or an hour.}
<C>__{bryce}
<D>__{i will pull somebody out of japan.}
<C>__{gunnison}
<P>__{(heads for his phone)}
<D>__{bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.}
<P>__{(picks up phone)}
<D>__{get me l. b. jefferies.}
<C>__{bryce}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{jefferies?}
<C>__{gunnison}
<P>__{(to bryce; still holding phone)}
<D>__{name me a better photographer.}
<C>__{bryce}
<P>__{(he can't)}
<D>__{but his leg!}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{don't worry it comes off today.}
<A>__{bryce gives gunnison a startled look.}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{i mean the cast.}
<P>__{(to phone)}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day semi closeup}
<A>__{shooting through the open window, onto jeff. he is shaving himself with an electric razor as the phone rings. he shuts off the shaver, picks up the phone.}

<P>__{(on filter)}
<D>__{congratulations, jeff.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{for getting rid of that cast.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{who said i was getting rid of it?}
<A>__{at this moment, his attention is drawn to something across the way. he looks up, expectantly. there is almost a touch of eagerness in his expression.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood day long shot}
<A>__{while jeff is continuing his phone conversation, we see the object of his look. two pretty girls have appeared on the distant roof. they are smiling and talking, although we cannot hear their dialogue. each wears a terrycloth robe. with their backs to the camera, they take off the robes, slipping them down over their shoulders slowly. then, seductively, they turn revealing the full beauty of their tanned and bathing suited bodies. it is almost as if they want to be noticed, the center of neighborhood attention. they at least have all of jeff's attention. then they spread the robes in front of them, and lie down on the roof, and out of sight. jeff seems a little disappointed.}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day semi closeup}
<A>__{during the whole of this previous action, the conversation between jeff and gunnison has gone on as follows:}
<C>__{gunnison}
<P>__{(with logical proof)}
<D>__{this is wednesday.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{gunnison how did you get to be such a big editor with such a small memory?}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{wrong day?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{wrong week. next wednesday i emerge from this plaster cocoon.}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{that's too bad, jeff. well, i guess i can't be lucky every day. forget i called.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{yeah. i sure feel sorry for you, gunnison. must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.}
<L>__{interior gunnison's office day semi closeup}
<A>__{gunnison is now seated at his desk, with the phone receiver to his ear. his assistant, bryce, can be seen vaguely in the background.}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{that one week is going to cost me my best photographer and you a big assignment.}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day close up}
<A>__{jeff asks, eagerly and alertly.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{we hear gunnison's reply.}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{there's no point in even talking about it.}
<A>__{jeff's eyes become set upon something else in the neighborhood he sees.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood day long shot}
<A>__{jeff's attention is now drawn to another feature of his backyard entertainment. the camera is now focused on the window of the small building where we earlier saw the girl behind the oscillating fan. loud ballet music is pouring from her open window. the girl, now dressed in dark and revealing leotard, and ballet slippers, has just turned away from a portable record player. she begins the first graceful movement of a modern ballet interpretation. she gracefully moves across the room to the rhythm of the music and dance, toward the ice box. with her feet still moving, she throws open the door, and then rhythmically moving back to the center of the room, gnaws the chicken bone, occasionally waving it in the air as part of the choreography. she now twirls over toward a table at the other side of the room on which is an open package of bread slices, some butter nearby. with swaying body, she puts down the chicken leg, and gracefully and rhythmically butters a slice of bread. she picks up both bread and chicken leg and continues her interpretive dance, alternately munching the bread and butter and chicken leg.}
<L>__{interior apartment day closeup}
<A>__{jeff's eyes drop from the ballet dancer's room to the one underneath.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood day long shot}
<A>__{the camera pans from the window of the dancing girl, to the window below. someone is reading the new york herald tribune. the paper lowers, and we see an elderly lady, in her late sixties. she is a faded, refined type. she looks up in the direction of the music and in a calm routine fashion adjusts the volume of her hearing aid. she resumes her reading.}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day closeup}
<A>__{jeff is amused by what he sees, but continues his conversation with gunnison, which has gone on through all the scenes with the ballet dancer.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(insistent)}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{gunnison}
<P>__{(filter)}
<D>__{indo china. got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. the place is about to go up in smoke.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(pleased; excited)}
<D>__{didn't i tell you! didn't i tell you it was the next place to watch?}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{you did.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(on filter)}
<D>__{okay. when do i leave? half hour? an hour?}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{with that cast on you don't.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(on filter)}
<D>__{stop sounding stuffy. i will take pictures from a jeep. from a water buffalo if necessary.}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{you're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. i will send morgan or lambert.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{swell. i get myself half killed for you and you reward me by stealing my assignments.}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{i didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(a little angry)}
<D>__{you asked for something dramatically different! you got it!}
<C>__{gunnison}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{so did you. goodbye, jeff.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(won't let him hang up)}
<D>__{you've got to get me out of here! six weeks sitting in a two room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!}
<A>__{at this moment we hear the sounds of a piano playing. it is a simple, but broken, melody as if someone was just learning to play the piano, or carefully composing a song. it clashes abruptly with the music from the ballet dancer's apartment. it irritates jeff as he looks in the direction of the new music.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{it's worse than the chinese water torture.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood day semi long shot}
<A>__{we now see the source of the piano music. it comes from the apartment with the studio window which we saw earlier where the man was shaving and listening to the radio. the short, balding man sits at the piano playing a few notes, then transferring them by pencil to notepaper on the piano rack. he continues this process, fighting the interference of the ballet music. the opening bars of his melody are beautiful and ear catching. it is slow, hard work, and the ballet music finally becomes such an interference that he gives up and walks to the window to look down toward the dancer's apartment. he stands by a table at the window which is littered with records, the morning coffee cup, unwashed, the remains of breakfast, old newspapers, song sheets, etc. he takes a cigarette out of his mouth, looks for an ash tray, and ends up putting it out in the coffee cup. he then returns to the piano and begins picking out the melody the dancer is playing on her record player.}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day semi closeup}
<A>__{jeff frowns at the double sound, and raises his voice a little. he continues the conversation which has been heard all through the previous scene.}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{read some good books.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i've been taking pictures so long i don't know how to read anymore.}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{i will send you some comic books.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(low, tense)}
<D>__{listen if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom i will do something drastic.}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(on filter)}
<D>__{i will i will get married. then i will never be able to go anywhere.}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{it's about time you got married before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{can you see me rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{jeff wives don't nag anymore they discuss.}
<A>__{jefferies glances out across to the other apartments as he sees:}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood day semi long shot}
<A>__{we see a three storied, flat roofed apartment house. the brick is weather worn and faded. each apartment has three windows facing the back, one showing a hallway, one a living room, and the window on the right opening into a bedroom. on the second floor, a man has entered the living room from a hallway door. he carries a large aluminum sample case common to salesmen. he sets down the case heavily, removes his hat, and slowly wipes his brow with the back of his right hand. he takes off his coat and tie. his shirt is stained with sweat underneath. he rolls up his sleeves, and his well muscled arms heavy with hair confirm his dark, husky build.}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day semi closeup}
<A>__{with his eyes still focused on the distant apartments, jeff continues talking with gunnison.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{yeah? maybe in the high rent districts they discuss but in my neighborhood, they still nag.}
<C>__{gunnison}
<D>__{well you know best. call you later, jeff.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{next time, have some good news.}
<A>__{he hangs up and resumes his attention on the apartment of the salesman.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood day semi long shot}
<A>__{the salesman looks toward the bedroom door, hesitates, then reluctantly walks toward it. for a moment he is hidden by the wall.}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day closeup}
<A>__{jeff shifts his look more to the right.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood day semi long shot}
<A>__{the man enters the bedroom. we can see a woman lying on the far bed. near her, a small table is covered with medicine bottles, spoons, boxes of pills, a water pitcher and the other impedimenta of the chronically ill. the woman sits up as the man enters. she takes a wet cloth off her forehead. before the man even reaches her, she begins talking, somewhat vigorously. pointing to a wristwatch, she seems to be saying something such as "you should have been home two hours ago! i could be lying here dying for all you'd know or care!" the man stops short of the bed, makes gestures of trying to placate her, but she goes on scolding. his attitude changes to weary patience, then irritation, then anger. he shouts back at her, turns and goes out of the room. back in the living room, he picks up his hat, throws it against the wall in anger, and leaves the apartment, slamming the door behind him.}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day medium shot}
<A>__{jeff's attention is suddenly diverted to himself. his leg, under the cast, begins itching. he squirms, tries to move the leg a little. it gives no relief. he scratches the outside of the cast, but the itch gets worse. he reaches for a long, chinese back scratcher lying on the windowsill. carefully, and with considerable ingenuity, he works it under the cast. he scratches, and a look of sublime relief comes over his face. satisfied, he takes the scratcher out. as he replaces it on the windowsill, his attention is drawn back to the scene outside the window.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood day semi long shot}
<A>__{we see the man who left his apartment in anger come out of the doorway into the backyard. he is easy to identify through the color of his garish necktie. in one hand the man carries a small garden hoe and rake, and in the other a pair of trimming shears. he goes to a small patch of flowers, perhaps three feet square. they are beautiful, multi colored three foot high zinnias. he kneels down, inspects them, touches them affectionately and with some pride. his anger seems to have left him, replaced by the kind of peace that flowers bring many people. he stands up, carefully hoes the ground, them rakes it. then he snips a few leaves off the lower parts of the plant. finally, he waters them.}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day semi closeup}
<A>__{jeff's attention is turned to something else of interest.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood day semi long shot}
<A>__{into the next door yard we see emerging from the apartment below the ballet dancer, the elderly lady. she wear a broad sun hat, dark glasses, and a sunsuit consisting of pink shorts and halter. she carries a copy of the herald tribune, and still wears her hearing aid. she settles into a folding, canvas deck chair. her skin is dead white, and her body is thin to the point of emaciation. no sooner has she settled into her chair, than she is attracted by the sound of the salesman working in his garden. she gets up, walks to the fence, and looks over. he notices her, but doesn't speak. she begins gesturing to him how to take care of his flowers. he listens for a moment, then looks directly at her. the strong movements of his mouth show us that he objects vigorously to the annoyance of her comments. she moves away from the fence, started and a little shocked.}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day medium shot}
<A>__{jeff is seated in the foreground, in a waist shot. behind him, the entrance door to his apartment opens. stella mcgaffery comes in. she is a husky, unhandsome, dark haired woman who is dressed like a district nurse, with dark coat, dark felt hat, with a white uniform showing underneath the coat. she carries a small black bag. stella pauses on the landing to watch jeff. he doesn't appear to notice her entrance.}
<C>__{stella}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{the new york state sentence for a peeping tom is six months in the workhouse!}
<A>__{he doesn't turn.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{hello stella.}
<A>__{as she comes down the stairs of the landing, holding on the wrought iron railing with one hand:}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{and there aren't any windows in the workhouse.}
<A>__{she puts her bag down on a table. it is worn, and looks as if it belongs more to a fighter than a nurse. she takes off her hat coat, and hangs them on a chair.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{years ago, they used to put out your eyes with a hot poker. is one of those bikini bombshells you always watch worth a hot poker?}
<A>__{he doesn't answer. she opens the bag, takes out some medical supplies: a thermometer, a stop watch, a bottle of rubbing oil, a can of powder, a towel. she talks as she works.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{we've grown to be a race of peeping toms. what people should do is stand outside their own houses and look in once in a while.}
<P>__{(she looks up at him)}
<D>__{what do you think of that for homespun philosophy?}
<A>__{a look at his face shows he doesn't think much of it.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{readers' digest, april, 1939.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{well, i only quote from the best.}
<A>__{she takes the thermometer out of its case, shakes it down. looks at it. satisfied, she walks to jeff. she swings the wheelchair around abruptly to face her.}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day medium shot}

<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{now look, stella }
<A>__{she shoves the thermometer into his mouth.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{see it you can break a hundred.}
<A>__{as she leaves him holding the thermometer the camera pulls back as she crosses to a divan. she takes a sheet from underneath, and covers the divan with it. talking, all the time.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{i shoulda been a gypsy fortune teller, instead of an insurance company nurse. i got a nose for trouble can smell it ten miles away.}
<P>__{(stops, looks at him)}
<D>__{you heard of the stock market crash in '29?}
<A>__{jeff nods a bored "yes."}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{i predicted it.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(around thermometer)}
<D>__{how?}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day semi closeup}
<A>__{stella stops for a moment, and looks at jeff challengingly.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{simple. i was nursing a director of general motors. kidney ailment they said. nerves, i said. then i asked myself what's general motors got to be nervous about?}
<P>__{(snaps her fingers)}
<D>__{overproduction. collapse, i answered. when general motors has to go to the bathroom ten times a day the whole country's ready to let go.}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day closeup}
<A>__{a patient, suffering look comes over his face. he takes out the thermometer.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{stella in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. absolutely none.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{it crashed, didn't it?}
<A>__{jeff has no answer. defeated, he puts the thermometer back into his mouth.}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day closeup}
<A>__{stella goes on with her work.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{i can smell trouble right in this apartment. you broke your leg. you look out the window. you see things you shouldn't. trouble. i can see you now, in front of the judge, flanked by lawyers in blue double breasted suits. you're pleading, "judge, it was only innocent fun. i love my neighbors like a father." the judge answers, "congratulations. you just gave birth to three years in dannemora."}
<A>__{the camera pans her over to him. she takes out the thermometer, looks at it.}

<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{you've got a hormone deficiency.}

<D>__{how can you tell that from a thermometer!}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{those sultry sun worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.}
<A>__{she gets down the thermometer. sterilizes it with a piece of alcohol soaked cotton in her other hand. she gets behind the wheelchair the camera pulls back as she pushes it over to the divan. she puts the thermometer away in its case. then she helps him off with his pajama top. she helps him stand on one foot. he hops one step, then she lowers him, face down, on the divan. she gets a bottle of rubbing oil.}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day close shot}
<A>__{the camera is very low at one end of the divan. jeff's head, half buried in the sheet, is large in the fore ground. beyond him stella looms large and powerful looking.}

<D>__{maybe he's leaving his wife. i don't know, and i don't care. lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts but very, very, very few of them end up in murder if that's what you're thinking.}

<C>__{lisa}

<A>__{only the slightest sound is heard as the doorknob turns. the door slowly and carefully swings open, but the corridor is too dark to tell at first who is entering. the door closes just as quietly. from the shadowed recess comes a heavy voice. a threatening voice.}

<D>__{what do you want from me?}
<A>__{jeff doesn't answer. thorwald steps to the top of the stairs, and is now somewhat visible. he looks tall and huge and explosive.}
