<A>__{the doors slam on a vatican police car and the tires squeal as olivetti hits the gas.}
<L>__{int car day}
<A>__{olivetti is behind the wheel, vittoria's in front, langdon leans in from the back seat.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{twenty minutes till eight, where are we headed?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{i will know in a minute, give me the paper.}
<A>__{vittoria pulls the page from the diagramma out of her pocket and hands it to langdon. he pulls the magnifier from his coat and studies the thin paper, turning it in his hands.}
<C>__{langdon }
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{from santi's earthly tomb with demon's hole...}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{where did you get that paper?!}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{'cross rome the mystic elements unfold.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{we borrowed it.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{the path of light is laid, the sacred test...}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{are you insane?!}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{let angels guide you on your earthly quest.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{you removed a document from the vatican archives?!}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{huh? oh, um well, she moved so fast..}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{the first marker sounds like it's at santi's tomb.}
<C>__{langdon}
<P>__{(musing)}
<D>__{sounds like.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{but who is santi?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{raphael.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{raphael? the sculptor?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{santi was his last name.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{so the path starts at raphael's tomb!}
<C>__{langdon}
<P>__{(not entirely convinced)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{raphael is buried at the pantheon.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{is the pantheon even a church?}
<C>__{olivetti}
<P>__{(snatching up the radio)}
<D>__{oldest catholic church in rome!}
<A>__{langdon has fallen silent, but it all makes perfect sense, so he says nothing as olivetti cranks the wheel hard }
