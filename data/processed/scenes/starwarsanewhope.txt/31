<A>__{luke's aunt beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well used kitchen. she puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls of food and starts for the dining area. luke sits with his uncle owen before a table covered with steaming bowls of food as aunt beru carries in a bowl of red grain.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you know, i think that r2 unit we bought might have been stolen.}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{what makes you think that?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, i stumbled across a recording while i was cleaning him. he says he belongs to someone called obi wan kenobi.}
<A>__{owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but manages to control himself.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i thought he might have meant old ben. do you know what he's talking about? well, i wonder if he's related to ben.}
<A>__{owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{that old man's just a crazy old wizard. tomorrow i want you to take that r2 unit into anchorhead and have its memory flushed. that'll be the end of it. it belongs to us now.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but what if this obi wan comes looking for him?}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{he won't, i don't think he exists any more. he died about the same time as your father.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{he knew my father?}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{i told you to forget it. your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. in the morning i want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yes, sir. i think those new droids are going to work out fine. in fact, i, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. and if these new droids do work out, i want to transmit my application to the academy this year.}
<A>__{owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress it.}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{you mean the next semester before harvest?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{sure, there're more than enough droids.}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{harvest is when i need you the most. only one more season. this year we'll make enough on the harvest so i will be able to hire some more hands. and then you can go to the academy next year.}
<A>__{luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{you must understand i need you here, luke.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but it's a whole 'nother year.}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{look, it's only one more season.}
<A>__{luke pushes his half eaten plate of food aside and stands.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah, that's what you said last year when biggs and tank left.}
<C>__{aunt beru}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it looks like i'm going nowhere. i have to finish cleaning those droids.}
<A>__{resigned to his fate, luke paddles out of the room. owen mechanically finishes his dinner.}
<C>__{aunt beru}
<D>__{owen, he can't stay here forever. most of his friends have gone. it means so much to him.}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{i will make it up to him next year. i promise.}
<C>__{aunt beru}
<D>__{luke's just not a farmer, owen. he has too much of his father in him.}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{that's what i'm afraid of.}
