<L>__{interior exterior bodhi's house}
<A>__{tyler leads utah through the steady flow of surf rats and other pch nomads toward a large outdoor deck where a barbecue is in progress. moonlit waves pound the shore eighty feet below. they are immediately distracted by the small crowd gathering around grommet who has his nose pressed flat against the center of a dart board. his eyes swivels back to roach, standing fifteen feet away, dart in hand, getting ready to throw.}
<C>__{grommet}
<D>__{do your worst, man!}
<A>__{roach drains a beer in one gulp, spies the sharp needle point of the dart, then squints at the target. rosie moves through the small crowd collecting bets. suddenly roaches arm snaps back. a collective hush... in a blur of tattoos the small feathered missile is airborne. twaaapppppp! bulls eye. centimeters from flesh. grommet secretly exhales. roach howls as rosie rains money on his head. the crowd goes wild. bodhi stands nearby with his arm around a beautiful woman. pleased to see utah, he motions him over.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{don't you gamble?}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{only make bets i can't afford to lose. only way to be 100% committed.}
<A>__{with that, bodhi smiles, then he and the woman vanish into the crowd. utah watches them go, turns to tyler.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{who's the girl?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{catch of the day.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{oh, oh. that sounds personal.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{people are expendable to bodhi.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{meaning you were expendable.}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{we went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them. but you can't hold it against him, he's... different.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{sure, he's "the bodhisattva".}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(she chuckles)}
<D>__{yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.}
<P>__{(thoughtful)}
<D>__{maybe he has. you've seen him surf... that frenzy. it seems like anger. it's not. it's the energy of lovemaking. the sea is the woman in his life. she's his only true lover.}
<A>__{utah studies her a moment. he's caught the faintest hint of regret in her voice. but also the straight ahead pragmatism. he looks down at the waves pounding mercilessly against the rocks.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{all she does is beat the shit out of me.}
