<A>__{kathleen turns the closed sign on the door over to read "open" and she activates the computer system. she looks around, and we see a small but charming children's bookstore, with wooden shelves, a tiny area where kids can sit and read, some charming posters and a glass case full of first editions of the oz books and alice in wonderland, etc. there's a playful display of witches, lit with twinkle lights covered with orange pumpkin globes and a sign reading "the ten best witch list" and a collection of witch books "the lion, the witch and the wardrobe," "the witches," "the wizard of oz." on the counter is a glass jar full of sugar free lollipops. kathleen hangs up her coat in the back of the store and suddenly stops to daydream. a smile creeps onto her face. christina looks at her.}

<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{forget it. we don't talk about anything personal. we made a rule about that. i don't know his name, what he does or exactly where he lives, so it will be really easy to stop seeing him, because i'm not.}
