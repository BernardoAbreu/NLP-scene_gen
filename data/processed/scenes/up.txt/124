<A>__{dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave. carl and russell run toward him. the cave leads to a steep incline. the dogs are getting closer. there's no choice but to jump. the lift from the overhead balloons allows carl and russell to leap down the incline, like astronauts.}

<A>__{dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on carl and russell. the bird sees the dogs. she jumps off the house and lifts carl and russell on her back. she runs through the cave, towing the house behind her. russell and carl hang on for dear life. bang bang bang! balloons pop as they scrape across the ceiling. the house lowers. ahead, a giant rock sits in their path. carl tugs at the house but it crashes against the rock, pulling russell onto the ground.}
