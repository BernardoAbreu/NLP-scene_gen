<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{gray screen}
<A>__{there is the sound of a car idling. george opens his eyes. above him is the carport and jill's yellow mustang has just pulled in. george rises. he walks into the living room as jill comes down the steps to the kitchen, carrying the paper. the kitchen clock reads 4:44. george glances at it. then back at jill. she looks at him, frightened but not moving. her hair is stringy and she's got no makeup on. there's a bruise on the inside of her upper arm and a small one on her neck, and one on her left thigh all of which george will note in the course of the scene. george looks her up and down.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i don't want to fight, george.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't want to fight either. look... uh i love you.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(moving to her, taking her arm)}
<D>__{i do, jill.}
<A>__{at this point he notes the arm bruise. jill stares back at him unflinching. george smiles.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{how come you took your own car?}
<C>__{jill}
<P>__{(getting a cigarette)}
<D>__{i didn't want him meeting me here.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well that's something.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{what is.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you didn't plan on fucking him tonight.}
<A>__{jill doesn't answer. she walks into the bedroom, kicks off her shoes, starts to take off her dress, then changes her mind and puts on a robe over it.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{you did fuck him, didn't you?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i'm very tired, george.}
<A>__{jill goes into the living room. george grabs her arm again.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{didn't you, baby?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{let go of me.}
<A>__{george doesn't.}
<C>__{jill }
<D>__{let go of me or i will scream, i will call the police.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, christ.}
<A>__{he lets go of her. the phone rings. jill answers it. her tone alters appreciably.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{oh, hi... listen, can i call you back?... yes... no, everything's fine, really... bye.}
<A>__{she hangs up.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that was him.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you told him i was here and he wanted to know if i was beating you up.}
<A>__{jill smiles thinly.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, did you get a job out of it at least?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i'd like you to leave now.}
<A>__{george doesn't move. jill goes over and fishes into a tote bag by the wall. she returns with felicia's missing earring.}
<C>__{jill }
<D>__{ and take this with you.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{where did this come from?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{who knows, i'm sure you don't but if it'll help any, i found it in your bed.}
<A>__{george nods. jill's anger is growing and her hurt is beginning to surface now. tears start welling in her eyes.}
<C>__{jill }
<P>__{(unsteadily)}
<D>__{so who else was there besides jackie? huh?... huh?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{baby, don't do this. i do love you.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{obviously there were others, weren't there?}
<A>__{george stares at jill. then:}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{obviously.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what do you wanna know for?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i just want to know, that's all.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what difference does it make?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i just want to know while we were seeing each other... i just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...}
<A>__{jill is crying a little now and looks very vulnerable. george moves to her and tries to put his arms around her.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{baby, please don't... i love you.}
<C>__{jill}
<P>__{(breaking away)}
<D>__{i don't want to be a fool!... i want to look them in the eye and say, i know!}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(she's backing up, he's trying to touch her)}
<D>__{baby, don't do this }
<C>__{jill}
<P>__{(fighting for control)}
<D>__{ it'll help me if you'll tell me.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ please, baby }
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{ no, it'll help me, really }
<C>__{george}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i will know you've lied to me... all along. i will know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.}
<A>__{it's been rising in him the last few exchanges. now all george's restraints seem to leave him. he stops trying to touch her and stands his ground, exploding:}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you dumb cunt, everybody fucks everybody, grow up, for christ's sakes. you're an antique, you know that? look around you all of 'em, all these chicks they're all fucking, they're getting their hair done so they can go and fuck, that's what it's all about. come into the shop tomorrow and i will show you i fucked her, and her, and her, and her, and her i fucked 'em all!... that's what i do, i fuck. that's why i went to beauty school, to fuck. i can't help that, they're there and i do their hair and sometimes i fuck 'em. i stick it in and i pull it out and that's a fuck, it's not a crime.}
<A>__{george leans on a glass topped coffee table for support, not even bothering to look at jill. jill has been pulled together a little more by the speech.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{... well i'm glad you told me.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(his eyes closed)}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{his tone has indicated disbelief and disgust.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i am... i mean, you know, that's...}
<A>__{she can't finish it.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what? what? what? what? what?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{... honest. at least you're honest with me.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{does it make you happy?}
<A>__{jill doesn't answer.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i wish you'd go now.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that's all you've got to say?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{ yes.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ tell me something did you talk about me?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{george...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{did you?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{please!... that's not like you.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yeah, i know. did you?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{george, now cut this out.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{did you?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{stop it.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{did you?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{yes, yes, i did.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{george, if you keep this up i'm going to scream.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{george...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i said you were a loser!}
<A>__{she starts to cry again. george smiles.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no, i'm not a loser, baby, i just sort of break even.}
<A>__{george turns and walks up the stairs and out the door.}
