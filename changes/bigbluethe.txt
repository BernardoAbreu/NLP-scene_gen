<LOC>__{EXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET}
<TRANS>__{CREDIT SEQUENCE:}
<ACTION>__{The image is in black and white. The sun disappears behind arid cliffs which cast giant shadows on the sea. A little boy around 8 years old -- tanned from head to toe -- sprints along the cliffs, scrambles from one rock to another with amazing agility. In one hand, he carries a transparent plastic bag.  In the other, a net bag containing flippers, mask, pants and sweater. The only thing that slows him down is his bathing suit -- obvious hand-me-downs -- way too big.  He tugs on them as he goes, holding them up... Until they slide again... as he leaps again... and pulls them up... The little boy is JACQUES MAYOL. End credits.}
<LOC>__{EXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET}
<ACTION>__{JACQUES reaches a ledge jutting out over a deserted cove. He spits in his mask... expertly spreads the spit with a finger... locks his feet into the flippers... and dives. He surfaces a long way out... adjusts his mask... and swims away from shore.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{IN OPEN SEA}
<ACTION>__{The boy stops swimming -- starts to gulp air -- sucks it in -- oxygenating his blood in a series of deep rapid breaths -- almost hyperventilating, almost alarming if we've never seen this before. His gaze is glued to the ocean floor.  Clear clear water.}
<LOC>__{40 feet deep.  And intensely blue.}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly, he catches his breath and dives -- into the blue.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{UNDERWATER}
<ACTION>__{JACQUES touches bottom.  Clamps his legs around a rock to hold himself down.  Unhurried, thoroughly at home, 40 feet under... he opens the plastic bag.  A huge speckled moray eel appears in a hole in the rock, slithers toward him. The carnivore's jaws are bigger than the boy's head. The boy smiles at him.  Pulls a piece of raw meat out of his bag and holds it out.  The eel takes the morsel delicately -- and slithers back into his hole. Gravely, JACQUES takes another morsel out of the bag.}

His father looks over at him without understanding.  The child quickly puts the coin back in his pocket.}

The gleaming copper helmet is the last thing to slide out of sight. JACQUES and LOUIS work the pump.  Regular, steady motions to maintain the flow of air.}

He is white as a sheet. JACQUES rushes to the side of the boat and starts yelling down at his father.  He grabs the life line and starts pulling at it hysterically.  The air hose snaps and starts flying around like some crazy snake.  JACQUES tries to jump overboard.  UNCLE LOUIS catches hold of his foot at the last second.  JACQUES is slapping the water with his hands, trying to go down but UNCLE LOUIS won't let him.  JACQUES is yelling desperately.  ENZO is now standing on his rock, watching the scene, horrified. The sea now looks as if it were boiling. UNCLE LOUIS grabs hold of JACQUES and hugs him in his arms.  Standing on his rock, ENZO is now crying desperately.}

The whole room watches him approach a long table where a large family is having a birthday party for a very old lady. He has to stop a second and catch his breath before he can get the words out.  Then leans over and whispers in the ear of a great big man -- around 30 -- built like a bull, wearing little round glasses. The man listens, then stiffens.}

Behind him the SUPERVISOR and other construction workers watch expectantly.  ROBERTO heaves a stone weight into the bay, a cable attached to it plays out from a drum on the pier. ENZO ignoring everyone, grabs the ordinary tire jack, flip-flops over to the now taut cable, the stone has hit bottom.  He takes a deep breath and dives into the bay. UNDERWATER - WRECK ENZO dives down a chimney of muck.  Picks his way over and around every hazard, until he reaches the diver, trapped under a huge piece of debris.
