<L>__{interior ennis page's house alexandria night}
<A>__{ennis page is a man unglued. he sits on a tidy little sofa, in a tidy 1950's style living room. but his movements have become untidy. he puts a very tiny pill on his tongue. when he drinks from a glass of water, it dribbles down his chin onto his shirt. not like ennis, at all. when his doorbell rings, he slowly looks up, then looks down at the floor again. he doesn't answer it. it rings some more. and then lisa is standing there before him}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{your identiscan is off, ennis. i could just walk in here.}
<C>__{page}
<D>__{i forgot. to turn it on.}
<A>__{she sits down beside him.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you don't look surprised to see me.}
<A>__{she glances at the bubble pack of pills on the table beside him, three gone.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{i need your help.}
<A>__{unexpectedly, tears well up in ennis's eyes.}
<C>__{page}
<D>__{he took one of my babies.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{he's desperate, ennis. he had to.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we have to help him.}
<A>__{lisa holds the precog disc in front of his eyes. he closes them against the sight, as if it were an evil talisman.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{it's a fake ennis.}
<A>__{ennis's eyes open again.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{this is the first disc. you delivered it to director anderson. he reviewed it. and then he stole it, and went on the run.}
<A>__{ennis tries to think through his fear and haze. his words slur.}
<C>__{page}
<D>__{i delivered ... a fake .. to him?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{but he thought it was real, and ran with it.}
<A>__{the pills, his tidy world coming apart ennis is losing it.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{an hour later, you delivered a second disc of the same event. witwer}
<P>__{reviewed it. it was real. (beat)}
<D>__{how do i know this?}
<A>__{ennis just wants her to go away. he wants it all to go away. tears stream down his face.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{director anderson had his eyes changed. they were blue. now he has brown ones.}
<A>__{ennis is sliding away. lisa takes hold of him. makes him listen, dammit. she points to the disc in her hand.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{this disc, the fake one, shows a blueeyed anderson murdering witwer two days from now. he doesn't have blue eyes anymore. the person who faked this disc had no idea he would change his eyes.}
<A>__{lisa shakes him.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{listen! but the second disc has to be real, because he has brown eyes when he murders witwer.}
<C>__{lisa }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{somebody tried to frame him with a fake. and somehow it all became real . why, ennis? how could this happen?}
<A>__{ennis gives her a look that's on the other side of comprehension.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{you handle the discs. how did a fake one get delivered?}
<A>__{ennis's eyes roll back into his head. page coffee ...}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{you want ?}
<C>__{page}
<D>__{he spilled coffee everywhere ... everywhere ...}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{what coffee? what are you ?}
<A>__{but ennis sags unconscious. she shakes him hard, even slaps him, but ennis is out. she lets him drop down on the sofa. from outside the house, somewhere high in the clouds, comes the whine of a hovercraft. lisa looks once more at ennis, then gets out of there}
