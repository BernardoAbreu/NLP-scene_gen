<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{he told you it was about eggs? the guy tried to break into my house. he tried to steal things from me.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{he was trying to find me. we had an argument.}

<C>__{nora}
<D>__{it's not for you to make decisions for me.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{i think maybe i should, because i think you're being misled... i think you're confused. i think...}

<P>__{(interrupting her)}
<D>__{but this guy is as bad a choice as you could make. bad choice.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{you're a good one to give advice... you're sitting on the steps, locked out of your house because you can't pay your taxes, and you're going to give me advice on life?}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{i'm not giving you a divorce, and that's it. i'm looking out for your welfare. no divorce.}

<P>__{(yelling to her)}
<D>__{it's for your own benefit, and you'll thank me for it.}
<A>__{nora turns toward tilley and suddenly snaps.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{my benefit! you don't give a damn about me! you don't give a damn who i marry. the reason you don't want me to marry is because he's the one taking your wife, and you've got your own problems with him.}
<C>__{nora }
<D>__{you don't care about me... it's the same bullshit you're doing. that's what it always is with you, tilley. it's always you! the i.r.s. took your house... your furniture! you don't say anything about my things in the house. i've got things in the house i worked damn hard for, and things that belonged to my family... the headboard that was given to me by aunt josephine, it's got to be at least a hundred years old... and the hand embroidered footstool...}

<D>__{what footstool?}
<C>__{nora}

<C>__{nora}
<D>__{you've never seen it!? you've never seen it!? you put your feet on it to watch tv... the hand embroidered footstool.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about. i never put my feet up to watch tv.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{that's the way you are, tilley, it doesn't mean anything to you. you don't care if they take it all away. it's all you, tilley! that's the way it's always been.}
<A>__{she stands there for a moment, then turns back to her car, gets in, slams the door and drives off. tilley stands on the front steps with a puzzled look on his face.}
