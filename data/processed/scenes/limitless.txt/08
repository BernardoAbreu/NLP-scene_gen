<A>__{we are in eddie's mind, in his pov, and we are seeing a lovely, willowy brunette, wearing an undershirt, bending seductively over him...}
<L>__{interior midtown coffee shop day}

<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{i have to get back.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{ hey, well wait you didn't tell me what happened yesterday.}
<A>__{we can see on lindy's face that she's still vulnerably pleased that eddie remembered to ask.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{i got it.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you got it ?!}
<C>__{lindy}

<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(genuine)}
<D>__{you deserve it, lindy.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{yeah, thanks. i do.}
<A>__{she smiles weakly, breaks eye contact. no good to keep looking. it's over. eddie makes an attempt to reach for the check, which lindy grabs.}
<C>__{lindy }
<D>__{oh, please.}
<A>__{he knows she knows he can't pay.}
