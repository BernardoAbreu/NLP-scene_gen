<L>__{exterior desert jim and megan's house very wide night}
<A>__{the headlights are two ironic beacons sending their beams skyward through the roiling dust into the night sky. the sound of the radio becomes muffled. the headlights sink from view and then megan's scream floats across the desert.}
<L>__{exterior pham van's store dawn}
<A>__{out front of pham van's, nervous val and earl saddle up the horses while pham loads their saddle bags with food. every one has gathered to see them off. there's an air of tension.}

<P>__{(eyeing the horses)}
<D>__{pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners. they better be fast.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{relax. a snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{screw you. for all you know they could fly .}
<A>__{earl pulls their old smith and wesson revolver and battered winchester rifle out of the pick up truck.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you want the rifle or the smith?}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(definite)}
<D>__{the rifle.}
<A>__{so does earl. he raises his hand. they swiftly do a round of scissors rock paper. earl loses. he hands val the rifle. just then, burt and heather pull up in their blazer, climbing out with their hunting rifles.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{you guys all set?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{ready as we'll ever be.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{heather and i are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{good idea. and we'll swing by the doctor's place. they were going to go into bixby but we don't know if they left before the road was out.}
<A>__{val and earl mount up.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{hold on. you guys oughta take something that packs more punch than that thirty thirty. take one of our browning autos, or even my model seventy...}

<A>__{earl takes the awesome looking gun with a smug glance at val.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{gee...thanks, heather. hope we don't need it.}
<A>__{heather unhooks a box of cartridges from her belt and hands it to earl. suddenly there's a blood curdling scream! the door to pham van's flies open. out staggers melvin, wrapped in pham van's hook tentacle, writhing in apparent agony.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{it's got me! it's got me! aaaahgh!}
<A>__{people scatter like sheep. burt and heather have guns trained on him in an instant. then everyone realizes it's a sick joke. melvin collapses with laughter. burt is livid. he almost shot melvin. he charges over and yanks the kid to his feet, screaming:}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{you stupid punk! you came that close, that close!!}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{one of these days, melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.}
<A>__{pham rushes over and grabs his precious tentacle. as people calm down, val and earl gaze nervously at the vast desert before them.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{well...you fellas watch yourselves.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{come back with the sheriff.}
<C>__{nestor}
<D>__{sheriff, like hell. come back with the national guard.}
