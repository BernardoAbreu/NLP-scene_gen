<A>__{the legend, "two years later" appears. a man flips open a worn file folder on his lap. handwritten notes fill every line. at the top of the first page reads, "vincent gray, age 10, referred january 19, 1989." the man's hand touches the name almost reverently. he glances through the page. words and phrases are circled throughout the file. "...acute anxiety" "...socially isolated" "...possible mood disorder" "...parent status divorced" "...communication difficulty between mother child dyad" the man's hands flip the page. at the top of this new page reads, "cole sear, age 8, referred september 1998." as the man's fingers move through the notes we again see words and phrases circled throughout this new case history. "...acute anxiety" "...socially isolated" "...possible mood disorder" "...parent status divorced" "...communication difficulty between mother child dyad" the hands close the notepad. the hands are slightly shaking now. we pull back to reveal the shaking hands belong to dr. malcolm crowe. malcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes across the street. he gazes blankly at the brownstones. beat. a door opens. malcolm is brought out of his trance. cole sear steps out his front door. cole is a munchkin of a boy with large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around him. his hair is dark, with a small patch of jet white on the side. cole carefully locks the door behind him. he moves to the bottom of the stairs and looks around nervously. anxiously. the eight year old child reaches into his pocket and slips on a pair of very large glasses. they look comical on him. malcolm rises to his feet. he smooths out his shirt. looks down and buttons his jacket. when he looks up, cole is gone. malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy. cole runs at full speed down the street and turns the corner. tiny sneakers}
