<A>__{d'artagnan keeps step with the cloaked figure, the retinue. he keeps his head down, glances at the corridor ahead, looking for a way out. but the cloaked figure is escorted up a long stairway, into another hall, and toward a pristine wooden door. d'artagnan watches as the door opens, revealing... cardinal richelieu, a fearsome apparition in red, the most powerful man in france. d'artagnan's jaw drops. the cloaked figure steps inside. the jailers disperse. d'artagnan takes steps as if to join them... then turns back, eyes the door, the cardinal and the cloaked figure now behind it.}
<B>__{angle to include interior}
<A>__{the cloaked figure bows to the cardinal. richelieu smiles, concupiscent. rochefort stands in a corner, ignored for the moment.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{i have an errand that requires your singular talents.}
<A>__{the figure rises. the hood falls back... revealing the unforgettable features of milady de winter. she answers the cardinal's smile with a seductive expression.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{i was beginning to think you'd forgotten me.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{forget you? impossible.}
<A>__{richelieu and milady share a look of intimacy, two vipers from the same pit.}

<D>__{you did it. an alliance with buckingham.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{the king left me no choice. now that he's come of age, the boy believes he should rule france. instead of me.}
<A>__{rochefort knows what this portends. he steps from the corner.}
<C>__{rochefort}

<P>__{(silences him with a glance)}
<D>__{yes. everything.}

<D>__{you're to leave for calais at once. a ship called the persephone will carry you to england. it sails tuesday, midnight. i want buckingham's signature next to mine before the king's birthday. friday.}

<A>__{richelieu's not talking about louis. he's talking about himself.}
