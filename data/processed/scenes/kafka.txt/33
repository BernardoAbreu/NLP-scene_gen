<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{the office evening kafka works at his desk, finger tapping at an adding machine. he checks the office clock nearly the end of the day.}
<B>__{the assistants}
<A>__{one is sweeping the floor. the other is scribbling at their desk. his pen blotches his paper. he has a fit and crumples it up and throws it down.}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{looks over at the chief clerk's office sees him writing intently at his desk, pausing to turn on a lamp.}
<B>__{the assistants}
<A>__{the sweeping one bangs his knee against a desk and starts hopping about. the pen of the other one leaks again. he crumples up his new sheet and flings it away even more angrily than before. then he examines his pen, determines that the cap at the back is loose, and starts banging it on his desk in an attempt to tighten it while the other assistant keeps jumping around holding his hurt kneecap.}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{glances over his shoulder at them, starts to say something but then notices burgel, not far away, sometimes blocked by other employees, walking in the direction of the chief clerk's office.}
<B>__{the assistants}
<A>__{the one assistant has just fixed his pen when the other one, still hopping around, bumps into him, causing him to knock over a bottle of ink. the two of them start shoving each other about. kafka whirls around, can't ignore them any longer.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{do you mind!}
<A>__{the assistants look at him, surprised at this outburst.}
<C>__{oskar}
<D>__{ i was just trying to finish some work!}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{you mean you've actually begun some?}
<C>__{ludwig}
<P>__{(pointing at oskar)}
<D>__{ just because he's done nothing today, he doesn't want me to show him up!}
<A>__{oskar tries to lunge at ludwig, but kafka holds him back.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{my assistants! you might as well have fallen from the sky for all the thought that was spent in choosing you!}
<A>__{the assistants look at each other sheepishly. then smile at kafka, submissively or mockingly, it's hard to tell.}
<C>__{oskar}
<D>__{it's not our fault. we're naturally nervous.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<D>__{and we're upset too.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{what's the matter with you?}
<C>__{oskar}
<D>__{i can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{ you should meet my father.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<D>__{we've been together too long. his personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.}
<C>__{oskar}
<D>__{ how would you like to be in a horrible situation like that?}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{he wouldn't. it's the nightmare of his life. but now he's distracted again noticing burgel walking away from the chief clerk's office (without ever having seem him actually enter it). and burgel is carrying a parcel under his arm.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(to assistants again)}
<D>__{all right, you might as well go home go on.}
<A>__{the assistants do as they're told, oskar returning to his desk to clear up, turning his back on ludwig at which ludwig immediately rushes up very close behind him and shakes his fist strenuously at him, turning away quickly when oskar turns around again to try and catch ludwig at it. kafka isn't paying them any attention anymore. he efficiently cleans up his own space, keeping an eye on the chief clerk's office. when the office bell rings the chief clerk immediately turns off his desk lamp, puts on his overcoat, and shuts his office light on his way out. kafka doesn't think twice. he forces himself to start walking to the chief clerk's office. other departing office employees crisscross past him, but he walks in a straight line, businesslike, toward the chief clerk's office. he has a piece of paper in his hand. he enters the chief clerk's office, holds the paper out to drop on the chief clerk's desk but lets it slip off onto the floor. when he bends to retrieve it he quickly opens that bottom drawer where eduard's file was but it's now empty.}
