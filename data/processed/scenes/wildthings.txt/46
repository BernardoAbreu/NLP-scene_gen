<A>__{george looks stiff, maybe a little nervous. sam picks up on it. he scans the room...}
<B>__{angle on room}
<A>__{dimly lit, crowded, but we pick out barbara, stunning in a delicate white sun dress, tanned arms resting upon a table. sam starts toward her. george reaches out to touch his arm.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{mr. lombardo.}
<A>__{sam ignores him, threading his way among the people at a lavish bar, then stopping short as he sees who barbara is with her father, tom baxter. tom baxter sees sam, gets to his feet.}
<C>__{baxter}
<D>__{this is not appropriate lombardo.}
<A>__{sam steps to one side, makes eye contact with barbara. barbara has tears in her eyes. she looks at sam, then shakes her head, looking away.}

<P>__{(as sam faces him)}
<D>__{i ever see you around my daughter, you're going to be finished, period.}
<A>__{the two men square off, but already we can see georgie, trailed by a pair of beefy characters in blue blazers making their way across the room. sam sees them too. he takes a final look at barbara. when she refuses to meet his eye, he pushes past baxter, through the crowd and out of the restaurant.}
