<L>__{interior weinstock's apartment night}
<A>__{close shot of chemist with a small lab layout spread in front of him burner, test tubes, etc. the man's wearing an ordinary business suit and both the table and the background indicate that this is not a lab, but somebody's library or den and a fashionable one, with photos, a signed picture of lyndon johnson, etc., on the panelled walls. the chemist is running a thiele test on a small mound of powder. heroin from charnier's shipment. medium close shot of joel weinstock and sal boca sitting opposite the chemist. sal has a glass of beer in front of him, weinstock a brandy snifter containing a splash of amber cognac. both are interested; sal quite nervously. the chemist immerses a capillary tube, a tiny instrument the size of a needle into an open kilo of heroin. he pours a small quantity of mineral oil into a burnmeister test tube and preheats the oil over the open flame of a tiny alcohol lamp. he removes a 15 in thermometer from its leather case, fastens the capillary tuve (now totally immersed in the heroin) to the bulb of the thermometer with a rubber band. he places the bulb, with capillary attached, into an open rubber stop and inserts the entire apparatus into the burnmeister tube, about three inches in. with a small metal clamp he holds the rig over the lamp. we watch closely with the chemist, weinstock and boca as the white heroin powder slowly, agonizingly dissolves into the mineral oil and the mercury rises slowly up the thermometer to 220 230. the faces of the three men are filled with wonder and anxiety. as the mercury continues to rise they become a cheering section, rooting the hometeam home. the longer it takes for the powder to dissolve, the purer the heroin. the mercury stops at 240!}
