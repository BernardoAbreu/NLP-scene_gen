<L>__{interior house of erebus, meeting room night}
<A>__{close on a monitor featuring footage taken at the vampire club massacre. blade turns and stares into the camera, fires his cross bow. the screen cuts to static. a withered, clawed hand moves into frame, holding a remote. with a tap of a button, the monitor goes dark. pull back to reveal a large, minimalist conference room the house of erebus, seat of the vampire race's legislative assembly. gathered around a massive table are the twelve vampire elders, representing a "rainbow" of racial colors names like pallintine, von esper, ashe, bava. two of them, the faustinas, are identical twins lethal looking women with alabaster skin. chilled carafes filled with blood are situated along the table. from time to time, a member will pour themselves a glass, or perhaps, help themselves to the bowls of human finger bones which serve as snacks. at the head of the table is gaetano dragonetti, current vampire "overlord". blood red eyes, parchment skin stretched over skull like features. incalculably ancient, but still deadly and virile as a viper. dragonetti speaks. he uses the "secret tongue" the ancient vampire language which utilizes consonants human vocal chords are incapable of reproducing.}

<P>__{(subtitled)}
<D>__{blade. once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. he must be destroyed.}
<C>__{frost }
<P>__{(in english)}
<D>__{you're wrong, dragonetti.}
<A>__{all heads turn. who would dare such impudence? deacon frost, a mere "underlord" in the vampire hierarchy, steps forward. strikingly handsome, younger, less conservative than his superiors, fueled with a passionate intensity. amongst the vampire community he's known as an agitator. he's also the vampire equivalent of a racial supremacist.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{the day walker represents a unique opportunity. we'd be fools to waste it by killing him.}
<C>__{dragonetti}
<P>__{(subtitled, taking umbrage)}
<D>__{deacon frost. you refuse to speak our language, you insult the house of erebus by using the humans' gutter tongue, have you no respect for tradition?}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{why should i respect something which has outlived its purpose?}
<A>__{this causes quite a stir amongst the other vampires. frost might as well have slapped dragonetti in the face.}
<C>__{dragonetti}
<P>__{(simmering)}
<D>__{i see. and what would you have us do with this "half breed"?}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{study him. unlock the secrets of his dna. he's the key we've been looking for.}
<C>__{dragonetti}
<D>__{he is an abomination!}
<A>__{dragonetti slams his fist down, toppling a carafe, spilling blood across the tabletop. frost looks to the others }
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{why should we spend our lives cringing from the daylight when his blood offers us an alternative? enough talk. it's time we stepped out of the shadows!}
<A>__{dragonetti looks apoplectic. elder pallintine, a five hundred year old vampire inhabiting the body of a prepubescent boy, interjects.}
<C>__{pallintine}
<D>__{you're out of line, frost.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{am i? or am i just the first to say out loud what we've all been thinking?}
<A>__{the fact that no one answers is telling. dragonetti glowers at the other elders, sensing the tide turning.}
<C>__{dragonetti}
<D>__{the shadows suit us, frost. we've existed this way for thousands of years. who are you to challenge our ways?}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{someone who's sick of living off scraps. the coming age belongs to us, not the humans!}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{when the final war between our races comes, who do you want leading the charge?}
<A>__{frost stabs an accusing finger at the overlord.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{some withered up fossil ready to snap like a brittle bone at the first sign of change?}
<A>__{dragonetti growls like an beast, raking his claws across the tyro vampire's face, knocking him to the ground.}
<C>__{dragonetti}
<D>__{get out!!!}
<A>__{frost picks himself up, touches the gashes on his cheek. looks at his fingers, licks the blood from them.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{careful, old fang. you might wake up one day and find yourself extinct.}
<A>__{frost smiles at dragonetti and calmly exits the room.}
