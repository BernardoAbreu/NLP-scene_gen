<L>__{interior m's office, mi 6 day}
<A>__{bond enters. sir robert king is perched on the edge of m's desk. two glasses, a bottle of scotch open.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{sir robert king, james bond.}
<A>__{king moves toward bond with an easy, patrician smile. bond notes a tiny badge in his lapel like the glass eye of a stuffed snake.}
<C>__{sir robert}
<D>__{thanks for getting my money back never expected to see it again. you're the kind of man i could use. though i won't offend certain parties by asking you to join king industries.}

<C>__{bond}
<D>__{construction's not exactly my line.}

<C>__{m}
<D>__{it's a report on weapons security in the former soviet union, which, as you know, is shaky at best. he's had several instances of sabotage at the pipeline, and he's understandably concerned. he called me the moment he realized its sensitive nature.}
<A>__{she pours a scotch for bond. he drops some ice in, thoughtful.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{someone was watching over me in geneva. a guardian angel with a laser sight.}
<A>__{he stops, rubs his thumb and forefinger together a strange sizzling where he touched the ice. realization sinks in.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{king.}
