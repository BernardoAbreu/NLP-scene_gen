<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{a dented red chevrolet fishtails on a dry mudflat, whipping up dustdevils. they're all laughing (strange noise) in a circle somewhere on the edge of a precipice in deep arroyos and magnificent rocks and cacti... a football huddle of faces ray, john, robbie, jim the four doors... laughing with the first mad impulse of the peyote. pam is vomiting her brains out as dorothy tries to comfort her on the edge of a cliff... jim panthers up the dune.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{everybody having a good time?}
<A>__{they hug. she throws up again.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{...awright, pretty good, it gets better.}
<A>__{jim holds his head. feels the ride.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{woa!! it's fast.}
<A>__{jump cuts: jim and pam are touching each other. face. shadows. sand falls from pam's hand. jim turns to hawk at a bird. "hawk! hawk!" then pam is dancing alone on the dune. abruptly jim is back in the circle with the doors in a sense torn between them and pam. extreme closeups of their faces, their eyes, the tensions of the trip tearing apart their teeth as they go from the laughing to the dangerous part.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{when the serpent appears, his head is ten feet long and five feet wide. he has one red eye and one green eye. he's deadly and he's seven miles long. as he moves on his scales is written all the history of the world, all people, all actions, all of us our little pictures on the scales, god it's big! and it's eating as it moves all the time, devouring, digesting consciousness, power, a monster of energy!}
<A>__{john shutters as does robbie and ray. jim seems possessed.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{we must kiss the snake on the tongue, if it senses our fear, it will eat us instantly. but if we kiss it without fear, the snake will take us through the garden and out the gate. to our freedom we must ride this snake. to the end of time.}
<A>__{pause. he has instilled a flux of fear in the group.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i think i'm fucked up. i'm not thinking right.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you're fucked up john. go with it, confusion is the sound of creation.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you should see your eyes right now, you're death. look at your eyes you're crazy man, you look crazy. you scare me.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no no no john john. god is crazy too. god is part insane as well as sane. not in control all the time. dionysus was the god of the wine. he made ecstasy but he also made madness. madness is all right. that's what you want, isn't it, isn't it? where's that joint?}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{i get scared thinking of all the choices inside. i could go. i could stay. i can live anywhere. i could die now if i wanted. it's limitless choice... and no one cares.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{die robbie.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what the fuck!}
<C>__{pam}
<P>__{(wandering in)}
<D>__{i don't know what i am. i'm on the cusp of sagittarius and capricorn. sagittarius is wild and capricorn domestic and safe, so i don't know which one to be.}
<A>__{jim looking at her, smiles.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(into the same lens)}
<D>__{oh my god, the light, it's so beautiful ray. can you see it... it's all one... honey?}
<A>__{ray has his head buried in his hands.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm in pain man. i want something from the peyote. i feel the universe functioning perfectly but i'm still perfectly locked inside myself. instead of oneness, i feel total isolation. aloneness. fear... pain... jim, all i feel is pain.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{pain makes me feel more alive ray. pain is meant to wake us up. people try to hide their pain but they're wrong.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i feel lust. i want to fuck everything i can, and i know it will never be enough.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{pam wants you.}
<P>__{(normal)}
<D>__{you're a good catholic john, you want it so you can feel guilty about it... fuck death away john.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i feel fear... so bad i just numb out all my feelings. i'm afraid of my father, i'm afraid of yahweh... i wish i could play my guitar.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{maybe you should kill your father robbie. he tried to kill you. kill him!}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i'm so fucking scared.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{but you're alive! it's beautiful! fear, pain, lust, we've got to know all our feelings before we can come out the other side free men. don't feel ashamed of yourselves, don't let society destroy your reality. our freedom's the only thing worth dying for, it's the only thing worth living for!}
<A>__{he takes ray and robbie's hands, his voice calming them, reform the circle. john hesitant. not all will enter the gates at evening.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(cold sweats)}
<D>__{i'm not gonna make it man. i'm scared jim, i'm still scared. blindness is coming on.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{then use us john, use our strength, it's us four now, a tribe of warriors, everything we have comes from the same source, the great creator of being. trust him, trust us. ride the snake. . . i promise you i will be with you till the end of time.}
<A>__{pulling john into the circle, bonding, their four heads sunk to the desert floor, jim making wild indian sounds, deep throated "shoooh... shoooh"... now humming a song from the desert.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{my wild love went riding... mmmmmm. she rode all the day. she ride to the devil. and ask for him to pay... shooo shoooo}
<A>__{the others join in his chant, the four rising and falling like a collective breath.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(ad lib)}
<D>__{...she went to the desert she went to the sea joseph we did see...}
<A>__{suddenly jim breaks and rises out of the circle. ray, robbie, john, all looking at him. the same need. pamela, the desperation of her eyes.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{...i'm lying to you. i am scared.}
<A>__{he goes, his boots in the sand.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{jim, where are you going.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(looking back)}
<D>__{i will be back. i gotta go alone.}
<A>__{pamela calling from another dune, far away.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{jim! jim... come here, dance... don't go away.}
<A>__{his pov of her, receding. she screams for him. he's in pain. cannot help her. a bird of prey in the sky. jim moving across a lunar landscape. special effect: the sun is black like night or else white in a black sky. voices in the distance. "jim, where are you going?" a mother's voice, a father's voice.}
<B>__{doors song}
<A>__{can you picture what will be so limitless and free desperately in need of some stranger's hand in a desperate land lost in a roman wilderness of pain and all the children are insane: waiting for the summer rain}
<B>__{flashbacks}
