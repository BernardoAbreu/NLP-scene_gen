<B>__{bare white room}
<A>__{thirty feet square. cris johnson, wearing a jail uniform, sits in a heavy chair that is bolted to the floor. mid twenties, jaded, rebellious, handsome as a statue, cris radiates a serene, if somewhat scruffy, charisma. he faces a plasma screen monitor on a bare wall. to the left of the screen, an unframed mirror; to the right, a digital clock calendar. a woman's face appears on the plasma screen. callie ferris. thirty. tailored. angular. kate hepburn ish.}
<D>__{ferris on monitor mr. johnson, you've been sent to us by the state authorities for testing. we want to determine if there's any substance to your claims. cris fire away.}
<C>__{ferris on monitor}
<D>__{if we can verify your ability, we may be able to help you avoid a criminal trial.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{and "we" is...? ferris on monitor homeland security.}
<A>__{ferris' face is replaced on the plasma screen by a series of random video clips. hang gliding. traffic jam. volcano erupting.}
<D>__{ferris on monitor now if you would, please look at the monitor and tell us what you see, say, five minutes from now.}
<A>__{cris looks at the clock. 16:32 march 9, 2006. he squints and the clock speeds up a little.}
<P>__{ferris (o.c.)}
<D>__{are you there yet?}
<A>__{in a few seconds, the clock reads 16:37. on the monitor. ferris' image has been replaced by footage of surfers riding big waves in hawaii.}
<D>__{cris surfers.}
<P>__{ferris (o.c.)}
<D>__{good. now can you move ahead ten minutes.}
<A>__{varied images fast forward on the plasma screen. he arrives at 16:47 and reports on what he sees.}
<D>__{cris ants crawling up a tree.}
<P>__{ferris (o.c.)}
<D>__{excellent. can you get to 1900 hours?}
<A>__{cris looks ahead and squints.}
<B>__{clock}
<A>__{minutes whiz by.}
<B>__{plasma screen}
<A>__{clips play and change almost too fast to be recognized. clock cris gets to 19:00 and keeps going. mirror cris has a five o'clock shadow. clock hours tick off like an accelerating metronome. mirror cris sports a three day stubble. he struggles to get out of the chair, but he is now strapped into it, bound at the wrist and ankle. his face fills with rage. plasma screen the evening news zips by. talking heads. reportage. mirror like a window into a time machine. cris' beard lengthens. he grows pale. his clothes change every few seconds. rage gives way to the panic of a man trapped on a runaway train. plasma screen the news dissolves into a blur. mirror cris ages before his own eyes. wrinkles etch into skin. hair greys, recedes. outrage ebbs into hollow resignation as cris watches himself waste away.}
<D>__{woman's voice sir...sir?}
<A>__{cris' tired old eyes look up, confused.}
