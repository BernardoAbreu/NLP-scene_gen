<L>__{interior parrish's office day}
<A>__{alone in his office, parrish's ebullient mood immediately changes. leaning against the back of the couch, he stares out through floor to ceiling windows, surveying the manhattan skyline: cogitates. he takes a seat on the couch, opens a folder, suddenly he flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder. it is sharp but brief, he notices it but what it does not continue, he ignores it. parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the pain comes again. he reaches for his shoulder, tries to massage the pain, it does not subside. parrish stands, trying to shake it off, but it refuses to go away, some thing is unmistakably wrong. now a sound which he has come to recognize, makes itself heard:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{frozen with surprise, parrish's eyes search the room for the source of the sound, it comes from no particular direction, yet surrounds him. suddenly parrish's symptoms sharply intensify, he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a corner of the desk, holds on with one hand, with the other clutches at his shoulder and arm, the pain has violently seized the upper part of his body. he breaks out in a sweat, his pallor now waxen as the voice repeats itself:}
<P>__{voice (v.o., cont'd)}
<D>__{...yes.}
<A>__{parrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him on the one hand, the voice coming at him from the outer, each aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself, consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a hallucination but which he is certain is not. parrish is possessed. he angles his face in every direction, arbi trarily chooses one and now embarrassedly, unconsciously, enrage, responds to the voice.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{'yes' what?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{'yes' is the answer to your question.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i didn't ask any question.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i believe you did.}
<A>__{parrish is absolutely confounded, seized up with pain and consternation at this unseen voice which has such presence and reality.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{goddammit, what is going on?!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i think you know }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{try. because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{what you were talking about.}
<A>__{parrish gasps.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what is this? who is this fucking guy?}
<A>__{he holds on tight to the corner of the desk, sweat dripping, his skin ashen. now he addresses the voice again, searching for it in another direction:}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{tell me who you are!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{are you giving me orders?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i }
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{no, you're not. you're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.}
<A>__{a spasm, the worst one yet, finally it subsides and there is an eerie silence in the room, a void, almost more disturbing than the voice that has filled it.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{where are you? are you there?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{it's enough now.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{please. talk to me }
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{there's going to be plenty of time for that.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what do you mean?!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i think you know }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{know what?}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{know what, goddammit!}
<A>__{the voice is gone. parrish searches the corner, but the room has lost the quality it had when it was inhabited by the voice, it is now just parrish's office. faint squeals of traffic from the street, then a knock at the door. parrish touches his shoulder, the pain is gone, but he is still wet with sweat, the knock again. parrish straightens himself up, adjusts his tie, runs his fingers through his hair, blinks as he addresses the door.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{jennifer enters.}
<C>__{jenifer}
<D>__{i've been buzzing you, mr. parrish. are you all right?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{jenifer}
<D>__{lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought _}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{no. nothing.}
<C>__{jenifer}
<D>__{nothing?}
<A>__{parrish is within himself, doesn't answer.}
<C>__{jenifer }
<D>__{why don't i think of something?}
<A>__{parrish still doesn't answer, however jennifer is satisfied, correctly hearing his silence as an affirmative. she has her hand on the door, 'open' or 'closed'? he nods and she closes it. utter silence again. parrish's eyes search the room, nothing there.}
