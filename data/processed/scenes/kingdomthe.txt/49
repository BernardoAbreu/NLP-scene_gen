<L>__{interior saudi shack night, saudi time}
<A>__{a tiny framed saudi national flag in the middle of a wall: green with a white sword underlining script that reads: there is no god but allah. no other decoration. the none too muffled sounds of traffic: a lone window overlooking a four lane boulevard. then the athan (call to prayer) for the isha (last of the five daily prayers) trumps the traffic noise. sergeant haytham enters, bandaged, blank, then a small smile crosses his face. an old man's weathered voice, in arabic:}
<C>__{old voice }
<D>__{just in time.}
<A>__{haytham's p.o.v.: his father, glass frail, lying in a bed, a small tv nearby, on but soundless. haytham goes into a routine: rolls out two prayer mats, steps to his father, reaches down to pick him up. his father readies himself stops everything when he sees the bandages up close, the black bruises with outer rings of purple covering 1 2 of his son's cheek. looks into his boy's eyes.}
<C>__{haytham's father}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{haytham not returning the gaze, hoists his father into his arms pain shoots up his arms from his damaged wrists.}

<D>__{look at me.}
<A>__{haytham looks into his father's eyes now. no words. haytham's eyes well with tears. after a long silence:}
<C>__{haytham's father }
<D>__{is this how they now treat the men who protect them? can you look at me? you cannot, can you? can you look at yourself?}
<A>__{haytham stares at his father.}
<C>__{haytham's father }
<D>__{you are protecting the true enemies of god.}
