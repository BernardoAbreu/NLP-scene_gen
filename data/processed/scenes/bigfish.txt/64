<L>__{exterior the town of spectre day}
<A>__{it's a main street with stores on each side: cole's pharmacy, talbot's five and dime, al's country store. everything is old, but this isn't a ghost town. in fact, there's a group of about 20 citizens spilling out to see edward approach. most are smiling. there are even a few tears of joy. what's more, all of these people are barefoot.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{friend!}
<A>__{a forty year old man named beamen comes out of the seed store to greet edward. friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest thing the town has to a mayor. he's carrying a clipboard.}
<C>__{beamen}
<D>__{welcome to ya. what's your name?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{edward bloom.}
<A>__{beamen checks the clipboard. not finding the name, he flips forward a few pages. still looking...}
<C>__{beamen}
<D>__{bloom like a flower?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{beamen}
<D>__{oh. here! right here. edward bloom. we weren't expecting you yet.}
<A>__{still confused...}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you were expecting me?}
<C>__{beamen}
<D>__{not yet.}
<A>__{a helpful woman named mildred chimes in:}
<C>__{mildred}
<D>__{you must have taken a shortcut.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i did. it nearly killed me.}
<C>__{beamen}
<D>__{mmm hmm. life'll do that to you. and truthfully, the long way is easier, but it's longer.}
<C>__{mildred}
<D>__{much longer.}
<C>__{beamen}
<D>__{and you're here now, and that's what matters.}
<A>__{beamen's daughter jenny (8) hides behind her father, peering around to look at the handsome stranger.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{what is this place?}
<C>__{beamen}
<D>__{the town of spectre. best kept secret in alabama. says here you're from ashton, right? last person we had from ashton was norther winslow.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{the poet? what ever happened to him?}
<C>__{beamen}
<D>__{he's still here. let me buy you a drink. i will tell you all about it. hell, i will have him tell you.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{no. i've gotta meet somebody. i'm already running late.}
<A>__{he didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's laughing.}
<C>__{beamen}
<D>__{son, i already told you. you're early.}
