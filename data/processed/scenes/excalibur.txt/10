<A>__{from the horizon a front of fog advances toward the castle to envelop it, and continues across the gulf to the circle of stones.}
<L>__{exterior gate, tintagle castle twilight}
<A>__{the portal opens and a small force of armored men, led by the duke of cornwall, exits. a fog is thickening all around them.}
<L>__{exterior cliff above the sea twilight}
<A>__{the advancing front envelops merlin and uther, eddying around the stones. all else is obliterated.}

<D>__{mount your horse.}
<A>__{the king does.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{ride straight to the castle, across the sea of fog.}
<A>__{uther spurs straight for the edge of the cliff, then reins in his horse abruptly.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{but the cliff, the sea...}
<A>__{merlin rages, crazed.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{ride across! across the bridges of desire. your lust will hold you up. for i have just woven it into the fabric of the world. this is magic making solid what is in the mind, and unsolid, that which is already solid.}
<A>__{he gives the horse a stinging blow with his staff. the horse and uther charge forward into a gallop and stepping off where the hidden edge of the cliff would be, hoofbeats ceasing and the horse dropping for the blink of an eye, they gallop across the fog.}
