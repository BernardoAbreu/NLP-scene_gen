<T>__{so obvious:}
<C>__{gang}
<D>__{scam pool honeys!}
<L>__{exterior public pool day}
<A>__{teenage pool honeys arranged particularly on their beach towels along the deck, soak up the rays in their polka dot bikinis.}
<C>__{the gang}
<A>__{rushes out in cut off shorts, and banzais the shallow end. ham leaps over the water like a graceful manatee.}
<C>__{ham}
<D>__{hamonball!}
<A>__{kersplash! a ham tsunami sloshes the coppertone'd bods of}
<C>__{pool honeys}
<A>__{they're up and screaming at him.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{benny would've played ball all day and all night... rain shine, tidal wave, whatever, it didn't matter. baseball was the only thing he cared about and everything else was just a waste of time.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but, of all the things we ever did besides baseball, goin' to the pool was what he tolerated best. even though none of us had ever seen a playboy magazine which we constantly lied about we figured the pool was the next best thing to being there.}
<C>__{the gang}
<A>__{dunks each other, play "attack sub," etc...}
<C>__{narrator }
<D>__{it wasn't the pool honeys like we said, 'cause if any one of them had come up to any one of us, we'd of peed our pants.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we went for... the lifeguard.}
<C>__{the lifeguard}
<A>__{is unbelievable. in fact, it's wendy peffercorn. she slides coppertone up and down her legs.}
<C>__{the gang}
<A>__{one by one, stop foolin' around. chest deep in the shallow end, they're a detached and frozen pocket of leering dopes. the other 80 kids in the pool play on around them.}
<C>__{squints}
<A>__{is suddenly afflicted.}
<C>__{narrator }
<D>__{and one day, it became too much for michael "squints" palledorous. and he did the most desperate thing any of us had ever seen.}
<C>__{the lifeguard}
<A>__{oils up and down.}
<C>__{the gang}
<A>__{gawks on. (cool hand luke scene):}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{oh, man... yeah yeah yeah yeah, too cruel.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{she don't know what she's doing.}
<C>__{repeat}
<D>__{she don't know what she's doing.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{yeah she does. she knows exactly what she's doing.}
<C>__{squints}
<D>__{i've swum here every summer of my adult life... and every summer there she is.}
<P>__{(losing it)}
<D>__{lotioning... oiling... smiling.}
<P>__{(teeth clenched)}
<D>__{i can't take this no more!}
<B>__{the gang watches as squints}
<A>__{pushes through the water, pulls himself out, and walks really fast to the diving board (taking off his glasses to impress her as he passes.)}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{what's wrong with him? yeah yeah}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{don't know, but that's the deep end, and squints can't swim!}
<C>__{squints}
<A>__{walks the plank to the end. looks wantingly toward}
<C>__{the lifeguard}
<A>__{who smiles back at him.}
<C>__{squints}
<A>__{holds his nose. takes the deep leap. hits the water and...}
<C>__{underwater}
<A>__{...sinks like a stone. squints grins as he founders.}
<C>__{the gang}
<A>__{lines the edge of the deep section.}
<C>__{bertram}
<D>__{squints!}
<C>__{ham}
<D>__{oh my god! he's drowning!}
<C>__{the lifeguard}
<A>__{to the rescue. seconds pass... she surfaces and lays a limp}
<C>__{squints}
<B>__{on the deck}
<A>__{everybody at the pool gathers 'round. the lifeguard lays squints flat. she administers mouth to mouth. the gang watches on tense as hell. squints peeks at them through a secretly opened eye. as the lifeguard is "saving" his sneaky life, squints can no longer restrain himself, he grabs her gives her a sloppy smooch! she tears away. stands up over his wimpy little form:}
<C>__{lifeguard}
<D>__{you little pervert!}
<A>__{she grabs squints by the scruff of the neck. run walks him toward the exit, and...}
