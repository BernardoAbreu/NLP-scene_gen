<L>__{interior mika's apartment building stairwell night}
<A>__{ where she climbs the steps, each creak adding to the possibility of attracting trouble. on the passing floors, we hear doors being opened and shut, footsteps, the distant murmur of voices. could be nothing. could be everything. she presses on.}
<L>__{interior mika's apartment moments later}
<A>__{she opens the door to her apartment, shining the tiny light ahead of her. shadows chase each other across the room as she swings the light one way, then another. there seems to be no one else in the place. but as she hurries into her home office, we see a shadow move behind her. as she packs she begins to hear something, a tapping. the same sound she heard before. she pulls the gun from her purse. with the flashlight spearing the darkness, she goes to her office. again the window is open, the blinds gently blowing against the sash. she is certain the window had been locked. now every shadow is alive. she rushes back to her bedroom aiming in every direction. her flashlight finds her suitcase. on the top of her clothes she sees it: an envelope. perfectly centered. setting the gun down, she picks up the oragami folded envelope. opens it with a shaking finger. black sand spills out. terror steals her breath. behind her, a shadow tilts and reveals the eyes of a ninja. before she can even move, a blade flashes from the darkness, heading for her neck another shadow blocks the blade, knocking mika over the bed. the sounds of a fight erupt all around her but the combatants are almost invisible in the surrounding darkness. her flashlight catches glimpses. impossibly fast, lethal predators trying to kill each other. she crawls towards the spilled contents of her suitcase, towards the gun. another blow arcs for her and is again blocked. her hand finds the handle of the gun. she points into the dark, fires. the gun flash strobes the room, freezing the two ninjas in the blink of a flashbulb. they move towards her until a kick sends her gun flying. she can feel them fighting very close to her and when she finds them with her flashlight, a blade is struck deep blood erupts. one shadow falls to the ground. the other turns towards her. her flashlight shakes as the ninja reaches up and removes his mask. it is raizo. he sees in her eyes that she knows him.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{you know me?}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{raizo }
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{...security camera in new york. recorded you fighting...one of them.}
<A>__{she glances at the dead ninja.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{you know about them?}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{a little.}
<A>__{he waits.}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{uhh well, there are these clans...we're not sure how many.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{nine.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{okay. nine. nine clans. and they apparently have been supplying assassins to governments or anyone who happens to have one hundred pounds of gold lying around for the last thousand years. give or take.}
<A>__{he nods faintly. then turns to his dead "brother".}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{his name was jin.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{you knew him?}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{he was not born an "assassin".}
<A>__{she looks at the dead body.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{...you're from his clan ?}
<A>__{his nod is almost imperceptible.}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{then...why did you stop him?}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{the clans have three kinds of people! people with power. people with money. or people hunting them.}
<A>__{he hears something she can't. she starts to speak, and he stops her with a gesture.}
<C>__{raizo }
<D>__{they're coming.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{the hanta kirra.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{does that mean what i think it means?}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{they won't stop until you are dead.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{oh god.}
<A>__{she looks for her gun.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{the gun won't help you.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{i don't have a lot of options okay. i once took a tae bo class, but that's the extent of my kung fu abilities.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{i can help but you must tell me something first.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{you saw ms. sabatin.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{how did you know that?}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{i've been watching you, waiting for them.}
<A>__{she tries to compute the idea that he's been following her.}
<C>__{raizo }
<D>__{did she give you something?}
<A>__{she nods, raizo's eyes lite up.}
<C>__{raizo }
<D>__{you have them?}
<A>__{shakes her head "no."}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{but i can get them.}
<A>__{he hears something else.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{we need something black. hurry!}
<A>__{she runs with the flashlight to a bureau. inside is a black tablecloth. he pulls her shoes off.}
<C>__{raizo }
<D>__{follow me. step where i step.}
