<L>__{interior colosseum trainer's lair day}
<A>__{proximo is with a dozen other gladiator trainers and the colosseum's orator and majordomo, cassius. they are haggling in an secluded area not far from the arena itself. huge chalkboards chart the day's matches and wagers and odds. colosseum touts continually erase and mark new figures on the chalkboards to keep up with the swiftly changing bouts. the roar of the lions and the unnerving screams of the christians can clearly be heard.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{... and the emperor will have no more animal battles today }
<A>__{upset roars from some of the trainers.}
<D>__{trainer #1 you promised me a bear match, cassius! trainer #2 i have ten damned gorillas! you said gorillas yesterday!}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{talk to the man in the imperial box. who has the next slot...?}
<P>__{(he checks the boards)}
<D>__{ lentulus, gideon, trebonius and proximo }
<P>__{(to proximo)}
<D>__{ nice to have you back, you piratical bastard now listen, the emperor wants the carthage spectacle.}
<A>__{the four trainers explode in a flurry of resistance }
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{no have pity, cassius ! trainer #3 my men are too good for !}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{you give us the carthage match or lose your spot on the rotation but don't worry gold is flowing from the emperor's fingers. trainer #3 it'll cost you }
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{i won't do it for less than 100,000 sesterces ! trainer #4 120,000! all i have is my best thracians!}
<C>__{cassius}
<P>__{(to proximo)}
<D>__{and i want to see this famous spaniard of yours his reputation soars from the provinces. the people are eager for him }
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{i won't throw my spaniard into a spectacle! damn you and damn the rotation!}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{you will and the price will be 90,000 sesterces each }
<P>__{(to all)}
<D>__{ which you all know is exorbitant and if you extorting blood whores try to pawn off lesser fighters on me i will see you dead in the arena tomorrow! trainer #4 my thracians are worth !}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{give me your best, brothers. they die before caesar.}
<A>__{he strides back to the arena. the touts instantly begin making new marks on the boards to represent the mysterious "carthage spectacle" as some of the trainers hurry out. proximo walks with trainer #4:}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{i give you 30,000 my spaniard will kill at least one of your thracians. trainer #4 30,000?! on a spaniard?! that provincial sun has curdled your brain!}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{then make the wager, you smug bastard!}
<A>__{they disappear down a dark corridor, negotiating all the while.}
