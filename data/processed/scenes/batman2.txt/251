<A>__{the penguin marches alfred in where the rest of the gang's already assembled. frick throws vicki down roughly on a sofa just next to the christmas tree while the goons drag bruce inside.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{i should explain the occasion of our visit. there's a treasure underneath this house and i don't plan to leave until you tell me how to find it. now who's going to talk miss vale?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{the cave. under the house. how do i get there?}
<A>__{the penguin gestures. frick holds the gun to her head.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{i don't know! i swear, i would tell you }
<C>__{penguin}
<P>__{(turning to alfred)}
<D>__{then maybe you'd like to tell me.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{you're no more than a common thief.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{wrong, you old idiot. i happen to be a very uncommon thief.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you going to tell me, or does miss vale get an early present this year?}
<A>__{frick cocks the gun. vicki stares aghast at alfred, who scans the room, weighing his options. trembling, he shuts his eyes }
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{i...don't...know...}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{then go ahead, mr. frick...decorate the tree.}
<A>__{frick's finger tightens on the trigger. vicki winces. alfred starts to blurt something out. but a split second before he can speak }
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{wait!}
<P>__{(crossing over to vicki)}
<D>__{we don't know how to get down there yet. we may need her when bruce wakes up.}
<A>__{the penguin sighs and waves frick off. alfred and vicki heave simultaneous sighs of relief. he throws her a shamefaced look but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made the right play.}
<C>__{selina }
<D>__{besides i want this one for myself. so pretty...i'm going to give her a brand new face for christmas.}
<A>__{the penguin throws a look at bruce, who's still out cold on the floor. he turns to frick and frack.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{why don't you two tie up our host?}
<A>__{alfred sits beside vicki while selina wanders off to tour the premises. frick and frack, meanwhile, drag bruce into a back parlor which opens off the room they're in.}
