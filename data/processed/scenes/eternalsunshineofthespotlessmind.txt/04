<L>__{interior waiting room day}
<A>__{subtitled: fifty years earlier every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall, magazines on end tables, a sad looking potted plant, generic seascape paintings on the walls. the receptionist, mary, 25, can be seen typing in the reception area. behind her are shelves and shelves of medical files. the door opens and clementine enters. she's in her early thirties, zaftig in a faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt. she's decidedly funky and has blue hair. mary looks up.}

<D>__{yes, please have a seat. he'll be right with you.}
<A>__{clementine sits. she looks tired, maybe hungover. she picks up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest.}
