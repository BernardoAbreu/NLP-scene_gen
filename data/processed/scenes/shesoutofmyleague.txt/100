<A>__{a wider shot reveals the nascar theme wedding of eric and debbie. kirk stands among the groomsmen. each are dressed in tuxes that represent the colors, numbers and sponsors of certain drivers. molly stands among the bridesmaids. each dressed in a checkered flag gown. ron and marnie are also in the wedding party. debbie hands her mulatto baby to the preacher so that she and eric can share a disgusting wide open mouth kiss. debbie grabs eric's ass while eric gropes her breasts. stainer and wheel in the sky kick into "any way you want it" from a bandstand nearby. patty dances in front of stainer he winks back at her. devon cuts up a wedding cake that looks like a full sized racing wheel and tire.}
