<L>__{interior subway locker room}
<A>__{a dark, abandoned locker room once used for transit workers. susan and peter walk in with the boys, nervous in the off limits area.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{it was in that corner over there.}
<A>__{davis points to a bank of dented metal lockers.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{sucker was fast, man.}
<P>__{(picks up a pipe.)}
<D>__{had to take it out with one a these.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{okay, guys. we'll take it from here.}
<A>__{peter hands ricky some money. the boy looksdown at it slyly.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{make it ten an' we won't tell the cops you're here.}
<A>__{peter regards the little scam artist dryly.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{let's keep it at five and i won't condemn your clubhouse.}
<A>__{peter hands him a couple of dollars more. the two boys take off. peter removes a penlight from his pocket. dust covers everything. a forest of copper tubing and pipes where the sinks used to be.}
<B>__{peter}
<A>__{inspects the floor. it's littered with cheap objects: chipped combs, used rubbers, soggy newspapers, smeared heroin syringes. something shiny catches his eye. he picks it up.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{look, a broken tooth...}
<A>__{something rustles nearby. he notices an old, rotting poster on the back wall. it seems oddly textured somehow. he walks toward it.}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{kneeling, pushes aside a dented trash bin. behind it, there is a cabinet with rusty sliding doors. a subway train rumbles by outside, the sound echoes off the tile walls. susan forces the door back. she peeks through the opening. her face stares back at her from a dirty pocket mirror. she starts pulling something out.}
<B>__{peter}
<A>__{at the oddly texture wall. he shines the penlight at it... ...and is met with a flutter of wings. moths, perfectly camouflaged against the poster on the wall, whiz past him. peter recoils.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{he nods.}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{turns back to her locker. she withdraws a cheap plastic necklace from it. as she removes it, it breaks. a coulpe of beads fall away... ...rolls under the locker... ...and bounce once, twice, thrice each time going deeper till they comes to a stop. susan peers where the beads fell.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{there's something under here.}
<A>__{peter comes over, kneels by her. susan takes a handful of beads and throws them at the base of the locker. camera tracks to follow one of them. it rolls all the way under. a moment later, from some interior space, the sound of it bouncing on cement. he shines his light inside.}
