<L>__{exterior lake day}
<B>__{pov driver}
<A>__{grease covered hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a white van speeding out of control toward a lake! the van crashes through a railing and plunges into the water. in moments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped. drowning. horrible. and on the rearview mirror, six floral scented air freshners.}

<B>__{in the background}
<A>__{clear looks at passing room numbers while hurrying down the corridor. she comes to a room with a huge cart parked outside, blocking the door. she looks up to see b 187. clear leans into it, pushing it out of the way of the door.}

<D>__{eugene? are you in there?}
<A>__{eugene's room eugene strains to hear through the thick door.}
<C>__{clear }
