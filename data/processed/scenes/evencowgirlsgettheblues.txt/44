<L>__{exterior ranch day}
<A>__{views of sissy in her whooping crane outfit dancing to debussy in front of the disney film crew. the documentary being directed by an effusive frenchman. view of the camera crew training their long telephoto lenses on siwash lake. they all seem to be wearing the same trademark satin baseball jackets with one logo or another on their backs. another view of the lake, from above, from the chink's point of view and our first view of the chink. the chink spies sissy and jelly coming over a ridge. we cannot hear them at first, but sissy and jelly are talking.}

<D>__{......delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her third vision hasn't happened. niwetukame, the mother goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. meanwhile she and debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. tension. cowgirl tension! what a drag.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{what is debbie's position?}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. she says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the new age. she's a real dreamer, that debbie dear.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{you don't agree with debbie, then?}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{i wouldn't say that. i expect she's right, ultimately. but i'm with delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. i can't understand why delores is so uptight about the chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. ee! that grass tickles, doesn't it? god knows i love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. still this is cowgirl territory and i will stand with delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. i guess i've always been a scrapper. look. this scar. only twelve years old and i was felled by a silver bullet.}
<A>__{jelly takes sissy's hand, carefully avoiding the thumbs and helps her feel the depression in her belly. the depression is a dimple, like another navel. after a hungry stillness, like intermission at a wolf dance, rhythms are established. jelly and sissy are socked into one another now, and they arch and push and corkscrew and jackknife softly but with pronounced cadence. everything becomes scrambled. they rock each other in cradles of sweat and saliva, until we can see nothing. noisy breaths buck out of sissy: "jelly, jelly" but she can't hear sissy because she is screaming. hysterical from the scalding hot softness of girl love.}
