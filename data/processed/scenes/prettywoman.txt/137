<L>__{interior penthouse bedroom morning}
<A>__{vivian is still asleep. she is face down on the bed, the sheets just covering her to her waist. edward stares down at her. he gently reaches out and runs a finger down the soft line of her spine. vivian murmurs contentedly.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{mmm.}
<P>__{(opening her eyes; looking at him)}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{edward smiles at her softly. and then:}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{better get dressed. we're having guests.}
<L>__{interior penthouse bedroom day}
<A>__{vivian is wearing her yellow dress. she stares at herself in the bedroom mirror. her hair... her make up... she realizes how different she is now, realizes that she likes it. edward comes out of the bathroom. he crosses to the closet for a tie.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{here. let me.}
<A>__{she comes over, starts to tie his tie for him. he is very aware of the closeness of her. she smiles at him. he smiles; puts his hand on her stopping her for a moment. looking up, she sees that he is serious now; no more jokes. he releases her hand.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{one more night and you're finally rid of me.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i have to go to new york tomorrow.}
<A>__{vivian says nothing.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{but i will be back in los angeles. soon. i'd like to see you again. i thought we could work out something... an arrangement.}
<A>__{vivian is silent.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{i will get you an apartment, buy you a car }
<A>__{vivian sighs, letting something go inside. finished with his tie, she turns away.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(not unkindly)}
<D>__{what else? you gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{it wouldn't be like that. i want to get you off the street. you'll have a different kind of life. what's wrong with that?}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{i'm sorry. that's very sweet, edward, and i know you mean it...}
<A>__{she is silent.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{vivian, i've thought about this a lot. this is the best solution.}
<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(shakes her head "no,"}
<D>__{then continues tying}
<P>__{his tie)}
<D>__{when i was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when i was bad, which was pretty often. i'd stare out the window up there and make believe i was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen. then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times i had that dream did the knight say, "come on baby, i will put you up in a great condo."}
<A>__{she finished his tie.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{vivian, life's not a fairy tale.}
<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(softly; to herself)}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{hey, don't mind me. i'm being stupid.}
<P>__{(more)}
<D>__{i will think about it, okay? it's a real good offer for a whore.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i've never treated you like a whore.}
<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(not mean)}
<D>__{you just did.}
<A>__{the doorbell suddenly rings in the living room.}
