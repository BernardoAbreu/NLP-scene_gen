<L>__{interior helen's house. kitchen day}
<D>__{stepan is sitting at the kitchen table, translating tatiana's diary aloud, as helen transcribes it onto a note pad. stepan's translation breaks up with emotion but he tries to remain detached. helen also tries hard to concentrate on her task but wipes away a tear as she writes. tatiana's v.o. slowly blends into stepan's voice...}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{...like potato sacks. kirill came down after me and he hit me until i was bleeding. then he tried to rape me but he couldn't do it... he just got madder and madder and kept hitting me. in the end his father came down. it was the father who raped me. he shouted at his son...'if you don't break a horse, it will never be tame, kirill'. they hear a key in the door and prepare for anna's arrival. when she enters she feels the tense silence. after a moment, helen tries to be bright...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{hello dear. how was your night? anna sees the tears in both their eyes. she sees the diary and the transcription and sits down.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{stepan's arthritis is playing up. i'm taking dictation. helen gets to her feet.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{would you like some tea or something?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no. anna gently pushes helen back into her seat.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{he came to see me. silence.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{the man from the restaurant. he came to the hospital. stepan leaps to his feet.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{i told you this would happen! i told you!}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{sit down stepan.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{the devil is loose now. everyone begins to talk at once...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i know it's my fault...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it's no one's fault...}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{they are in this room now. they are cancer...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{we should just sit down calmly and think...}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{i have a friend from ukraine who owns a gun....}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{stepan!!}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{...from the war in afghanistan.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{don't talk about guns... anna suddenly stands up.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{shut up both of you!!! silence. everyone catches their breath.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{ok... now... what would dad have done? a pause.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{we all know what he would have done. stepan heads for the kitchen cupboard and produces a bottle of vodka. rather than admonish him, anna and helen both nod agreement. stepan pours three large vodkas. stepan knocks his down. anna and helen take sips.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{and then he would have been practical.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{he would ask if there were bullets for the gun.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no! this isn't our world. we're just... ordinary people.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{i dealt with the vory v zakone when i worked for the kgb.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you never worked for the fucking kgb!}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{anna!}
<C>__{stepan}
<P>__{(primly)}
<D>__{i was an auxiliary!}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{please! a stand off. finally...}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{what did this man want?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{the diary. in return he'll give us an address for tatiana's family. for christine's family. a pause. they all look to each other.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{and that's all he wants? stepan is utterly astounded.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{you cannot do deals with these people!}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{this isn't a deal. it's an exchange of information.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{have you forgotten already what i just read to you?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{we must be practical.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{stepan, i think he was threatening to harm christine.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{then it's settled.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{no!! no!! no!!}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(repeating as a mantra)}
<D>__{stepan, this isn't our world. we are ordinary people. stepan stares at them both for a long time. finally he gets to his feet and points to the diary.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{she was an ordinary person. he leaves. anna and helen hold hands, genuinely close now for the first time in a long time.}
