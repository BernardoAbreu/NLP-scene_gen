<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{jaeger and wes}
<A>__{they work the rope, helping epps up. he gets to the lip of the crevice, and pulls himself over. he's breathing hard, and lets his pack slide to the ground. trying not to sound too rattled.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what the hell took so long.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{just had to get the pack unhooked from the line. it didn't seem that long.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{not when you're up here with the gold, i guess not.}
<A>__{throwing epps' own words back at him:}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{not losing trust, are you?}
<A>__{epps lets this go.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it'll be too dark to make our way back now. let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what about the gold?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what about it?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{maybe we should split it up now.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what if we get separated? way i see it if something happens i want to be carrying my share.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{wes might be right about that.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it stays as it is. we're halfway home now. let's not blow it by people getting ideas.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you're the one with all the ideas.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you've had your say, wes. now leave it.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold. maybe you've already got things worked out.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{maybe i do.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{maybe i don't need your ideas. maybe i can do better on my own.}
<A>__{epps sees trouble coming, and deals with it the only way he knows how. casually he turns from wes as if he's about to let things go. suddenly he spins back around throwing a punch to wes' jaw that sends him to the ground. wes puts a hand to his mouth. it comes back stained red. wes goes on the boil.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you got no reason to do that!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i told you: when i straighten someone out they stay straightened. this is how it works: nobody touches the gold. except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. agreed?}
<A>__{jaeger wastes no time jumping in.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah. sure. that sounds like a plan to me.}
<A>__{wes, still on the ground, fumes.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you got no reason to hit me. i'm getting tired of you and jaeger pushing me around.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{then get up and do something about it.}
<A>__{wes thinks about it, but that's all he does. he's not ready to cross that line yet.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{then just lay there and bleed.}
<A>__{epps takes up his pack and moves off to bed down. jaeger does the same. wes just lays on the ground...and bleeds.}
