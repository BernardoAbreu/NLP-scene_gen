<A>__{a small camper trailer sits all by its lonesome in the middle of a barren texas wasteland. a subtitle appears under this image;}
<D>__{"the city of austin texas."}
<A>__{a fist knocks on the trailer door. it opens, revealing bill's brother, budd. not the slick willie budd with the black suit and the silver tipped black cowboy boots we saw earlier at the wedding chapel massacre. no, the budd we see now is the budd who climbed into a bottle five years ago, got himself comfortable, and decided to live there. bill, looking like a cool million, stands out in the dirt and dust of budd's lot of land, looking up at his brother in his natural habitat. in the b.g. we can see elle driver lounging in the passenger's seat. budd, surprised by the visitor, says;}
