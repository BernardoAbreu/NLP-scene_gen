<A>__{the tortoise heads towards the trough, to the gurgling accompaniment. it reaches the shade only to be greeted by the obstacle of some tennis shoes, a frock. it clambers over as the water begins to belch out. hana, naked, kneeling in the trough, receives the shower with a great yelp of shivering joy.}

<A>__{it's dark, but something is going on here. hana is caught by the stray shafts of moonlight. she is scratching something on the flagstones. her skirt is bunched up around her thighs. she throws something in the air. it's a spile, used to tap into the maple tree for syrup. it lands with a crack. suddenly she is flying across the space, a hop, a skip, a jump. then turns at the other end, dips for the stone, then back again, in this blindman's version of hopscotch.}
