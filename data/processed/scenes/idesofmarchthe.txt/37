<L>__{interior hotel conference room minutes later}
<A>__{the room has been transformed into an interview space.}
<D>__{on air }
<A>__{charlie rose and gov. morris mid interview...}
<C>__{gov. morris}
<D>__{is it a difficult decision? i would have to believe that it is... would i do it? no... but i can't see myself... or anyone... certainly not a government, telling a woman what she can do with her body.}
<C>__{charlie rose}
<D>__{so you would appoint a judge to...}
<C>__{gov. morris}
<D>__{... i would consider it arrogant to judge someone until i've walked in their shoes.}
<C>__{charlie rose}
<D>__{but you're against the death penalty?}
<C>__{gov. morris}
<D>__{yes. because of what it says about us as a society.}
<C>__{charlie rose}
<D>__{suppose governor it was your wife...}
<C>__{gov. morris}
<D>__{and she was murdered, what would i do.}
<C>__{charlie rose}
<D>__{it gets more complicated when it's personal.}
<C>__{gov. morris}
<D>__{sure...well if i could get to him i'd find a way to kill him.}
<C>__{charlie rose}
<D>__{so you, you governor would impose the death penalty.}
<C>__{gov. morris}
<D>__{no, i would commit a crime for which i would happily go to jail.}
<C>__{charlie rose}
<D>__{then why not let society do that?}
<C>__{gov. morris}
<D>__{because society has to be better than the individual. if i were to do that i would be wrong.}
<C>__{charlie rose}
<D>__{and what about guns?}
<C>__{gov. morris}
<D>__{isn't it time for a commercial. they laugh.}
<C>__{charlie rose}

<C>__{gov. morris}
<D>__{that's unfortunate.}
