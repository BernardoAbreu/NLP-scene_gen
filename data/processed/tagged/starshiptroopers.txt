<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{here in history and moral philosophy we've explored the decline of democracy when social scientists brought the world to the brink of chaos, and how the veterans took control and imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since... you know these facts but have i taught you anything of value ? you. why are only citizens allowed to vote ?}

<C>__{rasczak}
<D>__{in my classroom, you bet. whether it's exerted by ten or ten billion, political authority is violence by degree. the people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it.}

<D>__{aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.}
<C>__{biology teacher}
<D>__{just a bug, eh ? we humans like to think we are nature's finest achievement. i'm afraid it isn't true. this arkellian sand beetle is superior in many ways. it has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of society.}

<C>__{biology teacher}

<C>__{biology teacher}
<D>__{they are relatively stupid by human standards. workers have an iq of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the arachnids have colonized planets. over a million years of evolution, nature has provided the arachnids with the biological means to hurl their spore into space.}
