<L>__{interior hospital pre op room early morning}
<A>__{adam lies on a gurney. dr. lamb, the neurosurgeon performing adam's surgery enters. he's wired on espresso. behind him is nurse wong who looks like she'd rather be anywhere else.}
<C>__{dr. lamb}
<D>__{good morning adam, how are you feeling? good. good. good. good.}
<A>__{despite dr. lamb's already thick glasses, he holds adam's medical chart right up to his to his face.}
<C>__{dr. lamb }
<D>__{so we're going to be removing your kidney? right? or is it the left? just kidding. that's doctor humor.}
<A>__{adam forces a small chuckle. he's completely terrified.}
<C>__{dr. lamb }
<D>__{nurse wong here needs you to sign a few papers, so i'm going to leave her to do her job, and i will see you after the surgery.}
<A>__{dr. lamb exits. nurse wong hands adam a giant pile of disclaimers to sign.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what is all this?}
<C>__{nurse wong}
<D>__{hospital liability and disclaimer forms...in case they need to fuse your spine or remove any organs. you know, the usual.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{oh, great.}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{glad to hear there's nothing unusual about removing organs.}
<A>__{adam signs the documents and hands them back to nurse wong.}

<D>__{here take these. they're special. i got them from canada.}
<A>__{adam looks closely at the pills they read "nuprin."}

<D>__{mom, this is nuprin.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{i know isn't it great?}

<C>__{adam}
<D>__{egh em. mom. mom.}
<A>__{adam nods for his mother to leave.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{alright. come on art, let's go to the waiting room.}
<A>__{on her way out, edith turns to katie and notices a cross around her neck.}
<C>__{edith }
<P>__{(displeased)}
<D>__{hmmm.}
<A>__{edith and art exit. adam is left alone with katie. they're both nervous.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i brought you flowers. not sure why, i didn't know what else }
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{they're great, thank you.}
<A>__{katie sits on the bed next to adam.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{so how you doing?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i'm a little freaked out.}
<A>__{a small german anesthesiologist enters. there is something incredibly unsettling about her thick accent.}
<C>__{anesthesiologist}
<D>__{hello adam, i am the anesthesiologist. i will give you shot to make you sleep.}
<A>__{adam holds katie's hand.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{will you be here when i wake up?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i'm not going anywhere.}
<C>__{anesthesiologist}
<D>__{now relax, this will take a few minutes to feel the effect.}
<A>__{the anesthesiologist injects the drugs into adam's iv.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{about how long?}
<C>__{anesthesiologist}
<D>__{relax, you will soon begin the sleeping.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well what if it doesn't work. how do you know i won't wake in the middle of the surgery? what if i }
