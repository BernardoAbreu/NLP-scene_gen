<A>__{tracking shot to wall of travis' apartment. camera moves slowly across wall covered with clippings, notes, maps, pictures. we now see their contents clearly: the wall is covered with charles palantine political paraphernalia; there are pictures of him, newspaper articles, leaflets, bumper stickers. as the camera moves along it discovers a sketch of plaza hotel, kennedy airport and cut up sections of city maps with notations written in. there is lengthy n.y. times clipping detailing the increased secret security protection during the primaries. a section pertaining to palantine is underlined. further along there is a sheet reading "traveling schedule" and a calendar for june with finely written notations written over the dates.}
<D>__{travis (v.o.)(contd) ... for some time. true force. all the king's men cannot put it back together again.}
<A>__{as the camera reaches the end of its track, it finds travis, standing, his shirt open, but the mattress. he is wearing the empty holster, and the .44 is in his hand. in the shots that follow travis gives the audience a lesson in gunmanship: travis practices fast drawing the .38 special from his holster and firing it. he hooks the .44 into his pants behind his back and practices withdrawing it. he holds the .44 firmly at an arm's length, tightening his forearm muscles. he has worked out a system of metal gliders taped to his inner forearm, whereby the colt .25 can rest hidden behind the upper forearm until a spring near the elbow is activated, sending the .25 flying down the gliders into his palm. he has cut open his shirt to accomodate the gun mechanism and now checks in the mirror to see how well the gun is hidden. he straps an army combat knife to his calf and cuts a slit in his jeans where the knife can be pulled out quickly. he now tries on various combinations of shirts, sweater and jacket in front of the mirror to see how well he can hide all the handguns he wishes to carry. finally, wearing two western shirts, a sweater and jacket, he manages to obscure the location of all three guns, although he resembles a hunter bundled up against the arctic winter. he sits at the table dum dumming the .44 bullets cutting "x's" across the bullet heads. p.o.v.: he scans the objects of his room through the scope of the .38. travis stands in the middle of his apartment, staring at his palantine wall. his eyes are glazed with introspection; he sees nothing but himself.}

<A>__{travis lies on his mattress, all bundled up in his shirts, sweater, jacket and guns. his face is turned toward the ceiling, but his eyes are closed. although the room is flooded with light, he is finally catching some sleep. the big furry animal drifts into his own world.}
<D>__{travis (v.o.)(contd) ... who wouldn't take it any more, a man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth. here is ...}
