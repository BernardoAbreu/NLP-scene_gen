<L>__{exterior gottfried's cabin night 1965}
<A>__{harriet makes it out of the cabin in torn clothing, trying to get the belt around her neck off. her father can heard inside ranting something from the bible.}
<D>__{harriet v o i made it out of the house and down to the dock. he came staggering after me }
<A>__{gottfried emerges from the cabin and stumbles down the hill in pursuit of his almost naked daughter.}
<D>__{harriet v o i could never fight him off in a small room, but i was strong enough out in the open to deal with an old drunk.}
<A>__{as he comes onto the dock, she waits for the moment, and smashes him in the head with the flat side of an oar. it stuns and sends him toppling off the dock into the water. he surfaces, reaches for the dock planks. as he takes hold of them to claw himself from the water, she brings the sharp edge of the oar down, burying it in his head like an axe. he stares up her, uncomprehending. his fingers slide away from the dock. his body goes limp and sinks out of sight beneath the water.}
<D>__{harriet v o when it was finally over i looked up, and martin was standing there }
<A>__{she sees her brother up by the cabin looking down at her.}
<D>__{harriet v o with a little smile.}
