<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior apartment building (new york), hallway night}
<A>__{angle on apartment doorway. as it opens and an enormously sweet faced, elder woman steps out, bungled up against the cold turning back to call inside to the unseen love of her long life.}
<D>__{sweet faced woman i'm just going to get some flowers, dear. i will be back in twenty minutes. it's tulip season today. i'm so happy.}
<A>__{and now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness dissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that quickly she has reversed herself and re entered her apartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated. pov melvin udall in the hallway... well past 50... unliked, unloved, unsettling. a huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever met. right now all his considerable talent and strength is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the elevator door he holds open.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{come here, sweetheart... come on.}
<B>__{on dog}
<A>__{sniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting. melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the mutt who has ignores him.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{wanna go for a ride? okay, sweetie?}
<A>__{the dog lifts his leg at the precise moment melvin lunges and picks him up with a decisive heft so that dog urine squirts the hall wall for a second or two. the dog sensing a kindred spirit starts to growl and bark.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(a malevolent tone)}
<D>__{you've pissed your last floor, you dog eared monkey.}
<A>__{the dog takes a snap at melvin, but the man is much meaner and quicker than the dog he holds his snout shut with his hand and reaches for the door of the garbage chute.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i will bet you wish you were some sort of real dog now, huh? don't worry... this is new york. if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere, you know? you ugly, smelly fuck.}
<A>__{and with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and lets go. we hear a fading series of pleading "anoooos" from the dog fade to nothingness... as another apartment door opens emitting the loud sounds of a party and simon nye, early 30s. simon has been born and raised with gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man.}
