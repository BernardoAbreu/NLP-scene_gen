<D>__{my son thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<D>__{catherine, don't make an opera outta this. the three a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. you are an old goat, and she has an italian temper. she is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. catherine, you are no fool. you know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.}

<D>__{oh, catherine, please! don't make a tragedy. you come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{it pains that they should do this.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<D>__{i know it pains.}
<A>__{catherine turns and meanders a few steps. the stiff edge of mordant humor that has been her one defense against life has deserted her, and she is just a hurt old lady now.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{these are the worst years, i tell you.}
<A>__{she seats herself on an eames chair. on her right, a modern age lamp towers slimly. on her left is a modern age endtable with a modern age ashtray on it. the hardened muscles in her face suddenly slacken.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<P>__{(with deep compassion)}
<D>__{catherine, you are very dear to me. we have cried many times together. when my husband died, i would have gone insane if it were not for you. i ask you to come to my house, because i can make you happy. please come to my house.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{these are the worst years. i tell you. it's gonna happen to you. i'm afraida look inna mirror. i'm afraid i'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. i'm fifty six years old. what am i to do with myself? i have strength in my hands. i wanna cook. i wanna clean. i wanna make dinner for my children. am i an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? these are the terrible years, theresa! terrible years!}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}
<D>__{catherine, my sister...}
<A>__{catherine stares distraught at mrs. pilletti.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{it's gonna happen to you! it's gonna happen to you! what will you do if marty gets married?! what will you cook? what happen to alla children playing in alla rooms? where is the noise?! it is a curse to be a widow! a curse. what will you do if marty gets married?! what will you do?}
<A>__{she stares at mrs. pilletti, her deep eyes haggard and pained. mrs. pilletti stares back for a moment, then her own eyes close. catherine has hit home. catherine sinks back onto her chair, sitting stiffly, her arms on the thick armrests. mrs. pilletti sits hunched a little forward, her hands folded nervously in her lap.}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(continuing quietly)}
<D>__{i will put my clothes inna bag, and i will come to you tomorrow.}
<A>__{the two sisters, somber and silent, continue to just stare at one another.}
<B>__{the stardust ballroom. night}
<A>__{camera pans the crowd, picking up marty and clara dancing cheek to cheek on the crowded, darkened dance floor. the music rides over the top of the scene.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{you come up here often?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i was up here twice before. once with a friend of mine and once i came up alone. the last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{well, the last time i was up here, that's where i sat. i sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. i will never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. then i began to cry, and i had to get up and go home.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i cry a lot too. i'm a big cryer.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{this is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{oh, i cry all the time, any little thing. my brothers, my brother in laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy i am. well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. you get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. i know exactly how you feel. and i also want you to know i'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. so you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i'm having a very good time, too.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{so there you are. so i guess i'm not such a dog as i think i am.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{you're a very nice guy, and i don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i don't know either. i think i'm a very nice guy. i also think i'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.}
<A>__{clara smiles briefly at this.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{now i figure, two people get married, and they gonna live together forty, fifty years. so it's just gotta be more than whether they're good looking or not. you tell me you think you're not very good looking. my father was a really ugly man, but my mother adored him. she told me that she used to get so miserable sometimes, like everybody, you know? and she says my father always tried to understand. i used to see them sometimes when i was a kid, sitting in the living room, talking and talking, and i used to adore my old man, because he was so kind. that's one of the most beautiful things i have in my life, the way my father and mother were. and my father was a real ugly man. so it doesn't matter if you look like a gorilla. so you see, dogs like us, we ain't such dogs as we think we are.}
<A>__{they dance silently for a moment, cheeks pressed against each other.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i'm twenty nine years old. how old are you?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i'm thirty four.}
<A>__{ballroom, stairway. marty and clara are about halfway down the steps leading to the street entrance to the ballroom. clara has on a light summer coat. marty is about two steps ahead of her and has to keep turning his head to talk to her. he is in an elevated mood, intoxicated on a talking jag.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...you teach chemistry? that's funny. where? what school?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{benjamin franklin high school.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{benjamin franklin, where's that? brooklyn? i went to theodore roosevelt right up here on fordham road. it's right arounna corner from my house. i have a cousin who's a teacher. he teaches latin. he lives in chicago. he was studying to be a jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.}
<A>__{he has reached the street landing and waits for clara to catch up with him. they stand in front of the glass doors leading to the street.}

<C>__{marty}
<P>__{(prattling on)}
<D>__{i was pretty good in high school. i sound like a jerk now, but i was pretty good. i graduated with an eighty two average. that ain't bad. i was accepted at city college. i filled out the application and everything, but my old man died, so i hadda go to work. my best class was german. that was my first language. der, die, das des, der, des. there you are, i still remember...}
<A>__{he pushes the glass door open to...}
<B>__{the street outside the stardust ballroom.}
<A>__{as marty and clara emerge onto the sidewalk of west farms square, they pause again. it is about nine o'clock, and the busy street is brightly lit from the stores. passersby hurry on their way. the elevated subway rumbles over head intermittently.}
<C>__{marty}
<P>__{(chattering on)}
<D>__{you know what i was good at in high school? i was good in math. you know how long ago i graduated high school? june, nineteen thirty seven. holy cow! june, nineteen thirty seven! what is that? fifteen, seventeen years ago! holy cow! seventeen years ago! is that right? seventeen, that's right. where did it all go? i'm getting old. i'm gonna be thirty five november eighth. thirty five. wow. time goes on, boy.}
<A>__{he takes her arm, and they start walking.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{nineteen thirty seven... that's right. my old man died december, nineteen thirty seven.}
<B>__{sidewalk.}
<A>__{moving shot as they stroll toward the corner of jerome and burnside avenues.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{two o'clock in the morning he died. the doorbell rings, and i knew something was wrong right away. because my room is onna ground floor inna front, you see, and i got outta bed, and i answered the door...}
<A>__{camera holds as marty, caught in his story, stops and continues intently.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{there was mr. stern. he had a house down about a block from us. he moved out though. my old man, he used to play cards with him and some other old guys. he's a jewish feller. so he said, "is your mother home?" so i knew right away there was something wrong. i was only eighteen, exactly eighteen years old, just the month before. so i said, "is something wrong, mr. stern?" i was in my pajamas, you know? so he said, "marty, your father died." my father died right inna middle of playing cards, right at the table. he had a heart attack. he had low blood pressure, my old man. he used to faint a lot.}
<A>__{suddenly he looks at clara, rather startled.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{boy, am i talking, i never talked so much in my life. usually, everybody comes to me and tells me all their troubles. well, i'm gonna shut up now, and i'm gonna let you get a word in...}
<A>__{he takes her arm again, and they continue strolling toward the corner intersection in silence.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{seventeen years ago. what i been doing with myself all that time?... well, i'm talking again. i must be driving you crazy. mosta the time i'm with a girl, i can't find a word to say. well, i'm gonna shut up now. because i'm not like this usually. usually, i... well, here i go again.}
<A>__{they reach the corner intersection. camera holds on marty as he pauses again. he stares at clara, confused at his strange loquacity.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i can't shut my mouth... i'm on a jag, for pete's sake. you'd think i was loaded...}
<A>__{marty stares at clara, absolutely aghast at his inability to stop talking.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i can't stop talking! isn't this stupid?!}
<A>__{he stands there in the middle of the sidewalk with people moving past, back and forth. marty continues to stare at clara, his broad face widened by a foolish, confused smile. clara regards him affectionately.}
<C>__{marty}
<P>__{(with sudden sincerity)}
<D>__{you gotta real nice face, you know? it's really a nice face.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{thank you.}

<A>__{once a candy store, now a soda fountain where booths have been installed in the rear. one wall of the luncheonette in front is covered with magazines from floor to ceiling. it is a nice clean joint, brightly lit. several customers are occupying three of the four booths.}

<A>__{they sit opposite each other in the booth. each has a cup of coffee. marty is still talking, but now he is apparently telling a story so funny that he can hardly get the words out. the hilarity has communicated itself to clara. her eyes are burning with suppressed laughter. every now and then she has to gasp to control the bubbly giggling inside of her.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...so i'm inna kneeling position, and if you ever try shooting a bar inna kneeling position, you know what i mean. i can't holda steady position. i'm wavering back and forth...}
<A>__{he has to interrupt the narrative to control a seizure of giggles. clara wipes her eyes and catches her breath.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...so the guy next to me, he's shooting from the prone position, and he's cross eyed like i told you...}
<A>__{he can't go on. he has to stop and cover his face with one hand.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{so just then...}
<P>__{(stops to control himself again)}
<D>__{...so just then i hear five shots go off from the guy next to me...}
<A>__{it's too much for him. he lets out a sudden guffaw and instantly smothers it under shaking shoulders. clara hides her face in her hands and giggles desperately. some of the other people turn to look at them.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{so my target goes down, and a minute later, the flag comes up. i got five bulls eyes. this cross eyed guy next to me, he shot five bulls eyes into my target...}
<A>__{he stares at the girl, spent from laughter.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...so i said to the sergeant who was checking my score, "pretty good, eh, sarge? five bulls eyes? so this sergeant, he don't know what happened, he says, "say, that's all right, pilletti"...}
<A>__{he closes his eyes, shakes his head.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{oh, man. so that's what happened. that's how i got the reputation a being the best shot inna whole battalion... oh, man...}
<A>__{for a moment they seem to have controlled their laughter. they sit, shaking their heads, studying their fingers on the table in front of them. then slowly, marty begins to giggle again. it communicates itself to clara. in a moment they are hiding their faces in their hands, their shoulders shivering with laughter.}
<B>__{stardust ballroom.}
<A>__{close on angie. his eyes look slowly in every direction. camera pulls back disclosing angie standing on the fringe of the dance floor, head arched high, looking at the crowded dance floor. he starts back to the archway toward the lounge, looking over his shoulder.}

<A>__{he crosses to the men's room. men's room. angie comes into a momentarily empty room. angie goes the full length of the white tiled room, past the wash bowls, the long mirror, bending to look under the doors of the stalls. suddenly he calls out.}

<A>__{he waits for an answer...}
<B>__{grand concourse luncheonette.}
<A>__{close on marty and clara still in the booth, but two more cups of coffee have been set down in front of each of them. there are also two pie plates. clara has left half of her pie. also an empty pack of cigarettes, and another pack half gone. they are both smoking. marty is still talking, but the mood is no longer laughter. a pensive, speculative hush has fallen over them. they have been talking for hours, and they have reached the stage where you start tearing designs in the paper napkins.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{...when i got outta the army, clara, i was lost. i didn't know what i wanted to do. i was twenny five years old, what was i gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. i thought maybe i go to college under the g.i. biller rights, you know? but i wouldn't graduate till i was twenny eight, twenny nine years old, even if i made it in three years. and my brother freddie wanted to get married, and i had three unmarried sisters in an italian home, that's a terrible thing. and my kid brother nickie, he's a one got married last week. so i just went to pieces. i used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. my mother used to be so worried about me. my uncle mario come over one time. he offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. he got his own cab, you know. and god forgive me for what i'm gonna say now, but i used to thinka doing away with myself. i used to stand sometimes in the subway, and god forgive me what i'm going to say, i used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.}

<C>__{marty}
<D>__{well, the point is mr. gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to california in los angeles and live near their married daughter. because she's always writing them to come out there. so it's a nice little shop. i handle his books for him, so i know he has a thirty five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. the point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. there's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an a&p coming in, at least that's the rumor. of course, mosta his trade is strictly italian, but the younger italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old italian dishes so much. i mean, you gotta take that into account too.}

<D>__{it's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, marty.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{that's true. i do. but i'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. that's a big note to carry, because i have to give mr. gazzara a mortgage, and what i have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than i can make onna salary?}

<D>__{marty, i know you for three hours, but i know you're a good butcher. you're an intelligent, sensitive, decent man. i have a feeling about you like sometimes a kid comes in to see me for one reason or another. and some of these kids, marty, in my classes, they have so much warmth in them, so much capacity. and that's the feeling i get about you.}
<A>__{marty shuts his eyes, then opens them quickly, bows his head.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{if you were one of my students, i would say, "go ahead and buy the butcher shop. you're a good butcher."}
<A>__{clara pauses.}
<C>__{marty}
<P>__{(not quite trusting}
<D>__{the timbre of his}
<P>__{voice)}
<D>__{well, there's a lotta things i could do with this shop. i could organize my own supermarket. get a buncha neighborhood merchants together. that's what a lotta them are doing.}
<A>__{he looks up at her now.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{wadda you think?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i think anything you want to do, you'll do well.}
<A>__{tears begin to flood his eyes again. he quickly looks away. he licks his lips.}
<C>__{marty}
<P>__{(still looking down)}
<D>__{i'm catholic. are you catholic?}
<A>__{clara looks down at her hands.}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(also in a low voice)}
<D>__{yes, i am.}
<A>__{marty looks up at her.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i only got about three bucks on me now, but i just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of webster avenue. why don't we walk back to my house? i will run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i really should get home...}
<A>__{she twists in her seat and looks toward the back of the luncheonette.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{it's only a quarter of twelve. the clock's right over there.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i really should get home, i told my father... well, i suppose a little while longer. i wonder if there's any place around here i could put some makeup on...}
<A>__{marty considers this problem for a second, then leans out of the booth and calls out.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{hey, mac!}
<A>__{camera angles to include the proprietor of the luncheonette. he is sitting in one of the booths ahead reading the sunday mirror. he looks up toward marty.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{you gotta ladies' room around here?}
<C>__{proprietor}
<D>__{inna back.}
<C>__{marty}
<P>__{(to clara)}
<D>__{inna back.}
<A>__{clara smiles at this innocent gaucherie, then edges out of the booth, taking her purse with her.}
