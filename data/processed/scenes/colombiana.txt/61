<A>__{cat's eyes snap open. she sits up, moves with the efficiency and determination of someone who has not has a drop of alcohol. she takes a spoon from the coffee cup left for her, reaches into her mane of hair and extracts a small pin. she inserts the pin into the keyhole of the door, jiggles it. the door pops open. cat exits the cell, takes a broom leaning in the corner, and keeping her eye on the camera above the door, she slides along the wall, until she is just under the camera. she uses the broom handle to tilt the camera up just a bit.}
