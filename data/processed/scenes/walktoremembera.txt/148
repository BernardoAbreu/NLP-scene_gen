<L>__{interior kitchen 5 am}
<A>__{landon enters from outside. cynthia, still in her waitress uniform, is sitting at the table, drinking coffee.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{a late night or an early morning?}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(honest)}
<D>__{late night.}
<P>__{(smart aleck)}
<D>__{you?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{were you with jamie?}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{you sleeping with her?}
<A>__{landon doesn't dignify this question with an answer.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i was cleaning yesterday. i found this.}
<A>__{she pulls landon's life list from her pocket. landon is horrified. she reads it.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{scuba dive. touch a moon rock. learn to read egyptian hieroglyphs. go to college?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{she talking to you 'bout this stuff?}
<A>__{landon doesn't answer. she puts the list on the table. smoothes it. gently discouraging.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{honey, some of this is... farfetched. you take after me. people skills and common sense. good dependable qualities.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{i could take after dad, too.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{you do. you're handsome and charming.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{i meant he's a doctor.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{that's eight years of school and training after college. and all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{i could do it if i tried. even kelly thinks so.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{that'd be something.}
<A>__{she doesn't want to discourage him, but she wants him to be practical and realistic.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{but if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment }
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(angry now)}
<D>__{whatever my life is, i'm going to be friggin' sure i'm never disappointed }
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(honest)}
<D>__{disappointment isn't something anyone plans for.}
<P>__{(quieter)}
<D>__{it catches you by surprise.}
<A>__{long pause. they are both sorry to have raised their voices.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{have i told you how proud i am of you ?}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{mom, great. but what i want is for me to be proud of me.}
