<L>__{interior ronnie's bedroom night}
<A>__{on the television: there's an update on the carolina mall flasher. it says he has exposed himself to more girls. as the tv blares the headline, ronnie lays in his bed and watches. the images shine color on him, but ronnie is in his own world.}
<L>__{interior mall food court day}
<A>__{ronnie has the special elite task force assembled.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm disbanding the task force.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{hey, ronnie, that's crazy talk. are you cool?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no, i'm not cool, charles. in fact, shit is seriously fucked up. i've got to protect the whole mall by myself. now, i got you this fucking job, when are you going to stop being a little baby and do something for a change.}
<P>__{(mocking)}
<D>__{'i don't want to do anything hard. i just want to be a little bitch and brag about dropping out of college.' grow a fucking pair, will you, chucky?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i'm gonna go check the parking lot.}
<A>__{charles walks away.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, charles! i didn't mean it, buddy!}
<A>__{ronnie puts his head on the table.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you know, dennis, for the longest time i made this job my whole life. i looked at this mall as a kingdom and i looked at mark as the king. i thought of myself as the first knight and the customers, well, they were the peasants. i lived by an old code where one was bound by duty and honor. but now i don't know if i believe in that code anymore. i've lost my way. now i just feel like it's one big kingdom of shit. right now, i got half a mind just to let this whole place burn. burn it to the fucking ground!}
<A>__{dennis stares down at the desk. dennis takes off his hat and reveals that he has bleached white eminem hair underneath. next, he reaches under his collar and flips out a thin gold necklace. he kicks up his shoes and reveals the newest and freshest basketball kicks. this is the real dennis and for the first time ever, he speaks...}

<P>__{(high ghetto voice)}
<D>__{i've been waiting on you to get on my page this whole time. you look at this mall as a kingdom?! shit! i look at this place like a motherfucking jail sentence. you put on that uniform every morning, but what are you really protecting? commerce and corporations and money. well i say, fuck that! i'm a fucking outlaw and i'm going to live that until the day i die. now, i can show you the way, but you've got to be willing to accept it. so i'm gonna ask you now, ronnie. are you ready for a trip to the other side?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you're goddamn right i'm ready.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{alright then. let's party.}
