<L>__{exterior camp night}
<A>__{hunters go flying as the tent covered triceratops, its horns tearing through the canvas, rumbles across the camp. men shout in alarm, the triceratops bellows in anger and confusion, chaos reigns. in the crush of people running every which way, malcolm and sarah are swept off in one direction while nick is buffeted in another. they shout, but cannot be heard over the frey. the triceratops, blinded by the canvas shroud, stomps right through the fire in the middle of the camp and the tent bursts}
