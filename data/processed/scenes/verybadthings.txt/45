<D>__{...i am deeply in love with the woman i am about to marry and i look very much forward to raising a family and being a positive member of society. we promise, if you forgive us, we will never forget this tragedy and will try with all our powers to use it as a daily reminder that we are here on earth to do good not evil. let us go from this day forward with new purpose and spirit. you have given us a second chance and let us take that second chance and use it as fuel to feed our fires of productivity so that the spirits of the two we now bury live on forever in the good deeds and positive achievements we from this moment on shall make our life's work...}
