<A>__{the blow sends stu staggering. death and the other reapers look on in astonishment as the stained reaper does a bizarre dance across the floor, top half and bottom half moving independently. miraculously, he manages to right himself and regain his balance.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{now what were you saying? stu monkeybone}
<P>__{(in unison)}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{i'd like to have a word with you in private.}
<A>__{he stands and gestures toward a side room. the boys follow. the little hellhound scampers out from behind the desk... ...and grabs the hem of their shroud in its teeth! the boys keep on walking, but the shroud stays behind. somehow they go three or four steps before they realize they've been exposed. death jumps a foot in the air and shrieks. pandemonium erupts.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{impostors!! get 'em!!}
<A>__{the boys back toward the big window overlooking the trainyard. the reapers close in on them, brandishing their scythes.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{hypnos! that little twerp! he's the one who put you up to this!}
<A>__{with a screech, monkeybone leaps into the air, bounds over the heads and shoulders of the advancing reapers, and snatches the yellow e ticket pouch from the guy death gave it to. he bounds over a table and into stu's arms, with the precious pouch in hand! death lets out a great rattling bellow of rage. his features begin to jitter violently. his head explodes!!!}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{yowie.}
<A>__{nothing to lose at this pointerior with a crash, the boys dive through the big window overlooking the trainyard! the headless death gropes around blindly, waving to his assistant.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{head. head!!}
<A>__{the assistant opens a cabinet containing a half dozen identical heads. he pulls out a spare and screws it onto death's neck.}
