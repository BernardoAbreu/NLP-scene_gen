<L>__{interior by the entrance night}
<A>__{sweating hard, mannie is pressed back against a pole, shirt over his head. two nose ringed riot grrrls are drawing a christmas tree on his chest and stomach with a fat magic marker. looking over at the entrance, he watches some gapsters move past the bouncers. and behind them,}
<B>__{todd gaines.}
<A>__{mannie's drugged eyes go wide with panic. he hunches down. gaines starts looking around the edge of the crowd. mannie works his way into the mob. strobes fire overhead. ronna dances on, oblivious... gaines circles, searching... mannie fights his way through the outer ring of moshers... through the crowd, we see gaines looking in... mannie grabs ronna... she smiles, tries to kiss him... he yells in her ear. he has to repeat himself... she looks back over her shoulder... a space in the crowd... she sees gaines. he sees her. the music stops. dead silence. ronna and gaines trade stares for what feels like an eternity, until suddenly... the music blasts back, harder than ever. like a shot, ronna and mannie are out of there. gaines plows through the crowd, coming after them.}
