<A>__{lila is halfway up the stairs. as she climbs she is startled by the creaks and groans of the old wood of the steps. she steps more carefully. camera remains at foot of stair, tilting up as lila climbs. she pauses at the head of the stair. the door on her right, which opens into the mother's room, is closed. to her left is another door, half open. directly before her is a third door, closed. she holds a long moment, trying to picture in her mind which room would look out on the front of the house, decides, chooses the correct door, the one on her right. she goes to it, knocks lightly.}
