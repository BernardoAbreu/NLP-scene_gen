<A>__{suddenly a man approaches the trash can with a steaming cup of coffee. the binoculars readout says "warning! extremely hot."}
<C>__{gru }
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{oh no. that's not good.}
<A>__{the man goes to throw the coffee in the trash and we see gru's legs pop out from beneath the can. the man looks confused and tries again. gru dodges and takes off running. the man chases after him. gru accidentally knocks into a bent over woman's rear end. insulted, she turns around, sees the man with the coffee, and slaps him across the face. unfortunately, gru doesn't see the escalator ahead and goes tumbling down the moving stairs. crash! bang! clang! finally, gru pops out of the trash can and lands at the bottom of the escalator with a thud! flat on his face, he hears a familiar voice call out.}
