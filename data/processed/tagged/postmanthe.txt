<L>__{exterior desert landscape (utah) day}
<A>__{jagged mountains defy a dark, foreboding sky. we hear plodding hooves, creaking leather. a lone wanderer appears. wearing a long coat and a battered hat, he carries a bolt action carbine. his name forgotten, history remembers him simply as the postman. his laden pack mule, bill, brays, as they pass a battered sign: "the great salt lake marina." they start down a slope and begin to cross a...}
<B>__{dry lake bed}
<A>__{a bizarre, wind swept sight. dozens of boats resting lee to on the dry, cracked earth. it's like god pulled the plug. rusty mooring chains snake their way around house boats, ski boats and a cabin cruiser or two.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{the last of the great cities died when my father was a child. another victim of yet another war. the plagues followed. and the terrors. the living hid themselves away in tiny hamlets in hopes of surviving whatever new madness conspired to rob them of the little that remained. the earth itself had fallen prey to chaos. for three years a dirty snow fell that even summer could not erase. the ocean was barren. poisoned. near death.}
<A>__{as the postman continues to cross, the camera pulls back. he's soon lost in the massive vista.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{sixteen long years passed before the great lungs started working again. my father said it was as if the ocean breathed a great sigh of relief...}
<A>__{a rumble of thunder. rain begins to fall. the earth just sucks it up at first, but it's coming hard. rivulets run. puddles form. we begin to get the feeling that soon these boats will be tugging at the mooring chains once again. track a rivulet as it runs, filling up a depression in the sand. and then, running to fill another in a series of depressions. they make a pattern we recognize as man's footprints these tracks may already be days old as they fill with rain water. then, the sound of light, padded footfalls. a lion enters frame. lean, hungry and dangerous, the big cat has been tracking this man. he lets out a low, disappointed growl. the rain has foiled his dinner plans for now.}
<L>__{exterior highway on ramp (utah) day}
<A>__{a bullet ridden sign reads: "u.s. 84 north." the postman leads bill down a barren 4 lane. weeds poke up through the asphalt. the rusting hulk of a car rests in the median, covered in a tangle of purple wisteria. the postman plucks a flower. he sticks it into a buttonhole and continues. bill brays woefully. in answer:}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i don't know. and if you ask me again, i'm going to slug you.}
<A>__{they near a sign: "thank you for visiting utah." the postman waves, shouts to the sign as he passes it.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{it's been fun, hasn't it, kids?}
<P>__{(to the sign)}
<D>__{you're welcome!}
<L>__{exterior 4 lane (idaho) billboard day}
<A>__{bill tugs up weeds as the postman is climbing up a ladder on a highway that razor cuts the plains to the horizon. above, the postman sands atop a billboard catwalk. he references a tattered road atlas, scans the horizon through binoculars with one broken lens. he pauses at a union 76 ball just visible above the tree line.}
<L>__{exterior highway travel stop (idaho) day}
<A>__{a 76 station and the remains of a howard johnson's. alert, carbine in hand, the postman leads in the mule. rusting cars sag on flattened tires. there's a stripped fire engine, its cracked hoses leading to the hojo foundation which bristles with burned timbers. bill stops to drink out of a stream. the postman swats at him with his hat.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{damnit, bill, you know i need to check it first!}
<A>__{bill hangs his head. the postman digs through his pack. he removes an old tupperware container and replaces its contents a tiny sheaf of litmus papers and several small bottles with stream water. he adds a few drops from each bottle. swirls it around. then dips a tiny strip of paper into the water. the paper turns a vivid purple. the postman is dubious.}

<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you ain't picky, bill. i like that about you.}
<A>__{the postman takes his carbine and a burlap sack and crosses to the 76 station. an old extension ladder on the ground. the pole holding up the 76 ball has a 30 degree bend in it, like someone once tried to pull it over. beyond the 76 ball, the sun sets but we here in the}

<A>__{before. the postman tries the station door. locked. smiling ironically, he steps in through the blown out window.}
<L>__{interior 76 station office day}
<A>__{a shambles. the postman kicks around the table. he finds a few beat up cds, flips through them. reads the label.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{'running on empty'? tell me about it.}
<A>__{tossing it, he turns, stops. there, resting on a pile of trash is a bashed in portable tv. the postman smiles.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{hey, bill! we got tv! 147 channels. everything from jesus to 'jeopardy'.}
<A>__{he steps over, switches on the set. nothing happens, but the postman pretends just the same. he mimics static, then:}

<A>__{the postman stops suddenly. click.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{we interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you the second civil war... well, shit.}
<A>__{the postman stares at the blank screen a moment. there's a sudden, panicked rustling from behind the service manager's desk. the postman wheels around, raises the carbine.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i don't want any trouble... i bet you don't either... let's just call it a draw, okay?}
<A>__{sudden movement. the postman shouts in surprise as a doe dashes out from behind the desk. scared, it bounds back and forth between the walls. then freezes in the corner. the postman sighs in relief, lowers the carbine.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{look out, bill!}
<A>__{the doe bolts for the window and runs right into bill. bill has a conniption fit. investigating further, the postman spots a cigarette machine. the front glass is smashed and all the slots are empty. but he looks down to the lock at the bottom. it's intact. he pulls a crowbar from the sack, crouches by the machine and digs the pry into a seam and pulls. the panel bursts open to reveal four half open cartons of cigarettes. he doesn't believe it for a second. then:}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i'm rich.}
<L>__{exterior 76 station night}
<A>__{embers of a campfire glow. the postman is asleep, the carbine in reach. bill brays and nervously stamps his hooves. the postman reaches for the carbine only to find the barrel of a shotgun pointed in his face. three bandits! hard eyed and ugly. one, barely 20, is mostly just ugly. the postman looks down the barrels of a shotgun, a rifle and a revolver. the lead bandit kicks the carbine out of reach.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i'm just passing through. i don't mean anyone any harm.}
<P>__{(re: stream)}
<D>__{water's good.}
<A>__{the lead bandit pokes at the postman's shoulder with the muzzle of his rifle. the postman knows why.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i'm not a holnist.}
<A>__{the lead bandit pokes again. harder. the postman opens his shirt, reveals his bare left shoulder.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{okay?}
<A>__{they just stare at him, none saying a word. creepy.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i'm headed for a town called st. rose. somewhere west of portland.}
<C>__{lead bandit}
<D>__{portland's under twenty feet of water.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{well, i heard different.}
<C>__{lead bandit}
<D>__{you mouthin' me?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{no, it's just that it's hard to get good information.}
<A>__{the third bandit, a hulking brute, has been quiet.}
<C>__{hulking bandit}
<D>__{he is mouthin' you; i say we kill him.}
<C>__{lead bandit}
<D>__{don't be in such a rush, martin.}
<P>__{(back to the postman)}
<D>__{now i see a pack mule over there, but i don't see no packs.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{this is all i got.}
<C>__{lead bandit}
<D>__{oh... kill him, martin.}
<A>__{the hulking bandit, raises his shotgun. the butt end. he's going to bludgeon the postman to death.}
<C>__{the postman}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{okay! my stuff's up there!}
<A>__{the 76 ball is twenty feet above the ground. in the gloom you can just see a hole has been punched through the side.}
<D>__{bandit #20 what do you got in there?}
<A>__{the lead bandit swats bandit #20 upside the head.}
<C>__{lead bandit}
<D>__{shut up.}
<P>__{(to postman)}
<D>__{what do you got in there?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{dried peas. beef jerky. cigarettes.}
<C>__{all three bandits}
<D>__{cigarettes!}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{sure. there's the ladder. bandit #20 maybe he's got it booby trapped.}
<A>__{the lead bandit is about to smack bandit #20 again then he sees the logic out of it. the postman shakes his head, but isn't that convincing.}
<C>__{lead bandit}
<D>__{you go up and get it.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior 76 ball dawn}
<A>__{the ladder set against the bent pole. prodded by a shotgun, the postman climbs, disappears through the hole and into the tilting 76 ball.}
<L>__{interior 76 ball dawn}
<A>__{full of the postman's earthly possessions. trick is, how to save them and his life at the same time. he spies an old wrench: remnant of an attempt to remove the rusty bolts holding the ball in place. an idea begins to take shape.}
<C>__{lead bandit }
<D>__{just you start tossing those cigarettes down!}
<B>__{bandits}
<A>__{there's no answer. the bandits eye each other nervously.}
<D>__{bandit #20 maybe he fell asleep.}
<L>__{76 ball}
<A>__{the postman grabs the wrench, starts working one of the last two rusted bolts. as it starts to give...}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{it's going to take a second. i got my stuff bolted in.}
<B>__{bandits}
<A>__{the lead bandit takes a cautious step back.}
<C>__{lead bandit}
<D>__{put some buckshot through it, martin. just to hurry him up.}
<C>__{hulking bandit}
<D>__{i only got three shells left.}
<C>__{lead bandit}
<D>__{so use his gun.}
<A>__{the hulking bandit picks up the carbine and aims. click. it isn't loaded. the hulking bandit tosses the gun aside, pulls a knife from his boot. grimly, he begins to climb.}
<L>__{76 ball}
<A>__{cramped, the postman's busy at the base of the ball, trying to unscrew the last remaining bolt. it won't budge.}
<B>__{ladder}
<A>__{the hulking bandit has only a few more rungs to go.}
<L>__{76 ball}
<A>__{no good. time's up. the postman starts rocking the pole.}
<B>__{ladder}
<A>__{the hulking bandit has reached the opening feels the rocking motion. hangs on.}
<L>__{76 ball}
<A>__{knife in hand, the hulking bandit looks inside. at that instant, the postman rocks the pole one more time. the rusty bolt is not enough to keep the ball's full weight in place. it pops. the ball is frozen for an instant before going with the pole's tilt.}
<B>__{ladder}
<A>__{the 76 ball drops off the pole, rolling over the hulking bandit's back and down the ladder's incline. the other bandits dive clear as the 76 ball hurtles past.}
<B>__{the postman}
<A>__{whips head over heels as the ball speeds away.}
<B>__{field}
<A>__{the 76 ball launches off a dirt berm, but soon comes to a stop as it slams into an old utility pole and bursts apart. fighting the vertigo, the postman staggers to his feet.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{bill!}
<A>__{bill bolts from the station as the lead bandit raises the rifle and fires at the postman. losing balance, the postman lands on his butt just before a bullet splinters the utility pole above his head. wobbly, he tries to gather his packs. the bandits charge, quickly closing the ground, but bill is there first. holding as much as he can, the postman heaves himself over bill's back. as the mule gallops away, the lead bandit aims the rifle. he's got the postman in his sights. he's about to fire when bandit #20 stands up into the shot. he's got a fistful of cigarettes in each hand and he's laughing like a hyena!}
<D>__{bandit #20 we're rich!}
<L>__{exterior overlook hill (idaho) day}
<A>__{the postman sits on a rock, holding bill's halter so the mule must face him. they are in the midst of an argument.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{it's true, we haven't done this in a while, but it's like riding a bicycle. now, open your mouth.}
<A>__{the postman pries his mouth open. taking a toothbrush, he tends to bill's teeth, then gives him an appraising look.}
<B>__{bill brays.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i know the rule. it's my rule! avoid civilization at all costs. but we gotta eat, don't we?}
<P>__{(as bill brays again)}
<D>__{what are you so worried about, bill? all you gotta do is stand there. i'm the one with all the lines.}
<A>__{the postman leads the mule down the hill toward the town far below. making his case all the while even as bill brays in protest.}
<L>__{exterior village square (idaho) day}
<A>__{a patch of mud. in the center of the square fifty townspeople stand before a plank stage where the postman wraps up a performance of macbeth. he plays it with a mis remembered gusto the people enjoy. children especially are enamored. a heavily muscled man, woody, lingers on the fringe of the crowd watching the postman with inscrutable intensity.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{they said, 'fear not, macbeth, 'til birnam wood comes to dunsinane'!}
<A>__{he looks off stage for someone, but no one appears.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i said, birnam wood comes to dunsinane!}
<A>__{bill trots on stage. covered with twigs, bill is birnam wood. he brays lustily. the audience laughs in delight. the children clap. only woody seems unaffected. the postman grabs two wooden swords he knows it's going well.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{arm, arm yourselves! if the witch's words are true, there'll be no running or hiding here!}
<A>__{shaking off the twigs, bill takes one of the swords in his mouth. the two of them dash back and forth pretending to fight off an imaginary attack. finally, the postman looks out at the audience, remembers the words the best he can.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day after that. out brief candle! life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts his hour upon the stage and is heard no more. it's a tale told by a moron. full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.}
<P>__{(waves sword)}
<D>__{but blow, wind! come wrack! at least we'll die with the harness off our back!}
<A>__{the audience erupts in applause. but woody stands still as stone. the postman takes a bow. even bill does a cross legged dip. knowing when to quit, he steps off the stage to many hearty handshakes. woody watches his every move. mrs. thompson, one of the town's leaders, steps up. she's accompanied by crotchety old curmudgeon larry.}
<C>__{mrs. thompson}
<D>__{the children have never heard shakespeare before.}
<C>__{the postman}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{they still haven't.}
<A>__{the curmudgeon is still clapping.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{thanks. you're very nice.}
<C>__{curmudgeon larry}
<D>__{i'm clapping because you stink.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i don't think you understand how it works.}
<C>__{curmudgeon larry}
<D>__{when i was young, i tried to be an actor. i was awful. but now i won't die thinking i was the worst one.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i'm glad i could help.}
<C>__{mrs. thompson}
<D>__{larry, stop it.}
<P>__{(to the postman)}
<D>__{you were very good.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{good enough to get something to eat?}
<A>__{before she can answer, a sentry cries...}
<C>__{sentry}
<D>__{holnists! holnists are coming!}
<A>__{all eyes look down the road leading into town. a raiding party of holnist cavalry are on their way in. mrs. thompson sees the postman's concern.}
<C>__{mrs. thompson}
<D>__{it's okay. we give them food and supplies. all the towns do. man #1 they hardly kill anyone lately. just take a woman sometimes.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{well, i'd just as soon not give them anything of mine. let's find the back door, bill.}
<A>__{the postman gathers his stuff, slings packs onto bill. the forty holnists in orange and black uniforms ride in. they're armed with mostly pistols and rifles. some carry bows, knives, spear guns and swords. on their bare shoulders, branded into the flesh the number "8." out front, always leading by example is, general bethlehem. tough, smart, merciless with style. commander of the united clans of holn. nothing escapes his eye. a little behind him is the mysteriously silent colonel getty, second in command. the postman, finished packing, begins to move from building to building careful not to attract any attention.}
<C>__{bethlehem }
<D>__{what are you doing there?}
<A>__{the postman freezes, turns, is relieved to find bethlehem's not talking to him at all. the general looks down from his horse at children playing an impromptu game of "birnam wood." the children stop, stare at their feet. bethlehem affects a "kindly" smile to accompany his gentler tone.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{i said, what are you doing?}
<A>__{meantime, the postman continues his surreptitious escape. the mayor hurries forward to greet bethlehem.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{it's just a game, general bethlehem. something they saw in a play. no harm in it.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{a play?}
<P>__{(to kids)}
<D>__{show me. it's all right, children, show me.}
<A>__{one brave boy finds his voice, barely.}
<C>__{brave boy}
<D>__{arm, arm yourselves! no running from the witches!}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{shakespeare, is it? well, i'm sorry i missed it.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{you should know, sir, we haven't nearly stocked the game we thought we would.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{really? but you had time for a play?}
<A>__{head down, the postman makes for "the back way." but it's guarded by three daunting holnist soldiers. no getting by them. the postman does a quick 180, goes back the way he came. bethlehem looks at the frightened townsfolk.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{i'm taking three conscripts from each town. they will have the honor of serving in the holnist army until such time as i see fit.}
<P>__{(to mayor)}
<D>__{three men. you suppose you could do that?}
<A>__{the mayor nods in acquiescence. bethlehem looks to a holnist officer. the officer, idaho, steps up and addresses the town.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{all men between 15 and 50 and of suitable ethnic foundation are required to show themselves now.}
<A>__{the holnist soldiers fan out, prodding any likely or unwilling candidates forward. the postman is now walking behind bethlehem. some of the townspeople cast him a furtive glance as he makes his way toward the open courtyard and, ultimately, the gate out of town. three conscripts are hustled before bethlehem. he looks over the first woody. smells him. not much of a decision here.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{acceptable.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{acceptable, captain!}
<A>__{the second a thin teenager. bethlehem feels his arm, turns his head from side to side.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{you'll need to put some meat on, but i like an impressionable mind. acceptable.}
<A>__{the third an innocuous man. or so we think. bethlehem stares hard at his olive skin, traces a finger over the bump on the man's nose.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{mongoloid. unacceptable.}
<A>__{soldiers shove the man back into the crowd. the brave boy that was playing birnam wood allows himself a tiny smile when he sees that the postman might make it.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{i want pure blood. someone like...}
<A>__{bethlehem notes the boy, turns to see the object of his attention, and spots the postman leaving out the front gate.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{that man.}
<A>__{idaho and another soldier are on it. the postman tries to back away as the two dismount and come toward him.}

<B>__{idaho}
<A>__{tracking. he sees a dribble of fresh blood. he touches it with his fingers and smiles. he cocks his head at movement to his left. smiling, hefting his pistol, idaho moves in. more shuffling. just ahead. he's got him now.}

<A>__{a chilling rain drills down, washing across an old forest road. covered with undergrowth and dotted with saplings, nothing's been down here in years. blue lipped and shivering, his clothes torn and soaked, the postman trudges along. he tries to rub some warmth back into his numbed limbs, but a coughing spell wracks his body. he trudges forward, shoes heavy with freezing mud. he's made his escape, but he won't last the night if he doesn't find some shelter. an unnatural shape ahead, just off the road. square. he cautiously pulls back a few branches. an old, rusted jeep with faded u.s. government markings. its hood buried under the dirt of an old mud slide. the postman stoops to look through the passenger side window, comes face to face with death. a skeleton sits inside, the skull grinning against the glass facing the postman. but the postman doesn't jump back. he just stares. the two heads meet halfway as the postman's face is reflected on the glass, superimposed over the skull. a hypothermic shiver wracks his body. the postman tries the door, but it won't budge. the other side of the jeep is buried. but seeing that the windshield is partly smashed, he clears away the debris, peels back the spider webbed safety glass and climbs inside.}

<A>__{the postman turns the envelope over in his palm. a tiny tooth falls out. the postman considers it. this suddenly isn't so amusing. he puts it back in the envelope. shoving mail sacks aside, he climbs in the back. burrowing in, he pulls the sacks back, covering himself with a blanket of mail. getting warmer already, he regards the skeleton a beat as the rain drums on the roof.}

<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{'dear irene. sorry i haven't written. everything's so crazy. the strange weather. the food shortages. that farmer nathan holn causing all that trouble. it's hard to understand. david's home from the army. the war was over before he even got there. thank god for that. he's still my baby no matter how big he gets. we're going to miss you for christmas, but maybe next year. all our love. donna.'}

<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{yes, there is! if there are dogs in this town, you have to leash them while i'm here!}
<A>__{only the postman laughs. no one else reacts. briscoe watches dubiously from the wall as the people surround the postman and sweep him through the gates and into town. one couple watches the postman closely as he makes his way into town. she is abby a sweet faced, pretty woman. her husband, michael, is a decent looking sort, tall and strong.}

<D>__{used to be john stevens, but i changed it on account of i want to drive cars.}
<A>__{hoping to impress, ford reaches into a pocket, pulls out a worn, creased flyer for a "ford lincoln mercury" dealership. ford finds the postman just staring at him, waiting for the uniform he's still got in his hand. embarrassed, ford quickly hands it over.}

<D>__{what?}
<A>__{the boy just stares.}
<C>__{the postman}
<P>__{(re: the cap)}
<D>__{this?}

<D>__{almost fits.}
<A>__{the boy's eyes go wide with wonder. his stock's gone up}

<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{that's not a toy, honey. that's very important. give it back.}

<C>__{abby}
<D>__{we've been trying to have a baby for three years. we can't on account of michael had the bad mumps when he was twelve. so we need a body father. we could ask a man here, but it could cause trouble. i've seen it happen. things go okay until the woman starts to show. then it can be bad. but you'll only be around once in awhile with the mail.}

<D>__{i got to get out of here.}
<L>__{exterior pine view night}
<A>__{the postman moves through town. the streets are deserted. he's got his pack on, his mailbag. he passes a 7 11 converted to a blacksmith shop. there's a horse tethered to the railing in front of it. he grins; maybe he's going to make it out of here after all. as he starts to move toward the horse...}
<C>__{old man }
<D>__{it's right around the corner.}

<C>__{old man}
<D>__{what you're looking for.}
<A>__{the old man winks knowingly, then heads inside. as the postman turns the corner, he finds himself in front of the post office. an old brick building. chiseled in the granite facing: "united states post office. est. 1884."}

<D>__{i knew you'd come here.}
<C>__{the postman}

<D>__{could be anywhere. anytime. only another postman can make you a postman.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{kinda like vampires, right?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{something like that. you have to be sworn in.}

<A>__{the postman smiles in relief as ford lowers the revolver and starts to hand the weapon over. forgotten for an instant, bethlehem makes a last, wild lunge, grabs ford's gun. as bethlehem aims at the postman, a shot rings out. hit in the chest, bethlehem blinks in amazement before he falls to the ground, dying. getty has shot him.}

<L>__{exterior st. rose day}
<A>__{a beach town. no wall, no sentries, just cottages lining a dozen sand swept streets. a crowd has gathered to hear the postman's daughter, hope, mid thirties, speak. beside her, a bearded, 52 year old ford in his postmaster's uniform. they stand before a large, tarp draped statue.}

<A>__{she unveils the statue: we've seen this before. it's the postman on his horse, low slung in the saddle, leaning down to pluck the letter from the little boy's hand. there's an older man in the audience who seems especially moved by the statue. there's a younger man beside him.}
