<L>__{interior city room enquirer building day }
<A>__{the front half of the second floor constitutes one large city room. despite the brilliant sunshine outside, very little of it is actually getting into the room because the windows are small and narrow. there are about a dozen tables and desks, of the old fashioned type, not flat, available for reporters. two tables, on a raised platform at the end of the room, obviously serve the city room executives. to the left of the platform is an open door which leads into the sanctrum. as kane and leland enter the room, an elderly, stout gent on the raised platform, strikes a bell and the other eight occupants of the room all men rise and face the new arrivals. carter, the elderly gent, in formal clothes, rises and starts toward them.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{welcome, mr. kane, to the "enquirer." i am herbert carter.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{thank you, mr carter. this is mr. leland.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(bowing)}
<D>__{how do you do, mr. leland?}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(pointing to the standing reporters)}
<D>__{are they standing for me?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{i thought it would be a nice gesture the new publisher }
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{ask them to sit down.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{you may resume your work, gentlemen.}
<P>__{(to kane)}
<D>__{i didn't know your plans and so i was unable to make any preparations.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i don't my plans myself.}
<A>__{they are following carter to his raised platform.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, i haven't got any. except to get out a newspaper.}
<A>__{there is a terrific crash at the doorway. they all turn to see bernstein sprawled at the entrance. a roll of bedding, a suitcase, and two framed pictures were too much for him.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{oh, mr. bernstein!}
<A>__{bernstein looks up.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{if you would come here a moment, please, mr. bernstein?}
<A>__{bernstein rises and comes over, tidying himself as he comes.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{mr. carter, this is mr. bernstein. mr. bernstein is my general manager.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(frigidly)}
<D>__{how do you do, mr. bernstein?}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{you've got a private office here, haven't you?}
<A>__{the delivery wagon driver has now appeared in the entrance with parts of the bedstead and other furniture. he is looking about, a bit bewildered.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(indicating open}
<D>__{door to left of}
<P>__{platform)}
<D>__{my little sanctum is at your disposal. but i don't think i understand }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i'm going to live right here.}
<P>__{(reflectively)}
<D>__{as long as i have to.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{but a morning newspaper, mr. kane. after all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day except for the business offices }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{that's one of the things i think must be changed, mr. carter. the news goes on for twenty four hours a day.}
