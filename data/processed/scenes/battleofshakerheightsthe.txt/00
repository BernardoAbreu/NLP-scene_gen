<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior forest day}
<B>__{distant gun and mortar fire}
<A>__{muffled by the wet green forest. the very earth seems to tremble.}
<B>__{a rabbit}
<A>__{darts out of a log, lifts itself on its hind legs and sniffs the air.}
<B>__{lobbed grenade explodes}
<A>__{voices and shouts, closer now, mix with the rumbling war sounds in a veritable symphony of violence and confusion. a dead american gi lays splayed out, careless in death. a pair of soldiers flash among the trees, running hunched over and low, and disappear into the gray blooms of smoke. for a moment the forest takes a breath. nothing but trembling leaves. then the rattle of a jeep coming closer in fits and starts, grinding through low gears. a willys mb appears, crashing through the undergrowth. it's driven by private first class kelly ernswiler. eighteen, if that. not much meat on him. his insignias indicate he's in the 29th infantry. his face might be attractive, under other conditions. he pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his m41 standard issue field jacket.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{where the hell are those krauts?}
<A>__{to give himself courage, he sings tommy dorsey's "i will be seeing you [in all the old familiar places]" while maneuvering the jeep through the bushes and rocks. he drives straight for a fallen log, guns the engine and tries to go over it. the jeep's front wheels catch on the log. the back tires spin. kelly gets out. takes off his m1 combat helmet and wipes his face. assesses the situation. he grabs a branch. jams it under the wheel, trying to lever the jeep free. when the stutter of a nearby machine gun startles him. the branch snaps against kelly's weight. he slips and falls in the mud.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{determined, he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on foot through the forest.}
