<L>__{int incubation room, laboratory day}
<A>__{sunlight pours through the windows. ellie sits with her head in hands. she looks around and wanders the lab. notices a drawer, slides it open. x rays. she shuffles through, finds some marked: freda. ellie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station. she studies the x ray. she looks up in surprise. studies it again. the viewing light is snapped off. ellie looks again. wu stands there.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{who gave you permission }
<A>__{ellie attacks back.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i'm here to investigate this park. and there's}
<A>__{plenty you haven't told me.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{that's absurd.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{these bones aren't fully formed.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{you're qualified to interpret x rays of living dinosaurs? i doubt it. it took me many months to learn.}
<C>__{y}
<D>__{i will tell you something else, freda isn't an adult, just a huge juvenile.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{you're making a lot of assumptions here.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{right. what the hell is going on, wu?}
<A>__{they stare at each other in the bright sunlight.}
<C>__{hammond }
<D>__{growth hormones.}
<A>__{the two swing around. hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{she didn't have a right to explore my lab.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{let's not argue, wu, we have a serious problem.}
<P>__{(to}
<A>__{ellie)}
<D>__{these animals don't last. there is a regularity, a predictability about when they die. it's always ... very young. we don't know why. given time, i'm sure wu will figure it out. it's just ...}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{just some adjustment in the code is required.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{but there are deadlines. the park opens next summer. and it requires full grown specimens. so wu uses growth hormones to achieve the desired size in a short amount of time. but they all keep dying and we don't know how to stop it.}
<A>__{ellie and wu stare at hammond. he steps forward. the light is so hot behind him that his appearance is like an apparition.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i was going to tell you all this myself, dr. sattler, after gennaro stopped breathing down my neck. that's why i wanted you and dr. grant}
<A>__{here on my}
<D>__{island you have to help me keep the dinosaurs alive. won't you please help me?}
