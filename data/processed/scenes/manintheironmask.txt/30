<L>__{interior palace the hall of mirrors}
<A>__{the hall is alive with glorious light, fiery gold frames surrounding silvery mirrors blazing with reflections. musicians line the length of the hall, and when louis and michelle appear at the far doorway they begin playing for the couple as they parade past. michelle is speechless, as louis smiles at her awed innocence.}
<L>__{interior royal dining room night}
<A>__{louis leads michelle into a towering room surrounding a magnificent table, decked out with candelabra and sumptuous delicacies set for just two.}
<B>__{the dinner}
<A>__{louis and michelle sit opposite each other, attended by a dozen servants. michelle stares at her plate.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{the food doesn't please you?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{it's lovely. it's just...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{this is more than you are used to. your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead. you have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption. don't look so surprised, kings know such things.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{i... we are humble people...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{wait, no! do not be ashamed. the straits of your family need not be permanent. it is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{you would do that, your majesty?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{my dear, i've already done it.}
<A>__{she rushes to him and throws herself at his knees, weeping in gratitude. louis smiles, as if embarrassed.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{please, darling, that isn't necessary. we are friends now. mademoiselle needs wine!}
<A>__{a servant quickly approaches with wine; the goblet at michelle's place is quite large, and he pours it full.}
