<A>__{elinor and marianne walk on. suddenly, marianne stops.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{she indicates a spot on the ground but elinor can see nothing and is momentarily alarmed. marianne gazes at the ground and breathes in deeply.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{there i fell, and there i first saw willoughby.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{poor willoughby. he will always regret you.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{but does it follow that, had he chosen me, he would have been content?}
<A>__{elinor looks at marianne, surprised.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{he would have had a wife he loved but no money and might soon have learned to rank the demands of his pocket book far above the demands of his heart.}

<D>__{do you compare your conduct with his?}

<D>__{no. i compare it with what it ought to have been. i compare it with yours.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{our situations were very different.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{my illness has made me consider the past. i saw in my own behaviour nothing but imprudence and worse. i was insolent and unjust to everyone }
<A>__{elinor tries to stem the flow but marianne continues.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{ but you you i wronged above all. only i knew your heart and its sorrows but even then i was never a grain more compassionate. i brought my illness upon myself i wanted to destroy myself. and had i succeeded, what misery should i have caused you?}
<A>__{elinor embraces her. they stand with their arms round one another in silence for a moment. then marianne breaks away and speaks with great good humour and energy.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i shall mend my ways! i shall no longer worry others nor torture myself. i am determined to enter on a course of serious study colonel brandon has promised me the run of his library and i shall read at least six hours a day. by the end of the year i expect to have improved my learning a very great deal.}
