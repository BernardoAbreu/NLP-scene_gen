<L>__{exterior open field}
<A>__{full shot ray's car sudden quiet at the cut. we are looking at ray's car in profile, parked in the middle of a deserted field. from offscreen we hear the sound of a shovel biting into earth. we track laterally down the car, along the beam of its headlights, to finally frame ray as he climbs out of the shallow grave he has just finished digging. he plants the shovel and walks back to the car.}

<B>__{back to high shot}
<A>__{as ray shovels, marty is moving under the loose dirt. a faint, inarticulate noise comes from the grave. almost imperceptibly, marty's right arm starts to rise.}
<B>__{low shot from inside the grave}

<A>__{as he straightens up and stands motionless, expressionless, watching marty, making no attempt to get out of the way.}

<B>__{low shot ray}
