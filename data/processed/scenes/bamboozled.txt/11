<L>__{interior dunwitty's office morning}
<A>__{delacroix enters his corner office, which has huge action photos of ali, jordan, griffey, tyson, aaron and jabbar on his walls, it is also decorated with african art throughout.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{office. dunwitty looks at the floor to ceiling windows overlooking mid town manhattan.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{do you know what c.p. time is?}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{c.p. time is colored people's time. the stereotypical belief that negroes are always late. that negroes have no sense of time time except when it comes to music or dance.}
<A>__{they both laugh.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{let's sit down over there.}
<A>__{dunwitty and delacroix sit on the sofa.}
<C>__{dunwitty }
<D>__{i'm sorry about my blowup but i have to have a whipping boy every meeting.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i understand. but again, in all honesty i was not informed.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{forget it. i believe you're my most creative person i've got on staff. you're hip. you know what's happening. i got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.}
<A>__{delacroix doesn't join him in his laughter because he doesn't know how to take that comment or where dunwitty is headed with it.}
<C>__{dunwitty }
<D>__{i understand black culture. i grew up around black people all my life. if the truth be told i probably know "niggers" better than you, monsieur delacroix. please don't get offended by my use of the quote unquote n word. i got a black wife and three bi racial children, so i feel i have a right to use that word. i don't give a damn what spike says, tarantino is right. nigger is just a word. if dirty ole bastard can use it every other word so can i.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i would prefer you not use that word in my presence.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{nigger. nigger. nigger. nigger.}
<A>__{delacroix pounces on top of dunwitty like a cat on a mouse and gives him a quick brooklyn beat down.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{say it again. c'mon, say it again.}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{dunwitty. he's a bloody pulp.}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{delacroix. he straightens his tie.}
<C>__{delacroix }
<D>__{who's a nigger now?}
<A>__{pow. this is a fantasy in delacroix's mind. we go back to reality. everything's how we left it.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{the material you've been creating is too white bread. white people with black faces. the huxtable's, cosby, revolutionary. but that's dead. we can't go down that road again.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i don't agree. the negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{i'm telling you it's not.}
<A>__{he goes to his desk, picks up delacroix's scripts and starts throwing them one by one against the window.}
<C>__{dunwitty }
<D>__{the middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave. the middle class black family moves into a small southern town that is run by the kkk. the middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter. the middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter. the middle class single black mother raises her teenage son. and so on and so forth. it's too clean, too antiseptic...}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{...to white? i still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{delacroix, wake up, brother man. the reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody and i mean nobody niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i've never been given a fair shot.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{you got your head stuck up your ass with your harvard education and your pretentious ways. brother man, i'm blacker than you. i'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i'm an oreo, a sell out? because i don't aspire to do homeboys from out of space, secret diary of desmond pfeiffer, a pj's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show? i'm a tom? i'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? is that what you think?}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{that's exactly what i think. i want you to create something that people want to see. let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and i'm including 35 million african americans. you know and i know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles. this is a golden opportunity now. these idiots have to be led to the water.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i'm not sure if i can deliver what you want.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{you will or you'll be back at bet so quick you'll never know what hit you. i need a mid season replacement and pronto. it will be on the fast track.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{what is it you want from me? some plantation follies? some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch? some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads? you want me to go back to the ante bellum days?}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{yes! yes! yes! i want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week. i want advertisers dying to buy on this show. i'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.}
