<A>__{a red bmw convertible speeds through the back lot. behind the wheel is dewey rielly. former police officer, turned technical advisor on the red hot set of . . . stab 3: return to woodsboro. all around the lot are promotional banners and posters for the film. dewey parks his car outside a soundstage, exits.}

<L>__{interior stab 3 set day}
<A>__{a huge replication of woodsboro in a building about the size of an airplane hanger. in one corner we've got the macher and prescott homes. in another corner stands the infamous becker house where the nightmare all began. in other regions are sights like the town square and market, an exterior for the woodsboro police station, a top story news van, etc. dewey, enters set, bumping into his movie alter ego tom prinze, a hollywood poster boy. very cool. not so debonair. a shoddy copy of dewey at best. however, the conversation between the two is friendly, and they exchange greetings.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{hey dew, did you hear?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{no, what?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{somebody iced ben damon and his girlfriend.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{that's hollywood tom. one day you're making movies in the hills, the next day you're posing for the coroner downtown on a slab.}
<A>__{dewey's obviously gotten a lot colder since the last film. he walks past a clique of stab 3's main cast: there's: sarah darling: 30, playing a 25 year old bimbo. very hot. very blonde. ample cleavage. angelina tyler: 20. extremely nadve looking. she won her part in stab 3 playing sidney through a phone in radio contest. she's timid, with short dark hair. out of the entire cast, she is the closet to sidney, they got. and also the loveable tyson jackson: late 20's, african american, all attitude. the three flip through pages of the stab 3 script, conversing freely about the production.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{goddamnit i am getting so fed up with these re writes. it's like every five minutes there's a new script. god, and you just know this all because of stab 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.}

<C>__{tyson}

<C>__{angelina}

<C>__{tom}
<D>__{talk about moody.}
<A>__{tom leans back seductively, his crotch in full view, staring at sarah with bedroom eyes.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{and how about you good looking? got any plans for later?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{eww yeah, finding a guy to have sex with that doesn't look like you.}
