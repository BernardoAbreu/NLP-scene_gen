<L>__{interior mall night}
<A>__{the lights are turned off and the mall is empty. ronnie walks out with dennis.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{dennis, man, i'm glad we've got a minute to talk. there's no easy way to say this so i'm just going to come right out with it. mark offered me the position of head of mall security. i know this isn't easy for you to hear seeing as you've been here longer than me. but i want you to know that you're my best friend and i'm only going to accept the job if you're okay with that.}
<A>__{dennis shrugs.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well, you should know i've already accepted and it's too late to turn it down now. every ship needs a captain. so you were passed over. who gives a shit? dennis, in time, you'll come to accept answering to me. remember, there aren't any leaders in friendship. we cool?}
<A>__{dennis and ronnie shake hands. they walk out and lock the doors behind them.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{hey, you want to go and grab a beer or something?}
<A>__{dennis doesn't say anything and just walks to his car. ronnie follows.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah, you're right. you're probably in no mood to party after that news. well, try not to take it too hard. see you later, buddy.}
<A>__{ronnie leaves dennis and walks to his car.}
