<A>__{various shots of annie connecting herself back to the rest of the world, by plugging in her computer, fax, etc... grace is in the other room, as she was in the motel. alone. with no television, she is just listening to her music laying on the couch. the two women remain separate no matter where they are. but we see a small difference. grace rises and walks to the window. she looks out; pov: she sees people working about the ranch. maybe joe is among them riding his horse as he works. or maybe it's just a vision of people with tasks to complete who do so with pride, discipline and clarity. grace looks out the window longingly.}
