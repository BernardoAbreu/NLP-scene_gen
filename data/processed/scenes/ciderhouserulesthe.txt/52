<L>__{interior operating room morning}
<A>__{edna is holding the head of the frightened young girl. the girl is feverishly hot and whimpering; she keeps looking at her feet in the stirrups as if she's an animal caught in a trap. larch and homer stand on either side of her.}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{her temperature is a hundred and four.}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(very gently)}
<D>__{how old are you, dear? thirteen?}
<A>__{the girl shakes her head. the pain stabs her again.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{twelve? are you twelve, dear?}
<P>__{(the girl nods)}
<D>__{you have to tell me how long you've been pregnant.}
<P>__{(the girl freezes)}
<D>__{three months?}
<A>__{another stab of pain contorts the girl.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{are you four months pregnant?}
<A>__{the girl holds her breath while he examines her abdomen; homer very delicately examines the girl's abdomen, too.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(whispers to larch)}
<D>__{she's at least five.}
<A>__{the girl goes rigid as larch bends into position.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{dear child, it won't hurt when i look. i'm just going to look.}
<A>__{homer assists larch with the speculum.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{tell me: you haven't done something to yourself, have you? twelve year old girl it wasn't me!}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{did you go to someone else? twelve year old girl he said he was a doctor. i would never have stuck that inside me!}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{stuck what inside you?}
<A>__{homer holds the girl still she is babbling on and on while larch is examining her.}
<D>__{twelve year old girl it wasn't me! i would never do no such thing! i wouldn't stick that inside me! it wasn't me!}
<A>__{larch, his wild eye peering into the speculum, makes an audible gasp from the shock of what he sees inside the girl. larch tells homer to have a look. larch then whispers something to edna; she brings the ether bottle and cone quickly. larch starts putting the cone in place, over the nose and mouth of the frightened girl. homer bends to the speculum.}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(to the twelve year old)}
<D>__{listen, you've been very brave. i'm going to put you to sleep you won't feel it anymore. you've been brave enough.}
<A>__{homer stares into the speculum; he closes his eyes. the girl is resisting the ether, but her eyelids flutter closed.}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{that's a heavy sedation.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{you bet it's a heavy sedation! the fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. i think it's a crochet hook.}
<A>__{homer has pulled off his surgical mask. he leans over the scrub sink, splashing cold water on his face.}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(to homer)}
<D>__{if she'd come to you four months ago and asked you for a simple d and c, what would you have decided to do? nothing? this is what doing nothing gets you, homer. it means that someone else is going to do the job some moron who doesn't know how!}
<A>__{homer, furious, leaves the operating room. edna lifts the girl's eyelids for larch so that he can see how well under the ether she is.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{i wish you'd come to me, dear child. you should have come to me, instead.}
