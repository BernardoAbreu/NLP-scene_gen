<D>__{who's jack frost?}
<A>__{jack reaches down and grabs a hand full of snow from off the ground. with his palm open, jack uses his magic to form the perfect snowball. he then puckers his lips, and blows onto it with his icy breath. the snowball turns a light shade of blue. there's something going on here.}
