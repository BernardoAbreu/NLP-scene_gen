<L>__{exterior cathy's house night}
<A>__{matt, holding the script, walks the small lane through the tidy lawn to the perfect silver lake cottage. we hear music from inside. (a soundtrack.) there is a note on the door, which is slightly ajar, reading: "come right in if you loved it ring if you have reservations." matt enters.}
<L>__{interior cathy's house night}
<A>__{white walls, thick rugs, great, great, fantasy garret; sparse, but cozy. he walks a step, then there is a girlish squeal and a naked cathy streaks the rest of the way to her bedroom from the bathroom.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{i mistimed it.}
<P>__{(sticking her head out the door)}
<D>__{i wanted you to catch me fully frontal.}
<A>__{she smiles broadly; hurriedly putting on something quick and loose to match her buzz. as she walks to him, the phone rings. she ignores it.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{so you loved it. a lot? a little?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{give me a second all of a sudden, there's a lot to deal with.}
<A>__{she sits on the sofa looking at him.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{it's terrific.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{do you see why i think you're right?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{because you're nice and you know i need work.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(lower)}
<D>__{you know this is really happening, so i wish you wouldn't kid around about it.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{sorry, but i think the audition rule is that i have to be serious unless the person in charge is wearing a bathrobe and her nipples are sticking out...}
<P>__{(holds fingers apart)}
<D>__{...this much.}
<A>__{cathy peeks down her bathrobe. then broadly.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{there are some mixed signals coming out of here, aren't there?}
<P>__{(phone rings; she answers)}
<D>__{hi. working... i can't write down a number now. call me back.}
<P>__{(to matt)}
<D>__{the script?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it's really good. i get a little nervous thinking about the opportunity.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i want to hear everything. you want to go page by page?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{if it's okay. i kind of work on these things in a private... it's just... it's a little better for me if i don't...}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{okay, let's do it. it won't kill me.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{please. i understand.}
<A>__{an uncertain beat and then she leans over and kisses him. a sound escapes him. they get up and begin walking to the bedroom.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i swear to god, i don't know which thing i want more, the sex or the conversation afterwards.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(a smile)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
