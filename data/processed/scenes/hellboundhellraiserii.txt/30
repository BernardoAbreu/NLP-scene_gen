<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{as he closes the door to kirsty's room, kyle reaches into the pocket of his lab coat and produces a small box of pills.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{anyway, let's concentrate on you for a moment. wanna suck on this for me?}
<A>__{kirsty looks up at him sharply. he is proffering a pill and grinning facetiously.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{hey, good joke, kyle. do you always come on to the mentally ill?}
<A>__{kyle's face falls. he blushes. pressing the pills into kirsty's hand, he backs off to the door, apologising.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{shit. sorry. here's the pills. red face. door. bye.}
<A>__{he exits hurriedly, closing the door behind him. kirsty grins despite herself. she looks at the pill for a second or two and then puts it firmly back in the box. realising there is no bedside table, she puts the box on the wooden chair.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{jesus, i'm glad i'm not paying for this place.}
<A>__{she is about to lie down on the bed, when she senses something is wrong in the room. kirsty is instantly tense again. she swings her head to the side and tenses in horror, stifling a scream. in the corner of the room, against the wall lying in a pool of blood, is her skinned father larry. kirsty emits a pained moan of pure anguish as she realises what she is looking at.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{daddy...}
<A>__{the thing in the corner raises its arm weakly from its side and begins to write on the wall in its own blood. it writes : i am in hell; help me. kirsty covers her eyes with her hands and begins to sob. kirsty takes her hands from her eyes. the figure has gone. the pool of blood has disappeared. but, on the wall the words remain. kirsty makes herself rise from the bed and walk slowly across the room. her eyes full of tears, she stretches out her arm and touches the word 'i'. as her fingers make contact, the words instantly disappear. she presses her bloodied finger quickly to her lips before that last trace of her father can vanish, too.}
