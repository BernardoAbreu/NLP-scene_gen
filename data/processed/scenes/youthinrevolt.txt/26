<A>__{a dusty road. nick totes a watermelon and a paper bag. he watches as sheeni works on a popsicle. full lips that cry out to be kissed.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you don't have to go to services?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{no. much to the consternation of my fanatical parents i have converted to atheism. fortunately my brother, paul, paved the way for such transgressions.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{paul is an atheist too?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{buddhist, i believe, though we have not seen him in some time. i myself am looking forward to being free of parental bondage.}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you could say the same thing about sex.}
<A>__{sheeni stops. she looks at nick intently.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{nick, are you going to turn out like all the other young men and have nothing on your mind except carnal pleasures?}

<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{really? i think about it all the time. it's the hormones at work, you know.}
