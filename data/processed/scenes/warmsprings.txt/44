<L>__{exterior the meriwether inn day}
<A>__{tom's car turns into a driveway. franklin has a brochure for "the meriwether inn" opened in his lap. he tries to spy the building through the trees but cannot. he looks back at the brochure. the picture is of a lavish victorian hotel and the words, "our renowned mineral hot springs can cure whatever ails you!" franklin looks up and sees a three story hideous green and yellow monstrosity leaning slightly to one side. paint is peeling everywhere. what once were flower beds are overgrown with weeds. the car pulls to a stop.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you'll have a great deal of privacy. there are only a few guests right now as it's the off season... i'm hoping to make some improvements by next spring }
<A>__{franklin puts out his arm preventing tom from getting out of the car.}
<C>__{franklin}
<P>__{(panicked)}
<D>__{i... i can't stay here. this place is a wreck.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{franklin!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{look on the bright side. most of your time will be spent in the water.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{it's true, we've fallen on some hard times...}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{hard times? this is a disaster! it should be condemned!}
<A>__{tom's southern manners are being put to the test, but he stays remarkably calm.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yes, we've seen better days.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{but then i imagine so have you.}
<A>__{franklin blinks incomprehensibly at tom and what he has just said.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i'm happy to drive you back to the train station right now, if that's what you want.}
<A>__{they lock eyes. franklin wonders if tom's bluffing, but he can't tell.}
<C>__{franklin}
<P>__{(in a low voice)}
<D>__{fire. i'm frightened of fire. i can't get out if i'm upstairs.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{we've got options.}
