<A>__{ray steps away from the door, looking around the vast plains as the sun comes up out of the black hills. he is roadblocked, and it shows in his eyes. it's all getting too big. crow horse leans against the shack, watching ray. and then radio static from inside the le baron. ray pivots and stares at it as if someone is inside the car. his call signal is being paged. but he just stands there, looking at it.}

<D>__{x21. read. x21...}
<A>__{ray reaches inside the car and lifts the handset. he takes a breath before pressing it to his lips.}

<D>__{ray. what's your 20?}

<D>__{reservation.}

<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you go to the council fire. i'm going back in.}

<D>__{ray.}
<A>__{ray swings in behind the wheel, starts the car, and barrels off recklessly down the rutted road, leaving crow horse behind.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{ray!}
<A>__{the le baron is already out to where sight reaches farther than sound and silent white dust mushrooms skyward.}
