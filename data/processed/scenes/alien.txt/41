<L>__{interior control room of alien ship}
<A>__{this chamber is totally dark as broussard arrives at the top of the hole. standard stands with his flashlight camera ("datastick") tracing a beam through the hanging dust. broussard unclips himself from the climbing wire, then raises his own light. at that moment, melkonis arrives at the top of the hole. their lights scan the room. the beams are clearly visible as columns of light in the floating dust. they reveal heavy, odd shapes. broussard stumbles over something. he shines his light down on it. it is a large, glossy urn, brown in color, with peculiar markings. broussard stands it upright. it has a round opening in the top, and is empty. suddenly, melkonis lets out a grunt of shock. their lights have illuminated something unspeakably grotesque: a huge alien skeleton,}
<B>__{seated in the control chair.}
<A>__{they approach the skeleton, their lights trained on it. it is a grotesque thing, bearing no resemblance to the human form.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{holy christ...}
<A>__{standard shines his light on the console at which the hideous skeleton is seated. he moves his light closer and peers at the panel.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{look at this...}
<A>__{they approach.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{something has been scratched here... into the veneer. see?}
<A>__{traced raggedly onto the surface of the panel, as by the point of a sharp instrument, is a small triangle: hearing something, broussard flashes his light across the room. as the beam scans the walls, it briefly touches on something that moves. melkonis convulsively yanks out his pistol.}
<D>__{melkonis look out, it moved !}
<A>__{standard knocks his hand down.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{keep away from that gun!}
<A>__{standard shoulders himself in front of the others. then, slowly, he begins to move toward the far side of the room. they approach a console on the wall, training their lights on it. there is a machine. on the machine, a small bar moves steadily back and forth, sliding noiselessly in its grooves.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{just machinery.}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{but functioning.}
<A>__{melkonis looks down at his direction finder.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{that's where the transmission is coming from.}
<A>__{he throws a switch on the direction finder with a crackle and a hum, the unearthly voice fills their earphones.}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{a recording. a damned automatic recording.}
