<D>__{i'm successful, right? i mean, i could say to a woman, i'm a screenwriter and she'd look at me differently. i could get laid. but i want someone to like me. for me. y'know? the way i like them. the way i'd do anything for that woman walking down the street. a million women walking down the street. i don't need to know what their jobs are. no one will ever love me like that. like i love almost every woman i see.}
