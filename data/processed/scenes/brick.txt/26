<L>__{exterior back patio night}
<A>__{brendan joins laura, hands her a drink. suburban lights fill the valley below. laura sips her drink.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i will never get through all this.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{she sips more.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i knew your old partner jerr since grade school. tough break. how long were you two joined up before your operation got the sting?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{a few months. could have helped himself out by turning me in, but he took the heat. he was a good guy. solid.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{was he?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you knew him.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{yeah i did. so why are you here tonight?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i'm looking for emily.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{she wasn't invited.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{she had an invitation.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{well like you said, i've got to work on that. em's been awol for a good month, nobody's seen her.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i saw her yesterday.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{nearly nobody's seen her. so what did she tell you?}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(winces)}
<D>__{score 0 for finesse.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{listen, you're scratching at the wrong door. i wasn't with emily enough to know details of what she was in, i just got wind of the downfall, and i didn't get any details of that, except that it was bad. so now that we're showing some cards...}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{if you haven't got a finger in em's troubles, why'd her name get me into your rather exclusive party?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{keep up with me now. i don't know, but it sounded like you did, and a body's got a right to be curious. now i'm not so sure.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{well i will put that body to bed. i don't know a damn thing about whatever troubles, and that works for me. i just want to find her.}
<A>__{a long beat. laura studies brendan's face, then seems to come to a decision.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{coffee and pie.}
<A>__{the words hang in the air a moment. a look of recognition from brendan.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{coffee and pie oh my?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{and you didn't hear it from me.}
<A>__{he sips his drink. a voice calls from the glass door. another girl. laura flashes brendan a look and goes to her. they have quick, quiet words and the girl leaves. laura turns back to brendan.}
<D>__{laura (cont'd) (cont'd) will you wait here for me?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you'll stay right here and wait i will be five minutes.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the moment she leaves brendan runs across the lawn and hops the fence, into the neighbor's yard.}
