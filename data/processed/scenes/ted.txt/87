<L>__{exterior grocery store later that night}
<A>__{we see the "closed" sign on the door. ted exits, finishing off a bottle of beer. he walks around to the dumpster alley, and lines up for a kareem style sky hook shot into a trash can. he takes the shot:}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{kareem!}
<A>__{the bottle smashes off the side of the can, and shatters.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{you suck, kareem.}
<A>__{we hear a soft footstep somewhere o.s. ted turns and looks around. there appears to be no one in the darkness.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{no answer. he looks around for a beat, and finds nothing. he turns... and finds himself facing donny, who stands eerily lit by a single outdoor wall bulb.}
<C>__{donny}
<D>__{hello, ted.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{gah! uh... hi there.}
<C>__{donny}
<D>__{are you all alone out here?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{uh... no. no i'm not. i'm... you know, you're never alone when you're with christ.}
<C>__{donny}
<D>__{you know, robert and i could give you a very, very good home.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'm... i'm pretty happy where i am. i just got a shitty new apartment }
<C>__{donny}
<D>__{i can offer you six thousand dollars in railroad bonds. they were left to me by my father.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well, gosh, you know, since i just returned from active duty in the civil war, that sounds really appealing. oh wait, no, that was a hundred and fifty years ago, and i don't give a shit.}
<A>__{tami lynn approaches.}
<D>__{tami lynn teddy, come on we're gonna have pop tarts and cigarettes with my mom before she goes to work.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah, i'm comin', sweetheart.}
<P>__{(to donny)}
<D>__{yeah, my dance card is quite full, so i'm gonna have to decline.}
<C>__{donny}
<D>__{i really wish you wouldn't...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah, sorry. but, ah... you know, i'd like to thank you for creepin' up my night, and... jesus be with you. in christ.}
<A>__{ted hurries off. angle on donny, who looks eerily determined.}
