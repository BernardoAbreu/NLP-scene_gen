<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{i didn't.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what, you're the victim? the big creator can't stand up to one little d girl? it was your choice. i didn't make you do anything. i mean, do you have any principles? do you believe in anything but your own ego?}

<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{your dialogue used to be sharper. maybe gatins could do a polish.}
<A>__{he suddenly punches her, one hit to the face. she drops hard. gavin takes a step back. tasting blood, susan gets to her knees. a wry smile.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{is that all there is?}
<A>__{in the background, we see partygoers responding to the blow. susan gets to her feet. she approaches gavin, hands open. she's not going to hit him.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{do you feel like a man? because i will tell you a secret.}
<A>__{she leans in very close to his ear. there's a strange intimacy between them.}
<C>__{susan }
