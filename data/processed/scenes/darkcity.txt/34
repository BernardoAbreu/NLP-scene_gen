<A>__{two silhouetted figures face each other across a polished black table. they speak in a foreign language. a phone rings. figure 1 picks up the receiver and listens attentively. figure 2 is involved with various metal shapes he is trying to lock together. a complex puzzle. he gets impatient with the puzzle, dashes it to the floor. figure 1, on the phone, hangs up and writes something. hands the note to figure 2, who in turn drops it into a chute.}
<B>__{control room}
<A>__{the note falls from a slot in the wall before figure 3 (in shadow yet again). he reads from the note over a silver microphone, still in the unfamiliar tongue. tight on a speaker his distorted voice. a final mysterious person figure 4 listens to the announcement. he takes a stick and moves a small cut out figure of a man across a board, away from a large grouping of similar cut outs. the board resembles a planning table in a war room. a high angle as the camera pull backs on the grouping of cut out figures. more and more of them. ten. twenty. a hundred. a sinister army.}
