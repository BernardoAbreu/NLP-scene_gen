<A>__{jack stands alone, tuning his fiddle. no matter how much he turns the peg the top string always sounds flat. he tunes some more and breaks it.}
<C>__{jack}

<D>__{...and bloody death!}
<A>__{every word is plainly audible to the men on watch, who pretend to hear nothing.}

<A>__{jack is fitting a new string. widen to reveal stephen sitting opposite with his cello.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i was merely remarking that you have always prided yourself on not being a flogging captain and this...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i am not a "flogging captain". i have not once rigged the grating on this voyage, not once in twelve thousand miles. besides, i wager you will find a deal more brutality on land.}
<A>__{tightening the new string. the note escalating as he turns.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i'm not a party to it on land.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well you are party to it on my ship. men must be governed. often not wisely i grant you, but there are hierarchies even in nature, as you've often said yourself.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{hierarchies. that is the excuse of every tyrant in history. of nero. of boneparte.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(trying to call a halt)}
<D>__{yes. fine words i'm sure}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(continues regardless)}
<D>__{...we are not animals and i for one am opposed to authority, that egg of misery and oppression..}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{very fine words stephen, but in these current circumstances, hard work and firm discipline is what keeps our little wooden world together.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{and grog i suppose.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{of course. what of it? of course they have their grog! stephen (sits) (cont'd) you know nagel was drunk when he insulted hollom. and higgins is never sober. even the midshipmen...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the men will have their grog stephen. it is part of the immemorial tradition of the service}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{well a shameful tradition it is too. to have them pressed from their homes, kept in a permanent state of dull inebriation.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{stephen...}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{...confined for months in a wooden prison, never more than a few hours sleep and flogged when drunken idleness drives them to....}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{...stephen! i warn you that friend or no i will not have you talk of the service like that.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i am stating plain facts}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(finally explodes)}
<D>__{well i will not hear them! from you or anyone. you understand! things are as they are for good or bad whether or not they have a place in your damned papist philosophy. if you are here to make music then sit down and play. if not be gone, for you have come to the wrong shop for anarchy!}
<A>__{in stony silence stephen puts down his cello bow and leaves past killick, who is lurking as always by the door.}
