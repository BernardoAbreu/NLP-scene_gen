<A>__{fade into soft focus. slowing taking form... a cat's face seen in extreme close up. wider to reveal the cat resting on bernie's chest. she meows as he stirs awake. he's stunned to see her there.}

<D>__{trixie?}
<A>__{the cat jumps off his chest and slinks over to her empty food bowl. meows again. bernie breaks into a wide smile.}
<C>__{bernie}
