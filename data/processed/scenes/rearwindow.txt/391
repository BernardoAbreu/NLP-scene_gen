<L>__{exterior neighborhood night semi long shot}
<A>__{thorwald crosses the living room, and goes into the bedroom. suddenly he looks onto the bed. he picks up the open alligator handbag. he turns, facing the window, looking down at the bag. he looks up in the direction of the living room. then suddenly his whole frame stiffens, his head turns a little further around to his right. he is looking directly at lisa who is out of our sight in the corner of the bedroom. he holds out the bag, and without moving, starts to question the unseen lisa. he takes a little step forward, and his head begins to turn slightly to the left as lisa begins to emerge into the living room, backing away slowly. by her gestures, and nervous laughter, she appears to be offering a lame excuse for being found in his apartment. he comes towards her, and enters the living room as well. lisa edging toward the door, points to it as she apparently argues with him as to the way she came in. he points to the window. she makes one more step toward the door, but thorwald reaches out quickly and grabs her by the wrist. he twists it brutally, and flings her sideways into the sofa beneath the window. her head snaps back against the head rest. with his right hand he throws the handbag across the room in anger, and with his left open palmed he demands something from lisa. slowly her right hand comes up and opens. he takes the jewelry from her, looks at it for a surprised moment, puts it into his coat pocket. he reaches down with both hands, and by the wrists jerks her to her feet. he is talking viciously to her. we can hear lisa calling out faintly: "jeff! jeff!" thorwald suddenly looks out at the neighborhood. he realizes that somebody might be watching him. he drags her across the room, reaches up with one arm, and the lights go off. the faint light from the bedroom illuminates their struggle, but not clearly.}
