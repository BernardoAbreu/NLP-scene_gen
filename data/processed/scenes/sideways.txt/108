<L>__{interior motel room night}
<A>__{pop! miles opens a bottle of pinot and pours himself a glass. he carries it to bed, takes a nice big slug, lies down on the bed and opens his magazine. now sneezing atop the bed angle on top of him the barely legal face down on his chest, miles awakens with a start and looks at the clock radio. he thinks a moment, takes a deep breath, and bounds off the bed. close on a water saver shower head as little needles of water come at us. through the bathroom door miles takes a nice hot shower. but wait he has forgotten to put the shower curtain inside the tub. a closer look reveals a growing puddle of water on the floor.}
