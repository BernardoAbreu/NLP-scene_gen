<L>__{int the stage continuous}
<A>__{the angry troupe huddles amongst the clutter of props and jumbled scenery. tony is on trial. dr. parnassus is sitting in a corner, head in hands. he seems utterly destroyed.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{you're a l liar. you've been lying to us all along. who are you? who were those thugs?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i am not a liar!}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{no! i just... didn't divulge everything i knew.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{comes to the same thing.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{absolutely not. not in law.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{you stole their money.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{no. i didn't.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{that's what they said.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{are you going to believe them before you believe me?}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{because they're irredeemably bad people, and i'm essentially good. i know that sounds terribly prim and arrogant and self righteous, but i'm trying to be honest. look, the truth is... in order to get my charity off the ground i needed capital.}
<A>__{anton looks askance.}
<C>__{tony }
<P>__{(in response to anton)}
<D>__{yes, i know, and you're right, but that's the way the grown up..the real world works. you can't make omelettes without soiling your hands. or should that be the other way round? anyway, i with hindsight very foolishly accepted a loan from people who seemed to me, at the time, to be very decent and sincere. there was absolutely no way i could have known that they were part of a ruthless organised crime syndicate and that they wanted to use my charity to launder money. i made a mistake. and i have to live with that. i'm sorry. what more can i say?}
<A>__{valentina wants to believe tony. anton and percy don't.}
<C>__{valentina}
<P>__{(distressed but basically sympathetic)}
<D>__{oh tony.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{but, can we not talk about me for a moment.. i want to thank the doctor for letting me experience the most sublime, inspiring ....}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{so why were they trying to k kill you? "again!" is what they said.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(answering his own question)}
<D>__{the first time they hung you from the b bridge... right?... b because you stole their money.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{stop saying that! i didn't steal it! i didn't have it. i'd had to invest in infrastructure. i needed more time. when you run a charity you have to give lots of money away. you wouldn't believe the red tape. the charity commission are a bunch of fascists. it's incredible. i mean... c'mon give me a break...i almost died today.. and i said i'm sorry... and anyway..... this was supposed to be a special day...it's valentina's birthday.}
<A>__{he pulls out the louis vuitton woman's beautiful necklace from his pocket.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{happy birthday. for a beautiful woman.}
<A>__{he puts it around valentina's neck. valentina smiles. anton glowers.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{the marks on your face...}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{marks?}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{they scrawled something on your forehead. symbols... signs...}
<A>__{tony looks uncomfortable, tries to rub his forehead clean.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{you had some of those when we rescued you.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{yes, what's that about?}
<A>__{but, before he can say anything, there's a knock on the door which startles everyone. they exchange looks. dr. parnassus is frightened but hides this from the others. the knock is repeated. percy starts to get up.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{no! leave it!}
<A>__{percy sits down. the knock comes again.}
<C>__{valentina}
<P>__{(sotto voce to the dr. parnassus)}
<D>__{who is it?}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{it's too late... for visitors.}
<A>__{once more someone knocks. everyone is edgy. particularly}
<B>__{percy.}
<A>__{the knock comes again.}
<C>__{percy}
<P>__{(sotto voce, agitated)}
<D>__{please can we answer the door? i can't stand not answering the door, or the telephone, or whatever. it's not in my nature. i won't sleep for weeks if we don't answer the door! sorry!}
<A>__{dr. parnassus gets up, goes to the door, opens it and steps outside, closing the door behind him. valentina, anton, percy and tony exchange looks.}
<C>__{percy }
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{sorry, i just... i've got a thing about...}
