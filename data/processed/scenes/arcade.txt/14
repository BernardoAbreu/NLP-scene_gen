<L>__{interior dante's inferno day}
<A>__{inside, the inferno is a mishmash of video games, ancient carnival props and old horror movie posters. dusty, creepy under the right circumstances and filled with leering faces... in short, any kid's bedroom taken to a horrific extreme. at dante's inferno, they've got the latest games side by side with chestnuts like pac man.}
<B>__{the group}
<A>__{makes their way inside, joining a cluster of kids in the center of the inferno. and there it is...}
<B>__{arcade}
<A>__{it looks out of place in the midst of the inferno. shiny black, high tech, and almost self contained, like some sort of space age vertical coffin. laser etched graphics on the sides bear the arcade logo and the same strange, frightening face. alex and her friends are suitably impressed, most notably, nick and benz.}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{check it out...}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{definitely cool.}
<A>__{nick is silent, letting his eyes explore the machine. he turns to greg and grins.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{super computers, micro processors... that's the future we're looking at.}
<A>__{another kid, deloach, pushes his way to the front of the group. his fighting a losing battle against acne.}
<C>__{deloach}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{so how come they're previewing it in this shit hole?}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{if you weren't such a dick, you'd know what a cool place this was.}
<C>__{deloach}
<D>__{gimme a break, they got fucking space invaders here. that's shit's for retards.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{so...are you trying to say i'm retarded? is that what you're implying?}
<C>__{deloach}
<D>__{no, but since i'm standing here, i'm noticing that you're an ugly little fuck and you're making me sick...}
<A>__{that's it for stilts. he launches himself at deloach, catching him off guard and knocking him to the floor. nick, alex, and greg are on them in a minute, trying to extract the two from each other.}
<B>__{a large man}
<A>__{pushes his way towards them and effortlessly scoops both boys up, wrapping a beefy hand around the scruffs of their necks. this is finster, the proprietor...enormous, bald, and always irritable.}
<C>__{finster}
<P>__{(shaking them)}
<D>__{cut it out!!!}
<A>__{his face contorts and he spits as he speaks. nice guy. alex steps forward, always the voice of reason.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's okay, mr. finster...}
<C>__{finster}
<D>__{no it's not.}
<P>__{(to the boys)}
<D>__{you guys are shits and i'm throwing you out.}
<C>__{deloach}
<P>__{(acting tough)}
<D>__{your place sucks. who gives a shit about "arcade" anyway?}
<C>__{voice }
<P>__{(booming, metallic)}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<A>__{everyone turns. the voice came from...}
<B>__{arcade}
<A>__{it's up and running now. the inside panel emits an eerie green light. from speakers inside the compartment we can here breathing...the same breathing we heard earlier. coming from a machine like this, it's creepy as hell. even finster is impressed. he releases the boys and stares at the machine.}
<C>__{laurie}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{jesus...}
<C>__{another voice }
<D>__{not bad, huh?}
<A>__{a man steps out from behind the arcade machine. he grins happily, dressed to kill, sporting a slip stream id tag. this is difford, p.r. man for slip stream.}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{hi, kids.}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{mr. finster...}
<A>__{the arcade machine continues to breathe, inhale, exhale... the eyes in the face are glowing now, in unison with the breathing. difford draws closer and indicates the machine behind him with a nod.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(smooth as silk)}
<D>__{we're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product. we think it's going to be a big seller. but you're the people that make it happen. you're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at. it's your opinion that's going to make or break us.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{so what's so different about arcade? you guys've been talking about it for months.}
<A>__{difford turns to nick and salutes him.}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{a man after my own heart. straight to the pointerior}
<P>__{(to everyone)}
<D>__{what's different about arcade is the way it reacts. it responds like a human does. it learns. it adapts. each time you play, it changes its strategy.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{that's impossible.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(taking the bait)}
<D>__{is it? why don't you see for your self?}
<A>__{difford reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a quarter. he tosses it at...}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{who snags it out of mid air and grins.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{go for it, nick.}
<A>__{difford steps aside and waves nick to the machine. the rest of the kids crowd around.}
<B>__{arcade}
<A>__{isn't just your typical video game. first of all there are three screens...front, left, and right...which provide a panoramic view while playing. second, the player wears "data gloves" (which provide an actual sensation of touch) and stereoscopic goggles which in turn are wired directly into the machine. the results give the user the feeling that he she has actually entered the video game universe. difford thinks he has a hit on his hands, and his excitement shows.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(indicating equipment)}
<D>__{the cybergloves are keyed into the game's response mechanism. you'll be able to pick things up inside the world...tools, weapons ... it'll feel like they're really in your hands...}
<A>__{nick pulls on the gloves, securing them with velcro straps.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the goggles heighten the experience. when we said "reality will never be the same", we weren't kidding.}
<A>__{difford places the goggles on nick's face. then he points to the control board, which features two joy sticks and a large red button labeled "escape".}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{"escape"?}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{in case things get too intense. it automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather. things can get pretty wild...}
<C>__{benz}
<P>__{(scoffing)}
<D>__{nick won't need it.}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{you're good, eh?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{the best.}
<A>__{nick winks at alex and greg.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(to difford)}
<D>__{so what's the scenario? am i saving a princess? fighting zombies?}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{it changes. there are eleven levels. each one is a different layer of the arcade universe. the concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... arcade's brain.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{so how do i start?}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{the game will guide you.}
<A>__{nick turns back to the machine and pops the quarter into the coin slot. he punches the "start" button on the top of one of the joy sticks. immediately the screens come to life. darkness with shooting stars of light racing back and forth.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{a three dimensional computer generated face appears out of the darkness, spinning in from far away and coming to rest.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{i am arcade.}
<P>__{(breathing)}
<D>__{you want to play games? you picked the wrong machine.}
<A>__{the crowd of kids is suitably impressed. even alex is amused. so far, so good.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{nick.}
<C>__{arcade}
<P>__{(almost contemptuous)}
<D>__{nick. kiss reality goodbye.}
<A>__{suddenly, a lightbeam above the video screen illuminates nick's face.}
<C>__{laurie}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{what's it doing?!}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{memorizing nick's features. watch.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{the face of arcade spins away and a computer generated figure appears, complete with a pixel rendered version of nick's face!}
<B>__{video nick}
<A>__{is dressed in futuristic armor with exaggerated cybergloves and a full helmet on instead of goggles. he also wears elbow and knee pads and carries a thrasher in his hands, sort of a cross between a souped up skateboard and the silver surfer's board. it's his means of transportation. the screen prints out: "nick. enter the vortex".}
<B>__{video nick}
<A>__{hops onto the thrasher. abruptly the world around him begins to spin, and video nick is shooting a curl, a whirlpool of light...down, down, faster and faster, until... boom! empty space and video nick is falling towards a circuit grid. it's the electronic universe rushing up to meet him...}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{one word of advice, nick. you spend too much time in one place, and i send out the screamer. you don't want to be around when that happens.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{see you on the other side.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{video nick plummets from the sky like a meteor, slamming into the ground with an explosion of dust. the dust clears. video nick is standing on an eerie plain, with strange reed like plants dotting the ground and mist coiling around everything. it looks like earth, and yet...it doesn't.}
<B>__{video nick}
<A>__{hops onto the thrasher and begins to move. and move it does. with a whoop! the arcade world is rushing past us. the game has begun. on nick's face as a smile gradually creeps across it. he's having the time of his life, gloved hands manipulating the joy sticks like mad. from his reactions, we can tell that this is one of the most incredible things he's ever experienced.}
<B>__{the other kids}
<A>__{watch nick, then the screen, then nick again...}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{check it out!}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{come on, nick...}
<A>__{now everyone is laughing, urging nick on. it's like they've all discovered the most amazing toy...something that's going to turn their world upset down.}
<B>__{difford}
<A>__{is pleased as punch, watching the kids' reactions more than the game.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{images are rushing past at blinding speed, lasers, explosions, and god knows what...}
<B>__{on nick}
<A>__{as sweat begins to trickle down his fast. his hands move faster and faster, in response to the game. the screen. nick. the screen and... bam!!! nick slams down the escape button and rips off his goggles. the video image freezes.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{he's practically hyperventilating, sweat pouring down his face. he leans over, resting a hand on the control board. and for a moment, everyone is silent. then...}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{nick...you okay?}
<A>__{slowly, nick lifts his head. he's now sporting a devilish grin.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you gotta try this thing.}
<A>__{nick pulls off his cybergloves and holds them out for greg. greg turns to alex.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{go for it.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{hold my keys, then.}
<A>__{he hands her his keychain and takes the cybergloves from nick. greg pulls them on, then straps on the goggles.}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(to difford)}
<D>__{so how do i get back in?}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{just hit "escape" again.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{greg hits the button and immediately the image unfreezes. once again, we're on the thrasher board, rushing across the plains. greg's face as a smile slowly creeps across it.}
