<L>__{interior lobby night}
<A>__{again there is a cordoned area in the center where seattle luminaries are sipping champagne. reporter #1 lurches forward:}
<D>__{reporter #1 can you make some statement about seattle, how the city helped you, or the schools }
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{well, the truth is the city had nothing to do with it. i was lucky. and what wasn't luck was hard work. reporter #1}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{judge hillier's wife, whom we recognize as the woman who shouted at frances in the auditorium, steps forward in a garish gown. she's holding a large key.}
<C>__{judge hillier's wife}
<D>__{miss farmer, i can't tell you how proud i am to meet you.}
<A>__{she embraces and kisses frances, who's more than a little put off. after the kiss, she takes firm hold of frances' hand and won't let go. judge hillier steps to his wife's side. lillian also approaches.}
<C>__{judge hillier's wife}
<D>__{on behalf of the seattle ladies club, as a token of our vast admiration }
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<C>__{judge hillier's wife}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{yes...?}
<C>__{frances}

<C>__{judge hillier's wife}
<D>__{i don't believe so.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{sure. you shouted at me in the auditorium when i read my essay.}
<C>__{judge hillier's wife}
<D>__{no, my dear. you must be mistaken.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(barely audible)}

<C>__{judge hillier}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(to the dignitaries)}
<D>__{listen, i'm still the same girl that wrote that essay, the same girl who went to russia, and you people aren't proud to meet me at all.}
<A>__{a hideous silence. judge hillier is fuming. his wife is aghast, the key to the city extended awkwardly in front of her. she shoves it into frances' arms. frances moves to leave, but her arm is taken by the studio executive, who escorts her into the theatre. the crowd follows. lillian is utterly mortified.}
