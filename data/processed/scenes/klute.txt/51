<C>__{bree}
<D>__{hi? _}
<A>__{angle past mr. faber, to bree mr. faber is silhouetted for a moment, standing, watching her, from along an alleyway of garments. she sees him, is startled then relieved.}

<D>__{oh }
<A>__{he moves toward her. reverse angle, to mr. faber mr. faber is a man of 65 or so, rather handsome, and for this occasion very spruce, very erect, very nattily turned out. bree complains cheerfully.}
<C>__{bree }
<D>__{you scared me, mr. faber.}
<A>__{he smiles, kisses her cheek, tests the fabric of her evening dress (in passing, as a matter of expertise).}
<C>__{mr. faber}
<D>__{good material, not too good cut. i'd do better for you.}
<A>__{then he turns, lifts down a woman's dress cape, carrying it graciously gestures her to precede him }
<B>__{corner of cutting room}
<A>__{a dim pool of light here. a private area here, sectioned off by rows of garments. a couch, rug, coffee table, a chair or two a place for buyers to take their ease. bree and mr. faber enter. her manner is suddenly elegant, assured, regal; his befits a man of the world. he fits the cloak around her shoulders and gestures to the couch; she sits. he pours a glass of wine for her, for himself. she speaks with a neat continental accent doing it fairly well, really a member of the international set.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{oh thank you.}
<A>__{he sits in the chair opposite, sips his wine.}
<C>__{mr. faber}

<C>__{bree }
<D>__{ may i? it's so }
<C>__{mr. faber}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{please }
<A>__{she stands, unloosing the cloak, letting it fall on the couch. but she doesn't sit again begins to move here and there about the enclosure, her hands wandering about her dress and body an erotic restlessness.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{not young; he wasn't young gray at the temples, he well actually he looked like you.}
