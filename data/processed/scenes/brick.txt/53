<L>__{interior library}
<A>__{warmly lit, sheltering the few souls scattered here and there at tables. the brain sits at one of them reading an impossibly large book. he watches curiously as brendan approaches him.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{hey, brendan.}
<A>__{brendan falls into a chair. the brain looks him over.}
<C>__{the brain }
<D>__{you're up early.}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(thick, distant)}
<D>__{i couldn't sleep.}
<C>__{the brain}
<P>__{(nods, back to his book)}
<D>__{find emily?}
<A>__{brendan breathes out softly.}
<C>__{the brain }
<D>__{you alright?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah. what, are you here for zero?}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{nah, i gotta take the early bus, cause the others don't run by my street.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{bad break.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{eh. time to read's nice. so what's the word with em?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{she's gone.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{can't raise her?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{no, i can't.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{so what now?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{now. i don't know. i guess it's... i don't know.}
<A>__{brendan takes a long moment. he stares down at his glasses, wet with condensation.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{brain, i can't let her go. i was set to but i can't. i don't think i can.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{you think you can help her?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{you think you can get the straight, maybe break some deserving teeth?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah. i think i could.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{well.}
<A>__{brendan rubs his forehead.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{kara tried to rope me. she came right out and asked. she was scared. tell me to walk from this, brain. tell me to drop it.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{walk from it. drop it.}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{you're thick as what all, brendan.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yes i am.}
<A>__{brendan cleans his glasses. he looks brain in the eye, and his mannerisms come back into focus.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{i'd need you to op. like on jerr, but that was cake to this. and unlike jerr, there's not much chance we'll come out clean. twenty four seven on this one. you okay to op for me again?}
<A>__{the brain barely smiles.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{what first, tip the bulls?}
<A>__{brendan puts on his glasses, stands to go.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{no, bulls would gum it. they'd flash their dusty standards at the wide eyes and probably find some yegg to pin, probably even the right one. but they'd trample the real tracks and scare the real players back into their holes, and if we're doing this i want the whole story. no cops, not for a bit.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{so what first?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i don't know. your mom still have the cell?}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{in her car.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{borrow it for a few days, get me the number.}
<P>__{(stands to go)}
<D>__{wait for my word, and cover for me first period. i'm going to be a little late.}
