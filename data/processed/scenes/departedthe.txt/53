<L>__{interior a horrible bar in southie. night}
<A>__{a slow night. billy is at the bar bent over a glass of cranberry juice. the women available are two crones. [dialog on separate document]. stark contrast to colin's evening. a bookmaker on the phone. billy, by the glances of people looking at him, has made his bones. he's treated with respect. his hand and wrist in a cast. out of nowhere (though billy is aware conversation has stopped he does not look around)... costello sits down beside him at the bar. billy observes: mister french sitting down at a far table. watching. covering the room. costello is brought a glass of water by the silent bartender. no sound whatsoever in the bar. they say nothing, look at each other. billy notices delahunt and fitzy, entering. they stand by mister french. billy sits motionless.}
