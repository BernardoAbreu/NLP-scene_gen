<L>__{exterior parking lot of supermarket los angeles night}
<A>__{westwood. the parking lot of gelson's is nearly empty. eerie silence. suddenly some of the cars begin to shift in place from an unseen force. a small crack creases the asphalt and slowly crawls towards the brightly lit supermarket.}
<L>__{interior between aisles supermarket night}
<A>__{muzak is playing. kate and her boyfriend gordon are shopping late. she picks up some pull ups for lilly, gordon steps up behind her, wrapping his arms around her waist.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{why don't we make a baby?}
<A>__{he reaches up and touches her breasts.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{stop it! we're in public.}
<A>__{gordon lets go of her with mock disappointment.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{honey, i created them. and now suddenly i can't touch them?}
<A>__{kate pushes him away and moves on. a few customers are paying at the checkout stand. behind them: huge glass windows reveal cars slowly sliding into the ever widening crack in the parking lot. nobody inside notices. gordon catches up with kate.}
<C>__{gordon }
<D>__{you always act strange after he shows up?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{just because i don't care for your arrogant humor doesn't mean i'm acting strange. he is the father of my kids.}

<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(mockingly)}
<D>__{yeah, published! you know your mother was right. you've always been drawn to guys with lofty dreams and empty pockets. but not this time right, sweetheart?}
<A>__{kate smiles awkwardly and picks up a can of soup. the shelf in front of her shakes for a moment.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{did you see that?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{see what?}
<A>__{kate slowly puts the cans of soup into her cart and looks around. gordon senses a problem between them.}
<C>__{gordon }
<D>__{you know kate, we have to keep working at this... our relationship. because i won't end up being just a re run of you and jackson.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i mean honey, i feel like... something is pulling us apart?}
<A>__{before gordon finishes his sentence a violent roar! from front to back, the entire supermarket rips open right between kate and gordon. the few customers scream in horror at the sight of the huge crevasse forming beneath them. kate and gordon are thrown up against opposite aisles holding on for dear life. they cling to the columns as the shelves fold into the ever widening crack...}
