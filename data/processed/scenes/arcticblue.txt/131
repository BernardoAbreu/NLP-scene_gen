<A>__{corbett pulls his dead dinner inside.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{i need your pocket knife.}
<P>__{(eric hesitates)}
<D>__{i have to eat, too.}
<A>__{after a beat, eric pulls open the small blade on his swiss army knife and pushes it with his foot to corbett. smiling, corbett admires the fancy knife. then, below frame, he skins and guts his catch.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains. it continues, we better stay put.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{it could blow over tomorrow, too.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{i'm still figuring: you're either real brave or real dumb.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i just want this over with.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{where in hell meyerling dig you up?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you know meyerling?}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{sure. the people's friend. kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it.}
<A>__{corbett eats the squirrel eskimo style. raw. he uses the knife like a native, too, holding the meat in his teeth, then expertly cutting off a mouthful with a quick slice. eric stares, disgusted. off his look:}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{always eat your meat raw when the weather's cold. does you more good, long as the entrails look clean.}
<A>__{corbett uses snow and the squirrel's fur to wipe the blood from his face, then wipes the knife off and lays it, open, next to his leg.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i will hold onto that.}
<A>__{with a wry smile, corbett pushes it back over to eric. while eric eats his dinner, corbett listens to the storm and watches him eat.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{sure love to know where you fit in up here.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i'm here to do my job.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{you want to fool yourself about that bullshit job, fine. damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along. you think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man more }
<C>__{corbett }
<D>__{making your salary? look, i will give you five grand. take the money and go home where you both belong.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{don't fucking insult me.}
<A>__{corbett smiles maybe he's beginning to understand eric.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{folks come to alaska for a real short list of reasons: money. adventure. solitude. those cover most everyone. but frontiers also draw another type of man. one with a demon in his gut. he comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{yep. sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.}
<A>__{eric ponders corbett's words as he eats.}
