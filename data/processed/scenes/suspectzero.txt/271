<L>__{exterior service road dawn}
<A>__{hours have passed. dozens of law enforcement vehicles have arrived. sherrifs, feds. zero's rig remains on its side. mackelway sits nearby on a curb, his shattered wrist is in a sling. up above, the clouds have parted. morning sun streaks through. no more rain. fran sits beside him. at their feet, in the gutter of this service road, lies a discarded milk carton, covered with dust. the face under the "have you seen me?" is unknown to us. kathleen is nearby, holding charlie tight. cops surround them. an unmarked sedan arrives. charlton hurries out of it, making a bee line for mackelway.}

<D>__{nice work.}
<P>__{(mackelway half nods)}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{o'ryan. where is he?}
<A>__{mackelway rises, studies charlton. there's nothing to say. so he extends a hand to fran. she takes it, rising to her feet. they leave charlton behind... we pull away from them, craning up, taking in this expanse of tall wheat, tilting up to that morning sun.}
