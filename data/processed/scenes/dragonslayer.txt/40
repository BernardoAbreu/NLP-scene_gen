<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{forest path day valerian and galen trudge along side by side.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{how's your leg?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{hurts. that thing was small, but its teeth were sharp.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{at least you killed it. you got all the young.}
<A>__{this is small consolation, and galen sighs.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{but the big one's alive. somewhere down in that burning lake.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{don't think about it. you had your fight, and you're still here. that's more than anyone else can say. let's think about what lies ahead.}
<A>__{she reaches out to take his hand. but galen is no longer at her side. she stops and looks back.}
<B>__{galen}
<A>__{galen has come to a halt in the middle of the path. he's staring into the middle distance with a sudden inspiration bubbling in his brain. he flings off his sack, drops to his knees and tears through the contents. valerian comes back, baffled. galen's gear is strewn all over the trail.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{galen comes up with what he's looking for the leather sack. when he replies, it is not to her, but to ulrich:}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{you old trickster! the burning water! the lake of fire!}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{galen, what are you saying?}
<A>__{he regards her with astonishment.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{he had it planned. he knew this was going to happen.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{who did? what happened?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{we've got to go back, i want to talk to him!}
<A>__{he heads back down the trail, leaving his belongings on the road.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<A>__{she hurries after him.}
