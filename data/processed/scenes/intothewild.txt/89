<L>__{exterior orick beach day}
<A>__{we see chris foraging for firewood in the bluffs above the beach. he's got it tied to his back and his front. if we didn't know better, we'd think he was camouflaging himself. chris' pov: the rocks beside the water's edge. we see rainey sitting beside the water, staring out to sea. we follow chris' gaze to jan, some fifty yards down the beach, walking melancholically in the opposite direction of rainey. angle: rainey at the water's edge. chris appears beside him.}
<C>__{rainey}
<P>__{(regarding chris wrapped up in wood)}
<D>__{geez. if i struck a match to you, i'd have warmth and dinner at the same time.}
<A>__{but rainey's humor does not hide an inner turmoil.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{where's jan going?}
<C>__{rainey}
<D>__{well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front.}
<A>__{chris pulls out his pocketknife, cuts the twine that binds the firewood to his body, and takes a seat beside rainey.}
<C>__{rainey }
<D>__{you're an industrious little fucker, aren't ya... yeah, it's funny how things happen at particular times. i've loved that woman for a lot of years. but you know, she's got a...story. we've been going through this thing real quietly cause, well...so, after running into you last night, this thing we were going through quietly, she started talking about. you know what i mean?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{rainey}
<D>__{you think what?}
<A>__{chris is looking off at jan walking in the distance.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i think she's probably quietly disconnecting. it doesn't feel right to her to be close to you if there's a hole of some kind somewhere else.}
<C>__{rainey}
<D>__{that's a helluva insight. jesus!... you're not jesus, are you? you gonna walk on that water and get her back for me?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{actually, i'm a little afraid of water.}
<A>__{rainey gives him a sideways glance.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{it's true. but it's something i've got to get over sometime.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{so, i will swim in it if you'll carry the firewood back to the campsite.}
<C>__{rainey}
<D>__{i will carry. shit yes i will carry.}
<A>__{and with that, chris runs down the beach toward jan. rainey watches chris and jan chat briefly. then they strip down to their underwear and jump into the ocean, splashing and laughing. angle: rainey. a warmth comes over him, watching his old lady having some fun. he grabs two armfuls of wood and heads to the campsite. angle: chris and jan swimming in the chilly water, having a ball. jan increasingly indulges herself a motherly closeness and joy with chris. and chris allows it. she pushes the stringy hairs from his eyes, worries when he descends below the surface for too many seconds, and smiles and laughs in tender relief when from below surface one of her toes is pulled on by the big fish chris. as he re surfaces, she gives him a splash right in the face.}
