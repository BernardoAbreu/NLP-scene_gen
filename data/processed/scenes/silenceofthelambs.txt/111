<L>__{interior air national guard hanger memphis, tennessee day}
<A>__{close on dr. lecter. behind his mask, the alert, searching eyes.}
<C>__{crawford }
<D>__{he will...}
<B>__{officers pembry and boyle}
<A>__{two sturdy, well armed, veteran prison guards are checking dr. lecter's restraints with clever, careful fingers.}
<C>__{boyle}
<D>__{welcome to memphis, dr. lecter. i'm officer boyle, this is officer pembry. we aim to treat you just as nice as you treat us. act like a gentlemen, you'll get three hots and a cot.}
<C>__{pembry}
<D>__{but we ain't pussy footin' with you, buddy ruff. you get cute, try to bite somebody? we'll tie your asshole in a knot. you savvy?}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{oh yes, officer pembry. i certainly do.}
<A>__{the officers turn away, boyle signing a clipboarded form.}
<C>__{pembry}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{shit, he's just an ol' broke dick. won't be no trouble as all if he don't flip out.}
<C>__{boyle}
<D>__{dr. chilton...?}
<A>__{new angle wider as we see that we're in a vast, dusty hangar. parked to one side: an ems ambulance and four highway patrol cruisers; a dozen troopers stand quietly chatting and smoking over there. prentiss is pacing impatiently, casting anxious glances towards the open hanger doorway.}
<C>__{boyle}
<D>__{if you'll please sign right here, sir, we'll have us a legal transfer.}
<A>__{chilton instinctively pats his shirt pocket for his gold pen; it's gone. he searches other pockets, with growing unhappiness.}
<C>__{boyle}
<D>__{use mine.}
<C>__{pembry}
<D>__{here they come.}
<B>__{two black stretch limousines}
<A>__{glide smoothly into the hangar, stop. secret service agents pour out of the lead car, form a cordon. a driver opens the rear door of the second car, and krendler steps out, followed by the senator's assistant, with a briefcase, followed, as last, by the senator herself. barely glancing around, she strides towards lecter. new angle dr. lecter and sen. martin as she stops, struck by the bizarre spectacle of his restraints. the others instinctively keep a distance, but chilton, with theatrical relish, unstraps and removes dr. lecter's mask.}
<C>__{chilton}
<D>__{senator martin, meet dr. hannibal lecter.}
<A>__{they stare at one another for a long moment: the senator tense, almost haggard, the madman with his unearthly poise.}
<C>__{sen. martin}
<D>__{dr. lecter, i've brought an affidavit guaranteeing your new rights... you'll want to read it before i sign.}
<A>__{he assistant unsnaps his briefcase, reaches for the form.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{i won't waste your time and catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. clarice starling and that awful jack crawford have wasted far too much already. i only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... let me help you now, and i will trust you when it's all over.}
<C>__{sen. martin}
<D>__{you have my word. paul?}
<A>__{krendler raises a pad, poised to take notes.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{buffalo bill's real name is william rubin. i met him just once. he was referred to me in april or may, 1980, by my patient benjamin raspail. they were lovers, but raspail had become very frightened. apparently rubin had murdered a transient, and done things with the skin. he thought if i could cure billy, then billy'd be safe from the police, and he's be safe from billy... obviously, he was wrong.}
<C>__{krendler}
<D>__{we need his address, a physical descr }
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{did you nurse catherine?}
<C>__{sen. martin}
<P>__{(pause; startled)}
<D>__{what...?}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{did you breast feed her?}
<A>__{he flicks his tongue obscenely.}
<C>__{krendler}
<D>__{you son of a }
<A>__{the senator stills him with a hand. she is trembling.}
<C>__{sen. martin}
<D>__{yes... i did.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{toughened your nipples, didn't it...?}
<P>__{(a beat; then rapidly, bored)}
<D>__{six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. hair brown, eyes pale blue. he'd be about 35 now. he said he lived in philadelphia, but may have lied. that's really all i can remember, senator but if i think of any more, i will let you know.}
<C>__{sen. martin}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{let's go with it.}
<A>__{they start towards the car, but he calls out, stopping her.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{senator martin...! you can't trust jack crawford or clarice starling. it's such a game with these people. they're determined to get the arrest for themselves. the "collar," i think they say.}
<C>__{sen. martin}
<D>__{thank you, doctor. i will keep it in mind.}
<C>__{dr. lecter}
<D>__{oh, and senator...? love you suit.}
