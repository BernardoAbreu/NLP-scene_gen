<T>__{close on:}
<A>__{a tiny park, about half a metre square it has grass, tiny trees made from flowers, a small hole filled with water for a pond, park benches made with twigs and miniature wooden clothes peg people. ginty puts the finishing touches to the bandstand and sits back, staring in wonder. the moment is broken with the sound of hooves as her father appears, atop his horse.}

<D>__{ahhh, there's my girl.}
<A>__{the horse moves up to her.}
<C>__{travers }
<D>__{that's it albert. give ginty a smooch. there's a good boy, give her a little smooch.}

<C>__{ginty}
<D>__{why did she do that?!}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{because she hated the sound of his laugh.}

<D>__{do you want to know what it feels like to fly ginty?}
<A>__{she nods. he hauls himself onto albert, leans down and swings ginty up so she is facing him.}
<C>__{travers }
<D>__{you trust me?}
<A>__{she nods and wraps her arms around him looking backwards over his shoulder. he grips her firmly around the waist and she spreads her arms.}
<C>__{travers }
<D>__{gee up, albert. yah!}
<A>__{travers kicks the horse into a trot, then into a canter, he points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars.}
<C>__{travers }
<D>__{yah!}
<A>__{ginty squeals with delight.}
