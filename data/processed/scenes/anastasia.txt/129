<D>__{oh, dmitri.i wish that i could.}
<A>__{dmitri comes down the steps, then stops when he sees anya, wearing her crown. she turns and sees him, stifling her first impulse, then putting on a show of supreme confidence.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{i'm glad you found what you were looking for.}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{i'm glad you did too.}
<A>__{with nothing left to say, he heads for the door.}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{enjoy your fortune.}
<A>__{dmitri spins, but restrains. he opens the door and anya goes back into the parlor. they both know that they will never see each other again.}
