<L>__{interior exterior rooftop night}
<A>__{the rooftop has a spectacular view of the city. tracking with malik as he comes out of the elevator, rides to the far edge of the roof and slides to a stop. he looks down twenty stories. the second elevator arrives. the doors part and harry comes out, with his glock poised and ready. he sees malik revving his bike. the terrorist brodies the bike into a fast one eighty and speeds back toward the edge of the roof. amazingly, he increases speed, roaring right off the edge, arcing the bike suicidally out into space! harry rides to the edge in time to see malik, on his bike, clear a 60 foot jump and splash into the rooftop pool of a lower building next to the hotel! harry is out of control now, seeing the guy setting away. he wheels his mount and charges across the roof to get some running space. then he turns again, back toward the edge malik jumped from. he kicks the horse's flanks and yells haahh!! the horse's hoofs thunder on the roof as they go full tilt toward the edge. but a horse is not a motorcycle. it is slightly smarter. it slams its front hoofs down together, stopping suddenly. harry goes right over its head. he flies forward, almost going right off the roof. he slams to the edge, with his legs dangling over, holding onto a piece of pipe with one hand. his glock tumbles down into darkness. harry sees malik far below, climb out of the pool, running to the roof door of the other building. getting away. harry clambers up onto his own roof, breathing hard. he walks over to the horse.}
