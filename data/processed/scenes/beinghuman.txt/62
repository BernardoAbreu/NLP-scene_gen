<L>__{exterior farm day}
<A>__{hector and beatrice have found some privacy, near the trees and by a low wall. some bushes hide them from full view of the farm yard. hector is sitting cross legged and beatrice kneels behind him, giving his head a thorough going over. mutual grooming is the original, and perhaps the best, form of foreplay. hector certainly likes it.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{that's four.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{yes, it does feel good.}
<A>__{she gives his scalp a final delicious rub, and then stops.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{you can do me now.}
<A>__{beatrice loosens her clothing to bare her neck and shoulders. hector begins to probe her hair and scalp. she arches her back under the first touch of his fingers. hector laps it up, inspired to caress ever more tenderly her scalp and neck, still with the outward purpose of looking for fleas.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{got one... a tiny little one... yours are so small... and fair...}
<A>__{to hector even her fleas are a delight. he seems to want to keep it as a pet. there is no hope for this man. beatrice moans softly, happily. hector still kneading her scalp.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i don't know your name. i'm hector... who are you? i'm hector.}
<A>__{beatrice replies with a hint of breathlessness.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{hector... yes... i'm beatrice...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{beatrice.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{yes. hector... i think you'll have to do under my arms... i'm a little itchy there...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{yes, i think beatrice is a good name.}
<A>__{beatrice is sighing contentedly now.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{maybe we should find the river, and have a proper wash...}
<A>__{in between parting the hairs on her scalp hector is kiss ing her on the neck now. at first it is small, snatched kisses amongst the grooming, but soon the kisses become longer and the grooming less.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{i'm still itchy lots of places, hector.}
