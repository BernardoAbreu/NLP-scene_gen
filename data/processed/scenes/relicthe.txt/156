<D>__{dr. frock, i was wondering. what happened to the rest of whittlesley's plants?}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{they were sent to the center for disease control in atlanta.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{the virus itself might have positive applications. they'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.}

<D>__{greg isn't joining us?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{he's changed. he's always working on his thesis. he comes in early, stays late. i tried to get him to join us, but he never takes a break.}
<A>__{they pause on a new diorama. it's huge, filling one entire end of the hall. in the center is a life sized representation of mbwun standing on the tepui amid the plants. behind is a painting of john whittlesley as he once was. he wears the necklace with the two arrows, of silver and gold. as margo looks, she touches her own. pendergast turns to her, sympathy in his eyes.}

<D>__{we did the right thing, margo.}
<A>__{margo smiles warmly.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{yes. i know.}
