<A>__{grace grabs a hold of the railing and starts climbing the stairs. after a few steps, she stops to rest, wheezing. with the help of the railing, grace pulls herself up to the gap in the staircase. in one forceful exertion, she propels her body up and forward. the railing instantly becomes separated from the wall. grace lands in a heap. luckily, the top half of her body made it to the other side. with all of her might, grace pulls herself up to the landing.}
