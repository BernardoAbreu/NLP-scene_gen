<A>__{we can't read all of them; some are too faded (or the "gravestones" themselves too degenerated), but we can see now that this woodland clearing's a rather eerie and well populated animal graveyard. we can see: polynesia, 1953 and hannah the best dog that ever lived. hannah's tombstone is part of an old chevrolet hood, painstakingly hammered flat.}

<A>__{from here we can see most of the clearing, which is surrounded by forest pines. we can see that the graves maybe 80 in all are arranged in rough concentric circles. on the far side of this clearing is the end of a path which spills into this graveyard clearing. the end of the path is flanked by wooden poles which hold up a crude arch. we can see no writing on this side the words on the arch face those arriving along the path.}
