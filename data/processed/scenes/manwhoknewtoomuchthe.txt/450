<A>__{a high camera shows us a large hallway and ornate ballroom. as yet the room is about quarter filled and various guests of the diplomatic corps and others are gradually adding to the group. the camera dollies down over them until it reaches slightly open doorway. peering cautiously through we see the face of drayton.}
