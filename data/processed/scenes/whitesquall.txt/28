<L>__{interior chart house dusk}
<A>__{the chart house is the communication and navigation center for the boat. it also serves as the officers dining room. skipper, alice, lawford, george, and bill butler sit around the small table sipping coffee.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{we're awfully quiet tonight.}
<A>__{the group remains silent. lawford and george exchange a glance. skipper catches it.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{something on your mind, george?}
<A>__{george looks up and wipes his mouth with a napkin.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i think you were too hard on weathers.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes. i do.}
<A>__{skipper nods.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{i need to know what i'm working with; what their boundaries are. their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours. we've got to bring them together. make them a crew. we're as strong as our weakest link and i don't want to find that out the hard way. so, i will challenge them and they will come together.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{you know the best thing about being a skipper is the worst thing. it's all my responsibility. so i will tell you what george, you stay off of my bridge, and i will stay out of your galley. we'll get along that way.}
<A>__{everyone's quiet, but clear. skipper and alice exit.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{fucking bastard.}
<A>__{lawford lets out a belly laugh.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{i've seen him snatch the tail of the tempest and stuff it, screaming, into a bottle. the bilges are full of them.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{he's been beyond the reach. to the edge of the abyss and back. he'll do well by us all george. he's a real salt. there's no malice in him and there's nothing more dear to him than his boys. so sleep well my friend.}
<A>__{lawford seductively produces a pair of havana cigars, passes one to george and winks.}
