<A>__{seth and laura in the good sized criminal lab. loaded with up to date equipment. seth has drawn a picture of the crime scene. words like "bedroom door," "exit window," "vault," "bed," "victim" are written neatly to scale. he holds a sheaf of papers. it's late afternoon and things are already getting crazed. noise in the b.g. throughout.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{see if any of this makes sense.}
<A>__{seth mimes opening the "bedroom door," stepping inside, closing it. he makes a click with his tongue.}
