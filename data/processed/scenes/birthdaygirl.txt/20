<L>__{interior airport lift day}
<A>__{nadia and john stand side by side in a huge lift.}

<D>__{we can talk in the car.}
<A>__{a deafening roll of thunder.}
<L>__{exterior airport car park day}
<A>__{it's pouring with rain as they cross the car park towards a patched up yellow rover. john stows the suitcase in the boot and opens the passenger door for her.}
<L>__{interior exterior john's car (moving) day}
<A>__{john turns the key in the ignition. the mg wheezes and coughs. he tries again. nothing. the third time it just catches and he coaxes it to life. the colour's drained from his cheeks. they head for the motorway. the silence in the car lasts just long enough for john to feel he is breaking it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's about forty miles from here. i don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to london but it's a city in itself. a roman city. it's a nice house. i'm having a problem with ants. i uh... it's the warmer weather. i can't seem to find the nest. sorry, do you understand "ants"?}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i just can't find a nest. the root of the problem. i've looked everywhere. what's the russian for ant? sorry that's a stupid... sorry. this is strange isn't it.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm pretty nervous. are you?}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i mean... "ants." "i've got a problem with ants."}
<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i had this...}
<A>__{he pulls a sign from his jacket which says "nadia!"}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{as a joke but uh...}
<A>__{he tosses it onto the back seat. they drive. he sees nadia looking at england.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so. is it different to how you imagined it?}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i bet.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what about me? am i how you imagined?}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{he double takes, changes lanes.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{and how was the flight. sorry, am i speaking too fast for you?}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{john looks across.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{do uh... sorry. can you follow me? do you understand what i'm saying?}
<C>__{nadia}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{do you follow or should i speak slower?}
<C>__{nadia}

<A>__{he looks across. back at the road. he changes gear.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{uh... are you a giraffe?}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{john turns to face the road ahead.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{oh jesus.}
<A>__{he drives in silence.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh jesus.}
<A>__{suddenly she winds the window down and vomits out of the speeding car. john panics and swerves onto the hard shoulder amidst loud horn blasts.}
