<L>__{exterior janes scenic drive a little while later}
<A>__{laroche parks. kaufman parks behind him. orlean gestures with her gun for him to get out. as kaufman comes around the car, he sees donald on the floor of the back seat. laroche emerges from his van with a flashlight and a rifle slung over his shoulder. orlean prods kaufman to follow him. kaufman shakes and whimpers as they all step down into the thigh high water. they slog through silently. laroche stops.}
<C>__{laroche}
<D>__{this spot looks good.}
<P>__{(thinking aloud)}
<D>__{now how do we do this? hit him in the head with a rock first? keeping in mind we can only hit him once and only with as much force as would be created by him slipping and falling onto the rock.}
<A>__{laroche paces. orlean finds a place to sit on a hammock. she unwraps a small square of paper and snorts something out of it. kaufman shivers. orlean's drugs kick in.}
<C>__{orlean}
<D>__{holy jesus. holy... hey, baby, hey...}
<A>__{orlean trails off. laroche talks to the spaced out orlean.}
<C>__{laroche}
<D>__{should we drown him, then hit him on the head? uh uh. a body bleeds different if the heart's stopped. these new forensic guys are very smart. we really have to know our corpses to stand a chance: rigor mortis, lividity, putrefecation, ocular changes.}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{maybe you think we hit him on the head and force water into his lungs after he's dead? no, darlin'. they'll know he didn't drown. see, contrary to popular belief, the lungs do not do not fill with water in a drowning. what happens is, choking causes an irritation of the mucous membranes. this creates a shitload of mucus in the windpipe. efforts to breathe turn the mucus into a sticky foam which may or may not mix with vomit. it's the presence of this white foam that indicates drowning. there's a lot to be aware of, susie. shoeprints, hair, microscopic fibers. tire tracks. they all tell a tale to today's forensic scientists.}
<P>__{(to kaufman)}
<D>__{what do you think? you're a writer. how would you do it? what's a good way to kill somebody?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i don't write this kind of bullshit.}
<C>__{laroche}
<D>__{don't get all huffy, i was simply }
<A>__{suddenly laroche gets whacked in the back, flies forward into the water. orlean looks up, spaced. she's confused by a second kaufman standing there with a bag of potting soil. donald grabs kaufman and they run back toward the road. laroche pulls himself from the water.}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{fuck!}
<C>__{orlean}
<P>__{(receptively)}
<D>__{yeah, let's, baby.}
<A>__{she staggers moonily toward laroche. he pushes her away.}
<C>__{laroche}
<D>__{not now. we got to kill that guy. and now i guess that other guy as well.}
<C>__{orlean}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{ohhh.}
