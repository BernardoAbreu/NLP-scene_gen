<L>__{exterior gas station night}
<A>__{mitchell is videotaping the bus with a portable camcorder. the bus is badly damaged, though essentially intact. most of the windows in the rear have gone. there is a ghostly quality to this image, as though the video light is searching through the remains of an ancient shipwreck. mitchell turns off the camcorder and stands in the silent night, absorbing the disturbing energy of the bus. he hears a truck approaching the garage from the distance. it's billy ansel. mitchell retreats to his parked car as billy stops his truck in front of the bus and steps out of the truck. billy leaves his headlights on, and they cast dark shadows over the inside passenger seats. billy stares at the bus a long time. mitchell approaches him.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{i'm here about your children, mr. ansel.}
<A>__{billy takes a moment, then turns around to face mitchell. the two men stare at each other.}
<C>__{mitchell }
<D>__{my name is...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{mister, i don't want to know your name.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{no you don't.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{i can help you.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{not unless you can raise the dead.}
<A>__{mitchell hands billy a card.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{here. you may change your mind.}
<A>__{billy looks at the card.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{mr. mitchell stephens, esquire, would you be likely to sue me if i was to beat you right now? beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month. because that's what i'm about to do.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{no, mr. ansel. i wouldn't sue you.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{leave us alone, stephens. leave the people of this town alone. you can't help.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{you can help each other. several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. your case as an individual will be stronger if i'm allowed to represent you together as a group.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{case?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{the walkers have agreed. the ottos. nicole burnell's parents. it's important to initiate proceedings right away. things get covered up. people lie. that's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. before the evidence disappears. that's why i'm out here tonight.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i know risa and wendell walker. they wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer. and the ottos wouldn't deal with you. we're not country bumpkins you can put a big city hustle on. you're trying to use us.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{you're angry, mr. ansel. you owe it to yourself to feel that way. all i'm saying is let me direct your rage.}
<A>__{billy stares at mitchell with a cold intensity. the cell phone in mitchell's car begins to ring.}
<C>__{mitchell }
<D>__{that's my daughter. or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead. she's a drug addict.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{why are you telling me this?}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{i'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, mr. ansel.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{they're dead to us. they kill each other in the streets. they wander comatose in shopping malls. they're paralyzed in front of televisions. something terrible has happened that's taken our children away. it's too late. they're gone.}
<A>__{the phone continues to ring, as billy stares at mitchell. mitchell turns to look at the ringing phone.}
