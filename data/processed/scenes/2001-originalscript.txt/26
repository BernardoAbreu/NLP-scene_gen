<D>__{there's been a failure in the pod bay doors. lucky you weren't killed.}
<A>__{the computer brain consists of hundreds of transparent perspex rectangles, half an inch thick, four inches long and two and a half inches high. each rectangle contains a center of fine grid of wires upon which the information is programmed. bowman begins pulling these memory blocks out. they float in the weightless condition of the brain room.}

<D>__{hey, dave, what are you doing?}
<A>__{bowman works swiftly.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{hey, dave. i've got ten years of service experience and an irreplaceable amount of time and effort has gone into making me what i am.}

"daisy, daisy, give me your answer do. i'm half; crazy all for the love of you..."}
<A>__{computer continues to sing song becoming more and more childish and making mistakes and going off key. it finally stops completely. bowman goes to ans area marked "emergency power and life support". he keys some switches and we see the lights go on. nearby, another board "emergency manual controls". he goes to this board and keys "close pod bay doors", "close air lock doors", etc. we see various doors closing.}
<B>__{pod bay}
<A>__{bowman in space suit obtains new alignment telescope, new azimuth component. bowman in pod exits pod bay.}
