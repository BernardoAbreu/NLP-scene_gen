<A>__{...we hear what we will come to know as the voice of the}
<B>__{guide.}
<C>__{guide voice}
<A>__{it is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. a small square image appears on screen. home video. the dolphin stadium at sea world.}
<C>__{guide voice }
<A>__{for instance, on the planet earth, man had always assumed that he was the most intelligent species occupying the planet, instead of the third most intelligent which was, in fact, entirely accurate. the dolphins perform; leaping through hoops, etc.}
<C>__{guide voice }
<A>__{the second most intelligent creatures were, of course, dolphins who curiously enough had long known of the impending destruction of the planet earth. they had made many attempts to alert mankind to the danger, but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually decided they would leave earth by their own means. they leap madly, desperately. higher and higher...}
<C>__{guide voice }
<A>__{the last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double backward somersault through a hoop while whistling the "star spangled banner" but in fact the message was this... "so long and thanks for all the fish." titles roll (full screen 35mm images) dolphins leap over and interact with the opening titles. breathtaking somersaults, back flips, choreographed to a buzby berkley style song called, "so long and thanks for all the fish." we end with a wide shot of all the dolphins jumping out of the top of frame, but they never come back down. tilt up to a starry night sky the dolphins have vanished.}

<A>__{as night turns to morning, we hear click, then...}

<A>__{close on the clock radio from which the voice emanates. a hand shuts it off. arthur dent is awake. 30's. kind faced. his feet land perfectly in slippers as he stands and shuffles out of his very neat but very boring room. in the bathroom arthur gargles in front of the mirror. he bends over to spit revealing a yellow bulldozer through the window, crawling toward his house. a tea}
<B>__{kettle whistles o.s.}
<L>__{interior arthur dent's kitchen continuous}
<A>__{arthur sets the newspaper (with the headline "dolphins vanish") on the table, removes the kettle. doesn't notice through the window 3 more large yellow bulldozers. he pours a cup of tea, sets the pot down next o his mobile phone. he picks it up, stares at a digital photo on the screen of himself and a very pretty woman (tricia) at a costume party. he presses the phone to his head as if it were a cold compress. suddenly, there's a loud rumbling o.s. the tea cup rattles. arthur looks out the window. now he sees the bulldozers. the tea cup shatters on the floor.}

<L>__{exterior arthur dent's house morning}
<A>__{arthur, dressed in pajamas and robe, lies in the dirt in front of a bulldozer, blocking it from destroying his house. he yells into his mobile phone.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{what do you mean he's gone out to lunch? you just said he was still at breakfast!}
<A>__{mr. prosser, a bureaucrat, leans over him.}
<C>__{prosser}
<D>__{come off it, mr. dent. you can't lie in front of the bulldozers forever.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i'm game. we'll see who rusts first.}
<C>__{prosser}
<D>__{this bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built. you should have made your protest months ago.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{the first i heard of it was when a workman came yesterday. i asked if he'd come to clean the windows, and he said he'd come to demolish the house. he didn't tell me right away of course. first he wiped a couple of windows and charged me twenty quid. then he told me.}
<A>__{the bulldozer driver, looking guilty, ducks behind the steering wheel. prosser removes plans from his briefcase.}
<C>__{prosser}
<D>__{look. these plans have been on display at the planning office now for a year.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{on display? i had to go down to a cellar!}
<C>__{prosser}
<D>__{that's the display department.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i eventually found them in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'beware of the leopard'.}
<C>__{prosser}
<D>__{mr. dent, have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if i just let it roll straight over you?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{prosser}
<D>__{none at all.}
<C>__{ford }
<P>__{(american accent)}
<D>__{arthur!}
<A>__{arthur and prosser turn to see a man cresting a hill, pushing a shopping cart which is filled with beer and bags of peanuts. this is ford prefect. wiry, intense. as he heads downhill, he leaps up and rides the cart down towards arthur's house like a kid in a supermarket. he rolls right past arthur and the bulldozers.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{ford?}
<A>__{he leaps off, drags the cart to a full stop.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{arthur! there you are. here drink and eat with me. we need to talk.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{er, um...now's not the best time, ford they're going to demolish my home,}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{whoa. you already know? how?}
<A>__{arthur simply motions to the bulldozer.}
<C>__{ford }
<D>__{oh. when you say "they" you mean they. got it. listen, i gotta tell you something important, and i gotta tell you now.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{but what about my house?}
<A>__{ford looks to prosser who is conferring with the bulldozer driver. he pushes the cart over to him. arthur watches as ford gestures to prosser who waves his hand and the all the 'dozer engines die. the bulldozer drivers step down, start drinking the beer and eating the peanuts. ford returns to arthur.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{c'mon. let's go to the pub. he said they won't destroy your house until they've finished the beers.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{can we trust him?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i'd trust him to the end of the earth.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{and how far's that?}
<C>__{ford}

<D>__{six pints of bitter. and quickly. the world's about to end.}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{oh yes, sir? nice weather for it.}
<A>__{he starts to pull pints. ford shoves bar peanuts into his pockets while arthur shouts into his phone...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{well, when does he get back from lunch? or is he going straight out for tea?!}
<A>__{he shuts the phone, sits, looking forlorn.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{this is shaping up to be a crap day.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{it's about to get a lot crappier.}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{there you are, six pints.}
<A>__{ford slaps down a 50 note. the barman's impressed.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{keep the change. you've got ten minutes to spend it.}
<A>__{ford pushes three pints in front of arthur.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{three? at lunchtime?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{time is an illusion. lunchtime doubly so.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{very deep. you should send that in to the reader's digest. they've got a page for people like you.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{drink up.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{why three pints?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{muscle relaxant.}
<P>__{(grabbing more peanuts)}
<D>__{and eat these. you'll need the salt.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what's going on. ford?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{what would you say if i told you i wasn't really from guilford but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of eetelgeuse?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{why, is it the sort of thing you're likely to say?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{remember when we met? that car was racing toward me, i was trying to greet it, you pushed me out of the way?}
<T>__{quick cut to a street :}
<A>__{ mid day ford stands in the middle of the road, extending a hand to a fast approaching car. arthur drops his shopping, dives at him and tackles him out of the way as the car zooms past.}
<T>__{back to ford in the pub:}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{didn't you find it a little strange that i was trying to shake hands with a car?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i assumed you were drunk.}
<C>__{ford}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{i thought cars were the dominant life form. i was trying to introduce myself.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{and that's why you're named after a discontinued car from the seventies?}
<C>__{ford}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{you saved my life that day. now i'm saving yours.}
<A>__{arthur just stares at him, then turns to his beer.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{this must be thursday. i never could get the hang of thursdays.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{look, if it's about your house...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{no, it's not that. it's....}
<A>__{he shows ford the photo of he and tricia on his phone.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{i found her. ford. the perfect girl. i found her, and then i let her get away. you remember that fancy dress party i told you about?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{this isn't a long story, is it? we've only got six minutes.}
<A>__{arthur shakes his head. ford checks his watch.}
<C>__{ford }
<D>__{okay. talk and drink. fancy dress party.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{at that flat in islington. i told you about it. last week, remember?}
<T>__{flashback to:}
<L>__{interior islington flat night}
<A>__{crowded flat. everyone is in costume. loud music blares.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{i can't bear those sort of parties, didn't want to go, would have much rather stayed home and, i don't know, brush the dog. anything. but there i was and then, there she was...}
<A>__{arthur, dressed in safari attire complete with pith helmet, sits off to the side, observing, looking miserable.}
<C>__{tricia }
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{arthur looks up. tricia mcmillan is dressed in a mid}

<C>__{arthur}

<D>__{no, i mean who are you?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{oh, the costume. right. er, um...}
<P>__{(sheepishly tipping his hat)}
<D>__{livingston, i presume.}
<P>__{(pointing to her attire)}
<D>__{granted. not as clever as darwin, but the best i could do on short notice.}
<C>__{tricia}
<D>__{you're the first person who's got it right. everyone keeps calling me sherlock.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{really? i thought the beagle made it rather obvious.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{really? i thought the beagle made it rather obvious.}
<A>__{he pets the dog. she smiles. he smiles back. a camera flash flashes. jump cut : to... the balcony arthur has just taken a digital photo of he and tricia on his cell phone. they look at the screen image and laugh.}
<D>__{arthur (v.o.) (cont'd) she was amazing, ford. witty, and beautiful, and brilliant. four or five degrees. one in math, one in astrophysics, another in biology...}
<C>__{tricia}
<D>__{i've got so many degrees i am officially unemployable. let's drink to that!}
<A>__{they clink their wine glasses, take sips, continue to chat.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{and just as i was asking myself, "why is this stunning and intelligent woman even giving me the time of day, out of nowhere she says...}
<C>__{tricia}
<D>__{let's go somewhere.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{yeah. it is a bit noisy. there's a lovely little cafe around the corner...}
<C>__{tricia}
<D>__{i was thinking madagascar.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{is that a new club on dean street?}
<C>__{tricia}
<D>__{no. it's a country. off the coast of africa.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{oh, that madagascar. right, off we go then.}
<P>__{(then realizing...)}
<D>__{good god, you're serious.}
<A>__{she nods. arthur isn't sure how to react.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{well...that's...an extraordinary proposition. but...i can't just up and go. what about my job?}
<C>__{tricia}
<D>__{quit. get a new one when we return.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i can't just...what about my house? who would feed my dog?}
<C>__{tricia}
<D>__{bring him with.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{he's a welsh collie. he'd feel all out of place in madagascar.}
<A>__{trillian forces a smile, clearly disappointed.}
<C>__{zaphod }
<D>__{you don't want to go to madagascar.}
<A>__{they both turn to face zaphod beeblebrox very charming, extremely handsome whose attire seems very "other worldly." knee high boots, a yellow sash...}
<C>__{zaphod }
<D>__{hi. i'm zaphod beeblebrox, president of the galaxy of course, you probably already know that. i'm headed for a lost and distant planet. would you like to see my spaceship?}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{i went to refresh our drinks. when i came back, she was gone.}
<L>__{exterior back ik the pub continuous}

<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{"would you like to see my spaceship?" really, what sort of chat up line is that?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{more popular than you'd think.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i've left messages, sent letters... it's like she's vanished off the face of the earth.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{hey, it happens. speaking of...}
<P>__{(pulling a blinking electronic device from his satchel)}
<D>__{we've got two minutes. so drink up.}

<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{my house!}
<A>__{he runs out. ford rises, grabs two handfuls of peanuts from the bowl, tosses the barman all the money in his pocket.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{a round for everyone, on me.}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{you really think the world's going to end?}
<P>__{(ford nods)}
<D>__{shouldn't we lie down or put a bag over our heads or something?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{if you want.}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{will it help?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{not really.}

<A>__{arthur runs up the road towards his house which is being bulldozed. ford strides casually behind in the distance.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{stop! stop, you bastards!!}
<A>__{arthur suddenly stops running and covers his ears as we hear the loudest rumble in motion picture history. a gigantic yellow spaceship (picture a concrete tower block)) sweeps overhead. ford hits the deck. arthur is blown sideways. trees are uprooted. ford rises and hurries to the rubble that was arthur's house. he digs around near the exposed toilet and comes up with a towel. he hurries to arthur's side. another ship screams over, blowing them down again. rain is knocked out of the clouds and lands in one big thwump! everywhere is soaked.}

<C>__{ford}
<D>__{ships from a vogon constructor fleet. i picked up their signal this morning.}
<A>__{he shows arthur his blinking sens 0 matic device.}

<A>__{several patrons watch the wall of tv's, all projecting a snowy, distorted image. jeltz's voice blares through the speakers.}
<C>__{jeltz}
<D>__{...and, unfortunately, your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. the process will take slightly less than two of your earth minutes. thank you.}

<D>__{hello! can you hear us? please respond!}
<L>__{interior vogon constructor ship bridge continuous}
<A>__{the vogon bridge is like a waterlogged old skoda.}
<C>__{jeltz }
<D>__{there's no point in acting all surprised about it. the plans and demolition orders have been on display at your local planning office in alpha centauri for fifty of your earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge formal complaints.}

<P>__{(through juke box)}
<D>__{what do you mean you've never been to alpha centauri? oh, for heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know. i'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's your own lookout.}

<A>__{jeltz turns. he's large, green and walrusy.}

<A>__{one of his walrusy first officers pushes a yellow button.}
<B>__{big shot. from space. looking down on earth}
<A>__{as all the vogon ships simultaneously send down a beam of yellow light. glowing fireballs travel down the beams toward earth. on impact, they bore into the surface.}
<C>__{jeltz }
<D>__{detonate.}
<A>__{like a giant casino going down in vegas, there are a few small explosions amd the earth implodes. just collapses in on itself. gone. the vogon ships slowly retreat in formation, leaving nothing but darkness and stars. then a distant red glow appears. as it gets nearer we see that it says..."the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy."}
<C>__{guide voice}
<D>__{the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy is a wholly remarkable book...}
<A>__{the title draws nearer. we see that it sits on an electronic book with lots of buttons.}
<C>__{guide voice }
<D>__{...perhaps the most remarkable, certainly the most successful book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of ursa minor.}
<A>__{the book opens revealing two screens. images appear. a star map, layers of data, captions, video, animations...}
<C>__{guide voice }
<D>__{more popular than the celestial home care omnibus, better selling than 53 more things to do in zero gravity, and more controversial than oolon colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters, where god went wrong, some more of god's greatest mistakes, and who is this god person, anyway?}
<A>__{now the images rise up from the screen like holographs as the book "presents itself" like some hi tech infomercial.}
<C>__{guide voice }
<D>__{in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the outer eastern rim of the galaxy, the hitchhiker's guide has already supplanted the great encyclopedia galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom. for though it has many omissions, and contains much which is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. first, it is slightly cheaper. and second, it has the words "don't panic" printed in large friendly letters on its cover.}
<A>__{the book closes. the words "don't panic" appear just below the title, blinking like a tacky diner marquee. pull back from the guide to find arthur holding it, the blinking light illuminating his very disoriented face.}

<A>__{arthur, in total shock, holds up the guide.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so you're not from guilford, which would explain the accent which i've always wondered about...and you're not an out of work actor but rather a writer for this...this...book thing.}
<A>__{ford nods. arthur rubs his weary brow.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{i don't feel well. i need a cup of tea.}
<A>__{ford hands him a fistful of peanuts.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{here. eat these. if you've never been through a transmat beam before you've probably lost some salt and protein.}
<A>__{arthur eats some peanuts, sits up, squints. ford feels his way around the room, looking for something.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{if i asked where we were would i regret}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{we're safe. for now.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{we're in a storage hold in one of the ships of the vogon constructor fleet ...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{obviously some strange usage of the word safe i wasn't previously aware of.}
<C>__{ford}
<P>__{(not getting the sarcasm)}
<D>__{is it?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{tell me you're joking.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{okay. i'm joking.}

<A>__{ford does a reassuring little laugh.}

<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{oh god it was demolished! i've got to reach my lawyer! he must be back from lunch by now...}
<A>__{he pulls out his cell phone. desperately punches numbers. ford flips on a light switch, revealing a messy chamber full of alien junk and old mattresses.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{you don't remember, do you?}
<P>__{(taking his cell phone)}
<D>__{okay. i've got something to tell you. it ain't gonna be easy, but you're gonna have to just deal, okay?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{good god. is this really the interior of a flying saucer?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{yeah. why?}
<A>__{shot: deep space. the vogon fleet in flight}

<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{blown up? blown up?! couldn't you have done something?!!}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i did. i saved you.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{but there's six billion other people.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{and all those ants.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{yes, but ants aren't exactly people!}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{and now you're thinking like a vogon.}
<P>__{(before arthur can respond)}
<D>__{i saved your life, okay? which makes us even. next thing.}
<A>__{ford throws arthur a towel. arthur looks confused.}
<C>__{ford }
<D>__{it's a tough galaxy. you want to survive out here, you really gotta know where your towel is. now gimme a hand over here.}
<A>__{arthur joins ford near a rusty ventilation pipe.}
<C>__{ford }
<D>__{careful, it's hot.}
<A>__{he slides the towel behind the pipe, holding each end of it, arthur does the same.}
<C>__{ford }
<D>__{we've got to get off this ship before the vogons find us. vogons hate hitchhikers. which is why they make ships with walls that won't allow the sub etna signal to pass through. so we've got to send the signal up and out if we wanna catch a ride. pull.}
<A>__{they both pull. a section of pipe snaps off. steam shoots out. ford holds the black thumb under the pipe.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what's a vogon?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{ask the guide. say "vogons."}
<A>__{ford continues turning dials. arthur lifts the guide.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{"vogons."}

<C>__{guide voice}
<D>__{vogons.}
<A>__{character, history, how to have fun with, how to annoy, what to avoid. arthur touches character.}
<C>__{guide voice }
<D>__{vogons are one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy not evil, but bad tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. they wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as fire lighters.}

<A>__{no. arthur didn't know that. he looks perplexed.}

<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{that's bureaucracy for you.}

<C>__{benjy mouse}

<C>__{benjy mouse}
<D>__{about this ultimate question. you see, we've been offered a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5d tv chat show and lecture circuit, and quite frankly, we're very much inclined to take it.}
<C>__{franky mouse}
<D>__{but and here's the point we have to have product. which means we still need an ultimate question.}
<C>__{benjy mouse}
<D>__{or at least, one that sounds ultimate.}
<C>__{franky house}
<D>__{yes. got to sound good.}

<C>__{franky mouse}
<D>__{and as it turns out, the chances are astronomically high that the structure of the question is encoded in your brain. which is why we need it. more tea? franky tries to pour more tea. arthur stops drinking, a little woozy. did he hear them right?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i'm sorry did you just say you need my brain?}
<C>__{benjy mouse}
<D>__{yes. to extract the question.}

<D>__{barely.}

<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i would!}
<C>__{franky mouse}
<D>__{no, you wouldn't. we could program you not to. arthur tries to get up. clamps spring up from the chair and wrap around his arms. a dome flips over from the back and slams down on his head. arthur struggles.}

<C>__{benjy mouse}
<D>__{don't worry. you won't feel a thing. the mice on the platter move ominously toward arthur. arthur, still attached to the chair, backs away. scythes and rotating arms with circular saw blades shoot out ominous surgical equipment to remove his brain.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{wait a minute, just wait a sodding minute!! the scythes and arms stop spinning. arthur stumbles backwards and sits down in the chair. the others stop eating and listen.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{you want the question that goes with the answer "42" how about "what's six times seven?" or "how many vogons does it take to screw in a lightbulb?" or here's one, "how many roads must a man walk down?"}
<C>__{benjy mouse}
<D>__{hey, that's not bad. through the opposite window (in much the same way bulldozers arrived in the opening) we see more vogons arriving.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{fine. take it. there's plenty more where that came from because my head is filled, with questions, and i can assure you mate, no answer to any of them has ever brought me one iota of happiness. confusion? yes. indecision? loads. but happiness...? he shakes his head.}
