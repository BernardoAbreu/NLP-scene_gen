<L>__{interior gynecologist's office day}
<A>__{debbie sits in dr. pelligrino's office.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{no, you said it was impossible.}
<C>__{dr. pelligrino}
<D>__{i don't think i said it was impossible.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{dr. pelligrino}
<D>__{i usually don't say impossible. i like to leave some wiggle room.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you said that my fibroid was like a giant boulder, like the one from the indiana jones movies blocking up my uterus.}
<C>__{dr. pelligrino}
<D>__{and i need to stop using that reference of indiana jones. i think that's not appropriate when talking about the reproductive system.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<C>__{dr. pelligrino}
<D>__{anyway, somehow the eastern medicine has worked and the fibroid has dissipated.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{that's great.}
<C>__{dr. pelligrino}
<D>__{yes. your fibroid shrunk, and somehow it allowed you to get pregnant.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dr. pelligrino}
<D>__{you're going to have your third baby. congratulations.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{dr. pelligrino}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{debbie does not react.}
<C>__{dr. pelligrino }
<D>__{would you like some water?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{that's good news. another baby, at forty.}
<C>__{dr. pelligrino}
<D>__{debbie?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i am thrilled. and pete is going to be so happy.}
<C>__{dr. pelligrino}
<D>__{so, you're okay?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{what a relief. i can finally relax now, you know? i'm so happy, i really am. it's good.}
