<A>__{a tableau of impending danger. thick black oil bleeds from teh truck onto the street...pouring underneath the rig...and into the manhole. police urgently cordon off the area, evacuating the workers. emergency personnel deal with the badly injured truck driver. firemen wedge sandbags between the hull of the truck and the three quarters covered manhole trying to divert the oil away from the underground vault. fire commander o'connell yells at his men to finish the job and get the hell away. the big trucks arrive. pumper engine and frank's ladder truck rapidly guided into position by men on the ground. frank, gibson, butch and the rest of the unit are on the ground instantly and ready for orders. they are looking at a nightmare ready to happen. frank takes in everything. fire commander o'connell and a con ed supervisor approach.}

<D>__{a fun one.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{we got high voltage cables ripped loose in the underground. they hit water, that fault's gonna arc.}
<A>__{frank looks at the tanker over the manhole. there is now nobody around it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{why haven't they killed the juice?}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{switches are shorted out.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're shitting me!}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{wish i was. oldest part of the system down there. we're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we gotta go underground. get those guys out, now.}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{we tried. bulkhead door's rusted shut. won't budge.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{the block is being evacuated. i don't want anybody... including our boys...within fifty yards of that tanker...it's a fucking bomb.}
<A>__{frank has been staring at the capsized rig. butch knows what he's thinking. but it's too late. frank is gone...slogging through the oozing oil to the hull of the tanker. he kneels over the three quarters covered manhole, using a flashlight to peer into the darkness below. sparks from the loose cables spit off flashes of light as the cables hiss and slap against the ceiling and walls of the vault.}

<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{there's a manhole at canal and bowery.}
<C>__{butch's voice}
<D>__{forget it, frank. no way you reach those men in time.}
<A>__{frank grabs a "halaghan claw tool" and a walkie talkie. gibson nervously picks out two helmet lights...and they are off and running.}
<C>__{frank}
