<P>__{(checklisting)}
<D>__{towels, red ribbon, handkerchiefs... how’re the tennis balls coming?}
<A>__{ryan and dr. lesh are painting numbers on each of six tennis balls and then carefully signing their names. string hangs across the ceiling and to each wall coming together in the air six feet above the floor to form a square. steve runs in with several pounds of rope slung around his shoulder.}

<D>__{it’s all i could find.}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{it’ll do. how’s the bath water doin’?}

<D>__{then i don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t get started.}
<P>__{(to diane)}
<D>__{all right, honey. call out to her.}
<A>__{in the low light of the living room, diane stands in the center like a frightened contestant about to audition a song. she says a prayer under her breath and looks skyward.}
<C>__{diane}

<A>__{tv console static nothing.}
<C>__{diane}

<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{fight about it later, meantime get your ass over here.}
