<A>__{lestat opens his eyes and finds himself high above the desert, the tiny lights of the concert far below. lestat whirls around to suddenly see behind him akasha in an extravagant egyptian robe, its sheer cloth of gold draping her godly form. lestat is awestruck. akasha comes to life...}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{akasha...}
<A>__{akasha still says nothing she advances with a luscious, curling smile.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{why so surprised, my love? you called, and i have come.}
<A>__{lestat is awestruck. there is such an unearthly power in akasha's voice. everything seems to hum and vibrate with her breath.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{never fear me, lestat. your wishes have all come true.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{my wishes...?}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{you have yearned for a companion to share eternity. you have cried out to the world. i have answered your call.}
<A>__{akasha spreads her arms, moving ever closer to lestat.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{you are so bold, like your music. it woke me. you live your life in the open, like i did long ago, when i had a king.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{had a king?}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{he's no more. you are my consort. i've kept you safe alive.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you?}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{you thought it was all you?}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{you have the ego of a king as well. i know you, lestat. i know that you crave to have the world at your feet. i have come to give it to you.}
<A>__{akasha bites her own lip. blood trickles slightly across her chin. lestat stares at the blood, yearns towards it, as the pulse of her blood increases... lestat looks at it, both wanting and fearful. wrapping her arms around lestat, she braces him, licks his face.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{has your tongue lost its taste for blood?}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(melting)}
<D>__{never.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{but you didn't kill the mortal girl.}
<A>__{lestat looks caught.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{instead you kissed her. now kiss me.}
<A>__{(note: shoot as practical, actor against plain night sky, as much as possible.) akasha rises above him, hovers over lestat, letting a single drop of blood spill into his mouth. lestat levitates above the ground to meet her as... akasha hovers higher, drawing him into the sky until their mouths finally meet and her blood flows freely into him. lestat pulls away as a great surge of power gathers in him and floods his body with an electric rush.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{be my king. forget about everything else.}
<A>__{lestat looks straight at akasha, his face flushed. his eyes are empty of everything except her blood.}
<C>__{akasha}
<D>__{what's your answer?}
<A>__{lestat looks at her and then smiles. akasha's mouth spreads into a smile. flashes of brilliant light strobe over them as lestat moves to her, sucks again. there's a powerful rush of wind that engulfs them as they spin together, detached from time and space. flash cuts stock footage all intercut with a: kasha's skin, her body taut and arching. lestat falls back in ecstasy. he shakes out his body and lets out a howl of pleasure feels his arms, his chest, his groin as akasha's blood courses through his veins. akasha watches and waits. finally lestat grins boyishly through bloody teeth and wipes his lips with the back of his hand.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{can we try that again?}
<A>__{akasha smiles at him, then laughs a strange laugh, a kind of purr growl. lestat gazes at her as the sensual hissing seems to surround him. it is seductive and scary. lestat steps up, puts a finger to her lips.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{show me the world...}
<A>__{akasha's mouth spreads into a smile and she yanks him up into the air and off into the night.}
