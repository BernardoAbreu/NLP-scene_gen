<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{a pristine wilderness. the volcanic mountain in the distance. a primitive woman stands on a height, staring in amazement: far off a great dark ship hovers over the plain. a black scarab lands on the back of her neck. bites deep. injecting its cargo of dna into her blood.}
<T>__{flash on:}
<A>__{a microscopic invasion. cells pierced and infused. dna strands twining and mating.}
<B>__{close on the woman}
<A>__{pupils dilating with shock, breath hissing into her lungs. she slaps the back of her neck. looks at her hand. the scarab lies in her palm. as she watches, it crumbles to dust and blows away.}
