<A>__{assassin's partner's pov we see storm hit badly at close range. he takes it in the right center mass. it looks like his right arm is torn off as his .45 is literally blown across the room. felicia is now hysterically screaming but not for long as she is mortally wounded. we are sure storm will collapse and this horror will be over, but storm rushes the remaining assailant, and tilting his body sideways as he enters, he avoids one more ferocious blast. the momentum of storm's quick spin catches the assailant perfectly, and like a fast spinning top slammed against another, storm has the puppet by the strings. he clamps down with his left and only good hand on the assailant's right hand, and uses it against the gun as a tool for more torque. spinning him around until he is at the peak of his circle, storm with all his might spins his whole body in the opposite direction quickly, using the whipping effect of his shoulder and hip to snap the assailant's wrist and flip him violently. there is a loud crack and scream as he lands on his head and neck, and then from the side, point blank another ferocious shotgun blast storm is blown into the air and back onto the bed from which he came.}
