<L>__{interior moving car the family night}
<A>__{everything is hysteria in here. we canâ€™t make out what is being said. the rain lashes at the windshield and steve tries to see out.}
<L>__{exterior street in front of car low angle night}
<A>__{the street cracks wide open and an old wooden coffin is launched upward. it comes crashing down onto the hood of the station wagon. a hideously deformed carcass stares crazily through the rain and wind at steve. screaming wells up inside. steve throws the car into reverse.}
