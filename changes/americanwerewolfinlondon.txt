They both carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in Europe. They are both in their late twenties. It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none too happily. Pushing sheep aside they step out and stretch.}

It is populated by mostly pale young men with longish hair. Several older men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches. Four or five are watching a chess game. Two men are playing darts. The conversation is loud and there is often laughter. But there is something unsavory about these people. A look of leanness and poverty. They seem inbred and somehow sullen. We establish the types and the general level of noise in the room. The door opens revealing David and Jack. There is dead silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the strange attention.
