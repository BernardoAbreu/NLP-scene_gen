<L>__{interior bjurman's apartment dawn}
<A>__{dawn light outside the living room window. bjurman, at his dining table with a glass of orange juice, writing out a check. in the bedroom, salander slips on her leather jacket, shoulders her backpack, hobbles out to the living room.}
<C>__{bjurman}
<D>__{i will drive you home.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{i can get home on my own.}
<C>__{bjurman}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<A>__{it's bizarre: his manner seems to be one of genuine concern. she nods. he hands her the check. then opens the door for her like a perfect gentleman.}
<C>__{bjurman}
<D>__{so, next saturday, here?}
<A>__{she nods. leaves. the door closes.}
