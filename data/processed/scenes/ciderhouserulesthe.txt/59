<A>__{cranked at three quarters, fuzzy sits in bed, wheezing and coughing. he's drawing with great intensity, using crayons on a piece of paper held by a clipboard. homer sits on the end of fuzzy's bed, cleaning up steerforth. homer pauses to look out of the window; he sees wally, dashing and spotless in his uniform beside his flashy car. a life homer might have had crosses his face.}

<C>__{fuzzy}
<D>__{is that soon?}
<A>__{homer looks at fuzzy; his little body is working hard just to breathe.}
<C>__{steerforth}
<D>__{that's a few months away, fuzz.}
<P>__{(to homer)}
<D>__{i still don't feel so good.}
<C>__{fuzzy}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{oh. it's the best time! how come we only get pumpkins once a year?}
<A>__{fuzzy coughs and coughs.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{don't get too excited, fuzzy.}
<C>__{fuzzy}
<D>__{why can't we have pumpkins for christmas, too? we don't get any good presents at christmas, anyway.}
<A>__{homer looks out the window at wally again. his decision forms.}
