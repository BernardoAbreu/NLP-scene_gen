<A>__{the second barrel comes to a stop a good distance from the bar. suddenly, the top is knocked off. trampy sticks her head out. seeing no trouble, she emerges, dizzy as hell, and races for the nearby beer truck.}
<L>__{interior bar moments later}
<A>__{papa and momma beast both charge the bar. the third peanut barrel is released. it sails for them, but they dive out of the way. kabloom! it takes out the rest of the wall. fire and smoke fills the place. adulterer douses momma beast with booze as beer guy nails her with a lit molotov cocktail. whoosh! engulfed in flame, she bolts from the bar shrieking.}

<D>__{one down, one to go!!!}
<A>__{papa enters and is instantly cornered. he swings wildly.}
<C>__{heroine}
<P>__{(to bartender)}
<D>__{help me!}
<A>__{heroine and bartender rip the deer head from the wall and charge papa, pinning him against the wall with the antlers.}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{bozo and beer guy dive into papa's legs, holding them down. tuffy picks up the judge. wham! the shotgun butt knocks out papa's front teeth. tuffy raises the weapon again, staring down at the monster that killed her child, but papa beast gets an arm free to knock away her fatal blow. bartender wrenches papa beast's arm with all his might. with her hair stuck in papa beast's claw, tuffy is pulled face to face with the beast. she squirms as he chomps at her, but with no front teeth, he can't do immediate damage.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{i can't hold him!!!}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{do something!!!}
<A>__{tuffy reaches back and shoves her fist into papa beast's mouth, jamming it down his throat. he instantly gags, sucking for air. papa beast struggles to get free, but the others hold tight. papa beast's body begins to quiver from a lack of oxygen. his eyes widen, face to face with tuffy.}
<C>__{tuffy}
<D>__{choke on it!!!}
<A>__{with one last lunge, papa beast shakes, his life drifting away. his eyes turn black as his body goes limp. tuffy pulls out her arm from his throat.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{god...}
<C>__{bozo}
<D>__{i need to get your number.}
<A>__{tuffy shakes her wet arm dry. as the group pulls away, papa beast is still pinned to the wall with the deer antlers dug into the wood. heroine turns to grandma and grandpa, offering a hand.}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{come on, i will help you.}
<C>__{grandpa}
<D>__{no thank you, we're content.}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{i'm not leaving anyone behind.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{maybe next time, dear.}
<A>__{heroine swallows and nods. honk honk honk! just outside the breached wall, the beer truck pulls up.}
