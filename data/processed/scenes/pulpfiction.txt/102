<L>__{interior apartment day}
<A>__{the bathroom door bursts open and the fourth man charges out, silver magnum raised, firing six booming shots from his hand cannon.}
<C>__{fourth man}
<D>__{die... die... die... die...!}
<A>__{dolly into fourth man, same as before. he scream until he's dry firing. then a look of confusion crosses his face.}
<B>__{two shot jules and vincent}
<A>__{standing next to each other, unharmed. amazing as it seems, none of the fourth man's shots appear to have hit anybody. jules and vincent exchange looks like, "are we hit?" they're as confused at the shooter. after looking at each other, they bring their looks up to the fourth man.}
<C>__{fourth man}
<D>__{i don't understand}
<A>__{the fourth man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's bullets who, unlike his, hit their marks. he drops dead. the two men lower their guns. jules, obviously shaken, sits down in a chair. vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs it off. then heads toward marvin in the corner.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{why the fuck didn't you tell us about that guy in the bathroom? slip your mind? forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{we should be fuckin' dead right now.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{did you see that gun he fired at us? it was bigger than him.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{.357.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{we should be fuckin' dead!}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{yeah, we were lucky.}
<A>__{jules rises, moving toward vincent.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{that shit wasn't luck. that shit was somethin' else.}
<A>__{vincent prepares to leave.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{yeah, maybe.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{that was... divine intervention. you know what divine intervention is?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{yeah, i think so. that means god came down from heaven and stopped the bullets.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{yeah, man, that's what is means. that's exactly what it means! god came down from heaven and stopped the bullets.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i think we should be going now.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{don't do that! don't you fuckin' do that! don't blow this shit off! what just happened was a fuckin' miracle!}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{chill the fuck out, jules, this shit happens.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just happen.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{we should be fuckin' dead now, my friend! we just witnessed a miracle, and i want you to fuckin' acknowledge it!}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now?}
