<D>__{i could be like you i could stay home drinking all day and never do anything responsible.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{i never do anything responsible? what about buying this house that we live in? or the food that we're eating?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{having rich parents doesn't make you responsible. i think it's pretty much done the opposite.}
<A>__{charlie looks stunned.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry that i have a family that supports us and not the other way around.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{what the fuck is that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{nothing, kate. but you can't be mad at me because my family has helped us out. you should be grateful we don't have to struggle.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i wouldn't care if we struggled with money. i've struggled with money my whole life.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'd rather worry about where my next meal is coming from than if i in some drunken stupor married a man who just wants to party and meet bands.}
<C>__{charlie}

<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm talking about you being a baby. a selfish baby.}

<A>__{kate doesn't answer.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i'm trying, kate. i'm trying to understand you. but it's hard. you're different and maybe it's good that you're different. maybe i'm bad and bad for you or something because i didn't think the person you were before was so awful. i loved that person. yeah, she drank a lot and she did some silly things...but she was my kate.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you loved that person? do you not love me now?}
