<A>__{his p.o.v. optimus prime his head is turned so all assembled can see. his eyes flicker weakly, his voice rumbles with overtone of vast weariness and resignation}

<D>__{until that day...}
<A>__{until all are one... continue the struggle... (sags, gasps, hanging on) transfer the matrix of leadership.}
<B>__{tighten shot on ultra magnus and optimus prime}
<A>__{a distraught ultra magnus nods, reaches out with free hand and points his forefinger at optimus prime's chest. then, pressing a button on prime's chest, a small, secret doorway opens, and we see something extremely bright glowing in there. ultra magnus, nearly blinded by the intense light, reaches in, and lifts out the autobot leadership matrix, and holds it for a moment in his hand.}
<B>__{angle on all}
<A>__{the bright light, which emanates from the perfect crystal, seems to blind everybody and washes all color out of the shot. then, slowly, ultra magnus moves it into his own chest, closes the door, and the light is gone, save for a momentary, and extremely powerful glow from his eyes. on kup, hot rod, arcee and perceptor they are all full of great sorrow. on prime he dies all of his lights go out, including his eyes.}
