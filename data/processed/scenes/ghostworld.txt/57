<A>__{enid walks in behind seymour.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i'm not sure i have anything to drink... there might be some }
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{it doesn't matter, i'm not staying long... i just want to make sure i convince you not to give up yet.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{"yet."}
<L>__{interior seymour's bedroom night}
<A>__{they both have drinks now. he puts on a jazz record, an instrumental.}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(picks up an antique knick knack)}
<D>__{wow, this is so cool...}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{if you don't mind my asking why do you care so much if i get a date or not?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i dunno... because i can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...}
<A>__{enid finds a painting leaning in a pile of stuff against the wall in the corner. it's an old fashioned cartoony stereotype of a black man's head, with big lips and a huge toothy smile.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what the fuck, seymour?! what is this?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{what?... oh that... i borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... i guess it's mine now.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what, are you a klansman or something?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{yeah, right, i'm a klansman thanks a lot!... do you know the cook's chicken franchise?}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(quoting tv commercial in deep voice)}
<D>__{"four piece cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's out ray geous"!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{yeah, well "cook's" is just a made up name. when they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "the coon chicken inn" that's an early painting of their first logo.}
<A>__{he takes out a scrapbook.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i'm obsessed with all this stuff this lost culture of the 20th century.}
<A>__{she looks through the scrapbook we see the coon chicken logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man, then into an older distinguished black chef with the logo "cook's chicken inn." then to a white version of the same chef, followed by a female white chef, then to a streamlined 90's version. on another page is a collection of cosmetic labels tracing the design evolution of a different company.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{why doesn't everybody know this?}
<A>__{the record ends. seymour gets up to take it off the turntable.}
<C>__{seymour}
<P>__{(somewhat bitterly)}
<D>__{it's ancient history. the same reason nobody knows about this lionel belasco record.}
<A>__{he puts on another record.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{actually, i was a whole lot more interested in the cook's phenomenon when i was about your age. i've kind of lost interest since i've been working for them...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{you work at cook's chicken?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{for nineteen years...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what are you, a fry cook or something?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{nothing so glamorous... actually, i'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{jesus, i'd go nuts if i had to work in an office all day.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{hey, i get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{yeah, but still...}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do i want?}
<A>__{enid puts down the scrapbook, stares at the painting.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{so, i don't really get it are you saying that things were better back then}
<P>__{(points at painting)}
<D>__{even though there was stuff like this?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{no, in a lot of ways things are better now... i dunno... it's complicated. everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{hey, can i borrow this?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{what? why?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i promise i will take good care of it.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. maybe it would be better if you }
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{don't you trust me, seymour?}
