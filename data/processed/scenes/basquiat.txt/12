<A>__{bending over a countertop, we see gina cardinale, 22. he fixates on her. she looks up and notices his stare. she continues to work. still staring at her, he sits down at a table. he pours maple syrup onto the table. he draws in the syrup with his fingers.}
<B>__{close on syrup on table}
<A>__{another waitress arrives at his table. she's put off by the syrup.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{what'll it be?}
<A>__{jean thinks about it, eyes still following gina.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{ummm. it'll be great. we'll live together in peace. what's her name?}
<P>__{(indicates gina)}
<A>__{he looks up at the waitress.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{gina. what'll it be?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{pancakes.}
<A>__{she leaves and whispers something to gina. gina turns and glances over at jean. jean pours more syrup and starts writing his name. at the grill, leshko, the burly owner cook, has his watchful eye on jean. he doesn't like what he sees. jean smears the syrup thinly, so it doesn't erase itself. he draws a picture of gina, using his fingers and the silverware, rendering her last expression strikingly with a few quick lines. a gaunt young man saunters up to jean's table. he's sort of a tall puerto rican alain delon with sleepy eyes. he is benny.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{hey willie mays.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{willie mays.}
<A>__{suddenly, rene ricard enters a one man parade. he beckons to gina, snapping his fingers.}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{nurse!!! oh!!! nurse!!! carrot juice. tofu burger. rapido!}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{we don't serve that amigo.}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{fine... a greasy cheeseburger. fries and a vodka.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{the devil, man. rene ricard. art critic writes for artforum. people read him. tell him who you are..}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{who am i?}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{samo.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{oh yeah..}
<A>__{rene lands at the counter. jean's gaze is still on gina. she waits on a man at a nearby table.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{how's the special today?}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{it's your stomach.}
<A>__{she hurries past jean.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{she slows down, not wanting to.}
<C>__{basquiat }
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{she looks at her portrait in the syrup... she can't resist smiling.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{it's me. i've never been done in maple syrup. here's a rag.}
<A>__{gina smiles. she offers him one. as she holds it out, their eyes lock. she tries to resist his smile.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{gina?}
<A>__{she puts her finger in the syrup and licks it off. benny takes it all in. leshko is upon them.}
<C>__{leshko}
<D>__{alright. look at you, staring at this girl, making a mess.}
<A>__{he waves jean toward the door. jean takes gina's rag and begins cleaning his mess, seemingly compliant.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{how about those pancakes?}
<A>__{he brings out a roll of dimes to the tabletop and splits it open. dimes roll all over the table and stick in the syrupy parts. the manager explodes.}
<C>__{leshko}
<D>__{ok! goodbye!}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{pipe down, lech. let him order.}
<C>__{leshko}
<D>__{you nuts? let him order? you on his side? you're not such a good waitress. you get out, too.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{i just don't think you're being fair.}
<C>__{leshko}
<D>__{i need this?}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{i need this?}
<A>__{gina quietly removes her apron in disbelief. benny gets up to leave very casually.}
<C>__{benny}
<P>__{(waving g'bye to jean)}
<D>__{willie mays.}
<C>__{leshko}
<P>__{(to gina)}
<D>__{that's right. you go with them. make babies the government has to pay for.}
