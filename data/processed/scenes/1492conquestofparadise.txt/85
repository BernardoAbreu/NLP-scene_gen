<L>__{exterior river day}
<A>__{standing in the stream up to his thighs, a spaniard (a gold expert) examines some stones. he then looks up at columbus and pinzon and just throws the stones back into the water without a word. the group of spaniards are resting, exhausted by the humidity. some are drinking from the river, others soak bandanas, and tie them around their necks... one after another, they stand up slowly they look discouraged, tired, and beaten.}
