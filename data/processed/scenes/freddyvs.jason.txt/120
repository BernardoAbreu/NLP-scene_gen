<L>__{interior main cabin continuous action}
<A>__{meagan and stormie run into the main room. stormie spots a phone and goes to it, dialing frantically.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{who are you calling?!}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{the cops! who else?!}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{are you kidding?! they'll lock us up and throw away the key!}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{fine by me!}
<P>__{(clicks the receiver)}
<D>__{damnit! it's dead!}
<A>__{just then, erwin bursts into the cabin, slamming the door shut behind him.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{he's right behind me!}
<A>__{stormie and meagan look out the window sure enough, jason is storming towards them, holding the chainsaw.}
<C>__{stormie}
<P>__{(to erwin)}
<D>__{you're the one who brought him back to life!}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{and?!}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{well, do something!}
<A>__{erwin screams and runs for the closet, hiding inside. stormie clucks:}
<C>__{stormie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{oh, some hero!}
<A>__{just then, the chainsaw rips through the front door. meagan and stormie scream and follow erwin into the closet, closing themselves inside. they cower in the closet, listening... for a long moment... nothing but the sound of their heavy breathing. then, with the ripping of wood, jason chainsaws the closet door knocking it to the floor. erwin draws out his pin and starts stabbing himself in the finger. jason charges forward, when meagan suddenly stands up in front of him and yells:}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{to everyone's shock... jason does.}
<C>__{meagan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now... just stop! we're the ones that brought you back to life. and you have no right to kill us with that chainsaw! in fact... you owe us...}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{that's right! she gave you her boyfriend's heart, you know!}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{jason cocks his massive head like a perplexed pup.}
<C>__{meagan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{look! here's his picture...}
<A>__{meagan takes off the necklace that jesse gave her and opens the locket. she shows jason the photo of jesse inside. jason drops the chainsaw and takes the locket in his humongous hands, gently touching the photo of jesse with a meaty finger.}
<C>__{meagan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now, i know that you've been through a lot. and i know that you're pissed off about being murdered and all.}
<C>__{stormie}
<P>__{(interjects)}
<D>__{i know i would be!}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{but if you help us kill freddy krueger... i promise to help you find the little bastard that killed you. what do you say? have we got a deal?}
<A>__{meagan sticks out her hand to shake. jason stares at it, looks back at the locket, then to meagan. finally, he reaches out his huge hand for meagan's when... brilliant, blinding white light blazes through the windows, freezing everyone to the spot. anxious to get out of the closet with jason, erwin crawls across the floor and peeks out over the window sill. angle out window a dozen police cars shine their lights towards the cabin, two dozen cops aim their weapons. in the middle of this impressive show of force is murdoch. he raises a bullhorn to his lips.}
<C>__{murdoch}
<P>__{(through bullhorn)}
<D>__{you in there! this is captain renton murdoch state trooper! i am ordering you to come out with your hands up! i will give you until the count of three...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{three!}
<A>__{meagan turns to jason, shoving him back into the closet.}
<C>__{meagan}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{jason, you have to hide! stay in here and don't come out until we tell you. stormie... help me!}
<A>__{stormie helps meagan stuff jason into the closet, closing the door. then they quickly smooth down their hair and clothes, moving towards the door.}
