<L>__{interior beauty parlor day}
<A>__{cindy, the manicurist, does mrs. pressman's nails. maggie sits on the floor next to peggy's salon chair, fixing the base of a barber chair. she tightens a screw and looks up, satisfied. cindy's dog is on the floor near maggie.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{cindy, you better 86 sprout. he seems to be enjoying the petroleum distillates. cindy rolls over in her chair, picks up her dog and rolls back to her station.}
<C>__{cindy}
<A>__{that's it. back to obedience school.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(to peggy)}
<A>__{okay have a seat... gently, carefully. peggy sits in the chair. maggie spins her around and around.}
<C>__{peggy}
<P>__{(delighted as she spins)}
<A>__{you're a goddess!}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{stop it. when you talk like that, i get turned on and it frightens me. just then. ike enters the salon, taking off his sunglasses. peggy hops off the chair.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{hello. i'm looking for maggie carpenter. there was a sign at the hardware store across the street...}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{are you a reporter? it's a little early in the game for ike to be thrown off guard.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<A>__{what?}
<C>__{peggy}
<P>__{(eyeing his loafers)}
<A>__{it's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview maggie.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{about her upcoming wedding and all.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{no, about her getting that asshole from new york fired. ike smiles down at his loafers and shrugs.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i am just such a reporter. and you are?}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{peggy phleming. not the ice skater. peggy steps aside. ike moves toward cindy and mrs. pressman.}

<P>__{(yelling to peggy)}
<A>__{reporter?}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{yup! ike crouches to see maggie on the floor just as she rises to her feet. ike straightens up. for a moment, he is thrown by her beauty and intelligent eyes.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i hope you have a different angle. it's pretty much all been covered.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{originality is my speciality.}
<C>__{maggie}

<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{hold on nobody interviews maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.}

<A>__{yes, mrs. pressman.}
<C>__{mrs. pressman}
<A>__{it's her fourth time to the altar, you know. not seven like they said.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i know. tell me something. do you think she's going to make it all the way this time? during the ike mrs. pressman exchange, maggie looks at ike. there's something familiar about him. she looks over at peggy and beckons her to a copy of ike's column affixed to a mirror. a goatee and horns, have been scrawled on ike's byline picture. he's been "devilized". peggy coughs as she recognizes ike in the newspaper clipping.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{she swallowed her gun. mrs. pressman continues her story to ike.}
<C>__{mrs. pressman}
<A>__{i'm not sure. mr. schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't. he says she's so famous now, maybe vegas will give odds on her. i'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{good fact. well, you let me know.}
<C>__{mrs. pressman}
<A>__{oh, i will.}
