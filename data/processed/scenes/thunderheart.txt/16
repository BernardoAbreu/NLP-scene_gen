<T>__{pov:}
<A>__{way out in the bizarre moonscape of eroded rock and earth, a lone figure on a motorcycle bounces and grinds, born out of a silvery heat mirage. it's fifty yards off but heading straight for us. the heartbeat drum. reverse ray and cooch try to make the figure out.}
<B>__{in the badlands}
<A>__{the archaic mud caked harley chugs and stalls, spits and choices, and begins an incredible drive straight up the steep side of this natural wonder. at the throttle is an imposing figure. walter crow horse is a portly indian in his late thirties with a black reservation hat worn low over a face that seems to have been cast from a bust of sitting bull. sitting bull with aviator shades. denim jacket over checkered shirt. faded jeans. well broken duct taped boots. his hair is worn long in tight duel braids. the rusted bike bajas up and down slopes, finally stalling out, twenty feet or so from the murder site. crow horse swings his bulk off the bike like dismounting a horse. he looks around suspiciously then pulls a rolled up blanket from the carrier rack.}
<B>__{leo little sky}
<A>__{lies in death. crow horse's boots move in stealthily, creaking like saddle leather. he squats and looks at the corpse... then looks around with animal alertness. he reaches into the front pocket of his jacket and pulls out some bull durham tobacco. he pinches some and offers it to the four directions around the body. he then unrolls the blanket, begins to move the dead man... sense something and wheels to see cooch standing behind him, one hand behind his back where his gun must be, and the other hand holding up open wallet. the sun hits his badge.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{crow horse hawks his eyes onto a big rock, a full second before ray steps out, his .45 drawn but held at ease. crow horse slowly raises his arms as ray moves up to him, studying him.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{taking ol' leo somewhere?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{leo's been out here too long, man. i'm taking him to ceremonial burial.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{this is a restricted area.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{check him out, ray.}
<A>__{ray frisks the indian, finds an old leather wallet, and then a gun. a .38.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{nice piece. you come back here to cover your tracks, geronimo? what's your name?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{it ain't geronimo.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{i think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? this is the bear creek indian reservation.}
<A>__{cooch walks around to the front of crow horse, and studies him.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{i know where i am. i'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. it's your call. who are you?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{i'm a full blood oglala sioux, born and raised on this reservation.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{you're a wise ass. ray check his wallet.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{who the fuck is he?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{ a fucking cop.}
<A>__{a pause. a long, dead of south dakota, badlands pause. cooch turns and looks at ray who holds up the open wallet, revealing a badge. like cooch's it shines in the sun.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{walter crow horse. tribal police.}
<A>__{cooch stands staring at the indian... then takes a few steps over to ray and grabs the wallet. he examines it. then looks at crow horse and laughs.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{he's a fucking cop.}
<A>__{the indian cop has plenty of time to get up on his own but he kneels there, tauntingly, waiting for ray to help him. ray walks over and offers a hand. crow horse takes it, and pulls himself up, looking square into ray's sunglasses. cooch walks over and hands the officer his wallet, and his .23. crow horse takes the items, eyeing the older agent.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{we got the wire ya was comin'. you're the indian official, yeah?}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{no. no, that's ray, here. ray, uh...}
<P>__{(searching his imagination)}
<D>__{ray... little weasel.}
<A>__{ray does a take but quickly recovers, meeting crow horse's scrutinizing gaze. crow horse nods to ray, and ray nods back in case it's the indian thing to do. crow horse nods again. ray nods again.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{leo's gotta get to burial, brother. he's gotta make the journey.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{what journey?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{tell him, ray.}
<A>__{ray stares at crow horse, uneasy. the wind sings through the badlands.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{leo has to take the journey, cooch.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{we'll have to give leo a refund. because he's gotta go to the m.e. in case you don't know, officer, violation of the major crimes act on }
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{ an indian reservation is within the jurisdiction of the federal bureau of intimidation. i know that.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{good. thank you.}
<A>__{crow horse says something in sioux to ray. ray just stares.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{i said when can leo be taken to ceremony?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{after we've completed our investigation.}
<A>__{crow horse is staring at ray.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{that's a nice suit.}
<A>__{ray looks offended. cooch puts a hand on crow horse's shoulder and walks him toward his beat up motorcycle.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, officer crow foot.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{you ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to washinton, are ya? they done that to one of our girls once. leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.}
<A>__{crow horse turns and looks at ray. ray is quick this time.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{leo's gonna need his hands, cooch. he does quillwork.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{i think leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{respect the dead, hoss. because when }
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{ did you understand me when i said that }
<C>__{crow horse}
<P>__{(walking away)}
<D>__{ violation of the major crimes act on an indian reservation is within the jurisdiction of the federal bureau of instigation. i know that.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{crow horse appears to be getting on his bike when suddenly he moves like a cat and lays his knife to the dead man's head. he cuts away a patch of hair.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{what the hell you doing?!}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{his mother needs a piece of his hair. it's for the keeping of the souls ceremony.}
<P>__{(wrapping lock of hair)}
<D>__{has to be kept for four days.}
<A>__{cooch and ray stand there, watching crow horse mount his bike and push off down a nasty slope back through the badlands. he starts his motor. it dies. then starts again.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{keeping of the souls. do they still burn their dead or something?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{beats the hell outta me.}
<A>__{ray and cooch look off across the badlands, as far out of their element as they can be. close on the white eagle plume in the circle in the sand, fluttering in the wind. the gold spit shined le baron eases to a crawl, passing an old wooden sign. "leaving bear creak indian reservation." and immediately pulling in front of a squat old bar with a burned out neon miller light. dwight yoakum croons "youuuuuu got your little ways" on the jukebox from inside. the buffalo butte bar has several cracked and sun bleached buffalo skulls hanging off the edge of its flat roof and big faded white letters painted across the front read: "no indians allowed." (this sign actually exists today in the res line border town of scenic, south dakota). the car pulls up beside a pick up and parks. ray and cooch step out, careful to walk wide around a pitbull in the bed of the truck. a white local walks out of the bar and looks askance at the suits. as the two feds approach the bar, cooch looks up at the warning sign. ray sees it too.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{sorry, ray. you're gonna have to wait in the car. i will bring you out a cheeseburger.}
<A>__{the young agent smiles, amused, starts to enter the bar but }
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{ray spins quickly, paranoid about entering. but the man calling to them is an indian himself. tribal president oliver clear moon, a small man in his late fifties who peers out at the agents through fat bifocals. he wears a straw cowboy hat, red windbreaker and his hair is cut short, or "bobtailed" as the indians say. clear moon is walking away from a parked pick up truck, toward the white men, eyeing the two with deep curiosity.}
<C>__{clear moon}
<P>__{(heavy indian accent)}
<D>__{you made it. was te.}
<A>__{cooch discreetly peeks into a folder as he walks toward the man}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{you must be... president clear bone.}
<C>__{clear moon}
<D>__{clear moon.}
<P>__{(pointing to the sky)}
<D>__{moon. you must be the sioux.}
<A>__{he is pointing his long, skinny finger at cooch.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{no. that's ray here. ray...}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{ray levoi, sir. pleasure.}
<A>__{clear moon beholds the young agent with hopeful eyes, a smile breaking across his flaccid brown skin. he takes ray's hand in a respectful double clutch and grips him tightly... almost desperately.}
<C>__{clear moon}
<D>__{it's about time they sent us one of our own. was te.}
<A>__{he keeps pumping ray's hand, looking into his face with great admiration. cooch looks on with amusement.}
<C>__{clear moon}
<D>__{things are no good here. it is like war zone. we need an official who understands what is good for the indian people. who knows indian way.}
<A>__{clear moon has not released ray's arm as he leads them to a string of seedy motel units across the street.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i thought we were staying on the reservation.}
<C>__{clear moon}
<D>__{yes. rooms thirteen and fourteen are on indian land.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{clear moon}
<D>__{are you hungry? i have some nice raw kidney in the truck.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{oh, i'm set, sir. i'm set.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{he's starving, mr. clear moon. get him some raw kidney. he hasn't had any indian food in days...}
<A>__{and clear moon guides them through the front door of room}
