<A>__{with a loud squeal, a sand worm bursts out of the sand in front of aline. at the end of its elongated body, a pair of snapping jaws fold out, lined with razor sharp teeth. aline scrambles back and falls down. her rifle is out of reach. another sand worm bursts out of the sand, diving for carnby. but he is quick on the draw. he shoots the sand worm before it can bite him. the bullets blow apart the sand worm's head. the sand on the chamber floor comes alive with movement as sand worms burrow towards them. agents barr and cheung open fire on the sand worms. aline fumbles for her flashlight, shining it at the sand worm. it recoils from the light and hisses at her. the sand worm's jaws fold open, revealing its razor sharp teeth. the sand worm tries to dodge the light. it snaps at aline with its jaws and lunges at her. she grabs it by the torso, just under the snapping jaws. the sand worm struggles, trying to bite aline. she can barely hold it away from her. her grip starts to loosen. the sand worm's snapping jaws are almost at aline's face. she strains to hold it away. with the sound of a gunshot, the sand worm's head explodes. it flops to one side, dead. carnby stands behind it, his gun smoking from the shot. a sand worm bursts out and chomps down on cheung's bad foot. she screams. barr shoots the worm that bit cheung. cheung falls back, her body seizing up from its poisonous bite. cheung's body contorts. barr grabs her as cheung's head reels back and her body goes limp. she's dead. burke turns, his face grim. he opens fire on the sand worms. with precision and intensity, he fires controlled bursts at any movement under the sand. carnby fires along with him. after a few seconds, the movement has stopped. aline, carnby, burke, and barr stand together. they look down at cheung's body. over the comm link, burke can hear the sounds of the battle going on up above them.}
