<L>__{interior office waiting room day}
<A>__{jill thumbs through a life magazine with eldridge cleaver on the cover, waiting for an interview in the outer office of the 9000 building whose open window overlooks a smoggy chunk of the city. she's one of so many girls that at first she's not recognizable. all of them have composites which they carry in leather folders. they eye each other uneasily.}
<L>__{interior interview office day}
<A>__{there is the producer, barry, and the director, johnny pope.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{egypt?}
<C>__{pope}

<A>__{jill nods.}
<C>__{jill}

<D>__{this town...}
<A>__{at the shop on brighton way in beverly hills. a few bars of simon and garfunkel's "sounds of silence" covers george pulling up on his bike. the street is empty of traffic except there are scores and scores of parked cars, a few parking lot attendants, and some meter maids. george starts toward the shop. a pair of women in colored smocks and huge curlers burst out of the shop. they look like medusas. they hurtle down the sidewalk as if they're running from something. then they find their respective cars and begin pouring pennies into the meters. clink, buzz, clink, buzz. george looks glum. he's walking along the street. a girl stops him. she's driving by in a 3.4 jag.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{hi, george.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{hey, baby, what's happening?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{nothing, i reconciled with ron, you know, the guy i divorced last summer.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{great, great. i hope you make it.}
<A>__{somebody honks in back of her.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{call me!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't have your number, stop by the shop.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(waving goodbye)}
<D>__{okay!}
<A>__{george looks after her, smiling. then:}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{god damn it.}
<A>__{he goes into the shop. a large gilt mirror on one wall of the shop. it covers most of the wall it leans against. an attractive young woman in her early thirties, everything matching, a real french garden, leans forward into shot and looks at herself in the mirror. she studies her image carefully. she moves closer to it. she seems uncertain at first. then as she looks her conviction grows:}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{great... great... great... great... great!}
<A>__{she turns back to dennis lolly, her hairdresser. she takes his hand.}
<C>__{tina }
<D>__{great, dennis.}
<A>__{with her other hand she touches her hair.}
<C>__{tina }
<D>__{do you think there's enough height? i mean do you think there's enough height?}
<A>__{now she and dennis look into the mirror at her together. dennis toys with the calico scarf around his neck. felicia, in far corner, waits defiantly. george spots her.}
<C>__{tina }
<D>__{george, do you think there's enough height?}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(on way to felicia)}
<D>__{yeah, sure.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{dennis doesn't think so.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{man, i didn't say a word.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{well, what do you think? is there enough height?}
<A>__{both dennis and tina turn back to the mirror for further deliberation.}
<C>__{felicia}
<D>__{you're late, george.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(taking her to his cubicle)}
<D>__{i gotta talk to you.}
<C>__{felicia}
<D>__{i don't want to talk about it...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{but you don't know what happened.}
<C>__{felicia}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{george, do you think there's too much height?}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(seating her)}
<D>__{it's great. you don't know what happened, this girl she almost got }
<C>__{felicia}
<P>__{(a little hysterical)}
<D>__{i don't care about that girl, i don't care if she's dead.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{calm down, baby.}
<C>__{felicia}
<P>__{(calming down)}
<D>__{i'm perfectly calm, george, i'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average hollywood... mummers...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ what?}
<C>__{felicia}
<D>__{nummers.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{felicia}
<D>__{ numbers, and i don't need to place myself in that kind of position.}
<A>__{gloria tugs on george's arm.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what're you here for?}
<C>__{gloria}
<P>__{(as if giving away a secret)}
<D>__{ a wash and set.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you need a cut.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{but mr. norman said }

<C>__{gloria}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{i just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, baby, i'm george and it needs to be cut.}
<P>__{(to felicia)}
<D>__{but i don't want to place you in that position either.}
<C>__{felicia}
<D>__{ i like myself far too much, far too much.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't want to place you in any position }
<C>__{felicia}
<D>__{ to be put in that kind of position...}
