<L>__{interior sam tannick's office day}
<A>__{gibbons stands before sam's desk. sam scans over the communique.}
<C>__{sam tannick}
<D>__{ridiculous. cut him off. i'm sorry gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{i think we should send him whatever he wants.}
<C>__{sam tannick}
<D>__{you what? a wire transfer of this size?}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{if it means getting silent night back, absolutely.}
<C>__{sam tannick}
<D>__{you're talking about a very expensive risk here.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{he's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. he got us an account number to boot. now even if he's just dumb and lucky, i say we back his play.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i put him out there, sam. if he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. i can't let that happen.}
<C>__{sam tannick}
<D>__{why not? you were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?}
<A>__{gibbons smiles.}
<C>__{sam tannick}
<D>__{alright, do what you want. but keep the screws on him. he's a wild card. that could be either good or bad.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{so the odds are up to fifty fifty? i can deal with that.}
