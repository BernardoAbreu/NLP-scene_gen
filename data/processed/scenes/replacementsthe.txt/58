<L>__{interior locker room day}
<A>__{it's very quiet. shane sits in pads and no jersey, methodically squeezing a football. reese evans, his center, stops by.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{shane nods and gives a nauseous looking smile.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{remember to nod your head on the snap.}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(out of it)}
<D>__{nod my head?}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{for when murray's in. the deaf kid. hello? he needs to look at you on the snap.}
<A>__{shane nods that he understands but he goes back to staring at a wall. andre and jamal sit facing each other. andre throws a vicious forearm at jamal's head but jamal catches it. they both nod in approval. lou pacifico smokes and stares. bateman is leaning against a wall, fully dressed, helmet on. he's staring into space and smiling to himself. he looks terrifying. earl wilkinson (the criminal) is polishing a beautiful pair of new alligator shoes. clifford franklin looks at himself in the mirror as he ceremoniously puts on his helmet. walter cochran is reading his bible in front of his locker, which features a picture of jesus and a cross. mickey lee (ex sumo) is sitting in front of a bowl of hard boiled eggs. he's methodically popping them into his mouth. he eats four as we watch. coach pilachowski comes up to lee and watches him eat.}
<C>__{pilachowski}
<D>__{what are you, crazy? nobody eats right before a game.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i always ate before a big match. i need the bulk.}
<A>__{like a hole in the head he needs the bulk. coach mcginty comes strolling through the locker room, the picture of calm. he walks by defensive end tight end brian murray and signs to him to have a good game. murray signs back, "thanks, coach." cochran spots mcginty and puts down his bible.}
<C>__{cochran}
<D>__{coach mcginty, i'd like to lead the team in the pregame prayer. mcginty no. no praying. that's the problem with professional sports today: too much god damn praying. five hundred dollar fine to the first man i hear praying.}
<A>__{mcginty turns and bums an egg from mickey and walks to the middle of the locker room. he eats the egg as he turns slowly and takes in his players.}
<D>__{mcginty a lot of people are waiting for you to fall on your asses today. and guess what? you're going to. but i don't give a shit if you look funny out there. or if you miss a block, or drop a pass, or trip over your own dick. this is professional. and the difference between professional and amateur, between playing for the washington redskins and michigan state is simply... money. you are being paid to win. not just to play. not just to learn how to be good sports. not for the alumni. you are being paid to win. i don't care how the fuck you do it. but i'm demanding it. because those guys whose place you're taking have forgotten that simple fact. so, go win it.}
<A>__{he walks away. the players get up and start moving.}
