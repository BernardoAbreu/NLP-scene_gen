<A>__{darkness and silence. where the hell is everyone? he quicks it to the den, cartoons on t.v. but no one watching. with escalat ing concern he hits the kitchen and now he's shouting upstairs. "margie. margie." about to climb when bobby appears at the top.}

<A>__{berlin has already grabbed a telephone. aware it's dead before bobby tells him "they're all out around here." he wanders down stairs in apparent oblivion to berlin's distress. berlin races back to the den and new problems. desperate to get at the guns but all cabinets locked "where's the keys, bobby? i need a gun."}
