<L>__{interior corridor moments later}
<A>__{the three slowly edge towards a room at the end of a creepy hallway. an orange glow flickers from the far room. the unmistakable sounds of a furnace make it all the more eerie. as they near the door, they're able to see inside the room; the shadow of a figure looms against a steel oven. they edge closer. they peek inside the }
<L>__{interior crematorium}
<A>__{oddly there is no one there. as they enter, passing the furnace, a momentary whoosh of flames startles them all! they jump back bumping right into: mr. bludworth, the dark, sinister mortician from fd1, who has inexplicably appear behind them.}
<C>__{mortician}
<D>__{hello, clear. i've been keeping an eye out for you.}
<A>__{the mortician rolls a metal gurney carrying evan's eyeless body toward the firing oven. kimberly and thomas are scared.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{oh my god. that's evan shaeffer.}
<A>__{clear, however, seems to expect nothing less.}
<C>__{mortician}
<D>__{come to... pick my brain?}
<A>__{the mortician slides a gleaming set of medical pliers into evan's mouth. and yanks out a gold tooth. kimberly recoils as he discards the bloody tooth on a metal tray.}
<C>__{mortician}
<P>__{(to kimberly)}
<D>__{flesh and bone require 1,600 degrees for cremation. gold, prosthetics and other metals must be removed before the final }
<C>__{clear}
<P>__{(not falling for this again)}
<D>__{just a simple question and we'll leave you alone with your new friend.}
<A>__{the mortician grins; he likes the new clear. he crosses the room and hits a lever. ka chunk! the oven begins to blaze.}
<C>__{mortician}
<D>__{fire away.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{how do you cheat death once and for all?}
<A>__{the mortician, recrossing the room, passes kimberly and stoops down to sniff, no inhale, a terrified kimberly's essence.}
<C>__{mortician}
<D>__{dead. but still fresh.}
<A>__{kimberly shudders as the mortician moves back to evan's body. clear has had about enough.}
<C>__{clear}
<P>__{(to the mortician)}
<D>__{look, we drove a long way to get here. so if you happen to know how to get this death monkey off our backs, it sure would be swell if you told us.}
<A>__{the mortician now clamps the pliers around evan's nipple ring.}
<C>__{mortician}
<D>__{for what purpose? you seek a back way out of a room with but one door. you can't cheat death; there are no escapes.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{bullshit. you told me death has a distinct design, a blueprint, unalterable. but alex and i cheated death not once, but dozens of times. if the design is flawed, it can be beaten.}
<A>__{a sick smile crosses the mortician's lips. he yanks the nipple ring off! kimberly looks on both horrified and awed when clear doesn't flinch back from the pliers, where a bloody nub dangles.}
<C>__{mortician}
<D>__{such fire in you now. people are always most alive just before they die. don't you think?}
<A>__{clear steps back from him, hate flashing in her eyes.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{it can be beaten. and you know it.}
<A>__{creeeaaak slam! the mortician rolls evan's body into the oven.}
<C>__{mortician}
<D>__{some say that there is a balance to everything. an equilibrium that is the connective tissue of the universe. they say that for every lif e there is a death, and for every death a life...}
<A>__{his words hang in the air. an ominous breeze enters.}
<C>__{mortician}
<D>__{solus novus anima licet evinco mortis; only new life can defeat death.}
<P>__{(off their confusion)}
<D>__{the list of life is forever set by the divine plan, the guiding hand that plots the course of the universe, down to its tiniest element s.}
<A>__{thomas looks to clear; what's he talking about? the mortician focuses on kimberly as if the others had ceased to exist.}
<C>__{mortician}
<D>__{the list accounts for every life; from the dawn of man to the great apocalypse. but the introduction of life that was not meant to be, a soul forbidden to roam the earth, that could invalidate death's list, shatter its very existence.}
<A>__{evan's other eye pops , startling thomas and kimberly.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{what the hell does that mean?}
<C>__{mortician}
<P>__{(with finality)}
<D>__{to figure that out you'll have to follow the sign s.}
<A>__{the mortician grabs kimberly.}
<C>__{mortician}
<D>__{but be warned. to disrupt the grand design is to unravel the tapestry of the universe. when you pull all the threads apart, you may find yourself hanging from them.}
<A>__{the mortician finally lets kimberly go.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{one last question. why is death working backwards this time?}
<A>__{the mortician glances at his watch evan's bran d new rolex.}
<C>__{mortician}
<P>__{(shakes head; a sick smile)}
<D>__{sorry, time's up.}
