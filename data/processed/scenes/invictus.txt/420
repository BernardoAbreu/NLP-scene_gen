<D>__{who's the fittest team on this field?}
<A>__{the answer lies in their eyes: they are. an all black penalty goal makes it 12 9 almost immediately. a springbok penalty goal answers. 12 12. seven minutes from the end of extra time, the springboks earn a scrum deep in all blacks territory.}

<D>__{keep it here. run it forward.}
<A>__{the scrum goes down, wheels a little.}
<C>__{springbok fly half}
<D>__{francois!}
<A>__{pienaar turns his head. the fly half taps his own chest: give me the ball. pienaar hesitates, then nods to the scrum half: give him the ball. the ball goes into the scrum. the ball works its way back through the feet of the eight springbok forwards. the scrum half gathers it, spins it out to the fly half who takes one step to his left and kicks a drop goal high into the air. ball soaring past a backdrop of open mouths. higher than the uprights ... ... but through them nonetheless. springboks 15 12 all blacks. an entire nation jumps to its feet.}
