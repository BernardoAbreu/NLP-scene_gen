<L>__{interior charles' room day}
<A>__{charles threads the film into the projector.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{that night of the crash, you started getting all weird.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ what?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{like mr. attitude all of a sudden.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{your movie was over! that's what you said! you were upset. i gave you a camera! i helped you!}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{don't pretend like you did it for me! you didn't do it for me and you know it!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what's your problem?}
<A>__{charles rolls the film, dims the lights }
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{it was never about me! it was always about alice!}
<A>__{and suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet, there she is: alice, from the night of the train crash. the scene plays as they filmed it:}
<C>__{mrs. hathaway}
<D>__{john. i don't like it. this case. these murders.}
<C>__{detective hathaway}
<D>__{what am i supposed to do, go to michigan with you?}
<A>__{the filmed scene continues as joe and charles argue:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, you're the one who wanted the wife in the movie!}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{not so you could fall in love with her!}
<A>__{joe's mind spins how does he respond to this?!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what do you even care what i think about alice?!}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{because i like her! that's why! that's why i asked her in the first place! so i could get to know her, not you!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ wait, you like alice dainard?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{you're such an idiot.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(from charles' movie)}
<D>__{guys, look out!}
<A>__{they watch for a moment as the train crash happens but it's so sudden, so fast, the camera picks up almost nothing. within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the settling debris. charles moves forward, so the film is now partially being projected on him.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{shit! look at all that smoke! we can't use any of this. and you won't even let me blow up your train. everything's bogus.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{we can make another train and blow that one up.}
<A>__{joe moves forward. part of the film projected on him, too.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{i do like her. sorry about that.}
<C>__{cjar}
<D>__{shut up. it's okay.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that's not even what bothers me.}
<P>__{(beat, finally, sad)}
<D>__{it's that she likes you too. that really bothers me. i dunno...}
<A>__{but joe has seen something on the screen sotto:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{... charles...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i know it's stupid. what would she ever like me? i haven't leaned out yet, which the doctor says is gonna hap }
<A>__{but joe has slapped charles' arm, his eyes locked to the screen charles looks too and now we see it: through the broken camera lens something moves something big from the train car, through the wreckage what the hell is it? too damn big mostly out of frame, its shape and flesh too bizarre we only see the legs as it clears frame }
<C>__{charles }
<D>__{ joe, what the hell ?!}
<A>__{push in on their faces as they see the alien they've captured on film then from outside: an air raid siren ramps, whining through the town. the boys look at each other afraid. quick close ups as they rewind the film and rip it}
