<L>__{exterior car continuous}
<A>__{heading off the main road into the ghetto. but as they head further and further south, jeremiah's getting uneasy.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{what are we doing down here?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{like you always said, pop, look for the undervalued.}
<A>__{now they are on the old street. as they drive down the street, jeremiah's getting more and more agitated.}
<L>__{exterior blackstone continuous}
<A>__{they park and get out. he looks up and down the street, oddly frightened.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i bet you didn't even know your bank owned the place. i did it through a broker so you wouldn't know it was me. i couldn't wait to see your face when i fixed it up.}
<A>__{it's the building. freshly painted, with the neon sign. but jeremiah's face shows nothing like what patrick expected. nothing but a horrified, angry disgust.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{is this some kind of sick joke?}
<A>__{jeremiah's so angry he almost smacks patrick.}
<C>__{jeremiah }
<D>__{listen to me, boy. i didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i thought you'd be psyched. just trying to do what you did. take nothing and make something out of it.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{no one'll ever come here. shut it down. don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. i will take care of it.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{you'll take care of it? not this time. no way. i bought it fair and square. and we open tonight.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{bullshit! bullshit!! you're selling it back! that's an order!}
<A>__{jeremiah is furious out of all proportions. some of the others on the block have stuck their noses out to see what the fuss is. then jeremiah comes eye to eye with pearl, standing across the street, watching, worried out of her mind. then he looks up and sees shotgun in the window. feeling trapped, humiliated. he wants out of this street. out of those glances.}
<C>__{jeremiah }
<D>__{you all are coming back to the house, now!}
<A>__{nobody moves. jeremiah walks back to his car and pulls away. patrick, frozen, turned to stone by rage and hurt and shame. another car pulls up. several young people inside. they look around a little dubiously.}
<C>__{clubber}
<D>__{man, i think we're lost. you guys know where illibent is?}
<A>__{they all look at each other. silent. until maurice answers by flipping a switch igniting the neon sign for the first time. illibent shines in brilliant blue gas letters. down the block later the deuce and a quarter stops in front of a storefront. a young nefertiti in platforms and dashiki picks fresh fruit and vegetables from the small grocery. pearl vaughn.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{pull over. i will walk the rest.}
<A>__{pearl's picking ripe fruit. jimmy steps in, catches her hands, and the melon in them, in his hands.}
<C>__{bones }
<D>__{naw, all wrong. first, start at the belly button.}
<A>__{he strokes his thumb over the end of the cantaloupe, leaning in to her.}
<C>__{bones }
<D>__{gotta be an in ey and gotta be smooth. if it's ragged, it was picked too soon. won't ever be ripe. second, it's got to have just a little give, here.}
<P>__{(his hands on her hips)}
<D>__{at the edges. and last, but not very far from least...}
<P>__{(now only a breath apart)}
<D>__{you gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{i don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.}
<A>__{she chooses the latter, they kiss.}
