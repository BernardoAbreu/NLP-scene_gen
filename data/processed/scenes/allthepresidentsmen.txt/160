<A>__{clicking away. the words "interview with x. sept. 14" are visible. there is music in the background, really blasting away, rachmaninoff or worse. we are in woodward's apartment and bernstein is dictating notes from the bookkeeper interview. it's very late, and bernstein has notes on everything, matchboxes, and it's hard for him to read. they're both really excited, bernstein from his coffee jag, woodward by what bernstein's dictating.}

<D>__{ok, go on.}
<A>__{the noise blasts away as bernstein and woodward hunch over the typewriter. it's a moment of genuine exhilaration. paranoid, sure, but for the first time, they're really on to something; it's all starting to split open...}
