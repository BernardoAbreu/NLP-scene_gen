<A>__{a graduation ceremony is in progress. we dolly past the bland faces of teary eyed graduates until we stop on enid. at first, we only see the top of her mortarboard; as she lifts her head we see that she's trying desperately not to laugh. she makes eye contact with rebecca, another graduate, who is also trying to stifle her laughter. the speaker is in an elaborate wheelchair with severe looking traction devices.}

<D>__{high school is like the training wheels for the bicycle of real life. it is a time for young people to explore different fields of interest and to hopefully grow from their experiences. after all, that which we learn from our mistakes can be as valuable as what we learn from our textbooks, and often we can turn the negative experiences that are common to all high schoolers into positive steps toward personal growth and achievement. in coming to terms with my own personal setback, which i'm sure you've all heard about, i've been able to learn a lot about myself. i've learned for one thing that i don't need to rely on drugs and alcohol}

<D>__{and i've learned that to get through life's obstacles you need faith, hope and, most of all, a sense of humor.}
