<A>__{the garage doors slide open. one car surges up the ramp ahead of all the others, stopping at the top. the driver of this first car is st. luc, sleek and exuberant, a raised collar and a scarf hiding most of his scars. he glances into his rear view mirror. in the rear view mirror, st. luc sees all the other cars lining up behind him, lights blazing. st. luc smiles, then steps on the accelerator. his car shoots out into the street. as st. luc's car turns on to the street, car after car follows him. we rise higher and higher above the starliner towers apartment complex until the cars are a small stream of lights far below, bleeding into the main body of the neon lit metropolis.}
