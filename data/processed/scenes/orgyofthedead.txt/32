<L>__{exterior woods morning}
<A>__{at the clearing in the woods near the car wreck, bob and shirley are lying on their backs on the ground, just as they were after the crash, before they got up to investigate the strange music that led them to the ghouls. there are two doctors examining bob and shirley. in the foreground, we see a reporter's shoulder and hands. he is writing down details of the accident in a small paper pad.}
<D>__{doctor #1 easy, miss, everything's gonna be alright.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{bob? bob? doctor #1 he's right here beside you. he'll be alright too.}
<A>__{the reporter walks around and crouches beside shirley and doctor #1, and continues writing in his pad. a newspaper photographer crouches in the foreground to get a shot of the accident scene and victims.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{where are they, where did they go? they tried to kill me. doctor #2 what's this you say? who was going to kill you?}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{the ghouls they all turned into skeletons. doctor #2 take it easy, miss. doctor #1 what she needs is a good rest.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{it's true, i tell you, it's true! they all turned into skeletons. she she cut me here.}
<A>__{shirley points to her abdomen where the princess of darkness had made the x with her fingernail. nurse crouches down and pulls out a length of medical tape, then hands it to the doctor. she cuts another piece of tape, but the doctors don't realize this and leave her hanging...}
<D>__{doctor #1 probably was bruised in the crash. doctor #2 you know, you two were very lucky.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{i love you bob. i really do. forgive me?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{there's nothing to forgive. it was all a dream.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{you love me then?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{of course i do.}
<A>__{the doctors put shirley onto a stretcher while the photographer takes more pictures. they put her into the back of an ambulance. then after the doctor listens to bob's neck with a stethoscope, bob just gets up and walks into the back of the ambulance.}
<C>__{criswell }
<D>__{as it is with all the night people, they are destroyed by the first rays of the sun. but upon the first appearance of the deep shadows of the night, and when the moon is full, they will return, to rejoice...in their evil lust, and take back with them any mortal who might happen along.}
