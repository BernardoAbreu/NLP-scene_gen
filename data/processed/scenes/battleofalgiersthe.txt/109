<L>__{108 nlf leaders' hiding place. inside. day.}
<A>__{in the dim light, the four faces are barely illuminated. the shadows tone down their expressions: kader, ali la pointe, ramel, si mourad. they are crowded into the hiding place, sitting on the floor, motionless, their eyes staring straight ahead, their breathing heavy. from outside, noises, voices that are fading in the distance. silence. then, a discreet knock, a remark in arabic. the four breathe deeply, look at each other, then smile a little. ali unslips the beam which, placed through an iron ring, is holding shut the door of the hiding place. using the soles of his feet, he pushes against the square of wall: the light enters violently. it is not electric light, but daylight. kader blinks his eyes to accustom them to the light, then goes out on all fours; after him, ramel, and then the others. they leave the hiding place that ali built in the wash house on the terrace.}
