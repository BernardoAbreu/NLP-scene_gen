<A>__{tony blair and cherie at home, watching television. it's 10 o'clock. the kids are in bed, but their toys are still strewn around the sitting room. tony is tidying them up into boxes.. on screen: british historian david starkey is lambasting charles. tony and cherie sit on the sofa, watching television, eating pasta on their knees. starkey defends the queen. part of an older generation. she knows no better.}
<C>__{cherie }
<D>__{how much of all this could be the first stirrings of..}
<C>__{tony}
<C>__{w}
<D>__{hat?}
<C>__{herie}
<D>__{..i don't know...something more interesting. maybe this time people have finally seen them for what they are.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{which is?}
<C>__{cherie}
<D>__{a bunch of freeloading, emotionally retarded...nutters.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(rolls eyes)}
<D>__{that's just absurd.}
<C>__{cherie}
<D>__{why? they exist in a ludicrous cocoon of privilege and wealth. they don't pay tax.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{yes, they do.}
<C>__{cherie}
<D>__{the queen alone costs us what? thirty, forty million a year..}
<A>__{tony reaches the door, and turns..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{ot you, too. look...if you want to have a serious conversation about this..}
<C>__{cherie}
<D>__{i do..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{..about the constitution..}
<C>__{cherie}
<D>__{e don't have one..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{...or about ways in which we as a government could begin to phase out hereditary privileges, then fine.}
<C>__{herie}
<P>__{(indicating plates)}
<D>__{if you're going, take the dishes..}
<A>__{tony comes back to take the dirty plates..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{but spare me the whole.."off with their heads" thing.}
<C>__{cherie}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{because it insults your intelligence.}
<C>__{cherie}
<D>__{"the case for reform is simple and obvious. it is in principle wrong and absurd that people should wield power on the basis of birth, not merit or election."}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{your words, not mine.}
<A>__{tony is momentarily thrown..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{well, maybe now i've grown up.}
<P>__{a beat)}
<D>__{it's unimaginable this country being a republic. certainly in her lifetime.}
<C>__{cherie}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{because...no would would wear it.}
<P>__{(can't help laughing at the idea)}
<D>__{no one wants it.}
<P>__{(gestures)}
<D>__{it's just...daft.}
<A>__{tony heads for the door..}
<C>__{herie}
<D>__{it's not a mother thing, is it?}
<A>__{tony turns..}
<C>__{cherie}
<D>__{think about it. if she were still alive, wouldn't hazel be exactly the same age? whenever you talk about your mother, you mention her stoicism. her frugality. her sense of duty. the fact she was brought up in the way. well c'mon..?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{who does that sound like?}
<A>__{tony smiles.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i'm going to do the washing up.}
