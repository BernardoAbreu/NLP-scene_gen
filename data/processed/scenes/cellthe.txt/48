<L>__{interior kern county hospital examination room night}
<A>__{a human eye. no movement, no deviation of the iris. a fixed stare. the catatonic stargher lies in a hospital bed, wrists cuffed to the frame. an iv feeds him fluids and monitors report his vital signs. as a nervous nurse exits, we see two policemen standing guard in the outer hallway. novak, ramsey and teddy lee stand by as the killer is examined by dr. milton reid, a brilliant forensic m.d. currently shining an opthalmoscope into stargher's eyes. he pulls away and checks the electroencenphelogram already on a lightbox.}
<C>__{reid}
<D>__{minimal activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. and here, the anterior cingulate cortex.}
<P>__{(to novak and ramsey)}
<D>__{it's what helps distinguish between external and internal stimuli.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{what the hell does that mean?}
<C>__{teddy lee}
<P>__{(answering for reid)}
<D>__{he's schizophrenic.}
<A>__{novak doesn't like this. not one bit.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{what're you doing here, reid? paving the way for his insanity defense?}
<C>__{reid}
<D>__{no need. there won't be a trial. this is no act. the coma is real.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{whoa. wait a minute.}
<C>__{reid}
<D>__{you ever hear of whalen's infraction?}
<A>__{clearly not.}
<C>__{reid }
<P>__{(re: the eeg)}
<D>__{in any schizophrenic, these areas would be affected. but in someone with whalen's, they're hit hard and hit fast.}
<A>__{novak's worry intensifies.}
<C>__{reid }
<D>__{stargher's neurological system was infected by a virus in utero. it lay dormant. in his case for about...}
<P>__{(guesses at stargher's age)}
<D>__{...thirty years. most likely, he's exhibited symptoms for awhile now, but the infraction the breach didn't occur 'til today. you never know when it'll happen, at what age, or why. the triggers vary, but the results don't.}
<P>__{(fascinated by stargher)}
<D>__{he has no ties to reality. no awareness of this world or the people in it.}
<C>__{teddy lee}
<D>__{what about thorazine? or... desoxyn?}
<C>__{reid}
<D>__{the normal psychotropics don't work. he's not just catatonic, he's... disappeared. like having a dream and never waking up.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{this girl. julia hickson. only he knows where she is.}
<C>__{reid}
<D>__{then i'm sorry. for her and for you.}
<A>__{novak is past angry. he's bordering on devastation. ramsey attempts to placate him.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{we'll go back to his house, pete. there's still a lot to do. analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records. maybe he owns property somewhere.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{they're in that fucking thing for forty hours, gordon. four oh. he got julia at seven thirty last night. you know what time it is now...?!}
<A>__{ramsey backs off, knowing his partner is on the verge of really losing it. reid thinks perhaps he shouldn't, but sensitive to novak's pain and anger, mentions it anyway if only to keep his friend from true hopelessness.}
<C>__{reid}
<D>__{peter? this is a longshot. i mean a real long shot. you're gonna think i'm crazy...}
