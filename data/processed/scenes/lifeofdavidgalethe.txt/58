<L>__{interior television studio control booth day}
<A>__{two people sit in front of monitors displaying various angles on sound stage. the main monitor is playing the end of the show's signation.}
<C>__{assistant director}
<D>__{in three, two...}
<B>__{on sound stage}
<A>__{a camera operator cues the host (50s, male, bow tie). the host is flanked by david and governor hardin. the set has an upscale regional television look. the governor has the rare ability to look comfortable while david fidgets.}
<C>__{host}
<P>__{(to camera)}
<D>__{welcome back to 'batter's box.' tonight we continue our very special four part series with the governor hardin. arguing capital punishment with her is deathwatch coordinator, professor david gale. governor, you're up.}
<C>__{governor hardin}
<D>__{alan, let me say somethin' i always say.}
<A>__{constance stands behind the cameras. she motions to david something about the papers in front of him.}
<C>__{governor hardin}
<D>__{and i'm gonna keep on sayin.' and that is i hate killin.' that's why my administration is willing to kill to stop it.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{so you don't subscribe to the idea that 'a good state is one that protects its most despised members'?}
<C>__{governor hardin}
<D>__{it's a nice liberal idea, but like most nice liberal ideas, naive.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's a quote from you, governor, from your first state attorney campaign.}
<A>__{constance is biting her lip, breaks into a smile. the governor is unsure how to react, then laughs. the host chuckles with her.}
<C>__{governor hardin}
<D>__{you've got me, professor. but let me, in my defense, give you a quote. winston churchill: 'if you're not a liberal at twenty, you've got no heart, if you're still a liberal at thirty, you've got no brain.'}
<A>__{the host's laughter is overdone. david smiles. constance bites her lip.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{so, basically you feel, to choose another quote, 'society must be cleansed of elements which represent its own death.'}
<A>__{the governor makes an animated thinking face.}
<C>__{governor hardin}
<D>__{well, yes. i would have to agree.}
<P>__{(chuckles again)}
<D>__{did i say that, too?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no, ma'am. that was hitler.}
<A>__{constance makes a "yes!" gesture with her hands. the governor is surprised into silence. the host laughs and, noting her reaction, trails off. david becomes more confident, his tone more sincere.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{governor, can't we examine the possibility that capital punishment isn't working. that murderers aren't deterred by the law because they have about as much forethought as lemmings. that it's expensive, inequably administered, that...}
<A>__{david cuts his eyes briefly to constance.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{...that we may even be killing innocents.}
<A>__{constance rolls her eyes. the governor is ready for this.}
<C>__{governor hardin}
<D>__{all righty, mr. gale, i will play your game. name one. name one innocent man texas has put to death in my tenure. one.}
<A>__{a beat. david doesn't respond.}
<C>__{governor hardin}
<D>__{name one in the last twenty years. in any state in this country.}
<A>__{a long, miserable beat.}
<C>__{host}
<D>__{well, mr. gale?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{dead men can't make a case.}
<C>__{governor hardin}
<D>__{well, as my daddy used to say: if you can't find a problem, there probably isn't one.}
<A>__{constance shakes her head in irritation. backstage later the show is over. david and the governor are shaking hands. constance stands nearby.}
<C>__{governor hardin}
<D>__{well, you certainly had me on that hitler quote.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{thank you, governor.}
<C>__{governor hardin}
<D>__{these debates are awfully good for the state, don't you think?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{governor hardin}
<D>__{well, i've got to buzz.}
<A>__{she moves toward her handlers.}
<C>__{governor hardin}
<D>__{you folks keep up the good work. we need that opposition.}
<A>__{constance's and david's polite smiles follow her.}
