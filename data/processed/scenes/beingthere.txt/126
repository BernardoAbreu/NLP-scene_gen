<A>__{the rand 1 limousine pulls up to sophie's house. jeffrey opens the door for eve and chance. he wears ben's tuxedo, eve is in a formal gown. the press is waiting, a couple of reporters, 5 photographers and a mini cam crew from local tv station gather around eve and chance.}
<D>__{reporter #1 mr. gardiner, what did you think of the post's editorial on the president's speech?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(smiling for photogs)}
<D>__{i didn't read it. reporter #2}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{but air you must have at least glanced at it.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{no. i did not glance at it. reporter #3 mr. gardiner, the new york times spoke of your 'peculiar brand of optimism,' what was your reaction to that?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(continues to pose for pictures)}
<D>__{i did not read that either. reporter #3 well, how do you feel about that phrase, 'peculiar brand of optimism?'}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i do not know what it means. reporter #2 sorry to persist, air, but it would be of great interest to me to know what newspapers you do read.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i do not read any newspapers. i watch tv.}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence as the reporters digest this. the tv reporter smiles, questions chance.}
<C>__{tv reporter}
<D>__{... do you mean, mr. gardiner, that you find television's coverage of the news superior to that of the newspapers?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{i like to watch tv.}
<C>__{tv reporter}
<P>__{(pleased) )}
<D>__{thank you, mr. gardiner, for what is probably the most honest admission to come from a public figure in years. few men in public life have the courage not to read newspapers none have the guts to admit it.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{eve and chance walk toward the front door, leaving the newsmen to talk among themselves.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, chauncey. you're so cool and detached almost as if you were born to it.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{thank you, eve.}
<A>__{the front door is opened for them by an attendant.}
