<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{the guy was history when he killed kelly. you knew that.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{but then you knew what he was like all along... maybe his killing kelly was a thing you had counted on...}

<D>__{but then it is better this way, don't you think? no loose ends.}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{okay. come here and take the helm. i will get the winch.}
<A>__{suzie gives him her best, gap toothed smile, then comes forward to take the gleaming chrome wheel, as sam scrambles up on deck, kneeling where ray had kneeled before him to set the jib. suzie watches a long beat, then, slowly reaches behind her, unhooking the line which holds the boom...}
