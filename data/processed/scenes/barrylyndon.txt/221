<D>__{my lady cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one. her life was passed in a series of crack brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me. we would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes. one day, i was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth. she suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{roderick, you know well enough that i have never loved but you! was i ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? ever so angry, but the least offer of good will on your part did not bring me to your side? did i not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of england upon you? have i repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? no, i loved you too much and too fondly; i have always loved you. from the first moment i saw you, i saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but i could not help loving you. i married you, though i knew i was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty. what sacrifice do you want from me? i am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.}
