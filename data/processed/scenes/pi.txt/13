<L>__{interior max's bathroom night}
<A>__{max splashes water on his face.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{please god, let it be a small one.}
<A>__{he pulls a metal vaccinating gun out of the medicine cabinet. then be loads it with a small bottle of medicine. he rolls up his sleeve, dabs alcohol on his arm, and fires the gun into his arm.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{sixteen thirty five. second headache in under twenty four hours. they're getting more frequent now...more painful, too. drugs don't work, just take the edge off of it. just gotta wait for the nosebleed. relief comes from my nose.}
<A>__{next door, he hears devi and her boyfriend talking.}
<C>__{farrouhk }
<D>__{so i gotta make this drop off in harlem and on the way down there's these three kids hailing me.}
<A>__{max slaps himself in the face a few times.}
<C>__{devi }
<D>__{you stopped?}
<C>__{farrouhk }
<D>__{i was tight, so...}
<A>__{max watches his thumb twitch. and then pain shoots through him. he grabs the right side of his head, massages it, and pushes it in with his fingers. in the mirror, he examines the right side of his scalp. he sees nothing}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{ahh...}
<A>__{max walks back into the}
<B>__{main room}
<A>__{and sits down in a chair. the lamp is blinding so he snaps it off. only the bathroom light lights the room. he takes a few breaths.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{leave me alone.}
<A>__{his neighbors conversation begins to build in volume and distortion.}
<C>__{farrouhk }
<D>__{so i drop them off in the village and they dart.}
<C>__{devi }
<D>__{oh god...}
<A>__{max gags and rubs his head.}
<C>__{farrouhk }
<D>__{i get out, grab my bat and start running. one of the kids, maybe sixteen, i catch a block later he's cursing at me, calling me a paki bastard. so i whacked him, right in the head.}
<C>__{devi }
<D>__{farrouhk!}
<A>__{the pain seems to disappear. max looks at his hand that was rubbing his bead. then he looks at the front door. the doorknob seems to move. something begins knocking on max's door. the knocking gets louder and louder then the locks begin to unlock. farrouhk's words begin to overpower max.}
<C>__{farrouhk }
<D>__{i'm kicking the bastard in the ribs banging his ass, knocking his head against the curb, harder and harder, i fucking lost it. a hot dog guy starts screaming "you're cracking his skull, you're cracking his skull." so they pulled me off of him and calmed me down. cops said he had it coming to him.}
<A>__{then something starts pounding the door. the doorknob quivers, the locks unbolt. the chains are the only thing keeping out the intruder. the door shakes and the chains are strained. max is paralyzed with terror.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no! no!}
<A>__{and then the door smashes open. blinding light fills the room and we crash into the}
<B>__{blinding white void}
<A>__{a moment of silence, then we}
