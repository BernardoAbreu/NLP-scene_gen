<L>__{interior gymnasium night}
<A>__{jean is working out on an average sized set of free weights, sweating, pushing hard. obviously the sound logan heard. she is on her back doing presses. suddenly, she looks up and sees logan standing over. she is startled and starts to drop the bar. he catches it.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{you should always work with a spotter.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{heis busy right now.}
<A>__{logan cannot help but glance at her left hand, still clinging to the bar. the shimmering diamond on the third finger.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{i was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{were you now?}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{what do you say?}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{not interested.}
<A>__{logan shrugs, starts to take his hands away. jean is not ready to take the weight of the bar. it almost comes down on her when he catches it again.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{let go.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{suit yourself.}
<A>__{and he does. and so does jean at the same time. she gets up and faces logan the bar simply hovers in mid air. logan smiles.}
