<L>__{interior death's office night}
<A>__{it looks like the observation bridge in the nose of the nautilus; the decor is ornate, and the office equipment vacuum tubes, pipe intercoms, etc. is on loan from the jules verne museum of defunct technology. reapers are bustling about everywhere. one of them pushing a hand truck laden with oversized crates bearing the label "dead souls."}
<C>__{reaper}
<D>__{batch of souls just back from processing.}
<C>__{death's assistant}
<D>__{put them over there with the others.}
<A>__{he unloads the crates in a corner of the room, where scores of crated souls are already piled up.}
<C>__{death's assistant}
<D>__{your grimness? we have a new shipment }
<C>__{death }
<D>__{yeah, yeah, yeah... i will get to it...}
<A>__{we can't see death himself just the back of a tall swivel chair. with much creaking, it rotates around bringing us face to face with... closeup death he's not at all what you'd expect. he's a chubby cheeked, bespectacled accountant type...a harried bureaucrat, just trying to do his job. there's something sweet, almost avuncular about him. there's an open crate of dead souls on his desk. dead souls take the form of perforated paper dolls...two dimensional, underwear clad, usually wearing expressions of shock. death pulls a sheet from the box, detaches the dead soul, and outfits it with a cut out toga. now he places it in a big diorama with oodles of toga clad souls staring up at a scale model of an active volcano. he throws a switch and beams as the volcano spits blobs of ketchup into the air.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{last days of pompeii...now there was a great moment in death.}
<C>__{death's assistant}
<D>__{if i may point out...it is 12:05...}
<A>__{death, grumbling, digs into the box and pulls out another soul. his eyes light up. he clutches the sheet with trembling hands.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{i can't believe oh, man, i sinatra!! do you know how long i've been waiting for this?}
<A>__{sure enough, the doll on the sheet is ol' blue eyes. death digs in a desk drawer and pulls out a shoebox diorama...dino and sammy standing at microphones, with a third, center mike conspicuously open.}
<C>__{death's assistant}
<D>__{make that 12:07, your bleakness...the dispatch team is waiting...}
<A>__{grumpy, death shoves frank, dean, and sammy back in the drawer.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{okay, okay, send 'em in. jeez.}
