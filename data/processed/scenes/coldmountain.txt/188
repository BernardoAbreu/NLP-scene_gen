<L>__{exterior cherokee village. day}
<A>__{ada comes out of stobrod's hut, a glimpse of inman sleeping on the floor, heads for another hut which ruby is sweeping out. the snow has stopped. ada stands in the door, watches ruby. ruby's resistance to inman is palpable.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{he's asleep. they both are.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{i'm not surprised. your man looks played out.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i saw him. i realize now.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{saw him when?}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{in sally swanger's well. a tunnel of trees. the man like a black smudge in the snow, the sun behind him.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{well there you are.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{funny thing is it wasn't the same. the image. it wasn't snowing. and in the well, he was, as if he were falling.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{you probably don't remember it right.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i remember it exactly. there were crows, these black crows flying towards me. i thought i was seeing him fall. instead i was seeing him come back to me. all this while i've been packing ice around my heart. how will i make it melt?}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{better get a fire going.}
<P>__{(goes to the fireplace)}
<D>__{i've got big plans for that farm. got a vision in my mind of how that cove needs to be.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i know you have.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{there's not a thing we can't do ourselves.}
