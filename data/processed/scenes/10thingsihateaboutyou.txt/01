<L>__{interior girls' room day}
<A>__{bianca stratford, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the mirror, applying lipstick. her less extraordinary, but still cute friend, chastity stands next to her.}

<D>__{no.}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{you might wanna think about it}

<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(adoring)}
<D>__{hey, bianca.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{awesome shoes.}
<A>__{the greetings continue as chastity remains wordless and unaddressed by her side. bianca smiles proudly, acknowledging her fans. guidance counselor's office day cameron james, a clean cut, easy going senior with an open, farm boy face, sits facing miss perky, an impossibly cheery guidance counselor.}
<C>__{miss perky}
<D>__{i'm sure you won't find padua any different than your old school. same little asswipe mother fuckers everywhere.}
<A>__{her plastic smile never leaves her face. cameron fidgets in his chair uncomfortably.}

<D>__{i don't think so, ma'am}
<C>__{miss perky}
<D>__{then go forth. scoot i've got deviants to see.}
<A>__{cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with patrick verona, a sullen looking bad ass senior who waits outside ms perky's door. his slouch and smirk let us know how cool he is. miss perky looks down at her file and up at patrick}
<C>__{miss perky}
<D>__{patrick verona. i see we're making our visits a weekly ritual.}
<A>__{she gives him a withering glance. he answers with a charming smile.}

<C>__{miss perky}
<D>__{it says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{it was a bratwurst. i was eating lunch.}
<C>__{miss perky}
<D>__{with the teeth of your zipper?}
<A>__{she motions for patrick to enter her office and cameron shuffles out the door, bumping into michael eckman, a lanky, brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game show host.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you the new guy?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{so they tell me...}
