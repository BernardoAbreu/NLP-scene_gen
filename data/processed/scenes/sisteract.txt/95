<C>__{eddie's voice}
<D>__{hey, don't thank me or anything.}

<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{i have submitted my resignation to bishop o'hara. privately. i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{but why?}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{i must go where i can be of use.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{but there's so much more to do right here. and look, if it's about me, i mean, i'm gone.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{indeed. after how long? a few weeks? i have been here thirty years. and yet, it would seem, i know nothing.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{but everything that's happening is good! you can be a part of it!}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{a part of what? mary clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday. you have raised the sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them. they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.}
<C>__{mother superior }
<D>__{you and i know that life is not so simple. there will be disappointments. rude shocks. and you will have vanished. how... fortunate.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{okay, so i just got things started. but you could build on that. you could keep it going.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{i am sorry, mary clarence. i seem to have misplaced my tambourine. good day, mary clarence.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{but...}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{good day.}
<A>__{christy, frustrated, leaves the room. mother superior looks up, she is truly torn, a proud woman unsure of her choices.}
