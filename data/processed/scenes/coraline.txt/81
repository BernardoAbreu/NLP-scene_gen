<A>__{a huge armoire bug suddenly crab steps in her path, blocking the little door, and all around her things start to glow. the room has been transformed into an amazing bug museum, with all sorts of glowing, living specimens in the place of the old furniture and furnishings. the radiators are now big caterpillars, the nordic track a serving bug. the other mother speaks out, startling coraline.}
<C>__{other mother }
<D>__{they say even the proudest }
<A>__{the sofa, now a large bug, turns in place to reveal her sitting on it.}
<C>__{other mother }
<D>__{ spirit can be broken ... with love.}
<A>__{she's all smiles, button eyes shining, one hand held out in a behold my handiwork gesture. a bug chair scoops up coraline and brings her to the other mother. the other mother takes a candy dish from the servant bug.}
<C>__{other mother }
<D>__{of course, chocolate never hurts. like one?}
<A>__{she extends a candy dish filled living chocolate beetles.}
<C>__{other mother }
<D>__{they're cocoa beetles from zanzibar.}
<A>__{coraline is disgusted. the other mother takes back the dish and bites off the head of one. it's the first thing she's eaten in the film.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{i want to be with my real mom and dad. i want you to let me go.}
<A>__{the other mother frowns, swallows. she speaks with a frightening steeliness in her voice.}
<C>__{other mother}
<D>__{is that any way to talk to your mother?}
<A>__{coraline is mad, and feeling mad makes her brave.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{you aren't my mother.}
<A>__{the other mother straightens. her button eyes, now dead, stare into coraline's.}
<C>__{other mother}
<D>__{apologize at once, coraline!}
<A>__{coraline stares right back, not blinking.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{other mother}
<P>__{(tensely)}
<D>__{i will give you to the count of three. one...}
<A>__{then she stands up, growing taller.}
<C>__{other mother }
<D>__{...two...}
<A>__{she grows taller still and scarier like a super model on steroids.}
<C>__{tall other mother}
<D>__{...three!}

<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{ow, what are you doing!}
