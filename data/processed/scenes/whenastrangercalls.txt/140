<C>__{duncan }
<D>__{have you checked the children?}
<A>__{jill screams and falls to the floor.}
<B>__{angle on john}
<A>__{around him, other diners fall instantly silent and wonder what is going on. waiters stop dead in their tracks. john leaps up from his seat and dashes through the tables like a madman. suddenly the restaurant comes alive with excitement and alarm.}
<B>__{angle on jill}
<A>__{as john runs up and drops to his knees beside her. she is shaking and sobbing uncontrollably.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{jill, what's happening? what's wrong?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{it was him! somebody call the police! help me!}
<A>__{other people have crowded around and are making urgent noises now about calling the police, an ambulance, etc. john tries to cut through the confusion and anxiety.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{wait a minute! just hold on! sweetheart, what was him? what are you talking about?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{that man... curt duncan... he's home again! he's got our children!}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{he was on the phone?}
<A>__{jill nods. john grabs the telephone and quickly dials a number. the crowd tries to quiet down, as much to hear for themselves as to let john talk. the phone rings and rings. finally...}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hello, carol, it's mr. lockhart. what's going on over there?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{nothing's going on.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{is everything all right?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{yes, there's nothing }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{everything's fine. why? what's ?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{carol, listen to me very carefully. if there's a man in the house, if there's any reason why you can't talk to me right now, just answer yes to me over the phone. that's all. if there's any danger of any kind, just say yes.}
<A>__{long pause. they wait for her answer. jill is listening into the receiver now, too.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i don't understand what's happening. what man in the house?}
<A>__{jill is confused. john breathes a guarded sigh of relief. jill takes the phone.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{carol, it's mrs. lockhart. answer me truthfully. when was the last time you looked in on the children?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{about forty five minutes ago. everything's fine. they were fast asleep.}
<A>__{jill gives her husband a look. john takes the phone again.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{carol, i'm sorry about all the hysterics. we're leaving the restaurant now. we'll explain everything when we get home. before we hang up, could you do just one more thing for me, please?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{would you go upstairs and, and check on the children for me?}
<A>__{jill is violently shaking her head. john silences her with a gesture.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{sure. hold on.}
<A>__{carol o.s. puts the phone down. then there is silence on the other end. the crowd of people around jill and john begin to shuffle and murmur. john tries to keep them quiet while listening into the phone. then two policemen come forward through the crowd. one of them kneels down to john and jill who are still on the floor.}
<D>__{policeman #1 what seems to be the problem here, sir?}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{officer, i'm john lockhart. just a second please, and i will explain everything.}
<C>__{jill}
<P>__{(whispering to policeman)}
<D>__{i'm jill johnson, the babysitter seven years ago with the child killer.}
<A>__{this means nothing to policeman #1.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{the babysitter. the guy got into the house and killed the two children upstairs.}
<A>__{policeman #2 kneels down now.}
<D>__{policeman #2}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{oh, yeah, i remember something about that. a greek doctor...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that's right. that's the one. policeman #2}
<P>__{(to policeman #1)}
<D>__{it was in the seventh precinct...}
<A>__{as the two policemen and john mumble between themselves, jill takes the telephone.}
<C>__{jill}
<P>__{(listening)}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{she presses the receiver tighter to her ear.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{carol?}
<A>__{john quiets down the policeman. jill can now hear what she couldn't a second ago.}
<C>__{jill}
<P>__{(growing hysterical)}
<D>__{carol? carol?!}
<A>__{zoom into the telephone until we can also hear what jill is reacting to. it grows louder and louder... a dial tone.}
