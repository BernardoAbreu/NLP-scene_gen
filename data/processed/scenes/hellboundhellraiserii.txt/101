<L>__{interior the brothers' room}
<A>__{the door that kirsty opens gives directly on to a room. like the sitting room earlier this appears to be an ordinary room and not a stone wall chamber. it's wall papered walls were once white but are now yellowed and old. overhead there is an equally ancient four bladed wooden fan that turns sluggishly. in the middle of the floor is a small low table of vaguely eastern design. on this table lie a hand of cards, face down, an empty and cloudy tumbler, and a soiled ashtray. over by the far wall (the wall opposite to that containing the door) there is a mattress on the floor. a body like shape on this mattress is obscured by a heavy blanket that covers it. to the side of the mattress a latticed wooden screen stands, hiding whatever is behind it from those entering the room. if the atmosphere of the room reminds us of anything it is of the seedy bazaar where frank first bought the lament configuration. we are looking at the door as it opens inwards and kirsty slowly and nervously walks into the room. kirsty advances into the room. she stares at the mattress ahead of her. above it written in blood on the wall, is the message she saw in her vision. i am in hell:help me.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{daddy...}
<A>__{a low moan comes from the far end of the room. kirsty assumes it issues from the figure hidden beneath the blanket and walks nearer, lifting her arm in readiness to remove the blanket.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{daddy. it's kirsty...}
<A>__{there is no response. kirsty arrives at the mattress and pulls the blanket back. she leaps backwards, her hand at her mouth stifling a scream. lying on the bed is a husk like figure, vaguely female in shape. despite its appearance of long decay, it is dressed in vaguely sexual garments of leather. suddenly, the eyes pop open, revealing a vague remnant of life.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{oh god.}
<A>__{kirsty hurriedly, throws the blanket back over it. a voice issues into the room. it sounds like larry but, as we shall see, it is not.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{no. over here. behind the screen.}
<A>__{kirsty walks carefully around the screen, giving it a wide berth in case of a trick. there is a figure standing against the wall behind the screen. it is deeply shadowed by the screen itself but is clearly male. kirsty gulps back a sob and her eyes fill with tears.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{daddy... ?}
<A>__{the figure leans slowly into the light, speaking as he does so.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's it, baby. come to daddy.}
<A>__{kirsty stands still. there is a second where her face registers nothing. then she screams.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{it is her uncle frank, back in his skin and dressed in white shirt and jeans. frank chuckles. kirsty backs away from him into the room. frank puts out his right hand in a placatory gesture. kirsty realises he is not moving after her. she also sees that his body is curiously angled, the left side still in the deep shadow cast by the screen. is there something else there? something she can't quite see? frank's voice stops her wondering.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what's the matter, kirsty? it's only frank. it's only uncle frank.}
<A>__{kirsty's anger at being tricked wins over her fear and distress and she shouts at frank in fury.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i should have known! i should've known he wouldn't be here! this place is only for filth like you!}
<A>__{frank sneers.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh, right. daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{shit. bull. shit}
<A>__{frank pauses and smiles. then he begins to move more fully into the room, shifting his weight as he does so and dragging what was hidden into the light. kirsty screams again. frank's white shirt is cut off at the left shoulder. his arm is bare and, from the elbow down to the wrist, joined to another forearm. the flesh is completely fused, like that of siamese twins. as frank moves into the room, the owner of the other arm is revealed. it is his brother, larry. kirsty's father. larry, like his brother, is dressed in a white shirt (cut off at one shoulder) and jeans and, like his brother, has his skin back. his face is frozen into a permanent expression of terror and he seems incapable of any independent movement, simply being pulled along by frank. kirsty steps back in horror.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{see? he's here. you should learn to believe your uncle frank.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{no! he shouldn't be here! it should've been a trick!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{'fraid not, baby. he belongs here. with me. we're the same. brothers. equal and opposite. pure appetite. pure banality. too much feeling. none at all.}
<A>__{kirsty's fear of frank is now outweighed by her contempt for his argument.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{you're full of shit, frank cotton. my dad wasn't like that at all. he could feel. he could love. he loved me.}
<A>__{kirsty's voice breaks.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{he...he loved me.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't waste your tears. look at him!}
<A>__{her hatred for frank gives kirsty her strength back.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{he loved me, you bastard! he loved me, he loved my mother. he even loved that bitch you betrayed him with!}
<A>__{frank begins to move towards kirsty again, larry dragging behind him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{ah, julia. she hasn't been to see me recently. that's why it's so nice to have you here, baby. daddy's little girl. so pretty when she's upset. come to daddy,}
<A>__{frank is very close to her, now. kirsty attempts to run across the room. frank siezes her arm and throws her back against the wall. he moves in close and presses against her. his voice is midway between arousal and anger.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{now don't be naughty, kirsty. or i will have to punish you first. perhaps you'd like that. would you like that?}
<A>__{kirsty screams and stares pleadingly, at the still frozen larry.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{daddy! daddy! i love you! help me!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm your daddy now, kirsty.}
<A>__{frank leans in to kiss the terrified kirsty. suddenly, a hand appears at frank's throat and hurls him off kirsty. it is larry, roused by his daughter's cries.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{get your fucking hands off my daughter, you bastard!}
<A>__{suddenly, the room, previously full of slow movements and tension, is full of furious, violent action as the fused brothers kick, tear, and punch at each other in a paroxysm of killing hatred.}
