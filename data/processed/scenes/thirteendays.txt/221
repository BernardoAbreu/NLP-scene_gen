<A>__{the destroyer's guns hammer away at the groznyy, at point blank range... but the groznyy is unharmed. suddenly, in the air above it appear brilliant flares. they light up the ship, brighter than the sun. the destroyer isn't firing deadly rounds... it's firing harmless starshells.}

<A>__{anderson gets in mcnamara's face.}
<C>__{admiral anderson}
<D>__{that ship was firing starshells. starshells. flares, mr. secretary.}
<A>__{everyone's eyes are on the two men. only the chatter of teletype breaks the paralyzing silence. mcnamara blinks, looks down at the plot on the floor. anderson's voice drops to a deadly sotto.}
<C>__{admiral anderson }
<D>__{goddammitt, i've got a job to do. you've been camped out up there since monday night. you're exhausted and you're making mistakes. interfere with me, you will get some of killed. i will not allow that.}
<A>__{mcnamara looks away at the faces of the men in the room.}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{starshells.}
<C>__{admiral anderson}
<D>__{get out of our way, mr. secretary. the navy has been running blockades since the days of john paul jones.}
<A>__{mcnamara turns back. and all trepidation, embarrassment, hesitation are gone. he coldly appraises anderson.}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{i believe the president made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.}
<C>__{admiral anderson}
<D>__{with all due respect, mr. secretary, we were not firing on the ship. firing on a ship means attacking the ship. we were not attacking the ship. we were firing over it.}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{this was not the president's intention when he gave that order. what if the soviets don't see the distention? what if they make the same mistake i just did?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there will be no firing anything near any soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, admiral?}
<C>__{admiral anderson}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{and i will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the president.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{john paul jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, admiral?}
<A>__{he passes his hand over the enormous plot below.}
<C>__{mcnamara }
<D>__{this isn't a blockade.}
<A>__{mcnamara, trembling with anger, awe, whirls to anderson. and his burgeoning insight is born clear, hard and cold.}
<C>__{mcnamara }
<D>__{this, all this, is language, a new vocabulary the likes of which the world has never seen. this is president kennedy communicating with secretary khruschev.}
<A>__{mcnamara jabs his finger out at the plot, and the camera races down, tracking over it, across the vast ebb and flow of information, the delicate ballet of symbols and numerology, this language of steel and human life.}
