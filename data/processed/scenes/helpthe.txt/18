<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{did y'all see the cover of "life" this week? jackie's never looked more regal }
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{ tell raleigh every penny he spends on a colored's bathroom, he'll get back in spades when y'all sell. it's just plain dangerous. everybody knows they carry different diseases than we do. i double.}
