<A>__{she is on the phone, "walter" finishing up his dinner in bg.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{captain, i...no, listen to me, this so called doctor paraded me around my own neighborhood like some kind of derelict mother who couldn't even recognize her own }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he found what he expected to find, what you obviously told him he would find, but it's not }

<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{i thought we had an understanding, i }

<D>__{then i want to see this report, so i can refute it, before it goes to anyone else, all right? fine.}
<A>__{she hangs up. hard. the events of the day have her teetering on the edge, but she's holding on. she pulls herself together and goes to the sink, furiously doing dishes for a silent beat before "walter" looks up from his now empty plate.}
<D>__{"walter" i'm finished. can i go to my room now?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{yes. go on up.}
<A>__{"walter" rises, as christine continues to clean dishes, not looking back at him. exhausted mentally, physically and emotionally. he goes to the door, stops, turns.}
<D>__{"walter" g'night, mommy.}
<A>__{christine fumbles the plate and it smashes to the floor. she turns furiously to "walter."}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{stop saying that! i'm not your mother! and you're not my son!}
<A>__{she moves toward him, her anger coming out at last.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{who are you? why are you doing this to me? damn you! i want my son back!}
<A>__{he tears off as she slumps to the floor, covering her eyes.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i want my son back...god, please... make it stop...just make it stop.}
