<D>__{i got'm!}
<A>__{intercut talley, now back in the cul de sac }
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{can you open them?}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{i opened marlon. i think it's somebody's taxes.}
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{look for names. does it say whose taxes they are?}
<A>__{thomas scrolls through a spread sheet }
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{i don't see any people names. it's all businesses.}
<C>__{talley}

<D>__{they're coming!}
<A>__{thomas abruptly hangs up and the line goes dead in talley's ear. talley recognizes the name as easily as an east coast cop would recognize john gotti, and realizes the stunning import of smith possessing sonny benza's financial records }
<C>__{talley}
