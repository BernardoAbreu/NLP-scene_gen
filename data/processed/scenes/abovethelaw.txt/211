<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{nico}
<A>__{waiting in a barren reception room. several benches, tables; heavy steel mesh over windows nico's pov across room a steel door opens on the far side. out steps a small italian man in his seventies, wearing the faded denim of an inmate.}
<L>__{interior prison corridor long shot day}
<A>__{nico and the small man (frederico larusso) walk together down a long corridor, speaking occasionally, the tension thick between them. behind them, a discreet fifteen paces, walk two armed prison officials. closer larusso and nico the old man never looks directly at nico, yet we sense keenly that he is taking the younger man's measure.}
<C>__{frederico larusso}
<D>__{i am only an old man. an old man with a cancer.}
<A>__{the two are like an old and a young lion, appraising each other using all five senses and more.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{i don't have much time, uncle. so i must speak plainly.}
<A>__{larusso listens. nico waits for a beat. then:}
<C>__{nico}
<P>__{(this is very painful for him)}
<D>__{ for as long as i've been old enough to think, i've hated you and hated everything you stood for.}
<A>__{larusso takes this in without a flicker.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{i was so sure that you and i were on opposite sides of the fence... and that you and your people were destroying this country }
<A>__{nico pauses, glances away across the grounds.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{ the most painful realization of my life was that the people i worked for and you are not far apart.}
<P>__{(meets larusso's eyes)}
<D>__{ and there's not much difference between what you are and what i was.}
<A>__{larusso studies nico a long moment. then takes nico's elbow.}
<B>__{nico and larusso}
<A>__{continue across the grounds.}
<C>__{frederico larusso}
<D>__{i will be candid with you. i knew, probably before you did, that you would be coming to me. i knew what you would ask... and i had every intention of refusing you.}
<A>__{he glances to nico.}
<C>__{frederico larusso}
<D>__{but it is a form of wisdom to know when to cease relying only upon yourself.}
<A>__{he keeps walking.}
<C>__{frederico larusso}
<D>__{you know, of course, that this senator harrison will never live to make his speech tomorrow.}
<P>__{(as nico acknowledges)}
<D>__{you know, too, that as long as this man... this torturer }
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{kurt zagon.}
<C>__{frederico larusso}
<D>__{ as long as this zagon lives, nothing i can do will guarantee your family's safety.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{'ecce non uomine, ecce bestie.' you know dante?}
<P>__{(translates)}
<D>__{'these are not men, these are animals.'}
<A>__{larusso stops, takes a small note pad from his pocket. he quickly scribbles a few lines.}
<C>__{frederico larusso}
<D>__{memorize this address.}
<A>__{he holds the paper for nico to see.}
<C>__{frederico larusso}
<D>__{have you got it in your mind?}
<A>__{nico nods. larusso tears the paper into tiny shreds.}
