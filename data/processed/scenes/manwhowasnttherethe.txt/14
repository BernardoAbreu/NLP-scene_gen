<A>__{ed sits on the front porch of his bungalow, smoking a cigarette in the late afternoon light. a dog barks next door; a distant screen door slams; children are playing somewhere up the street. ed looks down at his watch. it is 5:30. something attracts his attention: at the foot of his driveway stands a man in a cream colored suit and hat. he is a small figure, perfectly still, staring at the gravel driveway. after a beat he lifts up a small clipboard, squints at the house, and jots something down. he finishes writing, screws the lid back onto his pen, and is sticking it into a breast pocket when he realizes he is being watched. his manner instantly warms.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hello!}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{the man starts up the walk.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i notice you still have peastone in your driveway.}
<A>__{yeah.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{well, of course, you don't have to rejuvenate that once every couple of years, don't you, when the peastone thins out.}
<A>__{ed shrugs.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{...where does it go, huh? like the odd sock. but you know where it goes you probably pick pieces of it off your lawn all the time, churn it up with your lawn mower, sweep it off the walk here pain in the neck.}
<A>__{ed shrugs again.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{doesn't bother me.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{well, have you ever considered tar macadam? people think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...}
<A>__{a car pulls into the drive.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{...but we have the technology now to bring it to the homeowner, the individual consumer, at a very reasonable price.}
<A>__{doris emerges from the car.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{...mind if i show you the specifications? evening, ma'am.}
<A>__{doris gives him a hard look.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{what're you selling?}
<A>__{the man gives a practiced laugh.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{well, ma'am, i was just telling your husband here about tar macadam, for your home driveway here these are the specs...}
<A>__{doris takes the brochure he has pulled from a small case.}

<D>__{...it's the modern way to }
<A>__{doris tears the brochure in half and hands it back.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{get lost.}
<A>__{the man gazes at her. his smile fades fast and he and doris stare at each other, two hard cases. he turns stiffly and stalks off. once his gaze has broken, doris turns as well. she stalks up the stairs to the porch and bangs through the screen front door of the house, letting it slam behind her. quiet, early evening. ed sits, smoking. at length he rises and goes in to the house.}
