<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(to bartender)}
<D>__{pinot noir, please. no, you know what? i will have a tanqueray martini very dry with a twist.}
<A>__{jane strums the bar top, checks out the room. it's fun being in a big city. her martini arrives, she takes a sip and hears something very familiar. jake's laugh. she looks across the bar and sees jake talking to the bartender. he seems to be alone. jane waves. jake notices her and smiles.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{where's your....??}
<A>__{jake picks up his drink and carries it to the bar stool next to jane.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{pedro got the stomach flu so i'm flying solo.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{really? didn't know you knew how to be by yourself.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{any chance you could just go easy on me? just a one night free pass.}
<P>__{(noticing her)}
<D>__{you look good, janey.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yeah....}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you do. you always do. your hair's shorter.}
<C>__{jane}

<C>__{host}
<D>__{mrs. adler, your table's ready.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{want some company, mrs. adler?}
<A>__{jane gives jake a doubtful look.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{ we both have to eat.}
<P>__{(sees jane is hesitating)}
<D>__{when's the last time we ate a meal together?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(thinks for a sec)}
<D>__{just the two of us? alone?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{so, come on. once every ten years.}
<B>__{a half hour later}
<A>__{new drinks arrive for jane and jake. physically, they're sitting as close as they've been in a decade.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{so...how are things in the fertility world?}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(checks watch)}
<D>__{i can't believe it took you this long to bring that up.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(trying not to laugh)}
<D>__{sperm issues?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{apparently. yes.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{a baby?! really jake? so...the next time you go to a graduation, you'll be what? fifty eight plus...}
<P>__{(tries to do the math)}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{ i think the number you're looking for is 79.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{okay. so. seriously, how is that good?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{why are we talking about this? i thought we were going to have fun.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{where'd you get that idea?}
<B>__{a bottle of wine is opened}
<A>__{and poured. the bar has filled up and jane and jake are sitting a little closer together.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{ just tell me, how long were you seeing him for?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{oh, please, it was five years ago.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i know but i always wondered so...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{little jealous?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{the man's married now.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i don't care. how long?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{eight months.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{long....}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{not long.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{the bar is now crowded. jane and jake are finally eating but still drinking. jake is telling jane a long story and she can't stop laughing.}
<B>__{omit brandy time}
<A>__{a dj spins for the after dinner crowd. couples dance on the dance floor. jane and jake both react to the song.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{this song reminds me of your birthday party... the one in our old house...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{ oh, yeah. that was such a fun night.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{so fun. you wore that white halter dress....}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{oh, yeahhhh....}
<P>__{(remembering it all, looks}
<D>__{at jake with a longing}
<P>__{for her own past...)}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{want to dance?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{ no...!}
<A>__{the dance floor moments later jake and jane are dancing...it's familiar yet with the blush of the new. something's going on here. jake starts singing. jane joins in. this is by far, the loosest we've seen her. of course, it helps that she's drunk. they dance around one another without inhibition. a mating dance....}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(astonished, laughing)}
<D>__{you're married to someone else...!}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{tell me about it!}
<A>__{they both laugh then jake pulls jane close.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(sexy....)}
<D>__{hey.... i know you.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(looking deeply into her)}
<D>__{and i know you....}
