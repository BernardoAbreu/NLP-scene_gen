<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{ronson is sitting back in the chair, looking at the now slightly calmer kirsty.}
<C>__{ronson}
<D>__{we got two missing people and a house full of corpses.}
<A>__{he holds out his hand towards kirsty in a theatrical manner.}
<C>__{ronson}
<D>__{talk to me.}
<A>__{kirsty swings her legs off the bad, but remains sitting on it, her feet on the floor. she doesn't look directly at ronson but begins to take in the (few) details of the room for the first time.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i thought steve had talked to you?}
<C>__{ronson}
<D>__{oh, pardon me. i obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face value. no, you talk to me. but do me a favor? none of this demons crap.}
<A>__{kirsty closes her eyes, almost wincing, as memory comes. kirsty opens her eyes. consciously, she slows the rhythm of the dialogue down.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{he talked about demons, huh?}
<C>__{ronson}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{kirsty turns her head to look directly at ronson.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{it's true. all of it. it's all true.}
<A>__{ronson stares at her, impressed by her conviction and intensity. there is a second of shared silence. suddenly, a shocking electronic crackle shatters the mood. ronson starts, then realises it is the radio at his belt. he snatches it up and speaks into it.}
