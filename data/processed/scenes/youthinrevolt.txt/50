<A>__{nick slouches in a corner of the shop, his hands trembling as he brings his coffee to his lips. he hears the door open and looks up, but instead of the cops finds sheeni. she joins him at the table.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{should i go to the sheriff's now?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{no. i managed to convince mother you were retarded and couldn't read the sign.}
<A>__{nick nods thankfully.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{say, where were you anyway? we said five minutes to six.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{i'm sorry. but, nick, women are always discreetly late. it's expected of us.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{swell. and the punctual guy fries in the chair for rape.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{don't complain. at least you got to shower with a naked woman.}
<P>__{(licking donut powder off her fingers)}
<D>__{what are your plans today?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{my parents want to go to middletown. jerry has the moronic notion of buying a trailer there before we leave.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{i should like to come with you, nick. the more time we spend together the better. i fear when you leave we might never see each other again.}
<A>__{nick nods glumly. clearly a devastating thought.}
