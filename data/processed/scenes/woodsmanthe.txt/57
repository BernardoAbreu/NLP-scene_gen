<L>__{interior walter's apartment morning}
<A>__{walter sits at his window with his journal, watching outside. walter's pov: candy leans against his car, patiently waiting. something grabs candy's attention, and walter follows his gaze. kids pour off a school bus. candy waves to one angel faced boy of ten or eleven.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{so what should i do? call the cops?}
<P>__{(he laughs)}
<D>__{yeah, that's pretty funny.}
<A>__{the boy and a buddy run over to candy.}
<D>__{walter (v.0.) (cont'd) but what if candy seduces one to go for a ride?}
<A>__{candy smiles and offers angel face a candy bar, which the boy accepts.}
<D>__{walter (v.o.)(cont'd) yeah, that's right. if the boy goes for a ride it's because he wants to go for a ride.}
<A>__{the bell rings. the other boy grabs angel face, and they run off to school. walter rests his chin on his hands, watching.}
