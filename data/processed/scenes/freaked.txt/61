<L>__{exterior carnival tent}
<A>__{elijah, looking natty in his ringmaster suit, stands at the entrance, barking to various people who are drifting in.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{it's grisly! it's revolting! it'll make you wish you were dead! and at just twelve bucks a head, you can bring all the kids!}
<A>__{we follow a kindly father through the curtained entrance. oof! he collapses, a knife embedded in his chest, revealing the total mayhem...}
<B>__{inside the tent}
<A>__{the motley crowd (locals, sleazy looking mobsters, rogue bikers, wayward hippies, and japanese tourists, etc.) is brawling and drinking and having a heck of a time. some small displays and a few carnival booths are set up around the sides of the tent. there's a "petting zoo" where a kid is petting a two tailed no headed dog. and there's a "heavy petting zoo" where a guy is french kissing a six legged goat. a clown sits in a dunk tank, heckling the customers. the sign says "dunk me in acid!"}
<C>__{clown}
<D>__{c'mon, my granny could throw better than you!}
<A>__{he's talking to an old lady, who throws a baseball, hits the target, and dunks the clown into the foaming bath of carbolic acid. we hear his gurgling screams, then his bony hand reaches up out of the bath. elijah walks out on stage and looks at the rowdy audience. it's total mayhem.}
<C>__{elijah}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{quiet, please.}
<A>__{everyone instantly sits down, shuts up, and looks up obediently at elijah.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{thank you. ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness a cavalcade of atrocities so horrific, i advise the more sensitive members of our audience to leave the premises.}
<A>__{two sensitive looking men wearing sweaters draped over their shoulders politely get up and leave.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{tonight i'm proud to announce the addition of several new monstrosities to the show, including our star attraction, the beast boy an untamed and highly dangerous ghoul who's liable to go nuts and kill us all at the drop of a hat.}
<P>__{(impressed "oohs", "ahhs",}
<D>__{and "cools" from the}
<P>__{audience)}
<D>__{but first up, prepare to behold an unspeakably repulsive yet heartwarming atrocity, three men and a baby!}
<A>__{three men and a baby, all fused into a single multi limbed freak, walks out onstage. one of its arms holds up a dirty diaper, and all the three men hold their noses and grimace. the audience breaks into warm hearted laughter and applause.}
<C>__{backstage}
<A>__{the freaks mill around in the caged in green room, guarded by toad. frogman, dressed in a magician's outfit over his wetsuit, holds an empty dove cage and searches the room, whistling for his missing dove. nosey sneezes up a cloud of feathers. julieernie walk determinedly towards the adjacent men's and women's restrooms... bonk! they hit the wall between the two doors. rick is reading his "script", rehearsing his lines. he's wearing a cheesy "jungle" costume.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{arrrggg. i am beast boy. i will eat you. arrrghh.}
<P>__{(he throws down the script)}
<D>__{i can't do this shit!}
<A>__{he peers through the bars, scanning the audience for signs.of a rescue party.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{damn it! what's keeping those guys?}
<A>__{the worm creeps up behind rick.}
<C>__{worm}
<D>__{something's troubling you, my boy. what is it?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{well, let's see. i've been kidnapped, hideously disfigured, imprisoned with a bunch of mutant freaks, my rescue party is m.i.a., and this dialogue makes "hey dude three" read like "dr. zhivago."}
<C>__{worm}
<D>__{i think i know what you're going through. i too had an eating disorder. you see, i've always had a feverish obsession with pudding. and when i was a young lad...}
<A>__{rick groans and looks out at the audience.}

<A>__{onstage.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{and now a perennial favorite here at freakland, ladies and gentlemen. i know you'll all enjoy the musical stylings of rosie the pinhead.}
<A>__{rosie the pinhead struts out wearing a sexy dress and holding a microphone. after the applause dies down, she whips off her sunglasses with a flourish, revealing her extremely goofy looking crossed eyes. she wails incomprehensibly and bonks her head with the mic.}
<C>__{rosie}
<P>__{(drooling)}
<C>__{eeeeoooooooooooooiiiiieeeeee...}
