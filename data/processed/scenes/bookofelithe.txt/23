<L>__{interior palladium carnegie's bedroom day}
<A>__{this old second floor dressing room has been converted into a bedroom, simply furnished. a woman stands in front of an old dressing room mirror, the bulbs around the frame burned out and broken. she washes her face in murky water in an old porcelain bowl on the dresser. her name is claudia. early 30s, pretty. she gazes into the mirror as she dries her hands, but it's so cracked and warped it's near impossible to see a reflection. the door opens and carnegie enters. he still looks steamed. claudia doesn't turn to look at him, keeps facing the mirror.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{is that you, honey?}
<A>__{carnegie says nothing. just paces angrily up and down. finally claudia turns to face him.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{something wrong?}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{more books came in from the road today.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{oh? it's been a while.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{and it'll be a while longer. just another pile of useless junk. if we don't find the right one soon if i can't give these people what they want to hear...}
<A>__{carnegie trails off, the thought too awful to contemplate. claudia adopts a sympathetic expression, supportive.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you'll find what you're looking for. it's out there somewhere. you just have to have faith.}
<A>__{this seems to anger carnegie. he wheels on her.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{faith? is that what you think we're missing around here?}
<A>__{she detects the aggressive tone in his voice and goes quiet, head bowed. carnegie moves toward her angrily.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{my old man used to have faith. he had it in spades. my mother, too.}
<C>__{carnegie }
<D>__{you know where it got them? you know where it got me?}
<A>__{he's in her face now. claudia avoids eye contact, submissive.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{faith is for the weak. it's for them out there, the sheep. this world is what you can see and touch and taste. it's what you make it. all these years with me, you still don't have any grasp of that? what's wrong with you, woman?}
<A>__{he's shouting now, and she's trembling, afraid to speak.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{carnegie realizes he's frightened her. he softens.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{no, i'm sorry. i didn't mean to scare you. hey. you okay?}
<A>__{he lifts her chin up, wipes away a tear.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you just get me all riled up with that kind of talk. it's not what i need from you right now.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you know what i need right now?}
<A>__{he puts his hands on her lustfully. it's clear she's not in the mood, but she halfheartedly responds anyway. more out of a sense of wifely duty than reciprocated passion. as they kiss, carnegie pushes her excitedly against the wall and feverishly begins unbuckling his pants.}
