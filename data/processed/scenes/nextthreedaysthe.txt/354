<A>__{the room has two single beds. john waits at the bathroom door. lara steps out, a real awkwardness between them. she touches his hand. he offers a smile. she slips past him. he steps into the bathroom and closes the door. lara lies down on the single bed furthest from the bathroom, face to face with her sleeping son. without warning, he kisses her on the cheek, for the first time, without being prodded. he turns around and lets her wrap her arms around him. and she almost dies of happiness.}
