<L>__{interior abbott home tent night}
<A>__{the party is well underway, it's a younger crowd tonight. the band plays "fly me to the moon." doug stands apart from the others. he's ill at ease. his conversation with jacey resonates within him. as he looks over the gathering, he's pained to discover how easy it is to see things the way jacey does: lloyd holding court with a group of men in tuxedos... joan abbott propelling a reluctant alice towards a group of guests alice's age (alice and peter have separated)... and, finally, pamela dancing with a handsome young man (ted). she is the belle of the ball, radiant and suddenly mature in her beautiful gown. she smiles as she sees doug, excuses herself, and comes over to him.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{how long have you been here?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{a while.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i'm fine. having fun?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{yes, i am. come on, dance with me.}
<A>__{she pulls him towards the dance floor.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you didn't tell me i had to dance.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{just one dance and we'll be even. i won't have to be mad at you anymore and you won't have to be so sorry.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{what am i supposed to be so sorry about?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{oh, you're not sorry?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{all right, yeah, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{sorry about what?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you always do this to me.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{you said you weren't sorry and now you say you are. so maybe i'm not sure what you're sorry about?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i'm sorry for what i'm supposed to be sorry about. okay?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{you're sorry for feeling me up?}
<C>__{doug}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{oh, shit, come on, pam. dammit. for crying out loud. forget it.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i accept your apology. let's dance.}
<A>__{doug allows pam to pull him out onto the dance floor. he feels like a dolt, but she arranges his hands on her and they begin to dance. she gazes into his eyes and smiles:}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{pam is in love with doug, she has been since they were children. doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for her. for a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble of true affinity. but their bubble begins to deflate as doug sees joan abbott staring at them. her disapproval is unmistakable. doug steers pam around the dance floor to avoid joan's eyes, but then he sees lloyd abbott. lloyd's stare is even more discomforting. pamela senses the change in doug's mood, but she is unaware of the cause.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{is jacey home for the summer or is he just here for a visit?}
<A>__{the mention of his brother's name at this exact moment sends a chill down doug's spine.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{home for the summer.}
<P>__{(slight beat)}
<D>__{it's cheaper if he stays here for the summer. he can save more money for school, 'cause he doesn't have to pay rent. money's tight, you know, we're sort of poor.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{you're not poor, are you?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{hell you kidding? even with jacey working summers, my mom had to borrow against the house so he could go to penn. i don't know where the money'll come from for me to go to college.}
<A>__{doug sees joan abbott prompting ted to cut in on his dance with pamela. doug's bitterness swells.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i hear alice and peter are getting a divorce.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{they're just separated.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{what's the difference?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i don't know, you'll have to ask them.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{so, where's eleanor tonight?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{eleanor's... just not here.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{is she pregnant?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{no! who said that?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i don't know, everybody in town is saying something different she got knocked up, she ran away, your old man kicked her out. so, which is it?}
<A>__{ted steps over and taps doug on the shoulder.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{fuck off.}
<A>__{ted is taken aback. pamela's eyes fill with tears.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{why do you hate me so much?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{excuse me, asshole, but...}
<A>__{doug spins and slugs ted in the jaw sending him reeling into the other dancers. everyone pulls away from doug and pam. doug massages his fist and looks helplessly at pamela:}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i don't hate you.}
