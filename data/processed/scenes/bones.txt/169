<L>__{interior the necropolis continuous}
<A>__{a distorted m.c. escher like feel to the place. where up seems to be down, down up, and left is right. not helped by behind only lit by the eerie flickering gaseous lamps outside, and the moonlight falling through the skylight. then, slowly through the gloom, they begin to perceive that the walls are clotted and congealed, teratomic masses of distorted flesh; faces, limbs, eyes, mouths, all trapped all contorted in agony. at first they seem to be frozen in the walls, like the ruins of herculaneum. but then we see they are slowly writhing, moving. hands grasping, teeth and rotted jaws widening, and worst of all, the eyes staring out.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{is this hell?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(gripping the gun)}
<D>__{or just hell adjacent...}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{ain't no heaven. ain't no hell. there's just the world of the dead, my momma always talked about. like she said, the door is open, and we're seeing right through our world into this one. we just have to remember what was really here. and follow it. those stairs should take us to the second floor.}
<A>__{as they approach the stairs they can hear faintly above the drone moan of the dead, the soft music playing in bones' crib.}
<B>__{angle as}
<A>__{they start up the stairs into the darkness. patrick first, cinnabar in between him and bill. patrick still holding his flashlight, but it's starting to flicker a little. more of the same horror along the stairway walls, eyes looking at them, hands caress cinnabar's hair, another hand shooting up from the stair floor and grabbing bill's thigh. bill stabs the hand with the knife on his belt. and the hands shoot back down. back in bones' crib the munch like dance of death goes on, bones stroking the back of her neck.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{just like i told you this morning, i'd be stroking your neck tonight.}
<A>__{pearl absolutely lost.}
<B>__{back on the stairs}
<A>__{the three still ascending when patrick's flashlight suddenly cuts out. total darkness.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{a faint sound: patrick shaking the flashlight. nothing but the sound of breathing, both human and non human.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{thing worked fine a minute ago. batteries were brand new }
<A>__{then as suddenly as it went out, the flashlight comes back on, illuminating a horrible sight: maurice. standing right there, a few feet in front of them.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{maurice!}
<A>__{maurice puts a finger to his lips and beckons them to follow. the boys want it to be maurice. but cinnabar knows better.}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{that's not maurice }
<A>__{but with the beam of the flickering flashlight, they follow the shadowy figure up the steps. then maurice gets a bit to far ahead, and they can't see him for a beat.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{maurice. hold up, man.}
<A>__{then after a silent beat, just maurice's hand appears back out of the darkness, beckoning them onward. then the flashlight cuts out again. they're back in the darkness.}
<C>__{patrick }
<P>__{(as he shakes the flashlight)}
<D>__{okay, we're on the second floor. i feel it. no more steps.}
<A>__{the sound of patrick cursing and shaking the batteries around in the torch. eventually it comes on again. up ahead, they still barely see maurice, his back to them, face in one quarter profile, leading them towards the next flight of stairs at the end of the hall. they follow. closer and closer to the stairs, maurice going eerily in and out of their vision. the flashlight dies again. darkness. patrick shakes it and it comes back quickly. then just as quickly dies again! a shake and it's lit again just as bill is stepping into the corner where maurice disappeared.}
<B>__{flickering horror}
<A>__{as the dog leaps at them from the corner, all teeth and slavering jaws! everyone scrambles for their lives, and the flashlight falls to the floor. low angle from the floor just behind the flashlight we see the skewed horror: as the dog tears at bill, as his gun skitters across the floor; as patrick grabs the gun and fires, and we get a bit more illumination from the exploding gunpowder. but it does no good. bill screams in terror as he's torn to pieces, and then the flashlight goes out and again, we're in stygian darkness. the sound of bill dying and a long silence.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{bill?! cinnabar? cinnabar?!}
<A>__{no answer. at first. finally in husky voice:}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{i'm here.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{bill! bill?!}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{patrick, he's...}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{okay, okay. listen:}
<A>__{from somewhere comes the sound of the music from bones' crib.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{here, find my hand. the stairs are right near here. i saw them. let's just walk up there.}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{i can't find you.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{here!}
<A>__{silence. as we expect the worse, expect something else to take her hand. but then:}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{is that you?}
<A>__{pause the music from bones' crib still beckons to them.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{yeah. come on. don't let go.}
<A>__{we're in near total darkness as they climb the stairs, maybe a bit of moonlight now coming in from the roofless third floor they're approaching. all we can hear is their footsteps and their breathing as they walk the rest of the way up the stairs and emerge into: bones' crib their pov both amazed to see pearl as young and beautiful as cinnabar is, clinging to the dashing jimmy dancing to the spectral sounds of some soul classic from back in the day. cinnabar entranced by the vision.}
<B>__{angle as}
<A>__{pearl opens her dreaming eyes and sees them, smiling and beckoning cinnabar to come join her. cinnabar begins to. patrick watches her until he hears something o.s. calling to him. it sounds a million miles away and yet right in his ear. and it sounds like jeremiah.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{paaatrick...}
<A>__{patrick's pov he turns and looks at the wall subtly surging from beneath the surface of the wall he sees flashes of faces and hands, mouths twisted in torment. he moves to the wall, drawn by the strange sight and the recurring sound...}
<C>__{jeremiah }
<P>__{(as if a million miles away)}
<D>__{patrick. help me.}
<A>__{it's coming from within the wall.}
