<L>__{interior mens room night}
<A>__{scott stevens walks to the row of troughs and begins to urinate. the room is empty. he hears a noise and looks around. two eio men are standing there aiming lethal looking high velocity weapons at him. one of them is the red headed man we've already seen.}
<P>__{1st man (red headed)}
<D>__{well, look at that. he's really got his hands full. 2nd man not so full, so i've heard.}
<A>__{still urinating, the frustrated scott stevens can only look back over his shoulder. laughing, both men open fire, riddling him with bullets. he collapses in an undignified heap, his head in the water at the base of the trough.}
