<L>__{exterior hunter's hand and arm day}
<A>__{as the hunter leaps from the net his weapon activates, his arm slashing out, severing a thick limb of the spreading tree capony, entangled in vines.}
<L>__{exterior the team day}
<A>__{the limb crashes down from the trees, schaefer, dillon, billy and mac diving for safety. but ramirez, following the hunter's leap, sees too late the pendular movement of the severed limb and is struck a thudding blow in the ribs, which lifts him off his feet, hurling him backwards like a rag doll, his shirt torn open, exposing a bloody wound. as anna runs to ramirez's side the others, still stunned, look upward, frozen in shock seeing: the hunter, clinging to a side of a tree, flushed bright crimson. dillis is dumbfounded, like the others, rooted to the ground staring upward.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{what is god's name...?}
<A>__{the hunter utters an unearthly snarl and hiss from his open mouth as an instant later his camouflage resumes and he vanishes from sight...a rapid, furtive movement through the trees. mac opens fire with the m 60, the others joining in, shredding the foliage, but they know the creature is gone. with a shout, mac races into the jungle, in pursuit of the hunter.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{mac!}
<A>__{schaefer hurriedly ejects the spent clip from the m 203, slamming in a new one. he shouts an order to billy.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(to billy)}
<D>__{get ramirez on his feet! take the girl and get the hell out of here!}
<A>__{he turns to run after mac. dillon steps in front of him, putting his hand on schaefer's chest.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{no way, dutch. i'm going. you get these people and get the hell out of here.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{this isn't your style, dillon.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{guess i've picked up some bad habits from you, dutch. now don't argue with me, you know i'm right. get to that chopper and hold it for us. we'll be along.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{you know you can't win this one.}
<A>__{dillon stares at him.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{you know me, dutch, i never did know when to quit.}
<A>__{dillon turns and begins to move out.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{dillon!}
<A>__{dillon turns. picking up the spare mp 5, schaefer tosses the weapon to dillon, who grabs it with one hand. they share a look, knowing this is farewell.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{i will see you there.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{right behind you.}
<A>__{hefting both weapons at the hip he runs into the jungle after mac. schaefer watches him leave. he breaks and goes to ramirez, attended by anna and billy, who is now sitting up, holding his ribs and gasping for breath.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{he's busted up, bad, major.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(gasping)}
<D>__{i can make it, major.}
<A>__{schaefer lifts him to his feet, supporting him.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{come on, poncho, we're getting out of here.}
<P>__{(to billy)}
<D>__{billy, take the radio, leave the rest. come on!}
