<A>__{frank sees the car again, coming around the corner, walks briskly back to where ana waits. the car is almost upon them as he grabs her by the wrist and pulls her hard along the sidewalk. the car guns its engine as frank pushes in past the doors with ana, the windows explode. they dive to the floor, bullets ripping through the place. doc draws his two guns and fires back at the car, hitting it a couple times as it screeches off. he gathers ana and frank off the floor like a presidential bodyguard, hustles them out to the car. frank's shoulder is bleeding.}
