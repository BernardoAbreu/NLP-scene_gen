<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior katherine's classroom building day}
<A>__{it's lunch break. most of the students sit in loose cliques around the front of the building; eating, skipping rope, picking fights.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{the recently unearthed skull sits on katherine's desk. feet up beside it, she leans back in her chair looking through a dinosaur book. one of her students, a twelve year old boy, finishes cleaning up the floor and stands beside her.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{i'm all done with the cleaning, miss henley.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{thank you, jason. i appreciate it.}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(looking at book over her shoulder)}
<D>__{find out what it is, yet?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{well, it's either a 44 million year old strychtosaurus or that cow mr. sorenson lost last winter.}
<A>__{the boy, still standing beside her, begins to look nervous. slowly, he lets his weight rest against katherine's shoulder. she smiles good naturedly up at him.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{go eat your lunch, jason.}
<A>__{the boy immediately stiffens and begins backing up, almost relieved.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{sure, miss henley. thanks. see ya.}
<A>__{katherine watches him leave, smiles again, and goes back to the book.}
<B>__{around the back of the building}
<A>__{on the abandoned back stairs, a couple of mexican boys sit smoking cigarettes. they whistle and kid with the four young girls that pass them going up the steps.}
<B>__{upstairs}
<A>__{is the abandoned, decayed part of the building. the four girls know they're not supposed to be here and that's probably half the fun. they run through the crumbling halls, giggling and hiding from one another. their cries, the smack of their shoes, echo off off the peeling halls. one of them is mary, running down a hall, banging a stick with another girl. at a corner mary peels off from her friend, runs down a new hall, turns a corner, and comes on simon. he's still curled where we last saw him, in the wall niche where some lockers used to be. the two stare at one another. finally,}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{simon.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you don't look so good, simon.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no, i don't.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm mary.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{hello mary.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{does miss henley know you're here?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no one does, mary. can we keep it just our secret. for a little while?}
<A>__{mary thinks.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{you can hear her friends coming closer.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i have to go.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{it was nice meeting you, mary.}
<A>__{mary goes to leave, stops, turns back.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{are you hungry? i could bring something.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{that would be very nice.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{okay. bye.}
<A>__{she smiles and runs down the hall. simon grits his teeth, turns to the wall, and prepares himself for a long, long day.}
