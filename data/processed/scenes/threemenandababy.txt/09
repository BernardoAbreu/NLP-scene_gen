<A>__{jack is in the cockpit with his copilot, ron. the engines are revving. jack is checking gauges. he looks out the window idly and sees: the crew of another plane walking across the tarmac. paul is one of the crew. paul sees jack and begins to gesture wildly, but his voice is drowned out by the noise of the engines. just seeing paul is enough to remind jack about his package.}
