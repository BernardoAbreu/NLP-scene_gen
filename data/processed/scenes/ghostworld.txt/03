<L>__{exterior high school auditorium late afternoon}
<A>__{the auditorium door opens and graduates emerge. enid & rebecca run away from the crowd, triumphantly holding rolled up diplomas. they run toward the school playground, nearly bursting with excitement over their long awaited release. enid stops and looks back at the school. she gives it the finger. they sit on a see saw, out of breath.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{god, what a bunch of retards...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i thought chipmunk face was never going to shut up.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i know, i liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! she gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's little miss perfect and everybody loves her.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{it's totally sickening.}
<P>__{(she unrolls her diploma)}
<D>__{let's see if they gave me the right diploma...}
<A>__{enid opens hers. instead of a diploma, it's an official looking document with a pink post it note on the front page.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what?... oh suck my fucking dick!}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{these assholes are saying that i have to go to summer school and take some stupid art class!}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? i didn't think that just because you get an "f" that means you have to take the class over again.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{you loser.}
