<A>__{a full moon, backlit clouds rolling through the skies, reflected in the water below. pi floats behind the lifeboat, weeping, surrounded by nothing but terror and the abyss. a thick range of clouds moves in, threatening to cut off the light from the moon and stars. pi watches richard parker on the lifeboat, a shadowy silhouette on the bow ahead. the tiger takes the zebra carcass under the tarp. the clouds blot out the sky. darkness envelops them.}
