<A>__{full shot. in the f.g. a smallish crowd, mostly men and children idle in the street in front of mary wells' gambling and dance hall. the wooden sidewalk is cluttered with those articles belonging to the women that were too bulky to get into the surrey. several women stand on the porch supervising the locking up of the place and the removal of the sign of mary wells' name on it. graham's buckboard rounds a corner at a fast trot. he slows the team to let the people get out of the way.}
<B>__{med. shot on buckboard}
<A>__{the team has slowed to a walk. the people give their attention to the buckboard. a boy clambers up over the tailboard, sees the cargo and jumps off with a frightened yell. the crowd turns from the dance hall and follows the buckboard leaving the women and their pious male assistants on the porch.}
