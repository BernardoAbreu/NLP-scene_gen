<L>__{2nd stickman}
<A>__{glances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his buttons. closer angle the crystals, stickman sucked up into the machine as it hovers. as the floor is once again bare, the 2nd stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and away.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as the stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd beginning to pour out of carousel. logan and francis arcade descending from the top level not much of a crowd. francis is gesturing toward the hallucimill.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{...well i think you're getting stale. you need old lucey go on. gee the whole burn try the new psycho lift they tell me it turns you inside out...}
<A>__{he shoves logan in that direction and continues on down.}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(calling after him)}
<D>__{i will look for you here when i'm off }
<A>__{and he is gone.}
<B>__{logan}
<A>__{waves, smiling, then turns to the hallucimill. pov hallucimill exterior crazy, man.}
<B>__{back to logan}
<A>__{hesitates, as a couple push past him gleefully on their way. he looks and we see: pov arcade, upper levels the people from carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready for more fun.}
<B>__{logan}
<A>__{not with it. he turns and starts making his way downwards towards the exit. logan's apartment as he enters. idle, restless. he crosses to a sideboard makes himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. gets rid of it, makes another. he fiddles with things, a game sits, gets up. now he is beginning to feel the drink. takes another belt, smiles. now he goes over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.}
<B>__{at the wall recess}
<A>__{as logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess a slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. he tunes it in and the figure of a smiling young man appears bejeweled, lustrous, willing.}
<B>__{logan at the console}
<A>__{bored as mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man dissolves. he dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes shape. it is jessica.}
<B>__{jessica and logan}
<A>__{still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile. around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. it catches logan's eye. he smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. he reaches out a hand and leads her out into the room.}
<B>__{logan and jessica}
<A>__{as jessica turns to him, logan moves in strongly and embraces her but, to his surprise, she resists. logan, still holding her loosely, is amused and surprised.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{what's wrong, available?}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(breaking away gently)}
<D>__{please . . .no.}
<A>__{she backs away, almost apologetically. logan follows, smiling.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{please . . . no ?}
<P>__{(noting that she looks trapped, he understands)}
<D>__{you mean "not here" that's it? you're a private available but particular,}
<P>__{(he is moving in on her}
<D>__{as he speaks, she retreating,}
<P>__{which amuses him)}
<D>__{don't worry. there's no one here but me. and you.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(that stops him)}
<D>__{just no.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{you prefer women?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{well then...?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{nothing. i felt sad, i put myself on the circuit. it was a mistake.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{sad? what made you sad?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{a friend of mine went on carousel tonight. now he's gone.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{yes...probably he was renewed?}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{he was killed}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{killed? why do you use that word?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{isn't it right? isn't that what you do? kill.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{i never 'killed' anybody in my life. sandmen terminate runners}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{who brought you?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{nobody. i felt sad. .. i put myself on the circuit.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{you felt sad. what's your name?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{jessica.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{you're beautiful. let's have sex.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{later.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{but you put yourself on the circuit!}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{i thought i had to do something.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{i changed my mind}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{and now?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{curious.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{how a sandman lives.}
<A>__{logan smiles, takes off gunbelt, etc.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{let's have sex.}
<P>__{(as jessica shakes her head)}
<D>__{i thought you were curious.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{not about that.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{i'm listening.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{i'm afraid to tell you.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i'm not armed.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{why is it wrong to run?}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{you shouldn't even think such things...}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{and you picked a strange person to say them to }
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{i suppose. but what if you want to live?}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{so? do what everyone does. try like hell for renewal.}
<A>__{logan stretches out his right hand. we see a red flower crystal embedded and centered in his right palm. it is exactly the same shape that we have seen in black in the palm of the dead runner.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{when this turns black...that's it.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{if for any reason you want to be 31... you have the same chance as everyone else...carrousel.}
<A>__{logan takes his gun and points it at her.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(playfully)}
<D>__{but if you're one of the misfits... that's where i come in.}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(somewhat frightened)}
<D>__{i didn't say that i would run... i just...}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(interrupting; turning over her palm)}
<D>__{are you a 5 or a 6?}
<P>__{(we see a green crystal)}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{six. i go red next year.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{you're years away . . . i don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.}
<P>__{(offering jessica the gun)}
<D>__{want to try?}
<A>__{jessica shakes her head. logan looks at jessica carefully...in an admiring sexual way...from her toes to her head...briefly noticing (in the process) chat she is wearing an identical piece of jewelry that he has taken off the dead runner...around her neck.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{what quad do you live in?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{k.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you're sure you don't want to try?}
<A>__{jessica nods.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{it's nice to know you can nod.}
<A>__{jessica smiles.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{it's nice co know you can do that, too.}
<A>__{suddenly francis and two dishevel led young women burst in and come laughing toward logan and jessica stoned, hilarious, they crowd around logan one of them embracing him. in the wild hilarity, jessica slips away and logan, seeing her go, makes a vain effort after her. francis notices, laughs. amid the noise he shouts to logan:}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{these are for me you've got your own.}
<P>__{(looking after jessica)}
<D>__{she must have been something ?}
<A>__{at logan's expression he roars with laughter francis picks up an atomizer and hurls it at the ceiling where it shatters and a great pink cloud settles over them all.}
