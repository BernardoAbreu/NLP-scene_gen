<A>__{a sequence begins showing charlotte and wills during a day of holiday shopping. the deep snow has slowed the city to a crawl but filled everyone with good spirits. charlotte and wills move from store to store; they buy wreaths, garlands, ornaments, candles, and, finally, a christmas tree and stand. wills starts to lug the tree, but when it's obvious that it's too much for him, charlotte spots a group of kids spilling out of a record store. the next thing we know the kids are lined up, carrying the tree over their heads like a battalion of ants. wills and the kids load the tree into the freight elevator and squeeze in. there's no room for charlotte. she'll take the lobby elevator.}
