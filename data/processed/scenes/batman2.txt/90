<L>__{interior penguin's aviary night}
<A>__{a canary sings in its cage as a black cat watches transfixed from a nearby chair. the cat arches its back waits and springs at the cage, batting at it in midair. the canary shrieks; the cat yowls; a woman snatches it up off the floor, cradles it in her arms...}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{now hecate. you don't want that scrawny little bird }
<A>__{it's selina, looking ripe and slinky in a sheer black ensemble. at the desk behind her is the penguin, in his customary cutaway and waist coat, polishing his new raven. he bares his teeth:}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{do you want me to wring that creature's neck?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{you try it, i will do the same to you.}
<P>__{(as he grumbles; bemused)}
<D>__{i saw him, you know.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{saw who?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{batman. he was dreamy.}
<A>__{she strokes the cat, in a reverie. the penguin drops his polishing cloth, startled.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{dreamy?!? are you insane!? my god }
<P>__{(sputtering wildly)}
<D>__{are you sure it was him? what did he do?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{he stood on a roof and watched me. he didn't realize i'd seen him. i don't think he knew quite what to make of me.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{but he was definitely interested.}
<A>__{this sends the penguin into a frantic round of pacing. (or waddling.)}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{this scheme of yours is backfiring. we don't need him on our tails. do you know how much money is at stake here?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{money isn't everything.}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{what's the point if we can't enjoy ourselves?}
<A>__{she chuckles to herself. he stares at her in disbelief and}
<B>__{squawks.}
