<A>__{the hall. deer heads. boar heads. portraits of ancestors.}
<C>__{old woman}

<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i may meet my maker soon from lack of sustenance. but for now i am real enough.}

<C>__{robin}
<D>__{by heaven, am i to dance next? who are you?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i am the maid marian.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{then show yourself, child. for we knew each other well.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{with the king away, these are lawless times. there are outlaws villainous enough to kidnap and ransom a relative of his.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you know i am not one of them. besides, i am sworn to protect you.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{protect me? robin of locksley was nothing but a spoiled bully.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{allow that years of war and prison may change a man. step forward, marian, so i may see how you have changed.}
<A>__{she moves into the light... fat. rotten teeth. ugly as sin.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{er... the years have been kind.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{thank you. now remove yourself from this household.}
<A>__{a figure steps behind robin. sticks a sword in his back.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(turning away)}
<D>__{as you can see, we are already well protected.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{wait, marian! ...ouch!}
<A>__{the sword is jabbed into his back. robins faces the man clad in back, with a metal fighting mask.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you are truly courageous against an unarmed man.}
<A>__{the figure gestures towards the door. robin sidesteps. slams an elbow. the sword drops. slides across the floor. robin moves for it, but the man intercepts, drawing a dagger. robin darts to the wall. rips off an antlered deer head. defends himself as the attacker slashes at the horns.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{the sound of the fight indoors. aslan hurls himself at the door. it doesn't give.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{chunks of horn fly. robin parries and thrusts. the horns get shorter. robin retreats. left with just the nubs, robin hurls the deer head at the mask. gaining advantage, he charges. grabs the dagger hand, smashes it into the wall. the knife drops. robin wrenches off the mask. long hair tumbles down... a beautiful young woman. the front door caves in. aslan stumbles through... just in time to see the woman's knee fly up into robin's crotch. robin folds. the battle is over. the young woman stands over robin.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{as she was saying, we have no need of your protection.}
<A>__{robin croaks through clenched teeth.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{marian.}
