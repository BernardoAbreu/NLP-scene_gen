<A>__{epps steps from a passageway into a large public room. tables and chairs are scattered haphazardly, light falling in from windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang. she walks on. a pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry decanter beside them. an ashtray sits beside that. epps stops, reaching down. she pulls back a half smoked cigarette, lipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time. and, as she stands there, we see a figure, in murky silhouette, move past the doorway in the background. in an instant it is there and gone. she puts down the cigarette, having sensed a presence. she turns to the doorway across the room, but there is nothing to be seen now.}
