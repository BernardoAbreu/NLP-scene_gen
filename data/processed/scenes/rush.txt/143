<D>__{niki?}
<A>__{niki turns round. james sets eyes on him for the first time. james reels, visibly horrified by his appearance. his bandages are blood stained. he has no hair. looks grotesque.. niki sees the horror in james's face. sees the shock. the horror. and recognizes in that moment, this is how it's going to be this is how people will respond to him forever.}

<D>__{trust me, watching you win those points and all those races while i was in hospital fighting for my life...you were equally responsible for getting me better.}
<A>__{ouch. that could have been meant generously. but in this case it wasn't. it was a cold slap in the face. niki turns and goes.}
