<L>__{exterior pham van's store roof day}
<A>__{val earl and miguel listen in disbelief to the distant truck alarm. it finally sputters and dies.}
<C>__{heather }
<D>__{val, we're going to have to forget about the truck...}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(into cb)}
<D>__{yeah, heather, we got you.}
<A>__{they've hit rock bottom. they sit in helpless, desperate silence. over on the storage shed roof, melvin is losing it:}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{hey, you better think of something , man! you gotta do something!}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{you and val, man!}
<A>__{miguel nods in agreement. val and earl stare at him, incredulous.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{what?!! since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!}
<C>__{rhonda}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{you guys do all the odd jobs.}
<A>__{val just stares at her. then crash! the store shudders, creaks, and groans. the creatures are back. one corner of the store lifts up, beams splintering. then another corner lifts up! the roof tilts like the deck of a storm tossed ship. from now on the monsters shake and ram the building almost constantly. hanging on tight, the men peer over the edge.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{we don't have a hell of a lot of time here.}
<A>__{meanwhile, rhonda tries her desperate best to be logical:}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{look, the situation hasn't changed. we still have to get to solid rock. there must be some way!}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(shouts, angry)}
<D>__{like what ?! there's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{hey, val, quiet, man!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{we need a helicopter is what we need, or a goddamn tank...}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{wait a minute...the cat. could we take the cat?}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(dubious)}
<D>__{jesus. it's slower than hell.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons. no way they could stop it.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{we can't all fit on that bulldozer.}
<A>__{but val is warming to the idea.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{but...we could pull something! we could, i don't know, drag a car behind it!}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{a car, huh? like a big armored car? need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{its tires are flat...}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{doesn't matter. the cat can pull any thing.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{well...all right ! we just roll on out of here!}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{we got a plan!}
<A>__{they squint at the bulldozer ' way in the distance.}
<C>__{earl }
<D>__{'course, that's one helluva long walk.}
<A>__{they stare grimly, momentarily stuck for an idea. then:}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{listen, they only respond to vibration, right? couldn't we... distract them somehow?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{yeah, good! something to keep them busy. we need a decoy.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{hey, melvin, you wanna make a buck?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{miguel grabs earl and points down at little garden tractor in a jumble of pham van's equipment and tools near the side of the store.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{hey, how about the tractor? start him up. let him go by itself. let those things chase it all over is they like that noise.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{not bad.}
<P>__{(to val)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{the store takes a heavy hit. the front porch collapses with a terrific crash.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{i think the ground's getting closer. i think we do it. we're gonna save our asses here!}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{wait! how are you going to know they're all following it?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{good pointerior}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{we got two right here.}
<A>__{val scrambles to the highest point of the sagging roof and shouts to nancy.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{nancy, we gotta find all four of them. how many you got over there?}
