<A>__{morticia is now stretched out on the torture rack. fester and tully are securing her hands and feet, under abigail's supervision. fester seems torn, agitated, upset.}
<C>__{morticia}
<P>__{(to abigail, graciously)}
<D>__{you are a desperate woman, consumed by greed and infinite bitterness.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{we could have been such friends.}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{i don't think so. the vault, mrs. addams any thoughts?}
<C>__{morticia}
<P>__{(sweetly, to abigail)}
<D>__{despite everything, i don't hate you. i pity you. persecution, fiendish torture, inhuman depravity sometimes it's just not enough.}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{gordon let's get started.}
<C>__{fester}
<D>__{but, mother...}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{stop stalling!}
<C>__{fester}
<D>__{i'm not stalling! stop badgering me!}
<C>__{abigail}
<P>__{(pushing fester aside)}
<D>__{tully, take over! tighten it!}
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{i'd love to, you know that, but i've got this stomach thing. when i torture people. it's just me.}

<C>__{tully}
<P>__{(to morticia, politely)}
<D>__{where's your bathroom?}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{tully shuts his eyes and tightens the rack. morticia's bones make a horrible popping, stretching sound. she moans, rather sensually.}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{again!}
<A>__{tully tightens the rack again. more bone popping noises. morticia moans again, even more orgasmically.}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{tighter!}
<A>__{tully tightens the rack a third time. bone popping noises. morticia moans, very voluptuously. she opens her eyes. she sighs, in afterglow. she glances at tully.}
<C>__{morticia}
<P>__{(to tully, flirtatiously)}
<D>__{you've done this before.}
