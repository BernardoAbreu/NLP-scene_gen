<L>__{interior copter day}
<A>__{a one man light spotter; the space next to the pilot cluttered with tools and floats, lashed in place. below, seen through the plastic bubble, the raft growing larger as the chopper sets down.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{air one to base. i have a positive location on that sailing party. disabled and adrift...}
<P>__{(he checks chart on his knee board)}
<D>__{...about 3 4 miles west of cable junction, wind and current carrying them just about due east. i count ten juveniles.}
<B>__{the raft}
<A>__{the helicopter is creating a lot of turbulence as it sets down, a huge circular pattern of prop wash on the surface as the rotors slow to a halt. the kids are waving and jubilant.}
<B>__{angle on the copter}
<A>__{as the pilot unbuckles, opens the door, and steps out on one pontoon; he speaks through a bullhorn.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{everyone okay? any injuries?}
<A>__{the kids ad lib in the affirmative.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{can you put us on cable junction?}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{i got no room for passengers.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{how about a tow? can you rig that?}
<A>__{the pilot nods. larry heaves a line to him, the pilot catches it and makes it fast to a convenient tie off on the undercarriage.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{as soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in. my dad's the mayor...}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{there's a shark...}
<A>__{the other kids all chime in, adding their ad lib shouts describing what happened, calling for help, etc. it's all a noisy jumble, the pilot ignores it, trying to do his job.}
<B>__{angle on the raft}
<A>__{the kids all shouting at once; jackie is screaming.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you have to take us off! you have to! why don't you take us!}
<C>__{doug}
<P>__{(calming her)}
<D>__{it's an observation spotter, he doesn't have the room...}
<B>__{angle on the pilot}
<A>__{he finishes tying off, and yells through his bullhorn at the kids.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{listen. i'm going to give you an assist to get you on cable junction. then i will call in, and get the coast guard to send a cutter. hang on to something.}
<A>__{he climbs into his bubble, shuts the door, gives the kids a "thumbs up," and starts the engine. quick cuts raft and chopper engine turning over. a line tied off to one of the ringbolts on an overturned hull; it pulls taut out of the water.}
