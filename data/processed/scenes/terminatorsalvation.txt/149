<A>__{a moment's breather. marcus slows the vehicle, which wobbles and smokes from all it's been through. he looks around.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{where are we going?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{he points toward the coast, we see a marina in the distance, a boat moored at a dock. marcus steers the atv down a slope toward the shoreline.}
<L>__{exterior coastline dock night dawn}
<A>__{marcus, kyle and star leap off the atv and sprint for a motorboat. kyle carries the rifle now. as they near the boat, marcus reacts to the sight of red eyes flickering in the darkness at the end of the dock, the blue glow of a rifle charging. marcus leaps in front of kyle and star shielding them with his body. the plasma blast envelops him, marcus is blown into the water. kyle and star are flattened by the force of the blast, lie motionless on the dock. their plasma rifle lies a few feet away. the skeletal terminator who shot marcus moves swiftly down the dock, its plasma rifle trained on the water now. it moves past kyle and star, who remain motionless on the ground, and goes to the edge of the dock blam! star snatches up their own plasma weapon, and blasts the thing in the back, knocking it into the water, which is only a few feet deep here. as it rises, she fires again, taking the terminator's head off. it goes under. the sky is beginning to lighten now as, a moment later, marcus emerges. as he climbs from the shallow water back onto the dock, kyle and star stare at him with astonishment. seeing their expressions, he checks himself for damage there's metal exposed at his shoulder, arm and hand, his face partially torn away, one eye missing. he tries to speak, but can only manage an electronic croak. kyle and star back away from him.}

<D>__{he's not real.}
<A>__{marcus shakes his head, starts to move toward them. star raises the rifle, points it at him.}
<C>__{star}
<D>__{don't come any closer!}
<A>__{they hear a whistling sound from shore, hit the deck as a missile blast takes out the boat and a large chunk of}
<B>__{dock.}
<A>__{laying low, they look up to see a small army of tanks and terminators approaching... even a hunter killer moving in from the horizon, swinging its spotlight in all directions. it looks like the last stand. marcus turns back to kyle and star. his voice is a distorted}
<B>__{whisper.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{star puts the rifle aside, with an apologetic expression. she moves to marcus, gingerly touches his exposed metal then hugs him tightly. kyle, more stoical, looks out to sea. his expression changes, becomes almost hopeful as in the distance, a huge, black shape rises to the surface of the water, just visible against the dawn horizon. fireworks! missiles blast the h k... napalm erupts around the tanks and terminator army as a squad of a 10s scream in from over the land, firing cannons, launching air to ground missiles to take out the tanks. one a 10 flies low overhead and wags its wings.}
