<L>__{exterior tower block. day.}
<A>__{jamal is riding the construction lift to the top of a high building, still just a shell but buzzing with carpenters, bricklayers, cable layers. the lift stops at the top. jamal gets out. looks around. he is miles up. alone.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{jamal!}
<A>__{jamal looks around. there is salim standing on the edge of the building. he saunters over to jamal, his arms outstretched in theatrical greeting. he is groomed, expensively dressed with the best mobile money can buy dangling from a gold chain around his neck.}
<C>__{salim }
<D>__{god is good, bhai. god is good.}
<A>__{he tries to embrace jamal. with as much force as he can muster, jamal punches him in the face. salim takes it. stands there. wipes blood from his lip. gets another punch. then another and another, not even defending himself, until he is being beaten back by a raging jamal towards the edge of the building. finally, he tries to reason with jamal}
<C>__{salim }
<D>__{maman's boys were after us. had to skip.}
<A>__{jamal keeps on beating him back.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{liar.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{left a message at reception. waited weeks for you in nagpur.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{there was no message at reception.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{bhai, i left a message.}
<A>__{salim opens his arms, defenceless. it would take one, small push to send him over the edge. there is a moment, when jamal might. he even has his hands on his chest.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{i will never forgive you.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{the fury in jamal subsides minutely. finally, he turns away with a roar of frustration. salim hangs his head.}
