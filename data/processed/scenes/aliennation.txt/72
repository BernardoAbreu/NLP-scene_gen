<L>__{interior backstage night}
<A>__{she moves along the narrow corridor.}
<C>__{cassandra}
<D>__{he's not here. why ask me?}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{the young woman at the front said you might know where he is.}
<C>__{cassandra}
<D>__{she did, did she? well, she was wrong. excuse me, i have to change.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{no problem.}
<A>__{she moves through a door. sykes follows closely so does jetson.}
<L>__{interior encounters dressing room night}
<A>__{cassandra grabs some clothes and goes into a stall.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{look, we're not here doing an interview for the school paper. this is a homicide investigation... and if you don't stop jerkin' us around, i'm ready to start playin' hardball.}
<A>__{jetson has waited politely half in half out of the room. sykes rapidly motions to him to "go look around". jetson mimes back, "huh?"}
<C>__{cassandra}
<P>__{(slipping out of her dance costume)}
<D>__{oooh. hardball. that sounds interesting. are you going to strike me? you could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... i've got my own ropes.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(still miming to jetson)}
<D>__{does that cost extra or you throw them in?}
<C>__{cassandra}
<D>__{you've got me all wrong. i don't charge money for something that i myself find pleasurable...}
<A>__{finally jetson gets what sykes is trying to tell him. he says in the uncertain, stagy voice of a bad liar:}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{i am going out to the car. i will meet you there.}
<A>__{sykes rolls his eyes as jetson exits into the corridor. cassandra emerges from the stall, wearing a long, stylish, low cut dress.}
<C>__{cassandra}
<D>__{look, i don't know where mr. strader might be. he comes and he goes.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(starting to feel a little uncomfortable)}
<D>__{the girl out front mentioned strader's assistant, somebody named watson. maybe he knows.}
<C>__{cassandra}
<P>__{(tensing slightly)}
<D>__{todd? todd doesn't know either.}
<A>__{she is very close to sykes now. she fingers the lapel of his jacket.}
<C>__{cassandra}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i know... why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? it's matt, right? now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{not unless i got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.}
<C>__{cassandra}
<D>__{a virgin. i find that very arousing...}
