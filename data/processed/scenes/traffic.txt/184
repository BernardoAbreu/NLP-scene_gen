<A>__{the office hasn't been decorated yet.}
<C>__{salazar}
<D>__{i've been too busy to completely settle in.}
<A>__{salazar proffers a chair and they sit next to each other like brezhnev and nixon. photographers begin snapping pictures. after a few moments, salazar waves them away, and they lower their cameras and leave.}

<D>__{you've been making very good progress against the tijuana cartel.}
<C>__{salazar}
<D>__{yes, i am confident that juan obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year. but, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force. we get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.}
<C>__{salazar}
<D>__{yes, i hope so as well.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{let me ask you a related question. we've talked about the supply side, but what about demand? what is your policy for treating addiction?}
<C>__{salazar}
<D>__{addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.}
<A>__{robert cannot respond.}
