<L>__{interior bookstore night}
<A>__{joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop. it's a jarring transition, visually and emotionally. joel is in the midst of some traumatic state of mind. he fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches clementine stack books on shelves. her hair is bright orange now.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i should maybe talk to you. voice over clementine. i should just maybe talk to her.}
<A>__{joel rises and heads toward clementine.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i love you and if you knew that... if i told you what happened... i will explain everything, what we meant to each other. i will tell you everything about our time together. you'll know everything again and... voice over maybe if i just explain what happened, i wouldn't have to go through this and i could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...}
<A>__{right before joel gets there, patrick, a skinny young man approaches clementine. joel stops, watches. the young man seems out of breath. he glances over at joel, then taps clementine on the shoulder. she turns, annoyed, sees who it is and her face lights up.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{clementine. voice over that's your look for me.}
<A>__{clementine giggles, stands and pokes patrick playfully in the ribs.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i just thought i'd say hi. i was in the neighborhood.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{you were not.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i was not.}
<A>__{joel is mesmerized by their familiarity. as he stands there, the scene starts to dry out. clementine and patrick continue their flirtation but it's turning lifeless, as if they are just reciting lines. the bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{come over after i'm done here?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i can't. i want to, but i have to study.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{you rat.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i really want to, but tonight's important. test tomorrow.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{how could she have done this to me? how could anyone do this to anyone?}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(to patrick)}
<D>__{you didn't say anything about my hair.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{it's so cool. you're by far the most sensational person in the room.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{in the room?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{in the world.}
<A>__{joel seems dazed, in some sort of dream confusion, as he realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{what's happening here?}
<P>__{(looks at watch; it's 9:30)}
<D>__{oh, god! i have to go home. they'll be there soon.}
<A>__{joel turns to leave.}
