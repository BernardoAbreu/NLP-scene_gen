<A>__{a cheap coffee shop a half flight down from the street. we are looking across an elbow of the coffee shop counter. in the middle b.g., norville sits dejectedly stirring a cup of coffee. behind him, through the window wells, we see the back and forth feet of pedestrians bustling by on the sidewalk. in the extreme f.g. sit two steaming mugs of coffee. they belong to two veterans of the coffee shop, who, from o.s., narrate the scene.}

<D>__{the mark notices.}
<A>__{beat. norville, however, is not noticing: he is staring intently at his coffee spoon, his hat pushed back on his head, his other hand propping up a cheekbone; the woman's presence does not seem to have registered yet.}

<D>__{she is!}
<A>__{and indeed she does: faint dead away, falling backwards on the stool, so that norville has no choice but to catch her. norville holds her awkwardly, looking around for help.}
<P>__{veteran #1 (o.s.)}

<D>__{she's damn good, lou.}
<A>__{a waitress enters extreme f.g. to block our view of the swooned woman and the embarrassed norville. the waitress is facing the camera and the two o.s. veterans; the cropping gives us only her torso and the steaming pot of coffee she holds.}
