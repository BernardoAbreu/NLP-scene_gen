<L>__{interior helen's living room day}
<A>__{helen, now wearing slippers and shorts with the same t shirts she slept in, is standing behind the living room curtains looking down at the street. she hears a code knock, then a key turns in the lock. she moves to greet andy her assistant and friend. andy is laden down with groceries and mail. helen immediately reaches a hand up to touch his face...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{where were you? don't tell me. it's just under seventy, right? the sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{would you please get your hands off my face, tallulah? what happened to the newspaper?}
<A>__{he withdraws a popsicle from the bag, offers it to her. when she rejects it, he takes it for himself.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i got it myself... i couldn't wait.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{well! aren't we the daring one? what's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make doctor helen set foot outside her door? the antenna is gone off her car again. i had no music, all the way to the market. let me find a garage for it?}
<A>__{they're in the kitchen area; andy unpacking stuff... expensive goodies...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i've told you: i can't afford to garage it.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{are you kidding? you buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which rots ... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i had the dream again.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i got another call. this time he spoke. he said "you and me, you and me."}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{a little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.}
<A>__{forget it.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he whispered, but it was him ! i know it was him!}
<A>__{andy now stops to address this seriously...}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{he can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you. did you give him an approval?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{andy? when a three year old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'. you look under the bad.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm three years old. call the prison.}
<A>__{her fear is so palpable, she is so nakedly vulnerable it breaks his heart. he puts his arms around her.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh god. i'm really crazy.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{when was the last time you washed your hair?}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(shaky, but trying)}
<D>__{monsieur andy, disapproves of my coiffure?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{monsieur andy can smell your coiffure. and guess what else?}
<A>__{he pats her thighs... she walks to the window as he talks...}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{cellulite. what do you say i blindfold you and take you to the gym. aerobics with housewives...}
<B>__{helen at window}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{andy?}
<A>__{andy has heard this tone before: panic attack alert.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{here we go again.}
<B>__{angle at window to include their pov of street}
<A>__{in a parked car a man is reading a newspaper that hides his face. behind him is parked a slightly beat up red saab.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you parked right behind him. the one i noticed earlier. i didn't say anything, i thought he'd leave. just take a look.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{oh my god! help! he's reading a newspaper!}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{but earlier, he was staring up here.}
<A>__{please , andy.}
<C>__{andy}
