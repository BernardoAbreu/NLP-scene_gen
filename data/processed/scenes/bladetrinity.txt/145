<L>__{interior blood farming facility main room night}
<A>__{blade, abigail, and vreede emerge into a cavernous room.}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{god in heaven }
<B>__{hundreds of human cadavers}
<A>__{hang from gantries, preserved in fluid filled pods, suspended by wires like nightmarish marionettes. the bodies are hooked up to an elaborate system of biosensor feeds and ivs which are designed to replenish vital nutrients.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{what was this place?}
<A>__{vreede pauses before answering, looking uncomfortable.}
<C>__{vreede}
<D>__{it's a blood farming facility.}
<P>__{(elaborating)}
<D>__{they decided that hunting humans on a piece meal basis was too inefficient. why kill your prey when you can keep them alive? productive. under optimal conditions a donor can generate anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints of blood a year.}
<C>__{abigail}
<P>__{(sickened)}
<D>__{but where did you get all these people?}
<C>__{vreede}
<D>__{the streets. in any given year you've got two to three million homeless people wandering around america }
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{no one cares about them. we're doing the country a service, really.}
<A>__{blade shakes his head, admiring the horrible efficiency.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{the vampire final solution.}
<A>__{abigail moves towards one of the pods, touching her hand to the glass, studyihg the comatose person within.}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{are they aware? do they feel anything?}
<C>__{vreede}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{they're in a chemical induced coma. they're brain dead, vegetables.}
<A>__{blade angrily slams vreede's face against one of the pods.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{look at this! is this the future you want? you think there's a place for you in their world?}
<A>__{vreede starts crying, blubbering.}
<C>__{vreede}
<D>__{we don't have a choice! they're going to win, don't you see that?! he's come back! there's nothing stopping them now!}
<A>__{blade pulls vreede back so they're nose to nose }
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{there's me.}
<A>__{ and blade releases vreede.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{go. you've got thirty seconds.}
<A>__{vreede turns and runs, stumbling towards the door. despite his promise, blade lifts his mach. without even looking in vreede's direction, blade fires. we hear vreede drop. blade turns to abigail. she can hardly contain herself. nearby is a control console. blade unloads his mach pistol into it, damaging the interlinked life support systems. one by one, the vital signs and ekgs on the pods flat line, their warning tones rising into a collective, piercing wail.}
<C>__{blade }
<P>__{(feeling a heavy weight)}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{blade and abigail leave, turning the lights out as they go.}
