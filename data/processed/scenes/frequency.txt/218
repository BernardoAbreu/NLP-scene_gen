<A>__{john is woozy. he reaches down to his holster it is empty! shepard has got john's 9mm in his left hand. holding the .45 to john's head, shepard pops the clip out of the 9mm and tosses it aside. he then snaps a handcuff around john's wrist, begins dragging him to the radiator. john's foot erupts up into shepard's groin. the .45 goes flying across the room. for a suspended moment, both men are riveted to the .45 spinning on the floor.}
