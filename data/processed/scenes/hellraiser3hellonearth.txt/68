<L>__{exterior city streets, outside club night}
<A>__{the images are confusing, with the rapid pans and temporary loss of focus or light that characterise raw news footage. doc's camera weaves amongst a mass of uniformed people, trying to catch clear pictures of what's been happening. sirens howl, red emergency lights flash. it becomes clear we are looking at the aftermath of a disaster. or a massacre. the club building looks like a bomb hit it. smoke and debris litter the street. so do corpses. some of the dead bodies are simply dead bodies. others glimpsed fleetingly and tantalizingly as doc is jostled and bustled seem to be mutilated decoratively. in fact they bear hideous similarities to the artworks that used to grace the club: armless torsos wrapped in barbed wire; flayed limbs with machinery inside instead of muscle.}
