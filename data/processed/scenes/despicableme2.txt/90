<A>__{gru walks back home, completely depressed. walks past the college kids playing frisbee. catches the frisbee and tosses it down the sewer. walks past the group of bucket drummers. as he passes he kicks one of the buckets. walks past the old ladies doing tai chi. as they balance on one leg he pushes them all and they all fall over.}
<L>__{ext: gru's house night}
<A>__{it's pouring rain. gru sits alone outside his house. miserable. and then an umbrella approaches him. it looks like it's traveling on its own. but when it gets closer it lifts up, revealing agnes.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{i brought you an umbrella.}
<A>__{gru takes the umbrella and agnes joins him. they both huddle under it.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{ah, thank you.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{what're you doing out here?}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{remember when you said that i liked lucy? well, it turns out...you're right.}
<A>__{agnes's face lights up.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{yes, but...well, she's moving away.}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{i'm never going to see her again.}
<A>__{agnes's face falls. all her hopes and dreams shattered. but she tries to encourage gru.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{is there anything i can do to help?}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{oh, i don't i don't think so, sweetheart.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{well, is there anything you could do?}
<A>__{gru thinks.}
