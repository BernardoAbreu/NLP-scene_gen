<A>__{clock. it is twenty minutes to one and then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid day business jumble. camera pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the steps that lead up to the restaurant. in its journey, it passes kringelein looking up. he is not pointed. the camera then saunters getting a slow profile movement across near senf's desk. senf is very busy. the camera now passes profile the desk of senf. general action. senf stands before his background of slots and keys. we proceed until we are facing the elevator. at that moment the elevator is opening. among the people who emerge is suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish who she is. the camera pans quickly with her and in the distance we hear her saying to senf:}
<C>__{suzette}
<D>__{madam grusinskaya will not want her car.}
<A>__{this line is only just above the general clatter of action but it is picked up sharply first by senf then by bell captain and as the camera slowly turns around, we see the boy going towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance, saying:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{cancel madam grusinskaya's car.}
<A>__{the camera now backs away from the scene into the bar. (a section.) it backs to the back of the bar and proceeds in profile behind the backs of the barmen. a mixed crowd of people drinking before their lunch. we pick up the doctor, leaning his head upon his hands, looking into space. the woman next to him, a noisy blonde, is laughing. the doctor glances up at her she glances at the doctor. she and the audience see the scarred side of his face the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to her companion, who is the baron. we do not get much of a chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at his watch, his shoulders are turning away from the camera and he moves out towards the lobby. back up a few feet and lap dissolve : as you move into the main aisle of busy room in restaurant. great activity of waiters. the bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime. a string orchestra is playing. among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important to a table. the camera watches his face and follows him. his face just as camera reaches service table. the pompous maitre d'hotel now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter:}
<C>__{maitre d'hotel}
<D>__{where is that gentleman's soup?}
<A>__{the waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother to argue he tears off quickly (camera following him) to another service table. the waiter seizes buss boy's arm:}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{where's that soup?}
<A>__{boy goes off at great rate of speed, camera follows him, into service room of kitchen. boy stops at soup chef's counter. he is not the only waiter wanting soup at that moment. he pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket forward.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{quick come on come on...}
<A>__{the soup chef, used to impatient waiters, makes no exception of the young man. he looks at him as much as to say: "i will slap you on the mouth." at the same time he is pulling over a cauldron of soup.}
