<L>__{interior diner day}
<A>__{it's a local tourist place, but off season empty. joel sits in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup. an elderly couple drink coffee at the counter. clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood. joel glances at her bright blue hair. she picks an empty booth and sits. joel studies her discreetly. the waitress approaches her with a coffee pot.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{coffee?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{god, yes. you've saved my life!}
<A>__{the waitress pours the coffee.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{you know what you want yet?}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{ain't that the question of the century.}
<A>__{the waitress is not amused.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{you got grilled cheese and tomato soup?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{yeah. we're having a run on it.}
<A>__{the waitress heads to the grill. clementine fishes in her bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment, pours something in, then brings the cup back up.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{and some cream, please.}
<A>__{clementine looks around the place. her eyes meet joel's before he is able to look away. she smiles vaguely. he looks embarrassed, then down at his journal. clementine pulls a book from her purse and starts to read. joel glances up, tries to see the cover. it's blue. he can't read the title.}
