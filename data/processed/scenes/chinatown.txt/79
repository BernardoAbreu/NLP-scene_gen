<P>__{(after a long moment)}
<D>__{no, mr. gittes. that's what i am doing with the valley. the bond issue passes tuesday. there'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. i'm doing it.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{there's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{that's all taken care of. you see, mr. gittes. either you bring the water to l.a. or you bring l.a. to the water.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{how do you do that?}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{just incorporate the valley into the city so the water goes to l.a. after all. it's very simple.}
<A>__{gittes nods.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{how much are you worth?}
<C>__{cross}
<P>__{(shrugs, then)}
<D>__{i have no idea. how much do you want?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i want to know what you're worth. over ten million?}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{oh, my, yes.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{then why are you doing it? how much better can you eat? what can you buy that you can't already afford?}
<C>__{cross}
<P>__{(a long moment, then:)}
<D>__{the future, mr. gittes. the future. now where's the girl?... i want the only daughter i have left... as you found out, evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(with sarcasm)}
<D>__{who do you blame for that? her?}
<A>__{cross makes a funny little cock of his head.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{i don't blame myself. you see, mr. gittes, most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and right place, they're capable of anything. take those glasses from him, will you, claude?}
<A>__{mulvihill moves into view. extends his hand for the glasses. gittes doesn't move.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{it's not worth it, mr. gittes. it's really not worth it.}
<A>__{gittes hands over the glasses.}
<C>__{cross}
<D>__{take us to the girl. either evelyn allows me to see her, or i'm not averse to seeing evelyn in jail. if i have to buy the jail. hollis and evelyn kept her from me for fifteen years. it's been too long, i'm too old.}
