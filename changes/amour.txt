<LOC>__{INT. APARTMENT - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The hallway is a mess. A window opening onto a light well is open. The door to the apartment is suddenly broken open. A plain- clothes detective, two uniformed police officers and several firemen - also in uniform - enter and look around. They all wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses. Behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their way in. They're both holding their noses. In his free hand, the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional flyers. Behind him, comes a female neighbor.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(to the fire officer)}
<DIAL>__{Can you try?}
<ACTION>__{While the firemen go to work on the door, the plain-clothes detective goes into the adjoining dining room. He opens the windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via the double doors. They are locked and the gaps are also taped up. He turns to the right and goes into the living room, where he also opens up the windows...}

<DIAL>__{The door is open.}

<DIAL>__{Did you open the windows?}
<ACTION>__{The firemen shake their heads. The PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE turns toward the big double bed placed against the back wall of the bedroom. On the right- hand bed, there's only the bare mattress. On the left-hand bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman. Where once there were eyes, now there are only gaping holes. The corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers that have already dried out a little. On her chest is a crucifix. White letters on a black background: THE CREDITS}
<LOC>__{INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{All we see is the audience pouring into the hall. GEORGES and ANNE, both are around eighty, are part of this crowd. They go to their seats in one of the rows near the front. Once everybody is seated, we hear the usual ANNOUNCEMENT asking people to turn off their mobile phones. Some people, caught with their phones switched on, hasten to comply. Then the lights go out. APPLAUSE. Off-screen, we hear the soloist make his entrance. THROATS ARE CLEARED here and there. Finally, the MUSIC begins.}
<LOC>__{INT. ARTISTS DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The music from Scene 3 continues. The soloist is surrounded by admirers who congratulate him. Now Georges and Anne push their way into the room. (If the soloist is female, they will be carrying flowers, like most of the others). When the soloist notices their presence, he leaves his group of fans, heads towards them and greets them very warmly, visibly glad to see them.}
<LOC>__{INT. BUS - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Continuation of the MUSIC from Scene 3. Georges and Anne are seated side by side in the half empty bus. Anne talks enthusiastically, Georges says something from time to time, and smiles now and then. They are both relaxed and happy.}
<LOC>__{INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The door to the apartment is unlocked and opened from the outside. THE MUSIC ENDS. Georges comes in, turns on the light. He and Anne observe the open door. Around the lock, one can see the traces of an attempted forced entry. Georges bends down and runs his fingers over the deep grooves.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{They used a screwdriver or something like that...it doesn't look very professional...}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But who would do something like that?}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No idea. Why do people break in? Because they want to steal something.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{From us?}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(laughs briefly out loud)}
<DIAL>__{Hey, why not? If I thought about it, I could come up with at least three or four people we know who've been burgled.}
<ACTION>__{After having examined the outside of the second leaf of the double door, he comes in, closing the door behind him.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What time is it? Can't we call the superintendent?}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll do that tomorrow morning. Anyway, they didn't see anything.}

<ACTION>__{She goes toward him, he takes her coat off and hangs it with his in the closet.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Imagine if we were here, in our beds, and someone broke in.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why should I imagine that?}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But it's terrible! I think I'd die of fright.}

<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm tired.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I still fancy a drink.}
<ACTION>__{He puts away his shoes with the others and slips on his slippers. Anne has gone into the bathroom.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(O.S.)}
<DIAL>__{Go ahead then. Mathilde told me that in her building, the attic apartment was burgled from the loft. They just knocked a hole in the wall, cut out all of the valuable pictures from their frames and disappeared without a trace.}
<ACTION>__{He goes toward the kitchen.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{They must have been professionals.}
<ACTION>__{As he passes in front of the bathroom, he stops and appears to be looking at Anne.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Did I tell you, you looked good tonight?}
<ACTION>__{SHORT PAUSE. THEN:}
<CHAR>__{ANNE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(O.S.)}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(FLATTERED)}
<DIAL>__{What's got into you?}
<ACTION>__{With a gentle LAUGH, Georges disappears into the kitchen, where he turns on the lights. We hear him FIDDLING AROUND, apparently getting a glass and some wine. After a short}
<TRANS>__{PAUSE:}
<CHAR>__{ANNE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Weren't those semiquavers in the presto incredible? What staccato! Don't you agree?}

<DIAL>__{You're proud of him, huh?}
<LOC>__{INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Georges wakes up. He looks with amazement beside him, then raises his eyes. Anne is sitting upright, her back against the headboard.}

<DIAL>__{Something wrong?}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<ACTION>__{After a while, the RINGING of a kitchen egg-timer leads us to the next scene.}
<LOC>__{INT. KITCHEN - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The egg timer in the kitchen RINGS. Georges is seated in front of the window, at a table which is half set for breakfast. He has mobile phone raised to his ear and a phone book opened in front of him. Anne is getting up from the table. She goes toward the stove, turns off the gas, takes the egg out of the pan with a spoon and runs it under cold water. Like Georges, she is still in her robe.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(on the phone)}
<DIAL>__{What about next week? No but still, it would make sense to get it done soon. It might give people silly ideas. And anyway, it's too ugly to look at... Wednesday? What time? Ok... Will you bring the paint with you too, to paint over it? But at least some primer...Yes, Ok. Thank you.}
<ACTION>__{He hangs up.}

<DIAL>__{You can depend on that guy.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(laughs while acquiescing)}
<DIAL>__{Yes, that's true.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Reacting when she places the egg in his egg cup)}
<DIAL>__{Thanks. If I call a regular professional, we'll still be waiting two months time.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(more to herself)}
<DIAL>__{Really?}
<ACTION>__{She has sat down. Looks straight ahead. He cracks open his egg, puts salt on it, eats.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The Frodons waited three days when their toilet was blocked. Not exactly pleasant.}
<ACTION>__{He eats. Wants to put on more salt, but the saltcellar is empty.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{The saltcellar is empty.}
<ACTION>__{He looks up for an instant, as if he expected her to deal with it. As she doesn't react, he realizes the inappropriateness of such an expectation, gets up himself, heads for the kitchen cupboards and fills the salt cellar.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{I don't know if he's going to bring us the CD. Maybe he won't come at all. In any case, he didn't mention it. I'd like to buy it. It was really good and I don't want to wait long for it. We could go to Virgin this afternoon and buy it. What do you say?}
<ACTION>__{He comes back to the table and sits down again.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Hmmm? Anne? What's the matter?}
<ACTION>__{She looks at him and doesn't answer.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{What's going on? What's the matter?}
<ACTION>__{He waves his hand in front of her eyes and laughs nervously.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Helllloooo!!! Cuckoo!!! I'm here!}
<ACTION>__{She continues to look at him without reacting.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(serious now)}
<DIAL>__{Anne! What's going on?}
<ACTION>__{He waits, looks at her. No reaction. He stands up slightly, leans over the table to sit beside her. Tries to make her turn toward him.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Anne, what's the matter?}
<ACTION>__{He manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him, but her eyes look through him.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Anne...what's...}
<ACTION>__{He takes her face in both hands and turns toward him.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Anne...}
<ACTION>__{She stares into the void. He drops his hands. Then sits beside her, for quite awhile.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{SILENCE}
<ACTION>__{Finally he gets up, heads for the sink, turns on the tap, wets a tea towel, wrings it out a little, comes back and places it on Anne's face. Waits for a reaction that doesn't come. Then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and applies the cloth there. Then sits down and looks at her imploringly.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(close to tears)}
<DIAL>__{Anne...Darling...please!}
<ACTION>__{Once again they both remain seated. In the background, we hear the GUSHING of the tap that in his panic he has forgotten to turn it off. Making a sudden decision, he gets up, rapidly crossing the hallway, he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress agitatedly, which takes him quite a lot of time. Suddenly, the GUSHING of the tap stops, which had accompanied us as far as the bedroom. George doesn't notice it immediately, then he stops short.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Anne?}
<ACTION>__{Finally he returns, half dressed, into the kitchen. Anne is seated in the same place and looks at him.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What are you doing?}
<ACTION>__{She turns toward the breakfast.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{You left the water running.}
<ACTION>__{Georges stares at her.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(both aghast and furious)}
<DIAL>__{Hey, what's going on? Are you completely crazy? Is this supposed to be a joke, or what's going on?}
<ACTION>__{She looks at him with amazement.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What did you say?}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(SERIOUSLY)}
<DIAL>__{Is this a joke? Is this meant to be a joke?}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What joke? I don't get it! Why are you talking to me like that? What's got into you?}
<ACTION>__{Georges comes from the door to the table.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Anne! Please! Stop this game. It's not funny.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(GETTING IRRITATED)}
<DIAL>__{What game, for Christ's sake? What on earth's the matter?!!}
<ACTION>__{Georges is about to answer in a similarly irritated tone, but gradually begins to suspect that he could be mistaken. He tries to calm down, takes his chair that has remained beside Anne, sits down and looks at his wife. She doesn't know how to react.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What's the matter? Why didn't you react?}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{To what?}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{To what? To me, to everything.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{When?}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Just now. A moment ago.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Please tell me what's wrong. What am I supposed to have done?}
<ACTION>__{Georges first looks away reluctantly, then looks at Anne. He doesn't want to believe that its serious.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't know what to say. Do you really not know what just happened?}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But what DID happen?}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(almost reluctantly bowing his head as he speaks)}
<DIAL>__{You were sitting there, staring at me. You didn't answer me when I asked you what the matter was.}
<ACTION>__{He picks up the wet tea towel from the table.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{I put this tea towel on your face, and you didn't react.}
<ACTION>__{Anne looks at the towel, then at Georges, and shakes her head, perturbed that she can't understand. Georges looks at her. He sees the damp marks on the collar of her robe.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Look... There's still dampness on your collar.}
<ACTION>__{Anne follows his gesture, tugs on her collar and sees the damp marks. She slowly grasps that something is awry.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{When... When was it?}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Just now, a few minutes ago.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So...??}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There's no "So". I went into the bedroom to get dressed. I wanted to get help.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Help?}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, and then you turned off the tap.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes. Because you left it on.}

<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why? What can he do?}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't know. Examine you.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me.}
<CHAR>__{GEORGES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Anne, please!! That's absurd. We can't pretend that nothing happened.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But what DID happen?}
<ACTION_ALT>__{PAUSE.}
<CHAR>__{ANNE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}

<DIAL>__{No!}

It was a huge drama, and the poor little darling wound up trying to commit suicide. That scared him and he came back to me in full remorse. I've got used to it now.

They thought it would do me good to spend the summer with kids my own age... We were lodged in an old castle in the midst of a magnificent wooded landscape... I think it was in the Auvergne... I don't know... in any case it was the opposite of what I'd expected... We had to get up at 6 and go for a morning swim. Not far from the castle, there was a pond fed by an icy mountain stream. We entered it running, in a double file. You know, I was never very sporty. They had a program to keep us on the go all day, probably to nip any potential pubescent impulses in the bud ... But the worst thing was the food. The third day after our arrival, there was rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice pudding. We sat at long tables in a huge hall. I didn't want to eat the stuff and the housemaster said to me: You won't get up until you've cleared your plate. So after the meal everybody left the room, and I remained seated, in tears. I had made a secret pact with Mom. I was to send her a postcard every week.}

<DIAL>__{If I was pleased with the place I was to draw some flowers on it, or if not, some stars. She kept the card; it was covered all over in stars. After three hours, I was allowed to leave the table. I went up to my room, got into bed and had a fever of 42 degrees. It was diphtheria. They took me to the nearest hospital where I was put in an isolation ward, which meant that Mom, when she came to visit me, could only wave at me through a window. At some point I lost that postcard. It's a pity.}
<ACTION>__{Anne has become ever calmer during Georges' story. He still holds her hand.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{LONG SILENCE.}
<ACTION>__{Then Georges reaches across Anne's body to get hold of his pillow and presses it over her face. STIFLED SOUNDS from Anne. Everything that can still move in her body starts to move. Georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it with his whole weight, for a long time, until all Anne's movements stop. Then he sits up, exhausted, and without removing the pillow from her face, remains seated beside her.}

<ACTION>__{Hallway. The front door of the apartment is unlocked. Georges, in city clothes, enters with two big shopping bags full of cut flowers. He puts down the bags, takes off his coat, hangs it in the closet. The TELEPHONE RINGS. Georges takes the bags and carries them in the kitchen, puts them in the sink, fills it with water. He starts to cut the stems and put the flowers in the water. We watch him doing so for a while. Meanwhile, the TELEPHONE}

<ACTION>__{Georges has opened one of the sections of the large wall closet. He is looking for a specific dress. He takes some out, puts them back inside. One of the dresses slips off its hanger and falls to the floor. He picks it up, hangs it up again. He ends up finding the one he was looking for. He takes it out on its hanger. Closes the closet again. Looks at the dress. Then he lowers his arm a little and is about to leave the bedroom. He catches his feet in the dress. He just saves himself from tripping up by grabbing on to the wheelchair that is parked there. Exhausted, he flops down into it.}

<ACTION>__{Georges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast with Anne in Scene 8, and writes a letter. PAUSES for reflection. GENTLE COOING OF PIGEONS, scarcely audible. Suddenly, Georges starts. At the far end of the long kitchen, beside the door between the kitchen units, a pigeon is walking. Georges stares at it. For a long time. Then he gets up slowly and, via the door located beside the kitchen table, he goes into the adjoining room. On the sofa there, he has set up his new bed. He takes the wool blanket from the bed and comes back into the kitchen, carefully approaches the pigeon that then runs off in alarm. Georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it over the pigeon. But it manages to escape into the hallway. Georges follows it. This action is repeated several times. The pigeon is more and more panicky, starts to fly up, flutters about in all directions. Georges closes the light- well window to cut off its escape route. This lasts an exhausting amount of time, but he ends up capturing it. He cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby.}

<ACTION>__{From the adjoining room, we see Georges seated at the kitchen table, writing. Finally we see what he is writing: ... you won't believe it. A pigeon came in, for the second time already, through the light well. This time I caught it. In fact it wasn't difficult at all. But I set it free again. I'm going to ...}

<ACTION>__{Georges is lying on his bed in the adjoining room, staring at the ceiling. O.S., we faintly hear the SOUND of running water, and from time to time the CLATTERING OF DISHES. After a while, Georges gets up and goes into the kitchen. He remains in the doorway and watches Anne who, doing the dishes, at first doesn't pay attention to him, then notices his presence and shoots him a quick glance, saying casually:}

<ACTION>__{Georges looks at her an instant longer, passes beside her, goes into the hallway, sits down on a stool beside the closet and puts on his shoes. O.S. we hear Anne finishing her work. She comes out, hangs up her apron in the closet, disappears for a few moments into the bathroom. Meanwhile, Georges has got up, and looks in the bathroom where, clearly, Anne is tidying her hair and sprucing herself up. When she comes out again, he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it on.}

<ACTION>__{Four long shots: all the windows are open. The sun is shining. It is fairly bright. Hallway. SILENCE. Then the SOUND OF A LOCK BEING OPENED. Eva comes into the apartment. Remains a long time beside the door. Looks around her, ill at ease. Finally she hesitantly goes into the bedroom. Anne's twin bed isn't there any more. On Georges' bed lies only the bare mattress. Eva remains there a moment, then goes through the partition door into the dining room. There, everything is as usual. Eva continues into the living room. There too, everything is as usual. Eva stops by the piano stool. Looks out of the window, feeling at a loss. Then she heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner. On the table lie the remains of a snack. Eva looks at the table, turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear STREET NOISE. Then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the armchairs. Her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room. END CREDITS (white on a black background)}
