<L>__{exterior. the bar night}
<A>__{high angle shot looking down on the sidewalk immediately outside the bar arnold and charlie have just come out of. there is a house with a small stoop, and arnold is standing slumped by the stoop, holding himself up by the iron railing. he is being sick, quietly retching. charlie is standing a few paces away from him in the middle of the sidewalk, a deeply unhappy figure in his own right. from our angle, we may or may not be able to tell that charlie is crying. close shot of charlie standing in the middle of the sidewalk of sixth avenue and tenth street, the whole dark world around him, silent and empty. he is crying quietly, unashamedly, his shoulders shaking ever so little. behind him, arnold is bent over the railing of the stoop, weak and spent. another shot of the two men. charlie stops crying, sighs, and starts toward arnold.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{are you all right, arnold?}
<A>__{arnold nods weakly. charlie gets out a handkerchief and gives it to arnold who begins to weakly clean his chin and spots on his suit.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{would you like to go back in and sit down?}
<A>__{arnold shakes his head weakly "no."}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what subway do you take, arnold, the bmt? can you make it?}
<A>__{arnold nods weakly. charlie puts his arm supportively around his friend's back, but arnold makes no move yet, being thoroughly drained.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{come on, arnold, i will take you home.}
<A>__{there is a clicking of high heels on concrete pavement, and charlie looks up. the existentialist has just come out of the party several houses down and has come up a few steps and is standing watching them. she has her bag and her light summer stole. she nods to charlie, sort of smiles, moves a few steps closer to them.}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<D>__{is he all right?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{yeah, he's all right. look, i've got to take my friend home...}
<A>__{the two men start slowly down the street to the corner. arnold leaning heavily on his friend. the existentialist stands, watching them a moment.}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<P>__{(calling lightly)}
<D>__{are you coming back? where does he live? how long will you be?}
<A>__{reverse shot charlie and arnold just about getting to the corner. charlie hasn't heard her. full shot of the existentialist watching them disappear around the corner. then she turns, and, wetting her lips, she hurries back to the house where the party is.}
