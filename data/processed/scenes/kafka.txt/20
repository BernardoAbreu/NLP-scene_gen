<A>__{fat men night sit laughing, jowls gyrating, around a table filled with an abnormal amount of food. one of them stops laughing then, and the others follow suit, one after the other in turn, until they're all silent, looking at the same thing. we're in a fancy restaurant, and the other customers have also turned away from their dinners for the moment to stare at the man in black who stands before the fat men. the man wears a black mask as well. he presents the fat men with a covered tray. they look at it, then back at him but he's walked away. they look at the tray again and one of them lifts the cover. underneath lies the classic black bowling ball with a fuse burning at the top. the fat men all try to stand up at once but boom! their booth explodes with them in it. at the doorway, holding a revolver loosely in one hand to discourage heroes, the man in black turns calmly to face the stunned restaurant.}
