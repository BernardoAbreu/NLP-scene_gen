<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior museum night}
<A>__{there are cops and journalists, ambulances, and medivacs all over the place. greg kawakita, wet and bedraggled as a rat, runs up from columbus ave. behind him the mayor and d'agosta help the rest of the company to the ambulances. waters is on the steps of the museum, helping to organize the rescue efforts as kawakita runs up to pendergast.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{margo green. have you seen her?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{she's over here.}
<A>__{greg turns to see margo come out of the rotunda with frock, jonathan and hobbes. her face is devastated. he moves to her side. she reacts as she sees him, and teacher and pupil hug. d'agosta is lost in the swirl of people. and he likes it like that. he rests against a large stone lion, pulls out a cheap cigar in cellophane, unwraps it carefully and tries to light it with a wet match. he's struggling hopelessly. finally he tosses the useless pack of matches, sighs. but then a flame lowers right before his face. he looks up to see pendergast holding a silver engraved lighter. d'agosta smiles, takes a nice long hit.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{nice to see you, lieutenant.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{the sub basement, huh? great idea.}
<A>__{we go to a wide shot of the museum as we slowly pull back...}
