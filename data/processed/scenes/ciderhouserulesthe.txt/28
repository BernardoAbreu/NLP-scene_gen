<L>__{interior operating room day}
<A>__{angela sits with the still etherized dorothy while larch and homer confer over a basin containing dorothy's uterus.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{there was no visible wound?}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{no. the fetus was dead. her uterus was virtually disintegrating my stitches pulled right through the tissue!}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(mystified)}
<D>__{it looks like scurvy.}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(derisively sarcastic)}
<D>__{scurvy! ah yes, the curse of the old time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. homer, dorothy isn't a sailor!}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{she's a prostitute, isn't she?}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(to angela)}
<D>__{did you look in her purse?}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{i looked everywhere else!}
<A>__{angela hands larch a bottle of brown liquid.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{it's called french lunar solution.}
<A>__{larch wrinkles his nose at the odor.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{it's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{it claims to restore monthly regularity.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{it's obviously an aborticide.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{obviously.}
<A>__{larch wets his finger with the stuff, then touches it to his tongue.}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(spits)}
<D>__{christ, it's oil of tansy!}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i don't know it.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{if you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb vitamin c.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{in other words, scurvy.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{good boy. good job. and you call yourself "not a doctor"!}
<P>__{(to angela)}
<D>__{keep an eye on her she's in trouble.}
<A>__{as homer turns to leave, larch stops him; he points to the basin.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{take care of that, will you?}
<A>__{homer stops, annoyed; he picks up the basin and empties the contents into a white enamel pail.}
