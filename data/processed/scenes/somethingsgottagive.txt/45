<L>__{exterior house the following morning}
<A>__{the place is a mess, the aftermath of the storm.}
<L>__{interior erica's bedroom the same time}
<A>__{harry spoons with erica on her side of 'the bed, his arms snuggly around her. the electricity pops bagk on and the room is suddenly lit up and one of erica's french cds comes on full blast. harry opens his eyes. he's surprised to see he has his arm around her. erica awakens just as surprised. in the light of day, a definite hint of embarrassment ...}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(grabs his watch, blinks)}
<D>__{can you see this?}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{erica...}
<P>__{(she turns)}
<D>__{you are a woman to love.}
<A>__{erica smiles, then walks away with the achey walk of a woman who hasn't had sex in many a year but has more than made up for it in the last 12 hours. she holds onto the wall as she exits the room, a little bow legged, like she's just gotten off a horse. alone in the hallway, she stops.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you are woman to love. what the hell does that mean?}
<B>__{an ekg machine}
<A>__{spits out a long tape. tilt up to julian at the end of the tape. harry sits on an examining table in julian's office, buttoning up his shirt.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{okay, buddy, i'm sending you home. these past few days have done wonders for you.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, i've been working on that stair thing. i can do it by the way.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{do what?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{climb a flight of stairs. several times actually.}
<A>__{harry stands, tucks in his shirt, smiling proudly to himself.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{way to go. how's erica?}
<C>__{harry}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{julian. thanks for everything.}
<A>__{julian shakes harry's hand. harry's eyes tear up.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{you're gonna be okay.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(touching his tears)}
<D>__{what the...? this is the second time i've done this now. i get overcome or something. . .}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{it's very common to become emotional after having an episode like you've had. everything takes on a new meaning.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(wiping his tears)}
<D>__{so it's not crazy for a man to do something entirely out of character after having a heart attack?}
<C>__{julian}
<P>__{(handing him kleenex)}
<D>__{like crying?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah and totally changing their tastes. like suddenly really liking something they never thought they could like...ever...and i'm talking really liking it. it's...unnerving.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i think you can expect just about anything right now. people have done some wild things after having a heart attack...selling businesses, getting divorced, moving... some people say it saved their lives.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{but most people go back to being themselves, right? i will go back to being me, won't i?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{we'll see.}
<A>__{erica typing her phone rings she wears a blouse with more buttons unbuttoned than ever in her life. she picks up the phone. harry drives erica's car, top down.}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, he said... by tomorrow for absolute sure. you think you can deal with me for one more night?}
<A>__{a crowded club southampton that night packed with young people. in the middle of this twentysomething sun burnt beach crowd, we find, erica and harry, the two coolest people in the room, dancing with each other. a little 'later the karaoke room harry leads erica through a crowd listening to a girl singing britney spears' oops, i did it again. when she finishes the crowd enthusiastically applauds.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(big breath)}
<D>__{okay, here goes...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{here goes what?}

<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(sings)}
<D>__{i wish you bluebirds in the spring... to give your heart a song to sing... and then a kiss, but more than this... i wish you love...}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{don't want to blow this part...}
