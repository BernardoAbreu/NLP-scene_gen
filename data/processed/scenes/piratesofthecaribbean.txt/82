<L>__{interior caves main cavern night}
<A>__{ and then emerge into the largest cavern of all, also crammed with treasure, including several mountains of gold coins that reach the ceiling. treasure everywhere except for one spot in the center. a hole in the ceiling lets in a column of moonlight, which illumines: a stone chest, lid pushed back, decorated with carved aztec glyphs, filled with gold coins identical to will's medallion. a sharp stone knife lies on top. in front of it, buried in the sand is a skeleton and this one doesn't look like it's going to move ever again, judging by the sword in its back. a crab scurries away from it as the group approaches.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{here we stand before the cursed treasure of cortez himself. won by blood, it demands blood in return.}
<A>__{all eyes turn onto elizabeth. pintle takes the stone knife from the chest, approaches her. elizabeth shrinks back, but is held by two other pirates. pintel grins. grabs her by the wrist. she turns her head away, shuts her eyes. pintle raises the knife ... ... and then very carefully, daintily, uses just the sharp tip of the knife to just prick! elizabeth's finger. one tiny red drop of blood appears, and drips down onto the medallion. elizabeth opens her eyes, surprised.}
<C>__{pintel}
<D>__{what did you expect? we're all gentlemen here, right and proper.}
<A>__{the pirates laugh. barbossa takes the medallion, grins at elizabeth.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{you know the first thing i'm going to do after the curse is lifted?}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{eat a whole bushel of apples.}
<A>__{barbossa approaches the chest, shining in the beam of moonlight.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{what was begun by blood, let blood now end!}
<A>__{he tosses the gold medallion onto the others. the pirates tense, waiting, expectant. a long beat. they all look at each other, look at themselves. nothing happens.}
<C>__{koehler}
<D>__{did it work?}
<C>__{deadeye}
<D>__{i don't feel no different.}
<C>__{jacoby}
<D>__{how do we tell?}
<A>__{barbossa frowns, draws his pistol, and shoots the pirate next to him jacoby square in the chest. jacoby reacts in shock, grabs his chest ... but doesn't die.}
<C>__{koehler}
<D>__{you're not dead.}
<C>__{jacoby}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(realizes)}
<D>__{he shot me!}
<C>__{twigg}
<D>__{it didn't work! the curse is still upon us!}
<A>__{barbossa searches his mind for an answer ... turns to elizabeth.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{you. maid. your father. what was his name?!}
<P>__{(grabs her roughly)}
<D>__{was your father william turner?!}
<A>__{elizabeth takes time to smile before answering:}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{the pirates cry out in alarm. barbossa gathers himself, getting his rage under steely control.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{where's his child? the child that sailed from england eight years ago, the child who is the real owner of that medallion, the child in whose veins flows the blood of william turner?! where?}
<A>__{barbossa slaps her hard across the face, sending her sprawling.}
<C>__{jacoby}
<P>__{(to pintel)}
<D>__{you brought us the wrong person!}
<C>__{pintel}
<D>__{she had the medallion! she's the right age. she said her name was turner!}
<C>__{twigg}
<P>__{(to barbossa)}
<D>__{you brought us here for nothing?}
<A>__{barbossa whirls on him }
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{if you had sailed with morgan for ten years like i have, you'd know not to question me!}
<A>__{elizabeth sits up, watching the pirates argue, for a moment unnoticed. suddenly, a scabbard comes down, right above her. startled, elizabeth looks up will is at the top of a mound of coins, reaching down with his scabbard for her to grab onto. elizabeth quickly leans forward, takes the bloodied medallion from the pile. reaches back, grabs the scabbard. will pulls her up }
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{if any coward here dare challenge me, let him speak! any more talk, i will chain ye to a cannon and send ye to the watery depths!}
<A>__{a sound catches his attention coins falling. he looks up, sees will and elizabeth at the top of the treasure stack. atop the stack, will grabs a large shield, flings them forward the two ride down the mountain of coins on the far side, slide through a small opening }
