<A>__{ray and cooch go through the car, around the car, with gloved hands and grease pencils and plastic bags, sweating in the hot sun.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{tread matches. it's the car.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{excited, ray walks off, scanning the area.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{but this doesn't make any sense, ray. if it's just been sitting in this dry wash for seven days... why the hell didn't we find it?}
<A>__{ray picks up a handful of stones, sifts them in his hands.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{because this isn't a dry wash.}
<A>__{cooch watches him slosh shoes first through a rut where the water shimmers a foot deep or less.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's the little walking river.}
<A>__{ray turns, shucking up mud.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{and it was full of water when i drove by here three days ago. full. i mean... a river.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{the little walking river. you're right. this is part of it. so whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. goddamn.}
<A>__{ray doesn't hear cooch. he stares past the sac at the long wide chasm, wet in some places, arid in others, and what he hears must be an echo in his head.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{listen to the water...}
<A>__{cooch is listening to a transmission across his radio and he walks off a few feet, exchanging information with the}
<B>__{regionals.}
<A>__{ray stands, ankle deep in stagnant water, his face sweat soaked, his eyes transfixed on heat undulations.}
