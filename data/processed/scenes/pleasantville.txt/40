<L>__{interior soda shop.}
<A>__{david is trapped behind the counter, furiously working to keep up with the load. several clean cut teenagers pepper him with orders while he yanks at the pumps and spiggots. it's clear he isn't used to this.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(frazzled)}
<D>__{peppermint shake, chocolate soda, two orders of fries and a split?}
<C>__{teen age girl}
<D>__{peppermint soda, two chocolate shakes, order of fries, and we'll split it.}
<A>__{david nods quickly, wiping some sweat from his brow. he scoops some ice cream into the metal blender as mr. johnson comes up beside him.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{there aren't any cheeseburgers.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{well, usually i put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{listen to me!}
<A>__{mr. johnson recoils slightly.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{do you have the lettuce?}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{... yeah.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{have you cooked the burgers?}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<P>__{(quieter)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.}
<A>__{mr. johnson stares at him.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{really. it's fine.}
<B>__{different angle. soda shop entrance.}
<A>__{the screen door swings open and is held there by the end of a letterman's sweater. a moment later, jennifer sashays through, parading her new jane russell profile. her "girlfriends" titter from the comer as biff rushes up to a table, and pulls out a chair. she sashays into it, brushing against him as she goes.}
<B>__{angle. david.}
<A>__{he stares motionless at the spectacle concerned and apprehensive. david holds a hot fudge sundae under the soda spiggot and jerks back on the lever blowing ice cream all over his chest.}
<B>__{full shot. table.}
<A>__{biff stares across the table at jennifer with the wholesome devotion of a labrador retriever. he looks like a cross between troy donahue and a mannequin.}
<C>__{biff}
<P>__{(haltingly)}
<D>__{i sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight mary sue.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(full blown "mary sue")}
<D>__{well "gee whizz" biff. i sure am glad you asked me.}
<A>__{he guffaws for a moment or two before speaking again.}
<C>__{biff}
<D>__{i don't know if i ever said this to you before, but, well ... i think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{really biff? the keenest?}
<C>__{biff}
<D>__{oh yeah.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(all sarcasm)}
<D>__{gosh. i hardly know what to say.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{what can i get you two?}
<B>__{wider.}
<A>__{he stands at their table holding a little white pad of paper and a pencil. jennifer looks up at her brother and almost bursts out laughing. he wears his soda jerk hat at a jaunty angle with large white apron tied around his neck.}
<C>__{biff}
<D>__{oh, i dunno bud. guess i will have my usual cheeseburger and a cherry coke.}
<A>__{more goony laughs. david turns to jennifer who puts on the same dopey countenance.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{oh, i dunno bud. guess i will just have a salad and an evian water.}
<A>__{he shoots her a dirty look. jennifer just smiles at him.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{cheeseburger it is.}
<B>__{angle. following david.}
<A>__{he glowers at her all the way back to the counter. david posts the order in the little carousel clip board, keeping an eye on the table the entire time ...}
<B>__{resume. table.}
<A>__{biff gazes across the table at jennifer with an adoring look on his face. his hands are properly folded in front of him. she's still trying to do her best "mary sue."}
<C>__{biff}
<D>__{see the whole time we were in civics together, i really wanted to sit next to you but you were always sitting between peggy jane and lisa anne.}
<A>__{there is some tittering behind her. jennifer doesn't respond.}
<C>__{biff }
<D>__{... and you always seemed so smart and everything. like that report you did on "our town hall." gosh. i didn't know what i'd talk to you about.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{well, sometimes talking's over rated. don't you think?}
<C>__{biff}
<D>__{hunh?}
<P>__{(goony laugh)}
<D>__{oh, right ...}
<A>__{he still doesn't understand. biff guffaws for a moment or two then glances down at the table top. there is a momentary break in the music as johnny mathis' "misty" starts up all over again. it's enough to make you shoot yourself.}
<C>__{biff }
<D>__{so i know i haven't been steady with anybody, but i just don't want to rush it. you don't want to make a mistake with something that important.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{oh, gosh no.}
<C>__{biff}
<D>__{i mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but i figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. don't you?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{oh you bet.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{will you excuse me for a sec?}
<A>__{jennifer gets up in a daze and heads toward the bathroom.}
<B>__{angle. david.}
<A>__{he freezes behind the counter and watches as his sister practically stumbles through the bathroom door.}
