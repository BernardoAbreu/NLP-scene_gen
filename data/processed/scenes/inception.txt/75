<A>__{nash, beaten bloody, sits on the far side, slumped against the wine. beside him: saito. he nods politely at cobb.}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{he sold you out. thought to come to me and bargain for his life...}
<A>__{saito's bodyguard offers cobb a gun.}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{so i offer you the satisfaction.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{that's not how i deal with things.}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{would you work with him again?}
<A>__{cobb shakes his head. saito's bodyguards pull nash from the chopper. saito motions cobb and arthur to sit. the chopper rises. cobb watches nash dragged across the pad.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{what will you do to him?}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{nothing. but i can't speak for your friends from cobol engineering.}
<A>__{saito looks out at the city slipping by.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{what do you want from us?}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{inception.}
<A>__{arthur raises his eyebrows. cobb is poker faced.}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{is it possible?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{of course not.}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{if you can steal an idea from someone's mind, why can't you plant one there instead?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{okay, here's planting an idea: i say to you, "don't think about elephants."}
<C>__{arthur }
<P>__{(saito nods)}
<D>__{what are you thinking about?}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{elephants.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{right. but it's not your idea because you know i gave it to you.}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{you could plant it subconsciously }
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{the subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea. true inspiration is impossible to fake.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{no, it isn't.}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{can you do it?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i won't do it.}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{in exchange, i will give you the information you were paid to steal.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{are you giving me a choice? because i can find my own way to square things with cobol.}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{then you do have a choice.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{and i choose to leave.}
