<B>__{at the junction box}
<A>__{rachel checks the car park behind for workers.}
<B>__{at the fence}
<A>__{the train is almost past. the two men work feverishly, snipping through the remaining links, working their way towards each other forming a four foot long split in the fence. they sprint for the stanchion again...}
<C>__{stephan}
<P>__{(as he runs)}
<D>__{twenty, twenty one, twenty two...}
<A>__{as they dive for cover the last carriages of the train pass. a guard on the platform glances over but sees nothing but darkness and the vague outline of the postal vans beyond the fence. he continues walking down the platform.}
<B>__{at the van}
<A>__{rachel holds her breath, but nothing disturbs the new silence. along the fence she can just make out the two men crouched in the shadows. stephan raises his hand in an ok, signalling they're ready. rachel suddenly hears footsteps echoing in the car park. through the window of a van, she can see a postal worker emerging from the depot and crossing the car park. as she watches he takes out a cigarette, starts to light it but then stops. he is staring over at the footbridge, as if he can faintly make out those dark shapes at the base... he takes a few steps forward, puzzled. a little closer and he might really see something... rachel looks to the platform the two guards visible there are talking to each other, looking the other way. she takes her chance moves up behind the parked vans...}
<B>__{on the worker}
<A>__{..as he takes a few steps closer to where stephan and david are crouched...}
<C>__{rachel }
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{do you have a light?}
<A>__{the man turns and takes in this pretty postal worker, who has emerged behind him. he smiles and walks back towards her. he lights her cigarette, studies her face.}
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{you new?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{first shift. the girls said it was okay to come out for a smoke....}
<B>__{at the fence}
<A>__{david and stephan lie listening to the murmured conversation.}
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{yeah, it's okay. are you working until midnight?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{after the late shift most of us go to the vetter. do you know it?}
<A>__{david checks his watch again, nods at stephan. we hear another approaching train.}
<B>__{on rachel}
<A>__{...smiling, pretending to be listening to the worker.}
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{...it's just on the corner. you should come along.}
<A>__{she glances through the fence and down the track to where the train's light can be seen approaching in the gloom. this is it.}
<B>__{inside the van}
<A>__{the inert body of vogel, lying on the floor. his hands, bound at the wrist, suddenly twitch involuntarily. in the train driver's cab continuous pov the border guards on the platform. the driver begins to brake.}
<B>__{on the platform}
<A>__{the border guards watch in surprise as the train slows...}
<B>__{at the fence}
<A>__{as it passes them, the train screens stephan and david from the platform. the two men rise and swiftly begin to cut the remaining section of fence. as the train comes to a halt the last carriages stop directly opposite them, empty and dark. they're almost there.}
<B>__{on the platform}
<A>__{in the distance, at the head of the train, the driver can be seen stepping down and gesturing to the guards, pointing up ahead.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{there's something on the tracks up here!}
<A>__{the guards peer doubtfully into the gloom ahead. one sets off to investigate.}
<B>__{on rachel}
<A>__{...getting rid of the worker.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{well, maybe i will see you there? i finish in half an hour. why don't you go and get me a drink ready?}
<A>__{the worker can't believe his luck.}
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{half an hour then.}
<A>__{he starts to move towards the gate... suddenly the van horn blares, shattering the silence of the car park.}
<B>__{at the fence}
<A>__{stephan and david turn back to the van.}
<B>__{on rachel}
<A>__{she turns, shocked. the worker too turns back in surprise.}
<B>__{in the van}
<A>__{vogel, hands still tied has wormed his way over the seats and is pressing frantically on the horn. he claws at the tape over his mouth, manages to pull it free. stephan leaps into the van and is upon him in seconds. vogel manages to give a hoarse yell, then stephan uses a krav magah move to silence him.}
<B>__{on the platform}
<A>__{the remaining border guard is staring over at the darkened car park, trying to work out what he just heard.}
<B>__{on rachel}
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{what was that...?}
<B>__{at the fence}
<A>__{david watches in dismay as a guard comes into view at the far end of the platform, entering a guard hut. he lifts a telephone inside.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{fuck.}
<A>__{he heads for the van at a crouching run.}
<B>__{on rachel}
<A>__{rachel indicates the vans closest to them.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i think it came from over here?}
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{no, it was one of those...}
<A>__{he steps past her, peering at the shadowy vans ahead. rachel stares at him wondering if she can take him down silently.}
<C>__{border guard }
<D>__{stay where you are!}
<A>__{she turns to see two border guards approaching the side gate of the car park.}
<B>__{on the platform}
<A>__{...as the border guard comes back from checking the lines ahead.}
<C>__{border guard}
<D>__{there's nothing there. get moving now!}
<A>__{his part of the mission completed, the driver climbs back into his cab.}
<B>__{on rachel}
<A>__{...as one of the guards approaches her, pistol drawn. the second guard fans past, walking slowly towards the bridge. the first guard shines a torch into rachel's face.}
<C>__{first guard}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i work here. i'm on a break.}
<C>__{first guard}
<D>__{show me your papers, both of you.}
<A>__{the worker nervously fumbles for his papers, passes them to the guard who inspects them.}
<B>__{at the fence}
<A>__{david watches rachel offer her papers to the guard as the train starts to rumble back into life. he moves back towards the van.}
<B>__{at the van}
<C>__{stephan}
<P>__{(hissing)}
<D>__{we have to go!}
<A>__{david stares over at rachel. stephan grabs vogel.}

<D>__{we can make it. help me with him...}
<B>__{on rachel}
<C>__{first guard}
<P>__{(handing them back)}
<D>__{you can go.}
<A>__{the worker gratefully hurries away. rachel is watching tensely as the second guard closes on the van...}
<B>__{at the van}
<A>__{stephan watches the train pulling away, their last chance. he has pulled vogel's body to the door.}
<C>__{stephan}
<P>__{(hissing)}
<D>__{we're going! now!}
<A>__{david shakes his head.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{not without her.}
<A>__{he moves up the blind side of the van...}
<B>__{in front of the van}
<A>__{the second guard takes a few more steps and stops in surprise the opening in the fence visible now.}
<C>__{second guard}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{hey! over here!}
<A>__{david appears behind him and downs him, fast. a guard on the platform has turned to see the opening in the fence, and yells out.}
<B>__{on rachel}
<A>__{as the guard beside her turns his attention to his comrade, rachel grabs the guard's gun hand, sweeping it away from her, at the same time stepping in close and punching the guard's throat with her other hand. as he staggers back choking, she twists the gun free.}
<B>__{on the platform}
<A>__{another guard hits an alarm. a siren begins to sound...}
<B>__{on rachel}
<A>__{about to head back to the van. a shot rings out and a bullet suddenly strikes the ground beside her. she looks up to see a guard has appeared up on the bridge, rifle aimed at her. other guards open fire, jumping down onto the tracks and advancing towards the cut fence. acting on instinct, rachel returns fire with the pistol, and takes cover behind the wall...}
<B>__{at the van}
<A>__{stephan has jumped into the driver's seat and starts the engine. david scrambles into the back, barely making it before stephan is peeling out, the back door hanging open...}
<B>__{on rachel}
<A>__{...as more guards appear at the side gate behind her she's caught between them now. she watches in dismay as the van heads for the exit. suddenly it brakes...}
<B>__{in the van}
<A>__{stephan throws the gear into reverse..}
<B>__{on rachel}
<A>__{and the van begins to reverse with a scream of tyres towards rachel. the guards at the side gate open fire on the van hurtling towards them, bullets pocking the rear doors. the side door is flung open and rachel dives in, just as stephan roars forward again.}
