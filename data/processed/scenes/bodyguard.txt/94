<A>__{frank is investigating the small packet, with a surgeon's precision, checking it with a stethoscope and a metal detector, sniffing at it. it has been addressed in the normal way, except that rachel's name has been cut out of a magazine and pasted above the address. he begins carefully slicing away the wrapping. inside is a cardboard box. the contents are still hidden by packing paper. he picks it away with tweezers. suddenly there is a loud buzzing from the box and movement in the paper. frank drops the box into a bed of sand in a sink surrounded by sandbags. the movement slows and stops. frank extracts the item it is a wind up mechanical beaver with a hand painted sign hung around its neck:}
<D>__{we love you, rachel your fans in beaver, pa.}
<C>__{sally and kate.}
<A>__{the beaver's teeth click in frank's hand. we see frank's face. this may just have taken years off his life. he holds his hand out straight, palm downwards, and looks at it. no tremor. just checking. spector's voice suddenly shouts from the next door office.}

<D>__{farmer! get in here!}
