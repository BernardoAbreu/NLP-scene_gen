<A>__{ethan and ambrose rise from the fall. ethan jumps up and sweeps ambrose, dropping him to the ground. ethan begins strangling ambrose but gets knocked off, and when they both stand, ambrose gets ethan in a choke hold. ambrose hits him and grabs a rock and hits ethan in the midsection and the face. ethan kicks it out of his hand and connects with several punches, knocking ambrose to the ground. kneeling, ambrose pulls a knife from a boot holster and cuts ethan across the back and face. ambrose dives on ethan and the knife is poised above ethan's eye before ethan grabs the knife and clears, holding it out toward ambrose.}

<A>__{ambrose swings again and misses, and ethan delivers a series of kicks, leaving ambrose stunned and barely standing. ethan steps back, and with a running start, strikes ambrose with a leaping kick that drops him to the ground and knock the knife out of his hand.}
