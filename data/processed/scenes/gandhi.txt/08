<A>__{convention tent interior day high. coming into focus is a lighted platform, and as the scene becomes clearer we see figures on the platform and the banner which reads indian national congress, and we hear the emotional voice of jinnah at the microphone.}
<C>__{jinnah}
<P>__{(gradually fading in)}
<D>__{we were asked for toleration. we were asked for patience. some gave it and some did not. well, their war is over! and those of us who supported it, and those of us who refused must forget our differences!}
<A>__{the camera has been moving in; now it jumps to jinnah in close shot and intercuts with the impact of his fervid delivery on the audience.}
<C>__{jinnah}
<D>__{and there can be no excuses from the british now! india wants home rule! india demands home rule!!}
<A>__{and the audience cheers him. newspaper cameramen crowded around the platform photograph him. patel comes forward from the back of the platform, clapping. he is chairing the congress. jinnah bows, taking his notes, gesturing to the auditorium. a man made for the spotlight, a man loving the spotlight. at last he moves back to his place on the platform. nehru clasps his hand in congratulation. others crowd around him. and fleetingly, just in the edge of picture, we see gandhi again, the only one in an indian tunic sitting at the end of the second row on the platform. he is just watching the flood of enthusiasm for jinnah. featuring patel approaching the microphone, stilling the house with upraised hands.}
<C>__{patel}
<D>__{and let no one question that mr. jinnah speaks not just for the muslims but for all india!}
<A>__{and again the audience cheers and applauds his little coda. he raises his hands, stilling them again.}
<C>__{patel}
<D>__{and now i'm going to introduce to you a man whose writings we are all becoming familiar with... a man who stood high in the esteem of our beloved professor gokhale... a man whose accomplishment in south africa will always be remembered. mr. mohandas gandhi.}
<A>__{gandhi has already started to come toward the podium. he is greeted with mild applause, but already the convention is performing like a convention now that the spell of jinnah's major speech has dissipated. as gandhi reaches the podium, patel gestures him to it.}
<C>__{patel}
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{your journal has made a great impact.}
<A>__{gandhi nods to him and acknowledges the residue of applause.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{i am flattered by mr. patel}
<P>__{(his grin.)}
<D>__{i would be even more flattered if what he said were true.}
<A>__{he means about the journal. patel has wandered back toward the others, his mind already on them. but he has half heard gandhi's comment and turns a smile, a politician's flexibility }
<C>__{patel}
<P>__{(loudly; he is away from the mike)}
<D>__{but it's true! i i read it... often.}
<A>__{again gandhi grins and takes glasses from his sleeve. this is the first time we have seen them. he has one slip of paper with notes on it which he has put on the podium. he puts his glasses on and faces the convention.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{since i returned from south africa, i have traveled over much of india. and i know i could travel many more years and still only see a small part of it.}
<A>__{on the platform, the whispered politics go on. on the floor of the convention, some listen, some talk of other things.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{...and yet already i know what we say here means nothing to the masses of our country.}
<A>__{nehru has turned, having caught that last remark. he touches patel on the shoulder "listen."}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{here we make speeches for each other and those english liberal magazines that may grant us a few lines.}
<A>__{and now they are beginning to pay attention on the floor of the hall too.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{but the people of india are untouched. their politics are confined to bread and salt.}
<A>__{jinnah too is listening now aloofly, challengingly.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{illiterate they may be, but they are not blind. they see no reason to give their loyalty to rich and powerful men who simply want to take over the role of the british in the name of freedom.}
<A>__{there is dissent on the floor and on the platform but it is muttered and english "polite." gandhi goes on.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{this congress tells the world it represents india. my brothers, india is seven hundred thousand "villages" not a few hundred lawyers in delhi and bombay. until we stand in the fields with the millions who toil each day under the hot sun, we will not represent india nor will we ever be able to challenge the british as one nation.}
<A>__{he takes off his glasses and folds them and in silence starts back toward his place on the platform. a cameraman flashes a picture, and someone begins to applaud; it is taken up here and there, tepidly. on the platform, the leaders join in perfunctorily. we see one peasant face (shukla) which we will come to know watching from the crowd of outsiders who stand in the doorways. nehru, who has been looking at gandhi with interest and some surprise turns to patel.}
<C>__{nehru}

<C>__{first friend}
<D>__{this can't be the way!}
<A>__{nehru is looking a little harassed, from the ragging he is taking and from the ride. the ashram is only half finished, the ground unworked, the buildings only partially completed and the whole looking like some primitive frontier outpost. they are finally brought to a halt by a goat that is tethered right across the path.}
<C>__{second friend}
<P>__{(a mocking quote)}
<D>__{yes, i'm sure this is the direction india is taking.}
<A>__{the others laugh; nehru suffers.}
<C>__{second friend}
<D>__{to think i almost got excited by mr. jinnah when all this was awaiting me.}
<A>__{ashram exterior day nehru has half risen in his seat to address charlie andrews, who, walking from one somnolent building to another, has stopped dead at the sight of the car. he carries sheaves of page proofs.}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{ah, you'll find him under the tree by the river.}

<A>__{ashram tree by river exterior day gandhi sits under a tree, peeling potatoes. nehru and his friends are sprawled out around him. beside them, the river; in the background the business of the ashram goes on.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{i try to live like an indian, as you see... it is stupid of course, because in our country it is the british who decide how an indian lives what he may buy, what he may sell. and from their luxury in the midst of our terrible poverty they instruct us on what is justice and what is sedition.}
<P>__{(he looks at them, a}
<D>__{teasing but mordant}

<C>__{nehru}
<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{if we have home rule that will change.}
<A>__{gandhi has finished the last potato. he glances at nehru then drops the potato in the bowl. he lifts the pail of peelings to nehru.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{would you, please?}
<A>__{nehru in his fine linen suit takes the pail awkwardly. his friends watch with amusement, but they too rise to follow as they head for the kitchen.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{and why should the english grant us home rule? here, we must take the peelings to the goats.}
<A>__{he re directs nehru toward a trough where two or three goats are tethered, but he keeps right on talking.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{we only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. we've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the british anywhere.}
<C>__{nehru}

<D>__{i thought you were against fighting.}
<A>__{they have reached the trough.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{just spread it around they like the new peelings mixed with the rotting ones.}
<A>__{nehru has carefully walked around something distasteful on the ground, now he dumps the peelings along the trough and spreads them "delicately." gandhi scoops some peelings from the trough to feed a goat that nudges him.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{where there is injustice, i've always believed in fighting.}
<P>__{(he looks at nehru.)}
<D>__{the question is do you fight to change things, or do you fight to punish.}
<P>__{(his smile.)}
<D>__{for myself, i have found that we are all such sinners we should leave punishment to god. and if we really want to change things there are better ways of doing it than by derailing trains or slashing someone with a sword.}
<A>__{he meets nehru's gaze, and for a moment something deeper than argument passes between them. then something catches gandhi's eye. he looks off. ba stands, watching him, waiting.}
<C>__{ba}
<D>__{the fire is ready.}
<A>__{gandhi turns. the goat is reaching for his bowl of potatoes. he pushes it away and starts for the kitchen.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{you see, even here we live under tyranny.}
<A>__{nehru grins, captured by gandhi's seriousness, and his humor. he hasn't moved, and neither have his friends. they watch gandhi as he carries his bowl of potatoes to ba.}
