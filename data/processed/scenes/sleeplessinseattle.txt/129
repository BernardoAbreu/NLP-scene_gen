<L>__{interior seattle tacoma airport day}
<A>__{jonah is standing out of the way at a departure gate, watching sam as victoria checks in for a flight bound for minneapolis.}
<C>__{victoria}
<P>__{(turning to jonah)}
<D>__{can i bring something back for you? a souvenir?}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{does he like those little snow scenes?}
<P>__{(to jonah)}
<D>__{you know you shake them up and the snow floats down?}
<A>__{sam looks at jonah, threateningly. be nice or else.}
<C>__{jonah}
<P>__{(extremely polite)}
<D>__{sure. i'd really like that. thank you so much.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{jonah}
<D>__{i think they're announcing your flight.}
<A>__{sure enough, passengers are starting to board.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he's ten.}
<C>__{victoria}
<P>__{(he's good at it)}
<D>__{he's good at it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i read an article about this ...}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{i read the same article...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it takes time }
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{absolutely. when i come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own. what do you think?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sure. sure.}
<A>__{victoria waves goodbye and starts toward the jetway. as sam watches her go, jonah looks at him, sticks his finger in his mouth and pretends to gag.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{jonah, this isn't fair. you don't know victoria. i hardly know her myself. she is, in fact, a mystery to me. she tosses her hair a lot. why does she do this? i have no idea. is it a twitch? does she need a haircut? should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? these are things that i'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why i am dating her. that is all i am doing. i am not marrying her. can you appreciate the difference? that's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit. but nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.}
<C>__{jonah}
<D>__{was mom an adjustment?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(complete exasperation)}
<D>__{i'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? what do you think? there's a perfect woman walking around out there?}
<A>__{at that moment, annie emerges from the jetway right next to the one victoria went into and comes toward us.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{there's no such thing as a perf }
<A>__{sam sees annie immediately, and is instantly struck by her looks, her fluidity, her poise. annie walks right toward sam, right past him, inches from him, not noticing him as she looks for the exit. sam continues to stare at her.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to himself, referring to annie)}
<D>__{god, she's beautiful.}
<C>__{jonah}
<P>__{(unaware he's talking about annie)}
<D>__{victoria? she's okay.}
<A>__{sam and jonah start toward the exit, sam trying not to lose sight of annie.}
<C>__{jonah}
<D>__{dad, i was talking to jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew annie in another life.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(completely distracted)}
<D>__{who is annie?}
<C>__{jonah}
<D>__{the one who wrote us.}
<A>__{sam is preoccupied with annie. she takes a turn that he doesn't expect. he's having trouble keeping up, because he has to wait for jonah.}
<C>__{jonah}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{but jessica says you and annie never got together in that life, and your hearts are like puzzles with parts out of them and when you get together the puzzle's complete.}
<A>__{he's lost annie in the crowd. she's nowhere in sight.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{god dammit.}
<A>__{a beat, then sam heads off to the exit. jonah follows. as they walk into the distance }
<C>__{jonah}
<D>__{the reason i know this and you don't is that i'm younger and purer so i'm more in touch with cosmic forces.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i sincerely hope you are not going to marry jessica.}
