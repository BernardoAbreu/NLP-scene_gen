<L>__{interior electra's car night}
<A>__{the red "low fuel" light is on.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{now what?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{turn off the engine.}
<A>__{electra twists the ignition and the car dies. rath glances around and we see the car is parked in a gas station.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{you want me to pump?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{no, stay in the car. i want you to understand something. if i intended to kill you, you would already be dead.}
<A>__{electra says nothing. he reaches over and takes the car keys. when he is out of the car, electra slowly releases the strangle hold she had on the steering wheel.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{okay, nikita, stay calm, think, breathe, think...}
<A>__{electra checks the rear view mirror, listening as rath pumps the gas. her eyes flash down to her bag. outside, rath watches electra through the windows. she appears motionless. the electric gas counter races like a stop watch. in the car, electra eases her hand into her bag. the tank full, rath re hangs the pump. he walks around the car and heads for the station. electra waits until his back is turned. she pulls her tool pouch from her bag, throws it open and finds her wire stripper. reaching under the dash, she yanks out a tangled handful of wire. she looks up; rath is inside paying.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{come on, come on, it's a cake walk.}
<A>__{her fingers fly with surgical precision, snipping, stripping, twisting. rath steps out of the station as her head pops up, looking for him. it takes only a second for him to realize what she is doing.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{oh shit.}
<A>__{he runs at the car as she strips the last set of wires and strikes them; the battery grinds.}
<C>__{electra}
<D>__{please, please.}
<A>__{he is almost there when the engine fires. she stomps on the gas, ramming the shift into drive. tires squealing, the car swerves forward as rath slams into it. he bounces backward, falling to the ground. the car fishtails away, accelerating as rath rolls to one knee, his gun automatically in his hand. he draws a bead, but, he does not shoot. with a concerted effort, he puts the gun away.}

<D>__{dammit.}
