<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{miranda opens her car door and walks down the empty street to retrieve her suddenly magical keys. we watch her reach the keys, all alone out here. the moment she bends down to pick it up she is blinded by the glare of headlight and the roar of an engine. miranda jumps out of the way, narrowly avoiding being flattened by a road sweeper, spraying water as it goes. she watches the truck disappear down the block. heart in her throat. calms her nerves and now walks over to the pesky keys again. smack in the middle of a puddle now. boom up the posts harnessing power lines which surround the area until we stop on a pair of industrial bolts fastened around the insulators of a thick power line. from here we see miranda bend down and pick up her keys. and now the bolts suddenly shake off their hinges, coming loose right in front of our eyes moved by some invisible force miranda tilts her head at the sound of a metallic snap and turns. the bolts pop out of their sockets. the live wire uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings straight towards the paralyzed miranda she looks down at her feet, ankle deep in the puddle, back up at the 11,000 volts of power about to fry her to a crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second. the wire hits the water and the monumental charge sends sparks flying in every direction. it looks like lightning. a silent, sudden beat. that was as close as close gets.}

<D>__{what do you want from me?}
<A>__{no sign of rachel. miranda yells at the air, glancing over her shoulder, seemingly demented:}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{what is it you want me to do?!!}
<A>__{a moment. miranda stranded. the stolen car in the middle of the road. and now the squeak of a gate opening abruptly. miranda whips her head in the direction of the sound. it's the front gate to her house. and now the front door swings open. and now the living room lights switch on. clearly rachel wants her back in the house.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i can't.}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{please, please don't make me go back in there.}
<A>__{but even as she's saying this her feet are moving towards it. she pauses, looks at the car in the middle of the road. looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost electrocuted. no neighbors have come out to investigate yet, but how long can that last? she walks to the car.}
