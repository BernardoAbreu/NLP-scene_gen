<A>__{barris and keeler wait in the car. colbert emerges from his house, alone, and walks toward the car. a drained barris sighs a sigh of relief, then suddenly and with unexpected force, keeler swings open the passenger door. the door hits a stunned colbert and sends him flying. keeler races around the car, grabs colbert, throws him into the back seat, and jumps on top of him. barris watches, surprised at the dramatic personality shift in keeler. keeler is strangling colbert. a cigarettes is dangling casually from his lips as he does this. keeler turns colbert over so he's facing him, so he can watch him die.}
