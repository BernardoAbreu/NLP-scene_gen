<L>__{interior emily's car night}
<A>__{the blue halflight before dawn. emily and lucy sit in the volvo, eyeing the scorched remains of the house. the firecrew stowing equipment. emily puts the car in drive.}
<L>__{interior emily's car dawn}
<A>__{the fish floating dead at the top of the tank in the back seat as emily drives down the freeway at daybreak. lucy gazing out dreamily at the sunrise.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{maybe we can find a hotel with a swimming pool.}
<A>__{emily says nothing. lucy turns and looks at her, thoughtful, almost empathetic. she draws up her knees and rests her chin on top, levels an appraising stare at emily like the one she leveled at doug.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{it's sad, isn't it? how it gets passed on. how people do to their own kids what their parents did to them. that's why you got the job...}
<A>__{emily turns on the radio, full volume, trying to drown out lucy's voice. lucy reaches over and turns it off. click.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{...to prove to yourself you're not like her, that you're not like your mother. because that scares you. scares you more than anything.}
<A>__{lucy, in mock sentiment, puts her hand on emily's.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i love you... even if you don't love me.}
<A>__{emily looks at her, gutted. but defiant. turning her gaze forward, she tightens her grip on the wheel and calmly, resolutely, jams the gas pedal to the floor. the acceleration pitches lucy backwards into her seat. she sits up, eyes wide, didn't see this coming. a suicide run.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{what are you doing? slow down.}
<A>__{a tense smile from lucy. the tables have turned.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{did you hear me?}
<A>__{emily stares dead ahead, red lining the tachometer. lucy flits her eyes skyward. immediately it darkens and starts to rain. emily turns on the wipers, speeds on, unfazed.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i said slow down!}
<A>__{emily ignores her, going eighty now, weaving through slower traffic that flies toward them out of the gray haze. lucy, panicking, changes channels like a tv. innocent child all of a sudden.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{please, stop, emily, i will be good.}
<A>__{emily ignores her, beyond apology. and lucy's face sharpens. she points down the road.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{through the heavy rain we see a tractor trailer rig crash through the dividing median and jackknife, barreling at them head on! emily goes for the brake, but reconsiders, seeing the truck for what it is: a test of faith. she welcomes it. tightens her grip on the wheel and goes full throttle again, right at the truck. lucy shrieks in terror.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{it's not real.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{yes, it is!}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{are you scared?!}
<A>__{pedal to the floor. inviting the head on collision. you can see the big rig driver in the cab, wrestling frantically with the steering wheel. lucy bracing herself, screams }
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{emily clenches her teeth in anticipation of impact, of death.}
<B>__{the chrome grillwork of the truck rushes toward them in that}
<A>__{final moment, the air horn deafeningly loud! but the impact never comes. in the blink of an eye the truck is gone. open road in front of them. it's not raining. never was. the wipers squeaking on a dry windshield. lucy sits in silence, her bag of tricks empty. emily, triumphant, turns to her with a vindictive smile, the speedometer hitting a hundred.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{are you scared?!}
<A>__{she clutches lucy's wrist.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i'm not!!}
<A>__{emily jerks the car off the road, crashing through the guardrail. trees snapping in half across the hood as they go careening through roadside woods and down a steep embankment}
<D>__{toward }
