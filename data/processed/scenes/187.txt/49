<L>__{interior trevor's hallway bathroom}
<A>__{as ellen steps into the doorway and lets out a startled gasp, dropping the box of baking soda. trevor is bent over, scrubbing his shirt in the sink. his bare back and shoulders are scattered with brutal knife scars.}
<L>__{exterior mother henry's after midnight}
<A>__{a tract house in the central san fernando valley. trevor's rambler is parked at the curb. the house is dark except for a porch light. trevor and ellen are greeted by ellen's golden retriever jack, who's chained to the front porch. jack whimpers, ready to bark.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{don't start barking, jack.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(petting him)}
<D>__{hey there, boy. you're a good dog. yes, you are.}
<A>__{jack nuzzles up to trevor, tail wagging furiously, no barking. now trevor stands and faces ellen...}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{sorry for reacting the way i did back there.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{don't apologize. that's how most people react.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{didn't scare me. it just surprised me.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{... thanks for dinner. i had a good time.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{awkward silence. trevor struggles with the urge to kiss her good night. they look at each other timidly for a moment. now he moves to kiss her and she inadvertently adjusts her stance. the result is a kiss that doesn't quite hit her mouth. it's an awkward moment. ellen feels horrible for him, desperately picks up a strange little plant by her feet.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{here... you need a little life in that place of yours.}
<A>__{trevor takes it, smiles "thanks"...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... good night.}
<A>__{... turns and starts toward his car...}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(a half wave)}
<D>__{... night.}
