<L>__{interior bag end living room night}
<A>__{frodo is preparing to leave.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{you'll have to leave the name of baggins behind you...for that name is not safe outside the shire. gandalf helps frodo into his coat.}
<C>__{gandalf }
<D>__{travel only by day and stay off the road.}
<C>__{frodo}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{i can cut across country easily enough.}
<A>__{gandalf looks at the young hobbit, moved by his courage.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{my dear frodo, hobbits really are amazing creatures. you can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet, after a hundred years, they can still surprise you.}
<A>__{suddenly! a sound from outside.}
<C>__{gandalf }
<D>__{get down!}
<A>__{gandalf freezes... he moves quietly towards the window, eyes wide with tension. he raises his staff above the window, and slams it down on the intruder. there is a yelp of pain! gandalf hauls a small figure into the room...sam gamgee sprawls across the floor! he looks up in terror as gandalf looms over him.}
<C>__{gandalf }
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{confound it all! samwise gamgee, have you been eavesdropping?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i ain't been dropping no eaves, sir! honest. i was just cutting the grass under the window there, if you follow me...}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{it's a little late for trimming the hedges, don't you think?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i heard raised voices...}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{what did you hear? speak!}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(panicked)}
<D>__{nothing important...that is, i heard a good deal about a ring...and a dark lord. and something about the end of the world, but...please, mr. gandalf, sir, don't hurt me! don't turn me into anything unnatural!}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{no?}
<B>__{frodo smiles}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{perhaps not. i've thought of a better use for you.}
