<L>__{interior apartment day}
<A>__{the hallway is a mess. a window opening onto a light well is open. the door to the apartment is suddenly broken open. a plain clothes detective, two uniformed police officers and several firemen also in uniform enter and look around. they all wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses. behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their way in. they're both holding their noses. in his free hand, the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional flyers. behind him, comes a female neighbor.}
<D>__{plain clothes detective}
<P>__{(to the superintendent and the neighbor)}
<D>__{wait outside please.}
<A>__{he signals to a police officer who herds the curious onlookers back out through the door.}
<C>__{police officer}
<P>__{(to the superintendent, pointing to a pile of mail)}
<D>__{what's the date of the last letter?}
<C>__{superintendent}
<P>__{(verifying)}
<D>__{the 16th from what i can see... wait...}
<A>__{the plain clothes detective has tried in vain to open the door on the left. it has been sealed up with adhesive tape.}
<D>__{plain clothes detective}
<P>__{(to the fire officer)}
<D>__{can you try?}
<A>__{while the firemen go to work on the door, the plain clothes detective goes into the adjoining dining room. he opens the windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via the double doors. they are locked and the gaps are also taped up. he turns to the right and goes into the living room, where he also opens up the windows...}
<C>__{fireman }
<D>__{the door is open.}
<A>__{...and comes back into the hallway, passing by the waiting firemen. once again, we hear snatches of dialogue between the police officer and the janitor.}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{...no as far as i know. during the whole time, they had a nurse, but it's been a while since i last saw her. my wife has been...}
<A>__{the plain clothes detective enters the bedroom which is now accessible. its windows are open and the draft makes the curtains billow into the room.}
<D>__{plain clothes detective}
<P>__{(to the firemen who are now curious enough to come and stand by the door)}
<D>__{did you open the windows?}
<A>__{the firemen shake their heads. the plain clothes detective turns toward the big double bed placed against the back wall of the bedroom. on the right hand bed, there's only the bare mattress. on the left hand bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman. where once there were eyes, now there are only gaping holes. the corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers that have already dried out a little. on her chest is a crucifix. white letters on a black background: the credits}
<L>__{interior concert hall night}
<A>__{all we see is the audience pouring into the hall. georges and anne, both are around eighty, are part of this crowd. they go to their seats in one of the rows near the front. once everybody is seated, we hear the usual announcement asking people to turn off their mobile phones. some people, caught with their phones switched on, hasten to comply. then the lights go out. applause. off screen, we hear the soloist make his entrance. throats are cleared here and there. finally, the music begins.}
<L>__{interior artists dressing room night}
<A>__{the music from scene 3 continues. the soloist is surrounded by admirers who congratulate him. now georges and anne push their way into the room. (if the soloist is female, they will be carrying flowers, like most of the others). when the soloist notices their presence, he leaves his group of fans, heads towards them and greets them very warmly, visibly glad to see them.}
<L>__{interior bus night}
<A>__{continuation of the music from scene 3. georges and anne are seated side by side in the half empty bus. anne talks enthusiastically, georges says something from time to time, and smiles now and then. they are both relaxed and happy.}
<L>__{interior apartment hallway night}
<A>__{the door to the apartment is unlocked and opened from the outside. the music ends. georges comes in, turns on the light. he and anne observe the open door. around the lock, one can see the traces of an attempted forced entry. georges bends down and runs his fingers over the deep grooves.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{they used a screwdriver or something like that...it doesn't look very professional...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but who would do something like that?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{no idea. why do people break in? because they want to steal something.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{from us?}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(laughs briefly out loud)}
<D>__{hey, why not? if i thought about it, i could come up with at least three or four people we know who've been burgled.}
<A>__{after having examined the outside of the second leaf of the double door, he comes in, closing the door behind him.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what time is it? can't we call the superintendent?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i will do that tomorrow morning. anyway, they didn't see anything.}
<A>__{he unbuttons his overcoat and heads toward the large closet in the hallway.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{don't let it spoil your good mood now.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{or the police?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{come on, give me your coat.}
<A>__{she goes toward him, he takes her coat off and hangs it with his in the closet.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{imagine if we were here, in our beds, and someone broke in.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{why should i imagine that?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but it's terrible! i think i'd die of fright.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{so would i.}
<A>__{he undoes his shoes.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{shall we have a drink?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i'm tired.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i still fancy a drink.}
<A>__{he puts away his shoes with the others and slips on his slippers. anne has gone into the bathroom.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{go ahead then. mathilde told me that in her building, the attic apartment was burgled from the loft. they just knocked a hole in the wall, cut out all of the valuable pictures from their frames and disappeared without a trace.}
<A>__{he goes toward the kitchen.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{they must have been professionals.}
<A>__{as he passes in front of the bathroom, he stops and appears to be looking at anne.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{did i tell you, you looked good tonight?}
<A>__{short pause. then:}
<C>__{anne }
<P>__{(flattered)}
<D>__{what's got into you?}
<A>__{with a gentle laugh, georges disappears into the kitchen, where he turns on the lights. we hear him fiddling around, apparently getting a glass and some wine. after a short}
<T>__{pause:}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{weren't those semiquavers in the presto incredible? what staccato! don't you agree?}
<A>__{short pause.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{you're proud of him, huh?}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{georges wakes up. he looks with amazement beside him, then raises his eyes. anne is sitting upright, her back against the headboard.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{something wrong?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{after a while, the ringing of a kitchen egg timer leads us to the next scene.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{the egg timer in the kitchen rings. georges is seated in front of the window, at a table which is half set for breakfast. he has mobile phone raised to his ear and a phone book opened in front of him. anne is getting up from the table. she goes toward the stove, turns off the gas, takes the egg out of the pan with a spoon and runs it under cold water. like georges, she is still in her robe.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(on the phone)}
<D>__{what about next week? no but still, it would make sense to get it done soon. it might give people silly ideas. and anyway, it's too ugly to look at... wednesday? what time? ok... will you bring the paint with you too, to paint over it? but at least some primer...yes, ok. thank you.}
<A>__{he hangs up.}
<C>__{georges }
<P>__{(to anne)}
<D>__{you can depend on that guy.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(who comes back to the table with the egg)}
<D>__{i hope so. the last time, he kept us waiting for ages, if you remember.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(laughs while acquiescing)}
<D>__{yes, that's true.}
<P>__{(reacting when she places the egg in his egg cup)}
<D>__{thanks. if i call a regular professional, we'll still be waiting two months time.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(more to herself)}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{she has sat down. looks straight ahead. he cracks open his egg, puts salt on it, eats.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{the frodons waited three days when their toilet was blocked. not exactly pleasant.}
<A>__{he eats. wants to put on more salt, but the saltcellar is empty.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{the saltcellar is empty.}
<A>__{he looks up for an instant, as if he expected her to deal with it. as she doesn't react, he realizes the inappropriateness of such an expectation, gets up himself, heads for the kitchen cupboards and fills the salt cellar.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{i don't know if he's going to bring us the cd. maybe he won't come at all. in any case, he didn't mention it. i'd like to buy it. it was really good and i don't want to wait long for it. we could go to virgin this afternoon and buy it. what do you say?}
<A>__{he comes back to the table and sits down again.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{hmmm? anne? what's the matter?}
<A>__{she looks at him and doesn't answer.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{what's going on? what's the matter?}
<A>__{he waves his hand in front of her eyes and laughs nervously.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{helllloooo!!! cuckoo!!! i'm here!}
<A>__{she continues to look at him without reacting.}
<C>__{georges }
<P>__{(serious now)}
<D>__{anne! what's going on?}
<A>__{he waits, looks at her. no reaction. he stands up slightly, leans over the table to sit beside her. tries to make her turn toward him.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{anne, what's the matter?}
<A>__{he manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him, but her eyes look through him.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{anne...what's...}
<A>__{he takes her face in both hands and turns toward him.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{anne...}
<A>__{she stares into the void. he drops his hands. then sits beside her, for quite awhile.}
<B>__{silence}
<A>__{finally he gets up, heads for the sink, turns on the tap, wets a tea towel, wrings it out a little, comes back and places it on anne's face. waits for a reaction that doesn't come. then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and applies the cloth there. then sits down and looks at her imploringly.}
<C>__{georges }
<P>__{(close to tears)}
<D>__{anne...darling...please!}
<A>__{once again they both remain seated. in the background, we hear the gushing of the tap that in his panic he has forgotten to turn it off. making a sudden decision, he gets up, rapidly crossing the hallway, he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress agitatedly, which takes him quite a lot of time. suddenly, the gushing of the tap stops, which had accompanied us as far as the bedroom. george doesn't notice it immediately, then he stops short.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{anne?}
<A>__{finally he returns, half dressed, into the kitchen. anne is seated in the same place and looks at him.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{she turns toward the breakfast.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{you left the water running.}
<A>__{georges stares at her.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(both aghast and furious)}
<D>__{hey, what's going on? are you completely crazy? is this supposed to be a joke, or what's going on?}
<A>__{she looks at him with amazement.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{is this a joke? is this meant to be a joke?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what joke? i don't get it! why are you talking to me like that? what's got into you?}
<A>__{georges comes from the door to the table.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{anne! please! stop this game. it's not funny.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(getting irritated)}
<D>__{what game, for christ's sake? what on earth's the matter?!!}
<A>__{georges is about to answer in a similarly irritated tone, but gradually begins to suspect that he could be mistaken. he tries to calm down, takes his chair that has remained beside anne, sits down and looks at his wife. she doesn't know how to react.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what's the matter? why didn't you react?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{to what?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{to what? to me, to everything.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{just now. a moment ago.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{please tell me what's wrong. what am i supposed to have done?}
<A>__{georges first looks away reluctantly, then looks at anne. he doesn't want to believe that its serious.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i don't know what to say. do you really not know what just happened?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but what did happen?}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(almost reluctantly bowing his head as he speaks)}
<D>__{you were sitting there, staring at me. you didn't answer me when i asked you what the matter was.}
<A>__{he picks up the wet tea towel from the table.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{i put this tea towel on your face, and you didn't react.}
<A>__{anne looks at the towel, then at georges, and shakes her head, perturbed that she can't understand. georges looks at her. he sees the damp marks on the collar of her robe.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{look... there's still dampness on your collar.}
<A>__{anne follows his gesture, tugs on her collar and sees the damp marks. she slowly grasps that something is awry.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{when... when was it?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{just now, a few minutes ago.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{so...??}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{there's no "so". i went into the bedroom to get dressed. i wanted to get help.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{help?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{yes, and then you turned off the tap.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{yes. because you left it on.}
<B>__{silence}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{neither do i.}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{don't you think it's best if i call dr. bertier?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{why? what can he do?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i don't know. examine you.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i'm fine. there's nothing wrong with me.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{anne, please!! that's absurd. we can't pretend that nothing happened.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but what did happen?}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{i'm here. i'm having my breakfast, and you're telling me things happened that i don't understand.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{can you explain how the tea towel got there?}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{no, i can't!}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{who turned on the tap?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you did!}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{can you remember that?}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(more and more desperate, close to tears)}
<D>__{no i can't! do you want to torture me? leave me in peace!}
<A>__{georges looks at her.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{don't you think it would be better to fetch dr. bertier?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she takes her cup of tea, as if to show how well she is, and drinks it up. when she wants to re fill her cup, she completely misses her aim. she notices it, puts down her cup and bursts into tears.}
<L>__{interior apartment night}
<B>__{silence}
<A>__{we see wide shots of the apartment. the hallway. the bedroom. the living room. the dining room. the kitchen. nobody in sight.}
<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{eva, around 50, has come to pay a visit. anne isn't there.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{you know how he is. once he's got something into his head, he has to go through with it. in the end, everybody was delighted. and besides, it didn't hurt our financial situation. we're playing until the 28th.}
<C>__{eva }
<D>__{then we have 10 days to rest, then we go to stockholm for four days, and then to kumo in finland. heaven knows where that is. at the north pole. but geoff's already been there few times, and he loves it. we're playing the "dowland transcriptions" there and then we're back in london.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what about the children?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{liz is at boarding school and john is living his own life. he's twenty six years old.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what does he do?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{he's a student. we rarely see him. he's got his own ideas. life geoff. they don't really get along. geoff wants to advise him on everything, and john doesn't like that at all.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{is he good?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i think so. he's less impulsive. very industrious.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{that sounds rather derogatory.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{no!! he's not like geoff. quiet, but stubborn. i think he'll do all right. at the last conservatory concert, he played the solo part in the haydn concerto. it was very good. geoff was there and congratulated him at the end.}
<A>__{brief pause.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{and you?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{did you both make up?}
<C>__{eva}
<P>__{(with a little laugh)}
<D>__{my god, you know him, don't you? over the winter, he suddenly discovered his passion for a viola player who'd been in our ensemble for years. what can i tell you? it was a huge drama, and the poor little darling wound up trying to commit suicide. that scared him and he came back to me in full remorse. i've got used to it now. what's a bit embarrassing is that the ensemble, you can't keep any secrets from anyone.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{do you love him?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{yes, i think so.}
<A>__{brief pause.}
<C>__{eva }
<D>__{what's aphasia?}
<A>__{georges gestures that it's too complicated.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what can i say? the carotid artery was blocked. they did an ultrasound scan, two in fact, and they said they had to operate on her. she was scared. she was confused and scared. you know she has always been afraid of doctors. they said the risk was very low and that if they didn't operate, she'd be certain to have a serious stroke.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{and what do they say now?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{just that it didn't go well. it's one of the 5% that go wrong.}
<A>__{he yawns.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{it's pretty upsetting.}
<A>__{he looks at his watch.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{usually at this time, i take a nap. my blood sugar is somewhere down in my socks.}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{yeah.}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{what can i do for you?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{nothing. it was nice of you to come despite all of your stress.}
<A>__{brief pause. she doesn't know what to say.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{no, really. there's nothing you can do. we'll see how things go when she's back here in the apartment. we'll manage. maybe i will get a caretaker in, or maybe i will manage on my own. we'll see. we've been through quite a lot in our time, your mother and i.}
<P>__{(little laugh)}
<D>__{all this is still a bit new.}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{eva}
<P>__{(with a little laugh)}
<D>__{it's funny. i don't know if i should say it. maybe it'll embarrass you. but when i came here a short while ago, i suddenly remembered how i always used to listen to the two of you making love when i was little.}
<C>__{eva }
<D>__{for me, at the time, it was reassuring. it gave me a feeling that you loved each other, and that we'd always be together.}
<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{a carpenter and his assistant are raising the base of the double bed. georges watches.}
<L>__{interior hallway living room day}
<A>__{the door of the apartment is opened. georges comes in. behind him is anne in a wheelchair, pushed by a paramedic. a second paramedic (as young as the finerst) follows with a suitcase and a large bag. behind them, the superintendent. georges tries to rid of the three as quickly as possible. he stuffs a twenty euro note into the hand of the first paramedic.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{here. thank you very much. it's for both of you. you can just put the things down here. there, beside the window, right. we'll be okay on our own. thanks a lot.}
<A>__{the two paramedics exchange a brief glance, say thanks, and leave the apartment, passing the superintendent as they go.}
<C>__{georges }
<P>__{(to the superintendent)}
<D>__{thank you, mr. mery.}
<C>__{superintendent}
<D>__{if you need anything, just call downstairs. if we can help at all...}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{right now everything's fine. i will let your wife know as soon as we need anything.}
<C>__{superintendent}
<P>__{(to anne)}
<D>__{it's nice to have you back, mrs. laurent.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{yes. thank you, mr. mery. thank you.}
<A>__{the superintendent hesitates another moment.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{yes, thanks.}
<C>__{superintendent}
<D>__{yes... so... goodbye then, ma'am. welcome home again. goodbye, sir.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{goodbye, mr. mery.}
<C>__{superintendent}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{he leaves the apartment. there is a brief moment of perplexity. then georges says:}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(with a nervous smile)}
<D>__{where do you want...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{in the living room.}
<A>__{georges pushes her toward the living room door, walks around the wheelchair, opens the door, comes back behind the wheelchair and pushes anne into the living room. the doorway is narrow. the wheelchair only just passes through it. georges pushes anne toward the sofa and the armchairs and then steps in front of her.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{shall i make some tea?}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(with a faint smile)}
<D>__{first come sit with me.}
<A>__{george registers her smile; he knows he's behaving in a clumsy way. he sits down in one of the two arm chairs.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{can you help me into the chair?}
<A>__{georges stands back up.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(eagerly)}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{he extends his hands. she puts on the wheelchair brake, lifts the footrest with her left foot, raises her right leg from the footrest with her left hand and then extends her left arm to georges.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{it's best if you put my arm around your neck and your right arm around me, that way it'll be easy.}
<A>__{he does as he is told, pulls her up as they hobble together the short distance to the second arm chair. cautiously, he lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight. because they are not used to it, the whole process appears awkward and clumsy.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he smiles because it seems silly to him to answer "don't mention it". then he sits down opposite her.}
<B>__{long pause.}
<A>__{at first they are both ill at ease, but then they accept the fact that words do not come easily. after a long while, during which we hear the intermittent sound of the traffic below.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(softly almost to himself)}
<D>__{i'm glad you're back.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(in a voice just as soft)}
<D>__{me too.}
<A>__{another pause. then anne says:}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{promise me one thing.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{please never take me back to the hospital.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what?}
<B>__{pause.}
<A>__{she looks at him. he has understood.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you promise?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{anne...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you promise?}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{anne, i...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{don't talk right now. and don't give me any lectures. please.}
<A>__{brief pause.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what can i say, it's...}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(interrupting him)}
<D>__{nothing. just don't say anything. ok?!}
<B>__{pause.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{he helps her into bed, then throws the blanket over her.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{there.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{thank you. thank you, darling.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{everything ok?}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(smiling)}

<D>__{ok.}

<D>__{so? how did he react?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{no idea. he probably found it amusing. i don't remember. i don't remember the film either. but i remember the feeling. that i was ashamed of crying, but that telling him the story made all my feelings and tears come back, almost more powerfully than when i was actually watching the film, and that i just couldn't stop.}

<C>__{anne}

<A>__{anne nods.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{why, anne?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i'd like to look at them.}
<A>__{georges hesitates, and doesn't understand the suddenness of this request.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{please!}
<A>__{he finally gets up and goes into the adjoining room. he comes back after a few moments with a stack of albums, pushes away the remains of anne's meal and sets down the first album in front of her.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(a bit irritated)}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{with her able hand, anne opens the album, looks at the photos, turns the pages, looks.}

<C>__{georges}
<D>__{hold on.}
<A>__{he sits her back on the bed and goes out of the room.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{i will be right back.}
<A>__{during this time, she remains seated, feeling embarrassed, and waits. he comes back with a towel and puts it on the seat of the wheelchair.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{it's no big deal. come on.}
<A>__{he lifts her out of the bed into the wheelchair and pushes her through the hallway into the bathroom. he lifts her out of the wheelchair, sits her on the stool and takes off her wet nightgown, pulling it over her head. she starts to sob inconsolably. he caresses her face.}

<D>__{... thinking about whether it wouldn't be better to invest the money in an apartment block. if inflation gets going again, property is the only sure thing. right now, savings accounts pay 1.75% at best. four years ago, geoff bought some stocks with a small sum of money and the whole thing collapsed. so now we're obviously worried. unfortunately, in the meantime, other people have had the same idea, and property prices are going through the roof. since we came back from scandinavia, i spend all my spare time looking through newspaper ads.}
<A>__{to put an end to the pause that follows, she adds:}
<C>__{eva }
<D>__{it takes time, that's all. we'll find something in the end.}

<C>__{georges}
<D>__{anne?}
<A>__{geoff nods. georges shrugs.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{it's hard to say. sometimes i get the feeling she's totally unaware of the state she's in. and then i feel the opposite. it's... i don't know.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{and what about the doctor? what does he say?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{he's...}

<C>__{eva}
<D>__{nothing is ok.}
<A>__{at first he's vexed by her brusque response, but then goes to sit down on the sofa. meanwhile, eva turns to georges:}
<C>__{eva }
<D>__{what's going on, actually? you can't just leave her lying on her bed like that! she's unrecognizable! it's ridiculous!}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{we can't do anything for the moment. calm down, darling. she's getting medical treatment, they give her the necessary medication, and there are no other options right now.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{what does that mean, "no other options"? why isn't she in a hospital?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{she had a second stroke. bertier examined her and felt we could spare her all the hospital inpatient procedures.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{anyway, they wouldn't keep her, they'd send her to a care home. what they do in those places, we can do here.}
<A>__{eva looks at him, amazed.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{and she won't be put in a care home. i promised her that.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{don't you think you're taking on too much?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{have you got a better idea?}
<A>__{geoff doesn't know what to say. eva has composed herself somewhat and blows her nose.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i can't believe that these days there's no way of handling this efficiently.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(curtly)}
<D>__{no one's stopping you from finding out.}
<A>__{eva gets up, furious, and goes to the window. georges follows her with his eyes.}

<D>__{believe me, i love your mother as much as you do. so please, don't treat me as if i was a total idiot incapable of doing the obvious.}
<C>__{eva}

<C>__{geoff}
<P>__{(to georges)}
<D>__{don't you want to get a second opinion?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{now you two had better stop, ok? another doctor did come. he said bertier was right. from monday, a nurse will come three times a week. now can we talk about something else?}

<D>__{like what?}
<L>__{interior kitchen night}

<A>__{anne is at the piano and plays the piece from the scene 3. we watch her and listen to her for a while. georges is seated in his armchair and looks at the piano. finally he leans over toward the cd player and stops it. the music suddenly stops. georges remains silently seated.}

<A>__{he prepares a bowl of muesli, fills a sipping cup with water and brings both into the bedroom. sits down on the bed close to anne to feed her her food.}

<C>__{anne}
<D>__{ok...}
<A>__{he begins to feed her.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i added a little orange juice. i find it tastes quite good.}
<A>__{she can only swallow slowly, and so something keeps running back out of her mouth. he wipes it with a tea towel, continues to feed her. finally, after a few mouthfuls, she keeps her mouth shut.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{come on, anne, you have to eat some more. you've only swallowed three mouthfuls.}
<A>__{anne continues to keep her lips sealed.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{please, darling. a bit more.}
<A>__{anne doesn't move. he puts the muesli on the night stand and holds the sipping cup to her lips. she drinks slowly, one sip after the other. he pulls the cup back between each sip, to give her more time. suddenly she says:}

<D>__{...mom to the concert...}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{...mom to the concert... no dress...}

<D>__{... we could take turns. she'd come from 8 till 12 and i'd do 2 until 6, or 3 to 7. that would certainly relieve the pressure on you.}

<D>__{i will think about it.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{she just has to know in time so she can arrange it in her schedule.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{yes, of course, i will let you know in the next few days.}

<D>__{thanks for the coffee.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{my pleasure. i will see you out.}
<A>__{they both leave the kitchen. as the nurse, in the hallway, takes her jacket off the hook in the closet and puts it on, she comments on anne's continuing calls for help.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{you mustn't take it too seriously. usually they always say something. she might just as well say "mom, mom, mom". it's just mechanical.}

<D>__{no. let's stop this conversation right there. i'm taking care of your mother. it's a full time job. and i'm not saying that to complain, just to explain why i didn't answer your phone calls and why i don't want to have any pointless discussions on the subject. your mother is just as could have been expected: bad the whole time.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{she is turning more and more into a helpless child, and it's sad and humiliating, for her and for me. and she doesn't want to be seen in that state either. even the last time you visited, she didn't want you to come. you two have your own life. nothing wrong with that. but let us have our life too. even though it's a lousy one. ok?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{dad, what's the matter?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{nothing's the matter; your visit caught me by surprise. and i'm annoyed that you show up here to check that everything's ok. who do you think you are?}
<A>__{pause. eva is speechless.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i...}
<A>__{then she gets up and makes to go to the door.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{stay here, will you!}
<A>__{she stops short, looks at him.}
<C>__{georges }
<P>__{(softly, but insistently)}
<D>__{please!}
<A>__{she hesitates a moment, but winds up leaving the living room.}
<B>__{we hear her pass in the hallway to go into the bedroom and her vain attempt to open the door.}
<C>__{eva }
<D>__{mom? ... mom??}
<A>__{georges remains seated, motionless, until she comes back. she seems upset by the situation, as one would expect.}
<C>__{eva }
<D>__{tell me, what's going on? have you gone crazy?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{please, sit down.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i don't want to sit down. what's going on here?}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{nothing's going on. i want to spare us all a pointless drama. i presume your mother is asleep. she mostly sleeps the whole day. and then she wakes up at night. if you really want to, we'll go and see her in a little while. now, sit down. ok?}
<A>__{they look at each other. reluctantly, eva heads toward her armchair and sits down. pause. then georges goes on in a quiet voice:}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{we do our speech exercises every day, or we sing together. most of the time, i wake up around 5. at that time, she's still awake. then we change her incontinence pad. i rub cream on her to avoid sores. then, around 7, i try to persuade her to eat and drink. sometimes it works, sometimes not. sometimes she tells me things from her childhood, then for hours she calls for help, and then an instant later she's giggling away to herself, or crying. nothing of any of that is worth showing to anyone.}
<A>__{silence. eva looks down. finally, she says:}
<C>__{eva}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you can't stop me from seeing her.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(also softly)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{they remain seated for a moment, finally eva gets up. georges follows her into the hallway. he unlocks the door and they enter the bedroom. the bright light from outside filters through the blinds. eva goes over to the bed, looks at anne. finally, she caresses her face, shyly and clumsily. anne opens her eyes. looks at her. no movement.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{it's me, mom.}
<A>__{anne emits a furious sound.}
<C>__{eva }
<P>__{(helpless)}
<D>__{can i do something for you? mom...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{mom... mom... mom... mom... mom...}
<B>__{silence.}
<A>__{georges has remained by the door. after a while, they both leave the bedroom, cross the hallway to come back in the living room. georges closes the door. for an instant he puts a consoling hand on eva's shoulder. then he sits down. eva, trying to compose herself, goes toward the window and looks outside. suddenly she starts sobbing. after a while, georges gets up and goes out of the room. eva, vexed, blows her nose. shortly after, georges comes back. he has another teacup in his hand, puts it down beside his on the table and sits down.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{the tea isn't very hot any more.}
<A>__{eva turns toward him.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{but it does make you feel better.}
<A>__{after a short pause, eva comes toward the table. sits down. he fills her cup.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{she takes the cup, drinks. replaces it. still can't bring herself to look at him.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{it was silly of me to lock the door. i'm sorry. you took me by surprise, that's all. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{she nods her head, indicating she understands. finally she looks at him:}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{what's going to happen now?}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(with a little ironic laugh)}
<D>__{what's going to happen now? the nurse comes twice a week, and every two weeks dr. bertier and the hairdresser come. that's what you want to know, right? things will go on as they have done up until now. they'll go from bad to worse. things will go on, and then one day it will all be over.}
<A>__{brief pause.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{you can't go on like this, dad.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{can't i? what do you suggest?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{can't we have a serious talk, you and me?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what do you call "a serious talk"? what do you want to suggest? do you want to have mom live with you? do you want to pack her off to a care home? do you? what do you want? go on, talk to me "seriously"!}
<A>__{eva looks at him.}
<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{georges is seated on the bed beside anne, who is still bedridden.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(in a rush)}
<D>__{... short... short dress... only i... only i... all long... it was... (with a small gesture to imitate a bell): ding... dong...}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{yes, it swung to and fro.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(still rushed)}
<D>__{... yes... to ... fro ... you... very serious... like that... (she imitates a serious countenance, continues in a low voice): like that... serious...}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(unable to keep from laughing a little)}
<D>__{yes. i think i was pretty uptight.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{yes... up... tight...}
<A>__{pause. anne puts her hand on georges'.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{... it was n...nice...}
<B>__{silence.}
<L>__{interior bathroom hallway bedroom day}
<A>__{georges is shaving. suddenly we hear, coming from the bedroom,}
<C>__{anne's voice}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{help... help... help... help... help...}
<A>__{georges wipes his face and, to the sound of anne's cries, crosses the hallway and enters the bedroom. anne continues to cry out in a monotone to herself. georges goes over to her bed.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(trying to calm her like a sick child)}
<D>__{what is it?..}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{are you in pain?... what's the matter?... is your pad full?}
<A>__{he raises her blanket for an instant and sniffs, then replaces it.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{no... so what's hurting you?}
<A>__{he sits down beside her on the bed. takes her hand.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{it's all right... it's all right ... i'm here... everything's fine... we'll... hold on, i will tell you a story... but you must be quiet, i can't talk too loud, it wears me out... here we go: when i was little... well, i wasn't as little as all that... it was toward the end of primary school, so i was about ten, dad and mom sent me to a holiday camp. they thought it would do me good to spend the summer with kids my own age... we were lodged in an old castle in the midst of a magnificent wooded landscape... i think it was in the auvergne... i don't know... in any case it was the opposite of what i'd expected... we had to get up at 6 and go for a morning swim. not far from the castle, there was a pond fed by an icy mountain stream. we entered it running, in a double file. you know, i was never very sporty. they had a program to keep us on the go all day, probably to nip any potential pubescent impulses in the bud ... but the worst thing was the food. the third day after our arrival, there was rice pudding for lunch. i hate rice pudding. we sat at long tables in a huge hall. i didn't want to eat the stuff and the housemaster said to me: you won't get up until you've cleared your plate. so after the meal everybody left the room, and i remained seated, in tears. i had made a secret pact with mom. i was to send her a postcard every week.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{if i was pleased with the place i was to draw some flowers on it, or if not, some stars. she kept the card; it was covered all over in stars. after three hours, i was allowed to leave the table. i went up to my room, got into bed and had a fever of 42 degrees. it was diphtheria. they took me to the nearest hospital where i was put in an isolation ward, which meant that mom, when she came to visit me, could only wave at me through a window. at some point i lost that postcard. it's a pity.}
<A>__{anne has become ever calmer during georges' story. he still holds her hand.}
<B>__{long silence.}
<A>__{then georges reaches across anne's body to get hold of his pillow and presses it over her face. stifled sounds from anne. everything that can still move in her body starts to move. georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it with his whole weight, for a long time, until all anne's movements stop. then he sits up, exhausted, and without removing the pillow from her face, remains seated beside her.}
<B>__{silence.}
<L>__{interior hallway kitchen day}
<A>__{hallway. the front door of the apartment is unlocked. georges, in city clothes, enters with two big shopping bags full of cut flowers. he puts down the bags, takes off his coat, hangs it in the closet. the telephone rings. georges takes the bags and carries them in the kitchen, puts them in the sink, fills it with water. he starts to cut the stems and put the flowers in the water. we watch him doing so for a while. meanwhile, the telephone}
<B>__{has stopped ringing.}
<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{georges has opened one of the sections of the large wall closet. he is looking for a specific dress. he takes some out, puts them back inside. one of the dresses slips off its hanger and falls to the floor. he picks it up, hangs it up again. he ends up finding the one he was looking for. he takes it out on its hanger. closes the closet again. looks at the dress. then he lowers his arm a little and is about to leave the bedroom. he catches his feet in the dress. he just saves himself from tripping up by grabbing on to the wheelchair that is parked there. exhausted, he flops down into it.}
<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{with wide adhesive tape, georges seals up the door frame of the bedroom.}
<L>__{interior kitchen adjoining bedroom hallway day}
<A>__{georges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast with anne in scene 8, and writes a letter. pauses for reflection. gentle cooing of pigeons, scarcely audible. suddenly, georges starts. at the far end of the long kitchen, beside the door between the kitchen units, a pigeon is walking. georges stares at it. for a long time. then he gets up slowly and, via the door located beside the kitchen table, he goes into the adjoining room. on the sofa there, he has set up his new bed. he takes the wool blanket from the bed and comes back into the kitchen, carefully approaches the pigeon that then runs off in alarm. georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it over the pigeon. but it manages to escape into the hallway. georges follows it. this action is repeated several times. the pigeon is more and more panicky, starts to fly up, flutters about in all directions. georges closes the light well window to cut off its escape route. this lasts an exhausting amount of time, but he ends up capturing it. he cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby.}
<L>__{interior adjoining room kitchen night}
<A>__{from the adjoining room, we see georges seated at the kitchen table, writing. finally we see what he is writing: ... you won't believe it. a pigeon came in, for the second time already, through the light well. this time i caught it. in fact it wasn't difficult at all. but i set it free again. i'm going to ...}
<L>__{interior adjoining room kitchen hallway day}
<A>__{georges is lying on his bed in the adjoining room, staring at the ceiling. o.s., we faintly hear the sound of running water, and from time to time the clattering of dishes. after a while, georges gets up and goes into the kitchen. he remains in the doorway and watches anne who, doing the dishes, at first doesn't pay attention to him, then notices his presence and shoots him a quick glance, saying casually:}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i'm almost done.}
<A>__{georges continues to look at her unwaveringly.}
<C>__{anne's voice}
<D>__{you can put your shoes on if you want.}
<A>__{georges looks at her an instant longer, passes beside her, goes into the hallway, sits down on a stool beside the closet and puts on his shoes. o.s. we hear anne finishing her work. she comes out, hangs up her apron in the closet, disappears for a few moments into the bathroom. meanwhile, georges has got up, and looks in the bathroom where, clearly, anne is tidying her hair and sprucing herself up. when she comes out again, he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it on.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{they head for the front door.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{aren't you taking a coat?}
<A>__{georges thinks a few seconds, then takes his trench coat from the hook and they leave the apartment.}
<L>__{interior hallway bedroom dining room living room}
<D>__{ day}
<A>__{four long shots: all the windows are open. the sun is shining. it is fairly bright. hallway. silence. then the sound of a lock being opened. eva comes into the apartment. remains a long time beside the door. looks around her, ill at ease. finally she hesitantly goes into the bedroom. anne's twin bed isn't there any more. on georges' bed lies only the bare mattress. eva remains there a moment, then goes through the partition door into the dining room. there, everything is as usual. eva continues into the living room. there too, everything is as usual. eva stops by the piano stool. looks out of the window, feeling at a loss. then she heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner. on the table lie the remains of a snack. eva looks at the table, turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear street noise. then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the armchairs. her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room. end credits (white on a black background)}
