<L>__{interior exterior city bus (moving) sara and patrick night}
<A>__{dressed to the nines. they look happy and relaxed, more so than we've ever seen. they sit close to each other. very close.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{are you gonna tell me where we're going?}
<P>__{(as he grins, shakes his head)}
<D>__{why is the surprise for me? you're the one with something to celebrate.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{we can celebrate together.}
<A>__{she looks at him. can't find any words. so she just goes into her evening bag and pulls out a small box. she hands it to him, a little nervous about how it will be received.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i wanted to get you something and i couldn't figure out what. it's not much but i hope you like it.}
<A>__{patrick opens the box. removes a key chain. it's engraved with the medical emblem (snake & staff, etc.). he regards her, touched.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i like it. i love it. thank you.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{wait. there's more.}
<A>__{she leans in, turns the key chain over in his hand. the back side of it is engraved with the words, "patrick reynolds, m.d." patrick locks eyes with sara, lifts her hand to his lips. kisses it softly. the gesture is succinct but alluring and, for a brief moment, they're the only two people in the world.}
