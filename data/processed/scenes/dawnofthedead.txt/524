<A>__{the lock clicks just as one bold creature grabs stephen from behind, fran tries to aim her torch closer. it disarms the zombie for a moment, stephen thrashes his body back knocking the think off balance. then he quickly slides the keys under the gate which he can lift just high enough with the single lock undone. another ghoul grabs steve from behind. this time steve's torch is knocked flying and rolls away. fran is desperate. she tries to aim her pistol but cannot shoot through the grill. she holds her torch high. steve kicks and scrambles, rolling on the floor. the zombies are on him. he manages to knock one or two of them to the floor. then he fires with his pistol, killing another, he crawls to the torch and grabs it, the creatures clutching and tugging at his pants and shirt. he brings the flame up and flashes it at the zombies. they back away enough for him to crawl to an open space. then he scrambles to his feet and charges down the concourse toward the car.}
