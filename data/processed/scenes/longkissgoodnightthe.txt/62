<B>__{back with timothy}
<A>__{watching them go. oh, well. he tried, right...? did his best, tomorrow's another day without missing a beat, timothy walks out in the middle of the road. another car, coming. sports car. he snaps in a fresh clip. raises his fist and pumps one through the fast approaching windshield. kills the driver. the car throws a skid. slewing sideways at him. onrushing juggernaut, immense...! he vaults the hood without breaking stride. catches the drive side doorhandle, jerks then he's in, and out comes the corpse and the car never stops moving. completes an out of control 360, showering muddy water... and then he's stomping the gas. utterly relentless. leaving behind a wet and very surprised looking corpse.}
