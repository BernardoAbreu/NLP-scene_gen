<L>__{ext day: villa courtyard}
<A>__{there is the car, with appolonia sitting in the driver's seat, playing with the wheel like a child. calo moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear seat. then michael seems disturbed. over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees fabrizzio disappear through the gate.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(muttering to himself)}
<D>__{where the hell is he going?}
<A>__{michael goes down the hallway, and outside. michael steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes. appolonia sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay where he is.}
<C>__{appolonia}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{i will drive to you.}
<A>__{he smiles affectionately. calo stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling by his side. there is no sight of fabrizzio. suddenly the smile fades from michael's face. he steps forward and holds out his hand.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no. no!}
<A>__{his shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous explosion, as she switched on the ignition. part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off; and there is nothing left of the alpha, or of appolonia. michael is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.}
