<A>__{booming up and over the fence, the yard is a veritable maze of old, rusted cars, piled up helter skelter, frozen in time. broken glass, mangled engine parts, garbage and litter... along with hundreds of spent shell casings, are scattered in the dirt. a caravan of utility vehicles roars in behind the semi, the convoy making a bead for the center of the yard. picking up the rear is a black rolls royce phantom ii. as they turn the last corner, the first thing we see are "unearthly" flares. dozens of them, bright as hell, lighting up the middle of the graveyard. the cars come skidding to a stop. dust swirls.}
