<L>__{exterior khor khalba city entrance day}
<A>__{conan and tamara walk through the town's teeming market, a otherworldly bazaar replete with animal sacrifices, veiled faces and not a hint of morality.}
<B>__{stranger}
<A>__{a figure, his form hidden beneath a cloak, spots conan and tamara as they enter, and begins to follow them.}
<B>__{wooden platform}
<A>__{the city ends at the sheer cliff wall at the bottom of the plateau. there stands a wooden platform that is lowered by a massive winch, unloading a cavalry regiment and then raising back up to the fortress above.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{it's probably only way into khalar's fortress. i'm sure it is heavily guarded at all times, day and night.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{so we must try to scale the cliff.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{and dodge arrows as we do so?}
<A>__{conan motions up to the winch. standing beside it are a half dozen of the four armed archers.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{during the day, we'd easily be spotted on the climb. and it would be useless to even attempt at night. no, we must find another way.}
<C>__{stranger's pov}
<A>__{as conan continues around the base of the mesa, the figure following conan is joined by two others.}
<B>__{alleyway}
<A>__{conan and tamara reach a less crowded area of the village when a voice rings out behind them.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{halt.}
<A>__{conan spins, sword at the ready. from out of the shadows comes a pair of men, their beady eyes fixed on tamara.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{thieves. you'll regret finding me.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{i think not.}
<A>__{from out of the shadows steps the one eyed thief, the same one who conan saved from lucius' beatings. he smiles at conan, lifting a key from a rope around his neck}
<C>__{one eyed thief}
<D>__{it took longer than you think to cut this out of lucius' stomach. after all that work, i figured i'd keep it for old times' sake.}
