<L>__{interior gardner house dining room later}
<A>__{a faux tudor hancock park dining room. wealthy, but lived in. judge lewis gardner, your basic henry fonda jimmy stewart type patriarch, carves a turkey at the head of a long table, wearing a worn and gravy splattered apron. platters circulate in both directions among nikki's older siblings (burton and sandra), their spouses, their children. willy sits next to nikki, who is high stylish despite the fact that she's dressed "casual."}
<C>__{gardner}
<D>__{white or dark, willy?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{anything is fine, your honor.}
<C>__{gardner}
<D>__{i'm off duty, you can call me lew.}
<A>__{while gardner piles turkey on a plate and passes it:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{so is everyone in this family involved in the law?}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{well, nikki's not.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{ha ha.}
<P>__{(to willy:)}
<D>__{burton's a counsel for sierra club, and sandra's aclu so they use the holidays as an opportunity to give me a hard time, because i can buy and sell them.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{we're not actually for sale, nick.}
<A>__{nikki gives willy a did i tell you? look.}
<C>__{gardner}
<D>__{nicole decided early on that black sheep was the most effective role in which to distinguish herself from her siblings.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{you know of any other family in america where the corporate lawyer who's going to make partner by thirty five is the "black sheep"?}
<C>__{gardner}
<D>__{well you may be lost beyond recovery, but maybe we can still convince willy that defending giant corporations against injured citizens is not the best use of his skills.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i don't think so, sir.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{it's where the money is.}
<C>__{gardner}
<P>__{(scolding mildly)}
<D>__{i believe that phrase refers to banks. and it was coined by a thief.}
<A>__{beat. willy remains polite, but won't back down.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{times have changed.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(to willy)}
<D>__{you don't have to do this.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i don't mind; i get this kind of thing now and then.}
<P>__{(to gardner)}
<D>__{almost always from people with money.}
<C>__{gardner}
<D>__{appearances can be deceiving, willy. i grew up with eight brothers and sisters on a farm up in fresno, and i promise you i saw my share of hard times.}
<A>__{willy considers his options.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{my mom od'd fairly frequently, so they put me in a group home. my younger sister is dead and my older brother is doing twenty five to life.}
<A>__{awkward silence.}
<C>__{gardner}
<D>__{you win.}
<A>__{beat. willy looks down, begins to eat again.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i usually do.}
<C>__{gardner}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{yes. i see that.}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{i don't know if you will against the wife shooter, though.}
<A>__{the click of silverware.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{whoops.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{nice, burton.}
<A>__{beat. willy looks up at burton, steady. shrugs.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{it's not over 'til it's over.}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{that looked pretty over.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{anyway, willy's been taken off the case.}
<C>__{gardner}
<D>__{it might not seem like it now, but that's a blessing in disguise, willy.}
<A>__{willy nods. beat. to nikki, uncomfortable:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i wasn't.}
<A>__{nikki looks at willy.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{taken off.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{that...doesn't make any sense. lobruto has to do some kind of damage control }
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i asked him not to.}
<A>__{silence. nikki is staring at him. angry.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{you are really stupid, did you know that?}
<A>__{willy doesn't know how to handle this; everyone else tries to be polite, eating and pretending not to notice.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i'm getting new evidence }
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{where? the evidence store?! oh, that's right they open early the day after thanksgiving. you're gonna be fine!}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{did it ever occur to you i might be good enough to still win?!}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{who cares?! win what?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{the man shot his }
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{you wanted corporate, right?! you wanted to play in the big leagues?!}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{yeah, i'm just }
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{you go to all that trouble getting yourself in and then you just pay no attention to wh }
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{look i'm sorry can we not talk about this here?!}
<A>__{nikki stops. refusing to look around. ashamed at losing control, turns back to her food:}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{everyone eats in silence a moment then nikki tosses down her napkin:}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i need to talk with you.}
<A>__{she gets up and walks out of the room. with an awkward glance around, willy excuses himself and follows her.}
