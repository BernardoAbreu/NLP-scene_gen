<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior bal tabarin ball room later that night}
<A>__{a festive parisian night spot. dance music plays while a floor show, lit by moving spotlights, unfurls in the huge, darkened ballroom which is ringed with crowded tables. a handsome male dancer, in tuxedo and top hat, whirls exuberantly around the floor, surrounded by beautiful chorus girls. somewhere above all this, nikki, lit by spotlight flashes, sits on the edge of a ringside balcony observing the show with eager interest through her lorgnette. the show continues: after a few twirls, the dancer links arms with the girls to form a line and do some precision high kicking. the music continues but the dance apparently ends and the lights come up. impressed, nikki is breathless.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{my, my! isn't this nice?!}
<A>__{nearby, the men sit at a roped off table for six on a low balcony. cary and francis sit glumly on one side of the table as bill tries to tell a story to the others (frink; a nameless young woman nicknamed "kiss me quick" who appears in this scene only; shep and nikki).}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{now, listen, men. i will tell ya something funny.}
<A>__{cary and francis look doubtful about this. bill sits at the table.}

<D>__{and she sat right across the table in front of me. and i said, "auntie i can see your knees!"}
<A>__{nobody laughs or even changes expression.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(pointedly, after an awkward pause)}
<D>__{i wonder what's doing in portugal tonight.}
<A>__{bill is disappointed at the response.}
<C>__{bill}

<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i will send you a photograph of my poetry.}
<A>__{cary gives her a look, then rises and peers with one eye into the open bottle of champagne on the table between him and nikki. he gestures at the bottle as he sits back down.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{say, i wonder if there's anything intoxicating in that.}
<A>__{everybody cracks up except nikki, who looks a little hurt. an empty champagne bottle is placed on the floor.}
