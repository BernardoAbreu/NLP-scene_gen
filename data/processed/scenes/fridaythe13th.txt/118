<C>__{alice }
<D>__{help!}
<A>__{bill doesn't hesitate. carrying his machete, he runs to alice's cabin. marcie and jack follow in the bg.}

<A>__{alice is backed against the wall. the snake could strike and get her. bill runs into the room, still carrying his machete. he looks at alice.}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(a tight whisper)}
<D>__{there's a fucking snake in here.}
<A>__{bill sees it. he freezes, then takes a step forward. carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the machete, cutting the snake into two pieces. blood spurts onto the floor. marcie and jack enter. jack carries a shovel as a weapon. marcie stops when she sees the embrace, but then looks further to see the blood and guts.}
<C>__{marcie}
<D>__{steve never mentioned serpents. jack, would you get some paper towels?}
<A>__{jack nods and exits.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{how the... did he get in there?}

<D>__{slipped in. probably liked the scent of your perfume.}
<A>__{jack return and tosses a roll to marcie.}
<C>__{marcie}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you okay now?}
<A>__{alice nods. bill gives her an extra hug. then steps back awkwardly, stepping on marcie's big toe.}
<C>__{marcie}
<D>__{go ahead. i walk on 'em all the time.}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{would you shovel mr. snake outta here?}
<A>__{jack nods. he picks up his shovel and we see in cu as he gets underneath the wide fanged snake. marcie begins to clean the blood off the floor with the paper toweling.}
