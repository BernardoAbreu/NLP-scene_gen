<L>__{interior rebecca's house late afternoon}
<A>__{rebecca opens the door. a tired looking dulaney enters. they walk to the couch together in silence. dulaney sits. rebecca lifts a bottle of champagne out of an ice bucket.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{what's that for?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{to celebrate how masterfully you destroyed roston today.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{rebecca we shattered a man's life in open court.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(suddenly ice cold)}
<D>__{fuck him! he tried to shatter mine.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{he was only doing what he thought was right.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{you're too weak, frank. when you want something you have to do what ever it takes to get it. if something gets in your way you remove it.}
<A>__{dulaney stares at her. the person he sees has no feelings no empathy for anyone.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you killed him didn't you?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i knew you were thinking that. i could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom. you're wrong, frank. i need you to believe that.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you don't need anybody.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i do need you. no matter what you think of me i didn't do it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i could see the looks on the juror's faces. to the men i represent what they can never have. i'm a cold, heartless bitch and this is their chance for pay back for every woman that's ever blown them off in a bar. to the old women i'm a vulgar whore and to the young ones i remind them of what they'll never be. it doesn't matter to them that i'm innocent. they've already convicted me.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i'm dropping the case.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(matter of factly)}
<D>__{no you're not.}
<A>__{rebecca picks up a remote control from the coffee table and pushes a button.}
<B>__{close on television}
<A>__{a tape of dulaney making love to rebecca fills the screen. it is wild, passionate.}
<B>__{close on dulaney}
<A>__{he is dumbfounded as he watches. the implications of what this tape could do to him run through his mind. something in dulaney snaps. he grabs rebecca. they struggle, falling down onto the coffee table. the champagne bottle crashes to the floor. rebecca rolls off the table to the floor. she sits up and moves away from dulaney by pushing herself backwards. dulaney lunges at her. his hand grabbing her ankle. rebecca kicks breaks free stands up. dulaney gets to his feet runs after her. he grabs her by the throat and smashes her into the wall. he slaps her across the face. a thin stream of blood flows from the corner of her mouth. she smiles.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{it gets easier, doesn't it? once you open the door it never closes.}
<A>__{dulaney realizes what he is doing. he stares at her in horror, then walks towards the door. he stops. goes back to the vhs machine. he pushes the eject button on the vcr, removes the tape and destroys it.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i've got another copy. how do you think your wife would feel if she saw this not to mention your colleagues?}
<A>__{dulaney's temper is near the breaking point again, he strains to control himself.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{you can think whatever you want, frank but i didn't kill andrew, and i'm not going to prison for something i didn't do.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you're a monster.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{no i'm a survivor.}
