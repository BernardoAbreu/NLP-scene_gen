<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{the bouncer mentioned there was a game in progress. i hope i'm not intruding.}

<D>__{what was his name, the bouncer's?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i don't remember.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{a card player with amnesia. this should be fun.}
<A>__{at table moments later rusty deals the next hand.}
<C>__{topher}
<D>__{what do you do for a living, mr. ocean? if you don't mind my asking.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{why should i mind? two cards, please...}
<P>__{(long beat)}

<P>__{(finishing his deal)}
<D>__{one card to me.}
<P>__{(to danny, pointedly)}
<D>__{... but you can't.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{my fence seemed confident enough.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{if you're dealing with cash, you don't need a fence.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{some people just lack vision.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{probably everybody in cell block e.}
<A>__{now the other players realize. these guys have a relationship. in fact, a criminal one. and, judging from their steely glares across the table, not a happy one.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{well, that's all behind us now.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{i should hope so.}
<A>__{danny smiles, icily of course, it's not then pulls out his wallet.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i raise you five hundred dollars.}
<A>__{a hush in the room. danny has thrown down the gauntlet. he and rusty hold each other's stares.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{guys: day one: what's the first rule of poker?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{um, never bet on, uh, on a }
<C>__{topher}
<D>__{'leave emotion at the door.'}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{that's right. my friend here just raised me out of pique.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{today's lesson. how to draw out a bluff. this early in the game, that much money, i'm thinking he's holding nothing better than a pair of face cards.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{seth, raise him.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{okay. uh, your five hundred and... another two?}
<A>__{rusty nods, and seth pushes in his chips.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{tophe...}
<C>__{topher}
<D>__{seven to me. plus three. what the hell.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{indeed. but be careful you don't push him too high too fast. want to keep him on the leash. i call.}
<A>__{it's josh's turn. he hesitates...}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{what's that to me? a thousand?}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{all you have to do is call.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(off josh's further hesitation)}
<D>__{what? your girlfriend holding your purse?}
<A>__{that does it. josh is in. the bet's to danny. he checks his hand, and seth starts to whisper to topher.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{contrary to what mr. ryan may say, seth, i always check my cards before i make a bet. but be cafeful. i could tell from your face you're holding three of a kind or better.}
<P>__{(digging his wallet out)}
<D>__{five hundred to call. and two grand more.}
<A>__{danny stares rusty down. the others look a little pale.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{guys, you're free to do what you like. it's a lot of money. but i'm staying in. he's trying to buy his way out of his bluff.}
<A>__{nobody looks too eager to call, but nobody wants to leave a grand on the table, either. finally, seth ponies up, and the others not be outdone do, too.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{we call.}
<A>__{danny sets down his hand. four nines. it's a winner. the others, jaws dropped, throw in their cards. for the first time tonight, rusty blanches.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{shit. sorry, guys. i i was sure he was bluffing.}
<A>__{as rusty plummets in the estimation of all the guys around him, danny rakes in his pot.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{thanks for the game, fellas.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{hey, i hate to ask this, but could you sign something for me? it's for the guys in the jointerior they just love all your shows.}
