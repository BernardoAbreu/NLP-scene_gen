<A>__{annie and grace arrive in the suburban. they exit. as they head towards the ranch, they see in the distance: pilgrim standing along the fence of a round pen. tom stands in the pen, holding a rope, looking at pilgrim.}
<L>__{exterior the round pen day}
<A>__{tom stands in the pen with pilgrim. he looks to see annie and grace approaching but makes no acknowledgement. he turns his focus back to pilgrim. annie and grace appear. grace takes a position (that is to become her regular spot) a distance away from the pen. annie moves in closer, beside smokey (a ranch hand) with one leg up on the pen fence.}

<D>__{trying to get his eye.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{how's it going?}
<A>__{smokey doesn't respond how it's going is exactly how it looks. tom takes a few steps, stops and stands still again. we sense the process is long and requires great patience.}
