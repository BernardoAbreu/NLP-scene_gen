<C>__{tony}
<D>__{not at all.}
<C>__{amport}
<D>__{he feels you and he...are modern men...of similar mind...}

<C>__{tony }
<D>__{bizarre. why is charles doing this?}
<C>__{aide}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{creeping up to me like this. he did it at the airport when he asked me to `deal' with his mother. aide #2 ecause he knows that if the queen continues to get it wrong over diana, it won't be long before the royals become public enemy no 1.}
<P>__{( a beat)}
<D>__{terrified of being shot, apparently.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{who, charles?}
<C>__{aide}
<D>__{his people have already been onto us asking for extra protection. ide #2 he probably thinks if he's seen to be on our side, the queen will be the one left in the firing line, not him.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{what? so it's ok for his mother to take the bullet, not him?}
<P>__{shakes head)}
<D>__{what a family.}
