<L>__{interior stained class window day}
<A>__{jesus delivers the sermon on the mount in vibrant red, blue and green stained glass. an organ plays a hymn badly. notes are missed, skipped over and mutilated. pan down to a procession of nuns who march into a chapel at the ancient st. katherine's convent. the organ isn't getting any better, and we see it is being played by sister alma, a seventy year old nun with arthritis and a hearing aid. apparently the hearing aid is malfunctioning, because sister alma doesn't seem to realize how badly she's playing. as the last nun in the procession enters the chapel, she closes the door behind her. across the lobby, the front door opens and eddie enters with a very reluctant christy.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(to eddie)}
<D>__{i hate you. i totally hate you.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{safest place in the world. you think vince would look for you here?}
<A>__{as christy looks around the lobby, various religious artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified p0v. angle on a crucifix, casting an ominous shadow, a stack of hymnals, and a large, framed sunday school style portrait of st. katherine. christy shudders.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{nuns, eddie. there are nuns here. everywhere. it's crawling with 'em.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{it's a convent. all you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{with nuns? with rulers? no way. i'm gonna go back, work things out with vince.}
<A>__{christy turns to head back to the entrance, but eddie catches her arm.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{vince has put out a contract on you. a hundred grand. you've seen him in action.}
<A>__{christy searches his eyes for a lie, but realizes he's telling the truth.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{but... but vince loves me. how could he... i mean, five years...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{and one bullet. that's all it's gonna take.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(suddenly scared)}
<D>__{but vince has contacts all over the place! this is san francisco! they'll be looking for me!}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{everywhere but this little hole in the wall convent. nobody knows you're here but me. we're trying to get a quick court date. a month, maybe two, tops. i will spring you as soon as i can.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(panicking)}
<D>__{i can't stay here! i will crack up! eddie, what am i gonna do?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{pray.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<A>__{from inside the chapel, the choir begins to sing a hymn horribly. the voices don't blend, and individual notes are real migraine material. christy looks aghast. eddie urges her into a corridor, and she follows.}
