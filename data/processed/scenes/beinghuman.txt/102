<A>__{while francisco's attention has been on the natives, hector has sidled up to him, still hoping to ingratiate himself. he talks while they watch the two events, the hanging and the meeting.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i hate it when people have to die.}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{it's foolishness. killing our own men when we have the whole of africa to face.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{it's foolish squabbling at all. we should be friends.}
<A>__{francisco looks at him for the meaning in what he is saying. hector shrugs. he takes a small bundle from his jacket and gives it to francisco.}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{some bread and raisins.}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{i thought everything was shared out on the raft...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{well this wasn't. it's for her... and you.}
<A>__{francisco looks hector straight in the eye, looking for his angle. but this time there is none. hector is simply a lonely man seeking to retrieve lost friendship. there is a glimmer of sympathy in francisco's face. on the high dunes the slave and the natives have now parted company. the deserters still spin at the end of their ropes, the priest praying at their feet. francisco walks away from him. hector calls out.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i must speak to her!}
