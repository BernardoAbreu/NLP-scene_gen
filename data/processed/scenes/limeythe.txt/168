<L>__{exterior big sur house. back porch. night.}
<A>__{valentine stumbles out. notices avery slumped on the deck, mortally wounded. goes to him as if concerned but actually just to take the gun. then runs off the porch toward the steps that lead down to the sea.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{comes out after him, the knife still in his back. so intent on catching valentine he fails at first to notice avery lying in the shadows.}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{has just barely managed to reach stacy's pistol. raises it weakly. points it at wilson.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{seems to feel it. turns. locks eyes with avery. avery could already have shot him. but there's a momentary sense of recognition: both of them just foot soldiers for fat cats and avery's is not worth saving.}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{lowers the gun. nods in the direction valentine went.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{... that way ...}
<A>__{wilson moves on. avery just lies there, presumably to die.}
