<L>__{exterior the toppled rig resuming}
<A>__{fran's ford skids to a stop outside the van. ...just as the ranger brings charlie out of the rig. the kid is shaking, traumatized. he begins to cry... fran gets the idea. she hurries over.}
<L>__{exterior wheat field resuming}
<A>__{mackelway and zero wrestle, surrounded and obscured by all of that wheat... zero is a monster, and he's got that tire iron. mackelway has a busted wrist. hardly a fair fight. but mackelway is battling: kicking, clawing, getting in as many shots as he can. his shirt rips away from his body, exposing that brand mark. they roll back and forth. until:}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<P>__{(calmly, firmly)}
<D>__{up.}
<A>__{zero freezes. mackelway too. they turn to find: o'ryan... who stands here, mackelway's gun in hand.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{up.}
<A>__{mackelway's relief is total. he pushes zero away, rising. zero pulls himself off the ground, chagrinned.}
<C>__{zero}
<P>__{(re: mackelway)}
<D>__{glad you're here, man. guy was about to kill me.}
<A>__{o'ryan, without ceremony, puts a bullet through zero's left palm. that got mackelway's attention. zero howls with pain, his palm gushing. the tire iron falls to the ground. mackelway approaches o'ryan.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{i will take it from here.}
<A>__{he extends his good hand to o'ryan: "the gun." o'ryan pauses. then...}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{are you going to shoot him?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{give me the gun, o'ryan.}
<C>__{zero}
<D>__{hey, i just surrendered.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{zero}
<D>__{i surrendered! that's it!}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{shut up!!!}
<A>__{o'ryan wheels around, aiming the gun right at zero's face. that shuts the guy up in a hurry. from that service road now, we hear a line of sirens, approaching from a distance. unit after unit.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<P>__{(quietly now)}
<D>__{look at him, mack. he's not human anymore. go dig up that old lady's backyard you'll find bodies there... maybe hundreds of them. of course, ya gotta get a warrant first, chain of custody's gotta be followed. one breach, and he walks.}
<P>__{(no reply)}
<D>__{my way, he's eliminated; the world is rid of him. it's a lot closer to justice than having some prosecutor tell you you've left a tissue sample in the wrong lab. isn't it?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<P>__{(that stung)}
<D>__{give me the fucking gun!}
<A>__{o'ryan turns, studies him. ...and hands him the gun. just like that. mackelway eyes it. o'ryan doesn't say a word, just crosses back to zero, and grabs that tire iron off the ground. o'ryan's now standing right behind zero, as:}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<P>__{(at mackelway)}
<D>__{you have to understand: none of this was arbitrary. we were chosen, you and i.}
<A>__{whap! o'ryan just swung that tire iron into zero's rib cage. we hear bones crack, and air rushing from the guy's lungs. he drops to his knees, gasping.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{i saw us here. you did too.}
<A>__{thump! another violent swing of that tire iron, busting up the other side of zero's torso. now both sides of his rib cage have shattered. breathing is almost impossible. mackelway tightens. his head just began to throb...}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{okay. you made your pointerior}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{bullshit! if i'd made my fucking point you would've shot him yourself by now!}
<A>__{another swing of that tire iron, across the back of zero's neck. he crumbles, face down. fuck it. mackelway crosses to o'ryan and puts that gun right up against the back of o'ryan's head.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{enough!}
<A>__{then, an odd thing... o'ryan simply smiles. something about having that gun pointed right at him it's a relief.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{drop it.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{or what?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{just drop it.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{would you shoot me?}
<A>__{that's something mackelway doesn't want to consider.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{put it down.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{i want you to think for a second. about your destiny. who you are. you're cursed, like i am except you keep running from it.}
<P>__{(mackelway's silent)}
<D>__{you hear things. you see things. that's why you can't sleep, why your head always aches.}
<A>__{he turns. they are face to face. nothing but that gun between them.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{...and it's why you are going to let me kill this animal. and then you're going to kill me.}
<A>__{that threw mackelway badly. o'ryan seizes the moment wheeling around... he takes one last swing at zero, like a lumberjack. the tire iron impacts zero's skull with a dull thud, cracking it. he is dead. mackelway's eyes go wide. whole thing has been a blur. o'ryan releases the tire iron... and drops to his knees like a man awaiting execution, his back to mackelway. mackelway is silent. stunned. the blood from zero's caved in skull finds its way to o'ryan's knees. but o'ryan remains peaceful. calm. ready.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{get up.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{i can't do that, mack. i've seen all this already. for months now.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{get up.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{every time, we're in this field: same wind, same rain. and you...}
<A>__{he puts a finger to his head, pretending it's a gun. then he pretends to pull the trigger. mackelway gets the idea.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{it's okay. i want you to. i'm begging you to.}
<A>__{mackelway doesn't know what to do. then, making matters worse:}
<C>__{fran }
<P>__{(aloud)}
<D>__{mack?}
<A>__{she's about a hundred yards away... but she'll be here soon enough. that puts some heat under o'ryan:}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{i'm tired, mack.}
<C>__{fran }
<D>__{can you hear me?}
<A>__{she's 90 yards out now...}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{pull the trigger...}
<P>__{(no reply)}
<D>__{i'm not going to jail. now pull the fucking trigger!}
<A>__{mackelway's frozen. o'ryan knows it.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{fucking coward.}
<A>__{o'ryan rises now, facing mackelway.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{some things are not up to us to decide. they just exist. they're inevitable. this field. this rain. this moment. it has all already happened. you know that. you've seen it too.}
<A>__{he shoves mackelway in the chest.}
<C>__{fran }
<D>__{mack?}
<A>__{she's 70 yards out now...}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{shut it off for me.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{i'm not going to kill you, o'ryan.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{of course you will. i've seen it.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{you saw wrong!}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{that's impossible.}
<C>__{fran }
<D>__{mack? can you hear me?}
