<L>__{interior chapel parlor}
<A>__{rob stays back, watching mourners approach laura and her mother, hugging them. after awhile, laura sees rob through the throng, hanging back. she breaks through and to him, holding him close for a long time...}
<C>__{rob }
<D>__{...and when she let's go of me, i feel i don't need to become a different person. it's happened already.}
<L>__{interior laura's parents' house afternoon}
<A>__{a cozy old victorian house, full of things furniture, paintings, ornaments, plants which don't go together but which have obviously been chosen with care and taste. rob and liz stand, drinking wine. jo approaches them.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(to jo)}
<D>__{how are you?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i'm all right, i suppose. and mom's not too bad. but laura... i dunno.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{she's had a pretty rough few weeks already, without this. it's hard when you're putting all of your efforts into one part of your life and it doesn't work out.}
<A>__{she glances at rob, embarrassed.}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(sincere)}
<D>__{don't mind me. no problem. just pretend you're talking about somebody else.}
<A>__{jo smiles, liz gives him a look.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{we are talking about somebody else. laura. laura and ray, actually.}
<A>__{rob begins to turn red. anger, sorrow, everything else building.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{enough, liz.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{enough of what?}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(getting louder)}
<D>__{i know i can't speak now because laura's father died, and i just have to take it because otherwise i'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self centered. well, i'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, i'm really sorry jo.}
<P>__{(lowering his voice)}
<D>__{but you know, liz... i can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself. and maybe you think i should, but it's not much of a life, you know?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{maybe i've been a little unfair. but is this really the time?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{only because it's never the time. i can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{if by "we" you are referring to men, then i have to say that just the once would do.}
<A>__{rob looks around the room, beginning to hyperventilate and near tears. he sees laura in a corner of the room surrounded by four or five mourners. he crosses to them and breaks through to her.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{he breaks away from her and slips out the front door.}
