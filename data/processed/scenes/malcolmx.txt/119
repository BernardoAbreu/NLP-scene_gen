<D>__{i must emphasize at the outstart, that the honorable elijah muhammad is not a politician, so i'm not here this afternoon as a republican, nor a democrat, not as a mason nor an elk, not as a christian nor a jew, not as a catholic nor a protestant, not as a baptist nor a methodist, not even as an american. for if i was an american the problem that confronts our people today would not exist. so i stand here as what i was when i was born: a black man!}
