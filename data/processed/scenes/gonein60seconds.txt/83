<C>__{beach boys}
<D>__{"well, i'm not braggin,' babe so don't put me down but i got the fastest set of wheels in town, etc."}
<A>__{yes, it's the requisite rock to an oldie bit ... but god, it's fun. as they exorcise some pre boost jitters. only kip stands aside from the frolic ... we watch them dance and laugh and sing for a bit ... and then atley jackson is there. and behind him, another calitri goon... and, finally, calitri himself stands there. someone kills the music. they all look at him... donny and the sphinx nod to atley ...}
<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{this is how you're spending my time? having a sock hop?}

<C>__{calitri}
<D>__{with all the free time i've had not counting cars as they're loaded onto my ship, i've managed to sand the cedar inside your box, kip. this will protect you from the anaerobic bacteria, that normally thrives in an airless; environment. thus prolonging decay ...}
<A>__{he smiles ... and kip actually makes a run for him... only to be held back by tumbler and donny ...}
<C>__{memphis}
