<D>__{you said reese was older.}
<C>__{mrs. asher}
<D>__{by three minutes. they were very different boys.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{to lose one son so young, then to lose the other two years later; to think you've lost him. that must have been devastating.}
<A>__{mrs. asher lights a cigarette. crosses to the window, so poised, so tragic. grace studies her with a critical eye.}
<C>__{mrs. asher}
<D>__{reese was very charismatic and outgoing. martin was introverted. he never thrived like reese. he was a very disturbed young man. reese was martin's world. martin never recovered his equilibrium after we lost him. he changed. martin began to intimidate me. he could be very menacing. he began imitating reese at school and that lead to fights with other students. at sixteen he stole some jewelry that was very precious to me and ran away. a few days later the thunder bay police called and said my son had been killed changing a tire.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{the police want you to sign this so they can exhume the body in martin's grave and verify identity.}
<A>__{mrs. asher takes the paper.}
<C>__{mrs. asher}
<D>__{i will sign it. i already know somebody else's son is in that casket.}
<A>__{the phone rings.}
<C>__{mrs. asher}
<D>__{excuse me.}
