<D>__{father, did you know what that meant? with that yawn i saw my defeat turn into a victory. and mozart was lucky the emperor only yawned once. three yawns and the opera would fail the same night; two yawns, within a week at most. with one yawn the composer could still get }

<A>__{mozart is pacing up and down. salieri is listening sympathetically.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{nine performances! nine! that's all it's had and withdrawn.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i know; it's outrageous. still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{but what is it they don't like?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{well, i can speak for the emperor. you made too many demands on the royal ear. the poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{what did you think of it yourself? did you like it at all?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i think it's marvelous. truly.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{it's the best opera yet written. i know it! why didn't they come?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i think you overestimate our dear viennese, my friend. do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{i know, i know. perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.}
<C>__{salieri}
<P>__{(fuming)}
<D>__{i wouldn't presume. all the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, i would like you to see my new piece. it would be a tremendous honour for me.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{oh no, the honour would be all mine.}
<C>__{salieri}
<P>__{(bowing)}
<D>__{grazie, mio caro, wolfgang!}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{grazie, a lei, signor antonio!}
<A>__{he bows too, giggling.}
