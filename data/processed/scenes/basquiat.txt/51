<A>__{kneeling on the floor, jean covers the surface of the refrigerator door with fast, rushing strokes. he mixes paint in a large soupbowl and dips his hair in the bowl. pressing his head to the door, he paints with his hair. he stops to examine the marks. he hits his head against the door harder and harder.}

<L>__{interior gina's apartment morning}
<A>__{camera pulls back: revealing jean's eyes. they're open and motionless. his head is tilted toward his chest. off screen we hear the sounds of gina coming home: the lock turns. the door opens. gina comes in and drops a bag on the floor.}

<A>__{silence. she picks up the mail from under the door and walks into the room. there's a lump on the floor. it's jean.}
<C>__{gina }
<D>__{wake up! i'm back!}
<A>__{she shakes his arm. no result. she lifts his head, revealing his painted hair. she shakes him harder. his body is totally limp. the whites of his eyes are red; his pupils slowly float up, vanishing.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{jean, what did you do to yourself?}
<A>__{she listens to his breath, then to his heart.}
<C>__{gina}

<D>__{basquiat, what did you take?}
<A>__{jean tries to pick himself up from the floor. he gets up stiffly, like pinnocchio. the long sleep made his limbs wooden.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{nothing special just some weed.}
<A>__{he finds an old joint and lights it up.}
