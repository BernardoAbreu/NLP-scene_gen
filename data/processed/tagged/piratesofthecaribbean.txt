<D>__{you know what you're doing, i will give you that ... excellent form ... but how's your footwork? if i step here }

<A>__{he explodes: kicks a rack, causing a sword to fall into his hand; uses his foot to bring his dropped sword into the air, catches it and attacks jack, both blades flashing. jack parries with sword and chain. jack's chain wraps around will's sword; will twists the handle of his guard through a link, and stabs the sword up into the ceiling so jack's manacled left arm is now suspended from the ceiling. not good. he parries using one hand, twisting and dodging around the furnace jack compresses the bellows, blowing a shower of sparks into will's face. jack grabs the chain, hoists himself up, kicks with his feet, knocking will back. jack uses his full weight, yanks the sword from the ceiling. hurls a wooden mallet at will, then a second, hitting will on the wrist. will drops his sword, falls down, gets up jack's pistol is aimed directly between will's eyes. will steps back, directly in front of the back exit. glares, rubs his wrist gingerly.}

<D>__{aye. see, after you're done with the royal navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the h.m.s. dauntless. there you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do? of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue? the dauntless a first rate ship of line, and with it, you can rule the seas.}
