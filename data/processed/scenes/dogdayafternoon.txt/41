<A>__{as cops move forward and try to catch the bills. some blow into the crowd. fights break out in the crowd as they scramble for the money. the crowd breaks the barriers and swarms after the cash. cops try to retrieve bills; fist fights, arrests.}
<B>__{moretti}
<A>__{staring at the mess. sonny also watching the people. there is in both of them the same reaction of faint disgust at the greed unleashed. sonny angrily hurls another bundle after the first... then laughs as he watches the people fighting. moretti nods ironically at him. sonny turns and enters the bank with the food. the fighting goes on in the street.}
