<D>__{... at nine forty eastern time, the agreement was reached, and except for this upcoming second half, the strike is history.}
<A>__{on al, dan and boomer boomer's tie is off and his shirt is torn. dan looks guilty, but still angry.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{it's about time. i say let the professionals back on the field. the fans deserve nothing less.}
<C>__{boomer}
<D>__{yeah, you would say that.}
<B>__{on ball}
<A>__{the dallas kicker puts the ball in the end zone for a touchback.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{he starts to follow the offense out on the field. then he turns and sees annabelle engrossed in a cheer. he runs over to her.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{are you okay? is it your side?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i'm okay. i owe you an apology.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{what? you do?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{yes. i will explain later. but thank you for believing in me. you give me strength just looking at you.}
<A>__{and with that, shane takes her in his arms and kisses her deeply. the crowd on that side of the field reacts to the kiss with a "wooooooo!"}
<C>__{al }
<D>__{well, this is a first. shane falco seems to be...}
<C>__{boomer }
<D>__{hell, al, he's necking with a cheerleader! i've done a little of that in my time.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{the players are not supposed to fraternize with the cheerleaders.}
<C>__{boomer }
<D>__{hey, dan, what are they gonna do? fire him?!}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{he breaks the kiss and looks up in the stands at eddie martel. shane gives him the finger. the crowd goes "wooooo!" at that too. martel doesn't think this is funny. shane walks onto the field leaving a confused but happy annabelle. he walks past dallas defensive lineman butler.}
<C>__{butler}
<D>__{that wasn't too smart.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{suck my dick.}
<A>__{butler is too shocked for a comeback.}
<B>__{on huddle}
<A>__{it breaks and shane walks to the line of scrimmage.}
<C>__{al }
<D>__{here we go, first and ten for the redskins. twenty four zip dallas.}
<A>__{we can see now that wilkinson and bateman are now part of the offense. they line up as receivers opposite defensive halfbacks. in fact, everyone but shane is on the line of scrimmage, paired up across from a cowboy. shane leans over reese and takes in the dallas defense. the dallas middle linebacker yells at shane.}
<C>__{linebacker}
<D>__{are you ready for more pain, footsteps?}
<A>__{shane just smiles.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{blue thirteen! blue thirteen! hut! hut! hut!}
<B>__{montage}
<A>__{on the snap, many things happen at once: a) cochran}
<D>__{sticks his fingers inside butler's face mask and pokes both eyes. butler screams!}
<A>__{b) shane}
<D>__{throws the ball as hard as he can at the middle linebacker and hits him in the crotch. the guy grabs himself and collapses.}

<A>__{f) lee}
<D>__{pulls the defensive lineman in front of him to the ground. then he falls on him. the guy screams.}
<B>__{on field}
<A>__{all across the line of scrimmage, redskins are punching, kicking and gouging the dallas defense. whistles blow. flags fly everywhere. most of the dallas players are down and screaming. jamal stands across from a defensive lineman. he hasn't touched the guy. but he nods to the player to look at his hand. the guy looks down just as jamal flicks open a deadly looking switchblade. the guy jumps back and yells:}
<C>__{defender}
<D>__{he's got a knife!}
<A>__{but there is so much confusion that nobody pays any attention. jamal slips the knife away.}
<C>__{al }
<D>__{whoa! flags fly everywhere! i've never seen anything like this!}
<C>__{boomer }
<D>__{unbelievable! one washington player had a cowboy in what appeared to be a police choke hold.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{i see at least five flags... no six!}
<A>__{the officials are going crazy trying to figure out the penalties as shane and the offense back up and make room for the dallas medical staff who come running out on the field. some dallas players are livid:}
<C>__{butler}
<P>__{(to the ref)}
<D>__{he scratched my eyes out!}
<C>__{linebacker}
<D>__{he hit me on purpose!}
<A>__{on mcginty he's smiling to himself on the sidelines.}
<B>__{on referee}
<A>__{he faces the cameras, turns on his microphone and sums up the penalties.}
<C>__{ref}
<D>__{unsportsmanlike conduct, number 72, number 81 and number 87 on the offense, fifteen yards...}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{... times three... that's forty five yards. illegal use of hands, number 48 on the offense, fifteen yards. that makes it sixty yards. unnecessary roughness number 65 and number 32, fifteen yards... that's, wait... forty five... no, thirty...}
<P>__{(turns to}
<D>__{another}
<P>__{ref)}
<D>__{... how many yards so far?}
<B>__{on ball}
<A>__{a ref is taking a very long walk with it. he stops at the redskin two yard line and puts it down.}
<B>__{in huddle}
<A>__{shane leans in.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{okay, everybody, stick together and don't take any shit. let's make 'em hurt!}
