<L>__{interior ravenscar abandoned wing}
<A>__{front glass doors swing open and john and midnite calmly strut inside. stop. hear the o.s. murmurs of an unseen crowd. this emergency room is crammed with people. lawyers. brokers. soccer moms. truck drivers. etc... most are crowded in front of a set of double doors. room goes dead silent as all eyes lock on our guys. john steps from midnite, raises his hands like a riot cop.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{okay let's cut the scratch and call it a night. meeting's over.}
<A>__{that's got their attention. as entertainment. a few chuckle. john is surprised to see ellie stepping from the crowd. still that bundle of sexual energy.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{ellie?}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{oh, john, you know how much i love it on this side. this was just an opportunity to make it permanent.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you think his son will be any different? he'll just turn this place into his own hell and then where will you to party, heaven?}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{no need to get nasty.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{never bothered you before.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i am so going to miss our little trysts.}
<A>__{ellie steps closer. the crowd starts to close in with her.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm sure you will.}
<A>__{john pulls out his lighter, holds it up flicks it on.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{now turn around and take your friends with you.}
<A>__{can he look more ridiculous?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i will deport you. all of you. you know i can.}
<A>__{john steps back up onto a chair, thrusts the lighter higher }
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{oh, john, this is embarrassing. where is your pride?}
<A>__{ right under a sprinkler head.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{go to hell.}
<A>__{ellie looks up just as the sprinklers trigger.}
<B>__{series of shots}
<A>__{ellie and a room of half humans all looking up as water sprays from every nozzle. john and midnite tense because the first drops have no effect. a beat a spurt in the waterlines and suddenly shrieks fill the room as half human skin begins to fry.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{holy water!}
<A>__{emergency lighting has snapped on throwing the room into a strobing nightmare of action. flashes of human skin melting, revealing snippets of the true demons underneath. it's total pandemonium as their rage is directed toward the only real humans in the room. john and midnite fling their coats open draw their weapons and starts firing away at the attacking horde. sacred bullets cause major damage wounds that ripple out through demon bodies. john and midnite slam back to back spinning under the protective shield of a showering sprinkler head shooting at all manner of distorted forms that venture into the column of spray. one reloads while the other fires. it's a hellish form of a turkey shoot. nothing sacred, nothing spared. john goes for the double doors. midnite covers him blows away another two disintegrating demons. two come up behind and he spins, takes them down. john gets to the doors, starts to open them when ellie jumps onto his back nails digging in.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i'm not going back there!}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we are what we are, ellie }
<A>__{john fires over his back, loosens her grip. he grabs hold, shoves her face up into the spray of an overhead sprinkler head. legs flail about. midnite comes out of the rain grabs john.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{john drops ellie to the floor. no more pretty face no face at all yet the screams still come. john and midnite get to the doors shove through.}
