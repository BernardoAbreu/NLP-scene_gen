<L>__{exterior highway attack aftermath next moment}
<A>__{leavitt's throwing punches as he's dragged with velocity to the trail suburban, idling. pistol whipped viciously, repeatedly until they're able to kick him inside. another officer from the trailing vehicle steps up with an ak 47, pulls back the cocking mechanism, ready to spray the dazed occupants of our suburban the officer's ankles and shins detonate. pop pop pop pop from the driver's seat: haytham. screams from the would be shooter at double volume. haytham keeps firing as the officer, hit multiple times, falls hard. the trailing suburban hesitates, slams into our suburban just as fleury is getting out of the wreckage. everybody else still inside, knocked silly. the trailing suburban backs up quick. fleury instinctively goes for his holster: empty for days now.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{gun!}
<A>__{trailing suburban accelerates away now, as janet struggles out. haytham's 9 mm in hand racked open: empty. fleury steps away from the now black smoke pouring from the vehicle in the passenger seat of the trail suburban, he sees the officer that checked passports at prince sultan air base.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{ door help }
<A>__{fleury rips grant's door open. trapped smoke billows, clears: grant's arm closest to the outside of the vehicle dangles at an unnatural angle, bleeding badly.}
<C>__{grant sykes }
<D>__{can't release }
<A>__{fleury begins sawing grant's seat belt with a jagged piece of metal.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{hands up you're gonna fall }
<A>__{sykes still does, ugly. fleury and janet rip him free of the suburban. haytham's pulling shotguns, handguns, ammo from the flipped vehicle. haytham pointing ahead, to the fading roster tail. in arabic:}
<C>__{sergeant haytham}
<D>__{they're going to disappear...}
<A>__{desperate, fleury looks in the direction of the fleeing suburban: the rooster tail it leaves getting smaller. al ghazi nods, swings his head to thesnarled wrecked highway traffic. people hesitantly step toward uniforms they trust on instinct. haytham dumps the pile of weapons at the team's feet, re loads his 9mm. janet ties a half assed tourniquet around sykes' reminder of an arm. al ghazi steps toward the approaching crowd: they see his state, his gun, and turn back: panic starts to infect the larger mass, then the topper automatic gunfire from somewhere. glass dirt metal bursts around us: this attack is still going. fleury looks up: just the roof of an old mercedes on the median, dirt kicked up behind them, running behind lines of stopped wrecked traffic now. the barrel of a rifle held high out the window like a taunt. accelerating for another opening to finish the job. scared motorists devolve into terrified motorists. many have abandoned their vehicles to sprint into the desert, the rest go smash 'em up derby folly: 50 panicked drivers aiming for the same spots. fleury snatches an m4a1 from the stack dropped by haytham, up to his shoulder, hustling toward the next break in traffic. the mercedes is approaching at 80 mph.}

<P>__{(back to his crew)}
<D>__{get down!}
<A>__{al ghazi starts screaming in arabic, motioning frantically to the citizens who have turned back, running toward them, in arabic:}
<D>__{colonel al ghazi down!}
<A>__{fleury's view blocked by fleeing saudis: just intermittent flashes of the mercedes braking hard, massive dust cloud behind them, sliding toward the opening fleury pre sighted. intermittent wild shots fired from the suv, vaguely in our direction. fleury flips a switch on the left side of the rifle, just forward of the handle: full auto. takes a deep, measured sniper's breath, eases the stock snug aimpoint up to his right eye, and without hesitation lets loose the entire clip perfectly: one heartbeat before the mercedes hits the gap. the right side of the mercedes shreds just as it appears. fleury's clip gone in a flash, yet more rounds still hit the mercedes: al ghazi four feet away, firing his own salvo from a knee. something bright red pops against the driver's side window now, the mercedes rip slides to a stop. commotion inside. wild, half aimed shots back at us. then it starts up again. al ghazi bolts toward the line of stopped traffic. searching for something big, empty, still running. fleury right on his heels.}
<P>__{colonel al ghazi (cont'd)}
<D>__{we move now or we lose him.}
<A>__{early 90's land rover. desert tough. driver long gone, exhaust plumes pumping out. al ghazi dives into the driver's seat, fleury shotgun. guns it to the rest of the survivors, an eye on the rooster tail of the mercedes he and fleury just shredded, heading the same direction as leavitt's kidnappers. al ghazi jumps out, ushers haytham into the driver's seat. in arabic:}
<P>__{colonel al ghazi (cont'd)}
<D>__{you know suweidi you know how to go fast.}
<A>__{fleury helps sykes into the rear. janet loads the weapons. jump in. the land rover spits it's own tell tale plume as it sprints away down the median, dodging traffic, in desperate pursuit. startling silence comes sudden now as the fight moves elsewhere. receding engines. petering screams shouts. hold on the flipped, still burning still smoking suburbans. surreal in the sun smoke haze.}
