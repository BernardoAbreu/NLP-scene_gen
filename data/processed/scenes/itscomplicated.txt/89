<L>__{exterior road to jane's house late day}
<A>__{jane drives home, when she notices jake's porsche in her driveway. she gets out of her car, finds jake sitting on the bench swing hanging from a large oak in the front yard. jane crosses to jake. he moves over. jane sees the humor in this gesture and sits on the swing with him, letting out a sigh. side by side, they swing in the late afternoon breeze.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{jane doesn't answer right away.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{how far back does that sorry go?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{how far back do you need it to go?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{way back.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{consider it an all inclusive apology. from not being the husband you needed to showing up nude on your bed last night.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yeah, what were you thinking with that move?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{that you'd find me irresistible.}
<A>__{jane turns to him, her eyes warming up to him.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{never considered the alternative.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{gotta love that about you.}
<A>__{they swing some more.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{oh, man, can't believe i got up to bat again and blew it.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you didn't blow it. we blew it. we blew it the first time around. this time... we just should've known better. too much has happened. too much time has passed.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{and you don't think we could make it right?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{does that mean you didn't feel it was totally right either?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{being with you jane is the best i'm gonna be.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{but do you agree that it wasn't really...?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{it was complicated.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{begging for an answer.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i thought it was good. i wanted it to be good.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{guess that's as close as i'm gonna get.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{do you always have to be so hard on me?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{no. i don't.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i don't regret giving it another shot.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{probably would've been better if you hadn't been married.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{it may never have happened if i wasn't married.}
<A>__{jane looks at jake, knowing how true that is. they sit, side by side, as they sway in the breeze.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i don't regret it either.}
<A>__{they continue rocking, not much more to say. as camera pulls away, we:}
