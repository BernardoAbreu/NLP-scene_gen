<L>__{interior circus archive day}
<A>__{the lift cage we saw earlier is being raised from the floor by a janitor at the winch. another janitor is removing files from it. radiating out from the lift cage are the shelves of files that make up the reading room. we find guillam moving along the shelves reading the fluorescent number cards. he takes a file out, leaving his green slip in the brackets provided by each file. guillam looks across at his real objective... a row of anonymous looking files on the next aisle the archived duty officer's log books, spines bearing the year and month they cover. and in his way a girl perched on a ladder, a man mending a radiator. the man turns round and stares straight at guillam. suddenly he points straight at him. for a moment guillam freezes, unnerved. then he glances over his shoulder and realises the man is communicating with another workman behind him. abruptly, guillam walks over to the file and swaps it, keeping the title close to his chest. he goes back to his desk, a light film of sweat on his forehead. he sits, a pencil clamped between his teeth, waiting... from somewhere nearby comes the sound of a phone ringing, then being answered. moments later...}
