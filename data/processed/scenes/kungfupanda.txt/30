<C>__{commander}
<D>__{what?!?!}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"double the guard?! extra precautions?! your prison may not be adequate!"}
<A>__{the goose is quaking in fear. stern rhinos surround him, staring daggers at him. the commander snaps the scroll shut.}
<C>__{commander }
<D>__{you doubt my prison's security?}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{absolutely not.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{shifu does. i'm just the messenger.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{i will give you a message for your master shifu.}
<B>__{on a bridge}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{escape from chogun prison is impossible!}
<A>__{the goose is awed by the cavernous prison.}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{whoa.}
<A>__{the goose looks over the bridge's edge. the prison goes down a long ways. the commander hits the goose on the back.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{impressive, isn't it?}
<A>__{a feather from the goose drifts down the prison.}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{yes, very impressive. it's very impressive.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{one way in, one way out, one thousand guards, and one prisoner.}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{yes, except that prisoner is tai lung...}
<B>__{at the elevator}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{take us down.}
<A>__{several guard rhinos winch the goose and the commander down. the commander grabs the chain and shakes the elevator, trying to scare the goose.}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<A>__{the commander just laughs. the elevator finally lands, sending an echo throughout the prison. at doors a number of doors unlock, one after the other. finally, a drawbridge is lowered out onto an island.}
<C>__{zeng }
<D>__{oh my...}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{behold, tai lung.}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{i will um...i'm just gonna wait right here.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{it's nothing to worry about. it's perfectly safe.}
<A>__{he shoves the goose out ahead of him.}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{oof!}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{crossbows! at the ready!}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{crossbows?!}
<A>__{they approach tai lung, a giant, muscular snow leopard bound in a giant piece of tortoise shell armor and chains. he barely registers signs of life. the commander walks right up to him.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{hey, tough guy, did you hear? oogway's finally gonna give someone the dragon scroll and it's not gonna be you!}
<A>__{the goose can't believe it.}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{what are you doing?! don't get him mad.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{what's he gonna do about it? i've got him completely immobilized.}
<A>__{the commander stomps on tai lung's tail. we hear a crunch. the goose flinches. but tai lung does not react.}
<C>__{commander }
<D>__{awww. did i step on the witty kitty's tail? awww.}
<A>__{tai lung doesn't move. his eyes stare coldly straight ahead.}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{i'm good. i've seen enough. i'm gonna tell shifu he's got nothing to worry about.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{no, he doesn't.}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{okay, i will tell him that. can we please go now?}
<A>__{the commander starts to walk back to the elevator. the goose hurries after him. the goose's feather flutters into frame. we follow the feather as it lands right in front of tai lung. his eyes open. tai lung grabs the feather with his tail.}
