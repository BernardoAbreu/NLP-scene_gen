<A>__{in the privacy of their tent dom paulo and his son are engaged in their nightly ritual, practicing on their recorders. dom paulo leads the young boy through an intricate, pretty tune. they sit formally and there is an air of stoicism about them, determined as they are to maintain their civilized habits in these bleakest of circumstances. but there is also a feeling of madness about it. the madness of a man who has lost a grip of what is going on about him. down on the beach men are waiting to die in the morning on his orders. the blend of formality and madness make the scene comic.}
