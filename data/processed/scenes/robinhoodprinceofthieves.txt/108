<L>__{exterior city square day}
<A>__{the scaffold is impregnable. celts and their chieftain guard the platform itself. the sherriff's men surround the base. the executioner encircles wulf's neck with the noose. sparks! tuck ignites a fuse cord leading to one of the barrels. a hand tightens the noose... another grasps an arrow. the executioner's eyes glint through the slits. nottingham intently watches wulf. the chieftain stands, impassive. fingers close on a bowstring... the fuse cord burns. wulf steps to the trap, ready to plunge. his eyes close. an arrow flies... slices through the executioner's eye slit. the executioner falls. little john celebrates... but the chieftain leaps forward... releases the trap. wulf's body plunges. the rope snaps tight. little john yells. fanny screams. a figure leaps onto the platform... the wounded soldier throws aside his crutch... robin! wulf dangles, strangling. his hands wrench at the choking cord. the burning fuse cord reaches the barrel. tuck hurls the smoking barrel thundering towards the sheriff... spotting it, nottingham urges his horse over his own men in his effort to escape. the chieftain smites at robin... his blow is blocked... by the celt with the boar's head. kaaboom! the gunpowder in the barrel explodes. spewing smoke and wood. screams of panic. soldiers fly. mass confusion. amidst the smoke... robin's sword slashes through wulf's rope. he hauls him onto the platform. another figure on the platform... the old woman. slashes the ropes of the other prisoners. whips off her wig... it's hal. he passes out weapons from a bundle under his arm.}

<C>__{hal}
<D>__{take that, ya mug.}
<A>__{no stutter this time! the woodsmen join battle with the guards. the chieftain cudgels his celt attacker across the head. the boar's head helmet tumbles... revealing aslan.}
<C>__{chieftain}
<D>__{impostor! you dishonor the clan.}
<A>__{aslan retreats, fending off the chieftain's shattering blows.}
<B>__{from parapet}
<A>__{john and fanny peer down as the smoke clears. they watch wulf struggle to his feet. a celt sneaks up behind him.}
<C>__{little john}

<A>__{he aims. grits his teeth... picks off the celt with a shaft.}
<C>__{little john}
<D>__{...or don't fight at all.}
<B>__{on scene}
<A>__{robin leaps and swings from gallows to gallows, kicking out, slashing down. sends two celts hurtling down the trap hole. will battles the sheriff. a reprise of his own fight with robin, the roles reversed. the sheriff, armed and mounted, flails at will, who, unarmed, dodges in and around the horse's legs. aslan and the chieftain are locked in mortal combat. aslan stumbles back and falls. the chieftain swipes at his head. aslan rolls aside. the sword smashes wood. tuck surrounded, rolls another smoking barrel... it}

<A>__{the greybeard baron spots little john and fanny on the parapet.}

<B>__{on scaffold}
<A>__{wulf guards the steps, beating back all comers.}
<B>__{on scene}
<A>__{aslan evades the charging chieftain. drop kicks a soldier, takes his sword, and whirls back at the chieftain. his blows have no effect on the scot's black armor. the sheriff rears his horse... hooves flail.. knocking will to his knees. the sheriff lunges... desperate, will grasps the sword, ignoring the pain... a tug of war. blood pours from will's hands, where the blade cuts in. he suddenly lets go... nottingham topples from his horse. will leaps on him.}
<C>__{will scarlet}
<D>__{pain or death, you butcher?}
<A>__{the sheriff's men drag will off before he can choke him. raging, nottingham climbs to his feet. will is held by four men.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{here's another message to robin hood, written in your blood.}
<A>__{he drives his sword repeatedly, insanely, into will's belly.}
<C>__{will scarlet}
<D>__{it's over, fool. you can kill my body, but you cannot kill our spirit.}
<A>__{he finally drops... nottingham heads for the castle. robin attempts to follow. he swings from the noose, using the rope to vault over the surrounding soldiers. as he lands, he is waylaid by one of the barons and his men.}
<C>__{redhead baron}
<D>__{it's hood! get him!}
<A>__{the chieftain knocks aslan down. aslan loses his sword.}
<C>__{chieftain}
<D>__{i am iron. i am rock. i am your death.}
<A>__{aslan spots one of john's arrows protruding from a dead celt's back. scrambles over and tears it out.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{you talk too much!}
<A>__{he leaps... rams the arrow through the chieftain's mouthpiece... out the back of his neck. the chieftain grabs his helmet, trying to rip it off. he topples, his life's blood gushing from both sides of his neck. aslan plants a foot on the slain warrior.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{englishmen! i am not one of you, yet i fight for you. against a tyrant. join me now. join robin hood.}
<A>__{the onlookers are inspired. grabbing weapons from fallen soldiers, many join the fray. nottingham runs through the castle gate. angry peasants pursue.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{lower the portcullis! now!}
<A>__{a guard winds down the giant gate. nottingham hurls him aside.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{too slow, fool!}
<A>__{he hacks at the ropes. the gate slices down like a guillotine, pinning soldiers and peasants alike. fighting his way towards the gate, robin sees with dismay that the portcullis is closed. weakening, he staves off the redhead baron's vicious assault. suddenly peasants are swarming over his attacker. the baron is dragged off and trampled down.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{friends! we must raise the gate.}
