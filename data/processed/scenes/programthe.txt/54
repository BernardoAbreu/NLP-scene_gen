<L>__{interior american history classroom day}
<A>__{a group of football players sits in the back of the class. as the history professor lectures at the board, darnell furiously takes notes. scott sherman, seizing the opportunity, leans forward from the desk behind him and pokes the football out of darnell's left hand. darnell, scott and two other freshman football players spring out of their seats, scrambling after the loose ball. the prof and the other students watch appalled as darnell and the others dive under chairs and overturn desks in pursuit of the elusive ball. finally, darnell, winded and disheveled, comes up with it. he and the others quickly return to their seats. the prof looks at darnell aghast.}
