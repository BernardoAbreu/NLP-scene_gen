<A>__{pryce, with a flashlight in hand, lowers himself down a rope to the bottom of the shaft where carrie waits. delfy follows. both take in the discovery. carrie moves over to the hatch. pulls on it. opens easily. she and pryce hit the interior with their lights. find themselves staring into...an airplane!}
<L>__{interior cargo bay continuous}
<A>__{off their lights every surface scintillates with ice crystals from the frozen atmosphere, undisturbed except for recent tracks of footprints filing in and out they go forward and aft, disappearing into darkness. place is tomb silent. twisted, and strewn with large containers scattered at odd angles victims of an intense impact. the plane is pitched up at the nose, making their footing precarious.}

<D>__{it's an antanov 74. russian made late fifties. no one's put these in the air for forty years.}
<A>__{carrie shuffles her way forward into the darkness, heading for the cockpit. something brushes her leg. she spins. shines her light which illuminates a hand, fingers in a clawed position as if in excruciating pain. she whips her light past the hand, up the arm captures the face of a man staring at her! it takes a moment to realize he's dead, pinned between two large metal crates. delfy stands still. staring. carrie throws a look back over her shoulder }
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{guess that makes three.}
<A>__{she continues on with delfy staying close. her light targets the cockpit door. it's closed.}
