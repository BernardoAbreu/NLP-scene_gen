<A>__{they stagger and fall, shattered and bleeding, save one who's merely lost his weapon. kurtz looks at him, his gun empty. he drops it and flips open the flap of his holster. the viet soldier goes for his pistol. kurtz beats him to the draw and bloes him into the night. he moves over to pick up the nva light machine gun. holding it at his hip, he stands atop one of the ruined walls and fires into the masses. his native men see him and rush for the chance to die beside him. they are quickly encircled by onrushing viets and are being overrun. the machine gun jams and kurtz grabs a rifle. when it's empty and the bayonet is off he wields it as a club.}
