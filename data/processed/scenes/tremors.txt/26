<A>__{earl pulls over. they climb out and peer up at the tower. edgar is hard to see through the criss crossing girders.}

<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{man, oh, man. he must've really been drunk this time.}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{edgar! what the hell you doing? get on down from there!}
<A>__{edgar doesn't move. val and earl shift about uncomfortably.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{well, shit, we can't leave him up there.}
<A>__{they stare at each other. someone's got to climb up. val raises his fist in the challenge. their fingers fly. rock breaks scissors. val loses. valentine unhappily climbs the tall tower while earl watches from below.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{hey, edgar, don't you move. i'm coming to get you...you damn fool, you owe me on this one...}
<A>__{higher and higher val climbs. he tries not to look down. he's approaching edgar from below and behind. as he gets nearer he begins to notice forboding details: one of edgar's shoes is missing, half the trouser led is torn off.. edgar is strapped to a girder by his belt, his shotgun gripped in his hands. a swarm of flies buzzes away.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{what the hell...}
<A>__{he edges around to where he can see edgar's face the eyes are wide open, staring. he's dead.}
