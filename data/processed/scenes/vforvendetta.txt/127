<A>__{finch shakes his head, reaching for his pipe. he realizes he is out of tobacco. he slides open the bottom desk drawer and his eyes almost pop out of his head. he stares into the drawer like someone staring at his own tombstone.}

<D>__{finch? finch, what's wrong?}
<A>__{slowly, he lifts something from the drawer. on his desk, he lays out several knives, a cloak, a hat, and a smiling mask.}

<D>__{what the hell?}
<A>__{finch lifts the mask and almost has to laugh.}
<C>__{finch}
