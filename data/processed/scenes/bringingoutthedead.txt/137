<C>__{walls}
<D>__{get ready, frank. missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. there's gonna be trauma tonight!}
<C>__{frank}

<C>__{dispatcher}
<D>__{sixteen xray, a man at the bus terminal shot three years ago says his arm hurts.}
<A>__{frank looks at a group of girls exiting an after hours club: every one a rose. rose faces.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{c'mon, tom, pick up a job.}
<C>__{walls}
<D>__{you want some bum in the bus terminal? we'll wait for a real call.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{let's get in a fight, then.}
<C>__{walls}
<D>__{who with?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's your job. just keep driving, keep moving. no stopping. we're sharks. we stop too long, we die.}
<A>__{walls hits the accelerator: the old bus jerks forward:}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{let's break something, tom. let's bust something, bomb something.}
<C>__{walls}
<D>__{what do you want to break?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(taking a drink)}
<D>__{i don't know let's break some windows.}
<C>__{walls}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{destruction, distraction. i feel the need.}
<C>__{walls}
<D>__{you need a reason, frank. you don't just go around breaking people's windows. that's anarchy.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what's the reason? give me a reason, tom.}
<C>__{walls}
<D>__{let me think.}
<A>__{tom hits the siren as he swings wildly around a stopped cab and its turban headed driver:}
<C>__{walls }
<D>__{classic cabbie move.}
<P>__{(to driver)}
<D>__{hey, swammy, that's called a crosswalk. you stop before it, not on it!}
<A>__{walls turns onto a cross street, spots noel standing by a mustang, baseball bat on his shoulder. he wears yesterday's blood stained clothes, cut tires tied to his shoulders and elbows, chest and belly wrapped with steel wire.}
<C>__{walls }
<D>__{i know who to work over. him.}
<A>__{walls slows as noel lifts the bat, swings it into the mustang's front window, shattering it, puts the bat down, using it like a cane as he walks to the next parked car.}
<C>__{walls }
<D>__{this guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. the term "menace to society" was made up for him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he's crazy. he can't help it.}
<C>__{walls}
<P>__{(stops ambulance)}
<D>__{well, why don't they put him away? prisons don't want him. i took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.}
<A>__{noel reaches the next car, a bronco, carefully hefts the bat, smashes it through the windshield.}
<C>__{walls }
<D>__{look at that. tell me that's a crazy person. every move is calculated. he knows exactly what he's doing. this is the guy. i've been after him for weeks. he's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay, whatta i do?}
<C>__{walls}
<D>__{if he sees me, he'll run, so i will get out here. you start talking to him about baseball or something while i sneak around behind and get down and you push him. when he falls we get him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's ridiculous.}
<C>__{walls}
<D>__{believe me, it always works. the simpler, the better.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you learn that in the army?}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{flatbush.}
<A>__{walls slips out, crouches beside the bus. frank, stepping out, walks over to noel as he whacks the bat through the hatch of a pinto.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{that's a hell of a swing you got there, noel. i'm thinking strawberry in his prime.}
<C>__{noel}
<D>__{strawberry ain't shit. drug pussy.}
<P>__{(heads for the next car)}
<D>__{me. i swing like reggie. mr. october. number three, game six, world series.}
<A>__{noel hauls back, lays into a volvo: glass shatters. noel holds the bat out, extends handle towards frank:}
<C>__{noel }
<D>__{here, you try.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, i'd better not.}
<C>__{noel}
<D>__{sure, sure, give go.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{frank, intrigued by noel's suggestion, has forgotten walls' plan. he takes the bat as tom sneaks behind noel, crouching.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{what the hell.}
<P>__{(spits into hands)}
<D>__{the next year, tiebreaker for the division, in boston, yanks down two to nothing, bucky dent steps to the plate.}
<C>__{noel}
<D>__{oh man, bucky.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{the pitch, high heater. bucky knows what's coming. he steps in, smash, over the green monster.}
<A>__{frank cocks the baseball bat, relishing every moment, swings into the volvo's side window. shattered glass flies on his hands and clothes. walls, fed up with this, stands:}
<C>__{walls}
<D>__{frank, what the hell are you doing?}
<A>__{noel, seeing walls, grabs the bat, flees down an alley.}
<C>__{walls }
<D>__{you go down those stairs there. meet me back here if you can't find him in ten minutes. call out if you see him. get with the program, frank.}
<A>__{walls takes off after noel. frank, taking out his flashlight, enters second alley, walks down dark stairs which hopefully circle around to noel.}
