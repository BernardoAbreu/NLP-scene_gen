<L>__{exterior museum night (a little later)}
<A>__{a taxi pulls up, dana jumps out and rushes into the museum. the moment the door closes behind her, there is a loud thunderclap, the ground trembles and a massive amount of slime erupts from around the base of the museum and starts covering the walls, sealing her inside the building.}

<L>__{interior parkview psychiatric padded room night (same time)}
<A>__{venkman, stantz, spengler and winston are in a padded cell. they are handcuffed and the cuffs are chained to thick leather belts around their waists. venkman stands there banging his head into the padded wall while the others try to explain the situation to a skeptical psychiatrist.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{we think the spirit of vigo the carpathian is alive in a painting at the manhattan museum.}
<C>__{psychiatrist}
<D>__{i see. and are there any other paintings in the museum with bad spirits in them?}
<C>__{spengler}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{you're wasting valuable time! we have reason to believe that vigo is drawing strength from a psychomagnetheric slime flow that's been collecting under the city.}
<C>__{psychiatrist}
<D>__{yes, tell me about the slime.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{it's potent stuff. we made a toaster dance with it, then a bathtub tried to eat his friend's baby.}
<A>__{the psychiatrist looks at venkman.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{don't look at me. i think they're nuts.}
