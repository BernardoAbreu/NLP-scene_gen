<A>__{which goes from the beach up to erica's deck. harry stands at the bottom of the stairs in his robe, velvet slippers and sunglasses.' he looks up to the top of the stairs as if it's mt. everest. bravely, he climbs the first few steps. not bad. after two more, he's out of breath. determined, he holds onto the railing and drags himself up to the next step. happy with himself, he holds on for dear life and drags himself up one more...and then, he's so out of breath, he can barely move, yet he reaches up the railing and tries to hike himself up one more.}
