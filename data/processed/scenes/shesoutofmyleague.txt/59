<L>__{interior kirk's parents' kitchen night}
<A>__{kirk, molly, mr. & mrs. kettner, marnie, ron and debbie sit around the kitchen table and feast on a meatloaf dinner. eric is at the fridge grabbing a beer. marnie is angrily watching ron whose eyes are all over molly.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you want another one dad?}
<C>__{mr. kettner}
<D>__{you read my mind.}
<C>__{mrs. kettner}
<D>__{you two take it easy now. we have guests. (then) eric honey, i'm sure if you apologize to leroy, he'll take you back.}
<A>__{eric returns to the table with the beers.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{nah, fuck him. anyways, leroy ain't payin' shit ever since he trucked in all those spics from fresno.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{geeze eric!}
<A>__{ron looks offended and raises a palm to indicate that...}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{i got this, kirk. eric, before you go bad mouthin' a whole group of people, you should know that my grandmother on my father's side is from fresno.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{hey, i'm sorry. i didn't know.}
<P>__{(then) so, molly. what do you do?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i'm an event planner.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you see? that's using your head. that's a business to get into.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{well, thank you eric.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{book a band, blow up a few balloons and people pay out the ass for it.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{there's a little more to it than that, eric. molly handles some big events. she's even doing a benefit with billy joel next month.}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(playfully)}
<D>__{actually, eric's right. just a few balloons.}
<A>__{molly smiles to reassure kirk that she can handle herself.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{you know, molly, i'm a business owner myself. a little restaurant.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{i wouldn't really call it a restaurant, ron.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{we serve food that people eat. so restaurant.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{it's a pizza hut with no tables. it's a take out place.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{so, molly, me and debbie here are getting hitched. what do you get for a wedding job?}
<A>__{kirk raises his eyebrows into "please behave yourself" puppy dog eyes. eric shoots back an "oh whatever" sneer.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{hmmm. honestly, i don't really do a lot of weddings. i specialize more in fund raisers, corporate events, that kind of thing.}
<C>__{molly }
<D>__{right now i'm working on the annual benefit for the children's cancer center.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{but you've done weddings.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i've done a few.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{so, what do you get for one?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{dad, could you...}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{don't get your panties in a wad, kirk. he's just making conversation.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{geeze, there are so many factors that affect the cost of a wedding.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{we're looking at about two hundred people and we're gonna do this whole nascar theme.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i'm getting a kick ass dress made out of actual checkered flags and eric is going to be in an orange tux with a big home depot logo on the back and tony stewart's number 20 on the shoulders.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh, how fun!}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{so what's the damage for supervising something like that?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{eric, please.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i'm just talkin' ballpark. i'm ain't gonna try and jew her down.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{okay. before expenses, my base fee for a non charity event is fifteen thousand. so, i'd ballpark that somewhere around twenty five grand.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{fuck a duck.}
<A>__{for a moment everyone is chewing and there is a break in the conversation. kirk is getting wound up tighter and tighter.}
<C>__{eric }
<D>__{so you're making a comfortable living, you seem like you got your head together more or less and christ, look at ya. what the hell you doing with numbnuts here?}
<C>__{mrs. kettner}
<D>__{eric!}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{come on, ma we're all thinking it.}
<C>__{mrs. kettner}
<D>__{molly, i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{no, it's fine. the truth is, kirk and i are just getting to know one another but so far, i think he's decent, he's funny and... you know, when we first met, kirk asked me in all sincerity if i knew how to do an oil change.}
<A>__{eric, ron and mr. kettner each let out a quick burst of "yeah right" laughter.}
<C>__{molly }
<D>__{i know! and, you're right, i don't but... i just love that he asked.}
<A>__{a moment passes as they all process this. the women at the table all know exactly what molly means. the men are simply confused.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{funny? kirk is funny? tell us a joke there sinbad.}
<C>__{mrs. kettner}
<P>__{(to kirk) well i hope you can hold onto this one pumpkin. (to molly)}
<D>__{when marnie broke up with him he was devastated for months, the poor little guy.}
<A>__{marnie looks up, surprised and touched by the comment. kirk is mortified.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{no shit, when you dump him, he's liable to kill himself.}
<A>__{kirk rubs his own head to keep it from exploding. molly calms him with a hand on his back. this move isn't lost on marnie.}
