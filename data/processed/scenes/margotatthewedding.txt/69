<L>__{interior volvo day}
<A>__{the speedometer needle wavers around 30. margot clutches the steering wheel. claude looks morose. pauline and ingrid sit stonily in the back seat. the volvo jerks into the oncoming lane and back. margot draws a deep breath.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i thought you couldn't drive.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{i can drive. why does everyone say that? i used to drive.}
<A>__{they inch up a small hill. a car cascades down past them. the volvo shakes. pauline suddenly snaps out of her daze:}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{we have to call people and cancel.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{what happened? can i still sing?}
<A>__{margot rolls down the window.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(to claude)}
<D>__{you do smell.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{well, i'm not wearing any deodorant.}
<A>__{they reach the top of the hill, over the crest, and descend. the vehicle picks up speed. margot presses down on the brake.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i don't think...}
<P>__{(she pumps again)}
<D>__{no... we don't have brakes.}
<C>__{pauline}
<P>__{(resigned)}
<D>__{the brakes are bad, that's right.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{what do you think it means?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i mean, what can we do?}
<A>__{the car coasts faster down the hill.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{mom.}
<A>__{margot places her arm stiffly across claude's front. pauline wraps her body around her daughter. margot swerves into the shoulder she makes a sharp turn into the forest and crashes through the bramble and muck. the car slows until it comes to a sudden stop at the base of a tree.}
