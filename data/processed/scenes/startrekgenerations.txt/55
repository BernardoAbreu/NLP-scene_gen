<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior ten forward}
<A>__{the room is bustling with patrons and activity. data enters with an odd look on his face...his body language subtly altered. he is looking at the world through new eyes. geordi is following him closely, watching his every move. they move to the bar. guinan comes over she has not aged at all since the enterprise b. she sets down an exotic looking container full of dark liquid.}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{you two just volunteered to be my first victims.}
<P>__{(re: liquid)}
<D>__{this is a new concoction i picked up on forcas three. trust me, you're going to love it.}
<A>__{she pours two glasses of the liquid. data takes one and sniffs it, then takes a drink. geordi watches him closely. data frowns.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{well...?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{really? what do you feel?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i am uncertain. i have had little experience with emotions... i am unable to articulate the sensation.}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{emotions?}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{i will explain later...}
<A>__{data finishes the drink... concentrates, tries to make sense of the rush of feelings. his expression is one of disgust.}
<C>__{guinan}
<P>__{(to geordi)}
<D>__{i don't think he likes it.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{yes. that is it. i hate it.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{data, i think the chip is working...}
<A>__{data looks at geordi with a big smile on his face.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{yes. i hate this! it is revolting!}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{guinan}
<D>__{another round?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{in the b.g., we see picard enter ten forward.}
<B>__{follow picard}
<A>__{as he walks through ten forward and heads toward a table by the windows. soran is sitting at the table, staring out at the stars, lost in thought. his observatory uniform is distinctive, and sets him apart from everyone else in the room. picard walks up to the table.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{doctor soran...?}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{yes, yes, captain thank you for coming.}
<A>__{the men shake hands and picard sits down. soran is an imposing physical presence, but at the moment he seems very much the eccentric scientists consumed with his work. picard waves away a waiter.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{nothing for me.}
<P>__{(brusque, to soran)}
<D>__{i understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{yes. i need to return to the observatory immediately. i must continue a critical experiment i was running on the amargosa star.}
<A>__{picard's reaction is a little impatient this doesn't sound that imperative to him.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{doctor... we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. until then }
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{the timing is very important on my experiment if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{we're doing the best we can. now if you'll excuse me...}
<A>__{picard moves to stand, but soran reaches out and gently but firmly grabs him by the arm. the unexpected physical contact and the change of intensity in soran's face stops picard in his tracks.}
<C>__{soran}
<P>__{(cryptically)}
<D>__{they say time is the fire in which we burn... and right now, captain, my time is running out.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we leave so many things unfinished in our lives i'm sure you can understand.}
<A>__{for some reason, soran's words have struck a deep chord within picard. he looks away from soran's compelling gaze and thinks for a long moment. when he finally speaks, his voice is barely above a whisper.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i will see what i can do...}
<A>__{picard walks away without a word before soran can thank him. soran looks after him with relief, then pulls out an antique pocket watch and opens it. he looks at the watch for a long moment. then snaps it closed and head for the opposite exit from the one picard took. follow soran across ten forward...until he suddenly stops in shock at something he sees... soran's pov of guinan, who is now back at the bar.}
<B>__{resume soran}
<A>__{a dark look crosses his face he is disturbed by the sight of guinan. he quickly turns and exits.}
<B>__{on guinan}
<A>__{she begins to sense something, as though someone is watching her. she turns, looks in the direction where soran was just standing, but there's no one there now. she shakes off the feeling and goes back to work.}
