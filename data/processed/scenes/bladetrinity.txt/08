<A>__{danica steps into a nearly pitch black "clean room". we hear breathing. despite her calm demeanor, she's frightened. from the darkness, someone speaks a voice low and rumbling, laced with an ominous gravity.}

<D>__{why have you woken me?}
<C>__{danica}
<D>__{your people need you, sire.}
<A>__{she kneels, bowing her head.}
<C>__{voice }
<P>__{(mocking)}
<D>__{"my people". you think i'm your messiah? your savior?}
<A>__{we hear movement. a pair of red eyes pierce the gloom and god help us, even though he remains partially shadowed, this guy has to be the scariest mother fucker we've ever seen.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{what makes you think i wanted to be brought back?}
<A>__{a hand emerges from the darkness, armored. danica wants to bolt. instead, she fights to keep herself from flinching as a taloned finger brushes her throat.}
<C>__{danica}
<D>__{times have changed. science has made great strides. your blood, the sacrament you provide it can set us free now.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i see. and the one i killed earlier? he was vampire?}
<P>__{(off her nod)}
