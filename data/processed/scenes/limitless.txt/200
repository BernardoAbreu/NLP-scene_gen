<L>__{interior a large, casual office day}
<A>__{eddie comes in to find john steadman, 50's, well dressed and gentlemanly, waiting.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{mr. morgan.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{nice to see you.}
<A>__{he shakes steadman's hand, but steadman doesn't get up. odd. in fact steadman looks uncommonly relaxed, almost slouched in his chair, looking up at eddie with a subtle gleam in his eye that eddie doesn't recognize.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{we appreciate everything you've done for us }
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{well, you've done most of it for yourself. senator morgan.}
<A>__{he says this with a kind of casual, prescient authority. and suddenly, we know he's right. eddie will win.}
<C>__{steadman }
<D>__{i mean, everything from here's a technicality, isn't it, eddie?}
<A>__{again, that smile. eddie doesn't know what this guy is about. and nobody calls him "eddie" any more.}
<C>__{steadman }
<D>__{i think we both know where it's heading...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{if... you can maintain.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{maintain?}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{eventually you'll run out. i just want you to know we're here to help you.}
<A>__{eddie blinks at him. did he just say what eddie thought he said?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{we've gotten most of the bugs out. it's longer lasting you'll only have to take one a week.}
<A>__{eddie is now dead silent. a long beat. is it possible? is he really talking to someone who makes mdt?!}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{have you been watching me from the beginning?}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{no. those of you who indulged... distinguished yourselves very quickly. you made yourselves clear to us.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{who's "us?"}
<A>__{steadman just smiles, waves the question away.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{you went the furthest with it the fastest, so of course, to us, you're the most interesting.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{how did it get on the street?}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{security breach. that was never our intention. we took care of it.}
<A>__{meaning, they took care of vern.}
<C>__{steadman }
<D>__{it will never again be on the street. it will never publicly exist. obviously i don't need to detail the advantages for you.}
<A>__{a long beat. eddie doesn't trust this guy not a bit.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{and what about for you? why don't you take it?}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{we don't have to. you'll take it for us.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{and in return...? i do what.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{just keep on doing what you're doing. we won't bother you much at first.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{and later...? what will you be "bothering" me with?}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{well, given where you're heading, some of our ideas are... grandiose. but, i think, achievable.}
<A>__{eddie takes that in.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{and if i don't like your ideas?}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{then we'll say godspeed. and your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely, light.}
<A>__{eddie knows now. they own his ass.}
<C>__{steadman }
<D>__{but let's not even go there. right now you should feel relieved, your problems are over. we just want to keep you healthy... and brilliant.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{luckily i can do that myself.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{well, no, ah, that won't be the case. we shut your lab down this morning.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{my lab?}
<A>__{steadman nods.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{which one?}
<A>__{steadman doesn't blink.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{all of them.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you sure?}
<A>__{steadman suddenly chuckles not at all concerned by this. even amused.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{we were right about you eddie you're gonna go all the way. let's not do anything to jeopardize that. there's no downside here we're offering you a limitless supply with fewer side effects. i think you'll be pleased with the arrangement.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{come on, let's get some lunch. i'm starving...}
<A>__{he heads for the door. eddie remains still.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{tell me something.}
<A>__{steadman stops, looks back at him.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{did i kill that woman?}
<A>__{steadman looks puzzled that eddie would ask.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{do you really want to know?}
<A>__{eddie thinks. no, he doesn't.}
