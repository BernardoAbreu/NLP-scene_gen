<D>__{you would think he's done enough.}
<A>__{shane turns and sees her. she's as fetching as ever.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{mcginty, i mean.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i was kind of thinking the same thing.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{my theory is he came out of retirement to see if he could win with losers.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{oh, shit. i'm sorry. i didn't mean...}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{hey, it's okay. i've been called worse.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{like after that sugar bowl game? i guess you could survive anything after that.}
<A>__{shane has to actually smile at this.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{sometimes i feel like everybody in the world saw that game. like i could go to india and some little guy would run up to me and say, 'boy, did you suck in the '92 sugar bowl.'}
<A>__{annabelle laughs.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{so, how come you're such a fan?}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{my dad. he's a huge redskin fan. for years. he's in his twenty ninth year at the senate office building. as a guard, not a senator. the only thing that keeps him going he says, is me and the redskins. that's where i get it. my fan ness.}

<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{break a leg tomorrow.}

<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{it's from the theater. for opening night. you say the worst thing that can happen. and it won't. break a leg.}
