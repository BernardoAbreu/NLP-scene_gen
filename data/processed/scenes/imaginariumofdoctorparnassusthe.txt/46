<A>__{doctor parnassus is groaning and clutching his head. he has a fierce hangover. he pours some powder from a packet into a glass of water, stirs it with his finger and knocks it back. he grimaces and shudders. a hatch shutter on the small window behind him slides open to reveal the grinning head of mr nick.}
<C>__{mr nick}
