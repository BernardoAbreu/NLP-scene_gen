<B>__{darkness.}
<A>__{a scream rises to an ominous crescendo as we shock cut into : montage of fast moving clips. death, destruction, fear. all images taken from the previous ten friday the 13ths. again, darkness.}
<T>__{open on:}
<A>__{the year is 2455. the place is old earth. barren, void of life, a hazardous and violent planet. the sky is blood red with spiked clouds of dark gray. it is beautiful, but frighteningly foreign. blue lightning crackles as several figures rush through a dust storm below. small groups of people, wearing thick dusters, goggles and masks, work nearby. some dig in the cracked earth, others take assorted readings with strange devices. this is an archeological expedition.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior dark place}
<A>__{the dust storm rages outside. two figures are looking closely at a small object buried in the dirt. one of them pulls a device out of their pouch and slowly, gently picks up the object. the other uses a magnetic tool to remove the dirt.}
<C>__{female voice}
<D>__{careful . . .}
<C>__{male voice}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{they take off their masks and goggles. they are both young. adrienne female (17) watches as stoney male (18) studies the object closely.}
<C>__{stoney}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{not guaranteed, if used after 2198.}
<A>__{close up of the object. it's an unopened condom.}
<C>__{adrienne}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you thinking what i'm thinking?}
<A>__{stoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open the condom as adrienne rips her clothes off.}
<B>__{pull back to reveal}
<A>__{they are in a half buried mini van. it rocks violently from the raging storm outside and from the raging lust inside.}
<B>__{back inside the van.}
<C>__{adrienne}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{what about kkinsa?}
<A>__{stoney is desperately trying to take off her bra.}
<C>__{stoney}
<D>__{it's over between us. you're the only one for me!}
<A>__{metal screeches! the floor collapses! they fall some ten feet, rubble raining down on top of them.}

<A>__{a rusty metal ladder. debris everywhere. half inch layers of dust cover everything. dead. lifeless.}
<C>__{stoney}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{adrienne sits up, shines her light down the long metal corridor. she turns her light on stoney then sees something over his shoulder.}
<B>__{she screams a blood curdling scream.}
<A>__{we pull back, out of the tunnel, through the van as the sounds of the storm drown out adrienne's scream.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior base camp}
<A>__{the digging and readings have stopped. a group approaches a time scarred shuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly. fat lou (40), rail thin, possible female, pilot, appears at the top of the shuttle ramp.}

<D>__{there!}
<A>__{kicker(30), bulky, short on temper, rushes up wearing futuristic military garb }

<D>__{we're missing two of the kids!}

<D>__{not without me!}
<A>__{the rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the van.}
<L>__{interior ancient corridor}

<B>__{crystal lake research facility.}
<A>__{they all take off the goggles and masks. the rest of the group consists of delongpre(18) good looking, smart ass; janessa(17) sexual, scheming azrael(17) small, cocky; kkinsa(16), insecure, problematic; thorgan(17), a nerd but doesn't know it.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{amazing! but, how . . i've been coming here for ten years. we never picked this up on our . . . kay em?}
<A>__{kay em 14, a cybernetics science droid, removes her veil. she's gorgeous, but there's something off about her look. something synthetic.}
<D>__{kay em 14 the air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{somebody wanted the place to stay hidden. kay em 14 in twenty eighty two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .}
<C>__{kicker}
<D>__{all right, all right, enough with the history lesson. lets find these two quick . . so i can kick some little punk ass.}
<A>__{kkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel.}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{i have an idea, why don't you go find them and we'll get the hell out of here!}
<A>__{kkinsa turns and finds herself face to face with a corpse! easily two hundred years old it hangs from the wall, impaled through the forehead by an iron spike. kkinsa screams! kicker yanks a weapon from his back, locks and loads as janessa falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse. she screams! kay em 14 screams at the top of her lungs. everyone looks at the droid.}
<D>__{kay em 14 was that out loud?}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{thorgan, have you been screwing with . . .}
<A>__{thorgan grabs the head off the corpse, with the spike through it's head.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{cool! this is an automatic "a".}
<A>__{azrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground, an old boot, some cds, and an ancient box of playtex . . . starts shoving the corpse into his pack.}

<C>__{kicker}
<D>__{back to the shuttle! all of you! i will find them.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{relax, soldier boy, this is amazing. these remains are two hundred years old.}
<A>__{yllo's light hits a sign hanging from the ceiling. danger. stay out.}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{creepy.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{okay, i'm outta here.}
<C>__{yylo}
<D>__{kay em, any thoughts? kay em 14 girth is better than length and women prefer a shaved scrotum during oral sex.}
<A>__{yllo glares a thorgan.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{i'm trying to give her some personality.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{well stop messing with her. i don't want a science droid with a personality. now let's find them and get back. i want to get clearance to stay back and study this . . .}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{no way! i'm not staying here any longer . . . i have a life you know.}
<A>__{a radio crackles.}
<C>__{fat lou}
<D>__{hey teach! this rock's starting to freeze! get your ass back hre!}
<C>__{yllo}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{keep your shirt on! i'm working on it. you won't believe what we found.}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{adrienne! stoney!}
<A>__{yllo rushes past the corpse. the others reluctantly follow. they pass another hanging sign danger they pass another corpse lying on the floor, it's torso separated from it's legs. and this is just the beginning. as they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere.}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{there was a hall of a battle down here.}
<A>__{s they move further they break a laser beam . . . sparks fly. a warning voice sounds.}
<C>__{computer voice}
<D>__{dan danger. do not enter er.}
<A>__{but the group keeps moving.}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{i feel compelled to ask why we are ignoring that.}
<A>__{a corpse lies on the floor before them, it's skeletal hand beneath a warning written in ancient blood . . .}
<B>__{help me . . .}
<A>__{suddenly another corpse leaps at them, screaming like a banshee! everyone screams it lands on kkinsa, who totally freaks trying to get the corpse off her. delongpree and yllo help kkinsa fight the rotting corpse. they hear hysterical laughter and look up to see adrienne and stoney . . . emerge from the shadows laughing uncontrollably.}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{damnit!}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{what the hell are you two doing?!}
<A>__{kkinsa eyes adrienne, then glares at stoney.}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{you're toast, mister.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{you're both toast!}
<C>__{adrienne}
<D>__{you gotta see this!}
<A>__{they turn down the right corridor, passing beneath ceiling consisting of a jumbled mess of jagged metal.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<P>__{(re: ceiling)}
<D>__{that's a strange design, don't you think?}
<C>__{kicker}
<D>__{we don't have time for this shit.}
<A>__{as they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and squeeze together. that can't be a good thing . . . stoney and adrienne stop at a huge metal door. above the door . . .}
<B>__{cryogenics lab.}
<A>__{adrienne points to a small window in the door.}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{yeah, so? i had cryo 101 last year.}
<C>__{adrienne}
<D>__{check it out.}
<A>__{with a smirk, adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in the door. drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning }
<B>__{a skull and crossbones}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{so don't open the door.}
<C>__{adrienne}
<D>__{look beyond it, yesterday's news.}
<A>__{yllo pushes his way to the window. shocked faces. inside the blue tinted room we see a huge domed cryo cylinder. it's massive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. curled up into a ball, is a body female, young.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{is that? kay em 14 the room's still operational. she's perfectly preserved.}
<A>__{yllo's face lights up, grabs his radio.}
<C>__{yllo}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{fat lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. call grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!}
<C>__{kicker}
<D>__{now wait a minute! i don't think you should open that door.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{this is a science excursion corporal. just stay out of the way.}
<A>__{yllo turns to the kids. he's very excited.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{okay, no screwing around. this is the real thing. do exactly what i say. okay thorgan, open it up.}
<A>__{thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget.}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{you're opening the door? what about the . . . ?}
<A>__{she points to the skull and crossbones.}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{i'm thinking we should call in some experts.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{this is your find people. you want to give your credit away?}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{i was just saying . . .}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{the cryo unit leaked. the computers sealed the room. no airborne viruses no hazardous materials. i've shut down the until. alright, stand back. kay em 14 hold your breath. initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{knock you on your ass pal.}
<A>__{they don their face masks as . . . fshhhhhshshsh. the metallic door cracks open causing a powerful backdraft. the freezing cold air mixes with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas. ice crystals crack and fall to the floor.}
<L>__{exterior cryo cell}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{kay em!}
<A>__{kay moves into the room ahead of the others.}
<L>__{interior cryo cell}
<A>__{close on kay em's eyes they are not human. mechanical, digital, but alluring. they dilate, open up. colored lasers shoot forth, slicing through the gas, scanning the body. which itself is slumped over. an icicle of frozen blood from, the wound in her shoulder, props the body up. the other enter the icy chamber.}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{i speak on behalf of the group when i say . . . that's fucked. kay em 14 female, nineteen years old, eight months . . . 34 26 34 . . . bitch is built like a brick shit house.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{thorgan?!!!}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{sorry. i will fix her when we get back. kay em 14 time of hibernation 2049. crystallization at seventeen percent. suggest extensive nanotech. chances of rejuvenation eight one percent.}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{she's dying.}

<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{janessa, stretcher.}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{keep your shirt on, sergeant. we have a medical emergency here not tot mention the discovery of a lifetime.}
<C>__{sergeant brodski}
<D>__{kicker! get them the hell out of there!}
<A>__{janessa removes a metallic cube from her backpack, clicks a button and a flat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground. kicker grabs yllo.}
<C>__{kicker}
<D>__{we're outta here!}
<A>__{yllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of blood and crack breaks it off.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{fine, grab that end.}
<A>__{kicker sighs and helps yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled body on the stretcher.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as thorgan stands at the massive cryo unit }
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{hey check this out!}
<A>__{protruding from the door is the tip of a machete.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{this caused the leak and there's an occupant.}
<A>__{thorgan yanks the door open.}
<C>__{kicker}
<D>__{don't touch that!}
<A>__{gas rolls out. suddenly alarms sound and lights strobe.}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{this is bad, no?}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{relax, it's only a glitch in the system.}
<C>__{janessa}
<D>__{first field trip and you think you're a scientist. move out of the way geek.}
<A>__{janessa moves to look inside the chamber. as the gas and steam clear we hear the sound of cracking ice, see a jagged mass of frozen crystals . . . and within it . . . a body. a chunk of ice cracks and falls tot he floor then the mask of jason voorhees looms forward! janessa screams as jason's body, stiff as a board, crashes to the ground sending ice shrapnel everywhere!}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{jesus, used to make the suckers big didn't they?}
<A>__{again, kay em's eyes scan the frozen body.}
<D>__{kay em 14 subject was dead prior to incubation.}
<A>__{yllo moves to get a good look at jason.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{my god, look at him. why would they freeze a dead body?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{alright, load him up, and let's get out of here!}
<A>__{over his shoulder hall a pair of three foot metallic spiders drop on thin wires to the floor.}

<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{er, guy? i'm picking up some movement.}

<C>__{kicker}
<D>__{they're only class two. i can handle this. no problem.}
<C>__{azrael}
<D>__{not a problem?!}
<A>__{kay em injects him again.}

<C>__{kicker}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{kicker throws open the door and starts blasting! yllo and the kids follow him into the hall, the two stretches in tow. they disappear around the bend towards the exit. a beat then . . . screaming. they run back into view. behind them clink, clink, clink, clink, clink. a dozen laser wielding spiders make chase! some are old and rusty, other slump over and short out, but those that work . . . work well.}
<L>__{interior long coridoor}

<D>__{what's the point?}
<A>__{delongpre shrugs.}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{so that's it then.}
<A>__{it seems it is. janessa stands over yllo's decapitated body. it's obvious their relationship went beyond just teacher student. there is a loud metallic whine from the ship's hull.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{that's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship. kay em 14 no...}

<D>__{am i in there? kay em 14 sory...}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{that's a good fantasy, though. kinky, but good.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{hey!!}
<A>__{all heads turn to rizzo. she's staring at a schematic of the ship. the left hull of the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the various system failures. rizzo points to the right hull.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{it's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.}
<A>__{rizzo points at the thin walk ways connecting the two hulls.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{can we get through these?}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{sure but what good will that do?}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{when the left hull goes, so will the right.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{what if we blow the walkways first? leave jason over here to go up with the ship?}
<A>__{they stare at her.}
<C>__{janessa}
<D>__{you know, yllo seemed to think we could catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth millions.}

<D>__{any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.}
<C>__{janessa}
<D>__{i'm just saying.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<P>__{(to others)}
<D>__{come on. you got all these gadgets and shit. why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{we'd need charges.}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{we could convert fission transistors.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{we're not supposed to do that.}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{what are you gonna do, tell me?}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{the engine room will have molecular welders. we could seal up the hull.}
<A>__{a moment of consideration. could this actually work?}
<C>__{janessa}
<D>__{yeah, great idea! and i will keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{would you? kay em 14 now this is getting exciting.}
<C>__{delongpre}
<D>__{remember to roll his balls around a bit.}
<C>__{rizzo}
<D>__{you got a better plan?}
<A>__{obviously they don't. they got to work. boeman grabs a number of devices from under a cabinet.}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{i will need system four converters.}

<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{then you better hurry. i will blow alley one, delongpre, you and rizzo take there. janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.}

<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{come here, might as well fix that arm.}
<L>__{interior cargo bay}
