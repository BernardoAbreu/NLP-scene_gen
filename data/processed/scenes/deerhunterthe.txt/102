<L>__{exterior loading ramp (nick's pov) u.s. military hospital day}
<A>__{black body bags are laid out in countless rows on the hot concrete two pfc's are stacking them on pallets and more pfc's, driving hydraulic lifters, are loading the pallets into the cavernous hold of a huge jet transport.}

<A>__{nick turns away from the window and sits down in the chair. suddenly the door bursts open and a harassed doctor comes in.}

<C>__{doctor }
<D>__{are you sure?}

<C>__{doctor }
<D>__{is this yours?}
<A>__{nick nods.}
<C>__{doctor }
<D>__{this isn't yours. this can't be yours! i'm going to take this one off and cut it up...}
<P>__{(he extracts a pair of scissors and does so)}
<D>__{shred it... so no one gets a hold of it. what i'm going to do now, i'm going to give you this one.}
<P>__{(he staples a new marker around nick's neck)}
<D>__{there. how's that? does that feel better?}
<A>__{nick nods. the doctor directs a finger at him.}
<C>__{doctor }
<D>__{that one's yours.}
<A>__{the doctor slams back out the door. another jet thunders overhead. the hydraulic lifters on the loading ramp shriek and whine... nick reaches for the new paper marker on his neck and peers down at it from the corner of his eye. it seems to remind him of something and he takes out his wallet. in his wallet is a photograph of linda. nick peers at the photograph intently, then closes his wallet and puts it away.}
