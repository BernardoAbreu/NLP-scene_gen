<A>__{will jumps in and starts the engine. as he tucks his "giorgio's" cap onto his head, he catches his reflection in the rear view mirror.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you asshole. you titanic asshole. come on down and get your prize.}
<A>__{he makes his fingers into a gun, puts it to his head...pulls the trigger and boom!}
<C>__{we're in}
<L>__{exterior open field day}
<A>__{a watermelon explodes in a shower of red, juicy bits. loud, dumb laughter echoes. standing 20 yards away is dwayne (32), an intense, meaty guy in a sleeveless baltimore ravens t shirt. on his left bicep is a tattoo of the tasmanian devil flipping the bird.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{fruit motherfuckin' salad!}
<A>__{crouched beside him is jay (27), tall and awkward, in a wool surplus cap. he carefully rigs homemade explosives to another watermelon, then looks up at dwayne. his eyes are magnified into saucers by his thick glasses. there's a peculiar eagerness to please in them.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{this one's gonna blow even bigger.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{boy, if you weren't such a skinny little bitch you coulda been in the military or something.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{whatever. i don't need the military. i taught myself how to do this shit.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i hear that. i taught myself how to eat pussy. and cut my own hair.}
<A>__{jay jogs the watermelon a safe distance away. he returns and pulls out a detonator. dwayne snatches it.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{this one's all me.}
<P>__{(makes "radio" sounds)}
<D>__{mr. president, we have enemies at the gate. give me the order.}
<P>__{(more "radio" sounds)}
<D>__{fuck that, sir. i don't negotiate with terrorists!}
<A>__{dwayne presses a button and boom! the explosion is so powerful that it sprinkles our guys' smiling faces with fruit juice.}
