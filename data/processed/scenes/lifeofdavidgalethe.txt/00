<A>__{a dishevelled woman in a business suit (27) runs down a lonely highway in texas hill country, moving desperately through the thick morning fog. she's carrying a vhs cassette. the sounds of her breathing and shoes hitting the pavement echo into the mist. she runs, and runs. she slows, out of strength, looks up and down the highway. both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a tunnel of fog. she stumbles on, a final effort. she runs. sees something. stops cold.}
