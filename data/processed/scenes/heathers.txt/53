<L>__{interior wetc t.v. station dusk}
<A>__{in a sleek wetc station hallway, veronica sawyer, a guest pass affixed to her heart, holds her hand in a spurting drinking fountain. she watches the water splash her car lighter burn mark.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{ich luge bullets. i'm such a jerk.}
<A>__{peter dawson beams toward her, wearing a guest pass.}
<C>__{peter dawson}
<D>__{veronica, i thought we lost you.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i was waiting for my friend betty.}
<A>__{veronica looks at her watch then joins peter's march down the hall.}
<C>__{peter dawson}
<D>__{teens talking it out on t.v.! would it be pretentious of me to attach a videocassette of the show on my princeton application?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{shucks, that's a great idea, pete.}
<A>__{they burst through the studio double doors.}
<B>__{studio}
<A>__{veronica and peter take in a panorama of attractive, clean cut students from various schools chatting near wine and cheese tables set up to the side of an impressive, elevated, circular stage. all students are wearing pink armbands.}
<C>__{peter dawson}
<D>__{this is excellent, but i thought we were going to get equal representation on this thind: geeks, gearheads...}
<A>__{out of nowhere, a bubbling heather duke knots a pink armband around peter's arm with a giggle.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{they're probably just being fashionably late.}
<A>__{peter dawson prances off with a raucous laugh. veronica stares dumbfounded at the wicked homogeneity of the students as heather duke ties a pink armband on her.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{is this very or what? oh, you've gotta meet whitney james! come on!}
<A>__{heather duke tugs veronica across the crowded studio floor to where the wetc news set is situated. smoking casually in her anchor's chair is the beautiful whitney james.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{whitney, here's my friend.....}
<C>__{whitney james}
<D>__{ah please sit down.}
<A>__{heather duke glides away. veronica uncomfortably steps onto the news set and moves down next to whitney james.}
<C>__{whitney james}
<D>__{i got a confession to make. my name used to be heather, too.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{but my name's not...}
<C>__{whitney james}
<D>__{people just don't take the name heather seriously. they should, shouldn't they?}
<B>__{wine and cheese table}
<A>__{heather mcnamara surreptitiously picks up a bottle of wine and with a sad expression, proceeds to down it.}
<B>__{the news set}
<A>__{veronica apologizes to a blissfully oblivious whitney james.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i'm so sorry. i was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.}
<C>__{whitney james}
<D>__{oh, i was scared of the same thing, heather. the minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.}
<A>__{whitney james tears open a bag of corn nuts and showers some into her mouth. she speaks as she sucks and chews.}
<C>__{whitney james}
<D>__{i'm not knocking teen suicide. it's exciting stuff. my personal faves are those kids from loaded families grabbing the mike to whine how even though they bagged a b.m.w. on their birthday, they're still quote unquote depressed. it's ridiculous. people who say money can't buy happiness don't know where to shop.}
<A>__{whitney james titters. veronica is a statue of mortification.}
