<L>__{interior lounge stairs night}
<A>__{nadia climbs the stairs. john watches her, hovering in the doorway of the darkened lounge. he hears the bathroom door close before venturing up.}
<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{john sits on the edge of his bed. he cocks his head: door opening and shutting; feet padding along landing; door closing. silence. he squeezes his door open and peers down the dark landing. the coast is clear.}
<L>__{interior bathroom day}
<A>__{brushing his teeth, staring accusingly at his reflection. spits. finished, he takes a deep breath and opens the door, and gives a small shout. nadia is standing right outside the door; nightshirt, damp hair, toothbrush in her mouth.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{he squeezes past and quick steps down the landing.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{he climbs into the big bed, fully clothed, turns off the light and lies there in the moonlight. after twenty seconds, the bedroom door clicks open. john climbs out of bed as casually as possible and stands around.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you should go now. we'll talk in the morning.}
<A>__{his eyes widen but he can't speak. he wants to but she's placed her hand across his mouth. she reaches down and takes his hand, and draws it towards her, slowly tracing his fingers across her breasts. she unbuttons her shirt and pulls his hand inside. he's breathing hard, her right hand still clasped over his mouth. her free hand lowers to press against him, and unzip his fly. he lets out a moan. we concentrate on their faces. above the silence all we can hear is john's breathing before long nadia looks down he's come. nadia turns and walks out, leaving john marooned, gasping in and blowing out, angry almost, buttoning his trousers.}
