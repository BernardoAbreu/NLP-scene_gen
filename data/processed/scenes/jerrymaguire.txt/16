<L>__{interior airplane first class night}
<A>__{we move past a snoring businessman, onto tired but adrenalized jerry maguire. he sits in first class, working on his laptop, a pile of newspapers and magazines nearby. the woman passenger next to him, 3oish, finishes up a spicy phone conversation with her boyfriend.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{monkeyface... monkeyface, listen... i'm not going to say it here.... no...}
<A>__{jerry continues to work, as his laptop now beeps. battery's low.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{... oh listen, i got you the perfect white shirt, at this out of the way place... no... quit trying to make me say it!}
<A>__{jerry shuts off his laptop and prepares for sleep. trying not to listen.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{how about if i do it and don't say it... mmmm... see you soon...}
<A>__{she laughs seductively and hangs up. she is still buzzed from the conversation. jerry turns to her, surprising her.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i have to ask.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(protective)}
<D>__{what }
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{where'd you find the perfect white shirt?}
<A>__{she laughs, it's an infectious laugh two strangers enjoying the good life as we drift back three rows, past the panel separating the cool comfort of first class from the stuffy airless and uncomfortable world of coach. we meet dorothy boyd, 26. a harried passenger on this bus in the sky. her clothes are part contemporary, part mother functional. she is never as composed or in control as she wants to be. right now she is devoted to the sneezing kid in the wrinkled white shirt sitting next to her. it is ray, her five year old son. dorothy is covered in toys and books. stuffed into the side pocket is jerry's mission statement. the easy laughter from three rows ahead washes over her like cold water, as she rings again for a flight attendant. the overworked attendant arrives, pissed, snapping off the bell.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{look, my son is allergic to the material in these blankets }
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{that's all we have.}
<A>__{the attendant offers a bundle of soggy cocktail napkins and is about to exit as ray makes a gagging noise. he's about to get sick. both women reach for an airsick bag, and get it to his mouth just in time. their faces are now inches apart.}
<C>__{attendant}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm sorry i was rude just then }
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{it's okay. we're in it together now...}
<A>__{the attendant now exits helpfully with the bag.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{don't take anything i say seriously! i love to flirt!}
<A>__{dorothy, irritated, leans out into the aisle to look for the heads that belong to these voices.}
<B>__{back to jerry and woman}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you're with the sports people on the plane, right?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{jerry maguire. smi.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{bobbi fallon. bpi. i'm producing the coke commercials for the playoffs.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{well. good luck with that }
<A>__{he nods, as he reaches up to shut off the light. politely stifles another yawn. he shuts his eyes, settles into sleep. bobbi leans into his darkness.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{can i just get a quick "man's" opinion from you on something?}
