<A>__{kaufman lies half awake in bed, sweating, his eyes darting back and forth. he looks over at the clock. it's 3:32.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{damn it.}
<A>__{donald snores happily off screen. kaufman switches on a lamp, pulls the orchid thief from his bag, flips through it. there are now many yellow hi lited passages. he reads one.}
<C>__{kaufman }
<D>__{there are too many ideas and things and people, too many directions to go. i was starting to believe the reason it matters to care passionately about something is that it whittles the world down to a more manageable size.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{such sweet, sad insights. so true.}
<A>__{kaufman flips to the glowing, smiling author photo.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{and you're... i like looking at you.}
<A>__{he stares at the photo. its smile broadens. it talks.}
<C>__{orlean photo}
<D>__{i like looking at you, too. charlie.}
<A>__{the photo smiles warmly at him. kaufman begins to jerk off. he closes his eyes. then: kaufman and orlean are in his bed together, making love. she smiles at him throughout. they finish. then: kaufman is alone in bed, heaving. he looks at the still smiling photo. it somehow seems sleepy now.}

<D>__{i don't know how to do this. i'm afraid i will disappoint you. you've written a beautiful book. i can't sleep. i'm losing my hair. i'm fat and repulsive }
<C>__{orlean photo}
<D>__{shhh. you're not. whittle it down, focus on one thing in the story, find the thing you care passionately about and write about that.}
<A>__{kaufman studies her delicate, melancholy face. he's in love.}
<C>__{orlean photo }
<P>__{(sweet, flirty smile)}
