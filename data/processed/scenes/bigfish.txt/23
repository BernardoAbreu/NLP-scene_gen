<D>__{now, it's common knowledge that most towns of a certain size have a witch, if only to eat misbehaving children and the occasional puppy who wanders into her yard. witches use those bones to cast spells and curses that make the land infertile.}
<A>__{we pull back, and back, revealing more of the gothically creepy house: its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie gargoyles half buried in the dirt. even bats are afraid to fly over it. in the moonlight, the house is especially sinister. who knows what is lurking in the shadows?}
<C>__{adult edward }
<D>__{yet of the all the witches in alabama, there was one who was the most feared. for she had one glass eye, which was said to contain mystical powers.}
<A>__{we finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate.}
<C>__{wilbur freely}
<D>__{i hear if you look right at it, you can see how you're gonna die.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{that's bull s h i t, that is. she's not even a real witch.}
<C>__{don price}
<D>__{you're so sure, why don't you go in and get that eye? i heard she keeps it in a box on her nighttable.}
<A>__{edward looks back at the spooky house.}
<C>__{don price}
<D>__{or are you too scared?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i will go in right now and get that eye.}
<C>__{don price}
<D>__{then do it.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{fine, i will.}
<C>__{don price}
<D>__{fine, you do it.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{fine, i'm doing it.}
<A>__{he hands zacky his flashlight, then starts climbing the gate.}
<C>__{ruthie}
<D>__{edward, don't!}
<C>__{wilbur freely}
<D>__{she'll make soap out of you!}
<P>__{(to ruthie)}
<D>__{that's what she does, she makes soap out of people.}
<A>__{edward drops down on the far side of the gate. truth be told, edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway. wilbur looks to ruthie, and they're in complete agreement. they get the hell out of there. zacky would run too, but don holds him by the collar.}
