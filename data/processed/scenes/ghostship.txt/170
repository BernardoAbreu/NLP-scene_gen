<A>__{epps steps into the passageway. directly across is the entry to the swimming pool. she walks on.}
<L>__{interior chimera swimming pool day}
<A>__{epps steps in. light falls in from the dirty port holes at the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls. she holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a girl of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool. epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. she is porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her clothing hanging loosely from a frail body.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{you must leave.}
<A>__{a beat as epps stands there.}
<C>__{epps}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{from this distance and in the light it is hard to fully discern the girl's features.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{there's great evil here, more than you can know. leave now or you may never leave.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{but }
<A>__{a hatch closes somewhere in the ship. epps turns to look. when she turns back the girl is gone. a quiet "tick" sound echoes in the pool. she looks down to see that the pool is now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the depths. and, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising up from the bottom. she steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the top. it is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching the surface. epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles. as she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. the glow spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear that the water is not water at all but blood. and, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up. epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. it is a man, fighting desperately to reach the surface. the bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams. epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same point, a woman, also struggling. another man floats up, then another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{my god....}
<A>__{epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far apart. she struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the surface. the others are fighting for the surface too, as epps reaches out, near tears, helpless to do anything.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{no!!}
<A>__{everything suddenly stops. a beat as epps only holds there. the blood is gone, as are the people. the pool is back to its normal state as though nothing had happened, epps looking on in disbelief.}
<C>__{murphy }
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{epps looks up to see murphy standing at the door.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(looking back to the pool)}
<D>__{yeah, fine.}
<A>__{a beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool.}
