<L>__{interior old opera house men's room night}
<A>__{your standard low class crapper. bryant is planted firmly on the cracked tile floor next to the urinals rubbing his face, trying not to pop the clutch in his anger. this is a public place, he doesn't want to yell.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{just because it's a nexus 6 doesn't change procedure. a little known fact can become a well known fact and part of our job, deckard, is to make sure that doesn't happen. now how can be do that if you blow one away in front of a fuckin' audience.}
<A>__{it's not the sort of question that expects an answer. deckard's washing his face in the basin hoping it'll all go away.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{deckard looks up dripping, reaches for a paper towel. bryant slaps one in his hand.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{she was gonna get away.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{then let her get away. i thought you were a pro you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!}
<A>__{bryant takes a couple of deep breaths.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{i'd say you got a little carried away.}
<A>__{deckard's voice is barely audible.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i didn't like her.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{you didn't like her!?}
<A>__{he slams the handle on one of the urinals.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{you start liking or disliking andies it's time to hang it up.}
<A>__{the plumping roars and sucks and dies. there's nothing to do but nod. deckard nods. poor bastard has had a rough night. bryant pulls a flask out of his coat and hands it to him. deckard puts it to his mouth and bryant watches deckard's adam's apple like he's count ing the swallows. deckard hands it back empty. bryant caps it, puts it back in his pocket.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{look, go home. get some rest. take an aspirin.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{bryant shuffles out like an old bear.}
