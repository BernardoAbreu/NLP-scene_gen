<A>__{in a montage of images and music la boheme is performed. the lights from the stage dance across vivian's face. edward leans over to translate the tenor's aria.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{what am i? i am a poet. not a man of wealth but one rich in dreams. you have come to replace my vanished dreams. i dwell now only in your eyes.}
<A>__{the music ebbs and swells. the sets and costumes change. the story continues. edward again leans close to vivian.}

<D>__{and now she asks rudolpho if he still thinks her beautiful }
<A>__{vivian raises a hand and gently covers edward's mouth. her eyes are fixed on the stage. she doesn't need his help. the emotions building inside vivian swell as the music is reaching its tragic climax. her lips tremble. her eyes fill with tears. edward glances at her. he studies her a long moment, watching the emotions play unashamedly across her face. strangely moved, he takes vivian's hand. as the opera ends, they are both swept away by it.}
