<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{russia. it's like `cancer', i don't even like saying the word.}
<A>__{bloom, stephen and the chink drink in a cramped little concrete room adjacent to the bar's kitchen.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{we're obviously not going to deal with real russians. they'll be our guys in a phony set up, they'll take our phony book and give her phony cash, a closed loop. safe and simple.}
<A>__{bloom looks to the chink for an opinion. gets a blank face.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{so. we go to st. petersburg.}
<A>__{at the mention of st. petersburg bloom looks sharply at stephen, but stephen presses on.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{she does the hand off with our fake "russians." but while we're driving out of town, everything goes bad.}
<A>__{he lays a simple flowchart, drawn on a napkin three boxes. he points to the first, "penelope sells book to `russians'"}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{we discover we were sold a counterfeit book in the first place, which we've now sold to russian smugglers. we discover this when the russian mob starts taking us out one by one. oh shit.}
<A>__{he points to the second box, "red dawn."}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{first they ambush our car, destroying the money. then they take me out, then the chink, and finally you bloom, in a heroic death that allows penelope to barely escape with her life. devastated but reborn with the knowledge that you loved her so much you died so she could live, she drives off into a romantic life of adventure and peril, on the run from imaginary russians.}
<A>__{he points to the third box, "the end."}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{what do you think?}
