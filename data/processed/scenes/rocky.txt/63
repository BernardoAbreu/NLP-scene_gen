<A>__{everyone laughs... dipper moves across the room like a large snake. he brushes people aside and steps behind rocky. he nudges him... rocky thinks it is an accident and ignores it. dipper pushes harder and rocky looks questioningly at him.}
<C>__{dipper}
<P>__{(loud)}

<C>__{dipper}
<P>__{(continuing; insanely)}
<D>__{man, yo' best keep them cameras out! fight me, boy! let creed here see the kind of punk he's fightin'!}

<C>__{dipper}
<D>__{if yo're afraid to fight me, then get down an' kiss my feet, boy.}
<A>__{mickey looks nervously around and knows it's only seconds before the blood will run... rocky stands motionless.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{let's take a walk, rock. please, don't take a chance. he wants to hurt you so you can't fight.}
<A>__{rocky swallows his pride. he still has the string around his ankles. he starts to shuffle away with mickey... dipper steps forward and viciously slaps rocky again. mike jumps forward.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{why you tryin' to cut 'im, man! back off, scumbag, or i will bite your face!}
<A>__{dipper cuts loose with a hook and knocks mike flat. the room reeks of fear... apollo's eyes flick back and forth between rocky and dipper. apollo taps his bodyguards and they begin to ease away.}

<D>__{... now, boy, kiss my feet.}
<A>__{rocky eyes his friend lying on the floor. he shuffles forward and stands before dipper.}
<C>__{dipper}
<P>__{(continuing; almost in a whisper)}
<D>__{... kiss 'em.}
<A>__{rocky looks at mickey, then lowers his eyes to dipper's feet... dipper smiles. rocky starts to bend towards the shoes. without warning, he explodes with a pair of combinations into dipper's exposed ribs. a crack is heard and dipper sinks to the floor writhing in pain... the room is silent except for dipper's moaning. apollo is stunned by the scene. the gym has become a very gloomy place. he eyes rocky with admiration and a hint of apprehension... he leaves. mickey is the first one to shake off the chill... he shakes his fists at the reporters, and puts his arm around rocky.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{the kid's got cannons print that.}
<A>__{the crowd disperses, leaving dipper a pathetic and broken figure lying on a dirty gym floor.}
