<T>__{we intercut:}
<A>__{ the princess, in helpless agony, hearing the distant noise from her room in the palace... hamish and stephen, disguised as peasants among the crowd, helpless too, but there, as if to shoulder some of the pain. longshanks, rattling, coughing blood, as edward watches. robert the bruce paces along the walls of his castle in scotland. his eyes are haunted; he grips the embroidered handkerchief that belonged to wallace.}
<B>__{on the execution stand}
<A>__{a trio of burly hooded executioners cinch a rope around wallace's neck and hoist him up a pole.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{that's it! stretch him!}
<A>__{in the score, amazing grace, wailed on bagpipes, carries through all that happens now... ties hand and foot, wallace is strangling. the magistrate watches coldly; even when the executioner gives him a look that says they're about to go too far, he prolongs the moment; then the magistrate nods and the executioner cuts the rope. wallace slams to the platform; the magistrate leans to him.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{pleasant, yes? rise to your knees, kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, and you will feel no more.}
<A>__{with great effort, wallace rises to his knees. the magistrate assumes a formal posture and offers the cloak. wallace struggles all the way to his feet.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{very well then. rack him.}
<A>__{the executioners slam wallace onto his back on the table, spread his arms and legs, and tie each to a crank. goaded by the crowd, they pull the ropes taut. they crowd grows quiet enough to hear the groaning of wallace's limbs. hamish and stephen feel it in their own bodies.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{wonderful, isn't it, that a man remains conscious through such pain. enough?}
<A>__{wallace shakes his head. the executioners cut off his clothes, take hot irons from a fire box. the crowd grows silent; we see them, not wallace, as the irons are touched to his body, but we hear the burning of flesh. then the magistrate signals; wallace wants to say something.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{that... will... clear your sinuses.}
<A>__{everyone hears; hamish smiles, even through his tears. rebuffed, the magistrate nods to the executioners, who lift the terrible instruments of dissection. we are spared seeing the cutting: we are on wallace's face as the disembowelment begins. the magistrate leans in beside him.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{it can all end. right now! bliss. peace. just say it. cry out. "mercy!" yes?... yes?}
<A>__{the crowd can't hear the magistrate but they know the procedure, and they goad wallace, chanting...}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{mer cy! mer cy! mer cy!}
<A>__{wallace's eyes roll to the magistrate, who signals quiet!}
<C>__{magistrate}
<P>__{(booming)}
<D>__{the prisoner wishes to say a word!}
<A>__{silence. hamish and stephen weep, whisper, pray...}
<C>__{hamish and stephen}
<D>__{mercy, william... say mercy...}
<A>__{wallace's eyes flutter, and clear. he fights through the pain, struggles for one last deep breath, and screams...}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{freeeee dommmmmm!}
<A>__{the shout rings through the town. hamish hears it. the princess hears it, at her open window, and touches her tummy, just showing the first signs of her pregnancy. longshanks and his son seem to hear; the cry still echoes as if the wind could carry it through the ends of scotland; and robert the bruce, on the walls of his castle, looks up sharply, as if he has heard...}
<B>__{in the london square}
<A>__{the crowd has never seen courage like this; even english strangers begin to weep. the angry, defeated magistrate gives a signal. they cut the ropes, drag wallace over and put his head on the block. the executioner lifts his huge axe and wallace looks toward the crowd. the crowd, wallace's pov he sees hamish, eyes brimming, face glowing... slow motion the axe begins to drop. wallace's pov in the last half moment of his life, when he has already stepped into the world beyond this one, he glimpses someone standing at hamish's shoulder. she is beautiful, smiling, serene. she is marion.}
