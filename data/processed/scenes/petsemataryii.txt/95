<A>__{elliot rudman has the phone tucked under his chin, in the midst of an autopsy. the whirr of the saw drowns out his words as he shaves the dome off a dog's skull.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{i didn't get that...}
<A>__{the pathologist turns off the saw. his words become audible.}
<C>__{rudman}
<D>__{...i said next time it might help if you took the blood sample while the animal was still alive...}
<A>__{the comment hits chase out of left field.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rudman}
<D>__{i don't know what you expected to find, matthews. there's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{wait, there must be some mix up. he was... the dog is alive.}
<C>__{rudman}
<D>__{not this dog. there wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.}
<A>__{chase is baffled, speechless.}
<C>__{rudman}
<D>__{you took over for doctor yolander?}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{yes... why?}
<C>__{rudman}
<D>__{because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was yolander...}
