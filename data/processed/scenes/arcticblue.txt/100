<A>__{viking bob watches, wide eyed with fury. mitchell spits. lemalle punches the wall. then he turns and repeatedly blasts the scout, parked nearby, with his carbine.}

<A>__{eric's knapsack, an emergency kit and several five gallon cans of aviation fuel are tucked behind the seats.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{how the hell were they smart enough to find us?}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{smart? sure. that's why i'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.}
<A>__{eric retracts the landing gear and banks toward the southwest. corbett notices that eric seems a little unsure of the controls.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{been driving long?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so i got one in six weeks.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{that makes the flight more interesting.}
<A>__{eric ignores the jibe. he stays at 2,000 feet, making the landscape all the more immediate. corbett stares out the window and broods. he spots an open, snow covered area where some dark blotches mar the whiteness.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{see the blood? pack of wolves took down a moose. greedy, gut ripping sons of bitches. i'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the president of the u.s. stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{sounds like professional jealousy.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{me and mitchell, bob and lemalle, we were teams. i'd always go with mitchell. good man, mitchell. i'd let bob worry about goddamn lemalle. we'd hire a plane in october. on the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies. we'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before christmas.}
<A>__{another angle (aerial shot) while talking in an even tone, corbett intently studies the instrument panel and scans the landscape below.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{the idea was to get to the supplies before the bears did. along the route we'd set our traps. made our year's living in three months.}
<A>__{corbett spots a flat plateau farther in the mountains, above the tree line.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{lot of times we didn't even have a landing strip. we'd set down on a plateau, like that one there. yeah, that one's easy; you could glide right in...}
<A>__{suddenly, he turns in the seat and pins eric against the door with his left foot. the plane flies erratically. with his right foot, corbett kicks the fuel jettison lever on the instrument panel, jamming it on.}
