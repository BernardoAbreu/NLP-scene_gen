<A>__{this is where the greed murder took place. somerset and mills are taking the constructivist painting off the wall. nothing on the wall behind the painting. blank space.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{this has got to be it.}
<A>__{somerset puts the painting down, resting it on its bottom edge. the frame is backed by a thick sheet of brown paper. he points to where the wire used to be screwed into the frame, and to where it has been re screwed.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{it has to be. he changed the wire to rehang it.}
<A>__{somerset tears along the edge of the brown paper to get to the space between it and the canvas. he tears out the entire sheet. mills helps pull it away, but there's nothing there. empty. mills looks at both sides of the paper, then tosses it away.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{it's nothing.}
<A>__{somerset pays the painting down, face up. he pokes his finger on the painted surface. mills watches as somerset kneels, takes out a credit card and presses it's edge against the canvas, trying to peel up some of the painterior}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{give it up. the killer didn't paint the fucking thing.}
<A>__{somerset pushes the painting away, stands, frustrated.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{he fucked us.}
<A>__{somerset backs away from the wall, staring at the space where the painting hung. there is only a nail. he stares intently, then turns and walks out of the room. mills holds his hands to his temples, furious. somerset can be heard from the other room, going through drawers, dropping things. glass is heard breaking. mills grabs a lamp and throws it on the floor.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{son of a bitch!}
<A>__{somerset comes back in, holding something. he steps over the lamp and goes to the blank wall space.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{bear with me.}
<A>__{mills watches. somerset has a woman's make up compact in hand. he opens it, uses the soft brush to begin applying the red rouge powder to the wall around the nail.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{oh, yeah, sure. you got to be kidding.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{shut up and wait!}
<A>__{somerset brushes with wider strokes. he blows, leans very close to the wall to study the powder. leans closer still. pause.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{call the print lab. now.}
