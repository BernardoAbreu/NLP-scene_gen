<L>__{interior back of pub dog fight night}
<A>__{a circle of blunt faces are exchanging money with one another a few faces turn round to examine tommy and turkish, they frown slightly but carry on about their business once they see they are accompanied by the muscle. the heavy walks over to brick top. the heavy taps him on the shoulder and whispers. he acknowledges, and gives his drink to the heavy. he walks over. there is a cage next to brick top which has a pit bull in, and brick top who is carrying a cane pokes it through the cage doors. the dog snarls back.}
