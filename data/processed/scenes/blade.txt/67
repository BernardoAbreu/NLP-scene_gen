<L>__{interior subway tunnel night}
<A>__{blade and karen stumble out into a larger subway tunnel, which widens into a station stop up ahead. we can see the red tail lights of a train just pulling away from the platform blade and karen re double their efforts, lungs burning, legs pumping like mad. just as the train enters the next tunnel they leap, dragging themselves up onto the back of the rear passenger car. blade smashes his fist through the emergency exit window, then lifts karen up, helping her climb through into the car but the vampires are still coming! crawling along the tunnel walls on all fours, limbs a blur, claws striking the concrete and spewing out sparks. closing fast. too fast.}
<B>__{quinn}
<A>__{springs forward, snagging blade's ankle with his "good" hand. the vampire's weight threatens to haul blade down. blade reaches to his back scabbard, unsheathes his sword thunk! blade brings the sword down on quinn's good arm, cutting it off at the wrist! quinn falls to the tracks, tumbling head over heels back into the darkness the amputated hand, which continues to clutch at blade's ankle, starts to melt. with a cry of disgust, blade kicks the thing away. he turns and climbs through the window }
