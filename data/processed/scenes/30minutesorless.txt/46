<L>__{interior mustang day moving}
<A>__{will navigates the streets. chet is in the back seat, where he has newspaper spread out and is spray painting the air pistols, and much of the car, black.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{be careful, you're getting paint everywhere.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{are you really worried about your upholstery right now?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{yes, because if i survive this shit i'm quitting my job. that means i will probably have to give up my place and i will be sleeping in the back of my car, which you're covering in toxic painterior}
<A>__{chet touches up one of the guns, goes to flip it over.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that side isn't dry yet. you're about to ruin it.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{it says it's fast drying.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{fast isn't the same as instant. you gotta let it sit for like 20 minutes.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{how would you know? you do a lot of graffiti?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no, but i spray painted my bike last year after i got my license suspended. i didn't let it dry properly and i fucked it up.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{we don't have time to sit around and literally watch paint dry. aren't we going straight to the bank?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i was actually thinking we need to stop and steal a car first.}
<A>__{chet drops the spray paint, whirls on will.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{what? no way! we've got a car.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{yeah, my car. i'm not gonna use it as a getaway vehicle. they can trace the plates. even if we do get away, we'll be arrested.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{well, i can't hotwire a fucking automobile, and neither can you.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's why i was thinking we'd steal one from your parents' friends. the fishers. remember how they used to pay us to clean their garage? they leave the keys in there. and they have a datsun. that's a fast car.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i'm not stealing the fishers' datsun. let's steal a car from your parents' friends.}
<A>__{will seethes. he whips the car over to the side of the road and gets in chet's face.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what friends? my parents don't have any. my dad moved away after your big mouth ruined his marriage and humiliated him, and no one wanted to hang out with the mom who everyone knew fucked a lifeguard.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{you never should have told me! i was 13 years old. i couldn't process that kind of information. i had to tell someone else.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{fuck. i really am sorry about it. okay? despite what i said before. i was just a kid, but i messed up.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{chet looks at will, expectantly.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{that's it? you're not gonna apologize for selling my cal ripken ball?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{sure. i'm sorry...i'm sorry that my family was going through a rough patch and i was smoking a ton of weed and listening to the wu tang clan all the time. and that i needed some extra dough to indulge my habit. which, in hindsight, was probably just a cry for help. but you never even noticed.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{thanks. now i feel even worse.}
<A>__{will sits there, stewing for a moment. then he softens }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i shouldn't have stolen the ball. i knew it was wrong and i regretted it like the next day. i actually tried to buy it back but the guy wanted twice as much. i had to smoke even more weed just to get past the whole shitty incident. i guess that's why they call it a downward spiral.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i appreciate that you tried to buy it back. so, thanks.}
<A>__{an awkward moment passes.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{we should probably get going.}
<A>__{will turns back around, goes to pull out without looking and a horn blares as a speeding delivery truck barrels right at them. will slams the brakes, barely avoiding a collision.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{fuck! fuck! i just want this goddamn day to be over!}
<A>__{as chet continues to freak super countdown: 5 hours, 15 minutes...}
