<L>__{int exterior anna's car. highway night}
<A>__{anna peers through the blurred windshield as the wipers battle with the torrential downpour. a large truck plows past menacingly on the rain slicked highway. anna's still upset. she wipes away her tears. on the dashboard the kitschy doll bobs its head from side to side. anna picks up her cell phone. glances down as she dials a number. she looks up... a white van with black tinted windows cuts in front of her.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{anna swerves into the next lane. we hear the blaring horn from the car behind her.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(into rear view mirror)}
<D>__{ok. ok. i saw you.}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{jerk.}
<A>__{the cell phone connects. we hear paul's answering machine.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{paul? you home yet? can you pick up? i just don't want it to end like this.}
<A>__{anna drops the phone into her bag on the passenger seat. wipes away the mist on the inside of the glass. a tractor trailer shudders past loaded with metal pipes.}
<B>__{on metal pipes}
<A>__{the badly loaded pipes bang ominously against each other.}
