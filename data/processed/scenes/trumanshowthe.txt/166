<A>__{before the chopper can take evasive action truman takes aim a second time and fires. the distress flare fishtails into the sky and to truman's surprise and delight, finds its mark, striking the rear rotor blade. truman lets out a whoop. the helicopter immediately begins to spiral downwards towards the sea. the chopper pilots bail out of the cockpit, splashing down safely into the coean while the helicopter enters the waves in a spectacular belly flop, sinking out of view in seconds like a stone. watching the pilots bobbing around in the ocean in their inflatable life jackets, thoughts of duty invade truman's head. he shuts out the thoughts and turns his back, steering away from the drifting pilots. a look of resolve in his eyes we have never witnessed before.}
