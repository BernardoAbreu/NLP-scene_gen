PULL BACK TO REVEAL the airstrip is surrounded by Army Group vehicles and personnel - SD and SS escorts, photographers, aides, Nazi party dignitaries, etc. - all frozen like statues. Eerie. Whatever is going on, it's big. The faint sound of distant airplanes brings tension, subtle but sharp. Approaching the field are three Focke-Wulf 200 Condors escorted by a formation of Messerschmitt-109 fighters. Silence gives way to an escalating roar that seems to have no maximum. One by one, the massive four-engine Condors land while the fighters roar overhead and circle the airfield. The Condors come to rest and, needing no introduction: ADOLF HITLER alights from the lead plane, obscured by the surrounding platoon of heavily armed SS GUARDS. (Note: Hitler is obscured throughout the entire sequence proving how inaccessible he truly was.) Tresckow and his Aide step forward to greet Hitler, but they are pushed back by SS guards. The Fuhrer marches past without so much a glance at his hosts or their waiting limo. To Tresckow's surprise, a second limousine roars onto the airfield from out of nowhere. It is dirty, the windscreen spotted with bugs from a long drive. Hitler gets in the dirty car and speeds off.}
