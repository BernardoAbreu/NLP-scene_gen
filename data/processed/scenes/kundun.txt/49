<A>__{a treasure awaits them. it looks like aladdin's cave full of odd, european items. there are glittering music boxes, a porcelain sink, a gilded mirror, a lacquered rocking horse. there are hats, umbrellas and even a pair of lace up, cordovan shoes. tenzin gyatso lifts a reel of film. there are piles of magazines and books. there is a stack of tires in the back corner. the boys uncover a train set and a good collection of lead soldiers. the dalai lama pockets a gold watch. just as the monks find their young charges and we hear them at the door, tenzin sees something truly spectacular. it is a telescope. the monks enter the room as the young dalai lama reaches for this miracle.}
