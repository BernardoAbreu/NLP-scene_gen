<L>__{exterior ny improv 1975 night}
<A>__{the improv, the biggest comedy club around. people are lined up, waiting. the man strides up george shapiro, a hollywood talent manager. george is old school: bronx accent, shmooze and a hug... but with a surprising sweetness that is quite disarming. a doorman sees him, grins, and waves george in.}
<L>__{interior ny improv, bar 1975 night}
<A>__{the bar is packed with comics and show biz types. a few turn and smile "george!" "hey, george!" george takes a couple hands, whispers to someone else, then drifts into the...}
<L>__{interior ny improv, showroom 1975 night}
<A>__{where the show's in progress. owner budd friedman sees george and gives him a bear hug. then he hustles george to a table. george sits and gives the stage his undivided attention. up there is a wiseass comic.}

<P>__{(the crowd laughs)}
<D>__{thank you. good night!}
<A>__{the comic waves and exits. applause. george politely claps. a piano player jumps in with an upbeat show tune. we think there's a break... when andy suddenly, awkwardly steps on stage. he is in character as foreign man. pink jacket, tie, hair slicked back, frightened like a deer in headlights. he puts down his big case, pulls out various junk, and arranges it on chairs. the room hushes, uncertain as to who the hell this guy is. andy tentatively grabs the mike. the stagefright is agony.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{now? now...?}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{tank you veddy much. i am very happy to be here. i tink this is a very beautiful place. but one ting i do not like is too much traffic. tonight i had to come from, eh, and the freeway, it was so much traffic. it took me an hour and a half to get here!}
<A>__{andy chuckles, as if this were a punchline. silence. the crowd is baffled.}
<D>__{andy (as foreign man) (cont'd) but talking about the terrible things: my wife. take my wife, please take her.}
<A>__{yikes. a few nervous laughs. andy gestures, as if they got the joke.}
<D>__{andy (as foreign man) (cont'd) no really, i am only foolink. i love my wife very much. but she don't know how to cook. you know, one time, she make a steak and mashed potato. ehh, and the night before, she make spaghetti and meatballs. her cooking is so bad... is terrible.}
<A>__{people are embarrassed. some avert their eyes. a couple hipsters laugh mockingly. george leans forward. andy wipes the sweat from his brow.}

<A>__{some people boo and walk out. a few giggle, getting into the groove. george is intrigued.}
<D>__{andy (as foreign man) (cont'd) and now... i would like to imitate the elvis presley.}
<A>__{a woman laughs caustically. andy grins stupidly, then turns his back to us. he presses "play" on a cassette recorder... and the theme from 2001 starts playing. house lights dim dramatically. with a flourish, andy pulls tape off his pants revealing rhinestones. he removes his pink coat putting on a white jeweled jacket. he combs his hair. then he brushes his hair. then he combs his hair some more. finally he picks up a guitar, strikes a pose and spins around. he is elvis. confident. sexy. lip curl. dead on perfect. the crowd is blown away. vegas elvis intro music suddenly blasts. andy elvis swaggers stage left and takes a bow. then he goes stage right and takes a bow. then he returns stage left for another bow. music stops.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{thank you very much.}
<A>__{wow. flabbergasted, people applaud. this man is elvis. suddenly "jailhouse rock" guitar kicks in.}
