<A>__{broussard is moving his light along the rows of heiroglyphs on the wall. they depict stylized drawings of strange monsters. he pauses to quickly change the film clip in his datastick; then he turns back to the "urn" he was examining but now there is a hole in}
<B>__{the top of it.}
<A>__{he shines his light on the floor at the base of the "urn." there lies the "lid" the stopper that had filled the hole. he picks it up and studies it. it appears more organic than artificial; the inside surface is spongy and irregular. then he turns the light to the now open "urn." he bends over the mouth of the "urn" shining the light in, and with shocking violence, a small, octopus like thing leaps out and attaches itself to his face, wrapping its tentacles around his head. with a muffled scream, he launches himself backward, tearing at the thing with his hands.}
