<A>__{crowded with locals. jack orders a coffee. through the window he tries to keep an surreptitious eye on the young man. but the darkness outside throws back reflections of the bright neon lit bar within. one reflection catches our attention. the italian girl. clara. she is drinking and laughing with friends, young italians like her. she catches sight of jack. he turns away.}
<L>__{exterior castel del monte night}
<A>__{jack comes out of the bar with his hand in his pocket. no sign of the young man. he slips down a side street.}
