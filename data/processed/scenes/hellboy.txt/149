<A>__{back in the tunnel, quarry and moss move filing cabinets and rotten bozes full of files. one of them gives out and papers spill all over.}

<C>__{quarry}
<D>__{moss, what the hell was that?}
<A>__{then, two silhouettes cast long shadows. powerful footfalls boom like thunderclaps. agent quarry raises his gun and fires at the dark shapes. useless: the things plow on. moss hurriedly straps on his flame thrower. after a few seconds, a green light beeps, ready. the muzzle of the flamethrower vomits a 30 feet long gout of fire into the blackness. the men pause: silence! quarry turns on his flashlight, hand trembling.}
<C>__{quarry}
<D>__{whatever it was }
<A>__{bam!!! sammael's tongue uncurls from the shadows and lands on quarry's face, pulling him into the dark. his flashlight bobbles and strobes, lighting up a nightmare: two sammaels stand in the tunnel. one of them gleefully squeezes quarry. the man's screams are muffled by the creature's fleshy lips wrapping around his head. moss runs as fast as he can, jumping and tumbling through an obstacle course of beams. turning, he readies the flamethrower. the second sammael lands on moss's back, breaking his spine.}
