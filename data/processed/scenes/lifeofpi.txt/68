<L>__{exterior the ocean, behind the lifeboat the lifeboat day}
<A>__{an hour later. pi finishes tying a knot in a piece of rope that joins oars to the lifebuoy. pull back to reveal that pi has built a makeshift raft, tying three oars into a triangle around the lifebuoy and using the banana net to gather the life vests into a bunch beneath. pi sits back, mopping his brow, then begins pushing and dragging his raft over to the edge of the lifeboat to launch it. the hyena comes out from under the tarp to see what all the noise is. as it paces, it gets too close to o.j., who suddenly comes to life, rising up to her full height, pulling back her lips and roaring. the hair on the hyena's neck and shoulders stands up suddenly, it launches an attack. pi cries out, flinching but o.j. uses one of her long arms to thump the beast on top of the head. pi cheers the blow }
<C>__{pi}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{but the hyena gets up in an instant it attacks again, this time going for o.j.'s throat.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{no!! no!! no!! no!!}
<A>__{o.j. gets pulled down to the floor of the boat, the battle continuing out of view. pi searches through the piles of rope, finding a knife. he rises and dashes forward. pi reaches the end of the tarp. the hyena retreats. o.j. lies in the stern, dead. pi, enraged, confronts the hyena.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{come on! come on!! come on...!!!}
<A>__{pi feels the tarp move under his feet... suddenly, richard parker launches like a blur from under the canvas, going straight after the hyena. pi falls backward on the tarp, stunned. as the tiger clamps his jaws around the hyena, finishing it off, pi leaps back to the bow, shoving his makeshift raft into the water. the raft splashes in the water and the tiger turns; pi looks back and comes face to face with richard parker. the tiger stands with front feet on the crossbench, sniffing the sea air, examining his surroundings for the first time, agitated by this open air environment. as he turns to go back under the tarp, his gaze falls on pi. richard parker's ears swivel, and his lip twitches, revealing a canine as long as a finger. pi, terrified, grabs an oar and holds it out, trying to prevent an attack. unfortunately, he also blocks richard parker's path back under the tarp. the tiger tries to go around the oar, and when pi blocks his way, the tiger swings a paw, knocking the oar into the ocean with such force that pi is spun completely around with his back to the tiger. he falls into a crouch, cowering, prepared to die. richard parker's predator instinct takes over. he snarls and pounces on the tarp, menacingly close to pi then hesitates, unsettled by the softness of the tarp beneath his feet. the tiger retreats, examining his surroundings. pi jumps toward the raft. he belly flops into the ocean and rises in a panic, trying to scramble up onto the raft, only to have it flip completely over his head.}
