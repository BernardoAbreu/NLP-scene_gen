<A>__{eli and his crew are shooting a scene: a "pick up" shot for the explosion sequence we saw earlier. eli and gabe, the cameraman, are lying beside the camera. before them, the "severed" arm protrudes from the sand in which its owner is buried, out of sight.}

<D>__{you sure he can breathe?}
<P>__{(a mumbling assent from beneath the sand)}
<D>__{where's raymond?}
<P>__{(raymond kneels beside him)}
<D>__{remember, you just crashed...you were wandering the beach behind the german lines looking for a place to hide when you saw the explosion. you're stunned by the carnage. that bomb was dropped by a guy in your squadron. okay? roll the film.}
