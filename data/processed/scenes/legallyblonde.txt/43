<L>__{interior law school hallway day}
<A>__{elle heads for a classroom, amidst a crowd of students who eye her like she's an alien. she rounds a corner, seeing — warner, in all his handsome glory, looking over his schedule. she starts toward him, as if pulled by a magnetic force. arrogant aaron sees her passing by.}
<C>__{arrogant aaron}
<P>__{(seductively)}
<D>__{hello there...}
<A>__{elle keeps going, not even noticing him. eyes only for warner. arrogant aaron stomps away, pissed at the perceived blow off. as elle gets closer to warner, she opts for wandering past him, seemingly oblivious to his presence.}

<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{elle?!}
<A>__{elle turns, ultra nonchalant.}
<C>__{elle}

<P>__{(confused at his confusion)}
<D>__{what, like it's that.hard?}
<A>__{warner stares at her completely discombobulated. she smiles sweetly and makes a show of checking her watch.}
