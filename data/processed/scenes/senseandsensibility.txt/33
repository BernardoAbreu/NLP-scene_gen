<L>__{interior norland park elinor's bedroom night}
<A>__{elinor is in bed, deep in thought. marianne enters in her nightclothes, carrying a book of poetry. she reads, teasingly.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{is love a fancy, or a feeling? no it is immortal as immaculate truth 'tis not a blossom shed as soon as youth drops from the stem of life for it will grow in barren regions, where no waters flow nor ray of promise cheats the pensive gloom }
<A>__{she jumps onto the bed. elinor smiles somewhat suspiciously.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{what a pity it is that edward has no passion for reading.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{it was you who asked him to read and then you made him nervous.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{me?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{but your behaviour to him in all other respects is perfectly cordial so i must assume that you like him in spite of his deficiencies.}
<C>__{marianne}
<P>__{(trying hard)}
<D>__{i think him everything that is amiable and worthy.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{praise indeed!}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{but he shall have my unanswering devotion when you tell me he is to be my brother.}
<A>__{elinor is greatly taken aback and does not know how to reply. suddenly marianne hugs her passionately.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{how shall i do without you?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{do without me?}
<A>__{marianne pulls away, her eyes full of tears.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i am sure you will be very happy. but you must promise not to live too far away.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{marianne, there is no question of that is, there is no under standing between...}
<A>__{elinor trails off. marianne looks at her keenly.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{do you love him?}
<A>__{the bold clarity of this question discomforts elinor.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i do not attempt to deny that i think very highly of him that i greatly esteem that i like him.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{esteem him! like him! use those insipid words again and i shall leave the room this instant!}
<A>__{this makes elinor laugh in spite of her discomfort.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{very well. forgive me. believe my feelings to be stronger than i have declared but further than that you must not believe.}
<A>__{marianne is flummoxed but she rallies swiftly and picks up her book again.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{'is love a fancy or a feeling?' or a ferrars?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{go to bed!}
<A>__{elinor blushes in good earnest. marianne goes to the door.}
<C>__{marianne}
<P>__{(imitating elinor)}
<D>__{'i do not attempt to deny that i think highly of him greatly esteem him! like him!'}
<A>__{and she is gone, leaving elinor both agitated and amused.}
