<C>__{mike}

<D>__{count 'em up.}
<A>__{the two of them count and recount as they revisualize each shot in their head. throughout the process they count under their breath and point to different parts of the fairway and green. the two of them revolve, point, and mumble for an absurdly long amount of time until finally...}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{how many strokes?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i don't know. eight or nine.}

<C>__{mike}
<D>__{looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. this is turning into quite a rivalry.}
<A>__{rob points to the far off crowd of a dozen irate golfers waiting to tee off.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you better replace the pin, chi chi. the natives look restless.}
