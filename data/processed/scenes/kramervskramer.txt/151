<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior lawyer's office day}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{a large, very plush office: lots of antiques, beautiful nineteenth century paintings on the wall along with autographed photographs of at least three ex presidents of the united states. sitting behind a large and imposing desk is john shaunessy, a handsome, formidable man in his early sixties. he is well dressed, a cornflower in his buttonhole, that sort of thing. at the moment, shaunessy leans back in his chair as ted finishes his story.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(leaning forward, intense)}
<D>__{look, she walked out on her own child, right? that's desertion, right? mr. shaunessy, i'm telling you it's an open and shut case.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{first, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. especially where custody is involved. got it?}
<A>__{ted nods.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{second, the burden is on us to prove your ex wife is an unfit mother. that means i'm going to have to play rough and, if i play rough, you can bet they will too. can you take that, mr. kramer?}
<A>__{ted nods.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{third, it'll cost you five thousand dollars.}
<B>__{reaction ted}
<A>__{that's an astronomical amount of money to him.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{that's if we win. if we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(determined)}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{good. you've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, mr. kramer.}
<P>__{(down to business)}
<D>__{how old is the child?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{six.}
<B>__{on shaunessy}
<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{that's tough. in most cases involving a child that young, the court tends to side with the mother.}
<B>__{on ted}
<A>__{agitated. this is not what he wanted to hear.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{but she signed over custody. here...}
<A>__{he digs in his pockets, pulls out a piece of paper and thrusts it at the lawyer.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<P>__{(glancing at it)}
<D>__{i'm not saying we don't have a shot, but it won't be easy...}
<P>__{(thinks for a moment)}
<D>__{mr. kramer, do me a favor. there is something i find very helpful in matters like this. i sit down and make a list of all the pros and cons on an issue. i actually write them down and look at them. i want you to do that, okay? then, after that, if you're really sure you want to retain custody of your child then we'll go in there and whip their asses.}
