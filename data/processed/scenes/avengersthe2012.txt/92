<D>__{i wanna know what you’ve done to agent barton.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{i’d say i’ve expanded his mind.}
<C>__{natasha}
<D>__{and once you’ve won. once you’re king of the mountain. what happens to his mind?}
<C>__{loki}

<D>__{before i worked for shield, i uh well, i made a name for myself. i have a very specific skill set. i didn’t care who i used it for, or on. i got on shield’s radar in a bad way. agent barton was sent to kill me, he made a different call.}

<D>__{and what are you now?}
<C>__{natasha}
<D>__{it’s really not that complicated. i got red in my ledger. i’d like to wipe it out.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{can you? can you wipe out that much red? drakov’s daughter? sao paulo? the hospital fire? barton told me everything. your ledger is dripping, it’s gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? this is the basest sentimentality. this is a child, a prayer. pathetic}
