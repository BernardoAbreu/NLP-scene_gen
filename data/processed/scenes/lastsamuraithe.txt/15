<L>__{exterior american embassy . garden days later}
<A>__{in the pristine grounds of the embassy, a garden party is in progress. incongruous lilting yankee tunes are heard from the japanese band. algren and gant, now in their dress uniforms wander through the party with graham. liveried servants pall trays of canapes. elsewhere we see diplomats representing all the powers currently trying to devour japan: russia; england; germany; france; spain; etc.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i remember when it was just america and the dutch. now ever ybody' s getting into the game.}
<A>__{they pass two german diplomats. the germans glance to algren and gant with suspicion, bow tersely. graham greets them in german.}

<D>__{oh, western time quickly loses its meaning here ... i first came as part of the british legation in 1857. but i was soon relieved of m y position, as a result of various...disagreements with the crown's attitude toward the locals.}
