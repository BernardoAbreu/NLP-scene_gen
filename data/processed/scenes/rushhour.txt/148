<L>__{interior north korean consulate surveillance room day}
<A>__{in the converted attic, several north korean espionage agents monitor military and police frequencies, downlinks from remote wiretaps and surveillance units; short wave, cellular, etc. their equipment, being of chinese and iranian manufacture, is hardly cutting edge technology. colonel lee and ambassador han enter. the espionage agents are surprised when carson, miranda, walther and sabatini follow. walther looks around, amazed. carson grabs a pair of headphones.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{south korean consulate's just down the street want to take a listen?}
<A>__{colonel lee pulls the phones away from him. carson takes the page with the fingerprints from sabatini. the espionage agents back away from her and javal's hand.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(continuing; re hand)}
<D>__{shitcan that thing, will you?!}
<A>__{she looks around. then, shrugging, she tosses it into a wastepaper basket.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(continuing; to colonel lee)}
<D>__{got a digital scanner?}
<C>__{colonel lee}

<D>__{dave get in here. bring your computer, a city map, and the tapes of the ransom calls.}
<C>__{dave }
<P>__{(thru radio)}
<D>__{on my way...}
<A>__{he's also heard, faintly, through the laser eavesdropping unit by the window. carson notices, but doesn't comment.}
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(to colonel lee)}
<D>__{colonel, you saw the perp. describe him to the ambassador, see if it's anyone he knows.}
<A>__{colonel lee begrudgingly obliges. carson dials a phone.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{this is carson in l.a. there's a set of prints coming over. narrow the search criteria: male, thirties, caucasian... french, belgian, swiss, maybe canadian. try kidnappers and bombers first. we need an answer in fifteen minutes.}
