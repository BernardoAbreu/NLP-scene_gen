<L>__{interior hospital room 11 pm same evening}
<A>__{whip wakes up in a cold sweat. he is breathing heavy as he scans the room. lightening flashes from outside the window. thunder rumbles. whip looks to the night stand where we see a pack of nicotine gum has been chewed through. whip uses his hands to get to the edge of the bed. he roots through the duffle bag that harling left and finds a pack of smokes and a bic lighter still in its package. determined to smoke, whip eyes a wheel chair that has been placed next to his bed. leaning against the wheelchair is a medical cane.}
