<A>__{the latticed wall of ethergates. the rising beat of footfalls as lincoln approaches. he swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner. the gate slowly hisses open. too slowly for lincoln, who kicks it and barges his way through, leaving the gate to shudder on its hinge.}
<L>__{interior. subway platform}
<A>__{the walkways, unmoving. the platform, deserted. the echoing beat of footfalls as lincoln marches up to the vending machine. he swipes his ethercuff o v e r the scanner. a screen illuminates: sugar quota exceeded; access denied lincoln glowers at the message. his jaw clenching, twitching with anger. erupting, he lashes out, punching t h e machine. he winces as his knuckles crack. then grabs the machine, trying to rip it off the wall. pulling, straining, sneering with effort, until he lets go with a defeated gasp. then kicks the machine in final affront. the machine resounds with a dull boom. for a moment, he stands there, chest heaving. then suddenly traps his breath... the r e , in the fading boom, a noise. faint, rhythmic. becoming discernible as the sound of a man sobbing. lincoln turns toward the platform. tracing the sound, he crosses to the safety fence.}

<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{his voice echoes to nothing. he leans over the fence and peers up the tunnel. there. in the fog of darkness, a figure. a figure paused, half standing, like an animal on the brink of flight. the figure seems to stare at him. then pulls upright. now moving forward and into the light. his face is african american, bull n e c k e d , eyes wild and bloodshot. a stranger to lincoln, we know him as starkweather two delta. his voice is quivering, unhinged }
<C>__{starkweather}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{lincoln stands, frozen by the sight of this dark, dishevelled resident. as he climbs up onto the platform, we see his hands, the fingertips grated and bloody. he lumbers towards lincoln }

<D>__{p l e a s e , you have to help me...}
<A>__{he rushes forward, grabbing lincoln, pulling him face close }
<C>__{starkweather}
<D>__{y o u can't let them take me!}
<A>__{the stranger's eyes grow darkly, his pupils abysmal, black with dilation. lincoln fiercely shrugs off his grip, backing away...}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{w h o are you? what's wrong with you?}
<A>__{the stranger's eyes bore into him, obsidian. face contorting, baring his teeth like a rabid dog. suddenly he lunges a t lincoln boom ramming him back into the vending machine lincoln is stunned suddenly a vice like grip on his wrist swings him round crack into the etherscreen banner, webbing at the impact... for a moment, all is a blur. teetering, lincoln props himself against the wall. then his focus resolves on the etherscreen and his fractured reflection. he releases a deep, bewildered breath. then he notices his wrist. his ethercuff i s missing, his skin, grazed red from abrasion. confusion yielding to anger, he looks for his assailant. but the platform is empty. his jaw clenches.}
