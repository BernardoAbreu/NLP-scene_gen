<L>__{interior fiddler's green boardroom night}
<A>__{kaufman paces with a cigar, passing sutherland, styles, and cliff.}
<C>__{aufman}
<D>__{i recognize that some of you are concerned. we've been threatened by a disgruntled employee. i've sent people out to take care of the problem. however, should something go wrong, i want to assure you that measures have been taken. i've established outposts. with food and supplies to support us on our way.}
<C>__{c}
<C>__{liff}
<D>__{on our way? to where?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{alternate sites have been chosen. air transport has been arranged. for us and our families. as well as necessary support personnel.}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{what about all the others?}
<A>__{kaufman looks at cliff, as if expecting him to understand.}
<C>__{aufman}
<D>__{all the others can be replaced. y others.}
<C>__{liff}
<D>__{but...}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{cliff, let me talk to you for a moment.}
<A>__{kaufman leads cliff into... ...an alcove on the far side of the room, shutting two pocket doors made of sandblasted glass. sutherland and the others can't hear, but can see, kaufman and cliff in silhouette. on the other side of the doors: kaufman leans close to cliff, smiling, his eyes blinking a bit too rapidly.}
<C>__{kaufman }
<D>__{you interrupted me. i was just talking about how people can be replaced. you don't want to be replaced, do you?}
<C>__{cliff}
<P>__{(}
<D>__{nervous) no.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{no, and i don't want to replace you. you have promise. a day may come when you earn yourself some responsibilities. right now, the responsibilities are mine. all the responsibilities. it was my ingenuity that took an old world and made it into something new. i put up fences to make it safe. i hired soldiers and paid for their training. i keep the people on the streets away from us by giving them their games and vices. it costs me money! but i spend it because the responsibility is mine! now do you understand "responsibility"?}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{yes, but...}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{no buts.}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{but...}
<A>__{kaufman looks disappointed. taking cliff by the arm, smiling again, he leads him over to an outer door and opens it. an armed security guard stands in the corridor outside.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{take him out with the rest of the garbage. i won't be needing this man anymore.}
<A>__{at the conference table, sutherland sees the light coming in from the outer corridor, better defining the silhouettes as the security guard drags cliff away.}
<C>__{s}
<C>__{utherland}
<P>__{(to styles) pretty soon it's going}
<D>__{to be one of us.}
