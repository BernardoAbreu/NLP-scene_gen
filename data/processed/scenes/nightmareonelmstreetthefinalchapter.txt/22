<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{he can't hurt you if i'm gone. maybe i will go to the desert or something. i will lie down in the middle of nowhere and finally get some sleep. krueger can feed of the dreams of snakes and vultures.}

<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{maybe i'm crazy.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{running away doesn't help.}
<A>__{he sighs and smiles a bit.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{and you're going to convince me, huh?}

<D>__{i'm going to make some coffee. you promise not to move?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yeah. sure.}
<A>__{karen jumps and heads back into the house. jacob stares at the grass in front of him, his eyes heavy. jacob's pov the lawn a bush sits there doing nothing. until it suddenly comes to life. its leaves start to shrivel, the lawn turns brown, the sky turns dark. everything changes and turns into dream flash nightmare springwood we're in a different front yard in a different town, in a different dimension. the mutant bush starts to change, sprout legs, grow arms, become human.}

<A>__{her body takes shape as she reaches out a pleading arm to us.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{jacob! help me!}

<C>__{alice }
<D>__{no o o o o!}
<A>__{her words are cut off as krueger jams his blades in her gut and we re live her death once more. but it's even worse this time. blood pours from alice like a burst fire hydrant, spraying and showering the entire nightmare lawn like a human sprinkler. freddy laughs.}

<D>__{say it, don't spray it, huh, jacob? come and join the fun!}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{nooooooo!}
