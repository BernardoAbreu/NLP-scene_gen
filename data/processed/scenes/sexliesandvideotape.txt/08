<L>__{interior cynthia bishop's apartment day}
<A>__{john and cynthia are lying in bed, bathed in sweat.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i've got to get back to the office.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i only get one today? gee, how exciting.}
<A>__{john rolls over and begins to put his clothes on.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i can't let my lunch hour go on too long. i've already skipped one meeting.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{don't give me this passive aggressive bullshit. if you want to leave, leave. my life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what i'm saying?}
<A>__{john shakes his head.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{why don't you just tell me how you really feel?}
<A>__{john stands and begins putting on his clothes.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i have a friend coming in from out of town, i will probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{a silent shrug from cynthia. john is almost completely dressed.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i wish you'd quit that bartending job.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i can handle it. besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. and you are in no position to be jealous.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{who said i was jealous?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i did.}
<A>__{john says nothing.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{you know, i'd like to try your house sometime. the idea of doing it in my sister's bed gives me a perverse thrill.}
<A>__{john thinks about that.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i wish i could tell everybody that ann's a lousy lay. beautiful, popular, ann bishop millaney.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{could be risky.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{well, maybe i could just start a rumor, then.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no, i mean doing it at my house.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{afraid of getting caught?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{you should be. can i meet this friend of yours?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{cynthia, i don't think you want to, i mean, you should see the way he dresses. i really think he's in a bad way.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i'm intrigued.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you're intrigued?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{sure. maybe he's the man i'm looking for. then i won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.}
<A>__{john looks at her for a moment before heading for the door.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{bye.}
