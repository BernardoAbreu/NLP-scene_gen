<A>__{the technician nods and exits. defeated, the president slumps sullenly.}
<C>__{general grey}
<D>__{we've moved as many of our forces away from the bases as possible but we've already sustained heavy losses.}
<A>__{the president nods his approval absently. coming out of the bathroom, david overhears.}
<C>__{nimziki}
<D>__{i spoke with the joint chief when they arrived at norad. they agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. hit 'em with everything we've got.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{above american soil?}
<C>__{nimziki}

<D>__{that's impossible...}
<C>__{general grey}
<D>__{my god, the vice president and the joint chiefs...}
<C>__{nimziki}
<D>__{mr. president, we must launch. a delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!}
<A>__{that stings the president. he considers the option. david is shocked.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?}

<D>__{sit down and shut up!}
<A>__{suddenly moishe is on his feet, interrupting.}
<C>__{moishe}
<D>__{don't tell him to shut up! you'd all be dead, were it not for my david. you didn't do anything to prevent this!}

<A>__{for the first time in along time, president whitmore smiles.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{regardless of what the tabloids have said, there were never any space crafts recovered by the government. take my word for it, there is no area 51 and no recovered space ship.}
<A>__{chief of staff nimziki suddenly clears his throat.}
<C>__{nimziki}
<D>__{uh, excuse me, mr. president, but that's not entirely accurate.}
