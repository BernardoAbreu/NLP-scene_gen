<L>__{interior the tabernacle}
<A>__{the light in here is lovely, unearthly. oil lamps burn. the tabernacle is really several concentric, silk tents, which creates a flowing maze effect. the innermost tent has at its center a 3 foot high, tapestry covered altar. belloq watches with gleaming, obsessed eyes as two nazis carefully lift the actual ark out of its crate by means of the long poles. the ark dazzles the eye, seeming to glow gold in this strange light. the two nazis place it carefully on the altar. shliemann and some aides hang back. marion is nowhere to be seen.}
