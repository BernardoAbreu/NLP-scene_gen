<L>__{interior pearl's parlor night}
<A>__{pearl sits alone, drinking. maybe crying a little. her hands shuffle large tarot cards. she lays her own spread. first card face down. second card face up.}
<B>__{the lovers.}
<A>__{and across it the third is laid: the crumbling tower. then she slips the first card, the down turned card out and flips it face up. death. suddenly a long black shadow falls over the table.}
<C>__{pearl}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{welcome back, lover.}
<A>__{she finally looks up at him.}
<C>__{pearl }
<D>__{not so bad. you're not quite him. but you're not the shaggy demon i expected, neither.}
<A>__{his face quivers and we see from his pov: pearl then and now. again, then and now.}
<C>__{pearl }
<D>__{you look confused. the dead often are. 'course, so are the living. take me. i been confused a long time. least twenty years. maybe if i hadn'ta walked in at that moment. or maybe if i hadn'ta let you go at all. i figure one way or the other, i killed you. so it's only fair: kill me, lover. i don't mind. i will even help you. the way you helped me.}
<A>__{she grabs his hand, tries to stab herself with his razor. but he resists. pulls his arm free.}
<C>__{pearl }
<D>__{no? that mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? what are you going to do now? kill us? kill us all?}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{no. not...not you. you i forgive.}
<A>__{she hurls herself at him. slapping him. slamming her fists against his shadowy chest.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{forgive me? the hell with you, jimmy. cause i don't forgive you, i don't forgive you for dying. and for being so goddamn stubborn. or for haunting my dreams. and i don't forgive you for anything you're about to do.}
<A>__{he looks down at her. his face wavering between the true face of jimmy bones and the angry bones ready to kill her. then he wraps his arms around her and they kiss. she faints, the cards in her fist fluttering to the floor. he lays her gently down. when suddenly cinnabar throws the door open. she and bones make eye contact. she sets eyes for the first time on the father she's never known. and in the blink of her eye, he's gone. she runs to where her mom lies on the floor.}
