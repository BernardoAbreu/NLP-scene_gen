<A>__{preceded by a police car, ecto 2 enters the small park on the east river at 88th street and disappears into an underground entrance. the camera pans up to reveal gracie mansion, the residence of the mayor of new york city.}
<L>__{interior gracie mansion moments later}
<A>__{the ghostbusters, now wearing police raincoats over their longjohns are ushered through the house by a butler to a set of double oak doors. the butler knocks lightly, then opens the door to reveal the mayor sitting in front of the fireplace in his well appointed private study, flanked by jack hardemeyer, both in tuxedoes. the ghostbusters enter.}
<L>__{interior study continuous action}
<A>__{the mayor is impatient and a little angry at having been pulled out of his formal reception. he frowns at their bizarre attire.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{all right the ghostbusters. i will tell you right now; i've got two hundred of the heaviest campaign contributors in the city out there eating bad roast chicken waiting for me to give the speech of my life. you've got two minutes. make it good.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{you get enough negative energy flowing in a dense environment like manhattan, it starts to build up, and if we don't do something fast this whole place will blow like a frog on a hotplate.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{tell him about the toaster.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{i don't think he's ready for the toaster.}
<C>__{mayor}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{being miserable and treating other people like dirt is every new yorker's god given right. what am i supposed to do go on television and tell eight million people they have to be nice to each other? i'm sorry, none of this makes any sense to me, and if anything does happen we've got plenty of paid professionals to deal with it. your two minutes are up. good night, gentlemen.}
<A>__{the mayor exits, leaving the ghostbusters to hardemeyer.}
<C>__{hardemeyer}
<P>__{(smirking)}
<D>__{that's quite a story.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{yeah, i think the times might be interested, don't you? the post might have a lot of fun with it, too.}
<A>__{hardemeyer's eyes go cold and calculating.}
<C>__{hardemeyer}
<D>__{before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{now you're talking.}
