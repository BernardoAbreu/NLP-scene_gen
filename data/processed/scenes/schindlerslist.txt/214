<L>__{interior brinnlitz factory day}
<A>__{schindler strolls through his factory looking over the shoulders of the workers, nodding his approval. the place is in full operation, finally; the people, having figured out the complicated hilos, turning out shells by the caseload. schindler pauses at one of the machines.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{how's it going?}
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{good. it's taken a while to calibrate the machines, but it's going good now.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{schindler nods. then frowns. he leans down and taps at the crystal of one of the gauges.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{this isn't right, is it?}
<A>__{the worker kneels down, takes a look. it looks right to him. reaching over, schindler changes the calibration of the machine with a cavalier adjustment to a knob and all the gauge readings shift.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{there. that looks right.}
<A>__{he wanders off. the worker stares after him. he's just screwed up settings that took weeks to get right. schindler comes up to another worker, levartov, the hingemaker. he's at a machine buffing shells.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{how's it going, rabbi?}
<C>__{levartov}
<D>__{good, sir.}
<A>__{schindler nods, watches him work, eventually glances away.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{sun's going down.}
<A>__{levartov, following schindler's gaze, nods uncertainly.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{it is friday, isn't it?}
<C>__{levartov}
<D>__{is it?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you should be preparing for the sabbath, shouldn't you? what are you doing here?}
<A>__{levartov just stares. it's been years since he's been allowed, indeed inclined, to perform sabbath rites.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i've got some wine in my office. why don't we go over there, i will give it to you. come on, let's go.}
<A>__{schindler heads off. the rabbi keeps staring. schindler gestures back to him, offering casually }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{levartov looks around. finally, he hangs up his goggles and follows after schindler.}
