<A>__{we're in the bathroom of the hollywood apartment we were in earlier. in fact, we're there at exactly the same time. except this time, we're in the bathroom with the fourth man. the fourth man is pacing around the small room, listening hard to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly clutching his huge silver .357 magnum.}

<A>__{bang! bang! boom! pow! bam bam bam bam bam! the fourth man freaks out. he throws himself against the back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough to stick their head through that door. then he listens to them talk.}
