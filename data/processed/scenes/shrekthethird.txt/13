<C>__{fiona}

<A>__{shrek and fiddlesworth finally see the crowd. they both freeze. shrek laughs nervously. suddenly shrek's belt buckle snaps off and hits donkey in the eye. he stumbles through the crowd screaming.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{ow!! my eye! my eye! shrek the third final screening script 11.}
<A>__{as he is stumbling, he grabs hold of a lady in the crowd.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{the woman pushes donkey away. he falls, knocking over a guard holding an axe on his way down. the guard drops the axe. it flies past puss, who is in the arms of a lady. the axe knocks over a vase. the vase flies up on stage and fiona maneuvers to catch it. in flight, water spills out of the vase which causes fiona to fall over. shrek's tuxedo bib slaps him in the face. the clasp holding shrek's pants up breaks off. shrek stands on stage with his pants around his ankles. he shuffles towards fiona.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{fiona!}
<A>__{he trips over his pants and hits a loose wooden plank on the stage. the plank flings up and sends fiddlesworth flying through the air where his jacket slips over a banner pole, trapping him.}

<D>__{uhhh...}
<P>__{(wimper)}
<A>__{shrek has reached fiona who is still lying on the floor.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{yeah. i'm fine.}
<A>__{fiona's eyes suddenly widen. fiddlesworth's jacket rips and he falls onto a waiter carrying flaming skewers.}
<C>__{fiddlesworth}
<D>__{ahhhh!}
<A>__{the skewers fly through the air. donkey stands up in frame with one eye half shut. the flaming skewers shoot by him and land in the curtains, setting them on fire. he blows one of the skewers out and takes a bite.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{oh! shrimp! my favorite. shrek the third final screening script 12.}
<A>__{the fire causes a far far away shield to detach from a wooden ceiling beam and fall onto the stage, breaking it in half. the whole stage collapses in the middle. the buffet tables slide toward shrek and fiona at the other end and collide. crash! bang!}
