<L>__{interior henry's apartment night}
<A>__{henry's turn to host the group meeting. alan, william, colette, and john share the lumpy couch and the folding metal chairs. open pizza starz boxes in the background. everyone is enjoying a single slice of pizza off a paper plate except for john, who is inhaling two pieces at once. the mood is somber. quiet.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{hannah's just lucky. that's all.}
<A>__{john tries to agree, but his mouth is too stuffed with pizza. cheap flowers from ralph's and balloons in full display on the coffee table. henry stands listening by the front door.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{here she comes!}
<A>__{henry opens the door. hannah floats in. the serious expressions suddenly, magically, turn to broad smiles. henry is the first to offer a hug. alan, william, colette, john give her a standing ovation. hannah notices the balloons and flowers.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{ohhhhhh. for me? you shouldn't have.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{way to go, ms. published author!}
<A>__{everyone gets a hug from hannah. william gives hannah an extra long hug.}
