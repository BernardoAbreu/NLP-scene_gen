<A>__{roger is trying to manage the building chaos backstage as the fire marshal and several firemen follow after him.}
<C>__{fire marshal}
<D>__{you don't have a permit for any of these stunts!}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{i told you i don't know anything about it!}
<A>__{a walkie talkie distracts the fire marshal long enough to allow roger to run.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{last time i work for a bloody vampire...}
<A>__{looking up at the sky, he stares in awe... there is a low powerful rumble... the mortal crowd looks around, distracted from their panic, as they sense something truly awesome...}
<B>__{lestat}
<A>__{senses it too. he looks up, not knowing from which direction the attack will come. the stage starts to shudder and shake violently... jesse, now almost to the stage, screams to him.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{lestat! lestat!}
<A>__{suddenly the wooden platform beneath lestat begins to buckle under his feet. fragments of wood explode upwards around lestat. marius loses his balance and staggers backwards... fragments of sharp wood fly into the audience. jesse raises her hands to protect herself. she looks up. freezes. akasha rises up through the stage. beautiful and terrifying. she grabs lestat and the two of them shoot up into the air. the crowd stares in awe. jesse is frozen. roger, the fire marshal, the band, everyone is frozen. talbot stares up at akasha, his face white, unable to believe his eyes. even the ancient ones are stunned to see their queen come to life. scaffolds collapse in an explosion of electrical sparks... (note: practical explosion.) the ancient ones stare up into the sky as... akasha and lestat vanish. jesse stares in horror after them.}
