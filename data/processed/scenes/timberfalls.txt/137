<D>__{no!}
<A>__{ida drops by his side, cradles his body. the love of her life is gone. before she know what's happening, she turns... mike, knife in hand, explodes from torture room #2, runs straight for ida, but... ida swings the shovel, knocks mike's legs out from under him. he trips and falls to the floor. ida gets up, stomps down on mike's hand. the knife drops. from the hallway... sheryl looks out, watches as... back in the room... ida grabs the knife, plunges it deep into mike's calf.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{in for a penny, in for a pound. i can't save your soul now, michael. i tried. i gave you a way to cleanse yourself of all your sins and deliver you to heaven... and how do you repay me?}
<A>__{ida takes the knife, daggers it into mike's thigh.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{by killing my clyde?!?}
<A>__{sheryl spots the shovel on the floor, grabs it...}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{there is no soul blacker than yours. and now, by the grace of god, i must deliver you to satan myself.}
<A>__{ida retracts the blade, pulls herself on top of mike. ready to stab again, when... sheryl slams the shovel over ida's head. angle on the shovel blade sprayed with blood. ida falls over. sheryl and mike stare at her lifeless body. sheryl steps over ida's legs. she takes a big step, clears ida's upper body...and stumbles. sheryl goes to mike, wraps his arm around her, lifts him up. but just as his foot touches the ground... a surge of pain cripples him. mike falls back to the ground.}
