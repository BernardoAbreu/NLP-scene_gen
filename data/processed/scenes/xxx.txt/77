<L>__{interior romantic restaurant day}
<A>__{this is a beautiful and historic prague location with windows and a nice view. it's rather fancy and packed with upscale patrons. petra and xander sit in the middle of the room, sticking out badly in their grungy clothes. a waiter takes their order.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{perogies, potato pancakes, fried goose livers, the sausage plate and a pot of turkish coffee.}
<A>__{xander shakes his head.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i'm just gonna have a garden salad. oil and balsamic vinegar on the side.}
<A>__{the waiter takes off. petra puffs on a cigarette, staring at xander.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{that's how you eat? it's like a gerbil.}
<C>__{xander}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i'm from l.a.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{so why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. they obviously have very deep pockets. are you from a rival clan?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{let's just say i'm freelancing and leave it at that.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{whoever sent you knew what they were doing. you and yorgi are practically twins. two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{don't judge a comic book by it's cover.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{you agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i know where he's coming from. the only thing i really don't get is why he dumped you. up until i found that out, i thought his judgment was pretty sound.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{don't even start. i will be honest, i don't trust you. bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that i want to leave. what can you do about it?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{the people i know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. they're interested in putting anarchy 99 out of business.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{all i have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{we could work together. then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. there's a beach in bora bora with my name on it.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{a beach named x? that i'd like to see.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{so there you have it. i guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?}
<A>__{she thinks on it. then her cell phone rings.}
<C>__{petra}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{da!}
<C>__{kirill }
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{listen very carefully, petra. we think cage may be an american agent, do you understand what i'm telling you?}
<C>__{petra}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kirill }
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{don't worry, i've got your back. i'm right across the street, above the bakery. just bring him outside and let me do the rest.}
<A>__{kirill hangs up. she looks back at xander, shell shocked.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what's up? is there a problem?}
<A>__{she studies his eyes, decides to risk it.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{they tell me you're an american agent.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{there's no more time for games. they made you. there's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. tell me if it's true.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{it's a long story, but yeah, more or less.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{jesus christ. you're going to have to go out the back. the data that you copied with your toy. tomorrow, at six o'clock. look it up. we're taking a trip. be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{if i go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{that's alright, i will figure something out.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{not an option. just get up slowly like everything's cool. petra, trust me. you just hung yourself out to dry for me, i'm not gonna let you down.}
