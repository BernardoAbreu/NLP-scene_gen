<L>__{interior old barn night}
<A>__{bill and wally move cautiously but quickly inside. but they stop suddenly, in disgust and horror.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{oh...}
<A>__{it's brenda. and she doesn't look good. her weepy little head is stuck to the front of a huge fleshy orb, which is what her body has become. this enormous ball of flesh is nine or ten feet tall. vestigial fingers protrude from the sides. she is utterly immobile. her flesh sloshes, slightly and constantly; a thousand snakes seem to be slithering beneath her thin, tight, bruised skin. the woman is in great pain. she sobs. her mouth and chin are stained with blood. the posse and starla enter behind bill and wally and are equally astounded.}
<C>__{older cop}
<D>__{oh, shit!}
<A>__{they see the source of the awful stench: brenda is encircled by the rotting carcasses of cows and horses and forest critters. they are mostly skeletal, as they have been largely devoured. they're swarming with flies. the stench is so bad the posse cover their faces with the bottom of their shirts. the sobbing brenda looks desperately at bill and wally.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{something's wrong with me.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{uh, yeah.}
<A>__{bill and wally get in a little closer.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{brenda, um...}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{i didn't want no one to be seeing me like this.}
<A>__{as the posse inch closer, brenda's whole body suddenly lurches forward a bit like whatever's inside her is trying to get out and to the posse. brenda screams in agony. the posse jump back. they stare as she recomposes herself.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{how are my boys, bill? are they all right?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{boys are fine, brenda. uh, what's what's happening here, exactly?}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{i'm so fucking hungry, bill. i'm so hungry. i just never knew anybody could be so hungry.}
<A>__{brenda tries to smile in a way she might charm her daddy into giving her candy. this is creepy as hell.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{would you mind handing me a piece of that possum there at your feet? little bit?}
<A>__{trevor gags and runs out of the barn.}
