<L>__{1940}
<A>__{we float through the elegant crowd and spy louis b. mayer and louella; clark gable and carole lombard; all manner of movie stars and power brokers. we also spy schaefer sitting with mank and toland and a few other men and women. the evening's emcee takes the stage}
<C>__{emcee}
<D>__{next up we have a real treat. it's orson welles. now, during the rehearsal for the benefit tonight orson banished everyone from the club so he could proceed in utmost secrecy. but you all know how orson is!}
<A>__{laughter from the crowd}
<C>__{emcee}
<D>__{so, lets give a big round of applause for mr. orson welles and miss rita hayworth.}
<A>__{polite applause as welles bounds to the stage with rita hayworth and the band begins to play a buoyant tune. schaefer practically drops his fork welles is dressed in a padded costume and made up in a way that can suggest no one but william randolph hearst. rita hayworth is dressed in a manner mightily like marion davies. louella glances to mayer, daggers. some knowing laughter from the audience. particularly mank a line of chorus girls hoof on and join welles and rita hayworth as a row of harsh footlights snap on, giving the scene a resemblance to the "charlie kane" dance in citizen kane. and welles launches into a jaunty song and dance version of "disgustingly rich" an almost unknown rodgers and hart song;'. welles has wickedly changed some of the lines.
