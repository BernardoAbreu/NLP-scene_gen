<L>__{interior mall night}
<A>__{all the lights are off and we see the dark shadow creep through the darkness. the shadow breaks into the shoe store and grabs as many pairs of sneakers that it can carry. the shadow opens the sliding cage and closes it from the other side. then bends down and locks it.}
<L>__{interior mall manager's office the next day}
<A>__{mark sits behind his desk reading a paper. the headline reads: chaos climbs at carolina mall. there's a knock at the door.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{ronnie sticks his head in the door.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{good morning, mark.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{is it, ronnie? i mean, the mall is getting butchered in the press. somebody who works here is ripping the place off. the cops don't have any leads. i'm getting shit from the owner of the mall. sales are down. i mean, what's so good about this morning?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i feel your pain, mark. quite frankly, there's two things happening. one, i'm lacking a sufficient firearm. and two, we're understaffed. that's why i come to you this morning with a plan.}
<P>__{(calling to the door)}
<D>__{come on in, charles.}
<A>__{charles opens the door and walks in.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{who is this?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{this is charles, sir.}
<C>__{charles}
<P>__{(bouncer)}
<D>__{how's it going?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you work at o'charley's, right.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{mark, i would like to hire charles here as an additional security guard. he would operate under me. i figure with the additional criminal element, we should hire more security in hopes that we would have a better chance of catching these guys.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{do you have any experience, son?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{not really.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{um, sir, i have personally been training young charles for weeks now in preparation for this day. the kid kind of looks up to me. i'm some what of a big brother to the little guy.}
<A>__{charles kind of looks at ronnie like he's crazy.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{alright, it's actually not a bad idea. it might make our security more visible so we can give people the illusion that we're on top of this.}
<A>__{ronnie winks at charles.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{thank you, mark.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{ronnie, one more thing. look, if this crime doesn't come to an end pretty soon, we're gonna have to let someone go. i mean, you've always done a great job for me, but the truth is, someone is going to have to take the fall. you're the one who wanted to be head of mall security and quite frankly, i just bought my wife a new cadillac, so let's just say it won't be me.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{with charles on my team, i can now devote more time to the robbery and pervert case. i plan on having these wrapped up by the end of the week.}
<A>__{mark laughs to himself.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{why'd you just laugh?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it's nothing. have fun, ronnie.}
<A>__{ronnie looks at charles.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{did i say something funny?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{let's go, ronnie.}
<A>__{ronnie and charles take off.}
