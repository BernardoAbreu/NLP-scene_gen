<L>__{interior oval office night}
<A>__{grimacing in pain. he opens a pill bottle, takes two pills out. he takes a whiskey in a shot glass from kenny.}
<B>__{resume}
<A>__{kenny finishes pouring him and bobby a couple of more shots, discreetly turning a blind eye to the president's pain. the president returns from his desk, shirt untucked, disheveled, back stiff. he eases into his rocking chair. bobby lies sprawled on the couch. kenny sits down. they all look at each other. a beat, something like shock.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{jesus christ almighty...}
<A>__{they burst out laughing. an absurd, tension draining moment. they shoot their drinks, kenny refills.}
<C>__{kenny }
<D>__{call me irish, but i don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{acheson's scenario is unacceptable. and he has more experience than anyone.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{there is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.}
<A>__{the president stares kenny in the face, understanding.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{the thing is, acheson's right. talk alone won't accomplish anything.}
<A>__{kenny considers the president, his face straight as he says:}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{then let's bomb the shit out of them. everyone wants to, even you, even me.}
<P>__{(there's a point)}
<D>__{it sure would feel good.}
<A>__{the president sees what kenny's saying: it'd be an emotional response, not necessarily the intelligent one.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{jack, i'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{he's right. and things are happening too fast. it smells like the bay of pigs all over again.}
<A>__{bobby picks up some reconnaissance photos on the coffee table.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{as if dealing with the russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{tonight, listening to taylor and acheson, i kept seeing burke and dulles telling me all i had to do was sign on the dotted line. the invasion would succeed. castro would be gone. just like that. easy.}
<A>__{the president is rendered mute by a wave of pain. kenny and bobby aver their eyes. when it passes, the president is hushed, grave.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{there's something...immoral about abandoning your own judgement.}
<A>__{kenny nods, moved. the president reaches out for the reconnaissance photos bobby's flipping through. bobby hands them to him. the president looks them over. and when he speaks, there's humility. and resolve.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{we can't let things get ahead of themselves. we've got to control what happens. we're going to do what we have to make this come out right. excom is our first weapon.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we'll resort to others as we need 'em.}
