<L>__{interior rec room}
<A>__{the tractor blazes into the rec room. macready parks it directly in front of the hole in the roof, created by the thing when it surprised them earlier.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{damn it, ran out of gas.}
<A>__{he pulls off the heavy hydrogen tanks and drapes them over the tractor. as he talks his eyes move like a hawk passing from roof, to doorways, to rubble. wind and ice bristle through the gaping holes, stinging macready with the cold. he winces at his mittenless, blackened fingers.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{sweetheart, it's going to get mighty cold in here soon... you better make your move... i mean, hell, i'm only one person...}
<A>__{he takes a swig from his bottle.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{i know you're bugged because we ruined your trip, right? spiffy little toy you had there.}
<A>__{a slight tremor perks his eyes and ears. he looks up through the hole, then around. he lights a lighter and cups it in his hand near the stick of dynamite in his lap.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{but your real hang up is your looks...}
<A>__{a stronger tremor. the adrenalin pumps.}
<C>__{macready}
<P>__{(wants him bad)}
<D>__{atta boy. i know you're around.}
<A>__{the floor shakes. macready stands, his head whirling around the room.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{come on, sucker.}
<A>__{the tractor inches up off the ground. macready falls forward and looks straight down through the chassis and into the vile and grinning face below. a claw flashes up, splitting the steering wheel but missing his face. he depresses the ignition, bolting the tractor ten feet. he jumps, hanging onto the edge of the hole in the ceiling. the thing's face and arms burst through the metal plating of the tractor. the reaching claws just miss him as he pulls himself through.}
