<A>__{reverse angle: the baseball diamond is sitting in the vast, lush grounds behind the panda modem world headquarters, a brand new, distinctively original, high tech office park. wherever there is an opportunity for tasteful signage, it is in the motif of a giant panda sweet white face, black eyes and ears, round body. skip is suddenly self conscious, embarrassed.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i would've traded any of it to have made the mumford high varsity.}
<A>__{mumford takes that in. slap... slap.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{so i guess henry follett is a patient of yours. he's my pharmacist.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(slap... slap)}
<D>__{guy's got some serious sex fantasies.}
<A>__{skip is a little surprised to hear this from mumford, but he just throws the ball.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{pretty good, too. lots of detail. nothing hard core. old fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. nothing can live up to it. his wife got sick of it and left him. took his kids with her.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i wondered what happened to her...}
<A>__{skip is fascinated, but a little uncomfortable. mumford seems oblivious, unusually talkative }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{of course, it's not that simple. there's something powerful going on there. we've got a lot of work to do.}
<P>__{(announcer voice)}
<D>__{it's hit to the warning track!}
<A>__{for the first time, mumford throws the ball way high, like a long fly ball. skip, delighted as a dog, takes off running and just barely catches it on the run. he pegs it back to mumford.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{in these fantasies, henry follett is played by a handsome guy with biceps. can you imagine that? where your self esteem has to be?}
<P>__{(throws him the ball)}
<D>__{man, i'd just like to move the guy to the point where he gets to appear in his own fantasies.}
