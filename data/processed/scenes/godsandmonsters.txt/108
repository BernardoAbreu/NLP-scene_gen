<L>__{interior whale's house living room night}
<A>__{whale removes the lid, sets the hatbox on the sofa.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i would like you to wear this?}
<A>__{whale steps back. clay takes the box and covers his lap with it. he lifts out the gas mask.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{for the artistic effect. the combination of your human body and that inhuman mask. it's quite striking.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{please, clayton. just for a minute. long enough for me to see the effect.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it's from the first world war, isn't it?}
<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{there are straps in back.}
<A>__{clay fits the mask on the top of his head and draws it down. the living room turns brownish yellow in the thick glass goggles.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{let me help you.}
<A>__{whale is suddenly behind him. clay's vision is enclosed in two round windows, so he can't see whale buckling the second strap.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{now what?}
<A>__{mouth muffled by the inhalator, clay hears his voice from inside his head. whale comes around to stand in front of him. he grins as he steps back to examine clay. clay nervously taps his knees with his hands.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{all right. let's take it off now.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it's too tight.}
<A>__{clay raises his voice to make himself heard. he reaches back to undo the buckles.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{allow me.}
<A>__{whale steps in past the goggles.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{we don't want to tear the straps.}
<A>__{clay drops his hands so whale can undo the buckles. but nothing happens. clay turns left and right.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh yes. i am still here.}
<A>__{two hands grip clay's shoulders.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what steely muscles, clayton.}
<A>__{whale's hands squeeze. clay grabs the frame of his seat, to stop his arms from automatically swinging a fist. whale's hand slides over clay's shoulder to his arm, caressing the tattoo. clay jerks his shoulder to shake whale off.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{just take off the fucking mask!}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{relax, clayton. i can't hear you. i can't hear a word.}
<A>__{whale presses his lips to clay's tattoo. clay's muscles tense from head to toe.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what a solid brute you are.}
<A>__{whale's tongue moves down clay's arm.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{no? maybe this, then?}
<A>__{the hand slides over clay's stomach toward his lap. the tattooed arm swings backward, slamming an elbow against whale's skull. clay jumps from the chair, knocking into an end table. the glass and crystal decanter fall to the floor. the lamp spills over and the room goes dark. clay's ankle is caught by the sofa leg and he hits the floor, jamming the inhalator against his mouth. he quickly gets up, on his knees and elbows, pulling at the mask. flashes of lightning strobe the room as whale collapses over clay's back and holds on.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh yes. i have you now.}
<A>__{a strap breaks. clay rips the mask off.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{get the fuck off!}
<A>__{whale's hand squeezes between clay's legs.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what will you do to get yourself back?}
<A>__{clay jabs with his elbow, flipping whale on his back. his body straddles whale's and pins him, face to face.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm not that way. get it through your fucking head. i don't want to mess with you.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh, but you feel good, clayton.}
<A>__{his hands clasp clay's hips. clay's fist opens as it comes down; he slaps whale across the face.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{that didn't even sting. you're not such a real man after all. are you?}
<A>__{clay whacks whale's face again.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{wait until i tell my friends i had you naked in my arms. won't they be surprised?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i haven't done a damn thing with you!}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh, but you have. you undressed for me. i kissed you. i even touched your prick. how will you be able to live with yourself?}
<A>__{clay snatches whale's wrist before it can touch his crotch. with his other hand he picks up the heavy crystal decanter.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what the hell do you want from me?!}
<A>__{whale tilts his face up for another blow.}
<D>__{whale i want you to kill me .}
<A>__{clay freezes. he stares down at the old man with white hair and wild eyes lying beneath him.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{break my neck. or strangle me. it would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me. please, clayton. we've come this far.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you're crazy.}
<A>__{whale's eyes glimmer in the sporadic bursts of lightning.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{exactly, i'm losing my mind. every day, another piece goes. soon there will be nothing left. look at the sketch i made of you.}
<A>__{clay turns to the sketch pad, which lies on the floor next to whale. the page is filled with nothing but doodles and scrawls.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{look, if you want to die do it yourself!}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{no, i don't want to die alone. but to be killed by you that would make death bearable. they say you never see the one with your name on it. but i want to see death coming at me. i want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face. your face. think, clayton. you'd be my second monster. almost as famous as the first. it would be the great adventure you've yearned for. a war story for both of us to share.}
<A>__{clay's breathing comes in quick, panicked bursts.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you'd be fully exonerated, i've taken care of that. i wrote a note, i will even leave you the house, the car...}
<A>__{clay's body starts to tremble.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{do it now, clayton. make me invisible.}
<A>__{clay lets out a howl his shoulders heave and shake.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i am not your monster.}
<A>__{he climbs off whale, crawls away, his body collapsing in wracking, anguished sobs. whale opens his eyes, gazes at clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what have i done?}
<P>__{(sits up)}
<D>__{oh, selfish, selfish fool. i have lost my mind.}
<A>__{he forces himself to his feet.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what was i thinking?}
<A>__{whale picks up the towel and moves over to clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you're a softhearted bloke. a bloody pussycat.}
<A>__{whale places the towel around clay's shoulders.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{my deepest apologies. can you ever forgive me?}
<A>__{clay doesn't look up.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i suppose not.}
<P>__{(a bone crushing sigh)}
<D>__{good god, i am tired. i really must go to bed.}
<A>__{whale starts slowly down the hall.}
