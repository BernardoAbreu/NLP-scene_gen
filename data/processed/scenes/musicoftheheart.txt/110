<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{is it true?}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{why don't you come in my office?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{it's true? you're firing me?}
<C>__{janet}

<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(reeling)}
<D>__{i just... i can't even believe this is happening!}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{why not? you're a sub. your position has never been permanent.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{shut up, dennis! you're not helping!}
<P>__{(softly, to roberta)}
<D>__{come into my office, please.}
