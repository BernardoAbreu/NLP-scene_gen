<D>__{you kill your film several times, mostly by talking about it. a film is a dream. you kill it writing it down, you kill it with a camera; the film might come to life for a moment or two when your actors breathe life back into it but then it dies again, buried in film cans. mysteriously, sometimes, in the editing room, a miracle happens when you place one image next to another so that when, finally, an audience sits in the dark, if you're lucky very lucky and sometimes i've been lucky the dream flickers back to life again. that's why i'm secretive.}
