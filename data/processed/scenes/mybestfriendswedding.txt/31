<A>__{cutting edge salon. loud, pulsing music. digger and michael in adjacent chairs, heads back, each smoking impressive cigars as their hair is styled. digger's stylist is a hot trashy female. michael's is a tall, flamboyant male in a day glo vest. each man has one hand soaking, the other being worked on by a manicurist, so julianne goes from one to the other, removing their cigars so they can exhale. a seraglio feel to the way she does this. now she's arguing with michael's stork like stylist. we can't hear over the music, but she keeps tugging on michael's hair, pretty passionate about her point of view. suddenly, she grabs the scissors to do it herself, and michael... ... bolts out of the chair. whoa!}
