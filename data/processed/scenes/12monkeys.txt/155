<A>__{a lobby poster boasts "classics 24 hours a day" and "hitchcock festival". panning off the poster, passing a snoring usher, dead to the world in an old velvet chair, we discover a brunette in a tight dress, just hanging up the lobby pay phone. turning, she reveals heavy make up, gaudy costume jewelry, and sun glasses. she's the brunette in cole's dream! crossing the lobby toward the auditorium, it's a pleasure to watch her nice body undulate in the tight dress. just then, the auditorium doors burst open and a blonde man in a hawaiian shirt appears, the man from cole's dream, except this man's moustache is fixed firmly on his upper lip. the blonde man stops, stunned at the sight of the brunette.}
