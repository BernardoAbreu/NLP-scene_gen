<L>__{interior alex's apartment night}
<A>__{a party is in full swing. typical affair for someone in their late 20's mediocre food but decent alcohol. gigi stands, somewhat uncomfortably, near the chex mix. she tries smiling at a tall girl, who ignores her. so gigi continues absently and compulsively shoving handfuls of chex mix into her mouth.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{it makes your breath stink.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{pardon?}
<A>__{gigi looks up to see nathan and bruce mary's gay coworkers who are now decked out in full on saturday night gay mode standing next to her.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{chex mix. i learned the hard way. i made out with a guy after eating like a bag of the stuff. he said my breath smelled like trout.}
<A>__{gigi puts her handful of chex mix back.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{thanks for the tip.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i'm sorry. that was rude. and that guy i made out with was a total asshole.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{you want me to smell you? i'm sure you don't smell like trout.}
<A>__{gigi laughs.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{thanks. i'm good.}
<A>__{she cups her hand and surreptitiously checks her breath.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i'm nathan. this is bruce.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{gigi. how do you guys know alex?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{we don't. our friend mary heard about it from some guy named conor.}
<A>__{gigi smiles in recognition.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{how do you know alex?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{i hope i mean i'm pretty sure something is about to happen between us.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{so, you're here as like a guest, or like his date?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i hate that when you don't know if you're a date so you don't know if you should bring a friend, or if you're like co hosting or if you should stay til the end to have alone time }
<A>__{suddenly, a look of doubt sweeps across gigi's face.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{he didn't really say.}
<A>__{she reflexively grabs for the chex mix and starts gorging on it again. nathan stops her.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{but i'm sure i'm more than just a guest. i mean there have been signs.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i did get a slight waft of trout, though. take a minterior}
<A>__{he reaches in his pocket. gigi looks at him gratefully.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{thank you.}
