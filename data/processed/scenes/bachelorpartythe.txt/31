<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior. bachelor's apartment (45 minutes later)}
<A>__{we are looking back up the living room as we were at the close of the last scene in this apartment. the room is absolutely dark now, but a light pours in from the foyer. in this shaft of light, we can see eddie moving from behind the projector to the wall switch and turning on the lights. the room is abruptly bright with light, and our five men squint against the sudden glare. they have all changed their positions and taken off their jackets and loosened their ties. they are lolling about. camera looks down to the floor to take particular note of eight empty beer bottles, an opened fifth of bourbon, ash trays, crumpled packs of cigarettes, a cup and saucer, somebody's shoes, somebody's jacket that has fallen off the back of a chair. over this we hear walter's voice:}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{is that the last one?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{a thick silence fills the room. there is a kind of sodden feeling to this scene. after a long moment, walter's voice again:}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{ah, you've seen one, you've seen them all.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah, they're all alike.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't know i think the first one was all right.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yeah, i was so bored by the rest of them. i nearly fell asleep during the last one.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{you in the habit of sleeping with your eyes open?}
<A>__{we look down on the room now, at all five of the men, eddie rewinding the last reel, the little motor of the projector humming. the others loll about, their legs dangling over the armrests of the soft chairs and sofas. there is a heavy, dense mood that no one seems willing to break.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what time's it about, anybody know?}
<C>__{arnold}
<P>__{(glancing at his watch)}
<D>__{i got a quarter to nine.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{no, it's later than that, about a quarter after.}
<A>__{again the silence falls upon the five men. only the humming little motor interrupts the thick silence. nobody moves.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{ah, you see one, you've seen them all.}
<A>__{again the silence. charlie stretches over for his bottle of beer on the floor beside his chair. he pours what's left of the bottle into the glass standing beside it. otherwise nobody moves.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{so that's the last one you've got to show us, eddie?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{yeah. you want to run them backwards?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{i wonder where they get the girls to make these movies?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{might as well go home, i guess.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{the idea doesn't seem to propel anybody to any decisive movement. walter shifts his position on the sofa, stretches out his legs, regards his shoes with a sudden sadness.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{life is short.}
<A>__{this gives everybody something to think about for a moment.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(hunched over}
<D>__{the projector,}
<P>__{dismantling it)}
<D>__{you guys feel like going down to have a drink for arnold?}
<A>__{this brings a reaction. walter stands.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yeah! what do you say? one last drink for arnold!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{okay with me.}
<A>__{suddenly life is back in the room, the men ad lib: "where's my coat?" "let's get out of here," etc.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(unwinding himself}
<D>__{from his slouched}
<P>__{position on a chair)}
<D>__{you can say what you want to about these pictures they're really pretty bad but they get you.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{don't you think we ought to clean up the place?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{no, i got a woman comes in.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(grabbing up his jacket)}
<D>__{i almost fell asleep during the last one.}
<P>__{(he looks at the others)}
<D>__{well, what do you say, huh? let's go! one last drink!}
<A>__{ad libs on exit.}
