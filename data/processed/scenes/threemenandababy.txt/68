<A>__{peter and michael get out of the elevator on mrs. razzolini's floor. they each are holding one of the handles on the basket. they are walking quickly. suddenly michael stops peter.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{wait i hear someone... i will go see...}
<A>__{peter waits with the basket. michael tiptoes to the corner of the corridor. at the very end of the corridor, on mrs. razzolini's doorstep, he sees the three narcotics agents talking with mrs. razzolini. we can hear snippets of their conversation.}
<C>__{razzolini}
<D>__{yes, i brought a package up to them... i think it was last sunday... agent #1 what are these people like? what kind of lifestyle do they have?}
<A>__{michael hastily returns to peter, still on tiptoes. he leads him back to the elevator and pushes the elevator button.}

<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{just as i thought the goddamn cops are grilling mrs. razzolini.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh shit! we sure as hell can't hand her the baby with an ass full of dope... right in front of the narcs!}

<P>__{(breaking down)}
<D>__{what should we do? i really gotta go...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{listen, she's just had her bottle. she's sleeping like a log. let's just leave her in the apartment. what can possibly happen to her? she's as regular as clockwork. she won't wake up till 8:30 and we'll easily be back by then...}
