<A>__{zed trots back to the poseidon vault door and quickly grabs a little gizmo from out of his briefcase. it is a little home made black box with a series of led's on it and two wires coming out of one side with alligator clips on the end. three other wires are also coming out of it. he slips the alligator clips into the hole and latches them. he then tapes one of the wires to the vault itself. the two remaining wires he hooks up to a large twelve volt battery.}
