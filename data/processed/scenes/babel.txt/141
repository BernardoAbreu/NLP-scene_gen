<L>__{exterior hamlet "los lobos" night}
<D>__{beer starts to flow and some of the guests get overbearing. there is a small scuffle at the edge of the dance floor, but order is soon restored. the guitarist in the band stops the music.}
<C>__{guitar player}
<P>__{(all in spanish)}
<D>__{now, luis and patricia, come forward. everyone makes way for the bride and groom.}
<C>__{guitar player }
<D>__{we want cake, we want cake... the audience and the band sing the little cake song. a giant, tacky wedding cake, covered in cream, arrives. the bride grabs the knife and gets ready to cut it.}
<C>__{guitar player }
<D>__{take a bite, take a bite... the bride gives into the ritual. she tries to take a bite out of the cake without using her hands and someone pushes her face into the cream. debbie and mike laugh. a cowboy pulls out a gun and, festively, fires. debbie is frightened and goes to hide behind amelia.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{don't worry, it's ok. the man puts the gun away and walks back onto the dance floor as if nothing had happened. luis asks the band to stop the music for a little bit and he takes the microphone.}
<C>__{luis}
<D>__{good evening everyone... hey... i want to say something. love came today, it came here all pretty...}
<P>__{(he taps his heart)}
<D>__{it's kind of like a little mouse is crawling inside of me. because that's what love is, it's like your insides get all twisted into knots... and that, baby, is what you've taught me. and because you've shown me, i want to tell everyone that hopefully love will get inside them too...because it feels so good, really...thanks a lot and keep havin' a good time... everybody applauds and luis steps down from the dais, proud of his speech. he goes to amelia and gives her a very long and loving hug.}
