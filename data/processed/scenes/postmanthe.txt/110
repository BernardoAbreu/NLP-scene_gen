<L>__{exterior r.v. park day}
<A>__{oregon's main post office. a silver airstream, fifty mobile homes and rusty winnebagos resting on flat tires. flying from a pole: the flag of the restored united states. a young recruit is ringing a bell on the top of a winnebago. ford walks along an rv boulevard. he's joined by two young carriers, red and chubby (the sentry from benning). all wear hip, personalized variations of the official uniform.}
<C>__{chubby}
<D>__{you got another letter?}
<A>__{they come around the corner to where seven young recruits wait. they're joined by another twenty carriers.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{more recruits?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{seven of them. they're coming from everywhere.}
<A>__{ford looks them over in satisfaction.}
<C>__{chubby}
<D>__{did you get a letter or didn't you?}
<A>__{ford smiles, reaches into his pocket. he pulls out a creased sheet of paper. chubby grins.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{gather 'round, everybody. got another letter here. came in last night.}
<A>__{buzzing with excitement, the carriers gather around ford.}
<B>__{south end of boulevard}
<A>__{ponytail leads abby and the postman. they come up in the back of the crowd. flanked by red and chubby, ford stands on the hood of a car, letter in hand. the postman taps a clueless young carrier on the back.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{what's all this?}
<C>__{young carrier}
<D>__{postman sent ford another letter. he's gonna read it.}
<C>__{ford}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{'hello, all postal carriers.'}
<C>__{carriers}
<P>__{(a ritual)}
<D>__{hello!}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i'm here in minneapolis with president starkey, but my thoughts are with you. remember, nothing worth doing can be done overnight. keep your chins up and do your best not to get shot. signed, the postman.}
<A>__{a buzz goes through the crowd. ponytail looks over.}
<C>__{ponytail}
<D>__{his letters are always kind of short.}
<A>__{abby and the postman exchange a look.}
<C>__{ford}
<P>__{(looks up)}
<D>__{hold on now. there's a p.s... anybody know what p.s. stands for?}
<A>__{the postman raises his hand. ford looks his way. his mouth drops as he realizes. in silence, he walks over to the postman. they embrace and all the weight ford's been carrying on his young shoulders suddenly falls to the postman. the kid nearly collapses.}
<C>__{chubby}
<D>__{holy shit...}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{that would be h.s., chubby.}
<C>__{chubby}
<D>__{i seen him once when i lived in benning. it's the postman!}
<A>__{word goes through the crowd like a wave. the postman takes the letter, reads.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{p.s. ford knows what to do.}
<A>__{ford shrugs sheepishly.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{guess you want to talk about this?}
<A>__{the postman takes ford by the elbow. they disappear into the tent. the carriers just staring after them, awestruck.}
<C>__{ponytail}
<D>__{i found him! i found him!}
<A>__{they clamor around her.}
