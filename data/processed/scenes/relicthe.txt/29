<A>__{margo sits up in the darkness, gasping. moonlight cuts across the bed. it takes a moment for her to realize that she's had a nightmare. she reaches for her light. as she switches it on, we see a photo on her bedside table. it shows a group on a mountain in tibet. there are several people with their arms slung around each other. at the end is a younger margo holding hands with john whittlesley. they appear to be more than friends. on margo... she looks at the photo a moment, then turns off the light and lies back, alone in her bed.}
