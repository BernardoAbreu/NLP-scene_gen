<C>__{man}
<D>__{well.}
<P>__{(putting on a good face)}
<D>__{it's nice to meet you.}

<D>__{it is... and it's so nice of you to greet us.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{thank you.}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{actually, we're here for the t.v.}
<A>__{he waits, half expecting this statement to be challenged. it isn't.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(confidently)}
<D>__{the people who left here our old neighbors left us that t.v.}

<D>__{do you need help?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{we can manage.}
<A>__{they move toward the front door, carol going backwards.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{thanks anyway.}
<A>__{nick looks to make eye contact with carol. he can't. she's looking back over her shoulder for obstacles. he smiles and glances toward the couple. nick and carol go out the door, lugging the t.v.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{nice meeting you.}
<A>__{the man and woman look at each other. they look around the room.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{they're not done painting.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{they'll finish.}
<A>__{she stares out the front door.}
<C>__{woman}
