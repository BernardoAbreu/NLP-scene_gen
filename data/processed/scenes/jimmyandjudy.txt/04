<T>__{camera on:}
<A>__{i e. jimmy's house backyard kitchen living room dusk late summer evening. camera operator wipes dirt from the lens with his shirt revealing his face for the first time as he looks at camera. this is the first time we get even a glimpse of jimmy wright (21). his looks are striking, even a bit awkward, but not at all unappealing. he throws a mischievously evil look at the lens, then settles his face back to normal. he spins the camera away, pointing it at the back of his house. through the kitchen window, jimmy zooms in on his mother (jimmy's mom) (40's) idyllic version of a mom in new millennium suburban housewife clothes. she's on the phone, preparing dinner.}

<D>__{hey mom, heard you and dad doing the nasty last night. thanks for that one. by the way, who the fuck is nancy?}
<A>__{camera whips over to jimmy's dad in the living room, well dressed, rich looking and fat in his late 40's, watching baseball on tv, tired after a long day's work. he drinks from a tumbler of expensive scotch neat with an ice cube, munching on mixed nuts from a crystal bowl.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{hey dad, mom's on the phone telling her friends that you're hung like a light switch.}
<A>__{dad reaches into his pants to give his balls a good scratch. jimmy gives the play by play like a baseball announcer.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{oh daddy, there he goes. he makes the reach and... yes! both balls at the same time! one heck of a double play!}
<A>__{eyes on the tv, dad takes his hands out of his pants and sniffs them.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{and the sniff to finish it off.}
<A>__{satisfied, dad reaches in and grabs a handful of nuts as he continues to watch tv. we zoom out to see both mom and dad, each through different windows.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{fucking freak show.}
