<A>__{a cluster of mourners stand before a tombstone in the distance. they are not in funeral dress, as this is not a funeral. it's a memorial. a beat up gypsy cab with a west indian driver pulls to a stop. from the trees and the sky we know its late spring early summer. a gorgeous day. tyler gets out of the cab, holding the rim of his empty coffee cup in his teeth. he sorts a rumpled wad of singles and hands some to the driver, who screeches into reverse. time is money. tyler crushes the coffee cup flat and slips it in his jacket pocket then lights up a smoke. he takes one long drag then extinguishes it and slips the butt into his pocket. he begins towards the mourners. his mother... diane hoffman, a beauty. past burdens etched in the lines on her face. dressed tastefully in expensive bohemian. she smiles like someone who's been crying but doesn't want anyone to know she has.}

<P>__{(sweetly)}
<D>__{hello, your majesty. how are you?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i'm fine... you look good...}
<A>__{he kisses his mother's hand and he's moving to greet his stepfather... les hoffman, unruly curls streaked in gray, tweed jacket and tie. they exchange a firm handshake and muttered hellos. the weight of tyler's gaze falls to caroline roth, his diminutive bespectacled, eleven year old sister. she's holding a little paper bag. she flashes him a look. he kneels besides her and whispers...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{thanks for organizing everybody.}
<A>__{caroline makes a face. turns her nose away from him.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you smell like listerine and beer.}
<A>__{he snorts and kisses her cheek. caroline reaches into her bag and takes out a handful of smooth white stones, on which she has painted the names: "mom" "tyler" "les", "dad", "caroline". she begins to arrange them in a little circle on the grave. tyler's father... charles roth, late fifties, breathes power, precisely dressed, two hundred dollar haircut. a predator.}

<P>__{(aside, to tyler)}
<D>__{you couldn't wear a tie?}
<A>__{tyler holds his father's eye.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{could have.}
<A>__{beat. charles adjusts his own collar like it's an explosive. pov: the tombstone. the four adult family members stand side by side. they look like strangers on the subway as caroline sits on the ground, arranging the stones.}
