<L>__{interior cindy's motel room later.}
<A>__{cindy is smoking next to the open window. she is nervous. a knock on the door. she throws the cigarette out the window and closes it. she checks herself in the mirror and opens the door. kyle is standing there.}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{kyle, honey, come in. i'm so glad you came.}
<A>__{she steps back and he enters.}
<C>__{cindy }
<D>__{have a seat, honey. do you want a soda or something?}
<A>__{he sits on one bed.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{no. what do you want?}
<A>__{she sits on the other facing him.}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{i just wanted to say how sorry i was about the match and if i did anything to cause it then i will never forgive myself. i know how much wrestling means to you, baby.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{is that why you called me. just to tell me that?}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{no. i also wanted to say that i will do whatever you think is best for leo. i promise.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{then leave him here. where he is.}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{ok. i will. if that's what you want. but i have to be honest, i'm not sure that's what leo wants.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{here. read this.}
<A>__{she hands him a piece of paper.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{it's the court transcript from when leo was in court. my lawyer got it. read the parts in yellow. see what it says.}
<A>__{kyle reluctantly reads it.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{this isn't real. the judge told leo he had to live there.}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{no, honey. this is official from the court. it's what mike said.}
<A>__{kyle reads it again.}
<C>__{cindy }
<D>__{he gets paid for being leo's guardian, kyle. and then he just put him in that place so he didn't have to worry about him.}
<A>__{kyle stares at the page.}
<C>__{cindy }
<D>__{leo belongs with us, kyle.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{cindy is caught of guard by the question.}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{why what?}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{why does he belong with us?}
<A>__{cindy judges her son's look and speaks from the heart.}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{because we deserve that money, kyle. not some lawyer. you're a big boy. you can understand that.}
<A>__{kyle looks at the page on more time and then suddenly, without warning, pounces on his mother pinning her to the bed. she screams. he gets in her face.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{shut up! shut up!}
<A>__{she finally quiets. terrified.}
<C>__{kyle }
<D>__{listen to me! i don't care about this. it's all bullshit. leave leo alone. he belongs here. do you hear me? do you?}
<A>__{cindy can only cry and nod. kyle grabs the paper and runs out the door.}
