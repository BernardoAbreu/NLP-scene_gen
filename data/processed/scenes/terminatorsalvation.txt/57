<C>__{blair}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{blair sighs, yawns, sits against a tree.}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{it's not far, but we'll never get across the mine field at night. might as well staf till morning.}
<A>__{marcus nods, sits a few feet away from her.}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{c'mere, it's cold. i don't bite.}
<A>__{marcus slides toward her, she nestles against him.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{staf? what's that mean?}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{it's a resistance term. sit tight and fuck.}
<A>__{soon they're kissing passionately. but marcus pulls away, rolls onto his back.}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{you holding out for lipstick? lingerie? or am i not your... type?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i'm not gay. in prison, i thought about puss women all the time. but now... it's not working. who knows, all those years on ice...}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{maybe it's just gonna take some time. before you're completely thawed out.}
<A>__{she's slipped a hand inside his pocket for warmth... now she pulls out the scraps of paper, with women's faces. she squints at these in the dark.}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{what are these?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i dunno. they just... sorta reminded me of her.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{who?}
<A>__{marcus speaks carefully, unsure how to articulate this.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{there's a woman, the last woman i saw before... when i was under, the dead time she kept coming to me. i think she must've saved me.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{i can't compete with that.}
<A>__{she closes her eyes, settling against him, her head against his chest. marcus stares up into the darkness.}
