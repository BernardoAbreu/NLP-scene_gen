<L>__{exterior underwater day}
<A>__{we see a miniature peeper squirming on the fish hook. a giant fanged fish engulfs the peeper's body. only his head is sticking out.}
<C>__{peeper}
<D>__{i deserve this!}
<L>__{exterior bar down the street day}
<A>__{several eleven year olds stumble out, drunk.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i just stole twenty five bucks off the bar. kid #2 how many beers did you have? kid # 3 eight sips.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i had five! i'm so wasted.}
<A>__{they both high five, throw up and fall. pan over to adrian sitting on top of a mailbox laughing as he sips from a bottle of peppermint schnapps.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{when an adult goes to hell, that's terrific. but when a child goes... that's why i'm in this business.}
<A>__{adrian looks across the street and sees nicky walking with valerie. he's shocked. valerie is holding up a pair of drawstring pants from her collection.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{so you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{basically, yeah.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{wow. maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.}
<A>__{valerie laughs.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{you know what's nice about you? you just seem happy being yourself. you don't try to act cool.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{thanks much. you know what's nice about you, valerie?}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{up the street, adrian's eyes redden. nicky looks like he's been stunned by something.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{your juicy, heart shaped ass.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{nicky}
<P>__{(shocked and confused)}
<D>__{i...i don't know why i just said that. i meant to say that...}
