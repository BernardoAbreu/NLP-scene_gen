<L>__{exterior hanalei bay cottage night}
<A>__{zero hour. matt and alexandra approach the cottage from the road and start to walk around it toward the beach.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{are you ready?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no. what should i say?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{you'll think of something. you're a lawyer.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i'm sorry for sucking you into this. i should be doing this alone. it's selfish of me.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{i'm the one who sucked you in. i'm the one who knew.}
<A>__{just as they are round the house toward the lanai, julie speer backs out of the screen door with a plate of hamburger patties. alex nudges matt.}
<C>__{alexandra }
<D>__{don't be a pussy.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(stiffly)}
<D>__{hi there!}
<A>__{the screen door slams. julie looks over.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{it's the guy from the beach today.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{oh, hello.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah, hey, i'm such an idiot. i just figured out i do know your husband. my daughter and i were on our way back to the hotel from dinner, and we thought we'd drop by and say howdy.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<P>__{(mouthing)}
<D>__{howdy?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{great. come on up.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i'm matt king. this is alexandra.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i'm julie speer. yeah, i thought that was you.}
<C>__{julie }
<D>__{you've been in the paper so much lately. i figured you had to know brian. he's been pretty involved.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah, no, i know, yeah, super involved. maybe i've met him in passing. i don't know.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{so, i guess you guys are deciding really soon. a couple of days, right you and your family meet? i'm sorry. that's probably a conflict of interest or something.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no, it's okay. you're right it'll all be over in a couple of days.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{you guys want a burger?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{we just ate, thanks.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{a drink then.}
<A>__{as alex and matt agree, a figure appears at the screen door. brian speer emerges, a bag of buns in one hand.}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{hi, i'm brian.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{brian, we may have met before. matt king. my wife is elizabeth king. i think you may have met her too. our daughter alexandra.}
<A>__{brian's big grin wilts.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i was just going to get drinks.}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{good, good. good.}
<A>__{matt nudges alexandra, who suddenly remembers her duty.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{do you need help?}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(over her shoulder)}
<D>__{no, no, i got it.}
<A>__{alex is glad to keep her ringside seat for the moment. all buckle their mental seatbelts.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{elizabeth is dying. oh, wait. fuck you. and she's dying. we unhooked her from the machines this morning. she'll be dead in a few days.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{we're not here to hurt you. we just thought she'd want you to know.}
<A>__{as they've plotted, alex and matt study brian's paralyzed face. they exchange a glance, then look back at him.}
<C>__{alexandra }
<D>__{this is him? why would she go for him?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{beats me. well, he's very articulate.}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{i can't... i'm sorry. i never thought it would come to this.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{you're sorry my mom's going to die? you're sorry you fucked her? you're sorry you fucked over my dad?}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{i'm sorry for all of it.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{look, pal, like she said, i'm not here to wreck your life. i just came to give you a chance to go to the hospital. i don't know how long you're planning on being here, but i'm sure you can think of an excuse to leave.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{you must be good at that.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you can be alone with her to say goodbye or whatever you want. do you hear what i'm saying?}
<A>__{brian seems deeply lost in his own thoughts. then }
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{okay, look, i can't have you here. you understand.}
<A>__{julie returns with wine for matt and a soda for alex.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{here we go.}
<P>__{(noticing)}
<D>__{everyone's so serious. please don't tell me you're talking about business.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{we're talking about love.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{that's nice. brian, call the boys in for dinner.}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{they're fine. let them play a while longer.}
<A>__{they all stand there a moment. matt's unsure how to play this out. he shoots a quick panicked look at alex, who scrambles to keep the ball rolling.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{awesome cottage you're renting.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah, say, prime hanalei location. i used to come here as a kid before it was a vacation rental. alex, your great uncle warren and aunt lillian built it back in the 20s. haven't been inside in years.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{come on. we'll give you a tour.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{or, brian, maybe you could give my dad a little walk down memory lane, and julie and i can chat out here.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah, i'd like that, if you don't mind. just a quick look.}
<C>__{brian speer}
<D>__{sure. but it's not like i live here.}
<A>__{matt walks up to the door, making a point to let brian open it for him.}
