<L>__{exterior in the village day}
<A>__{the magistrate hears the approaching shouts. he and thirty more of his men are barricaded around the village square.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{don't look surprised! we knew he'd bring friends!}
<A>__{the see wallace gallop into sight; but he stops, then heads down a side street. the magistrate and his men don't like this; where did he go? which way will he come from? and then they hear the horses, and see the other scots, at the head of the main street. the soldiers unleash a volley of arrows at them. they are loading to fire again when wallace runs in on foot! and cuts down two soldiers! the other scots charge! the startled soldiers break and run in every direction. the magistrate, abandoned, runs too. wallace pursues. not far along a twisting lane, the bulky magistrate falters. he turns to fight, and wallace slashes away his sword.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{no! i beg you... mercy!}
<B>__{in the town square}
<A>__{as the scots see wallace, they break off pursuing the english soldiers and stop to watch; dragging the magistrate by his hair, wallace hauls him back into the village square, slams him against the well, and stands over him with heaving lungs and wild eyes, staring at marion's murderer.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{please. mercy!}
<A>__{wallace's eyes shift, falling on}
<B>__{the stain of blood}
<A>__{marion's blood, in a dark dry splash by the wall of the well, the stain dripping down onto the dirt of the street. wallace spins, jerks back the magistrate's head, and cuts his throat with the sword.}
<B>__{on the other scots}
<A>__{silenced by what they've just seen and done. on old campbell's face is a look of reverence, and awe.}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{say grace to god, lads. we've just seen the coming of the messiah.}
<A>__{william staggers a few steps, and collapses to his knees. and then not just the scottish farmers but the townspeople too begin a strange, hi lo chant.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{ahhhhhhh uhhhhhh! ahhhhhh uhhhhhh!}
<A>__{william's wild eyes slowly regain their focus. and there in the dirt beside the well, he sees the severed cloth strip he gave to marion, now stained with her blood. he lifts it, crushes it in his hand, as the highlanders chant for war.}
