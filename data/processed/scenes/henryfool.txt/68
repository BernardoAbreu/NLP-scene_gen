<L>__{interior publishing house reception day}
<A>__{angus throws on his coat and thrusts the poem at simon as they walk down the hall.}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{this is really quite unbelievably bad, my friend. i mean, i'm all for experimentation and i've made a career out of a healthy disregard for convention, but... look, this is profoundly irrelevant material. this is only my opinion. but it's an opinion i value highly. goodnight, laura. call norton press. we're still on for tomorrow.}
<A>__{simon looks pale as angus strides towards the elevator.}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{i've been wrong before as a publisher. but i refuse to admit i've ever been wrong as a reader. you have talent, i admit. you have an innate sense of the musicality of language. a good ear, maybe. but you do nothing significant with it. and this twisted reasoning that poses as... conviction or insight, it's... well, it's embarrassing.}
<A>__{they reach the elevator and stop. simon tries to catch his breath.}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{why did you bring this thing to me, anyway?}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{a friend of mine spoke of you. he said you had a lot of integrity.}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{yes, well, of course, i do. but i'm not crazy, am i? who is this person? do i know him?}
<A>__{simon hesitates, almost decides against it, but then...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{henry fool.}
<A>__{angus looks back at him. simon waits. angus looks aside, thinks, then shakes his head.}
<C>__{angus}
<D>__{never heard of him.}
<A>__{simon just looks at him blankly, confused. the doors slide open and angus gets in the elevator. he's gone. simon sinks into a chair and stares at the carpet. he is so surprised and hurt he gasps for breath. his poem slips from his hand and falls to the floor.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{i remember henry.}
<A>__{simon doesn't register this right away. but then he looks up and over at the receptionist. laura stands and comes around her desk. she pauses, seeing his disappointment, then comes closer and picks up his poem. handing it to him, she explains...}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{he used to be the janitor here.}
<A>__{he just stares at her, demolished.}
