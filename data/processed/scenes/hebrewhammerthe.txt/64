<L>__{interior cavernous room moments later}
<A>__{we appear to be in what looks like the loading dock for an 'it's a small world after all' type water ride. harriet leads esther and the hammer into one of the waiting cars. the cars kind of have a baby moses straw basket theme going on. the 'let my people go' song, piped from unseen speakers, is now at full strength.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{you saved our lives. thank you. how can i ever repay you...?}
<C>__{harriet tubbelman}
<D>__{...my name is harriet tubbelman, but you can call me moses. the only payment i ask mordechai, is that you keep hanukkah safe for us all.}
<A>__{she hands each of them a ticket and then lowers the lap restraints for hammer and esther, testing them to make sure they're secure.}
<C>__{harriet tubbelman }
<D>__{you should be safe from here on out. just follow the river to it's conclusion.}
<A>__{she begins to walk away, but then catches herself as she turns back to face them.}
<C>__{harriet tubbelman }
<D>__{oh yeah, and keep your arms and legs inside the water craft at all times.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{where are we? what is this place?}
<A>__{she smiles with great pride.}
<C>__{harriet tubbelman}
<D>__{welcome to the underground jewish railroad. just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.}
<A>__{the brakes on the water craft release, and the craft makes it way from the loading dock. wide eyed, esther and hammer check out their surroundings. hasidic animatronic puppets sing of thousands of years of jewish oppression and persecution in an educational, yet oddly entertaining way. the hammer puts his arm around esther and continues to check out the attraction in wonderment. esther secretly glances at him affectionately. it's clear she's falling for him. we cut to a wide shot as we watch the craft disappear down the river. a funkdafied version of the "let my people go" song fades up and over the gospel version from the ride.}
