<A>__{it has stopped at the curb just beyond the entrance to the mini mart parking lot. mr. brooks and mr. smith watch the driver come around the front of another car before entering the store. the light reveals the driver to be a tall middle age preppie guy with close cropped dark hair and dark rimmed glasses.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{would you recognize him if you saw his driver's license picture?}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i've memorized the license number, you write it down. when you get home go on the internet and find out everything you can about this guy.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{we aren't going to kill him tonight?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{no. we could, but then we wouldn't be in control. we could leave loose ends, and we both know the danger of that.}
