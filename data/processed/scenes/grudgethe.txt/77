<A>__{dark and still. lying in wait. completely silent, except someone's knocking on the front door.}

<A>__{they're still knocking.}

<A>__{apparently, whoever's knocking isn't going to give up the door handle jiggles. but it's locked.}
<L>__{66 exterior the house kitchen night}
<A>__{karen's cell phone lays on the table in the foreground. beyond is the hallway, and the front door. the knocking has stopped. silence. then karen's cell phone suddenly lights up, ringing. it rings four times, then goes to voice mail.}
<L>__{interior the house bathroom night}
<A>__{a new sound breaks the silence: movement outside. crunching footsteps on gravel, someone brushing past tree limbs. a shadow falls over the window. a face looks inside it's alex, karen's boss. he walks away from the window and continues down the side of the house we track down the hallway, past the bathroom, through the kitchen, following his progress into the back room: alex is visible through the sliding door leading to the back porch. he peers inside. his pov: a figure covered head to toe in a white sheet lies on the mattress. unmoving. alex tries the sliding door it's open. he steps inside.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{karen?}
<A>__{silence greets him. he stares down at the figure in the bed. alex licks his lips, nervous. finally walks to the mattress, kneeling down next to it. raises a hand and grabs the sheet. raises it over the head it's emma. as we last saw her, eyes on the ceiling, mouth and eyes wide open in fear. but now it's clear, from the tache noire in the eyes, the blanched skin, the rigidity of her body: she's dead. alex falls back onto his butt, staring at emma. he pulls himself away from the corpse and freezes. there's something right behind him. he whirls around it's karen. in the corner, looking pale and dazed.}
