<L>__{exterior queenshithe slaughterhouse establishing night}
<A>__{an industrial area on a bend of the thames. work doesn't stop when the sun goes down. wharves stretch out into the water. we see a boat is being loaded. we pull back from the scene and look across the water. just above the thump of industry we can hear a distinctive and irregular chugging sound. slowly a decrepit and eccentric little steam launch chugs into view. holmes is on the deck along with a much older man in a sailor's hat captain tanner.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{everything all right, captain tanner?}
<A>__{captain tanner has few teeth and a large white beard.}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{just a little leak, nothing to worry about.}
<A>__{watson is busy with a bucket clearing the boat of a very serious leak. he's soaked, and furious.}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{not a great one for the water, are you, doctor? army type, aren't you? you wouldn't have lasted long in the navy.}
<A>__{watson glares. holmes scans the banks with a telescope. he sees a jetty with a few shadows shifting on it. the engine shudders off, the boat drifts. tanner whispers:}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{that's as far as we can go.}
<A>__{holmes starts clambering over the side. watson's pissed.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{there must be fifty yards of mud out there.}
<A>__{holmes' head is just visible before he drops over the prow. he whispers at tanner.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{pull in at vauxhall. send for the police when you get there.}
<A>__{tanner nods. a soft "splosh" as holmes disappears. watson carefully leaves his valued possessions behind, watch, etc. he lays down his wallet and looks at tanner.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i know precisely how much money is in there.}
<C>__{tanner}
<P>__{(taking the piss)}
<D>__{i am sure you do, doctor.}
<A>__{watson glares, goes over the side, with his walking stick.}
