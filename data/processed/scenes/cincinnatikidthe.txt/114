<L>__{interior bill's suite}
<A>__{bill and the kid are sitting at a room service table. bill nibbles at some cheese and crackers while the kid tackles a large steak. felix, the chauffeur, stands in attendance on them.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i thought it would be better if you and i sat down together to see if we couldn't work out our differences. felix!}
<A>__{he motions to felix, indicating a wine bottle on the table. felix steps over and refills the kid's glass.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{what i told the shooter goes.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{are you saying no before we've even discussed it? am i to feel all my arguments will be wasted?}
<A>__{the kid just looks at him then returns to his meal.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i will skip to the final argument.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{more salad, perhaps?}
<A>__{he makes a peremptory gesture to felix, who springs forward to offer the salad bowl to the kid.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the shooter will be back dealing when you start again. he will give you an occasional helpful card.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{that's an argument?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that's a fact. i'm coming to the argument.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{i will give you a fact. i won't let it happen.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{is that knife sharp enough? felix.}
<A>__{felix jumps into action again. he moves to the kid's side, reaches into a breast pocket and takes out a switch blade, which he clocks open an inch or two from the kid's neck. it is an extremely ugly looking and menacing weapon.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{see if it cuts better with that.}
<A>__{felix hands the knife to the kid, who tries it on his steak.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{sharp?}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{very. but it don't cut any ice with me.}
<A>__{he jams the knife in the table and snaps off the blade.}
<C>__{the kid}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{not this time. he exits.}
