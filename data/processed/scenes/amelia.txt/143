<L>__{interior radio room morning}
<D>__{a few others enter now. civilians, sailors, they hang back silently, watching as... superimpose: 7:42 a.m.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{khaqq calling itasca. we must be on you but cannot see you... glances are traded. it is the first moment of visible concern. static interrupts. then... amelia (o.s.) (contâ€™d) gas is running low. been unable to reach you by radio. we are flying at altitude 1000 feet.}
<C>__{dalten }
<D>__{you are reaching us. we are sending on 3105 and 500 constantly. please acknowledge. massive burst of static. dalten frantically clicking a message in morse code. dissolve to: superimpose: 7:58 a.m. the room has nearly filled. commander thompson stands at bellart's shoulder. all eyes fixed on the radio...}
<C>__{earhart }
<D>__{we are circling but cannot hear you. go ahead on 7500.}
<C>__{bellarts }
<D>__{itasca to khaqq. your signal is strong. are you receiving this? a breathless moment. a sharp crackle.}
<C>__{earhart }
<D>__{khaqq calling itasca. we received your signal, but unable to get a minimum. please take bearing on us and answer 3105 with voice.}
<C>__{bellarts }
<D>__{your signal received okay. it is impractical to take a bearing on 3105 on your voice. give us a longer signal, please. go ahead. silence. feet are shifting. no one speaks.}
<C>__{bellarts }
<D>__{keep us at 7500, that's her only acknowledgment.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{you've got her signal, dammit. what about the direction finder?}
<C>__{bellarts}
<D>__{cipriani reports the battery's dead, sir. it was left on all night.}
