<A>__{charlie is examining the kitchen closely. a black cook is working hard, taking a piece of meat off the grill. he carefully prepares a dish.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{hi charlie.}
<A>__{charlie smiles and moves in closer to the grill. the cook is sweating and mopping his brow.}
<C>__{cook}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{man, it's hot as hell in here, every day like going through hell in here.}
<A>__{charlie moves in closer and the cook continues preparing the food.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{hot as hell...you're not the only one going through hell kid.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{maybe so...but at this pay it ain't worth it...that much i can tell you.}
<A>__{charlie hasn't been listening to the cook. he has become fascinated with the flames on the grill. they remind him of an old device from his catholic school days. charlie brings his hand forward and closer to the fire, testing the pain of the "fires of hell."}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(confession)}
<D>__{'if thy hand is an occasion of sin to thee, cut it off. it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire. 'where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched.'}
<A>__{charlie's hand touches the flame. he winces. music in.}
