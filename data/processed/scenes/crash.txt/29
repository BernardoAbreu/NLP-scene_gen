<A>__{james enters the gate of the police pound on foot, and shows his pass to the guard at the gate. his pass now stamped, he hesitates for a beat before he enters.}
<L>__{interior police pound day}
<A>__{some twenty or so crashed vehicles are parked in the sunlight against the rear wall of an abandoned cinema. at the far end of the asphalt yard is a truck whose entire driving cabin has been crushed, as if the dimensions of space had abruptly contracted around the body of the driver. unnerved by these deformations, james moves from one car to the next until he comes to his own. the remains of towing tackle are attached to the front bumper, and the body panels are splashed with oil and dirt. he peers through the windows into the cabin, runs his hand over the mud stained glass. without thinking, he kneels in front of the car and stares at the crushed fenders and radiator grill. two policemen cross the yard with a black alsatian dog. they watch james hovering around his car as if they vaguely resent his touching it. when they are gone, he unlatches the driver's door and, with an effort, pulls it open. james eases himself on to the dusty vinyl seat, tipped back by the bowing of the floor. he nervously lifts his legs into the car and places his feet on the rubber cleats of the pedals, which have been forced out of the engine compartment so that his knees are pressed against his chest. the two policemen are exercising their dog across the yard. james opens the glove compartment, forcing the shelf downwards. inside, covered with dirt and flaked plastic, are a set of route maps, a mildly pornographic novel, a polaroid of renata sitting in the car near a water reservoir with her breasts exposed. james pulls open the ashtray, which promptly jumps on to his lap, releasing a dozen lipstick smeared butts. someone passes in front of the car. a policeman's voice calls from the gatehouse. through the windshield, james sees a woman in a white raincoat walking along the line of wrecked cars. the woman helen remington approaches the car next to his, a crushed convertible involved in a massive rear end collision. james sits quietly behind the steering wheel. helen turns from the convertible. she glances at the hood of james's car, clearly not recognizing the vehicle that killed her husband. as she raises her head she sees james through the glassless windshield frame, sitting behind the deformed steering wheel among the dried bloodstains of her husband. helen's strong eyes barely change their focus, but one hand rises involuntarily to her cheek. she takes in the damage to the car, then takes in james. without giving away anything, she turns and moves toward a damaged truck, then turns and comes back as james gets out of his car. she gestures toward the damaged vehicles, then speaks to james as though continuing a conversation already in progress.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{after this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm trying to find charles's car.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{it's not here. maybe the police are still holding it. their forensic people...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{they said it was here. they told me this morning.}
<A>__{she peers critically at james's car, as if puzzled by its distorted geometry.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{this is your car?}
<A>__{she reaches out a gloved hand and touches the radiator grill, feeling a chrome pillar torn from the accordion, as if searching for some trace of her husband's presence among the blood spattered paintwork.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{you'll tear your gloves.}
<A>__{james gently takes her hand and moves it away from the grill.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i don't think we should have come here. i'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{were you badly hurt? i think we saw each other at the hospital.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i don't want the car. in fact, i was appalled to find that i have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{can i give you a lift?}
<P>__{(almost apologetically)}
<D>__{i somehow find myself driving again.}
