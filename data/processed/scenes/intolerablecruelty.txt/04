<L>__{interior gym close on}
<A>__{a woman walking across a gymnasium floor. suddenly, she's assaulted by a huge, grotesquely garbed assailant. his sweats barely cover his massive, overdeveloped musculature. on his head, a ski mask stretches over a padded football helmet. he grabs the woman, yanks her back towards him. she reacts swiftly. with a ferocious "no," she stomps on his foot, and smashes him in the face. the mugger raises his hands in a gesture of submission.}
<B>__{applause}
<A>__{we pull back and see that we are in a self defense class. two instructors, two "muggers" and ten women students all wearing t shirts with the words impact personal safety. marylin and sarah sit against the wall.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{i don't know what his game is. he dismissed every one of ruth's proposals. and sarah, we weren't unreasonable.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{well what does he want?}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{i don't know. ruth kept her cool, but i could tell she was surprised.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{he has a reputation for being tough.}
<A>__{marylin watches as a new "victim" begin her walk across the gym.}
<C>__{marylin}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{lilly's up.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{oh, god!}
<A>__{the mugger emerges from his station and makes his way toward the "victim." she glances over her shoulder, and at the sight of the monster bearing down on her, screams and runs to the exit. marylin and sarah giggle, but reproachful looks from the other students force them to affect concerned looks.}
<C>__{marylin}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{every week }
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i'm dying.}
<A>__{the two instructors and the mugger try to coax the sobbing woman back into the room. they clasp her in an empathic group hug.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{anyway, even rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. if i didn't know better, i'd swear massey had some personal investment in my ruination.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{so where are you now?}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{well, if he continues to maintain this position we're in court.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{get this! he called and invited me to dinner.}
<A>__{the instructor, a vivacious phys ed major, approaches marylin.}
<C>__{instructor}
<D>__{marylin? ready.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{huh? oh, yeah. sure.}
<A>__{marylin gets up and coolly walks to center stage, passing the traumatized lilly.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{that's completely odd.}
<A>__{marylin begins the victim walk. the mugger quickly moves up from the rear.}
<C>__{marylin}
<P>__{(to sarah)}
<D>__{i know. that's why i accepted. find out what's up with this clown.}
<A>__{the mugger is upon her. he grabs her hair. she stomps his foot, and smoothly wheels around smashing him in the nose with her elbow, while kneeing him in the groin. the women cheer.}
<C>__{instructor}
<D>__{that was excellent, marylin. but you forgot to yell "no."}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{ah.}
<P>__{(calmly, to the mugger)}
<D>__{no.}
