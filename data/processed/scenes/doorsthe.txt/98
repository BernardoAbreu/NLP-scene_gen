<L>__{interior jim and pam's house laurel canyon that day}
<A>__{the food is laid out, the duck cooking... but no one is there as we move across this tastefully decorated house to pamela in the living room, rattled, obsessively going through jim's papers. people are knocking at the door. guests looking through the windows, tapping. a giant poster of marilyn monroe frames pamela.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{what am i going to do about these papers! jim, jim you really need someone to organize this stuff. your handwriting's just like a little kid.}
<A>__{jim is somewhere else pulling out the duck which is totally charred black. he laughs.}
<C>__{pam}

<A>__{you're lost little girl you're lost little girl you're lost, tell me who are you? people are introducing themselves, coming in from all over, like in a shoebox. hippies. doors people... now tom baker with mike and dog... now an aggressive chuck berry type black singer with john's girlfriend. then a timothy leary look alike appears. chatter blending everywhere as we build to a vast confusion at jim and pam's party.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{let's go wild child, let's get out there romeo and juliet, marilyn monroe and vincent van gogh, jim and pam, rock and roll}
