<L>__{exterior hitchcock house, swimming pool a few days later}
<A>__{alma does afternoon laps in the pool. a contemplative hitchcock wanders down to the pool side wearing black sunglasses and a business suit. he watches alma a moment. finally she notices him.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{you're back early.}
<A>__{he shrugs, then sits at the table to pour himself a glass of lemonade. alma gets out and towels herself off.}
<C>__{alma }
<D>__{i'm disappointed you didn't give whit's book a chance.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{what about him?}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{he knows you well enough.}
<A>__{she sits down next to him, noticing a tiny hole in her swimsuit. it's starting to look a little threadbare.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{enjoy the pool now. we might not have it for that much longer.}
<A>__{he looks off cryptically.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{paramount refuses to finance the movie. imagine the studio that brought you martin and lewis and the greatest show on earth considers psycho distasteful.}
<A>__{he brushes some fallen leaves off his chair.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{lew can't find the money. not quickly enough at least.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{why not wait?}
<A>__{he doesn't reply. she knows him well enough too and doesn't question him further.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{we're going to have to go it alone, old girl.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we'll finance the movie ourselves.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{are we going to have to sell the entire house or just the pool?}
<A>__{she looks at hitch but he's not joking. she turns to survey their beloved home and gardens. a long pause.}
<C>__{alma }
<D>__{tell me and i won't ever ask again. why this one, hitch? it's not just because so many people are telling you 'no,' is it?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{alma }
<D>__{hitch?}
<A>__{without turning he takes her hand.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{remember the fun we had when we started out and there was so little money and time? we took risks, we experimented. we invented new ways of making pictures because we had to.}
<A>__{a long moment as he gazes across the pool.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{i want to feel that kind of freedom again.}
<A>__{he turns to look into her eyes for the first time. a glimpse of the real hitchcock. someone even his wife doesn't see that often...}
