<L>__{exterior forest road day}
<A>__{autumn. the forest is a mosaic of green, gold, orange, and red. a giant eye in a circle of glass. aslan, his telescope raised.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{here they come.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{two wagons. twenty escort.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{twenty? they usually have five.}
<A>__{he grabs the telescope.}
<B>__{scope pov}
<A>__{a phalanx of mounted soldiers, a cart loaded with barrels, and a tax wagon. the wagon is an armored box on wheels, with crossbow slits in the side. guy of gisborne commands the escort.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{this is no ordinary convoy.}
<A>__{bull calls up from below, where a ragged group of woods men lies nervously in ambush.}
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{'ow many?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{er, about ten.}
<P>__{(then, to aslan)}
<D>__{why scare them? they can't count anyway.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{and they call me the barbarian.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{together they run down the hill, keeping low. gisborne eyes the forest. the beer cart is steered by a fat red faced friar, raucously singing hymns and quaffing from a jug, which he repeatedly dips into one of the barrels. arrows whistle in. the friar yells and drops his jug. a soldier is hit. at the forest edge, four woodsmen reload their longbows. dressed in green, their faces camouflaged. the mounted soldiers charge them. the woodsmen run into the trees. as the horsemen close in, the runners leap into a trench. lift up matted screens of brush and grass. it's as if they disappeared. the soldiers slash wildly at the thick screens. more arrows fly. more soldiers fall. the others spin in confusion, trying to discern the enemy. more woods men break from cover. run down a narrow path. gisborne urges his men to pursue. they ride in single file, beating their way through the tangled branches. the runners dive into the trees, as other men haul on ropes, raising a giant screen in the soldiers' path. the horses swerve, on the edge of a twenty foot drop to the river gorge. momentum carries many of them over the cliff.}
<B>__{back on roadway}
<A>__{robin and aslan swing down from the trees onto the tax wagon. kick down the two drivers and take the reins, steering the wagon off the road. the archers inside are unable to fire at them. little john leaps onto the beer cart, sending the friar hurtling back among the barrels. the friar slams his head and drops unconscious. john whips the horse, driving the cart after robin. another camouflage screen is lifted into place, covering their route. gisborne races back to the road... the wagons are gone. he rides frantically back and forth. searching and cursing.}
