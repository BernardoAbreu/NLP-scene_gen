<L>__{exterior building roof day}
<A>__{on the roof, malik bursts through the stairwell door. his two men have followed him. malik stops suddenly when he sees dana standing at the edge of the roof. she is holding the arming key by its chain. dangling it over the edge. he signals to his men not to fire.}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(terrified, but thinking)}
<D>__{you shoot me, this'll fall.}
<A>__{malik advances slowly, his eyes glistening ferally. she backs up a step with each of his, moving along the edge of the roof. malik keeps his pistol aimed at her chest.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{don't come any closer. i will drop it! i swear to god.}
<C>__{malik}
<D>__{if you drop it, i will have no reason not to kill you.}
<A>__{he advances, calling her bluff. she backs away from him along the edge.}
<C>__{malik}
<D>__{come on, child. give me the key.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{don't you want to live? i give you my word.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{no way you whacko.}
<A>__{she reaches the corner of the building. her back touches something. it is the boom of a small crane, used for lifting building supplies. careful to keep the key dangling over open space, dana climbs up on the lattice work boom and moves out beyond the edge of the building, never taking her eyes off malik. she is hyperventilating, terrified, but thinking clearly. malik steps up on the crane, crawling out after her. he knows she will not drop the key as long as he has the gun. it is a game which will end when she reaches the end of the boom. dana puts the key between her teeth so she can hang on better. it is windy and the boom is swinging.}
