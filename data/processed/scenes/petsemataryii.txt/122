<A>__{drew throws the latch on the door. almost immediately, gus is outside, pounding at the door with the claw end of the hammer. wood splinters fly as the hammer claw sinks through... drew screams and goes for one of the dormer windows. it's stuck; he can't get it open. from the hallway, gus violently smashes the door again and again. the door is splintering apart. we see glimpses of gus through the ragged holes.}
