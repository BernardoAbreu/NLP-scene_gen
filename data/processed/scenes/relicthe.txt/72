<L>__{exterior museum side door day}
<A>__{a series of boxes labeled "professor frock" sit on the loading dock. a small moving van, partially loaded with the contents of frock's office, sits waiting. frock delves through one of the boxes while pendergast and d'agosta look on.}

<D>__{i know they're here somewhere. it's a good thing we caught the movers in time. they're nineteen century blueprints from when the museum was built. i remember the sub basement was below the regular basement, linked to the city sewer. i only know about it because it flooded all the way up to the museum during the hurricane of '49. i lost so many precious books.}
<A>__{frock continues to unload boxes, scattering things right and left. it's the most amazing assortment of paraphernalia. a collection of wildflowers, soil samples, a stuffed owl. finally he pulls out some very old blueprints and flashes a triumphant smile.}

<D>__{eureka. who says it doesn't pay to be a pack rat? now please be careful with these. when you're done, i'd like them back.}
