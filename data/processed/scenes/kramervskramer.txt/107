<A>__{he stops in mid sentence, looks around.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{on the walls are a series of mock ups of the various fire and ice ads, none of which are what ted and o'connor had agreed upon.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(surprised)}

<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{i think they're kind of interesting.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(bugged)}
<D>__{i don't. jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about. it's not even close.}
<C>__{murray}
<P>__{(oily)}
<D>__{ted, basically it's still your concept.}
<C>__{o'connor}

<D>__{ted, i appreciate what you're saying, but i really think you're just too close to it right now.}
<C>__{o'connor}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{murray's right.}
