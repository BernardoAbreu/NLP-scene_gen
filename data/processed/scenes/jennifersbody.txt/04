<L>__{interior "the hole" same}
<A>__{needy is tossed into seclusion. her hair is wild and her face is wet with tears. the heavy door slams behind her, leaving only a shaft of light.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{i wasn't always this cracked. i used to be normal well, as normal as any girl under the influence of teenage hormones. but after the killings began, i started to feel, i don't know... loose around the edges or something. i was coming undone like those jeans i made in home ec. falling to pieces like patsy cline. shredded like moo shu pork. dead inside.}
<A>__{needy cringes as she briefly hallucinates abstract shapes in the darkness. grinning skulls. faces drained of life, half eaten. grimaces of terror. suddenly, soft music is piped into "the hole," ostensibly to calm the patients in solitary. needy shudders and recoils at the sound of it. it's a cheesy rock ballad that we'll soon hear again...}
<C>__{cheesy song lyrics}
<D>__{"through the trees, i will find you. heal the ruins left inside you. and the stars will remind you, we'll meet again..."}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{god, i hate this fucking song.}
<A>__{needy plugs her ears as if it physically hurts her to listen to the song. she curls up in the corner and steels herself for solitary confinement.}
