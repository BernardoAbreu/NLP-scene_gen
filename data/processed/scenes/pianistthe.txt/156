<A>__{szpilman enters, closing the small door behind him. he leans back, resting, recovering. and then he hears from down below a piano playing a beethoven piece. after a few bars, the music stops. szpilman listens anxiously. silence. he looks around, finding himself in an attic space filled with junk, a ladder, rotting material, travelling trunks. last light of day filtering through a dormer window. there's a ladder leading up to a trapdoor. szpilman climbs the ladder. he crawls into a small empty space. with enormous effort he pulls up the ladder and closes the trapdoor. exhausted and trying to catch his breath, he gazes at the unopened tin. he peers through the darkness but sees nothing. his eyes begin to droop.}
