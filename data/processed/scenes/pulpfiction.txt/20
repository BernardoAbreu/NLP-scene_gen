<L>__{interior lance's bedroom night}
<A>__{lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly appearance that goes hand in hand with his wild and woolly personality. lance has been selling drugs his entire adult life. he's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and has never been arrested. he wears a red flannel shirt over a "speed racer" tee shirt. three bags of heroin lie on lance's bed. lance and vincent stand at the foot of the bed.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{now this is panda, from mexico. very good stuff. this is bava, different, but equally good. and this is choco from the hartz mountains of germany. now the first two are the same, forty five an ounce those are friend prices but this one...}
<P>__{(pointing to the choco)}
<D>__{...this one's a little more expensive. it's fifty five. but when you shoot it, you'll know where that extra money went. nothing wrong with the first two. it's real, real, real, good shit. but this one's a fuckin' madman.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{remember, i just got back from amsterdam.}

<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{that's a bold statement.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{this ain't amsterdam, vince. this is a seller's market. coke is fuckin' dead as disco. heroin's comin' back in a big fuckin' way. it's this whole seventies retro. bell bottoms, heroin, they're as hot as hell.}
<A>__{vincent takes out a roll of money that would choke a horse to death.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{give me three hundred worth of the madman. if it's as good as you say, i will be back for a thousand.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{i just hope i still have it. whaddya think of trudi? she ain't got a boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get high?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{which one's trudi? the one with all the shit in her face?}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{no, that's jody. that's my wife.}
<A>__{vincent and lance giggle at the "faux pas."}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i'm on my way somewhere. i got a dinner engagement. rain check?}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{no problem?}
