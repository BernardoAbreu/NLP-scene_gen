<L>__{interior chris' truck afternoon}
<A>__{sam sits in the passenger side of chris' truck and cries and cries. major emotional release. chris looks like he wants to say something, but doesn't have the words. i e. chris' truck motel evening chris and sam pull up to the motel in his pick up. they've gone to get her prescription filled, and sam has the bottle of pills in her hand.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i'm really sorry, sam.}
<A>__{she doesn't respond.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{it's horrible... but sometimes these things can happen for a reason. sometimes good can come of it... growth, ya know?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what the fuck are you talking about?}
<A>__{sam's benumbed expression doesn't change, but her tone is caustic.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{all i meant was, sometimes }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i know what you meant, and it's bullshit. when someone dies for no reason you can't just make one up to fill the void and make yourself feel better. it sucks, and it fucks everything up, but it doesn't mean shit beyond that.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you've obviously never lost anybody like i have, `cause if you did you'd already know that.}
<A>__{chris doesn't try anymore. sam immediately feels bad.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{thanks for the ride.}
<A>__{she gets out of the car and slogs toward her room.}
