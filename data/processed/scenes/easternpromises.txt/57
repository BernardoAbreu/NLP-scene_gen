<D>__{anna exits, pulling on her coat against the cold. she stops in her tracks when she sees her unchained motorbike parked in the parking bay. she hears nikolai's voice over her shoulder.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i thought i'd bring it back before it got stolen. lot of villains around. sorry about the chain. anna is about to walk quickly away...}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{i got that address you wanted. anna turns and sees nikolai is offering a scrap of paper.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{a little village outside st. petersburg. i know it. not much of a place for a kid to grow up in. especially not a girl. she hesitates. nikolai approaches and gives her the address.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{if you want my opinion, the kid would be better off in london. maybe with you. why not? tatiana's family don't sound like the kind of people who'd want another mouth to feed. a pause.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you read the diary? nikolai looks all around. anna studies him, unsure.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{so how can you keep doing what you're doing?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i told you. i'm just a driver. anna sees some softness in his expression. their eyes lock.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you look the other way.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i'm a camera. the pictures stay in my head. anna sees pain in his eyes. she peers at the address.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{why did you bring me this?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i don't know. i was passing. after a long moment anna turns away.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{oh, and... your uncle. nikolai smiles.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{is it true he was in the kgb?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{well, he's a brave old man. that's for sure. a pause.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{does he live with you? anna is about to answer but stops herself. nikolai peers at her and finally shrugs then turns to walk away. he gestures at the bike.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{i fixed it. it should be ok now. anna watches him walk away into the street.}
