<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior mr. gumb's basement day (dimly lit)}
<A>__{close on scraps of food peas, chicken bones lying on the cement floor of the pit, near the foil tray of a tv dinner.}
<C>__{catherine }
<P>__{(muttering, feisty)}
<D>__{close enough to fuck is close enough to fight...}
<B>__{catherine}
<A>__{is hunched over in concentration. the plastic toilet bucket is on her lap, and she has yanked down its cotton string.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{get my legs round your neck, you goddamn creep, i will send you home to jesus...}
<B>__{her fingers}
<A>__{are tying a chicken bone to the bucket's handle, where it meets the string. the other end of the string is tied to her wrist.}
<B>__{she stands}
<A>__{gathers the coiled string in one hand, and swings the bucket by its handle, calculating this distance up to the basement floor.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{okay, precious. time for a treat...}
<A>__{she hurls the bucket upwards.}
<B>__{at the lip of the oubliette}
<A>__{the bucket sails out, bounces loudly, then falls back inside. angle on the dog, precious who is elsewhere in the basement, worrying a toy. she cocks an ear, making a low growl, then sets off to investigate.}
<B>__{down in the pit}
<A>__{catherine swings the bucket again, trying another cast.}
<B>__{the bucket lands}
<A>__{two feet beyond the pit's edge, rolls a bit, stops.}
<B>__{precious trots up}
<A>__{then pauses, staring curiously towards... very low angle (dog's pov) the enticing chicken bone, six feet away. it twitches as catherine tugs on the string, edging the bucket back towards the pit. precious with her tail wagging, barks greedy but suspicious.}
<B>__{catherine}
<A>__{staring upwards, pulls again, even so gently, at the string.}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{preeeeecious...! c'mon, boy, nice yummy bone... c'mon, you little shit...}
<B>__{precious}
<A>__{edges reluctantly closer... then suddenly rushes in, seizing the bone in her teeth. she tries to run away with it, but catherine is pulling her towards the hole, working her like a hooked fish. her toenails scrabble as she tries to stop.}
<B>__{catherine}
<A>__{stares desperately, unable to see how she's doing.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{hang on, boy... hang on...}
<B>__{precious}
<A>__{still fights for the bone, growling, as the bucket rocks precariously on the edge of the pit. a long, seesaw battle... until finally, when one of her forelegs slips momentarily into the hole, she panics and lets go. the bucket flops over the edge.}
<B>__{catherine}
<A>__{crouches, covering her head as the bucket bounces off her.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{nooooo...!}
<B>__{the little dog}
<A>__{furious, barks down at her, then trots away in disgust.}
<B>__{close on catherine}
<A>__{as she sinks to the cold cement. she slaps aside the foil tray, the scraps of food, sobbing in utter despair...}
