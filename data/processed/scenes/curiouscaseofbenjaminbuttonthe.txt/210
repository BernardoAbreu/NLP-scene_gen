<A>__{they look at each other in silence...and they simply smile, so glad to see each other after all the missing years... they embrace...for some time... and kiss... as people who haven't seen each other, and have thought about each other... for a very long time... and it just is...no big symphonies, no endless skies...just, two people at a kitchen door in the middle of their lives... and the simplicity, just that, is what makes it real and breaks your heart.}
