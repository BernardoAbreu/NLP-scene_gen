<L>__{exterior flanders field day}
<A>__{joey walks out onto the world war one battlefield of her most recent dream. she stands there an incongruous vulnerable figure in her nightdress and robe amidst the corpses, the trenches, and the distant plumes of smoke.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{what's going on? is this a dream?}
<A>__{she glances back at the door of the hut she has just left. joey's pov through hut door within the hut, the frozen elliott still sits.}
<B>__{angle on joey}
<A>__{ as she turns from looking into the hut and gasps, her eyes wide in shock. standing on a hillock, framed against the grey battlefield skies, is elliott. joey walks toward him. elliott stands calmly and smiles at joey.}
<C>__{elliott}
<D>__{joey. how kind of you to come.}
<A>__{a beat. joey (and the audience) take in elliott's impossible presence, as she and he stand amidst the corpse strewn field.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{wait ... wait. you ... you have to help me. i don't understand. am i dreaming this?}
<C>__{elliott}
<D>__{you have to help me. you will understand. and no, you're not dreaming. do you know where we are?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{it's ... i don't know. first world war, right?}
<C>__{elliott}
<D>__{correct. the fields of france. and many dead flowers ... oh. forgive me. my name was spenser. elliott spenser. captain.}
<A>__{he extends his hand. joey slowly and nervously puts her hand out to shake his.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{joey summerskill.}
<A>__{elliott smiles understandingly as he releases her hand.}
<C>__{elliott}
<D>__{well done. brave girl. you've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am i right?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{captain spenser. elliott. i ... what the hell is going on?}
<C>__{elliott}
<D>__{hell is precisely what is going on, joey. and we have to stop it. i because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. and because you know what is right, and just, and true. will you walk with me a while?}
<A>__{he gestures with his hand and they begin to walk.}
<C>__{elliott}
<D>__{there were days in this war, days right on top of each other, when the newly dead were numbered in the tens of thousands. they called it the war to end all wars. though it didn't. you know that. there were more wars. more dead. your father's war. your dream search for your father led you here. to me. joey, we need to talk.}
<A>__{elliott does nothing dramatic he doesn't clap his hands or snap his fingers but somehow, magically, he and joey, without moving or changing position are back in the quonset hut.}
