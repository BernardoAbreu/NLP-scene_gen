<L>__{interior day. thornfield the third floor.}
<A>__{the tapestried room. rochester glances at mason. he unlocks the inner door with one hand; the other won't let go of jane. grace poole sits by a strongly guarded fire, stirring something in a pot. rochester leads jane and the men into the room. there is no window, no furniture except for grace's chair; only a mattress on the floor.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{sir, you can't be bringing folk in here. it's madness.}
<A>__{bertha antoinetta mason stands, amazed at the sight of her visitors. she wears a white shift. there are black rook feathers twined in her hair; her only ornament.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{this clothed hyena is my wife.}
<A>__{bertha's pose is dignified, her expression grows triumphant. she approaches rochester her eyes locked with jane's. jane gazes: fear, disgust, compassion.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{i was duped into marriage with this lunatic fifteen years ago.}
<A>__{briggs and wood are deeply repelled.}
<C>__{wood}
<D>__{let us go. we have seen enough.}
<A>__{bertha puts her arm through rochester's; lays her head on his shoulder; smiles at jane, magnanimous in her victory.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{my own demon, bertha.}
<A>__{with shocking speed and strength bertha lays her nails into rochester's cheek. he struggles with her. grace assists rochester. they do not hit; they subdue. bertha's attack is effectively contained. they have her on her knees, her arms behind her. bertha lifts her head and screams. if a scream could express the agony of a whole soul then this would. jane turns on her heels. she stumbles, finds the door, exits.}
