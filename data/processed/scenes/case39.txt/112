<L>__{interior emily's house day}
<A>__{emily unplugs the phone in the kitchen. unplugs the one by the sofa. opens the closet and tosses the phones inside with the banker's boxes she put there. closes the door. locks it. hides the key. just then, a flashing red light draws her gaze to the window }
<B>__{a school bus}
<A>__{stopping at the end of the block. emily crosses to the window, watching as}
<C>__{lucy}
<A>__{gets off and comes up the sidewalk toward the house. sensing emily's stare, she stops and meets it. waves, testing the waters. emily waves back but it's a hollow gesture. lucy's smile fades, knowing this as she continues toward the house. in a sudden panic emily goes into the kitchen, grabs one of the knives. eyes the blade, forced to contemplate the unthinkable its use as a weapon, self defense. she comes into the living room, holding it. catches sight of herself in the mirror. a jarring image: sweet emily jennings with a butcher's knife in her hand. the sound of lucy's footsteps on the front steps breaks the spell. emily hides the knife behind the fish tank. no good, you can see it through the glass. we hear lucy's key in the lock. emily grabs the knife. it's in her hand as the door clicks open, until the last second when she tosses it under a sofa pillow. lucy enters. shy. innocent. a ten year old home from school.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{emily returns a plastic smile.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{you weren't there so i took the bus.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{sorry, work lost track of time.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{it's okay, i know how busy you are.}
<A>__{emily watches unnerved as lucy crosses to the sofa, to the very pillow where she hid the butcher's knife, and sits down to untie her shoes. the point of the knife is almost touching her leg. if she moves at all, it will cut the skin.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{doesn't matter anyway, the bus stops right at the end of the street. so i can always get home, whether you're there or not.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{lucky.}
<A>__{lucy nods then pauses and looks at the pillow, or appears to, but she is actually looking at the end table.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{where's the phone?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{oh, it wasn't working...}
<A>__{lucy nods oh. finishes untying her shoes then gets up and walks into the kitchen, checks the wall, turns to emily.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{wow. that one, too.}
<A>__{emily, caught in a lie, says nothing.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{can i have a shower? we had gym today...}
<A>__{emily nods. lucy heads into the bathroom. pauses at the door, back turned.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{are they being nice to her?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{my mother.}
<A>__{she turns for emily's reaction.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{how how would i know that?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i thought you said you were going to see her.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i never said that.}
<A>__{lucy frowns. a bewilderment that seems genuine.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{hm. i must have dreamt it.}
<A>__{goes into the bathroom. closes the door.}
