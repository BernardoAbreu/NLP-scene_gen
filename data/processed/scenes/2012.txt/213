<A>__{we finally reveal the unbelievable magnitude of this ship yard, built into the hollow belly of the mountains. nine gargantuan vessels are lined up next to each other. their size is at least four times that of the `freedom of the seas'. however, they look more like spaceships than anything, having been built aerodynamically to withstand the full force of nature. but only three of these monstrous arks are complete. number 4 is being repaired, all the others are still under construction, surrounded by scaffolding. suddenly sirens goes off! the boarding bridges to the finished vessels begin to retract. there's growing confusion among the thousands of workers and security personnel.}
