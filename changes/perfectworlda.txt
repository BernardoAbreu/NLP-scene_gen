CLOSEUP - PAIR OF EYES to squint, then adjust to the light and finally open.    They look tired, but content, maybe even relaxed. CLOSEUP - MAN the owner of the eyes. Though we only see from his shoulders to the top of his head, we can tell he's lying in a field. His arm is propped behind his head as a pillow and he appears to be resting comfortably. MUFFLED VOICES and WHISPERS fill the air but they seem to come from another place. The man doesn't notice them. His name is BUTCH. A gust of wind blows Butch's hair a bit and a piece of straw wipes across his forehead. Then, oddly enough, it is followed by a dollar bill, which rests against his cheek, then skitters across his face. It is followed by another and another, a five, a ten, a single. Butch pays no attention. He's in another world.}
