<L>__{ext wagon train camp morning}
<A>__{next morning. doc gallops into camp with mcmasters, texas jack vermillion, and turkey creek jack johnson, exchanging greetings with wyatt who leads him over to the center of the camp, then:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{know why you're here?}
<C>__{vermillion}
<D>__{way ahead of you, wyatt. you want us to help you get ike clanton and johnny behan. everybody knows they're the ones to blame for your brothers.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{they're nothing. they're nobody. i want the cowboys. all of 'em. i mean to break 'em up, drive 'em out of the territory.}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{are you out of your mind? what on earth'd make us }
<C>__{wyatt}
<P>__{(takes out wad of bills)}
<D>__{i will pay you 500 each in advance and i will mount you on those.}
<A>__{he points to his 5 magnificent blacks tied nearby. they look them over as wyatt takes out a stack of warrants.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{got a sheaf of federal warrants. being in the territories it's up to our discretion how they're served. that means we got the cowboys without quarter. the black flag, brother. no prisoners, no mercy, amen.}
<C>__{vermillion}
<P>__{(to johnson)}
<D>__{500... year's wages. and i never even saw a horse like that.}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{you crazy? it can't be done.}
<C>__{mcmasters}
<D>__{it might be done. if we hit the waterholes through the southern dragoons, the whetstones and huachucas, we could take 'em on in pieces, run off their herds.}
<P>__{(faces wyatt)}
<D>__{keep your money, i will show you where those waterholes are. just promise me you'll finish it. no matter what happens you'll see it through to the end. i will have your hand on that.}
<A>__{they shake. vermillion and johnson confer in whispers, then:}
<C>__{vermillion}
<D>__{we come through this in one piece, can we keep the horses?}
<A>__{wyatt nods. vermillion nods to johnson who crouches down with a pair of dice. he makes one pass, two passes... finally:}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{crapped out. okay, we're in.}
<A>__{exp wagon train camp desert day the thoroughbreds are saddled and waiting, each with a rifle in a scabbard and a double barreled shotgun across the saddle fork. lucinda's son looks on with gathering awe as wyatt's men, each carrying 2 pistols, face their boss.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{the minute we start we'll be going against local and county law. if we fail the u.s. government won't be able to lift a finger to help us. nevertheless i want you to understand we carry the full force and authority of the law of this land.}
<A>__{they exchange glances, each man feeling a little shiver at the magnitude of what they're about to attempt. wyatt faces them:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{raise your right hands. do you solemnly swear to uphold the laws and constitution of the united states of america and to protect her citizens to the best of your ability, even at the cost of your own life?}
<A>__{all chorus, "i do", except for doc who rolls his eyes. finally:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{oh... all right.}
<A>__{wyatt hands each a federal deputy's badges. doc waves his away:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you know why i'm here. my hypocrisy only goes so far.}
<A>__{wyatt shrugs. they mount up, about to begin, but suddenly:}
<C>__{lucinda}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{lucinda runs up to wyatt, reaching up and tying a blue and gold silk scarf around his neck.}
<C>__{lucinda}
<D>__{your colors.}
<A>__{wyatt nods his surprised thanks as the wagonmaster steps up:}
<C>__{wagonmaster}
<D>__{good luck, boys. and give 'em hell!}
<A>__{they shake hands then wyatt motions to his men. they take off at a graceful lope, riding through camp toward the deadfall and the desert beyond. unable to contain himself any longer, lucinda's son bounds up onto a wagon, waving and shouting, spurring them on with a spontaneous frontier toast:}
<C>__{lucinda's son}
<D>__{wyatt earp, the two gun man, whistling death and bloody murder! wyatt the widow maker, avenging and bright, purple poison on horseback with lightning in his eye and thunder in his heart! wyatt and his he devils, holy terrors and true, five black centaurs blowin' fire and quicksilver! ride out and charge and shoot and strike and cleave and hack and thrust home! don't let up and give no rest and never call retreat till the last one's smashed and smote and runnin' for cover. best 'em all and break 'em up and bang their heads together in a bunch and give no quarter though they be ten times ten thousand!}
<A>__{wyatt turns in the saddle, sweeping off his hat with a cavalier's flourish as he and his men take the deadfall in a single bound and pass into the desert. an immigrant father grabs his infant son, lifting him up.}
<C>__{illinois mother}
<D>__{what're you doing?}
<C>__{illinois father}
<D>__{someday he'll be able to say he was there when wyatt earp rode out to bring the law.}
<A>__{music up, avenging and bright, as wyatt and his men ride through the desert, 5 abreast on their giant chargers, glossy black coats shimmering in the sunlight, hoofbeats pounding in unison.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{all right, let's wring 'em out!}
<A>__{they break into a dead run, streaking across the frame. as they crest a rise the ground seems to drop from under them and for a single perfect moment it appears as if they're airborne, flying across the skyline like the winged horsemen of myth. johnson turns to vermillion, laughing at the sheer joy of being alive:}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{like flyin', son. just like flyin'.}
