<L>__{interior executive waiting room day}
<A>__{the room is very posh, with fancy paneling and marble floors. ed sits nervously under posters for "grand hotel" and "quo vadis." film cans labled "glen or glenda" rest in his lap.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{sir, mr. feldman will see you now.}
<A>__{she hits an electric button. a large oak door swings open.}
<L>__{interior office}
<A>__{behind a giant desk is mr. feldman, a glib, thin over caffeinated man. he jumps up, smiling.}
<C>__{mr. feldman}
<D>__{mr. ward, it's a delight to meet you.}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(shaking his hand)}
<D>__{it's wood. ed wood.}
<C>__{mr. feldman}
<D>__{wood? ward? wood.}
<P>__{(puzzled, he glances at his appointment book)}
<D>__{hey, what do you know. it is wood. dang secretaries, you can never get a good one. right?}
<A>__{ed shrugs. feldman grins.}
<C>__{mr. feldman}
<D>__{so what are you bringing me? looks like you got some film cans.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{well, mr. feldman, some people have resumes to show. i've got my own movie.}
<C>__{mr. feldman}
<D>__{really?! well good for you.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i just made this picture, over at screen classics. it opens next week.}
<C>__{mr. feldman}
<D>__{screen classics? hmm, don't know them.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{nobody in town has seen it, so i'm givin' you first crack at my talents.}
<C>__{mr. feldman}
<D>__{i can't wait to take a look.}
<P>__{(he claps his hands)}
<D>__{so what's up next?}
<A>__{ed leans in.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{well, mr. feldman, i don't believe in thinking small. so i've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "the vampire's tomb," "the ghoul goes west"... and "doctor acula"!}
<C>__{mr. feldman}
<D>__{doctor acula? i don't get it. ed dr. acula !}
<A>__{ed writes it out, "dr. acula," then waves it in feldman's face. feldman nods.}
<C>__{mr. feldman}
<D>__{oh, "dr. acula." i get it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't like it.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{but bela lugosi's in it!}
<C>__{mr. feldman}
<D>__{lugosi's washed up. what else you got?}
<A>__{ed grimaces. lugosi was 90% of his pitch. he vamps.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{well... i've got another project i wasn't gonna tell you about. lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part. the lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named dolores fuller. the title is "bride of the atom."}
<C>__{mr. feldman}
<D>__{ah! atomic age stuff, huh? i like it.}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{i will tell you what, mr. ward. why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and i will take a look at your little opus. maybe we can do business together.}
<A>__{ed is elated.}
