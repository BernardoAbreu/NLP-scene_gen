<L>__{interior mozart's living room day 1780's}
<A>__{a cramped, low ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied for ages. we see music lying everywhere. also there are many empty wine bottles; musical instruments among them a mandolin, a viola, a forte piano with the black and white keys reversed books and abandoned plates of food. mozart clasps his father's arms. leopold is now seen as an aging, travel stained man in clothes that need repair. his face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{why are you here?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{am i not welcome?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{of course, welcome! welcome ten thousand times. papa! my papa!}
<A>__{he kisses his hands.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you're very thin. does she not feed you, this wife of yours?}
<A>__{mozart ducks away and fetches his father's bags from the landing.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{feed? well, of course she feeds me. she stuffs me like a goose all day long. she's the best cook in the world. i mean, since mama. just wait, you'll see.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{is she not here?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{i don't know. stanzi? stanzi!}
<A>__{leopold looks about him at the mess in the room.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{do you always live like this?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{oh, yes. oh, i mean no not exactly like this. i mean today just today, stanzi i remember now. she had to go yes! she had to help her mother. yes, she's like that. her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.}
<A>__{he carries the bag across the room and opens the door of the bedroom. constanze lies in bed. she sits up, startled.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{oh! i didn't know you were home. stanzi, this is my father.}
<A>__{constanze, who looks ill and tired, stares at leopold. leopold stares back from the doorway.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{we'll wait, we'll wait. why don't you get up now, darling?}
<A>__{he closes the door again.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{she's very tired, poor creature. you know me: i'm a real pig. it's not so easy cleaning up after me.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{don't you have a maid?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{oh we could, if we wanted to, but stanzi won't hear of it. she wants to do everything herself.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{how is your financial situation?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{it couldn't be better.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{that's not what i hear.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{what do you mean? it's wonderful. really, it's it's marvelous! people love me here.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{they say you're in debt.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{who? who says that? now that's a malicious lie!}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{how many pupils do you have?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{pupils?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{i don't know. it's not important. i mean, i don't want pupils. they get in the way. i've got to have time for composition.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{composition doesn't pay. you know that.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{this one will.}
<A>__{he picks up some pages of manuscript.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{oh, let's not talk about it.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{it's a secret.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you don't have secrets from me.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{it's too dangerous, papa. but they're going to love it. ah, there she is!}
<A>__{constanze comes into the room. she is wearing a dressing gown and has made a perfunctory attempt to tidy her hair. we see that she is clearly pregnant.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{my stanzi look at her! isn't she beautiful? come on now, confess, papa. could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{stop it, wolfi. i look dreadful. welcome to our house, herr mozart.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{he's not herr mozart. call him papa.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i see that you're expecting.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{oh, yes.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{when, may i ask?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{in three months! papa.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{isn't that marvelous? we're delighted.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{why didn't you mention it in your letters?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{didn't i? i thought i did. i'm sure i did.}
<A>__{he gives a little giggle of embarrassment.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{may i offer you some tea, herr mozart?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{tea? who wants tea? let's go out! this calls for a feast. you don't want tea, papa. let's go dancing. papa loves parties, don't you?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{wolfi!}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{what? how can you be so boring? tea!}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{wolfi, i think your father's tired. i will cook us something here.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{thank you. that'll be fine. don't spend any money on me.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{why not? oh, come, papa! what better way could i spend it than on you? my kissable, missable, suddenly visible papa!}
<A>__{the jaunty tune of ich mochte wohl der kaiser sein (k.539) sounds through all the following. this is an alternate song from il seraglio: a very extroverted tune for baritone and orchestra and a prominent part for bass drum. the vocal part should be arranged for trumpet.}
