<A>__{jimmy looks bad. sprawled out on a tangle of dirty sheets. jeans. bare feet. smoking. staring at a football card. a duplicate of the one darian showed him. he swings his legs off the bed. stands, crushes out his cigarette. moves into the bathroom. the baggie of coke is on the counter. he stares at it with bloodshot eyes. swallows hard. acts before he can think. grabs the baggie. tosses it in the toilet. flushes. watches as it goes down the drain.}
