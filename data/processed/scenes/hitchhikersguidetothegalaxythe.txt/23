<L>__{interior hold of vogon constructor ship night}
<A>__{arthur, in total shock, holds up the guide.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so you're not from guilford, which would explain the accent which i've always wondered about...and you're not an out of work actor but rather a writer for this...this...book thing.}
<A>__{ford nods. arthur rubs his weary brow.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{i don't feel well. i need a cup of tea.}
<A>__{ford hands him a fistful of peanuts.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{here. eat these. if you've never been through a transmat beam before you've probably lost some salt and protein.}
<A>__{arthur eats some peanuts, sits up, squints. ford feels his way around the room, looking for something.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{if i asked where we were would i regret}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{we're safe. for now.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{we're in a storage hold in one of the ships of the vogon constructor fleet ...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{obviously some strange usage of the word safe i wasn't previously aware of.}
<C>__{ford}
<P>__{(not getting the sarcasm)}
<D>__{is it?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{tell me you're joking.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{okay. i'm joking.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{and do a reassuring little laugh.}
<A>__{ford does a reassuring little laugh.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{now tell me where we really are.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{in the storage hold of a vogon constructor ship.}
<A>__{ford continues his search. arthur's breathing quickens.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{get me home. ford.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{home? arthur...your home... is...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{oh god it was demolished! i've got to reach my lawyer! he must be back from lunch by now...}
<A>__{he pulls out his cell phone. desperately punches numbers. ford flips on a light switch, revealing a messy chamber full of alien junk and old mattresses.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{you don't remember, do you?}
<P>__{(taking his cell phone)}
<D>__{okay. i've got something to tell you. it ain't gonna be easy, but you're gonna have to just deal, okay?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{good god. is this really the interior of a flying saucer?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{yeah. why?}
<A>__{shot: deep space. the vogon fleet in flight}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{well, it's a bit squalid isn't it?}
<C>__{ford }
<D>__{hey man, you're in denial.}
