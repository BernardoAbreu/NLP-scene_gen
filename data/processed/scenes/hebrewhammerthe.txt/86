<L>__{exterior israeli highway late afternoon}
<A>__{the hammer is moments away from the j.a.c. compound. he spots the motorcycle ramp, and then guns his engine. he's close!}
<L>__{interior jewish atomic clock continuous}
<A>__{inside, santa and his thugs hear the sound of the chopper growing in strength. the roar of the engines is piercingly loud! and then nothing. a beat passes, and then the hammer's motorcycle busts open the front door. an insert of the hammer's bike skidding to a stop. as santa goes for his gun, the hammer interrupts him...}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{uh. can you just give me one second?}
<A>__{santa is confused. still on the bike, the hammer uses his feet to backpeddle the motorcycle to the doorway. looks of bewilderment from santa and his gang. the hammer reaches the doorway and kisses his hand. a john wooish slo mo shot as the hammer touches his hand to the mezuzah nailed to the doorframe. the hammer jumps off the bike, and we get the requisite quick push in on him as he pulls out two uzi's from under his jacket.}
<C>__{hammer }
<D>__{let's dance the hora!}
<A>__{santa draws a pistol, and with a single shot from his uzi, the hammer blows it out of his hand. it lands on the other side of the room. santa looks up from his empty hand.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{get him boys!}
<A>__{santa's elf thugs open a chest filled with large sub machine guns. the chest is labeled "heavy artillery." with great difficulty, they struggle to pull the heavy machinery out of the box. the hammer, mildly amused, watches them. the hammer blasts away, and the elves scramble for safety. the sound of gunfire is deafening and constant. an elf sneaks quietly towards santa's gun. esther walks in through the front door and spots something o.s. that gives her cause for concern. unbeknownst to the hammer, the sneaky elf picks up santa's gun. he raises it at the hammer, ready to fire.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{mordechai! behind you!}
<A>__{the hammer turns and nails the elf just in time. esther, gun drawn, backs up into frame with the hammer, and the two fire off rounds.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{mordechai, i love you. i couldn't let you do this alone.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{i love you too. i'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. i was wrong.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{i forgive you.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{go check on the clock. i will finish up here.}
<A>__{we do another quick push into the hammer as he turns towards tiny tim. tiny tim, standing alone with his crutches tucked under his arms, looks like a deer caught in headlights. the hammer grins mischievously.}
<C>__{tiny tim}
<D>__{uh oh.}
<A>__{the hammer begins firing. in slow motion, tiny tim hobbles as fast as he can towards an overturned table, gunfire trailing him. like a pole vaulter with two poles, tiny tim plants his crutches firmly into the ground and launches himself over the table. he lands directly on top of santa, who cowers underneath the table.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{get off of me you cripple!}
<C>__{tiny tim}
<D>__{what are we gonna do? he's got us on the ropes.}
<A>__{we dolly back with the hammer as he approaches the camera, firing rounds at the table. we cut to the duct taped hasidic guards tied to their chairs. one of them frantically nudges the other and motions to the window. fear fills both of their eyes. we see what they see. through the window, the sun is quickly setting behind the mountains. we cut back to the hammer. the speed with which he shoots begins to slow. esther, checking the clock for damage calls to him.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm feeling kind of tired.}
<A>__{we cut back to santa and tiny tim underneath the table. we hear the shooting continue to slow, until finally it ceases altogether. santa and tiny tim exchange looks.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{what's going on? why'd he stop?}
<C>__{tiny tim}
<D>__{maybe he ran out of ammo.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{take a look.}
<A>__{tiny tim pokes his head over the table to see... the hammer and esther lie together slumped up against the wall. they look exhausted. tiny tim drops back below the table.}
<C>__{tiny tim}
<D>__{well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{resting?}
<A>__{he thinks for a second. an idea forms.}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{what day is it?}
<C>__{tiny tim}
<D>__{it's friday.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{tiny tim}
<D>__{i don't know. about sundown i guess.}
<A>__{santa makes the connection.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{why didn't i think of this? it's the sabbath.}
<A>__{a blank look from tiny tim.}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{the day of rest. he can't fight on the sabbath. c'mon, get up. we've got him beat.}
<A>__{the hammer's pov as santa and his thugs approach him cautiously.}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{well, well, well. it looks as if the hebrew hammer's got a weakness after all.}
<A>__{santa turns to his thugs.}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{finish extracting the judeum from the clock.}
<P>__{(to tiny tim)}
<D>__{tiny tim, i want you to introduce the hebrew hammer to the christmas spirit.}
<A>__{another blank look from tiny tim.}
<C>__{tiny tim}
<D>__{you want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{no dipshit, i want you to kill him.}
<A>__{he thinks about it.}
<C>__{tiny tim}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{santa's gonna take the sled back to the north pole and celebrate his victory with his new stocking stuffer.}
<A>__{santa grabs esther and attempts to pull her up. the hammer holds on tightly to her other hand, but isn't strong enough to resist santa's might. esther's hand is pulled from his firm grip, and santa takes her into his arms.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{esther!}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{mordechai!}
<A>__{santa forces her out the front door, leaving tiny tim alone with the hammer. o.s., we hear the sound of santa's sled taking off.}
<C>__{tiny tim}
<D>__{take a look hammer. the clock's already beginning to power down.}
<A>__{we see a shot of the elves pumping out the judeum from the clock, and then tilt up to reveal its face. the dial slowly spins past 'yom kippur', 'passover', 'hanukkah,' 'purim', and then finally the 'macy's 50% off spring sale.' tiny tim raises his gun point blank at the hammer.}
<C>__{tiny tim }
<D>__{ah. what's the matter? no more snappy one liners.}
<A>__{it seems all is lost when... we hear the sounds of a whole lot of guns being cocked. tiny tim turns around to see the entire kwanzaa liberation front with their guns raised at him. jamal, standing next to mohammed, flashes tiny tim a smile.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{merry kwanzaa nigga!}
