<L>__{interior dalai lama's private rooms day}
<A>__{in the room immediately adjacent to this bedroom, we now see the three monks who chased the young boy down the slippery halls. they are the dalai lama's personal attendants the master of the ritual, the master of the kitchen, and the master of the robe. (it is the master of the kitchen who stands directly behind the curtain.) the lord chamberlain is also there. he is a monk. a tall, angular man, with almost nordic features: large, round eyes, a yellowish mustache, sharp nose. all of these men will become quite familiar to us, as will the man standing, listening, behind the attendants. he is a sweeper, a man named norbu thundrup, age thirty. he is tall, and gangly, with a wispy beard and a pock marked face.}
