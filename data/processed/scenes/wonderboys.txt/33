<L>__{interior dancefloor moments later}
<A>__{grady and hannah, reflected in bits and pieces in the jack 'o lantern wail of mirrored tile, slow dance to a sexy, measured blues.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{i've been re reading arsonist's daughter. it's so beautiful, grady. so natural. it's like ail your sentences always existed, just waiting around in style heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i thank you.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{and i love the inscription you wrote to me. only i'm not quite the downy innocent you think i am.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i hope that isn't true. we need all the downy innocents we can get.}
<A>__{grady spies the corner table, watches crabtree say something to q and then, casually, stroke a lock of hair from james leer's forehead.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{so what are you going to do?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{do?}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{i just mean, i i guess emily isn't going to be there when you get home.}
<A>__{grady looks down into hannah's translucent face, then catches a glimpse of himself in the fractured, wail. the tile that would reflect his head is missing.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{are you holding me up or am i dragging you down?}
<A>__{hannah snuggles closer, lays her head on grady's chest.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{shush.}
