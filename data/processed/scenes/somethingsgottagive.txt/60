<A>__{harry sits up in bed, staring at his laptop, wearing erica's glasses, a pair of pajamas and a three day growth. a thermometer is propped in his mouth. he writes: r u there? she answers: yes. hello. he writes: how are ya? she writes: great... as, she wipes her tears on her sleeve. he writes:how's the writing going? she answers: pouring out of me now. go figure. he types: i miss y .. he stops, thinks before sending. erica waits on her side. nothing, is coming over. then, on his side, he receives: actually just running out. take care... harry deletes the i miss y... and instead writes: u 2. erica slides down in her bed, wiped.}
