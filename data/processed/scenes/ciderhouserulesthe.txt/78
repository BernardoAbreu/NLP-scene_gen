<L>__{exterior cider house dusk}
<A>__{homer and wally get out of the jeep at the cider house, a barnlike building with adjacent sheds and, behind it, line after line of trees the apple orchards. homer sees an outdoor shower where three black men are showering. it is a wooden stall that leaves the shower's occupants visible above and below their midsections. a fourth black man is caught naked, running behind the cider house and out of sight as he wraps a towel around himself.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you already used up the hot water!}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{you're usin' my soap, ain't you?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i ain't usin' no soap it's too cold to bother with soap!}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{there ain't never enough hot water, soap or no soap.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{they're migrants.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(no clue)}
<D>__{migrants?}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{yes. they pick fruit, all kinds. they travel up and down the coast with the seasons.}
<P>__{(leaning close to homer)}
<D>__{the trick to mr. rose is, you have to let him be the boss.}
<A>__{homer wonders what that means as wally reaches for the door of the cider house. before wally can knock, a pretty young black girl, rose rose, bumps open the screen door with her hip and throws a bucket of water in the grass almost hitting homer and wally.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{that sink's backed up again, wally. i thought you was gonna get me a plumber.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{rose, this is homer homer, this is mr. rose's daughter, rose.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{rose rose?}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{pretty, ain't it? you a plumber?}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{no, no homer is a new picker. he's going to stay here with you.}
<A>__{this gets the attention of the men on their way from the showers. they walk over, towels around their waists.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<P>__{(suspiciously)}
<D>__{he's stayin' here?}
<A>__{the screen door swings open and shut again, startling them all, as mr. rose comes out of the cider house.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{that daughter of mine sure is miss hospitality, ain't she, wally?}
<A>__{grinning, mr. rose shakes wally's hand. rose rose goes back inside the cider house as mr. rose shakes homer's hand. homer introduces himself.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{you got lots of experience pickin', i suppose.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{homer's got no experience, arthur, but he's smarter then i am. he's a fast learner.}
<A>__{mr. rose looks briefly at the men, who wait for his reaction.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{this is history. ain't that what you're sayin', wally? i guess we makin' history... havin' this young man stay with us!}
<A>__{wally slaps homer on the back; he goes inside the cider house to help rose rose with the plumbing.}
<C>__{wally}
<P>__{(over his shoulder)}
<D>__{see you later.}
<A>__{homer looks at mr. rose for instructions. mr. rose stares back at him with his enigmatic smile.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{so. what should i do now?}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{out back, there's a shed. it's just a mess. if that shed was better organized, i could put my truck in there.}
<A>__{homer looks at mr. rose with an uncomprehending expression.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{if you're as smart as wally says, you know you sometimes gotta do one job before you do another.}
<A>__{homer thinks that over. later, homer is cleaning out the shed.}
