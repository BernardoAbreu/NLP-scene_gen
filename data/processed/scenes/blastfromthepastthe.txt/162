<D>__{you dance?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i took a dance lesson everyday of my life until a couple of days ago.}
<C>__{miss sweet}
<D>__{you're kidding!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no, i'm not! my mom taught me.}

<C>__{miss sweet}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{they head for the dance floor. angle troy and eve watching. angle the floor a jitterbug song comes on and so does adam. he and miss sweet are a little rough on take off, but they hit smooth sailing soon enough. he's terrific at picking up the new stuff she shows him. angle eve & troy they are shocked. angle dance floor heather cuts in on miss sweet as the other dancers stop to watch someone who is so much better than them. the three of them begin to dance together. angle troy & eve}

<D>__{you know, he's a very, very good }
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{angle dance floor eve adam dances beautifully with the two women. we cut back: and forth between them and eve. angle dance floor adam, miss sweet and heather complete their dance with great aplomb. other dancers applaud them. someone is whistling loudly off camera. adam and his dance partners look over to: angle eve she is whistling like a guy calling his dog. troy is embarrassed.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{must you...}
<A>__{eve points at adam and beckons broadly for him to come over a basketball coach calling her player off the floor.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{what in the hell is wrong with you?!!}
<A>__{angle dance floor}
<C>__{miss sweet}
<D>__{is that your girl friend?}

<D>__{i will certainly try. and thank you both very much for the dance.}
<A>__{he leaves.}

<D>__{when was the last time you saw manners like that?}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{yeah. it's like meeting a foreigner or something.}
<A>__{angle table as adam comes over. the music is not so loud now.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(to troy)}
<D>__{go to the bathroom.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{right here?}
<P>__{(then, off her look)}
<D>__{well, you're being so bossy i wasn't sure!}
<A>__{troy rises and exits. adam arrives and sits down.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{you wanted to see me!}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you're not from alaska! where'd you learn to dance like that?! and there are no starving people, are there?!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{why are you suddenly so mad at me?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{don't change the subject! i want you to tell me the truth about yourself.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i've never lied to you. i've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but i've never lied.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you think i'm some sort of sap?! don't you?!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no. i admire you. i...i fell in love with you the first time i saw you.}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{i did. i think that you are the most }
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{all right. let me tell you the whole thing. in 1962 }
<C>__{cliff }
<D>__{well, well, well. don't we clean up nice?}
<A>__{cliff steps up to the table. adam, automatically a gentleman, rises and offers his hand.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{hello, cliff, how are you this evening?}
<A>__{cliff barely shakes his hand.}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{not bad.}
<A>__{then he sits in adam's seat.}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{but i do miss that green sport coat of yours.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{thank you very much. but, cliff, that's my seat. and i was just }
<C>__{cliff}
<P>__{(to eve)}
<D>__{how 'bout a drink at the bar?}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(pause, then)}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{they rise. cliff gestures to the chair.}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{it's all yours.}
<A>__{eve and cliff go to the bar. adam sits down glumly. he looks across the room and catches the eye of miss sweet who is seated at a table with heather. a good looking guy is hitting on them. cutting back and forth between adam and them we see miss sweet's smile escalate. then she nudges heather who also looks over and smiles. adam smiles back. finish with a closer shot of his pov of miss sweet's hair, butt and legs. angle bar eve and cliff are in cozy conversation at the bar. jonathan, jason, and sophie are in the bg. angle troy returning from the restroom. he is surprised to see eve at the bar with cliff. when he looks back at the dance floor table, adam is not there. angle eve and cliff sipping wine.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{so where is your roommate, the model?}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{you know, i don't know. and looking at you, i don't care. it's been too long, eve.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{please excuse this interruption.}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{oh, brother...}
<A>__{wider bar adam steps closer, looking past cliff at eve.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{eve, i don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me cliff, but eve, isn't cliff just a butt with hair?}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i'm sorry, and legs. legs, butt and hair. well, isn't he? and shallow, as well?}
<C>__{cliff}
<P>__{(the shallowest guy in the world)}
<D>__{shallow? i'm shallow?!}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{go home, adam. go to your hotel.}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{yeah. before i kick your ass.}
<A>__{he gives adam a shove.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{cliff, i must warn you. i know how to defend myself.}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{do ya?}
<A>__{cliff throws a right which adam calmly blocks and counters with a short right jab to cliff's mouth, snapping his head back. it's not a big punch, but very, very quick. it makes eve mad and astonishes troy, jason and jonathan.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{stop it, you two!}
<C>__{cliff}
<P>__{(slightly insecure)}
<D>__{i guess we shouldn't fight in here.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(lowering his guard)}
<D>__{yes, i agree.}
<A>__{cliff draws back another right. adam flicks out a quick left to cliff's cheek, again snapping his head back, but not his body. (these aren't big movie hits.) cliff takes a beat or two then draws back his right fist again. adam pops him in the nose. cliff drops his right arm to his side.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{adam?!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{cliff}
<P>__{(increasingly insecure)}
<D>__{maybe we shouldn't fight at all. fighting is pretty immature.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(lowering his guard)}
<D>__{it certainly is. i agree with you completely.}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{eve? i'm leaving.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i don't blame you!}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(turning to eve)}
<D>__{eve, i'm sorry.}
<A>__{seeing an opportunity, cliff rears back with another right. adam deftly pops him in the mouth again with a short right jab.}
<C>__{cliff}
<P>__{(deeply insecure)}
<D>__{well, good night, everyone.}
<A>__{troy, jonathan and jason say good night to him. cliff walks unsteadily away bleeding from the mouth and both nostrils. (hopeful that no one has noticed that he's very subtly just gotten the crap beat out of him.)}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i'm leaving, too.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{but, eve, i would }
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{and tomorrow maybe troy will help you out because i quit! this is ridiculous! you're ridiculous! i'm ridiculous!}
<A>__{she exits. adam looks over at troy who shrugs.}
