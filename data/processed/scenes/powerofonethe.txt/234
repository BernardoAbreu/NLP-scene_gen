<A>__{pk is watching a rugby match being played at twilight. the players are a rough, brutal bunch and play their game accordingly. fights continually break out. off a play a fight breaks out. one of the men is kicked unconscious. two of his teammates carry him off the field, dumping his body unceremoniously like a sack of potatoes on the sidelines. they run back as play resumes. pk turns and walks back through the camp.}
