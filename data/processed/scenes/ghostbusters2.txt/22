<A>__{the broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and visitors. dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and enters the museum.}
<L>__{interior museum restoration studio day (later)}
<A>__{we are full frame on a larger than life, full figure portrait of vigo the carpathian, a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an incredibly powerful evil presence. then we pull back to reveal the studio, which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum, lit by large skylights in the ceiling. working on the vigo painting is janosz poha, a youngish art historian and painter, the head of the department, quirky, intense and somewhat creepy. janosz is staring longingly across the room at dana.}
<B>__{dana}
<A>__{she is carefully cleaning a 19th century landscape painting, still preoccupied by the extraordinary near accident with the buggy. janosz watches her for a moment, then comes up behind her and looks over her shoulder.}

<D>__{still working on the turner?}
<A>__{dana jumps, startled by the intrusion.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{oh, yes, i got in a little late this morning, janosz.}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{you know, you are really doing very good work here. i think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{thank you, janosz. i've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, i was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.}
<B>__{vigo painting}
<A>__{at the mention of dana's baby, the figure of vigo miraculously turns his head and looks at dana.}

<A>__{neither of them notice the movement in the painting.}
<C>__{janosz}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{we'll be very sorry to lose you. perhaps i could take you to lunch today?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{actually, i'm not eating lunch today. i have an appointment.}
<P>__{(looks at her watch)}
<D>__{in fact, i'd better go.}
<A>__{she starts gathering up her things.}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{every day i ask you, and every day you've got something else to do. do i have bad breath or something?}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(trying to brush him off)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. perhaps some other time.}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{okay, i will take a raincheck on that.}
<A>__{janosz smiles at her as she exits, then goes back to his easel.}
<C>__{janosz}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{i think she likes me.}
<A>__{he switches on an english language tape and starts practicing the phrases as he resumes working.}
