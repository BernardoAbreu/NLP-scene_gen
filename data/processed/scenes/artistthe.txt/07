<L>__{exterior airplane night}
<D>__{a little later in the night, still at the controls, the man is fighting not to fall asleep. behind him, the women is sleeping, the dog is lying in her arms. suddenly she is awoken by explosions happening close by! pandemonium! the man doesn't understand it either, he tries to pick up altitude, but quickly notices that the explosions are in fact pretty and inoffensive. he consults a calendar dial on the control panel that shows it is july 14th, immediately understands, and bursts into laughter. title card: we've arrived, welcome to france!!! as the music picks up the tune of the marseillaise, the airplane flies away through the exploding fireworks... the words "the end" appear on the screen.}
