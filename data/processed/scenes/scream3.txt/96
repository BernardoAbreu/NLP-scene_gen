<A>__{gale and dewey can't help gazing into each other's eyes. in an instant it almost seems as if a long lost love has been sparked back to life.}
<C>__{dewey}
<P>__{(shaking it off)}
<D>__{let's get this drawer open. if it's locked, there must be something inside he's trying to hide.}

<C>__{gale}
<D>__{shit. that's gonna leave a mark.}
<A>__{gale slides open the drawer, reaches in. she pulls up a manilla folder. dewey shines the light on the folder as gale opens it up and reads what's inside.}

<A>__{dewey and gale look up and scream as the ghost rushes out of the shadows. jennifer bolts for the door. the ghost jams his knife in her back. she lets out a blood curdling death scream, drops to the floor motionless. gale and dewey share a terrified scream. the killer wipes his blade clean, lunges for them.}
<C>__{dewey}
<P>__{(frantic)}
<D>__{gale run!}
<A>__{dewey jumps in the killer's path. the killer winds back, cracks the base of the knife across dewey's skull. dewey drops to the floor unmoving.}
<C>__{gale}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{dewey!}
<A>__{clang! the killer's blade glistens in the moonlight. he charges for gale. gale screams, races out of the office door, slamming it closed on the killer sending him flying onto his back.}
