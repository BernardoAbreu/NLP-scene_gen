<A>__{madmartigan stabs a minion and sends him hurtlin down the wall. then he turns around. five more enemy swordsmen slash at him. madmartigan is amazing: spin nig, lunging, ducking, he takes out one, two, three, four of them with ease. but not the fifth. it's the nockmaar lieutenant. he and madmartigan swordfight. the lieutenant hacks the sword out of madmartigan's hand: it clatters down into the court yeard. madmartigan throws up his arm. the lieutenant's sword clangs against his wrist armor, knocking madmartigan onto his back. with two hands the lieutenant lifts his sword high and goes to kill madmartigan. madmartigan shuts his eyes. but nothing happens. madmartigan opens his eyes. the lieutenant stands there, frozen, staring at him. then falls forward. rolls over madmartigan. and plummets off teh wall. in his place stands sorsha, holding a bloodied sword.}
