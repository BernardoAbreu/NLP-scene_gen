<L>__{exterior the point night}
<A>__{stacy and ron sit in the car, listening to music. the "point" is a natural lookout spot that lovers can "discover." it is behind the baseball field and dugout of ridgemont high school. stacy and ron get out of the car and walk to the baseball dugout.}
<L>__{interior dugout night}
<A>__{they sit side by side. above them, a single light bulb shines a very private fifty watts on things.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{that's a nice shirt.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{thanks. thanks a lot.}
<A>__{silence. they look at each other, look away.}
<C>__{ron }
<D>__{it's very warm out tonight.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{it is. it's very warm. i wonder how long it will last?}
<A>__{ron leans over and kisses stacy lightly on the cheek. stacy sits quietly for a moment, thinking, was that the first move? then she lunges at ron and kisses him square on the mouth. at first surprised, ron then holds her there and kisses her in return. after a time, he breaks away.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{are you really nineteen?}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{yes... i am really nineteen.}
<A>__{they continue making out.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{i think i better take you home.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{what about those other guys you live with?}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{no. i mean back to your home.}
<A>__{but they make no moves in any direction. they continue making out. ron begins unbuttoning her blouse and massaging stacy's breasts. a moment later, he tugs at her pants. awkwardly, she starts to help him. he tilts her backward onto the concrete dugout bench. they kiss feverishly, her hand pulling off her shoes, then her pants. ron goes to work.}
<C>__{ron }
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{is this your first time?}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{stacy's point of view as she feels a man enter her for the first time, we see the graffiti above her:}
