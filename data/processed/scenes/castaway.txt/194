<A>__{chuck's face is sweaty. he looks down at his foot. it is red, swollen, infected. he stands up, tries to put some weight on it. the pain is intense. chuck sticks the scalpel onto some coals to sterilize it. he holds it over his foot, takes a breath, then jabs in into the wound. the pain is intense. chuck passes out.}
