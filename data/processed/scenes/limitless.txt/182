<L>__{interior eddie's study night}
<A>__{thug #2 has found, behind a bureau, a safe. he calls excitedly, in russian, to the other room.}
<L>__{interior eddie's living room night}
<A>__{gennady calls back in russian. then picks up a particularly delicate, yet sharp looking knife.}
<C>__{gennady}
<D>__{this is a waste of my time, you know that? i am getting out of this part of the business... starting import export company. very exciting stuff. a lot on my plate. i need to learn to delegate...}
<A>__{eddie is backed up against a table, which is covered with stuff he's scattered, which includes a butcher block with a knife in it... gennady starts arranging his instruments.}
<C>__{gennady }
<D>__{first, i will cut skin from you, flay you... you stay alive nice long time... then maybe we cut meat from you, steaks... or maybe softer parts... i get inspiration...}
<A>__{he looks up, smiles, to see the effect his words have on eddie.}
<C>__{on eddie}
<A>__{staring back at gennady, hard, a fuck you stare. we can't see behind eddie's back, but we can see the butcher block, and the knife is gone.}
<C>__{gennady}
<A>__{senses something is not right. looks at eddie quizzically.}
<C>__{gennady }
<D>__{what }
<A>__{eddie brings the knife up as hard as he can, right into gennady's stomach. gennady gasps in surprise, chokes, writhes. eddie drives the knife home, harder, grabbing gennady's other hand, which lashes at eddie with the fillet knife... the men fall to the floor in a death struggle. eddie exhausted, off mdt, but determined not to let go. gennady writhes, flails, but doesn't cry out... he's already choking on blood. eyes shocked, surprised. eddie turns the fillet knife back on gennady, slashes at his other arm; blood spurts. but it's not necessary. gennady's eyes are glazing. his gurgling gets quieter. he's quite dead. eddie lies alongside him, panting, arm grazed and welling blood from where gennady's filleting knife slashed him, suddenly weak and exhausted. from the other room comes the brrrrrrr! sound of the drill the boys, oblivious, are hard at work on the safe. eddie tries to get up, then falls back.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{not much of a triumph, was it?}
<A>__{he's got the shakes... no, more of a convulsion... he sinks back to the floor...}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) because i would die here, too.}
<A>__{there is a break in the convulsion. then another one starts.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) only mdt could help me, and the last of it was in this fuck's bloodstream...}
<A>__{gennady's blood wells around gennady's body in a crimson puddle. a puddle that's creeping closer and closer to eddie's face, which is lying, convulsing, on the floor... on eddie's eyes between convulsions, suddenly looking. looking at the blood. it creeps closer to eddie's face. eddie is trying to move, trying to push his face closer to the blood... he's there... and now he turns his face down into the blood. and begins to lap it up.}
