<L>__{exterior rooftop opposing skyscraper day continuous}
<A>__{special agent dana scully is coming out the door leading onto the roof. the door slams shut behind her. she, too, is dressed in an fbi windbreaker. she's dialing her cell phone as she moves around the rooftop looking for something. dialing the number of:}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{mulder it's me }
<C>__{mulder }
<D>__{where are you, scully?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i'm on the roof.}
<C>__{mulder }
<D>__{did you find something?}
<C>__{scully}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{no. i haven't.}
<C>__{mulder }
<D>__{what's wrong, scully?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i've just climbed twelve floors. i'm hot and thirsty and i'm wondering, to be honest, what i'm doing here.}
<C>__{mulder }
<D>__{you're looking for a bomb.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i know that. but the threat was called in for the federal building across the street.}
<C>__{mulder }
<D>__{i think they have that covered.}
<B>__{we are tracking with scully.}
<C>__{scully}
<P>__{(impatience)}
<D>__{mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. the rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. if you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. if we don't act in accordance with that data if you ignore it as we have done the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. lives could be lost }
<A>__{scully, engrossed in her own argument, realizes she's been the only one speaking for the last short while. she stops walking.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{mulder...?}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{what happened to playing a hunch?}
<A>__{scully almost jumps out of her own skin. the voice has come not over the phone, but from two feet away where:}
<B>__{angle to include agent mulder}
<A>__{standing in the shadow of a large air conditioning unit. cracking a trademark sunflower seed between his teeth. clicking his cell phone off. moving out.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{jesus, mulder...}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{the element of surprise, scully. random acts of unpredictability. if we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...}
<A>__{mulder has moved to the edge of the building where he sails his sunflower seeds into the air. dusting his hands off as if lost in a wistful through for just a moment.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{what are we doing up here? it's hotter than hell.}
<A>__{and he's on the move. scully moving to catch up.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{mulder is moving toward the stairs, scully catching him. mulder allowing her to lead him up the steps.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{how's that?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{you've got to quit looking for what isn't there. they've closed the x files. there's procedure to be followed here. protocol.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{what do you say we call in a bomb threat for houston. i think it's free beer night at the astrodome.}
<A>__{scully gives him a look. it's no use. she reaches the door first, grabs the knob but... it won't open. turning to mulder.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{now what?}
<C>__{mulder}
<P>__{(suddenly nervous)}
<D>__{it's locked?}
<A>__{she wiggles the knob again.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{so much for anticipating the unforeseen...}
<A>__{scully squints into the sun, staring at mulder. but he's quick on the draw, and realizes what she's up to. he grabs for the door and... it opens. looking to scully whose hard look of mock scolding has become a smirking smile.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{had you.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{no you didn't.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{oh yeah. had you big time.}
<A>__{and that's how it continues as they re enter the stairwell, the door slamming shut behind them.}
