<L>__{exterior master epps's plantation field day}
<A>__{ august, 1844 with the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are working the field picking cotton. as before they sing a spiritual, the only thing that distracts them from the tedium at hand. but there is no distracting from the heat. we see henry begin to falter before it... and eventually collapse right in the dirt. though the other slaves take note, none move to help him. none dare. from treach rather matter of factly:}
<C>__{treach}
<D>__{get him water.}
<A>__{edward runs to fetch a gourd. he carries it to henry, dumps the water on him, but does not actually give henry}
<B>__{anything to drink.}
<A>__{roused, henry rights himself.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{go'won. git up.}
<A>__{unsteadily, henry lifts himself and goes back to picking cotton. he joins in again with the spiritual, as if the song is all that can keep him going.}
