<A>__{lazarus steers his tractor toward his small home in a sea of lush green kudzu. he kills the engine and looks beyond the nose of his tractor. he lights a cigarette. below the nose is the head of a rose garden with a painted sign under it: rose's roses. laz inhales smoke and exhales hate. the tractor lunges forward, trampling the garden, ripping the flowers to shreds.}
