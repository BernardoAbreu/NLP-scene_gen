<A>__{nardo enters at the top of the stairs, radiating relief. he trots down into the empty basement, toward a floor to ceiling wine rack.}
<C>__{nardo}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{i thought i was dead, man.}
<P>__{(whistles with relief)}
<D>__{i thought i was fucking dead.}
<A>__{he crosses to the wine rack. it's dark, hard to see. he searches for the bottle. suddenly: a metallic sound behind him. nardo turns chi chi testamente, a wiry, pock faced latino, stands in the shadows (it is clear he has been waiting there, hiding) holding a small silencer automatic.}
<C>__{chi chi}
<D>__{you were right, cabron.}
<A>__{one shot between the eyes and nardo crashes backward into the wine rack, eyes wide with shock and bewilderment. chi chi shoots him again; nardo drops like a stone. coolly, professionally, chi chi pumps four more shots into the prone busboy's head. chi chi ejects the clip into his palm, unscrews the silencer, holsters the gun. salvano appears at the top of the stairs. two busboys are behind him. one of them is the young pimp. the busboys hurry down, the pimp scared shitless but playing it macho cool. salvano comes down the stairs. chi chi stands over his work.}
<C>__{salvano}
<P>__{(to busboys)}
<D>__{clean up this mess.}
<C>__{chi chi}
<D>__{who knows who else is talking }
<C>__{salvano}
<D>__{he was a young fool.}
<B>__{back in upstairs dining room}
<A>__{salvano and chi chi emerge from the basement steps and walk toward their booth.}
<C>__{chi chi}
<D>__{we're crazy waiting for this bullshit 'shipment.' let me waste the other fucker now.}
<A>__{salvano puts a hand on chi chi's shoulder.}
<C>__{salvano}
<D>__{be patient. this will be done the way it was planned.}
