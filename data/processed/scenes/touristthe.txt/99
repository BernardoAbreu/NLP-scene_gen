<L>__{exterior venice morning}
<A>__{establishing shots of the city as it comes to life in the winter time. boats are pushed out into the canals... trash is hosed from the cobblestone streets... tables and chairs are set out at sidewalk cafes, waiting for the tourists to come...}
<L>__{interior sitting room, "safe house" morning}
<A>__{with an unfamiliar gentleness, cara approaches frank sleeping on the sofa and touches his shoulder.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{frank... i have to go.}
<A>__{he opens his eyes and looks at her.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{don't go out. all you need is here. in four or five days everything will be resolved...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{resolved?}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{it will all be over. i will give you the all clear and you can go back to your life. this will be a great adventure you can look back on.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{when will i see you again?}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{never.}
<A>__{she looks at him evenly; one last glance between two people from two completely different worlds.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{good bye, frank.}
<A>__{she leaves.}
