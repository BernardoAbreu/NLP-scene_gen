<L>__{interior art class day}
<A>__{we see another wall of student art dominated this time by enid's (seymour's) 3' x 4' painting.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{let's address some discussion to this piece.}
<C>__{snotty girl}
<D>__{i don't like it.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{can you tell us why?}
<C>__{snotty girl}
<D>__{i don't know. hippy ish boy i think it's totally weak.}
<C>__{black girl}
<D>__{yeah, it's not right.}
<A>__{more kids respond at once. even margaret is confused.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{these are all valid comments, but i think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{well, i got the idea when i was doing some research and i discovered that cook's chicken used to be called coon's chicken, and so i decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{did you actually do this painting?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{well, no it's more like a "found art object."}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{and how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{it's complicated... i guess i'm trying to show how racism used to more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{and how does an image like this help us to see that?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i'm not sure... i mean...}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{i guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?}
<A>__{a long pause as roberta and the class stare at the painting.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i don't really know what to say, enid...}
<P>__{(another over long pause)}
<D>__{...it's a remarkable achievement.}
