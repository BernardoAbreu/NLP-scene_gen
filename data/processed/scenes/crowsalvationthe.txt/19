<L>__{interior garrison prison death chamber night}
<A>__{the chair, an atavism, sits alone a moment before the entourage enters and begins a surprisingly well choreographed last dance. the warden gestures, and alex is escorted to his place in the chair. the guards move in, death attendants now.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{the lord is my shepherd, i shall not want...}
<A>__{the minister continues as... close. handstraps tightened. whop. whop. alex squirms despite his resolve. through an act of will, calms himself. looks up at... the phone. on the wall. a last possibility of reprise. close. trouser legs slit. footstraps tightened around bare ankles. electrodes checked. close. chest strap tightened. yanked again for good measure. alex gasps. it's hard to breathe now with the strap tight across his chest. close. copper mesh. pieces of sponge jerry sewn onto it, the irregular stitching giving it an unsettling natural appearance. adjust to reveal this is the electrode in the odd leather helmet tightened now on alex's head. the executioner. pulls a hood over his own obscured face. moves behind a half curtain at the side of the room.}
<C>__{minister }
<P>__{(concluding)}
<D>__{... and i will dwell in the house of the lord. forever.}
<A>__{slap. the minister shuts his bible. wider. some weird sin. alex strapped into the chair, unable to move. the guards exit, jobs done. the warden nots and... alex's pov through plexi the observation room revealed as the curtains open. two dozen observers crammed into a space the width of a singlewide trailer. erin. her father. the cops. tommy leonard. gonzalez and other media types. prison personnel. every seat occupied. sweaty and surreal. all looking at him. in the death chamber the warden steps forward.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{alexander frederick corvis. do you have any last words?}
<A>__{a thick silence. alex looks unprepared, uneasy as he scans a sea of hostile faces, settling on erin and her dad.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i loved lauren. i still do. i'm innocent.}
<A>__{erin shakes her head, disgusted. looks away. alex's pov the last seconds of his life slowing in his inner perception, movement ramping down as alex scans the disbelieving faces. the phone. silent. no reprise. the observation room witness door opens. a guard in the back row deferentially offers his seat to the new arrival, a man in dark clothes, his face obscured by reflections in the plexiglass. as he unbuttons his shirt cuff... the warden steps to the side of the room, nods to the executioner who lifts a cover off a large switch. the new arrival pulls his shirtsleeve back over his forearm, exposing a scar for alex, the scar, an odd zigzag pattern of raised welts, a pattern deliberately formed of skin. the executioner throws the switch. on alex shaking violently as he fights to stay alive, time extremely subjective now as he chokes out...}
<C>__{alex }
<P>__{(indistinct, filtered)}
<D>__{murderer!}
<A>__{the word bubbles up as if from underwater, audible only to alex. alex wrenches his head, a superhuman act of will trying to id the scar man through the reflections. the helmet starts to smoke. then a burst of flame at alex's head. a botched execution made worse by alex's struggle to see, to stay alive. in the observation room the observers panic, horrified. only the scar man calm as he covers his arm, rebuttons his shirt. face always obscured. in the death chamber alex in electro spasm, smoke filling the room, the warden in real time now as he runs to pull the curtain closed. it jams partway across. alex expires in the char, grotesquely burned, eyes open as the warden finally yanks the curtain closed. in the observation room the scar man slips out, but the rest remain, transfixed, horrified. erin and others in tears. hold a long beat, their gasps faintly audible. then...}

<D>__{cruel, who's to say, but it sure was unusual.}
