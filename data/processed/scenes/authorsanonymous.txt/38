<D>__{certain things i've learned to avoid. black cats. cracked mirrors. oh. and the number 13 especially. i hate the number 13. hate it.}
<A>__{conversation interrupted by ringing doorbell. hannah frowns at the interruption as maureen scurries to the door and opens it, revealing colette hiding behind a huge gift basket. she breezes in. takes over. over the top.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{hi...hi...hello everyone. i was just in the neighborhood and }
<A>__{colette freezes when she notices the camera.}
<C>__{colette }
<D>__{oh, hannah. i'm so sorry. i didn't know they'd be here }
<A>__{yeah, right. hannah springs up. follows colette as she sets the basket down for all to admire.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{colette. what a lovely surprise!}
<A>__{hugs all around between hannah and maureen and colette. hannah looks blown away by the gift basket.}
<C>__{hannah }
<D>__{my, what's this?}

<A>__{hannah is truly touched. maureen notices a card attached to the basket.}
<C>__{maureen}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"for poodles...now may we have sex again? love, alan."}
<A>__{what? embarrassed, colette snatches the card from maureen. hannah is more focused on the gift. doesn't really hear.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{so sweet of you, colette.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{my pleasure. say, hannah...about your agent?}

<D>__{is he is he taking on new clients?}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{gee. i don't really know.}

<C>__{colette}
<D>__{think you could ask?}
<A>__{awkward situation for hannah. how best to respond?}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{i guess so. maybe.}

<D>__{i've got to go. talk soon. by the way, everything in the basket gluten free!}
<A>__{a final wave to the camera and colette disappears.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{colette mooney. my, that woman is something else.}
<A>__{a light goes off in hannah's head.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(to herself; counting on her fingers)}
<D>__{colette mooney. c o l e t t e m o o n e...}
<A>__{she can't finish the count. the ugly truth is staring her in the face.}
