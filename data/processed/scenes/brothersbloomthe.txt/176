<L>__{exterior beach night}
<A>__{bloom leads penelope down the beach by the hand.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{stephen's gone into town to prep the argentina actors. your money's at his place.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{money? i don't want the money, let's just leave.}
<A>__{for a moment he's tempted. the dark beach house looms ahead.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{c'mon.}
<L>__{interior beach house night}
<A>__{dark. bloom leads penelope in, stumbles in the dark, switches on a lamp. click, click it doesn't come on.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{you have to switch it on at the base.}
<A>__{a beat. bloom does. stephen sits in an easy chair, not looking happy. but not angry. much more sad than angry.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{so i've told her our whole play. and i'm here. to take her money back. how's that make you feel?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{disappointed.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{this isn't the ending you wanted?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{it doesn't matter now. this is the way it ends. so let's get it over with.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{where's the money?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i ate it.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{give me the money, stephen.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{i don't want the money.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{he's not going to keep a single piece of you.}
<A>__{stephen stands.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i'm sorry you fell in love with her. but she's a mark. and all of this, all of it is a con. every moment you shared with her, you were just playing the part of a man falling in love. that's what you're afraid of, right? that you don't know the difference? or maybe that there is no difference. that that's what love is.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{we're leaving.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(to bloom)}
<D>__{no. you're too scared to leave. you're scared to ride off into a sunset that isn't painted tarpaulin, cause real sunsets are beautiful but they turn into dark uncertain nights. if you were ready for that, you wouldn't be here. the money is in my bedroom. right behind me. but in my story you don't get the money or the sunset or the girl.}
<A>__{a long beat. the dark bedroom doorway looms behind stephen.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{bloom. let's just go. please.}
<A>__{bloom lunges, cracking stephen in the jaw. stephen goes down, bloom leaps past him but stephen grabs bloom's leg and brings him down. then they are fighting. penelope watches, horrified. a frightening, brutal brawl that tears the small beach house apart, thirty years worth of a fight. until stephen throws bloom to the ground at penelope's feet. upsetting a small table. the chink's pistol, lying on the holey paper target, falls and strikes the ground. and goes off with a deafening rapport. blood spreads just beneath stephen's collarbone. penelope screams. stephen stays standing for a moment, shocked. a dribble of blood out of the corner of his mouth. he half grins.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{tastes like tin foil.}
<A>__{and sinks to the ground. bloom's eyes glaze. he crawls to his brother. takes him in his arms.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{penelope watches the brothers holding each other. tears in her eyes, but she backs away a step, very conscious of not being a part of this moment. bloom looks up at her, almost taking a moment to recognize her.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{bloom...}
<A>__{he doesn't move from his brother.}
<C>__{penelope }
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{she leaves. for a long moment the brothers bloom lie in each other's arms in the middle of the broken room. then bloom stands, goes to the window and watches penelope walking off into the distance down the beach. from the darkened bedroom doorway steps the chink, her face a mask. stephen stands. lifts his shirt and removes the squib and blood packets. bloom steps outside.}
