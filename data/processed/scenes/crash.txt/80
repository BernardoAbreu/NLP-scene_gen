<A>__{james makes love to gabrielle in the front seat of her small invalid car, deliberately involving the complex hand controls in the mechanics of their sex. as he slips his hand around her right breast, he collides with the strange geometry of the car's interior. unexpected controls jut from beneath the steering wheel. a cluster of chromium treadles is fastened to a steel pivot clamped to the steering column. an extension on the floor mounted gear lever rises laterally, giving way to a vertical wing of chromium metal moulded into the reverse of a driver's palm. amid this small forest of machinery, james explores gabrielle's new and strange body, feeling his way among the braces and straps of her underwear, the unfamiliar planes of her hips and legs, the unique culs de sac, odd declensions of skin and musculature. gabrielle lies back. she lifts her left foot so that the leg brace rests against his knee. in the inner surface of her thigh the straps form marked depressions, troughs of reddened skin hollowed out in the forms of buckles and clasps. james unshackles the left leg brace and runs his fingers along the hot, corrugated skin of the deep buckle groove. the exposed portions of her body are joined together by the loosened braces and straps. through the fading afternoon light the airplanes move across their heads along the east west runways of the airport. gabrielle's hand moves across his chest, opening his shirt, her fingers finding the small scars below his collarbone, the imprint of the instrument binnacle of his own crashed car. she runs the tip of her tongue into each of the wound scars on his chest and abdomen. james exposes her breasts, feeling for the wound areas which surround them. as he tries to enter her, she puts her hand over his mouth.}

<D>__{don't. not there.}
<A>__{she spreads her left leg and exposes a deep, trench like wound scar in her inner thigh. she directs his hand to this neo sex organ.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{do it there. and then after that, do it here.}
<A>__{gabrielle rotates over him so that he can see the wounds of her right hip. james turns her back, pulls her thigh in between his own thighs and enters her scar. with his mouth fastened on the scar beneath her left breast, his tongue exploring its sickle shaped trough, he comes almost immediately.}
