<L>__{interior police conference room morning}
<A>__{file cabinets in the corners. a small rectangle table takes up ninety percent of the space in the room. maurice is seated his legs extended straight on another chair. adelle paces the front of the room.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{and your store? what about your new store? what about all your dreams?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i have new dreams now.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{i don't accept that.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{maybe one day after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{uncle maurice i spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... i have a rented car outside, just listen to me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country gerald and i will come along }
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i have to walk by myself all the way every inch.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{it's impossible.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{it's what she asked for... it's what i'm going to do.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{she was being symbolic. what if she asked you to fly to the moon?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{you'd be visiting me at nasa.}
<A>__{adelle changes gears. she takes a seat next to maurice and studies his legs and tired face carefully before uttering the words.}
<C>__{adelle}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{what if you don't make it?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i will make it.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{if you really want to do this... plan it out. rest up. train for it. build up your body. plan every stop along the way. how much money? time? really do it properly. this is all so by the seat of your pants.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{no it's not.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{why did you take the back roads here? they're not safe. you'd know that if you'd planned.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i've all ready gone six hundred miles... i can't do it again.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{if you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand five hundred miles in your present condition?}
<A>__{maurice is stumped. he looks unsure. he instantly looks on the verge of tears.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{nothing's going to happen.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{uncle, the way i was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. that guy denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... they'll be other dennys, if you don't plan.}
<A>__{maurice stares down at the table the life draining from him with every word she says.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{ellen, deserves you to do this right. really make it if you're going to do it. she deserves it.}
