<L>__{exterior milo's yacht}
<A>__{milo, meanwhile, has also spotted hallenbeck. he growls in rage. hefts the ingram machine gun, as:}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{hallenbeck thrusts forward, hooks his bound hands around the passing anchor and whoosh ! he is catapulted forward, jerked like a rag puppet. bullets chop the water where he just was. he skims over the waves. bounced. battered. trailing behind jimmy at fifty miles an hour. jimmy and darian begin to haul him in. struggling. straining. the boat rushing headlong, driverless. with a last, desperate surge of energy they drag hallenbeck over the side. into the boat.}

<D>__{dad...!}
<A>__{she collapses, weeping, atop her father. hugs him for all she's worth.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{what the hell's she doing here??}
<C>__{darian}
<D>__{i stowed away...}
<A>__{gunfire splits the air. reminds them they're not out of the woods. milo's yacht is behind them again. the fire is out. the chase is on. it steadily cuts the distance. jimmy's boat hallenbeck staggers to his feet.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{get below, darian. and stay there.}
<A>__{he stumbles into the wheelhouse. dazed. barely conscious.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{got any ideas?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{yeah. go really fast and hope they don't catch us.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{fog bank, dead ahead. hang on.}
<A>__{into the fog they go, and, folks this is really scary. because you can't see a foot in front of your face. they plunge through the fog at fifty miles an hour. hallenbeck sweats, eyes glued to the windshield. and then a shape materializes off to port: milo's yacht. running alongside. drawing closer. hallenbeck wrestles the wheel. no dice. the yacht draws ever closer... men on deck... machine guns... joe looks over... and his face tells the story:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{we're dead.}
<A>__{except, just then, a strange thing happens: milo's yacht veers off to the left. away from hallenbeck. jimmy stares, dumbfounded.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{what the fuck? they're peeling off. why?}
<A>__{a pause... then it hits joe like a thunderbolt:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{'cause they got sonar, that's why! hard to port!}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{port?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{left, goddammit.}
<A>__{the boat slews to the left, as, from out of the fog the catalina ferry looms right in front of them.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{shit fuck piss!}
<A>__{they almost make it. as it is, they avoid a head on. instead, they hit broadside. a sickening crunch ! jimmy and joe are thrown from their feet. a momentary glimpse of faces rushing past horrified tourists and then the ferry is behind them. jimmy gets up. staggers to the controls. pushes the throttle. the boat lurches forward then sputters. fizzles. he swears violently.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{we're on half power, we lost an engine!}
