<A>__{as the sun glows bright orange on the horizon, nick raises a pair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista below the ridge. in the lenses of the binoculars, we can clearly see a mixed herd of midsized herbivores hardosaurs, pachycephalosaurs, and callimimuses racing across the plain below. malcolm, also staring through binoculars, lies on the ridge beside him. sarah is several feet behind them, her back pressed against a tree, unwilling to go to the lip of the ridge. through nick's binoculars we see a shaky point of view of the herd running. the binoculars whip to the right revealing a jeep chasing the herd not just one jeep, in fact, but a whole fleet of hunter pursuit vehicles! there are two herding jeeps, one motorcycle, as speedier mini jeep, and, further behind, a container truck and a wrangler's pickup truck. although there's a great deal of commotion below, up here it's almost eerily silent. on the ridge, nick lowers the binoculars, angry. when he raises them again, the sun flares off the lens }
