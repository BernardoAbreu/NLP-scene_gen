<C>__{radio raheem}
<D>__{my music!}
<A>__{radio raheem picks sal up from behind the counter and starts to choke his ass. radio raheem's prized possession his box, the only thing he owned of value his box, the one thing that gave him any sense of worth has been smashed to bits. (radio raheem, like many black youth, is the victim of materialism and a misplaced sense of values.) now he doesn't give a fuck anymore. he's gonna make sal pay with his life. vito and pino jump on radio raheem, who only tightens his grip around sal's neck. buggin' out tries to help his friend. mookie just stands and watches as ahmad, cee, punchy, and ella cheerlead.}
