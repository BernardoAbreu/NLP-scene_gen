<A>__{roger leaps again, his hands catching the window frame. the zombies are clutching at him. again he swings up his legs and kicks the creatures off balance. this time he manages to get his feet locked against the door and peter grabs the troopers arm with his free hand, but another zombie is pulling at the man's shirt and still another makes a grab for his legs. peter reaches out with his pistol and fires a point blank shot at one of the clutching ghouls. it flies back and roger is able to pull himself higher. his torso is just about through the window when another creature grabs him.}
