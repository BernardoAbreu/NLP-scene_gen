<A>__{the distant sounds of the battle in the hall flare up again. the big black man snaps his loaded clip into his pistol and takes a few steps forwards. he sees a corpse wrapped in a bed sheet and tied securely with clothes line. it looks like a mummy. it is writhing, trying to free itself. he shoots it through the head. nearby, a small corpse, that of a very young child, is also writhing, but the end of the shroud, where the child's feet should be, has been torn open and is bloody. a stump kicks around the blood where a foot has been eaten off. the black man fires into the thing's head.}

<D>__{just the fresh corpses... before they revive...}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{why did these people keep them here? why don't they turn them over... or... or destroy them themselves... it's insane... why do they do it?}
<C>__{black}
<D>__{'cause they still believe there's respect in dying.}
<A>__{the big man fires into the head of another squirming zombie.}
