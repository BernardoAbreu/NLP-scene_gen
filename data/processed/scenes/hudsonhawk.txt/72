<A>__{the cardinal emerges and stands by anna's confessional curtains.}
<C>__{cardinal}
<D>__{so let me get this straight, sister, you're saying hudson hawk is not willingly working for the mayflowers but kaplan and the candy bars are ?}
<A>__{anna moves out of the confessional curtains, wearing a full nun habit for she is a nun. the gaspingly beautiful church unfolds as they walk.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you got it. operation deflower mayflower is a bad joke and i'm the punchline. i thought we were using the cia to help us to get mayflower, but really the cia was using me to keep us away from mayflower.}
<C>__{cardinal}
<D>__{oh, why couldn't i be the cardinal in charge of catering.... if the mayflowers get the three sections of da vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine aie yi do we got anything? what of alex, hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm going to find out.}
<C>__{cardinal}
<D>__{i'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to god as well as a mission to the world.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i know, i know, your eminence, just say "god go with me."}
<C>__{cardinal}
<D>__{god go with you, sister.}
