<L>__{exterior park circus day}
<A>__{the rickshaw station. the rain pours down. people clambor for rickshaws. the line moves forward as fast as the pullers can take on passengers. hasari, ram, ramatullah, chomotkar look at the stalled buses, the streetcars, the taxis, the private cars.}
<C>__{chomotkar}
<D>__{what a joy it is to survey this disaster! we will all make a fortune!}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{the monsoon is the great durga's gift to the human horse!}
<A>__{hasari glances at ram, who isn't a part of the joking.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{i'm wet and i'm cold. your daughter is getting married. time is passing. i want to go home to my wife.}
<A>__{chomotkar touches hasari, nods across the street. there, we see the goonda and two thugs.}
<C>__{ramatullah}
<D>__{hasari!}
<A>__{it's hasari's turn. he can't stay to talk with ram now. he has to go.}
<D>__{marwari #4 how much to the market?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{eight rupees. marwari #4 what! i won't pay it!}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{who else needs a ride? i am available at a price!}
<A>__{several others crowd and shove toward him.}
<D>__{marwari #4 no! take me i will pay, let's go!}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{the price just went up! ten rupees! in advance.}
<A>__{the marwari hesitates only as long as it takes him to dig in his soaking wet pants and to slap the bills into hasari's hand and climb aboard. hasari sets out with great difficulty and greater determination through the floodwaters, flicking his eyes at the goonda as he goes.}
