<C>__{hi}
<D>__{honey!}
<A>__{we hear the smack crack of a gunshot and glass impact, but the approaching squad car is still too far down the block to have been the source. hi looks around the parking lot, bewildered. the wailing siren is becoming painfully loud. hi looks behind him at the plate glass front of the store, where a bullet pock mars the glass.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{through the glass we see the pimply young cashier with the paper 7 eleven cap pop up from behind the counter to sight down his huge .44 magnum for another shot. the gun is so big he uses both hands to heft it. smack crack the bullet kisses another hole in the glass. hi is off and running. the squad car is screeching into the lot. an officer tumbles out of the passenger side before the car is fully stopped. he rolls on the pavement, then hurriedly rights himself and takes up a half kneeling shooting stance. at the same time the little cashier is emerging from the 7 eleven with his gun. the two bang away at hi's retreating figure the policeman's revolver popping, the cashier's magnum booming. we hear the policeman who is still in the car drawling over its loudspeaker:}
