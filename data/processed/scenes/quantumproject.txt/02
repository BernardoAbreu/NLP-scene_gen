<L>__{interior the airplane (pentcho) day}
<A>__{puts down a drink glass on the tray table of the seat next to him. places headphones onto his ears. fiddles with the music channels: country, stand up, classical... stays put on a mozart concerto. he gazes back out at the clouds, fails to notice that}
<B>__{his drink glass is moving}
<A>__{sliding slowly across the tray table. it stops near the edge and waits, as pentcho looks up from the window. as his head drifts back toward the clouds outside}
<B>__{the glass moves across the tray table in the other direction}
