<D>__{no, no. there's more. they go back.}

<C>__{deep thought}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{fook}
<D>__{deep thought. do you have...}
<C>__{deep thought}
<D>__{an answer for you? yes. i have.}
<C>__{fook}
<D>__{there really is an answer?}
<C>__{deep thought}
<D>__{yes. there really is one.}
<C>__{fook}

<D>__{oh!}
<C>__{lunkwill}
<D>__{can you tell us what it is?}
<C>__{deep thought}
<D>__{yes. though i don't think you're going to like it.}
<C>__{fook}
<D>__{doesn't matter! we must know it!}
<C>__{deep thought}
<D>__{you're really not going to like it.}
<C>__{fook}
<D>__{tell us!}
<C>__{deep thought}
<D>__{alright. the answer to the ultimate question ...}
<C>__{lunkwill}
<D>__{yes ...}
<C>__{deep thought}

<D>__{yes, but what actually is it?}
<C>__{fook }
<D>__{everything! you know ... just everything!}
<C>__{deep thought }
<D>__{that's not a question. only when you know what the actual question will you know what the answer means.}
<C>__{lunkwill}

<C>__{deep thought}
<D>__{i can't.}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{but there is one who can. a computer that is to come after me, one that i will design. a computer to calculate the ultimate question, one of such infinite complexity that life itself will form part of its operational matrix. and you yourselves shall take on new more primitive forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten million year program. i shall design this computer for you. and it shall be called...}
