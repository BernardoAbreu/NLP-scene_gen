<L>__{interior exterior caves night terrors}
<A>__{over the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows down from the distant mountains. it would be very cold tonight â€“ but cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern; it was merely part of the background of life. this little sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth, was dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. moonwatcher crawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besides the entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley. if any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get back to the relative safety of the cave. of all the creatures who had ever lived on earth, moonwatcher's race was the first to raise their eyes with . interest to the moon, and though he could not remember it, when he was young, moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face. now he new he would have to find a tree that was high enough. he stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from one of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear theo occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. down there in the darkness, old one eye and his family are dying, and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses moonwatcher's mind. the harsh logic of survival rules out such fancies. every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster. and in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing and fearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generations yet to come.}
