<L>__{5. a one column two paragraph news story stuck on an obscure}
<A>__{page. headline reads: "cabbie returns to job." at the end of the clippings, a letter is tacked to the wall. it is a simple letter hand written on plain white paper. the handwriting makes a conscious effort to appear neat and orderly. we recognize that it is the same letter that is being read in voice over. when we finally arrive at the mattress, we find it is barren. a pillow and blanket (new purchases) are folded at the head of the mattress. audio: throughout the track, we hear the voice of a middle aged uneducated man reading in voice over. it is the voice of iris' father and he is reading a letter he sent to travis, and which travis has tacked to his wall.}
<C>__{iris' father }
<D>__{dear mr. bickle, i can't say how happy mrs. steensma and i were to hear that you are well and recuperating. we tried to visit you at the hospital when we were in new york to pick up iris, but you were still in a coma. there is no way we can repay you for returning our iris to us. we thought we had lost her, but now our lives are full again. needless to say, you are something of a hero around this household. i'm sure you want to know about iris. she is back in school and working hard. the transition has been very hard for her, as you can well imagine, but we have taken steps to see she never has cause to run away again. in conclusion, mrs. steensma and i would like to again thank you from the bottom of our hearts. unfortunately, we cannot afford to come to new york again to thank you in person, or we surely would. but if you should ever come to pittsburgh, you would find yourself a most welcome guest in our home. our deepest thanks, burt and ivy steensma}
