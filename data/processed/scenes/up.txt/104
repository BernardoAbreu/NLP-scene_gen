<L>__{exterior mountain, rocky landscape day}
<A>__{carl and russell pull the house through the mist. russell discreetly drops chocolate pieces along their trail. the bird follows, eating.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i see you back there!}

<C>__{carl}
<D>__{go on, get out of here. shoo! go annoy someone else for a while.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{hey, are you okay over there?}
<A>__{the bird dashes away.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{uh, hello?}
<A>__{carl and russell look around. in the midst, some 100 feet away, they see the figure of a man.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{oh! hello sir! thank goodness.}
<A>__{carl walks toward the man.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{it's nice to know someone else is up here!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i can smell you.}
<A>__{carl stops.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what? you can smell us?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i can smell you.}
<A>__{as they get closer, they realize the man is in fact a rock.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{russell giggles.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{you were talking to a rock.}
<A>__{russell points to another rock shape.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{hey, that one looks like a turtle!}
<A>__{sure enough.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{look at that one! that one looks like a dog!}
<A>__{the "rock" walks forward.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{it is a dog!}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{uh, we're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment.}
<A>__{the dog nuzzles russell, who nervously pets it.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{hey, i like dogs!}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{we have your dog!}
<P>__{(to self)}

<C>__{russell}
<D>__{uh huh. speak.}
<C>__{dug}

<A>__{carl and russell freeze.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{did that dog just say "hi there?"}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{oh yes.}
<A>__{carl jumps back.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{my name is dug. i have just met you and i love you.}
<A>__{dug jumps up on to carl.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{uh..wha?}
<A>__{dug wears a high tech collar. the dog's thoughts come out of it as words through a speaker. it can talk. unfortunately, it talks non stop.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{my master made me this collar. he is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that i may talk squirrel!!}
<A>__{dug stares transfixed at a tree. false alarm.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{my master is good and smart.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{it's not possible.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{oh it is, because my master is smart.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{cool! what do these do, boy?}
<A>__{he inspects the collar and twists a dial.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{hey would you }

<D>__{i use that collar }

<P>__{(click)}
<D>__{ to talk with, i would be happy if you stopped.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{russell, don't touch that. it could be radioactive or something.}
<A>__{dug sniffs the ground around carl and russell.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{i am a great tracker. my pack sent me on a special mission all by myself. have you seen a bird? i want to find one and i have been on the scent. i am a great tracker, did i mention that?}
<A>__{bam! the bird tackles dug and hisses.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{hey, that is the bird! i have never seen one up close but this is the bird.}
<P>__{(to carl)}
<D>__{may i take your bird back to camp as my prisoner?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{yes! take it! and on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog!}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{oh i can bark!}
<A>__{dug barks.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{and here's howling!}
<A>__{dug howls. the bird hisses at dug.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{can we keep him? please please please?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{russell falls to his knees, pleading.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{but it's a talking dog!}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{it's just a weird trick or something. let's get to the falls.}
<A>__{carl grabs russell. the bird follows, as does dug.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{please be my prisoner. oh please oh please be my prisoner.}
