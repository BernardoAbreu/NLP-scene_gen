<A>__{peggy enters and approaches richard. he is too engrossed constructing an elaborate kite to notice her.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{what a great kite.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{i'm writing a book on kite construction. what did you want to talk about?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{i want to ask you a question.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{do you think...time travel is possible?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{are you doing some kind of science project?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{sort of.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{well... in a newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.}
<A>__{peggy hasn't understood a word.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{and then, there's richard's burrito.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{that's my own theory based on a mexican food called the burrito. i had it once when my parents took me to disneyland.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{i know what a burrito is.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{well, i think time is like a burrito. sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{what's inside?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{you can till it with whatever you want. from illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{so you think time travel is possible? for people?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{absolutely. people, dogs, elephants.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. you can't tell a soul. promise?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{okay. i promise.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{this is serious. nobody can know. ah, i've returned from the future. i traveled back here 25 years.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{you probably are crazy. wait a minute. is this some kind of joke? i know what you all, think of me.}
<C>__{peggy.}
<D>__{no. really. you're the smartest person i know. it sounds unbelievable. but i can prove it.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{you have a blind grandfather. one day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. i read about it. you're going to be famous. you're going to invent a lot of things.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{how, did you know about my grandfather?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{because i'm telling you the truth. i know what's going to happen. there's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. and an american named neil armstrong is going to walk on the moon. on july 20, 1969.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{holy toledo! that's six years ahead of schedule!}
