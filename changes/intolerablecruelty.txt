<DIAL>__{3/25/97}
<ACTION>__{BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT It is late night, and deserted. Engine noise approaches; headlights appear; as the car draws closer we hear singing. It is a Mercedes convertible and as it roars by, the singing -- a sloppy baritone and a giggling soprano -- whooshes by with it. We hold as another car approaches. This one is a conservative sedan, whose occupant does not sing.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE}
<ACTION>__{The middle-aged driver is in a tuxedo with a rumpled shirt and cocked bow tie. He is flushed, a Rogue forelock bouncing over his forehead, and he merrily sings "Casey Jones" along with the passenger, a young woman in a party dress who squeals, rocks with the motion of the car, and enthusiastically pipes in on the chorus.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANOTHER EMPTY STREET}
<ACTION>__{The convertible makes a hot turn onto the street and approaches with its singing.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{REVERSE}
<ACTION>__{The car enters and roars away. After a beat of quiet, the conservative sedan enters and recedes.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{BEACH}
<ACTION>__{We are at the Malibu Guest Quarters Motel. The singing, squealing Mercedes screeches into the lot and rocks to a halt. The young woman staggers out still giggling, and holding a half-empty bottle of champagne. The man tosses her a key with a large plastic tag.}
<CHAR>__{MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Number Seven.}
<ACTION>__{She trots away. The man twists his rear-view mirror to look at himself. He straightens his bow tie. He puffs his bounding forelock with one finger, nods his head to make it bounce, grins approvingly, and cocks a pistol-finger at his own reflection.}

<DIAL>__{Zing!}
<ACTION_ALT>__{MOTEL ROOM}
<ACTION>__{The man enters and looks around. The young woman's dress is tossed onto the bed but she is nowhere to be seen. The man pulls an imaginary train whistle.}

<ACTION>__{Rex lunges at the young woman and they tumble onto the bed just as -- CRASH -- the door is kicked open and a short stocky black man built like a bulldog and wearing a porkpie hat rushes into the room with a video camera glued to his eye. He looks like Clarence Thomas with a mustache.}
<CHAR>__{MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm gonna nail your ass!}

<ACTION_ALT>__{TRACKING SHOT}
<ACTION>__{All from the perspective of a moving automobile. The moving shots show mansions, palm trees, boutiques; we pass joggers, strolling businessmen holding cellular phones to their ears, male models working as waiters at sidewalk cafes, young women on roller blades who turn, smile, and wave at the camera.

Which side of Tahoe. Great. If the cruise goes all the way around the lake, she left the state and she's in breach. She can't leave the state. Tell Wrigley to prepare a filing to attach everything.

<DIAL>__{The problem is that everyone is willing to compromise. That's the problem with the institution of marriage -- it's based on compromise. Even through its dissolution. One attorney will try to score some points, the opposition will try to impeach. The process will find an equilibrium point determined by the skill of the opposing lawyers, and then each party will walk away with their portion of the "goodies." Some say, "Life is compromise." But at Massey Myerson we believe life is struggle and the ultimate destruction of your opponent.}

<DIAL>__{Time marches on. Ardor cools.}
<CHAR>__{REX} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.}

<DIAL>__{Ah.}
<CHAR>__{REX} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know what I mean when I say "it."}
<CHAR>__{MILES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.}

<DIAL>__{Seems like there's more of it than ever before --}
<CHAR>__{MILES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{MILES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?}

<CHAR>__{MILES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?}
<CHAR>__{REX} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.}
<CHAR>__{MILES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nothing?}
<CHAR>__{REX} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.}
<CHAR>__{MILES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?}

<LOC>__{INT. MASSEY MYERSON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Wrigley sits bouncing the steepled fingers of one hand against the other. Miles sits gazing sadly out the window. The room is empty. There is the whir of ventilation. The click of the door attracts both their attention and brings them to their feet. Marylin walks in, chic and beautiful as ever, followed by Ruth, who sits next to her, places her attache case on the table top, and snaps its clasps.}
<CHAR>__{RUTH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Alright.}
<CHAR>__{WRIGLEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ruth.}
<ACTION>__{Miles and Marylin are looking at each other. Quietly:}
<CHAR>__{MILES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hello Marylin.}
<CHAR>__{MARYLIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hello Miles.}
<CHAR>__{MILES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.}
<CHAR>__{MARYLIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's not something I wanted either.}
<CHAR>__{MILES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.}
<CHAR>__{MARYLIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...}
<CHAR>__{RUTH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now you both wait a minute. Nobody hired anyone to kill anyone.}
<CHAR>__{WRIGLEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hear, hear.}
<ACTION>__{There is an uncomfortable shifting in seats. Wrigley looks at Miles.}
<CHAR>__{WRIGLEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Apparently, from what I can gather, a burglar broke into your house -- became despondent over his lifestyle and shot himself.}
<ACTION>__{Miles is still looking at Marylin.}
<CHAR>__{MILES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Where does that leave us?}
<CHAR>__{RUTH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We've outlined a settlement...}

<CHAR>__{RUTH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We think it's more than generous.}
<ACTION>__{Miles ignores the paper, which lies unclaimed on the middle of the table. He looks at Marylin.}
<CHAR>__{WRIGLEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{My client is prepared to consider a reconciliation.}
<ACTION>__{Marylin looks a Miles.}
<CHAR>__{MARYLIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How could I trust you, after... after all of this.}
<ACTION>__{Miles, staring at Marylin, cuts in:}
<CHAR>__{MILES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You wounded me first, Marylin.}

<CHAR>__{MARYLIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...}
<ACTION>__{Miles, with his eyes still on Marylin, reaches into his suit coat. He withdraws a piece of paper, spreads it flat on the table in front of him and, still gazing at her:}
<CHAR>__{MILES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know... there's nothing in the Massey pre-nup that says it can't be executed after the parties wed.}
<ACTION>__{He decisively clicks the button on a ballpoint pen, looks down at the paper in front of him and scribbles his name. He pushes the paper across the table toward Marylin. Gazing at him, seeking the truth in his eyes, she absently picks up the paper. There is a long silence. We hear only the hum of ventilation, and Wrigley's quiet snuffling. Ruth is looking down her nose through her glasses -- over Marylin's shoulder -- at the sheet of paper. Marylin however, looks only at Miles.}
<CHAR>__{RUTH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's the Massey pre-nup --}

<CHAR>__{WRIGLEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No one will ever love me that way.}
<CHAR>__{RUTH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not if you're lucky. No.}
<ACTION>__{Miles rises slowly to his feet. He puts his knuckles on the tabletop and leans forward. Marylin rises slowly to her feet. She leans forward. They kiss.}
