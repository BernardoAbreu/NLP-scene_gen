<A>__{the homeboy is still attached to the car door by the knife. his legs scurry to keep up with the moving vehicle but it's going too fast so pretty soon he's being dragged. bullets whiz by him. he cries out in agony until half ear has the time to yank out the knife and the homeboy rolls away on the pavement. the car makes a sharp right at the next block and pulls over. the u haul is waiting for them. they get out of the rental car and open its trunk. half ear sees the bullet holes that surround the suitcase. an inch closer and they would've been a crater.}
