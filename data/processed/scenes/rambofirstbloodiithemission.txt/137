<L>__{exterior camp courtyard}
<A>__{the lights of the camp dim, flickering, under the current load.}
<L>__{interior interrogation room}
<A>__{rambo slams convulsively against the electric grid formed by the steel bed. his teeth are clenched as if he has tetanus.}
<L>__{interior prisoners' barracks}
<A>__{the lights come up to normal brightness. de fravio closes his eyes, sharing a ghost of the pain.}

<A>__{rambo hangs from his bonds, heaving and shivering. podovsk turns to him conversationally, as if he were an acquaintance at work rather than a man being tortured.}
<C>__{podovsk}
<D>__{oh, yes. here is something you might be interested in.}
<A>__{he draws a folded piece of paper from his pocket. opens it.}
<C>__{podovsk}
<D>__{a transcript of the conversation between your helicopter pilot and his commander, intercepted and unscrambled by our overworked cryptography staff.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{mmm. "zen hammer... slam dunk." colorful names. here we are: "ah, coach one... we have them in sight." and the reply: "abort immediately. return to base camp."}
<A>__{he graciously shows rambo the printout.}
<C>__{podovsk}

<A>__{he snaps his fingers and palyushin cranks the knob. the lights dim. rambo fights the scream unleashed within him with every fiber of his being. straining like a demon, every muscle sharply defined and rock hard.}
<C>__{podovsk}
<P>__{(almost kindly)}
<D>__{but you must scream. you must. there is no shame.}
<A>__{it bursts out, a roar that frays his vocal cords.}
