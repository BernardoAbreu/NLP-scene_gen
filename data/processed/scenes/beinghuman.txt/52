<L>__{exterior mountain track day}
<A>__{hector smiles as the priest's voice fades into the dis tance. it is a cold fresh day of early summer. they are travelling high in the mountains. hector dawdles on his way, eating a hard biscuit he takes from his pocket. the last sound he hears from the wagon is the renewed wailing of the girl. hector lays himself down at the side of the road. his eyes begin to close. then a sound in the distance makes him open them again. he listens. more sounds drift up to him from the floor of the valley. he stands up and crosses the track. at first he can see nothing. he walks back along the rim of the road. then he sees where the noise is coming from. a mounted skirmish is in progress, just where a wooden bridge crosses the small river, at the very bottom of the valley. there are no more than 30 knights in full armor, with twice as many foot soldiers and squires. even from such a distance hector can see and hear that the fighting is ferocious, almost insane in its intensity. from this distance it is like a puppet show, except the violence is real. the scene places hector in his time and for us there is a strange feeling to it, almost as if hector has awoken from sleep and found himself transported to some distant age. but this is not the case. hector is where he belongs, in medieval europe. hector makes his decision. with a last look behind him he runs off in the direction of the wagon. like any wise citizen of a violent age, hector knows when to leg it.}
