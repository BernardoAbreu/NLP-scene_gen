<A>__{medium shot ninotchka's room evening the curtains are drawn and the lamp lighted. all four are sitting around the table, in the center of which is a samovar. in front of each of them is a glass of tea. one of the russians is playing a balalaika and all are singing gaily, "paris." ninotchka is enjoying their companionship. after a little while the door to the corridor opens and ninotchka's other roommate, the street car conductor, strides in. she is a squareset, unfriendly woman in uniform. at sight of her one of the russians nudges ninotchka, makes the gesture of ringing up a fare, and accompanies it with an inquiring look. ninotchka nods. the russians change their tune quickly to the "volga boatman" in order not to awaken animosity. the street car conductor goes to her bed and starts to take off her shoes and her coat, then draws the curtain. during the following scene we hear the splash of water and the sound of gargling. again gurganov crosses the room, this time accompanied by his little son. suddenly the door is opened by vladimir, a friendly old man.}

<A>__{ninotchka sits in the chair nearest the lamp. all three are looking over her shoulder. ninotchka hesitates to open the letter, obviously wanting to read it all by herself. realizing her feelings, the three russians walk to the far end of the room and sit down on a little bench, looking toward ninotchka with childlike expectancy. in great anticipation ninotchka opens the letter. she starts to read it. suddenly her expression changes to one of terrific disappointment. she turns the letter over, glances at the second page, then puts the letter down on the table. the russians have followed her expression closely. slowly they walk over to her.}
