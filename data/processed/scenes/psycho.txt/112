<L>__{interior motel office (twilight)}
<A>__{norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen closet, suddenly pauses, turns, studies arbogast, who has remained standing by the door.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you out to buy a motel?}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{oh. i thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days... what was it you wanted to ask?}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{i'm looking for a missing person.}
<P>__{(takes out and opens}
<D>__{wallet and extends}
<P>__{it as he speaks)}
<D>__{my name's arbogast, private investigator...}
<P>__{(takes back wallet}
<D>__{when norman doesn't}
<P>__{look at it)}
<D>__{trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. from phoenix.}
<P>__{(a look at norman's frightened expression)}
<D>__{it's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{she isn't in trouble.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(forcing a smile)}
<D>__{i didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{i'm not the police.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{he waits a moment, then opens closet, starts counting out sheets and pillow cases, keeps his back to arbogast. arbogast takes a photograph out of his pocket, talks as he crosses to norman.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{we have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...}
<P>__{(extends photograph,}
<D>__{which norman doesn't}
<P>__{glance at)}
<D>__{did she stop here?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{no. no one has stopped here in weeks...}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{committing myself to what? you sure talk like a policeman.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{look at the picture. please.}
<A>__{norman glances, briefly, turns away, lifts sheets and pillow cases off the shelf holds them close, almost protectively.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{no. at least i don't recall.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{she might have used an alias. mary crane's the real name, but she might've registered...}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i don't even bother with guests registering any more... i mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.}
<P>__{(more relaxed, because}
<D>__{arbogast is listening}
<P>__{with a pleasant smile)}
<D>__{i shouldn't even bother to change the linen. i guess habits die hard. which reminds me...}
<A>__{he goes to the wall, flips a light switch.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{the vacancy sign. just in case.}
<A>__{we had a couple the other night, said if the sign hasn't been on they'd have thought this was an old deserted mining town or something.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{you thought no one has stopped here in weeks. now, try to remember if this girl...}
<C>__{arbogast}
<P>__{(a pause, a study)}
<D>__{maybe she even signed the register... because habits die hard. let's check it, huh?}
<A>__{norman says nothing. arbogast goes to the desk, pulls the registry book around, flips back a page or two. norman simply stares at the man. arbogast hums faintly, pleasantly, as he examines the pages. then:}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{yes sir! marie samuels. interesting alias.}
<A>__{he takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, lays it beside the signature in the registry book, all the while nodding and smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make norman as happy as it is making him.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{don't know where she got "marie," but "samuels" figures. her boy friend's name is sam.}
<P>__{(turns to norman, the smile gone)}
<D>__{was she in disguise? or do you want to check the picture again?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i didn't lie to you. i just have trouble keeping track of... time.}
<A>__{arbogast has reached him, the picture extended. norman looks dutifully at it.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, i guess.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{tell me all about her.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{she arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{how early?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{very early. dawn.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{of which morning?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{the following morning. sunday.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{no one met her?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{or arrived with her.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{she didn't call anyone? even locally?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{you didn't spend the whole night with her did you?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{no! of all...}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{how do you know she didn't make a call?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{she was tired. she said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... yes, now i'm remembering very clearly because i'm picturing. when you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. she was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{back where?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{you said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{oh. my private parlor. she had an awful hunger... so i made her some supper. and then she went to bed and left in the morning. i didn't even see her leave.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{how did she pay you?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{cash or check? for the cabin...}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{cash.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{and when she left, she never came back.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{why should she? i'm sorry, i have work to do, mr... if you don't mind...}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{i do mind. if it don't jell, it ain't aspic!}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{this ain't jelling.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{she isn't still here, is she?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{not at all!}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{suppose i wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would i need a warrant?}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(as if pleasantly exasperated)}
<D>__{look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. you can help me make beds if you like.}
<P>__{(laughs, shakes his head)}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{he starts out. arbogast pauses, momentarily confused by the young man's openness.}
