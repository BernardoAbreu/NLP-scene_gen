<A>__{roosevelt meets with his advisors.}
<C>__{roosevelt}
<D>__{gentlemen, the crisis we face is not the fact that our enemies believe they can defeat us it's the fact that our people believe it too. i want a plan a workable plan to hit the heart of japan, to bomb them the way they have bombed us.}
<C>__{admiral}
<D>__{mr. president, pearl harbor caught us because we didn't face facts. this isn't a time for ignoring them again. there are no planes in the entire american arsenal capable of covering the distance to japan from any land base we control while carrying enough bombs to do any damage whatsoever.}
<C>__{general marshall}
<D>__{he's right, mr. president. the army has long range bombers, but no place to launch them from. midway's too far, china is overrun by japanese forces, and russia refuses to go to war with japan and won't allow us to launch a raid from there.}
<C>__{admiral}
<D>__{the navy's planes are small, carry light loads, and have short range. we would have to get them within a few hundred miles of japan, and therefore risk our carriers. and if we lose our carriers, we have no shield against invasion.}
<C>__{roosevelt}
<D>__{what if the japanese did invade?}
<C>__{general marshall}
<D>__{we've done studies. we're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as chicago.}
<C>__{admiral}
<D>__{mr. president...with all respect...what you are asking can't be done.}
<A>__{roosevelt places his hands on the arms of his wheelchair, and struggles to lift himself. aides jump to help him, but he waves them off. with inhuman physical effort, that has his neck veins bulging and sweat popping on his face, roosevelt stands on his withered legs.}
<C>__{roosevelt}
<D>__{do not tell me...it can't be done.}
