<A>__{the camera slowly tracks in toward the book of the dead as it sits in the darkness of the stone tomb. next to it rests the kandarian dagger, an ancient knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a weasel. they rest upon a small pedestal covered with cobwebs. prominently displayed on the stone wall, a bas relief of the "hero from the sky" holding his unusual jagged edged weapon.}

<D>__{and then...}
<A>__{the grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard, and a large stone is swung open on a secret hinge in the wall behind the book. wind sweeps in through the tomb, along with the blinding light from outside. a sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created doorway. the figure lights a torch that he holds, illuminating his face. this is professor raymond knowby. an intelligent, grey bearded man in his late fifties. he lowers the cloth around his face that had been protecting him from the sand. he stares at the book, awestruck. behind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of the tomb. the first is a large school marmish woman, the wife of raymond knowby, henrietta. she moves to raymond's side and takes his hand. immediately behind her is their daughter, annie knowby; twenty four years old, strong stance and beautiful. behind her a handsome looking man, ed getly, enters the tomb. he moves to annie's side. they exchange excited glances. the camera pans down to the book.}
