<A>__{close on a peeling wall mural smiling 30s cartoon cow winking at us, licking her chops. the logo reads: "tasty". blade's matte black charger rumbles into view and parks in front of the abandoned milk factory. blade steps out, heaving an equipment sack onto his shoulder.}
<L>__{interior warehouse night}
<A>__{three laconic vampire toughs are playing poker at a card table, dealing out novelty nudie cards. we hear a noise. one of the vampires approaches a reinforced door. he slides open a viewing slot and peers through. nobody outside. the vampire turns back to his poker buddies, shrugging }

<A>__{before the vampire can even finish his sentence, blade's sword punches straight through the door into his chest. he gasps and turns to ash as the sword disengages back out through the door and crash! the door explodes open, sending clouds of burning vampire embers every which way. in walks blade, grinning wickedly, mach ready as the other two vampires rise pow! a silver hollow point hits the first one in the neck. pow! another hollow point takes out the second. the vampires drop, turning to ash. blade holsters his mach, striding through vampire ash piles. the place is eerily quiet here, in stark contrast to the mayhem of the last few minutes. just the steady, low pitched hum of machinery. blade starts forward. up ahead, a faint glow is emitting from behind an area that's been sectioned off with canvas tarps. blade sweeps one of the tarps aside }

<A>__{whistler's ace drifts around into view. blade shakes his head in sadness. he looks about for a way to extract whistler, doesn't see any obvious means, then crash! blade kicks through the glass. blood and fluids flood out around him as whistler's limp body tumbles partly down, but he's still suspended by the wires and medical leads. blade unsheathes his sword, severing the wires whistler falls into his arms. blade cradles him, then the gunsmith's eyes abruptly snap open, flooding with rage. blade staggers back as the howling horror that used to be his mentor wraps his hands around blade's throat, forcing him to the ground. whistler roars, revealing a set of jagged fangs.}

<D>__{ to fucking finish me off!}
<A>__{blade knees whistler in the balls. whistler lets go, cupping his groin as blade heaves him aside. blade strips off his gauntlets. whistler springs at him again. blade sinks his fist deep in whistler's stomach. as whistler doubles over, blade twists whistler's hands behind his back, cuffing his wrists together with a pair of titanium manacles. blade pulls a restraint hood from his equipment bag and quickly slips it over whistler's head, cinching it tight. another beat. whistler doesn't stir. he's down for the count. blade pauses a moment, catching his breath as he leans on whistler's still form. he's exhausted.}
