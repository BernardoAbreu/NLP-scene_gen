<A>__{marco is here, too his head wrapped in a bandage, he's wearing hospital greens. wires and tubes are rigged to his head, chest, arms and legs like some high tech marionette all coiling up into the shadows of the high ceiling, into thicker cables and tubes beneath which robotic bracket arms adjust, whirring softly, with his every movement ... he's drugged to the gills, jerking with spasms as low voltage electricity courses through his brain ... ... and the women's shrill zaghareet peaks }
<C>__{noyle }
<D>__{captain marco }
<B>__{dr. atticus noyle}
<A>__{the mysterious arabic woman has become the sleek, caucasian scientist, atticus noyle, whose oddly accented english is flawless:}
<C>__{noyle}
<D>__{ when you're rescued and returned with your patrol to command headquarters, what will be among the first duties you will undertake?}
<A>__{on marco all rigged up with his wires }
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{i will recommend sergeant shaw for the medal of honor, ma'am. he saved our lives, terminated the enemy and led us across the desert to safety.}
<A>__{now the dreamscape visuals seem rear projected on luminous, rippling white fabric ... the bedouin people, tomato brain images, the mystery woman, appear as two dimensional filmed images, flickering across draperies ...}
<C>__{noyle}
<D>__{yes. brilliant. but there were casualties?}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{there are always casualties, ma'am.}
<A>__{... the dream sounds (wind, fabric, women chanting) emanate from audio speakers, the sandstorm's wind caused by huge, moveable fans ... ... impression of an old man shaking a percussive gourd, mesmerizing ... ... impressions of the squad all rigged up like marco, with tubes and wires ... laurent glides behind them lab coat, surgical gloves on his hands ... a collection of remote cameras on scaffolding and tripods buzz and whir as they swivel to follow him.}
<C>__{noyle}
<D>__{here, then, are ten subject soldiers in a clinically induced functional fugue state. hyperdelusional that they've been bivouacked in a small caravansary to wait out a sandstorm.}
<A>__{marco blinks: sees the mysterious arabic woman dressed in noyle's simple suit.}
<C>__{mysterious woman}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{a simple pavlovian parlor trick.}
<A>__{snapping of fabric, the wind gets louder. marco looks around no more tubes or wires, and noyle is now a projected image on the fabric. the dreamscape is bending, smearing ... realities overlapping. pushing in on spooky, herky jerky, streaming video style}
