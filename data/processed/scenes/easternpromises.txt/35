<D>__{semyon is unlocking the door and discovering, in the drizzle and half light, that it is anna.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{ah. my dear! i wasn't expecting you so early.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{is it ok?}
<L>__{interior trans siberian restaurant night}
<D>__{semyon and anna are sitting down at the candlelit table. anna fumbles in her bag and produces a sheaf of photocopied sheets. she has photocopied the pages of the diary and they are laid out in segments on each page.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i copied the whole thing. semyon takes the pages and looks troubled.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{where is the original?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm going to keep it. maybe give it to tatiana's daughter someday. semyon looks thwarted but hides it well. he studies the photocopied sheets for a while then looks up and smiles.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{i will need my spectacles and a clear head. today i broke my rules and drank vodka. tomorrow i will translate it. he folds the papers carefully.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{then i will bring what i have done to your home. where do you live, anna? there is nothing in semyon's smile to cause alarm but anna perhaps remembers nikolai. finally...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{not far. i can drop by and pick it up.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{then maybe i can drive you home.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm fine. i'm on my motorbike. semyon stares at her for a moment.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{so what will happen to the poor child?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{after christmas, they'll do a missing persons report.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{who will?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{the police. semyon doesn't blink. at that moment a little girl of seven (maria) emerges from the darkness, carrying a soft toy.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{grandpa.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{hey, hey, maria, go back to bed.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{i'm too sad. next christmas isn't for another hundreds and hundreds of days. semyon takes her onto his knee. as he does, we see, for the first time, an eagle tattoo on his wrist.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{but you have had so many presents. the girl wafts semyon's cigar smoke.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{you shouldn't smoke, grandpa.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{i know. semyon cuddles maria and stubs his cigar. anna smiles at the warm family scene, perhaps remembering her own father.}
