<A>__{rayburn pulling away, sitting on the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{rayburn}
<D>__{you mean a misfire?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i mean nothing. the hammer came down and nothing happened. dimple on the primer.}
<C>__{rayburn}
<D>__{i've heard of it. never happened to me though. maybe the firing pin's off.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{maybe...}
<A>__{creasy is troubled about it all to say the least.}
<C>__{rayburn}
<D>__{it's like we always used to say: a bullet always tells the truth. what were you shooting at?}
<A>__{creasy doesn't answer. he holds the bullet up, looks at it.}
<C>__{rayburn}
<P>__{(focusing; concerned)}
<D>__{creasy?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{sorry i woke you, ray.}
<A>__{creasy clicks off the phone. he starts back toward the house, but stops short again. there she is. pinta. standing in the window of her room. she's been watching him. it's like creasy seeing her for the first time. and she's been watching him forever. no easy answer for it. they're connected somehow.}
