<A>__{mr. pick runs from the crazed prisoners chasing him. fires his gun back at them, dropping one or two but then runs out of bullets. the prisoners slowly surround him. he backs away. one of those chains that run throughout the castle has its base here. mr. pick keeps backing up, unavoidably, the deranged prisoners closing in until he falls backwards with a cry into the grinding wheels of the chain system. caught up in the chain, he's carried aloft with it, up to the ceiling. the chain is the lifeline of the castle and does not, could not, ever stop. instead it forces mr. pick to go along with it, his head cracking through the glass or wood "manhole" cover through which the chain passes.}
