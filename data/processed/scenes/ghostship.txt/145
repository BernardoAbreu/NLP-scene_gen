<A>__{an eye extremely close as a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated.}
<C>__{epps }
<D>__{hard to say.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{greer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing as epps shines a flashlight into his eye, dodge and murphy looking on. she turns it off, standing upright.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i'm no doctor. but i'd say he's in a coma.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{a what?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i don't know what else you'd call it. he's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. he's totally unresponsive to pain.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{what happened up there?}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{i heard a scream. when i got there i found him on the floor. he was having some kind of seizure. i didn't see anybody else.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{he must've seen something.}
<A>__{a beat as they consider this.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that i can see, not on the outside.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{then what the hell happened to him?}
<A>__{another beat as they hold there.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{just before i heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{greer?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i don't know. no. not greer. somebody.}
<A>__{another long beat as they think about this.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{it was a man's voice. repeating some sort of children's rhyme. i don't know, it didn't make any sense. you didn't hear it?}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{not me.}
<A>__{another beat as this sinks in.}
<C>__{epps}
<P>__{(looking to greer)}
<D>__{he needs a doctor.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i will call us in. dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.}
<P>__{(to epps, meaning dodge)}
<D>__{keep an eye on him.}
