<L>__{interior concert hall night}
<A>__{all we see is the audience pouring into the hall. georges and anne, both are around eighty, are part of this crowd. they go to their seats in one of the rows near the front. once everybody is seated, we hear the usual announcement asking people to turn off their mobile phones. some people, caught with their phones switched on, hasten to comply. then the lights go out. applause. off screen, we hear the soloist make his entrance. throats are cleared here and there. finally, the music begins.}
