<B>__{thunder strike.}
<A>__{the drill bit spins as rain pelts the ground turning the dark soil into black mud. curtis holds a rain slicker over his head. he watches as the hole they are drilling fills up with brown water. he lifts his boot, which makes a sucking sound as it dislodges from the mud. looking at the horizon, he sees no sign of the storm letting up. he looks to dewart, who smiles at him from behind the controls of the rig.}

<A>__{running for her car holding a jacket covered car seat. samantha closes the door and listens to her quiet house. the rain outside is the only noise. she heads to the kitchen. in the kitchen, hannah is sitting indian style at the glass doors watching the rain. samantha walks over and kneels down behind her. she wraps her arms around hannah, who lifts a hand to the glass.}
<C>__{samantha }
<D>__{can you sign s t o r m?}
<A>__{samantha puts her hand onto the glass next to hannah's and signs "s t o r m". hannah turns to see her mother's face, and samantha uses both hands to make the signed symbol. fingers, spread and bent, moved downward.}
<C>__{samantha }
<D>__{storm.}
<A>__{hannah looks back out the window. they watch the storm together. i e. curtis' truck dewart's house night the blue top of a small cooler is knocked to the floorboard as dewart fishes the last busch tallboy out of icy water. he cracks it open and takes an extended sip. curtis, sitting behind the wheel of his truck, looks at his drunk friend.}
