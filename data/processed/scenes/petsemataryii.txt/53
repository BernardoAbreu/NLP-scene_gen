<A>__{even in broad daylight, the flat topped mesa has a sense of foreboding isolation. there's an almost palpable sense of "wrongness" about this place. as if the darkness of a dying black hole was seeping out of the ground and spreading across the earth. drew and geoff approach the circle of rocky soil. they stand at the border, looking it over in eerie silence. somewhere off in the distance we hear the unearthly sound again, only this time, it's closer.}

<D>__{look, let's just get this over with.}
<A>__{even drew seems to have awakened from the haze he had fallen into. he gently sets zowie's body on the ground.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{if this doesn't work... don't ever tell anyone i did this, okay? you gotta promise...}
<A>__{geoff nods and hands over the digging tools. drew swings the pickaxe, sinking it into the ground.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{you want me to help?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you have to bury your own. that's the way the indians did it. it's like a rule...}
<A>__{backing away from the burial ground, geoff takes a seat on a rock at the border of the forest. from there, he watches. drew alternates the pickaxe and shovel as he clears a hole in the rocky ground. we move in on geoff, who's looking on with skeptical intrigue as the rhythmic sound of the tools continues.}
