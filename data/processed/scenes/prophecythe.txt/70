<L>__{interior the schoolhouse}
<A>__{thomas's breath escapes in warm clouds here in the unheated, abandoned part of the building. rats scurry away from feeding on the dark, human like stain on the floor as thomas crouches down beside it. he probes the dried, black, crusty flotsam with his ball point pen. just like the burned body back at the morgue. far away you can hear the sounds of children. of a teacher's voice.}
<B>__{downstairs}
<A>__{it's only past the final door, into the smallest corner of the building, that the walls become clean and brightly painted by eager third graders. the creepy silence transforms itself into the giggles of children as they bang open the classroom door and whoop themselves outside for recess. the last one out is katherine. she's surprised to see thomas.}
<C>__{daggett}

<A>__{katherine unlocks a hall cabinet and pulls out a stack of volleyballs. she tosses two to thomas.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{here, make yourself useful.}
<A>__{arms full, she pushes the building door open with her shoulder and backs out into the sunshine. she tosses the balls out to the kids.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{okay, everbody stays on the courts today.}

<A>__{the children skitter back and forth playing.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{the man upstairs, did you talk to him?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i wanted to know what the hell he was doing there.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{that it wasn't part of the plan. he looked hurt. bloody. like someone had cut him. that happens here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{was that... stuff... on the floor really him?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{did any of the children talk to him?}
<C>__{katherine}

<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{military man?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{about a million years ago. his interests lately were more like gardening and herbal tea.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{did you go to the funeral?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{everyone did. he lived here.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{no dark hidden secrets?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{there are no secrets in small towns, mr. dagget, dark or otherwise.}
<B>__{across the street}
<A>__{up the crumbly embankment, sitting perched on the roof of an abandoned house, is gabriel. he watches thomas walk to his car. he watches the children playing, lifting his nose to snort the air, like a coyote.}
