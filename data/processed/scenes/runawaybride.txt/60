<L>__{exterior gill's garage day}
<A>__{maggie drives up to an old brick firehouse that is now an auto garage. the faded sign reads: "gill's garage".}
<L>__{interior gill's garage day}
<A>__{maggie rushes inside and looks around. no one is in sight. several cars, including a yellow jeep like car up on a hydraulic lift, are in the funky garage.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{gill? lydia? gill? a crash, coming from the nearby back room, we hear loud muttering in spanish, then out stumbles gill chavez, 34, wearing a grease stained grateful dead tie dyed t shirt. he grins triumphantly, worshipfully cradling a cassette tape in his hands.}
<C>__{gill}
<A>__{hey i found it! maggie regards her former fiance with patient warmth.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{found what? gill looks up and gives maggie a fond, hazy smile.}
<C>__{gill}
<A>__{mags! hey, look the tape from the radio city music hall concert remember that night i as trying to get jerry to let me sit in on "ripple"? he pulls out the cassette from its case. it's broken. the tape is dangling from the cassette.}
<C>__{gill }
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<A>__{oh, i will play it for you. gill picks up an electric guitar and starts to play.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(shouts over the music)}
<A>__{listen, gill there's this reporter who's ben making my life a living hell ... if he comes by here, don't talk to him. and whatever yo do....}
<P>__{(crosses to gill)}
<A>__{... don't show him that picture of me at the concert in san francisco suddenly, a loud chuckling emanates from the car overhead.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{what was that? maggie stops gill from playing. she shoots her ex an angry glare and moves a lever on the shop wall. with a hum, the car descends.}
<C>__{gill}
<A>__{we went to san francisco twice. remember one time we had a flat tire... which picture? as the hydraulic lift slows, the car is lowered, revealing ike sitting in the driver's seat. he has been enjoying the photograph he's holding.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(feigning shock)}
<A>__{imagine! maggie carpenter topless in a public arena.}
<P>__{(checks photo again)}
<A>__{and i see there was a chill in the air. maggie swipes for the photo, but ike is faster at pulling it away.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{give me that!}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{but the most interesting thing here is that i don't see the rose tattoo that i've heard about on your back. gill takes off his guitar and sets it down.}
<C>__{gill}
<A>__{ike bet me fifty bucks you don't still have it, mags. i said "you're on, man! maggie loved that thing!" and i could really use fifty bucks. maggie is conspicuously silent.}
<C>__{gill }
<P>__{(looking worried)}
<A>__{mags?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i'm not gonna show you guys anything. i am a soon to be married woman. now give me that photograph. maggie seethes.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{sure, i would love to give this to you. just give us one quick gander at that rose, and, i will gladly hand it over. she tries to grab the photo again. ike pulls it away.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{fine. here. maggie quickly turns around and pulls down the back of her shirt, revealing the top of her back and a pristine expanse of skin. no tattoo.}
<C>__{maggie }
<P>__{(turning back around)}
<A>__{satisfied?}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{completely. gill is still trying to grasp the meaning of this.}
<C>__{gill}
<A>__{maggie? you got it removed?}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{gill, i will go ya double or nothing if was a stick on.}
<C>__{gill}
<P>__{(dismayed)}
<A>__{maggie?}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(admitting)}
<A>__{i'm really, really afraid of needles... it doesn't make me a bad person. ike laughs. maggie looks at him with rage. gill dramatically pulls down the front of his t shirt.}
<C>__{gill}
<A>__{look. there it is on gill's chest: the rose tattoo. maggie sighs, pained. gill shows it to ike. ike looks at the tattoo. he shakes his head at maggie.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(sincerely)}
<A>__{look, look, man. i think the man is heartbroken.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{he is not! maggie moves the lever on the wall again, sending ike back up to the ceiling in the car. she grabs the photo from ike and exits.}
<C>__{gill}
<A>__{i think i am. gill grabs his guitar and sits.}
<C>__{gill }
<A>__{hey, ike, what would jerry do? the hydraulic lift stops moving. ike leans out.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{jerry. he'd play. he'd play... jerry would play his heart out. ike sings and taps along in tempo on the side of the car as gill sings and plays "ripple".}
