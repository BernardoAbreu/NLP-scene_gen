<ACTION>__{"ALTHOUGH THIS MOTION PICTURE IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY, CERTAIN CHARACTERS AND EVENTS ARE FICTIONAL."}
<TRANS>__{FADE IN:}
<ACTION>__{SUPER: 'SEPTEMBER 1973'.}
<LOC>__{INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A phone rings in the dark. A little light falls from the open window, illuminating an old bakelite telephone. It sits on a small table alongside a large amount of empty bottles and a couple of overflowing ashtrays.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PHIL'S TRIKE. NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A three wheeled motorcycle is being driven through the night at great speed. The trike is moving very quickly, its headlights cutting through the darkness, its wheels sending a spray of sand flying towards us, as the driver fights to keep it on the road. This is PHIL KAUFMAN, and he's in a hurry.}
<LOC>__{INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Two figures are struggling on the floor. The male is naked. The woman sits astride him, her movements urgent, her breath fast. They appear to be having sex.}
<LOC>__{EXT. TRIKE. DAWN}
<ACTION>__{The Trike cuts through the night, and we pull back to show desert, more desert, and then... a giant bright, flickering neon sign: 'Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn'.}
<LOC>__{INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{That phone - still ringing; shrill, insistent. There is a bed next to the table. It is covered in clothes, but there is also a man's shape, which now moves.}
<LOC>__{INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A little more light, and it now appears as if our man and woman are struggling. There is fear on her face.}
<LOC>__{INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Still that insistent ringing, and the covers suddenly fly off the bed. We see the man from behind as he shakes the sleep away and looks for the damn phone.}
<LOC>__{INT. JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The woman is screaming now, and banging on the man's chest with her fists. He is motionless underneath her.}
<LOC>__{EXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN. DAWN}
<ACTION>__{The Trike skids to a halt amid a cloud of dust and the driver leaps off. He runs at the door, throwing it open in one movement, disappearing into the room. A broken striped 'No Entry - Police' band flutters to the ground.}
<LOC>__{INT. PHIL KAUFMAN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The man finally answers the phone.   At last the ringing stops.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hello?}
<LOC>__{EXT. OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8. NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The door bounces back open, and we can see the Phil walking quickly through the room. As he searches, we hear:}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh my God please help me! I found your number in his pocket and I don't know... I don't know what to do.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{WOMAN'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He's dead... he's dead... and I'm... just... I don't know what to do.}

<DIAL>__{Joshua Tree. Joshua Tree Inn. Room eight.}
<ACTION>__{He checks on top of the wardrobe.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Have you got a car?}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Call an ambulance. Then get out of there. Okay? Okay?}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, okay. I'm goin'...}
<ACTION>__{He picks up a sheet of paper from the bedside table and glances at it. He turns and walks past us to the car and for the first time we see Phil Kaufman's face.}
<LOC>__{EXT. JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL. MORNING}
<ACTION>__{The Trike skids to a halt outside the small white hospital. There are a couple of press vehicles parked outside, and a reporter is recording a piece to camera in the background. Phil sits for a moment, and then opens the door and walks to the entrance.}
<LOC>__{INT. JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER}
<ACTION>__{We move through the reception area up to the nurses' station. Phil is in conversation with a large woman in a nurse's uniform.}
<CHAR>__{NURSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You wanna run that by me again, sir?}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{NURSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You want to see Gram Parsons?}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes. Alone, if possible. And would you have a gurney standing by in case I need to move him?}
<ACTION>__{She looks carefully at the pyjamas which peek out from under the shabby overcoat. His hair is on end. He is wearing biker boots and is holding an unlit but half-smoked cigar.}
<CHAR>__{NURSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And you are.... his physician? Or perhaps a close relative?}
<ACTION>__{Phil clears his throat.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Actually, I'm his road manager.}
<ACTION>__{The big nurse smiles mirthlessly.}
<CHAR>__{NURSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So you're not his physician or a close relative?}
<ACTION>__{A beat.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<CHAR>__{NURSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mister Parsons is awaiting a post mortem. He will then be delivered to his family. I suggest you speak to them if you wish to pick through his personal effects. Sir.}
<ACTION>__{She turns away.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now listen here...}
<CHAR>__{NURSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, you listen here. Mister Parsons is dead and no longer appears to need a road manager. Which makes two of us.}
<ACTION>__{The nurse turns and marches down the corridor. Phil waits until she's gone and then walks through a door marked 'Admittance only to Authorized Hospital Staff'.}
<LOC>__{INT. HOSPITAL LOCKER ROOM. MORNING}
<ACTION>__{Phil slips off his overcoat and stuffs it into the trash. He tosses away the unlit cigar, grabs a white coat from a hook and puts it on. He walks out through another door.}
<LOC>__{INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. MORNING}
<ACTION>__{Phil wanders down the corridor, glancing into rooms and checking signs. He pushes open a door marked 'Pathology'.}
<LOC>__{INT. HOSPITAL PATHOLOGY LAB. MORNING}
<ACTION>__{The room is empty, except for a couple of covered bodies on trolleys. Phil checks under the first sheet, and recoils at whatever it is which lies beneath.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sheesh!}
<ACTION>__{He walks over to the next gurney and lifts the sheet.   He stares down at the body, visibly moved.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Hello buddy. How you been?}
<ACTION>__{He stands for a moment, gripping the gurney and looking down at his friend. Then he snaps out of it.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Well, I can't stand around here chatting with you all day. Things to do...}
<ACTION>__{He wheels the gurney towards the door.}
<LOC>__{INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. MORNING}
<ACTION>__{Phil wheels the gurney down the corridor towards the exit. A doctor in green scrubs approaches and glances down at a clipboard.}
<CHAR>__{DOCTOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can I help you?}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Naw, I'm cool thanks.}
<ACTION>__{The doctor reads the tag on the body's toe.}
<CHAR>__{DOCTOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What are you doing?}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Just taking some stiff down to neurology.}
<TRANS>__{CON TINUE D:}
<CHAR>__{DOCTOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We don't have a neurology department.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Urology.}
<ACTION>__{The doctor grabs the end of the gurney. Phil tugs and the doctor tugs back. After a moment, Phil sighs and shakes his head in frustration.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Okay. Just hold your horses - I'll go check the paperwork.}
<ACTION>__{The doctor holds up his clipboard.}
<CHAR>__{DOCTOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I have the paperwork.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No. You have your paperwork. I need to go check my paperwork.}
<ACTION>__{He slips through the exit. The doctor waits awkwardly     for a few seconds, and then pushes open the door.}
<CHAR>__{DOCTOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hello?   Hello...}
<ACTION>__{He glances around in surprise, but there is no-one in sight.}
<LOC>__{EXT. DESERT. MORNING}
<ACTION>__{Phil's trike accelerates as it approaches a T junction.      To the right the sign points to 'Joshua Tree Town', to the left 'Los Angeles'. The trike doesn't even slow as it skids left, sending a spray of sand and gravel flying across the road. NB. There will be several shots of Phil driving through the desert, set to music.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PHIL'S STREET. DAY}
<ACTION>__{The Trike pulls up outside a rambling old house. Two enormous plaster eagles flank the front door, a giant Harley Davidson sign hangs from the roof, and there's a six foot flashing neon star in the front window. Phil gets out, walks up to the door and pulls some keys out of his pocket.}
<LOC>__{INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY}
<ACTION>__{Phil walks into the room and pours himself a drink. He slumps onto the couch, takes a sip and closes his eyes. We see movement behind him, as an attractive girl slips through a door and approaches Phil from behind. This is SUSIE, and she puts her hands over his eyes.}
<CHAR>__{SUSIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Guess who?}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Martin Luther King.}
<CHAR>__{SUSIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Try again...}
<ACTION>__{Susie leans over the back of the chair and gives Phil a long slow kiss. She jumps over the couch and resumes kissing, this time more passionately. Phil tries to pull away with little success.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This.... ...isn't.... ...the best time... ...Baby....}
<ACTION>__{Susie continues regardless, Phil is now finding it hard to resist. He eventually gives in, and they begin to kiss passionately.}
<LOC>__{INT. PHIL'S KITCHEN. DAY}
<ACTION>__{Phil and Susie are sitting at the kitchen table.   He takes a drag from her cigarette and passes it back.}
<CHAR>__{SUSIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{How do you know I wasn't?}
<CHAR>__{SUSIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, if you were, you wouldn't have let him die.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I was still 'on staff'. He was still my responsibility.}
<TRANS>__{CON TINUE D:}
<ACTION>__{They sit quietly for a moment.      Then:}
<CHAR>__{PHIL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{So where have you been, anyway?}
<ACTION>__{She sighs, and stands up.}
<CHAR>__{PHIL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{How long this time? Two weeks?}
<CHAR>__{SUSIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, let's have this conversation again. Like you haven't just done six weeks on the road...}
<CHAR>__{PHIL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, but I usually leave a note. And there's a paycheck involved.}
<ACTION>__{Susie disappears through the door. Phil's shoulders sag and he slumps against the wall. Then Susie reappears with a bottle of Jack Daniels and a couple of glasses. She pours out two generous measures and hands one to Phil.}
<CHAR>__{SUSIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come here...}
<ACTION>__{After a moment, he gets up and follows her out of the room.}
<LOC>__{INT. PHIL'S SITTING ROOM. DAY}

<CHAR>__{SUSIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This is a remembrance.}

<DIAL>__{He sang country music in a way that it had never been sung before. It was 'country rock', if you like. And it was kinda catchy. At least, the young people seemed to lap it up. It's fair to say that when Gram Parsons died, he died a star.}

While many of America's young people are today in mourning, their parents will view this as another example of how today's drug culture can so easily claim a life. We'll leave you tonight with the young man's own words. Gram Parsons wrote a song called 'In My Hour of Darkness', which contains these words: 'In my hour of darkness...'}

<DIAL>__{Hi.}
<ACTION>__{He sits up and stretches. She leans over to kiss him, then stands and starts to tidy. He watches her. She picks up some clothing from near his chair and moves away. He drops another piece of clothing on the same spot. She says nothing and picks it up. He takes a sock off and drops it. It has stopped being a game and started being a statement. She picks the sock up and drops it in his lap. He pushes it back onto the floor. She opens her arms and everything falls to the floor. She walks out of the room and into the kitchen. He follows.}

We can clearly see 'New Orleans Taxi' marked on the door.}
