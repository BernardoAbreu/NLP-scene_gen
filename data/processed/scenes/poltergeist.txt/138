<L>__{interior staircase upstairs night}
<A>__{dr. lesh, ryan, steven and diane. tangina barrons is in the lead, outdistancing everyone.}
<L>__{interior hallway outside children’s bedroom door night}
<A>__{everybody crowds around. tangina turns to steve, her breathing coarse with phlegm and wheezing.}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{open it.}
<A>__{this time steve doesn’t hesitate. he has the key already in the lock and swings open the door.}
<L>__{interior children’s bedroom night}
<A>__{it is like a storm at sea inside. so much destroyed minutia speeds through the air it is not unlike a blizzard at night. the sound is a chorus of moaning; and raving.}
<B>__{a vocal asylum from a black place where all souls wait for transit.}
<A>__{a cacophony of music reverberates throughout. nothing specific, only madness and nonsense.}
<L>__{into this wall of noise and torment tangina barrons appears.}
<A>__{she looks around the room, squinting in the low in blowing dust and particles. things, objects, plasma globules fly at her. she sees... the closet. the light is there! it is so bright there is no looking into it without retinal damage. great blue yellow shards of light spill into the room, defined by the thick atmosphere.}
<C>__{tangina}
<P>__{(screaming to be heard)}
<D>__{ryan! get downstairs and wait by the target!}
<A>__{a heavy section of lamp hurls from the other side of the room right for tangina’s head. just as it reaches her it slows down to a winsome “hover” and falls to the floor at her feet.}
<C>__{tangina}
<P>__{(top of her lungs to be heard)}
<D>__{steven! give me the tennis ball marked number one.}
