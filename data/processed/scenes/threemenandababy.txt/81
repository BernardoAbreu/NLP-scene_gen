<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{what the hell is going on around here? what happened to this place? what happened to my room?}
<A>__{peter and michael look him right in the eye, still rocking the basket.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and anyway, what the hell are you swinging that thing for?}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm giving you one more chance to...}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(very calmly)}

<D>__{and that's another thing! i will not have a baby in this house! babies are not part of our agreement!}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{michael, please hold me back... or i will kill him.}
<A>__{michael takes the basket handle from peter's hand, places the basket carefully on the bed, and walks without a word towards jack, who he takes by the arm and steers into the living room. peter softly shuts the door behind them and follows.}
