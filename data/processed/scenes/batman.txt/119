<D>__{i meant to ask you. up on the roof how did you know my name?}
<A>__{batman smiles in response. vicki smiles with him.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{i'm serious. how did you know?}
<A>__{no reply. vicki frowns, looks through the windshield, and sees much to her horror an enormous sheer cliff wall}
<B>__{looming dead ahead.}
<A>__{wide eyed, she looks at batman. still smiling, he hits the gas speeding up. she lets out a scream.}
<B>__{angle on cliff wall}
<A>__{one second to impact. suddenly the cliff wall vanishes altogether revealing, in its place, the gaping mouth of}
<B>__{an underground cavern.}
<A>__{the batmobile zooms through. a moment later, the cliff wall which is nothing more than a holographic projection winks back into existence, showing no trace of the cavern.}
