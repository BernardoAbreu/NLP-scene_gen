<L>__{interior goth store night}
<A>__{drake enters. the store is crowded with low end junky goods that might appeal to tourists visiting hollywood boulevard. a pallid, goth guy cashier sits behind a counter, eating from a takeout container. he's wafer thin, with a detached attitude. a snot. further back is a sultry goth vixen. behind them, on a tv, a cartoon is playing. an animated vampire cavorts "little bit" (like the hot stuff devil from ritchie rich comicbooks)}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{in the window you sell vampire merchandise?}
<A>__{goth guy looks up, wiping his mouth with a napkin. doesn't want to engage with drake at all.}
<C>__{goth guy}
<D>__{uh, yeah look around, we might have a few things.}
<A>__{he and the goth vixen have a snicker at drake's expense. then she tries to be a little more helpful.}
<C>__{goth vixen}
<D>__{we've got dracula lunchboxes. did you see those? and there're bobbleheads, pez dispensers. we've got just about anything }
<P>__{(selecting a vampire shaped vibrator, playful)}
<D>__{ even vampire vibrators.}
<A>__{as drake looks around, what he sees matches his ascending rage. costumes, candles, vampire christmas ornaments. posters from different films nosferatu, lugosi, lee then love at first bite and the little vampire.}
<C>__{goth vixen}
<D>__{here, check this out }
<A>__{she reaches into a case, pulling out a soft drink. the label reads: "dra cola" and has a stylized vampire on it.}
<C>__{goth vixen}
<D>__{"dracola". makes you want to cry, doesn't it?}
<A>__{drake just stares at the can. his mind seems to have retreated elsewhere. back through the ages.}
<C>__{goth vixen}
<D>__{was there something special you needed?}
<A>__{drake doesn't respond. a kind of melancholy has settled over him. he's an outsider now. the world has moved on.}
<D>__{goth guy hey, guy, she's talking to you.}
<A>__{drake looks up as goth guy pours a bowl of count chocula.}
