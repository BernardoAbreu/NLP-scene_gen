<A>__{hold on an empty 2' x 1' x 6" balsa wood box set on a dirty linoleum floor. ancient hands line the balsa wood box with bricks of putty gray plastic explosive. we immediately notice the right hand is missing the index and middle fingers. the hands insert bright red blasting caps into the explosives, lengths of detonating wire emanating from each cap. another set of stronger, younger, in tact hands gently pours a mixture into the box now. ball bearings, children's jacks, marbles, razor blades, roofing nails. everything malevolent densities and angles. some pieces bounce out, run along the floor. the younger hands then start pressing molding the pieces of soon to be shrapnel into the putty gray plastic explosives.}
