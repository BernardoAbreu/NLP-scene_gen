<A>__{the sky is pure blue, exquisitely blemished by huge cumulus clouds, floating lazily. a single bird sails past. from the sky the camera moves to earth. here, too, all is tranquil. the trees, bright green in the sunlight, move only to the slight but constant breeze. now the camera moves down, revealing a wagon to which is hitched a team of horses beside the road. the wagon is at an awkward angle, but upright. it is wedged between two rocks where the horses have pulled it as they tried to reach some forage. its seat is empty. in the bed of the wagon several sacks lie, bearing the legend:}
<D>__{from: argus mine rock pass to: u.s. assay office san francisco}
<A>__{the sacks are empty and slashed as by a knife. the ropes that bound them are cleanly severed. the disorder in the wagon indicates haste. two horses are hitched to it, munching grass or the high leaves of a tree overhead. all that is odd or unnatural is that the reins have fallen askew and trail the ground. now the camera moves away and along tracks made by the wagon when it left the road. on the road two horses stand. these are saddled, but riderless. the rifle holsters are empty. camera moves to the ground. there on the road lies the rifle. the dust is slightly blowing across it, moved by the persistent summery little breeze. from the rifle, the camera moves on a little and stops abruptly on the sprawled dead figure of a soldier, then another, face down in the road. close shot of the dead soldiers, as the camera holds on them. near the hand of one a revolver lies, the fine dust coating it. dust blowing over the uniforms, as though seeking to hide the shame of a murder. as it blows over their still figures, the sound of birds coming over:}
<T>__{fade out: fade in:}
<A>__{rock pass night this is a western mining town of the eighties that has mushroomed up around a gold strike. on the streets prospectors and miners mingle with merchants. as the camera picks up the scene, a lumber wagon passes, bearing logs, a ten team wagon, its trailer filled with ore from the stamp mills and bearing the legend: argus mine. a stage coach comes in as we:}

<L>__{interior hotel night}
<A>__{on the hotel clerk, as he sits behind the desk, playing a guitar and singing pensively the ballad of the story. as he sings, john haven, newly arrived on the stagecoach, walks in, gazes at the clerk with a slight smile, finding the clerk completely indifferent to the arrival of anybody, at last leaves the bag and saunters out.}
<T>__{dissolve:}
<L>__{exterior saloon night}
<A>__{as haven leaves the hotel and has reached the saloon, a well lighted, plush looking spot, illumined by kerosene flares. sticking a pipe in his mouth, haven saunters in.}
<L>__{interior charlie's saloon evening}
<A>__{it is a huge elaborate room, lit by overhead chandeliers. a long mahogany bar runs the length of it. to one side there is a big stove and the gambling tables. beyond can be seen pool tables in an alcove. to another side, a man grinds away at a piano. a stairway near the end of the bar leads to an upper floor. the place is crowded and noisy with people. haven saunters towards the dice table, pauses, watches; he is looking the crowd over carefully missing no detail of the place or the people in it. when his turn comes, he picks up the dice, bets all over the place on the line, on the odds, on the seven, then on the come, the hard way, etc. his point is eight.}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{eight the hard way! pay the line!}
<A>__{haven bets again, doubling all over the table.}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{seven a winner.}
<A>__{players glance at the newcomer. prince appears from nowhere, standing behind the stickman, watching. prince is slender, black haired, handsome and impassive. haven throws again. stellman, an army officer, watches curiously. there is a little rising murmur as haven tosses another natural. he does it without enthusiasm or any lost movement. the bettors get down on him. prince touches the stickman's arm; the man stands aside and prince takes his place with the stick. prince tosses the dice back to haven. haven's eyes are fixed on him. with a little smile, haven throws the dice to the next man, picks up his winnings.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{no, thanks...}
<A>__{his eyes meet prince's again and then he turns away, prince's gaze following him curiously, stellman looks at prince.}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{know him?}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{no. why?}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{he just seems kind of free with that money.}
<A>__{camera follows haven, as still smiling slightly, he heads towards the bar, searching the faces of the crowd as he goes. two miners are squared off for a fight and haven, going his way, walks between them, very indifferent, not even glancing back at the sound of scuffle behind him. at the bar haven alone is not watching the fight. all the others have turned to see it; even the barman is busy watching. but haven's eyes are resting on the figure of a woman now at the piano, singing. softly, as if to herself and for her own enjoyment. he is near the end of the bar and near the piano, and since no one else listens to her at this moment, she sings, half smiling, directly for him, and then, self consciously, she stops and turns to sit at a table, as haven watches her. behind them the fight is being stopped and charlie's eyes follow the huge bouncer, mick marion, as he drags the offenders out to the door and the street. all is as usual. the bartender is back at work. as haven turns, he finds that the place beside him is now occupied by the young lieutenant (phil stellman). haven glances at the uniform, then at the pleasant face of the officer, as the barman comes up.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(to barman)}
<D>__{whiskey like you'd pour it for yourself.}
<A>__{a girl sidles up to him, blonde, brash and pretty.}
<C>__{blonde}
<D>__{don't you know it's no fun to drink alone?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{not till after the first one.}
<A>__{he turns his back to her; she gives him a look and saunters off. the barman produces the drinks a beer for stellman, the young officer. the barman folds his arms. stellman looks at haven.}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{you a stranger here?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(to barman, after}
<D>__{gulping it in one}
<P>__{gulp)}
<D>__{what kind of whiskey was that?}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{on the bottle it says rye but the way you take it, i don't see what difference it makes.}
<A>__{haven smiles at him.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{another rye.}
<A>__{the barman turns to get it. stellman is still looking at haven.}
<C>__{stellman}
<P>__{(easily)}
<D>__{you didn't answer my question.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i'm a stranger everywhere.}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{got a job?}
<A>__{the barman gives haven another rye.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{listen, soldier. i know that one, too. got a job, stranger? no? why don't you join the army? three meals a day, a place to sleep, a nice warm uniform }
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{it has a little more than that.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(deliberately)}
<D>__{yeah, it has one thing more, and that's what i could never take }
<P>__{(looking at stellman's stripes)}
<D>__{it's got second lieutenants.}
<A>__{the barman, listening, senses trouble and signals with his eyes to a big bouncer down the bar. the bouncer moves up quietly.}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{if you want to make it a personal matter }
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{i don't make it anything, soldier. you tried to sell something and i didn't buy it so why don't you just beat it?}
<A>__{they stare at each other for a long second, then stellman speaks icily:}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{if i weren't in uniform, i might teach you some manners.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{if you could teach me anything, you wouldn't be in a uniform.}
<A>__{stellman's jaw tightens; then he turns and exits abruptly. the barman sighs with relief; the bouncer turns away.}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{you couldn't be looking for trouble, could you?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i could, but i'm not.}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{that's fine, because this is one of the best places west of the atlantic ocean to find it.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{that was my first impression.}
<C>__{barman}
<P>__{(as haven looks at him)}
<D>__{that lieutenant's a nice young boy.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i don't doubt it, but his mouth is too big like your ears.}
<A>__{he turns away from the bar, after flipping a coin on to it, while the barman stands there not knowing whether to be angry or philosophical. camera follows haven, as he threads his way through the tables towards the door. his eyes catch sight of the girl who sang at the piano, charlie. she is sitting at a table with prince. prince murmurs to her and she glances at haven, then looks away again. haven notes it. as he comes near the table, the blonde who spoke to him at the bar, accosts him again.}
<C>__{blonde}
<D>__{how is it now?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{blonde}
<D>__{drinking alone?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(flipping her a coin)}
<D>__{it's all right try it.}
<A>__{haven is looking at charlie. she is checking a stack of coins the blonde has turned in to her. she glances up with a fleeting smile at haven.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's not a good habit if it makes you pick fights.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{only with second lieutenants.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we like second lieutenants here.}
<A>__{their gazes meet and prince notes it with narrowing eyes. the gaze holds like a spell, and then charlie's smile comes back, from nowhere.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you see here everybody fights, except the army.}
<A>__{haven looks at her, fascinated. she can feel a fascination herself. now haven smiles a little.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i wouldn't know }
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(still smiling)}
<D>__{so anyone who doesn't like the army }
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i know what you mean, but i'm afraid i will have to come back. i like the way you sing.}
<A>__{she looks at him in a second's silence. haven turns and leaves. she watches him go. prince studies her face, his own grim. a croupier comes up and places a paper before her. she hardly notices it.}
<C>__{croupier}
<D>__{okay, charlie?}
<A>__{charlie snaps out of it long enough to initial the paper.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's his limit.}
<C>__{croupier}
<D>__{there's a sucker getting hot with the dice at ed's table.}
<A>__{he turns away. prince sits still, his eyes on charlie, his slim fingers at an habitual trick, that of idly stacking dice in a little pillar and then picking the pillar aloft by holding the lowest dice pinched between the thumb and forefinger, not by the edges, but by the sides. now he does it as he watches charlie's face. her eyes glance again at the disappearing back of haven. the sense of fascination seems to have gotten her, too. then she realizes the presence of prince and his shrewd gaze. she looks at him coolly.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well cool him off.}
<A>__{prince flips the dice into his palm and rises...}
<L>__{exterior outskirts of town night}
<A>__{the board sidewalk has given way to a rutty dirt road. now the racket of the saloon street is just a ghost of noise, the road dark and silent. haven has emerged from the saloon. he glances up the street. fifty yards ahead, stellman is walking slowly. stellman pauses, shoots a quick glance backwards, then goes on. haven follows, going leisurely up the street after stellman. angle on a corner as stellman turns it, pauses and waits. when haven reaches it, stellman goes on in silence.}
<L>__{exterior mrs. caslon's mine cabin night}
<A>__{as stellman reaches it, pauses and glances behind him. then he rings a bell. haven comes up and waits in silence, glancing at the dark interior. a woman's face now peers through the door window and then the door opens. stellman enters quickly and haven follows.}
<L>__{interior mrs. caslon's mine cabin night}
<A>__{as stellman and haven follow mrs. caslon to a rear door. looking around, haven notes in the shadows a desk and in a corner the big safe. (this room is described in a subsequent scene.) so as to emit the least light, mrs. caslon lets stellman and haven go through, then quickly follows them and quickly shuts the door.}
<L>__{interior mrs. caslon's living room night}
<A>__{it is remarkably neat and elegant inside. as haven, glancing around, pauses inside, he finds himself facing a burly uniformed cavalry officer, captain's bars gleaming on the side of his collar. the captain is big and broad and scowling. he is standing by the fireplace and his eyes are boring into haven's with curiosity and perhaps, suspicion. stellman steps forward as haven and the captain are measuring each other.}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{captain iles the commanding officer of the post.}
<A>__{haven gives a casual nod.}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{mr. haven sir.}
<A>__{iles looks him up and down. haven hands him an envelope which he slips into his tunic without removing his gaze from haven.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{i see you finally got here.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{i seem to finally get everywhere.}
<A>__{they eye each other, iles scowling, haven thinly smiling. the sense of conflict is already between them.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(introducing)}
<D>__{mrs. caslon, mr. haven.}
<A>__{she nods and smiles warmly.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{you've met mr. stellman.}
<A>__{haven nods.}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{it came off beautifully. he picks a very good fight. in fact, i think i'm still a little sore at him.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(grunting)}
<D>__{sit down, mr. haven.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{thank you, captain.}
<A>__{he sits down. iles is still studying haven.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{so you're operating under sealed orders.}
<A>__{haven nods agreeably.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(disgruntled)}
<D>__{all this mumbo jumbo is characteristic of the military information department.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{we use it as sparingly as possible.}
<A>__{iles pulls out a cigar, lights it, sizing haven up.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{i've been in this territory for a number of years and i think it might be a little rougher here than a suburb of washington, d.c.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{very possibly.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{then why is m.i.d. sending you out here?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{because two soldiers have been murdered.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{and they think i can't handle that?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{they merely know you haven't.}
<A>__{there is a tight little silence, while iles formulates his dislike for this newcomer.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{i have only ninety four men on the post, with indian trouble up north. the war department has refused to send reinforcements, or am i boring you?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(looking bored)}
<D>__{i'm not the war department.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(explaining)}
<D>__{the two soldiers were killed while escorting one of the gold stages.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{is escorting gold a function of your command?}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{young man, the functions of my command look very pretty on paper, but they're not very practical in a territory like this. do you have any illusions about that?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i have no illusions about anything.}
<A>__{haven takes out his pipe and fills it.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{what's happening to the gold?}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{i've permitted it to be stored in a warehouse on the post. now everybody is waiting to see what i do nexterior}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{what do you do next?}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(with sarcasm)}
<D>__{aren't you here to tell me?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(lighting the pipe)}
<D>__{captain, you're in a bad way.}
<P>__{(going over to discard the match)}
<D>__{wells fargo won't convoy gold. you tried and failed and two men are dead. the gold is piling up on the post and you can't move it. your post is under manned. you want the quartermaster at platte to replace seventy uniforms sent to the freight office at west rim city }
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{the freight building burned down with the uniforms! i'm not operating a fire department and if i was, west rim city is sixty miles away!}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{that doesn't concern me either.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{what does?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{the killing of two soldiers.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{they were my men, haven, and i'm trying every way i know to find out who murdered them.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{so will i.}
<A>__{for the first time iles looks amicably at him, as though realizing that after all the man isn't there to criticize him.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{you'll find it harder than you think. i don't know how you operate, but it's a dangerous job that can get you killed.}
<A>__{he smiles slightly at iles, who gives him a slight smile in return, somehow intrigued by this nonchalance. haven rises from the chair, lighting the dead pipe in vain.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{perhaps i can get some help from the sheriff.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{you can forget him. he's a miserable man that somebody is using to keep the law a joke.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you make it sound very difficult. why don't you just wrap up your flag and take it back east with you?}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(smarting)}
<D>__{tell me, how will i know what you're doing?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i will let you know from time to time.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{that's very obliging of you.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{but i don't want to visit the army post.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{then report to me through mrs. caslon here. you can be a friend of her husband's. he owned the argus mine and died last year. if that meets your approval.}
<A>__{haven glances at mrs. caslon, smiles back at iles.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{only if it meets with hers.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{i'd be delighted to help.}
<P>__{(she smiles at haven)}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(grim at the smile)}
<D>__{is that all?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i think so.}
<A>__{iles marches out abruptly, followed by stellman. the door shuts. haven smiles after him, then at mrs. caslon.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{he really isn't that abrupt he }
<A>__{the door opens again, smartly, iles marches back in, kisses mrs. caslon on the cheek.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{goodnight, mary.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<P>__{(warmly)}
<D>__{goodnight, george.}
<A>__{then he marches out again, shutting the door after him.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{you see?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{i think he secretly likes you.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{he's a man who can sure keep a secret.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{would you like a little sherry?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{only if you have some too.}
<A>__{she goes over to a sideboard and pours a little from a decanter into two wine glasses. haven watches her. for the first time he realizes she is a very attractive woman. she smiles as she brings him the wine.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{to your good luck.}
<A>__{haven nods and they sip.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{what mine did the two soldiers try to convoy the gold from?}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{my mine the argus.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(smiling a little)}
<D>__{that brings me to a question i decided not to ask.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<P>__{(smiling back at him)}
<D>__{then i will answer it first. captain iles has asked me to marry him.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i can understand that.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{but you can't understand why captain iles should be involved in the gold business.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i do now.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{it isn't just mine. you must realize there's a lot of gold from all over the territory stored at the post warehouse.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{how much.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{perhaps as much as half a million.}
<P>__{(worried now)}
<D>__{in fact, i have about fifty thousand in my safe now.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{who is doing all this?}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{i don't know... that's the worst part of it... not knowing.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(puts down the glass,}
<D>__{pats her shoulder with casual}
<P>__{reassurance)}
<D>__{i might find out.}
<A>__{he starts for the door and she follows him. at the open door he pauses.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{don't get into trouble }
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{that's why i'm here.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{i know, but }
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{don't worry about it. trouble and i are old enemies. we understand each other.}
<P>__{(he grins at her)}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<P>__{(smiling again)}
<D>__{good luck.}
<A>__{haven walks out and she closes the door thoughtfully and turns away. in a moment the door opens and haven reenters and crosses to her much in the manner that we have seen captain iles do so. haven stops.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you didn't tell me your husband's name.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{ben.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(repeating it)}

<A>__{as haven enters the small dismal lobby, and goes over to the desk, where a little man, orville weekly sits, singing to himself softly and strumming an accompaniment on a battered guitar. as haven stands there the clerk finishes the verse about the stranger. haven nods approval. the clerk looks at him shrewdly.}
<C>__{orville}

<D>__{day, week, month?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i don't always know. and the way you talk a man couldn't be very sure.}
<C>__{orville}
<D>__{then it's eight bucks, cash in advance.}
<A>__{haven puts down the money; the clerk spins the registry to him, watches as haven signs it. and he can read that way.}

<D>__{from arizona, huh?}

<D>__{the most in town.}

<A>__{haven senses now it is a little game they're playing together on him. his smile remains. he reaches for the bottle, his hand grasping the base of it, just as mick reaches for it too, clenching the top. mick lifts at it; haven's hand holds. they look at each other as this little game of strength goes on.}
<C>__{mick}

<A>__{that does it. mick wrenches at the bottle, and as he does so, haven releases his grip. the bottle shoots up. the wine spills over mick's face and clothes. infuriated, mick flings the bottle at haven, but haven ducks as he comes out of the chair. the bottle crashes against the wall, and haven's fist crashes against mick. the big man grunts and staggers back, but he doesn't drop. as haven sets himself, he is suddenly pinned from behind by two bouncers. mick stands still, staring at him, his cut lip bleeding.}

<D>__{don't miss so much. you'll got tired.}
<A>__{mick misses again, fiercely and haven cracks him one in the midriff. then steps out fast and waits. mick charges and haven catches him full in the mouth. it stops mick, and then haven socks him again, this time with the butt of his hand open palm on the nose. mick is surprised, tasting the blood on his hurt lips. angle on charlie, mark and prince, as they watch. charlie's eyes are fixed with a kind of admiration on haven. prince watches without interest. mark is tense and excited.}

<C>__{mick}
<D>__{stand still and fight.}
<A>__{as mick closes again, haven stops quickly to one side, clipping him behind the ear as he goes by. but this time mick keeps after haven and finally connects. it is more of a push than a clean hit, but even so the force of it drives haven off balance and he sprawls on his back. as mick, sensing victory, charges, haven knows he can't get to his feet in time, so he turns his body and springs at mick's knees shoulder first. the impact spills mick on his face; before he can recover, haven dives on him, hands flat on his own chest and palms turned out. his body crashes heavily, angling across mick's head, and haven's savagely pushing hands mash the other man's face into the hard ground. then he rolls clear and comes to his feet, breathing easily, waiting. mick gets up, shaking his head to clear it, mad and hurt. as he closes ponderously in on haven, his booted foot suddenly shoots out. haven twists his knee cap away but takes the blow on the inside of his thigh, numbing the leg so that he almost goes down. and now mick gets to him. his great arms close around haven's waist, his hands locked in the small of haven's back. haven braces himself against the crushing squeeze, tensing his back muscles and stiffening his spine, but there is nothing he can do against the implacable brute power of the other man. the sweat stands out on haven's face as mick's great strength bends him over farther and farther. he must do something, and soon, or his back will be cracked like a barrel stave. suddenly he bends his knees and lifts his feet up from off the ground. mick, suddenly finding haven's full weight pulling him forward, crashes down on top of him. with all the strength left in him, haven brings his knee to the pit of mick's stomach; as mick's hold breaks, haven rolls clear. now they are both hurt. haven's ribs and chest are so bruised that it is agony to take a breath. he knows it has to end quickly or he is done for, and he goes all out. as mick tries to close with him again, he stands his ground and throws pile driver punches to mick's midsection; as mick finally lowers his arms to cover his body, haven shifts his attack to the face. this is not mick's style of fighting, but as he lashes back clumsily and angrily, each time he touches haven it is with punishing power. toe to toe, they slug it out, the belt now unwound and dangling from mick's fist, both men groggy but both refusing to go down. finally mick is helpless to protect himself, but haven hasn't got power left to knock him off those sturdy legs. gathering himself, haven hurls his body shoulder first at mick's chest but he miscalculates, glances off and falls flat on his face. as he rolls over, dogged and slow with exhaustion, he sees that his weight has staggered mick; the big man has taken a step back, and now he starts to walk forward. dazed and blind with pain, he passes haven, staggers forward until the tie rail stops him. there he stands, his hands on the rail, moving his head from side to side like a wounded animal. the crowd is silent now, waiting. haven gets to his feet, drunk with weariness. he puts a hand on mick's shoulder, but hasn't the strength to whirl him around. he braces himself with one hand against the tie rail, and almost in slow motion pulls mick around and clips him one last time with his remaining strength. mick goes down.}

<D>__{somebody just did.}
<A>__{they pick up mick as haven stupidly watches. then as haven turns and goes away, swaying and weak, the roar rises. he pushes aside people who try to assist him. they move aside and watch him leave. the crowd goes back in the saloon behind the vanquished mick... angle on charlie, bristow and prince. prince watches the beaten mick go by with a smile of contempt. charlie's eyes are fixed on the vanishing lonely figure of haven. mark's eyes are dancing.}
