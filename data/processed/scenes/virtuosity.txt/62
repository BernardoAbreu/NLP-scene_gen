<B>__{inside the shopping mall}
<A>__{the place is a sevenstory mecca of shopping. an atrium allows you to look from the ground floor up to the seventh. sid 6.7 rushes up the escalators. going up to the second floor. then the third. parker follows suit climbing escalator after escalator. throwing people out of his way.}
<B>__{on the seventh floor}
<A>__{which is also the highest, sid 6.7 veers out of view. parker races up the final steps to the seventh floor. sid 6.7 is nowhere to be seen. parker searches methodically. efficiently. he finally spots sid 6.7. who has parker's head lined up perfectly in his gun sight. parker is a sitting duck. boom! parker dives behind affluent shopper 2.1, who takes a bullet in his ascot. parker quickly grabs him, and uses his body as a shield against sid 6.7's constant gunfire until parker arrives behind a marble column.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<P>__{(surprised at parker's ruthlessness)}
<D>__{we really aren't that different, are we?}
<A>__{what he cannot see is that behind the column, affluent shopper 2.1 is auto resetting. parker puts his gun to the shopper's head.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{don't move, and don't make a sound. got it?}
<A>__{affluent shopper 2.1 nods his head repeatedly. parker collects himself behind the column, then pivots out from behind it. firing in sid 6.7's direction. each bullet finds its mark. absorbing the blows, sid 6.7 backs up against the atrium railing. taking one final shot, he falls backward. over the railing. parker's pov sid 6.7 tumbles through the atrium. out of control. speeding toward the ground seven floors below. sid 6.7's pov the sense of momentum is exhilarating. and terrifying. if you get dizzy easily, close your eyes.}
<B>__{from the first floor}
<A>__{sid 6.7 falls through the atrium like a rock directly at you. a 200 pound rock. wham!!! he lands face down in the marble floor. the impact is bone crushing. sid 6.7 does not move. until he begins to regenerate. his fluids begin returning to his body. his bones regaining proper form. within seconds, his body appears as good as new. (technically, because this is vr1 the proper term would be auto. reset. but since sid 6.7 thinks he's in the real world, regenerating is what he thinks he's doing.) sid 6.7 stands, dusting himself off.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{man, what a rush.}
<P>__{(yelling up to parker)}
<D>__{adios, amigo!}
<A>__{grabbing his gun, he takes off out of the lobby.}
<B>__{on the seventh floor}
<A>__{parker retrieves his gun, then bolts down the escalators.}
