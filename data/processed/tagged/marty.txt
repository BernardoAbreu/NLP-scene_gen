<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{just east of webster avenue in the north bronx, 187th street is a predominantly italian community and the commercial avenue of the neighborhood. fruit and vegetable stands, pizzerias, butcher shops, bakeries, cleaners and dyers and bars flourish. it is saturday morning around eleven o'clock a market day. women, dark, gesticulative, with bulging cloth shopping bags, baby carriages. merchants at their improvised street stands, hawking their wares, disputing with their customers, roaring salutations to passersby. in the midst of all this, camera homes in on a typical neighborhood...}
<B>__{butcher shop.}
<A>__{delicatessens hang on the walls, wreathed with garlands of garlic. patsy, the boss, a swarthy man of sixty, is flopping a chunk of beef onto the scale for the benefit of a forty year old matron. there are three or four other women in the shop, all talking to one another. a four year old boy lazily chases a cat. the white refrigerator room door opens, and a second butcher, marty pilletti, comes out carrying a large leg of lamb. marty is a mildmannered, short, stout, balding man of thirty four. his charm lies in an almost indestructible good humor. he drops the leg of lamb onto the chopping block, reaches up for the cleaver hanging with the other utensils over the block and makes quick incisive cuts into the leg of lamb. he sets the cleaver aside, picks up the saw to finish the cuts as he chats with his customer, mrs. fusari.}
<C>__{mrs. fusari}
<D>__{your kid brother got married last sunday, eh, marty?}

<D>__{well, the last time i was up here, that's where i sat. i sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. i will never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. then i began to cry, and i had to get up and go home.}

<C>__{marty}
<D>__{now i figure, two people get married, and they gonna live together forty, fifty years. so it's just gotta be more than whether they're good looking or not. you tell me you think you're not very good looking. my father was a really ugly man, but my mother adored him. she told me that she used to get so miserable sometimes, like everybody, you know? and she says my father always tried to understand. i used to see them sometimes when i was a kid, sitting in the living room, talking and talking, and i used to adore my old man, because he was so kind. that's one of the most beautiful things i have in my life, the way my father and mother were. and my father was a real ugly man. so it doesn't matter if you look like a gorilla. so you see, dogs like us, we ain't such dogs as we think we are.}

<D>__{...when i got outta the army, clara, i was lost. i didn't know what i wanted to do. i was twenny five years old, what was i gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. i thought maybe i go to college under the g.i. biller rights, you know? but i wouldn't graduate till i was twenny eight, twenny nine years old, even if i made it in three years. and my brother freddie wanted to get married, and i had three unmarried sisters in an italian home, that's a terrible thing. and my kid brother nickie, he's a one got married last week. so i just went to pieces. i used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. my mother used to be so worried about me. my uncle mario come over one time. he offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. he got his own cab, you know. and god forgive me for what i'm gonna say now, but i used to thinka doing away with myself. i used to stand sometimes in the subway, and god forgive me what i'm going to say, i used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.}

<C>__{clara}
<D>__{there's nothing wrong with being a butcher.}

<D>__{i don't.}
<A>__{marty looks quickly up at her, then back down.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{well, the point is mr. gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to california in los angeles and live near their married daughter. because she's always writing them to come out there. so it's a nice little shop. i handle his books for him, so i know he has a thirty five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. the point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. there's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an a&p coming in, at least that's the rumor. of course, mosta his trade is strictly italian, but the younger italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old italian dishes so much. i mean, you gotta take that into account too.}

<D>__{it's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, marty.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{that's true. i do. but i'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. that's a big note to carry, because i have to give mr. gazzara a mortgage, and what i have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than i can make onna salary?}
<A>__{clara looks down at her fingers, her face alive and sensitive. she carefully assembles her words in her mind. then she looks at the squat butcher across the table from her.}
<C>__{clara}

<C>__{clara}
<D>__{couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?}

<C>__{clara}
<D>__{well, i don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, i don't think a mother in law should live with a young couple.}
<C>__{mrs. pilletti}

<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.}
