<A>__{cruising up park avenue. a panel slides open next to the bar with a portable computer on it. a television is turned on to the evening news, a low hum of voices. gekko punches into the keyboard of the computer. a name appears an the screen... lawrence wildman with curriculum vitae following; address, phones, businesses...}

<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(amused, cold hatred)}
<D>__{sir larry wildman. like all brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole rdl pharmaceuticals right out from under me. wildman the white knight.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{i remember that deal. you were involved?}
<A>__{gekko shuts off the computer and slides it back into the housing, his eyes taking in the low volume news.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.}
<P>__{(looking out suddenly)}
<D>__{... see that building? i bought into it ten years ago. it was my first real estate deal. i sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. it was better than sex. at that time i thought that was all tne money in the world...}
<P>__{(drinks)}
<D>__{now, it's a day's pay ... i had a mole in wildman's employ. gave me half the picture, then he got fired...}

<P>__{(shaken)}
<D>__{it's not what i do. i could lose my license. if the sec found out, i could go to jail. it's inside information, isn't it?}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(scratches his head wryly)}
<D>__{inside information. oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? or someone overhears me saying i'm gonna buy teldar paper? or the chairman of the board of xyz suddenly knows it's time to blow out xyz. you mean that?}
<P>__{(a piercing look)}
<D>__{i'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and i are gonna have a hard time doing any business...}
<A>__{bud downs the rest of his drink, upset by the darkening mood. there's something very powerful and frighteninq about gekko.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{what about hard work?}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{what about it? you work hard. i will bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. and where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. and he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. and i'm not talking a $200,000 a year working wall street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", i'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50 100 million, a player bud or nothing. you had what it takes to let through my door. next question: you got what it takes to stay...??}
