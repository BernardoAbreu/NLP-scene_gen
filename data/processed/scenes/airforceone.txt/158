<A>__{marshall rips his sleeve off, swabs the blood off his arm. bazylev's bullet took out a good chunk of flesh when it grazed him.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{did they say anything about my family?}
<C>__{v.p. chandler}
<D>__{they're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.}
<A>__{marshall opens a travel bottle of vodka and pours it over the wound. he winces from the pain. v.p chandler i think we're okay, sir. flow that we know you're alive we can force petrov to release stravanavitch. marspari don't tell me you plan to give in to these fuckers. general normwood we plan to do whatever it takes to keep you alive, sir.}
<C>__{v.p. chandler}
<D>__{and if that means negotiating...}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{you know my policy. we don't negotiate with terrorists. if we start now, all of america becomes a target.}
<C>__{v.p. chandler}
<D>__{but this is different, sir. you're the president.}
<B>__{marshall}
<A>__{and what happens when stravanavitch is freed and discovers he's got the president? you think for a second that that crazy bastard is just gonna turn me over? he'll ask for the goddamn moon before he's done.}
<C>__{v.p. chandler}
<D>__{please, mr. president. you're going to get yourself killed. is that your solution?}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{freeing stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. i can't live with that.}
<P>__{(somewhat resigned)}
<D>__{i'm not royalty. i'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the president is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we don't negotitate. not as long as i'm president. is that understood?}
<A>__{a long silence, then...}
<B>__{yes sir. chandler}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{flow, is there a rescue operation under way or not?}
<A>__{lee shakes his head at chandler, signalling "don't tell."}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{he's not on a secure line.}
<A>__{marshalj whoever said that, shut up. walter, are you there?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{i'm here, mr. president.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{where's the cavalry?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{we can't do anything until that plane lands. and when it does land, sir, it's going to be in hostile territory. to be perfectly honest, we don't know what the hell to do.}
<A>__{it's going to take a miracle to figure this one out. a long beat. we hold on marshall's determined face.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{i will see what i can do.}
