<L>__{interior jerry's home office later day}
<A>__{jerry and dorothy prepare for the tidwells, cleaning up the cramped office, unstacking chairs and making room.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{that was great of you this morning.}
<A>__{the tidwells honk, arriving in the driveway.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(friendly, dismissive)}
<D>__{look, let's just root for a big offer so we can move out of this room to a real office.}
<A>__{she feels slightly slapped down, but covers. she opens a window quickly, and busies herself with the clutter at hand.}
<B>__{on fax}
<A>__{connecting.}
<B>__{four faces}
<A>__{waiting for the results. everybody has a stake in this fax. lives are very clearly hanging on this results. marcee shuts her eyes.}
<C>__{marcee}
<D>__{read it to me, and don't say anything unless it's over nine.}
<A>__{there is a stunning disappointment on the fax. jerry's heart sinks. his face slackens.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{aw shit }
<A>__{rod turns away. dorothy shuts her eyes, as marcee opens hers.}
<C>__{marcee}
<D>__{one point seven for three years. that's below average. we owe more than that...}
<A>__{it is so very painful for her, as tidwell slinks off to sit in a seat too small for him.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i will go back to them.}
<C>__{marcee}
<P>__{(explodes)}
<D>__{and say what? "please remove your dick from my ass?!"}
<A>__{both men look at her. the outburst has surprised even marcee.}
<C>__{marcee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm a little pregnant right now.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<D>__{i feel like crying. i feel like breaking the room up.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{okay, we don't take this emotionally. we roll with this problem.}
<C>__{marcee}
<D>__{what are you talking about "don't get emotional." if you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional enough about this man.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{marcee }
<C>__{marcee}
<D>__{what do you stand for???}
<A>__{dorothy looks right and left, can't hold back.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{how about a little piece of integrity in this world that is so filled with greed and a lack of honorability that i don't know what to tell my kid except take a look at a guy who isn't shouting "show me the money," he's quietly broke and working for you for free!}
<P>__{(off jerry's pained look)}
<D>__{well, i'm sorry, i'm not as good at the insults as she is.}
<C>__{marcee}
<D>__{no, that was pretty good.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{no shit.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{in fact, you should read something that meant the world to me...}
<A>__{she opens a drawer, and withdraws the mission statement. she is headed across the room to give it to marcee, when jerry swiftly intercepts it.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{another time, okay dorothy?}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{fine, i just }
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{and i appreciate that impulse.}
<A>__{jerry throws the mission statement into a bottom drawer. camera moves to tidwell, and we see him for the first time without his protective shield of attitude. scared.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<D>__{tell me what to do, jerry. you tell me to eat lima beans, i will eat lima beans.}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{tidwell }
<D>__{if you say take the shitty deal, that's all we can get }
<C>__{marcee}
<D>__{"all we can get?"}
<C>__{tidwell}
<D>__{can i speak with my agent here?}
<A>__{marcee is passionate. focused on rod.}
<C>__{marcee}
<D>__{you know what you're qonna do, rodney. you're gonna reject this shitty contract. you're gonna play out your existihg shitty contract and go be a free agent next year and the hell with arizona. this is us, and we determine our worth. you're a fine, proud, surviving, splendid black man.}
<A>__{beat. truer words... the big man looks into his wife's eyes.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<D>__{honey, you are just }
<A>__{no one else in the world exists. they are focused totally on each other. jerry and dorothy in the background, just watching the intricate machinery of this marriage.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ the shit.}
<A>__{she caresses the back of his neck. he pulls her to him. he gives her a small kiss. dorothy and jerry look at the couple, fascinated and somewhat uncomfortable. there is a palpable forcefield around the tidwells. they are a couple in every passionate sense of the word. after a beat:}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{if you get injured, you get nothing.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<D>__{won't happen. i'm strong in my mind.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{it's a risk.}
<A>__{jerry looks over to dorothy, who grits her teeth at the implications of the decision.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<D>__{bet on me, dude. bet on me like i bet on you.}
<A>__{tidwell puts his hand out. maguire is conflicted, but he takes a breath and shakes.}
