<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{ext apostolic palace day}
<A>__{the back doors of the apostolic palace bang open and langdon is ushered out (fast) by olivetti, the head of the vatican police.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{the archives are this way.}
<A>__{they turn down a narrow passageway. a voice calls from behind them.}
<C>__{vittoria }
<D>__{professor langdon!}
<A>__{vittoria catches up to them.}
<C>__{vittoria }
<D>__{if this path really leads to the church of illumination, that may be where they've hidden the antimatter.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{"a shining star at the end of the path." my thoughts exactly.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<P>__{(to vittoria)}
<D>__{if we find this bomb, can you deactivate it?}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{no, but i can change its battery, as long as it has more than five minutes of life. that would give us another twenty four hours to get it back to cern.}
<A>__{olivetti nods to her, come on along. they walk again, holds a hand out to langdon.}
<C>__{vittoria }
<D>__{vittoria vetra. are you really a symbologist, or was he mocking you?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{both. you're a physicist?}
<C>__{vittoria}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{bio entanglement physics. interconnectivity of life systems.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{what are we looking for in the archives?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{a little book written by galileo.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{galileo was llluminati?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{and a devout catholic. he thought science and religion weren't enemies, but two different languages telling the same story. he wanted like minds to be able to find the church of illumination, but he couldn't exactly advertise its location, so he created a coded path. an unknown llluminati master sculpted four statues, each a tribute to one of the four fundamental elements earth, air, fire, water and put them out in public, in churches throughout rome. each statue held a clue, pointing to the nexterior and at the end of the trail was the church of illumination.}
<A>__{vicenzo, leading them, turns up via sentinel and starts up the hill toward the archives. they follow, quickly.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{what makes you think he's going to murder the cardinals in the churches?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{the llluminati called those four churches by a special name l'altare di scienza. the altars of science.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<P>__{(making the connection)}
<D>__{"sacrifice them on the altars of science," he said.}
<A>__{langdon stops in his tracks.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{oh. oh, wow.}
<A>__{he's staring up at the impressive facade of the vatican archives. he takes a deep breath, then steps forward to enter. but vincenzo doesn't follow. langdon looks at him.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{we go in alone?}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{vatican police aren't allowed access to the archives, only swiss guard. lt. chartrand will meet you inside. i will be here when you're done.}
<A>__{langdon turns back to the archives with a look of deep contentment he's wanted in here for a long, long time. and steps through the double doors.}
