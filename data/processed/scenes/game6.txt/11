<L>__{interior bedroom later}
<A>__{nicky and joanna are undressing after the fact, very slowly and distractedly. joanna stands by a chair near the window. nicky is on the other side of the bed and he alternates between standing and sitting as he takes off his clothes.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{last night. alan albright called me a handsome woman. second time he's done that. son of a bitch.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i hear alan's sick.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{alan's very sick. he has to go to new mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you know about adele.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{what about her?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{she's dying.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{she died.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i talked to her two days ago.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{apparently it didn't help. you know about peter, of course.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{our peter?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{peter redmond. they found out why he can't remember his lines. there's something living in his brain. a parasite he picked up in borneo, doing the movie.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{can he get through it?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{they're watching him closely. there's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. to bolster his confidence. and that's not all.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i've got bigger problems, joanna. personal problems.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{that's not all, nicky. i've been backing your plays for fifteen years. and i've never been more depressed.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{steven schwimmer. the most powerful critic in america gets his first crack at nicky rogan.}
<C>__{nicky}
<P>__{(hiding his concern)}
<D>__{look. all i want is a haircut. i'm not worried about this guy.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{ever since he started reviewing the broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{they can send their heartless brilliant boy critic. there's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{the red sox}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{you mean the world series? i thought the red sox were winning.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{three games to two. but if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. i've been carrying this franchise on my back since i was six years old.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{it can't be all that personal.}
<A>__{joanna enters the walk in closet to finish undressing and get a nightdress.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{if you have a team you've followed all your life, and they raise your hopes and crush them, and lift them and crush them, do you want me to tell you what it's like? it's like feeling your childhood die over and over. j}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{i mean nicky, really, no.}
<A>__{nicky follows her into the closet, still in his shirt and boxer shorts.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{i'm proud of this play. it's so different from anything you've done.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{this is how we've managed to last.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{we're able to surprise each other.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{in and out of bed.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{because we're completely mismatched.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{we don't even like each other, do we?}
<A>__{nicky walks out of the closet, takes off his shirt, gets into bed.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{i used to tell myself. talent is more erotic when it's wasted. will i see you tonight?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{the red sox blow a chance to win their first world series since 1918. you expect me to miss that for an opening night?}
<A>__{joanna emerges from the closet in her nightdress and gets into bed.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{it makes me so mad. steven schwimmer ready to strike. the exterminating angel.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{it's all worked out. they'll lose tonight. then they'll lose tomorrow. i see it with stunning clarity.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{it's your best play, nicky.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{they'll lose because they're my team.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{he will absolutely hate it.}
