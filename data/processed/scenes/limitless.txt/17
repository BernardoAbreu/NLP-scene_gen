<A>__{eddie makes his way home, a little tipsy and filled with self loathing.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{all the way home she was back on my mind ... melissa.}
<A>__{flash! a memory melissa's face as she's talking, laughing.}
<C>__{eddie }

<A>__{melissa, sparkling, beautiful, surrounded by people, in intense conversation with a bunch of downtown types.}

<A>__{the men gasp, shocked and titillated. the women are furious. melissa smiles to herself she's trying not to crack up.}

<D>__{i thought, by now, she'd be curing cancer, directing movies, running for the senate...}
<A>__{we hold on melissa's lovely, confident face as her voice fades down and eddie's fades in.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) what had happened? her life made no sense. i mean, i could see a direct, plausible link between this eddie, broke and buzzed at three o'clock in the afternoon, and an earlier eddie...}
