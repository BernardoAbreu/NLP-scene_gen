<D>__{what about your mother? isn't she worried about you, too?}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{i don't know, listen. you... you're a friend of dr crawford, so you're probably all right, but i will be straight with you, i don't like this already.}
<C>__{dr berger}
<D>__{well, as long as you're straight.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{what do you know about me? have you talked to crawford?}
