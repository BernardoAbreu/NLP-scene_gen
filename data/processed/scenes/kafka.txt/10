<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{outside night kafka resists going along with the others.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{no, really, i have to go home too.}
<C>__{margarete}
<D>__{we're keeping him from his true vocation.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{i know, he consists of writing. we wouldn't be his friends if we didn't threaten his solitude!}
<A>__{julius is a little drunk. the others help him with his coat.}

<A>__{has a private moment with kafka.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{where do you live?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{up there.}
<A>__{he gestures in the direction of the river, and the castle that looms on a far hill beyond, huge and brooding, regally dominating the city.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i tried finding a place on castle hill when i arrived. i wanted to share the majesty.}
<A>__{(the majesty of marriage is what he fears she represents. this innocent scene could very well be a subjective kafkaesque nightmare as sinister in its own way as any of the more outright horrific scenes to come.)}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{it's only majestic from here. when you get closer you see it for what it really is.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what is it really?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{a glorified office block. they keep all the old records there the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well, as long as i admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.}
<A>__{(the castle of marriage tempts him but would suffocate him.)}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{it's more than hollow. it's stillborn. for all its size it serves no purpose. it's just there like death hovering over a breathing city.}
<B>__{the others}
<A>__{turn back into the picture. margarete pats kafka sympathetically.}
<C>__{margarete}
<D>__{don't worry about your friend i'm sure he'll turn up.}
<C>__{ernst}
<P>__{(a parting word)}
<D>__{what are you working on, kafka?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i'm writing a story about a man who wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a giant insect.}
<A>__{his friends glance at each other surreptitiously and don't know what to say other than goodnight}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{turns to go when he notices bizzlebek leaning listlessly in the coffee house doorway. a figure in the shadows.}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{i've read your stories. they're fantastic.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(not sure if he believes him)}
<D>__{i don't know what you could have read.}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{just what you've published.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{ in magazines nobody reads.}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{i read the one about the penal colony.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(cautious)}
<D>__{did you?}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{the needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man.}
<P>__{(looks impressed)}
<D>__{very good.}
<A>__{kafka suspects he's being mocked. but perhaps not. bizzlebek steps out, buttoning his coat.}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{if i could sculpt as well as that, i'd be quite proud of myself.}
<A>__{he's already quite proud of himself tossing his scarf over his shoulder with a flourish and striding off into the night.}
