<A>__{chad is emerging from the basement. he is looking idly around, heading toward the front door when a shape materializes in its frosted glass sidelight. chad freezes. there is scraping at the lock. chad quickly mounts the stairs.}
<L>__{interior cox townhouse second floor day}
<A>__{chad freezes, listening. the downstairs door swings open, shut. footsteps. a tread on the stairs: chad scurries into the first open door.}
<L>__{interior cox townhouse bedroom day}
<A>__{chad hotfoots into a closet and eases its door most of the way shut. the footsteps mount the stairs. chad peeks out. his pov: the bed, bedclothes rumpled. in the middle of the bed, a wedge cushion. beyond, the open bedroom door shows a slice of hallway and stairs. harry arrives at the top of the stairs. he nudges back a drape on the window at the top of the steps. he looks down one way, then the other. he lets the drape fall back and seems to relax. harry enters the bedroom. he strips off his shirt and steps out of his pants on his way into the bathroom off the master bedroom. he leaves the door open. chad reaches gingerly for the closet door to close it but stops abruptly as we hear the shower turned off and the curtain whipped back. harry emerges from the shower. he rinses off, humming "born free," and walks into the foreground pulling on shorts and shirt and a pair of dress pants that was draped across a bureau. chad shrinks back into the closet as harry approaches. harry stops, just outside the cracked door. through the crack we see only the white of his shirt. abruptly harry turns his back to us and recedes into the room and bends to pick something off the floor. chad leans in ever so slightly to see, but draws back again as harry approaches. chad looks over to his right: on a hanger, the brown pinstripe coat that matches harry's pants. the closet door is thrown open.}

<D>__{ahhhhhhhhhh!}
<A>__{harry jerks up the gun which he's pulled from the shoulder holster in his other hand and bam shoots chad in the face. the gun bucks. unused to the recoil and still screaming, harry staggers back and trips over the edge of the bed and drops the weapon. he crabs briefly backward and then flips over and scrambles off on all fours. in the hallway he rises and tramples down the stairs.}
