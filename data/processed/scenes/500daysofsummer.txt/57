<L>__{ext street morning}
<A>__{it's the greatest morning of all time! tom walks down the street. or, more accurately, tom struts down the street. he's pointing at people as he passes, winking, doing a little shuffle. he is the man. he checks out his reflection in a window. a young paul newman stares back. people wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up. a parade forms behind him. the postman, a police officer, the hot dog vendor, ronald mcdonald and mayor mccheese, everybody loves tom today. hall and oates themselves walk with tom singing the song. cars stop at crosswalks to let tom go by. the drivers also pump their fists in celebration of tom's achievement last night. he walks on, the man. we notice the sidewalk lights up every time he touches the pavement like in "billie jean". cartoon birds fly onto tom's shoulder. he smiles and winks at them.}
