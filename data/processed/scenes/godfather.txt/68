<L>__{ext nite: mall, featuring don's house (winter 1945)}
<A>__{the windows of the main house are dark except for the don's study. it stands out against the cold, dark night.}
<L>__{int nite: don's living room (winter 1945)}
<A>__{the living room is empty, save for paulie gatto sitting on the edge of the sofa. the clock reads: 4:00 a.m.}
<L>__{int nite: don's office (winter 1945)}
<A>__{sonny, michael, hagen, clemenza and tessio; all exhausted, in shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep. it is four in the morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many snacks. they can barely talk anymore.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{is the hospital covered?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{the cops have it locked in and i got my people there visiting pop all the time. what about the hit list.}
<A>__{hagen widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{too much, too far, too personal. the don would consider this all purely a business dispute: get rid of sollozzo, and everything falls in line. you don't have to go after the tattaglias.}
<A>__{clemenza nods.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{what about luca? sollozzo didn't seem worried about luca. that worries me.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{if luca sold out we're in real trouble.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{has anyone been able to get in touch with him?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{no, and i've been calling all night. maybe he's shacked up.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{luca never sleeps over with a broad. he always goes home when he's through. mike, keep ringing luca's number.}
<A>__{michael, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the number once again. he can hear the phone ringing on the other end but no one answers. then hangs up.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{keep trying every fifteen minutes.}
<P>__{(exhausted)}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{tom, you're the consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the corleone family loses half its strength. without your father, the other new york families might wind up supporting sollozzo, and the tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war. the old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore. if your father dies...make the deal, sonny.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{that's easy to say; it's not your father.}
<C>__{hagen}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i was as good a son to him as you or mike.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{oh christ tom, i didn't mean it that way.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{we're all tired...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{ok, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead. but tom, i want you to stay inside the mall. you too, mike, no chances. tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city. the hospital is yours; i want it tight, fool proof, 24 hours a day.}
<A>__{there is a timid knock on the door.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{paulie gatto looks in.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{i tol' you to stay put, paulie...}
<C>__{paulie}
<D>__{the guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{tessio, see what it is.}
<A>__{tessio gets up, leaves.}
<C>__{paulie}
<D>__{you want me to hang around?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{yeah. hang around.}
<C>__{paulie}
<D>__{outside?}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{outside.}
<C>__{paulie}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{he closes the door.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{clemenza. you take care of paulie. i don't ever want to see him again. understood?}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{understood.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{okay, now you can move your men into the mall, replace tessio's people. mike, tomorrow you take a couple of clemenza's people and go to luca's apartment and wait for him to show. that crazy bastard might be going after sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{maybe mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly. you know the old man doesn't want that.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{ok forget it, just stay on the phone.}
<A>__{michael is embarrassed to be so protected. he dials luca brasi's number once again. the ring repeats, but no one answers. tessio comes back, carrying luca brasi's bullet proof vest in his hand. he unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped inside.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{a sicilian message: luca brasi sleeps with the fishes.}
