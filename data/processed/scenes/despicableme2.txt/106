<L>__{ext: sky day}
<A>__{as lucy falls from the sky she presses a button on her purse and it transforms into a hanglider. she flies off with purpose.}
<L>__{int: tunnel day}
<A>__{elevator doors open revealing el macho's underground lair. gru stands in the doorway, pulling the dart out of his nose. the lair is a massive villainous complex that looks a lot like hell. gru takes the place in. it's awesome and terrifying. the magnet ship is there!}
<C>__{eduardo }
<D>__{you have not lost your touch, my friend.}
<A>__{gru turns around and sees eduardo dressed in el macho's old wrestling outfit, like we saw in the flashback.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{ha ha! i knew it! you are el macho!}
<C>__{el macho}
<D>__{that's right!}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{nobody believed me! ho ho! but i knew you weren't dead!}
<C>__{el macho}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{of course not. i merely faked my death, ha, ha!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but now it's time for me to make a spectacular return to evil! doctor, i think it's time we showed gru what we're up to here.}
<A>__{standing in the middle of the lair's walkway is the one, the only...dr. nefario.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{dr. nefario?}
<C>__{dr. nefario}
<D>__{nice to see you, gru.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{whaaat? this so, this is your new job opportunity?}
<C>__{dr. nefario}
<D>__{absolutely. you're gonna like this.}
<A>__{dr. nefario pulls a lever. a platform rises with the purple minion version of kevin strapped to a chair on it.}
<C>__{el macho}
<D>__{sorry i had to borrow some of your minions, but it was for a worthy cause.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{oh! kevin? agh!}
<C>__{el macho}
<D>__{no, he's not kevin anymore. now he is an indestructible, mindless killing machine!}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{blah!}
<C>__{el macho}
<D>__{just watch this!}
<A>__{he then presses a button. a machine gun lowers and the purple minion's riddled with bullets, but unhurt. a flamethrower shoots fire at the purple minion, but he's completely unharmed. an axe is swung at him, but he just eats it. an atom bomb falls on him, but he just swallows it and it explodes harmlessly in his belly. a police car is dropped onto him, and he devours it whole. gru stares, stunned.}
<C>__{el macho }
<D>__{and here's the best part! i've got an army of them!}
<A>__{the lights come on above el macho, revealing hundreds of caged purple minions. gru can't believe his eyes. el macho laughs.}
<C>__{el macho }
<D>__{soon i will unleash them on the world and if anyone, anyone, tries to stop them...yeow! their city gets eaten!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we can do it together!}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{together?}
<C>__{el macho}
<D>__{together! i have admired your work for years, amigo. stealing the moon?! are you kidding?! we would be unstoppable! men like you, men like me, we should be ruling the world!}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{so, are you in?}
<A>__{dr. nefario pops a celebratory noisemaker in the background.}
<C>__{dr. nefario}
<D>__{woo hoo!}
<A>__{el macho eagerly awaits gru's reply. gru just stares at him. how does he get out of this?}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{uh...yeah...probably...}
<A>__{el macho is taken aback.}
<C>__{el macho}
<D>__{probably?}
<A>__{gru realizes he's in danger and quickly tries to backpedal.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{i mean, yes! yes. of course, yes, i just have a lot going on right now...i just need to get some things off my plate before we start taking over the world, that's all.}
<C>__{el macho}
<D>__{`scuse me?}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{no no, forget it! one hundred percent! i am in!}
<P>__{(pretending to hear something)}
<D>__{i think what is do you hear that i do. that's agnes calling me from on the surf }
<A>__{gru steps into the elevator and the door shuts. then opens. he's frantically trying to press the button that will return him to the surface.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{totally in!}
<A>__{the doors close and gru is gone. el macho stares, deep in thought. clearly suspicious.}
<C>__{el macho}
<D>__{you know what? i am not so convinced that he is in.}
<A>__{el macho presses a button that releases the purple minion.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{blah!}
