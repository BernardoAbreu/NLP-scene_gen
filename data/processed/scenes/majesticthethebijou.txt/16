<A>__{the full moon is low over the ocean. pete's car is parked at the edge of the sand, the water fifty yards away. the ferris wheel and the roller coaster of the amusement pier are dark and eerie silhouettes, lit only by moonlight. pete is asleep in the driver's seat, head tilted back, his hat covering his face, snoring. the waves crash against the pilings and startle pete awake.}

<D>__{huh? whatsa...}
<A>__{instantly, he grabs his head.}
<C>__{pete's narration }
<D>__{i had no idea how i got to santa monica, but it certainly was a good idea. i don't think i could've faced the headache i had alone in my apartment. at least i had the ocean air.}
<A>__{pete takes a deep breath... and starts coughing. he gets out his cigarettes and lights up. he takes a puff and glances at his watch.}
<C>__{pete's narration }
<D>__{three forty five. i had only been there for a couple of hours at most. truth be told, i was still fairly drunk.}
