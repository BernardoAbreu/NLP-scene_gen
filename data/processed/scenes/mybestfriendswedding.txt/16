<L>__{interior tiffany's morning}
<A>__{julianne and kimmy cruise the stately display cases. everywhere, the tiffany logo, the silent, watchful staff in morning coats. as they browse, julianne takes a blueberry danish from a paper sack, and begins to eat. the staff notices. so does kim.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{it's an homage thing.}
<A>__{hmm?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{awkward girls grow up on audrey hepburn movies. you wouldn't understand.}
<A>__{kimmy doesn't. but wipes a blue glob from julianne's face.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{anyway, i think you're wrong.}
<A>__{wrong?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{what you were saying before.}
<A>__{before?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{about michael's job.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{oh, that. i forgot i even said th...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{i just think you're wrong, is all.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{probably am. forget i brought it up.}
<A>__{points to some jade pins. kimmy wrinkles her nose.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{i mean, he loves his job.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...}
<A>__{smiles.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{what's not to love?}
<A>__{none of this is lost on kimmy. she's wondered the same.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{but he always says...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{... whatever is manly and independent.}
<A>__{kim nods slowly. way ahead of her.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{why would he trade that for running, say, a big piece of the pr at a powerful, complex, challenging conglomerate like your dad's?}
<A>__{kim stares back. a strange look.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{that's just the sort of thing my father and i discussed.}
<A>__{julianne just blinks. amazed.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i'm not stupid. say, how about this?}
<A>__{pointing to tiny golden scissors in the novelty case. kim so absorbed by the main topic, she has to force herself to focus on...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{for the twins? what in the world is th...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{gold nose hair clippers.}
<A>__{points to the tiny hand lettered sign. indeed. kimmy shrugs, not quite it.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{so you don't think michael's as happy with his job as...}
<A>__{julianne points to a matched pair of large...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{gold dog collars? they don't have dogs.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{kim nods, oh. but can't keep her mind off...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{you think he'd accept?}
<A>__{hmm?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{michael. a job like that.}
<A>__{oh, well...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{by any yardstick that involves sanity, it would be the greatest thing that ever happened to him. present company excepted.}
<A>__{kimmy nodding slowly. her yearing achingly apparent.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{on the other hand, he's proud. last thing a man wants to admit, is being trapped in a dispiriting dead end job that can never support a family.}
<A>__{a very sweet smile.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{throw a man a life preserver. he'll say, "thanks, anyway, i'd rather drown."}
<A>__{kim nods again. right. they are so bonded at this moment.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{so... one almost has to...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{exactly what?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{what you said. make it appear that he's doing you the favor.}
<A>__{kimmy bites her lip. her eyes go down. self conscious to admit...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i couldn't really... do that. after, you know...}
<A>__{her voice trails off.}
<P>__{julianne (kind, but wise)}
<D>__{... lying. all the time.}
<A>__{that brings the gray eyes up. julianne bats her dark ones...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{oh, darling, my pitiful desires and ambitions are dirt beneath the manly boots of your priorities!}
<A>__{kimmy has to smile small. a self awe gal.}
<C>__{julianne }
<D>__{two hundred seedy motels a year? dinners out of vending machines? waiting for you in vermin infested corridors of dark crotch rot locker rooms? this stuff makes me hot!!}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{the very words i've used.}
<A>__{julianne 'thinks it over.' kimmy waits for guidance.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{we make dad your co conspirator. michael does a favor for walter.}
<A>__{simple.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{walter's reorganizing his public relations, needs a brilliant guy who's close to him, who he can completely trust.}
<A>__{kimmy nodding. hope overriding reason.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{so you beg. michael, please do this for daddy, please, please, please, blah, blah, blah... it's only for six months... it would mean so much to me to help him out...}
<A>__{turns up her palms. viola!}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{he'll see right through it.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{only. if he wants to.}
<A>__{they share a smile.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{in six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{he won't get mad, huh?}
<C>__{mr. mooney }
<D>__{may i be of any help, whatsoever?}
<A>__{mr. mooney is the most gracious brit salesperson ever to offer kindness, intelligence and thoughtfulness to a customer. he is large, sixty, with disappearing hair, watering eyes, and a manner that makes you think of immediately hiring a butler.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{bridesmaid gifts for two, well, assertive, outspoken, tennessee debutantes.}
<C>__{kimmy }
<D>__{he won't be mad?}
<C>__{julianne }
<D>__{nothing here seems to quite capture their distinctive personalities.}
<C>__{mr. mooney}
<D>__{something customized, perhaps? we can fashion most any item from gold.}
<A>__{ah. julianne nodding. reflecting.}
<C>__{mr. mooney}
<D>__{an object that might represent what is closest. to their heart.}
<C>__{kimmy }
<D>__{don't even think dildo.}
<A>__{julianne digs through her jumbled bag...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{could you do this...}
<A>__{tossing an object on the counter...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{in 24 carat?}
<A>__{it is a mastercard. a gold one.}
<C>__{kimmy }
<D>__{bingo.}
<A>__{they smile at each other. more bonded than ever.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{you don't think he'll be mad.}
<A>__{a beat. can julianne even make herself do this?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{your call. you can live a lie. in a fabulous selection of red roof inns. or you can make one desperate stab at hap...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{i just don't want to freak him out.}
<A>__{what do you think? julianne stares into the soft gray eyes. it's now or never. the smile of a dear sister...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{how mad could he get?}
