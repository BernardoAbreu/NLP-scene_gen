<L>__{exterior downtown chicago n day}
<A>__{detective atwood comes out of the crowd on the sidewalk and enters a highrise.}
<L>__{interior conference room law offices n day}
<A>__{atwood and her attorneys, a gray haired man in his 60's, and an asian woman about the same age as atwood are on one side of the table. jesse, atwood's soon to be ex husband, very handsome, slightly younger than atwood, and sheila, his attractive divorce lawyer, sit across from them.}
<C>__{asian attorney}
<D>__{we've talked to our client and we've come up with a number that we feel is more than fair.}
<A>__{atwood is not happy with this. the attorney slides a sheet of paper to sheila. she turns it over. on it is written: $750,000 .}
<C>__{asian attorney}
<D>__{we can have a check for that amount in your office by 6 o'clock.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{we told you at the beginning what we want and that hasn't changed. gray haired attorney you know as well as i do, counselor, if we go to court you're not going to get a million five.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{i don't know. let's see.}
<A>__{she holds up the front page of the chicago tribune. "the hangman escapes" story is circled in red.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{this is the front page of yesterday's paper...}
<P>__{(reads)}
<D>__{'hangman escapes'... eh... now, here it is... 'after torturing the young women, thorton meeks would hang them in public places church steeples, balconies, freeway overpasses'... your client captured mr. meeks. this is just one example of the cases my client lived through when he was married to your client.}
<C>__{asian attorney}
<D>__{your client knew detective atwood was a homicide detective when he married her.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{but he had no idea of the mental anguish that being in close proximity to her work would cause him.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{what about the mental anguish i went through being in close proximity to him. who's gonna pay me for that?}
<C>__{asian attorney}
<D>__{we don't need to get into this, tracy.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{yes, we do. i was the one who paid for everything while we were married, and now i'm being asked to give him a bonus for spending time with me when i've already paid for it in the first place.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(to atwood)}
<D>__{tracy, this is not a lot of money for you, and you know how upset i was when meeks said that he was going to escape and he would come back and kill you.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{we're quite willing to find out what a court would think that mental anguish is worth.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{jesse... darling?... you know the best thing that could happen to me right now? that you get hit by a truck and die.}
<C>__{sheila}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{that's it! mr. vialo and i are leaving.}
<P>__{(she and jesse stand up)}
<D>__{you've threatened my client, we're going to ask for a restraining order, and we'll see you in court.}
<A>__{the door closes behind them.}
<D>__{gray haired attorney that's going to cost you, tracy.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<P>__{(standing up)}
<D>__{fuck it. it felt good.}
