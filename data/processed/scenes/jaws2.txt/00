<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{underwater day dramatically lit by sunlight filtering down from the surface. a dim shape, massive, threatening, swims towards us from the distance. then it divides what was one is two, and the shape becomes reality; two divers in scuba gear swimming side by side. they are wearing minimal rubber, considering the cool new england waters: "farmer john" wetsuits with cut off legs, assorted sport diving paraphernalia, including an expensive camera with a flash attachment. one motions "down there," the other signals "ok, i see it," and they dive deeper, into darker waters, where the shafts of sunlight pour into the depths, broken up by seaweed and floating vegetation into cathedral like columns of illumination. sea bottom day the wreck of the working fisherman's boat "orca," formerly under the command of the late captain quint, deceased these four years. buried in the sand near it, still connected by rusting strands of cable, the mangled remains of a shark cage, glimmering with stainless steel highlights. a fitful flash of yellow from under a mossy beard a battered barrel, similarly tangled. the divers, bert and ernie, appear. they're fascinated by the find, and bert, with the camera, snaps a few flash shots. the rapid sequence of flashes signals the presence of a motor drive camera.}
<B>__{another point of view}
<A>__{distant flashes, obscured by vegetation in the foreground. sea bottom, the orca ernie is exploring the abandoned cabin; doors open and shut, moved by invisible currents stirred by his passage. an occasional "flash!" lights up the bottom as bert continues snapping away souvenir shots of this local landmark. bert's point of view camera viewfinder (process) ernie floats up out of a hatch, sees the camera, and strikes a pose, clowning for the photographer's benefit. a big hand, f.g., motions him up into clear water for a formal portrait. he obliges. now he floats in front of us, gently paddling his flippers to maintain vertical stability. one flash. another. then a large, dim movement in the b.g. something's out there, moving towards us. flash. it's bigger, bearing down like a train in a tunnel. flash! it's on us. flash! teeth? blood? flash! blackness, death. ocean bottom, insert the camera floats gently down and settles in the sand. a dark red mist eddies by. a last weak flash.}
