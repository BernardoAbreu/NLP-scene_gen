<L>__{interior sub bay}
<A>__{flatbed is submerging, with only the hatch tower still above the water. bud is being dragged down, still trying to free the rov. he gives up when he sees hippy run in, waving the assault rifle around like a 130 pound rambo. bud climbs the hatch tower and leaps to the deck of the moonpool. hippy clumsily raises the unfamiliar rifle at coffey, visible inside his viewing bubble beneath the swirling water. coffey looks up, stares at the gun... doesn't seem to care.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{shoot!}
<A>__{hippy's squeezing the trigger and nothing's happening. flatbed's hatch tower goes under.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{safety's on! on the side... the lever! up, push it up!}
<A>__{hippy fumble with the selective fire lever, blam blam blam! he put three quick rounds into the ceiling.}
<C>__{hippy}
<D>__{shit!}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{give me that!!}
<A>__{he grabs it out of hippy's hands and aims it at the sub. he racks the water with a long burst. beneath the surface, the rounds nip nasty contrails through the water. they barely scar the front port.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{forget that... go for big geek!}
<A>__{catfish rakes the descending sub with more bursts, trying to hit the shimmering shape of the rov on its back. underwater we see the rounds arcing wild, a few hitting the rov but causing little damage. coffey complete his descent to just above the seafloor. above, catfish empties the weapon.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{gimme a hand!}
<A>__{they all turn. bud is fumbling into his wetsuit like a madman. the others rush over to help him.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{get the rest of my gear. grab that hat there... let's go guys! come on, come on!}
<A>__{catfish slams a backpack onto bud's shoulders, grappling with the straps and hose connections. hippy and sonny (with one hand) are clipping, zipping and buckling all over him. this is a world record suit up time. bud pulls the rubber neck dam of the helmet's lower ring down over his face.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{helmet... helmet! work fast.}
