<A>__{travis pulls into his stall. travis sits in driver's seat, thinking a moment. he looks to his right: the crumpled $20 bill still lies there, untouched since it was thrown there six hours previously. travis reluctantly picks up the $20 bill and stuffs it into his jacket pocket as he gets out of the cab. he gathers up his time report and heads toward book in table. a short while later, travis is walking down the sidewalk near the taxi garage. his hands are in his jacket pockets, obscuring the slight bulge on his left side. travis turns into the box offfice of porno theater. he reaches into jacket pocket for money to purchase ticket and pulls out crumpled $20 bill. seeing the $20 bill, he decides not to use it, and pays for ticket out of his wallet instead. travis walks past concession stand en route to the darkened theater auditorium. a young man is now sitting listlessly behind the concessions counter.}
