<L>__{interior hospital. jennifer's room day}
<A>__{the learys appear in the open doorway. their expressions turn from curiosity to horror. bean has plugged the super nintendo games system into the back of jennifer's e.c.g. monitor. a couple of bats are flapping about the screen but the most worrying thing here (shown in close up) is the sight of a he man type, jumping up and down, lashing out, with his sword, at the passing pulse light, showing jennifer's faint vital signs ... alison gasps. david slowly moves into the room.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{now, bean ... just put down that thing ... nice and slow ... you hear me? come on now...}
<A>__{but bean is determined to keep going it's his way of reviving jennifer. david approaches the opposite side of the bed and gets ready to pounce ... cut to: a close up of the monitor. the he man chases the pulse light ... david dives across the bed just as he man swipes the pulse light with his sword. david has landed on top of jennifer. the pulse light explodes and the monitor screen whites out. jennifer wakes up with a start.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{dad! get off!? what's happening here?! mom?}
<A>__{alison covers her mouth, tearful, but she can't hold it back. she laughs. david and kevin stare at jennifer. they can't help but join in the laughter. jennifer has no idea what's going on. bean is happy that everyone is happy.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i don't care what anyone says. mr. bean brought my sister back from the dead. he did it under laboratory conditions. my eyes do not lie!}
<A>__{alison grins at him. then at bean.}
