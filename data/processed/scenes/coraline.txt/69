<L>__{exterior other estate house night}
<A>__{other wybie escorts coraline up the stone stairs from spink and forcible's apartment. the other mother and other father, a huge, full moon rising behind them, wait at the top of the stairs.}
<C>__{other father}
<D>__{hey there.}
<C>__{other mother}
<D>__{was it wonderful, dear?}
<A>__{other mother's hair looks absolutely beautiful and other father dapper. coraline shakes with excitement as they walk toward the front porch. other wybie holds back, loses his smile.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{oh yeah. they swooped down and pulled me right out of my seat spink and forcible. only they weren't old ladies, that was just a disguise. but then, i was flying through the air and... it was, it was magic.}
<A>__{they walk up the front steps.}
<C>__{other mother}
<D>__{you do like it here, don't you, coraline?}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(nods, turns back)}
<D>__{uh huh! good night, wybie.}
<A>__{other father takes coraline inside. wybie, at the bottom of the steps, looks guilty and sad. other mother glares at him, makes a huge, false smile then points to him. he just lowers his head.}
