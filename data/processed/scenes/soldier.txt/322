<A>__{todd's impassive face somehow reveals the alarm and awkwardness he feels at what's happening to him. tommy is seated on his shoulders, he's got nathan in one arm and johnny is nervously looking up at him as he clutches at todd's huge free hand, and now a little girl, sarah, clutches at his combat pants as sandra instructs her.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{sarah, you hang on to sergeant todd. no matter what happens!}
<A>__{clutching todd's combat pants fiercely, sarah looks up timidly at the big stonefaced man as sandra turns to ellen.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{ellen, go to the commons. tell jimmy pig and mr. slade that sergeant todd says we have to leave as soon as they get everybody out of the root cellar. can you do that?}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(scared)}
<D>__{uh, yes, ma'am.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{it's all right. the soldiers are gone for now. but be careful where you walk. and if it's too smoky, just come back.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(on her way out)}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<C>__{sandra}
<P>__{(calling after her)}
<D>__{tell them to bring all the food and clothing they can carry.}
<P>__{(turning to the children)}
<D>__{do you all understand that sergeant todd here is going to help us, and whatever he says to do you must do immediately, as if he was your father or your mother.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(tears)}
<D>__{he's not my father!}
<A>__{angle on todd's stone face. unfamiliar territory.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{no... but he's our friend. our good friend. do you understand?}
<A>__{frightened faces look to the awkward "killing machine." todd looks like a statue decorated with children. johnny is sobbing as he hangs onto todd's giant hand obediently.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{i want my father and my mother! can he find where my father is? i want him to find my father!}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{no. no, he can't do that, but }
<A>__{a scream! from the corridor! sandra freezes. todd is alert, tense...and covered with}
<B>__{children.}
<A>__{sandra turns and runs for the door as todd starts to put the children down. but he's awkward, slow, not his usual graceful self, trying to be gentle like a clumsy man handling breakables.}
