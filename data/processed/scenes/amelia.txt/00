<A>__{close on a mud streaked airfield in mist and driving rain. a lockheed electra sits. sleek, twin engine, state of the art, its metallic surface battered by the monsoon. waiting. pull back to see... ...our view down onto the landing strip is from an open sided, thatched roof bar high above the airfield. and peering down through the mist and rain... ...a woman in grimy flight clothes gazes at the plane. slender. feminine. at first glance, fragile. then the gray eyes change like the sea, as a stray thought transforms her. something fierce lives there. superimpose: lae, new guinea 1937.}
<C>__{fred }
<D>__{sure i can't talk you inta somethin' more adventurous?}
<A>__{she turns. fred noonan is tall and lean, ruggedly handsome in a reckless way. his flight clothes as rumpled and dirt streaked as her own. he carries his bottle of tequila, and a coke which he sets down for her.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{adventurous? you've got the wrong girl, mister. you should know that by now.}
<A>__{her eyes study him. assessing something as he pours himself four fingers.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{actually. i knew that the moment i met ol' george.}
<A>__{he sips his drink. she says nothing.}
<P>__{fred (cont’d)}
<D>__{i like how you don't talk about him.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{that why i get so many chances to not do it?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{well. natural curiosity.}
<A>__{his charming smile. she's thinking more about the tequila. she reaches to take his bottle and glass. moves them to her side of the table.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{i mean, why would a guy who needs to run the show. pick the one girl he knew could kick his tail?}
<A>__{no response. just her clear direct gaze.}
<P>__{fred (cont’d)}
<D>__{i will bet he knew that. first time he met you.}
<A>__{she looks out to sea.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{he thought i hated him. he never knew i was fascinated.}
