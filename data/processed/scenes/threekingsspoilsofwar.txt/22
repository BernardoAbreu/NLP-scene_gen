<L>__{exterior dessert day}
<A>__{from a distance we see a humvee sitting alone in the middle of a huge, empty desert. just the humvee, nothing else for miles. we hear the sound of a man making machine gun like noises.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{at at at at at. at at at at at.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{cu humvee it's our three boys again, just like we've seen them before: jaeger at the machine gun, epps working his binoculars, and wes at the wheel watching his watchman. jaeger jumps down from the machine gun pissed as all hell.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{they finally start the ground war, and where are we? same place we've been since we got here. securing freedom for the dirt.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{everybody's got a job to do. figure it this way: at least you get to go home alive.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i'd like to go home alive with a couple of iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{hey, look at this!}
<A>__{jaeger and epps come around to wes' watchman. we see cnn footage of some iraqi soldiers looking very tired, hungry and scared surrendering to a cnn news crew.}
<P>__{wes{cont)}
<D>__{they're surrendering to a news crew. you believe that?}
<A>__{jaeger tosses his hands in the air in defeat.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{that's it. it's over. eighteen hours into the war and it's over.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{those soldiers have got loafers on. what kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{a casual one.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{damn, this is sweet. we are going to be home in no time.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{better grab up some sand to take home to your family.}
<A>__{jaeger bites at his lip. he wants to say something, but isn't quite sure how, if he should, if... fuck that, jaeger. just say it.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{we...we could go home with something else.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{with...with millions. millions of dollars.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{jaeger pulls out the drawing from the puzzle box.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{don't even. you're not going to show me that tired map.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{wait. wait.}
<A>__{jaeger starts to tear at his pockets like he's trying to get at a bee. he pulls out his other maps, recon photos... the guy's a walking atlas. epps looks on in shock at the spectacle.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i think you've got some issues to deal with. really, when we get out of here i'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{just listen to me! i've been doing some reading. in the sixteenth century this region was invaded by the turks. it became part of the ottoman empire. when the turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff. anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards. they buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes. i read about this, man. i read about it.}
<C>__{epps}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{wellllll, if you read it it must be true. was it in the star, or the enquirer?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{christ! wes, tell him. you know this stuff.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{the turks invaded, yeah. i guess people would have hidden what they had. but that doesn't mean what was in that box is }
<A>__{jager holds up the puzzle box drawing to one of the maps.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{looks at this! look at it! the drawing is a map of this area right here. you can see it. the geography, the landmarks. it's the same area.}
<A>__{epps grabs the map from jaeger.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{and you know what that area is? it's iraq. iraq! we're doing a little thing with them right now; desert storm. maybe you've read about it.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what we're doing is kicking ass. for god's sake they got iraqis surrendering to news crews. the war is over. we've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you're not saying what i think you're saying. i can't believe you're even thinking it.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{it's right here. this region; an nagaf. i got recon photos. there're no troops there, no fighting }
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you don't know where the iraqis have moved to. and our forces haven't even engaged the republican guard yet, we don't know }
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{it's about a hundred miles from where we are now. how long do you think it would take us to }
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{it's not a hundred miles. it's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain: pure desert, mountains, a river. if the map is even real.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{it's real. i'm telling you, it's real.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{so you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase? it's crazy. tell him it's crazy, epps.}
<A>__{epps thinks. he doesn't say nuthin', just thinks. it's the thinking that makes wes nervous.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{epps, tell him.}
<A>__{epps gets a little more thinking in. wes sees which way this is going.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you're out of your minds, you know that? both of you. you don't even know if there's anything out there. what the hell are you thinking?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i'm thinking about when this war is over. why you figure i'm here? 'cause i got tired of being president of gm? if a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and i'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. so i say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what i say.}
<A>__{wes can't believe what he's hearing. he pulls out the last card he has to play.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{it's desertion.}
<A>__{jaeger sweeps a hand across the great nothingness.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{deserting what? what the hell are we deserting?}
<A>__{both jaeger and epps close on wes for the hard sell.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's war. people get lost all the time in war, cut off }
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{we disappear for awhile. we disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{but we all got to be in for this. we all go, or we do nothing.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{epps, you're smarter than this. jaeger i understand, but you're smarter.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{you know it's real. you know it's real, and you know it's there. you know it.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{if you say that, then i say you don't know second lieutenant epps very well, do you?}
<A>__{wes buries his head in his hands. he squeezes at it hard like he'd rather make his brains ooze out his ears than say what he's going to say.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{god! i don't believe i'm doing this. i don't.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's going to be cool, wes. it's all all right.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{we go, we get rich, we go home. it's that easy.}
<A>__{jaeger and epps start to pack up. to no one in particular, and not too convincingly wes mutters.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{yeah. that easy.}
