<L>__{interior sulacco escape pod #4 night}
<A>__{ripley clicks on the lights. john lifts mattias into the hatch.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{the library }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i told you the earth is still there }
<A>__{ripley checks an instrument: elapsed travel time. her brows knit. she taps the gauge.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{not working.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{it means i don't know how long i was in hyper sleep.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it means the abbot could've been right }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{it means my clock isn't working. we have to get out of here. even if he was right this ship's onboard computer is filled with man's knowledge.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{not everything. some things will be lost forever.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{then man starts over. he's done it before.}
<A>__{she pushes a few buttons. somewhere under the floor a propulsion source hums to life. throbbing through the soles of john's feet. ripley is absorbed in her work.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{okay. the seals weren't broken so we're probably clear. but those dead monks out there are going to start hatching soon. let's get ready to take off.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what can i do?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{here, i need a compressor tank from in that compartment.}
<A>__{she motions towards an open door. john enters the compartment. whoosh clang ! the door closes behind him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey! what?!}
<A>__{he looks out the window in the door. ripley is staring at him, punching keys on a pad next to the door.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey i'm locked in.}
<A>__{mattias scratches at the door.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i know. i locked you in.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i'm not going with you. i've got one inside me.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what?! you can't }
<A>__{she runs a hand across her midsection.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i figured it out. that's why it didn't kill me. he must have impregnated me when i was in the stasis tube.}
<P>__{(remembers nightmare)}
<D>__{it hasn't come out yet because i haven't eaten, it's still dormant. so either i eat and it kills me or i don't eat and i starve to death. either way i die.}
<A>__{john pulls the medieval tome out of his medical bag.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{my book i know what to do }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what, an exorcism? no good.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you can't do this. ripley listen to me you're confusing feeling of guilt for actual sin i can help you }
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(ignoring)}
<D>__{i've set a time lock. when the pod escapes the colony's gravitational pull this compartment will open. then all you have to do is get into the stasis tube with mattias and press the blue button. with any luck a freighter or something will pick you up. good luck.}
<A>__{he pounds his fists against the door.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no! no, goddammit you can't do this. you can't let it win.}
<A>__{she turns away from the door.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{it always wins. we killed it, but it's still inside me you're my last chance. if i can keep you alive it'll make up for all those i've lost.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{listen to me! you have to let me try! ripley: you're my only chance!}
<A>__{she's listening...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i told you father anselm raised me. he raised me and when he was dying i couldn't do anything to save him. i didn't know enough. it was my fault he died. if you don't let me try to save you my body will live but my soul will be dead.}
<A>__{ripley turns and stares at him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{please.}
