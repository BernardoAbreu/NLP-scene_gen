<L>__{interior oval office day}
<A>__{off their reactions, the camera finds an under strength, ad hoc excom kenny, bobby, taylor, bundy, sorensen, mccone, ball and the president. guarded hope all around. the short, balding, pugnacious scali looks discomfited.}
<C>__{scali}
<D>__{i have lunch with him maybe once a month. way he talks, he acts like he knows khruschev personally, but he's never elaborated. i've used him as a source in a couple of stories.}
<A>__{kenny paces behind the gathered men around the president's desk, listening, mind going a million miles an hour.}
<C>__{rusk}
<D>__{the fbi has identified this alexander fomin as the soviet resident, the kgb equivalent of one of our station chiefs. he's their highest ranking spy in this country. and he knows john's a friend of mine.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{all the trademarks of a back channel overture.}
<A>__{kenny eyes bundy, makes him uncomfortable. the president sizes scali up.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{so they'll remove the missiles, and we'll pledge not to invade cuba, destabilize castro or assist anyone who plans in doing so...}
<A>__{nobody dares speak. it's as if the possibility of a settlement will vanish into thin air if anyone moves.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i think... this may be our first real message from khruschev.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{the alternative, mr. president, is that this could be a trap.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{why else would they approach us in this way? it's deniable. the soviets have done nothing but lie to us. this could be more of the same.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{that may be why khruschev's introducing this guy. we've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{that may be what they want us to think.}
<C>__{rusk}
<D>__{the truth is, mr. president, we don't even really know whom fomin speaks for. it could be khruschev. it could be some faction in the politburo or the kgb itself. we just don't know.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{by the way, scali, your activities now fall under the secrecy codicils of the national security act. sorry, no pulitzer.}
<A>__{the gathered men chuckle, only scali a bit dour but being a good sport about it. scali checks his watch.}
<C>__{scali}
<D>__{mr. president, we don't have much time. i'm supposed to meet with him again in three and a half hours.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{well, it seems the question of the day is is the offer legitimate?}
<A>__{he moves away from his desk. the men watch him.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{if it is... if it is, then we can't afford to ignore it.}
<P>__{(beat, to scali)}
<D>__{john, we'll have instructions for you in a couple of hours.}
<A>__{scali nods. rusk escorts him out. they wait until the door closes. taylor looks over at mccone who nods.}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{mr. president, i'm afraid we have some bad news. we're getting gmaic estimates from our latest low level overflights. it appears the missiles are two to three days away from operational status.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{so we don't have much time to play out back channel communiques.}
<A>__{kenny gives bobby a hard look. the president appears unfazed.}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{the quarantine, sir, is not producing results. the chiefs feel it's time you take another look at our options.}
<A>__{the president considers taylor, then looks over to kenny.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{kenny, get over to your old stomping grounds. go through everything the fbi has on fomin. i need your best call: is this guy legit and is he speaking for khruschev? and i need you to tell me by the time i call you, because right after i call you, i'm calling scali with his instructions.}
