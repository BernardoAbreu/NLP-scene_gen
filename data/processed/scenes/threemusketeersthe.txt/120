<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior deck of the persephone night}
<A>__{the deck is filled with swirling fog. henri peers into the gloom as he climbs aboard, followed by the others. he addresses one of the crew, a tall figure standing nearby.}
<C>__{henri}
<D>__{take us to your captain.}
<A>__{the tall figure does not reply, nor does he move. henri demands:}
<C>__{henri}
<D>__{what are you, deaf?}
<A>__{henri goes to shake the man. he grabs his arm, and the man pitches forward, falling face first on the deck. henri jumps back in alarm. milady and the others react.}
<C>__{bodyguard}
<D>__{what is this?}
<A>__{milady's bodyguards rush around the deck, confront the other silent silhouettes. they, like the tall figure... are dead. the limp bodies topple at their touch. the bodyguards shout alarm and panic:}
<C>__{bodyguards}
<D>__{dead! they're all dead!}
<C>__{porthos }
<D>__{well i certainly hope so. after all that hard work.}
<A>__{that's when porthos, and aramis come swooping down from above like avenging angels. they swing on the ends of ropes, slicing through the air, then dropping feet first on top of milady's bodyguards. d'artagnan stands open mouthed, as his three friends draw their swords.}
<C>__{aramis}
<P>__{(calling to him)}
<D>__{you look like you've seen a ghost.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{two of them.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{remind me to tell you the story of horses that could fly above raging waters. a heroic tale of love, death, and musketeers. suitable for the general public.}
<A>__{porthos wades into the bodyguards, at play, shouting as he goes.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{all right then. all those who wish to die, raise your hands! don't by shy, there's plenty to go around!}
<A>__{d'artagnan grabs a sword from the deck, turns to join the fray. and finds himself face to face with parker, the indo chinese bodyguard. parker has two oriental swords spinning in his hands. one knocks d'artagnan's sword out of his hand. d'artagnan does a back flip but falls on the slippery deck. as parker is about to chop d'artagnan's head off, his face grimaces as he is lifted on a sword out of frame. in the mist athos is revealed!}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{sorry i'm late. did i miss anything?}
<A>__{d'artagnan almost cries with happiness. he leaps to his feet and embraces athos.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i thought you were dead.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{keep your mind on the mission, d'artagnan.}
<A>__{he winks at d'artagnan, returns to the fray. d'artagnan follows. the musketeers confront milady's evil bodyguards in the night and fog. athos with brutal perfection. porthos with strange weapons and a healthy sense of the absurd. and aramis with familiar grace and artistry and a marked determination to disable, not kill, his opponents. milady views the latter with alarm. as the battle rages around her, she retreats into the shadows. athos and d'artagnan find themselves fighting side by side. athos observes d'artagnan's technique the usual frenetic windmill of feint and thrust with a frown.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{boy, it's a miracle you're still alive fighting like that.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{first, always find your enemy's weakness. second, take advantage of it. watch me.}
<A>__{one of the bodyguards, who wears a wooden leg, attacks athos. athos kicks the false leg out from under him, knocks him to the deck. d'artagnan repeats, even as he disables his own foe.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{find the weakness. take advantage. got it.}
<A>__{aramis kneels at a dying man, delivers muttered last rites. a bodyguard races into view, means to kill him where he kneels. aramis doesn't miss a beat he shifts, rises, delivers a punch and kick, knocking the man off the ship to the water below. a splash is heard. and aramis resumes a priestly pose, continues the litany.}
