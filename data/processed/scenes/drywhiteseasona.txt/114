<L>__{exterior roadside cafe afternoon}
<A>__{it's lunch time and the working population of jo'burg has paused for lunch. ben and melanie are sitting at a table outside. the cafe is on the outskirts of a very affluent part of johannesburg.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i didn't think you would want to have anything to do with me after that crap in the ossewa.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why? you didn't write it.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i'm a journalist, perhaps tarred with the same brush.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{so what happened? i can imagine. the family, the dominee, colleagues, neighbors...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{a distorted photograph and a few poisoned words and meneer du toit is a leper. that's why i called on you the other day, i needed to talk to somebody rational.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{thanks for the compliment. but remember, you're an afrikaner, you're one of them. in their eyes they regard you as the worst kind of traitor.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you are an afrikaner too, and your articles, in a liberal english paper?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{my mother was a foreigner, i'm not pure, wragte afrikaner. they don't expect the same loyalty from me that they demand from you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what kind of loyalty? blind loyalty. until the deaths of jonathan and gordon, i gave all the loyalty i could give, laager loyalty. you know, melanie, we afrikaners have always lived in our laager, we have not seen what's beyond the mountains.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{has it ever occurred to you that the volk may be scared to leave the laager? that's the downfall of this country. so, where do you go from here?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{we carry on. there has to be justice.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{justice.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{we lost at the inquest, so we pursue them in a civil action. i consulted the attorney dan lewinson.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{we know each other well. customer page #'s 107 110 missing}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{mr. du toit, if you knew what we're working with every day of our lives, and what we're up against, you would understand why we have to be so thorough.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{however you go about it.}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{i can understand you're upset about having your house searched ... but...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i wasn't thinking about myself.}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{what are you talking about then, mr. du toit?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{my thoughts, captain, i'm sure, are an open book to you.}
<A>__{stolz picks up a book of picasso's peace paintings, starts leafing through it carefully, scrutinizing each page. he puts the picasso book carefully back in the place he took it from.}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{an interesting book picasso not one i'm familiar with.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{not on your list of banned books, captain?}
<A>__{stolz doesn't react...}
