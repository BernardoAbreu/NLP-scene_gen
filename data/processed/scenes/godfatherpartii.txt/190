<L>__{interior presidential palace night}
<A>__{the entire reception has been disrupted for an announcement; all the guests in their formal dress and evening gowns, standing with frightened faces like first class passengers on a doomed ship. the president himself, his back to our view, is making an announcement in spanish. while he speaks, we notice continuous movement of his personal staff, carrying suitcases and possessions.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{...because of serious setbacks of our troops in guantanamo and santiago, we feel reluctantly, that we must leave the capital at once. myself and my family must bid you goodbye, and good fortune. we will go directly to ciudad trujillo.}
<A>__{the crowd is stunned; already whispers are moving throughout the guests. the only one who is not completely taken off guard is michael, who quietly steps back, and disappears from the room.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{...my only regret is that there could not have been more warning... as my last official act as president, i hereby appoint a provisional government with dr. carlos m. piedra, as its president.}
<A>__{by now, there is only one thought among the guests: how can they get out, and with what.}
