<C>__{exec 1}
<D>__{we just want to start off by saying that it's a pleasure to finally meet you. while it's been shall we say an experience dealing with sloss here, one of the main reasons we started this whole thing was to meet the guys that do 'bluntman and chronic'.}
<C>__{exec 2}
<P>__{(points at them)}
<D>__{'snootchie bootchies'.}
<A>__{the execs and sloss laugh. holden and banky politely join in. banky shoots holden a 'these guys are idiots' look.}

<C>__{exec 1}
<P>__{(composes himself)}
<D>__{so what do you say! are we in business!}

<C>__{banky}
<D>__{no, i'd like to be remembered as the filthy rich guy who created bluntman and chronic.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{but it'll be all glossy and main stream. we'll lose any artistic credibility we ever had.}

<P>__{(to holden)}
<D>__{you can break her resolve, killer. all it takes is one good man. but if it takes two good men, don't hesitate to call me. that being said, in regards to the more pressing issue, i suggest you leave art to the museums and grab on with both hands to the big, fat check.}

<D>__{i will give it some thought}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(holding up polaroid)}
