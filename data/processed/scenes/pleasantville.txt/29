<L>__{interior gymnasium. day.}
<A>__{there are fifteen to twenty boys scattered around the gym. each is dressed identically in white shorts and black socks with a "pleasantville" jersey.}
<B>__{shot. david.}
<A>__{he stands at the free throw line with a basketball in his hand. (not exactly an athletic image.) david lets go of a jump shot that swishes effortlessly through the net. he looks a little surprised.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{he stares at the backboard slightly intrigued. david retrieves the ball and fires again, this time chucking it up blind. the ball sails through the hoop again, hitting}
<B>__{nothing but net. full shot. other side of the gym.}
<A>__{ten to twelve of his teammates fire simultaneously at the hoop. all of the shots sail through the hoop, none even nicking the rim. the boys retrieve their shots as the coach claps his hands.}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{that's it men. keep it up. big game tomorrow.}
<B>__{angle. david.}
<A>__{he gets the ball and turns his back on the basket completely. david flings the ball wildly over his shoulder. it bounces off all the walls of the gym, then glides through the net as smoothly as the others. he stares in amazement.}
<C>__{biff }
<D>__{bud ...}
<B>__{wider.}
<A>__{biff martin (the boy in the convertible) approaches from the other side of the gym. he is a classic all american hero somewhere between 4 h club member and a future astronaut.}
<C>__{biff}
<P>__{(a little nervous)}
<D>__{hi ya bud.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{hi ya biff.}
<A>__{he fidgets nervously for a moment looking down.}
<C>__{biff}
<D>__{can i ask you a question?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{biff}
<D>__{well ... if i was to ask your sister ... what i mean is, if i was to go up to mary sue ...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh god! are we in that episode?}
<C>__{biff}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i don't believe it.}
<C>__{biff}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you want to ask her out tonight, right? and then you want to give her your school pin ...}
<C>__{biff}
<D>__{yeah ... how'd you know?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{lucky guess.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look, biff ... i don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...}
<A>__{biff's expression falls. he stands crushed in front of david.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{what i mean is ... mary sue's been a little "different" lately ...}
<C>__{biff}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{she won't go out with me?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i didn't say that. it's just that right now ...}
<C>__{biff}
<D>__{i don't know what i'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...}
<A>__{all at once, biff takes the basketball he's been holding and hurls it toward the hoop. the ball does a couple of revolutions of the rim, and then amazingly pops out.}
<B>__{wide angle. gym.}
<A>__{play comes to a halt. all the players turn and stare,}
<B>__{dumbstruck at the sight of a missed shot. shot. david.}
<A>__{he retrieves the ball quickly then hurries back to biff. david pulls him aside as play slowly resumes on the other side of the gym.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{look, i'm sure we'll work something out. i will talk to her or something.}
<A>__{biff looks at him, troubled.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{honest. it'll be fine.}
<A>__{biff nods, a little confused, as david pats him on the back.}
