<L>__{exterior jackie and jean's house, day, 1992}
<A>__{dr. lorenson and starks drive up to jean and jackie's house.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{you want me to come with you?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no, i will be ok.}
<A>__{starks slowly makes his way to their front door and knocks on it as best as he can. the sound, however, is still understandably soft. starks waits and then reaches for the knob on the door. he opens it and looks inside. we first see his face, and the devastation on it, as we guess the sight he's laid eyes on. jackie is sitting at the kitchen table, still only 7 years old. though starks expected it, he falters under the disappointment of seeing a girl he liked instead of the woman he loved. as she looks up at him, it's all he can do not to break down.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{hi. jackie [surprised] hey. [beat] i remember you.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i remember you, too.}
<A>__{starks shakes his head, looking at her. she looks beautiful, and still hopeful. her life lays ahead of her and her fate when he found her in 2004 remains as distant as possible from this innocent, still promising image.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{jackie, how have you been?}
<A>__{jackie smiles; she doesn't get asked that often.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i've been ok.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{good. how's your mom?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ok, i guess.}
<A>__{starks nods. jackie smiles. it's all he can do not to crumble.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{do you think i could see her?}
<A>__{she looks at him and senses, like kids do, the desperation in his eyes.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{jackie calls out for jean, then runs up the stairs to get her. lorenson has gotten out of the car and is waiting outside on the porch. starks remains in the doorway. some seconds later, jean appears gaunt but in a slightly better state than we saw her before.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{hey, jean. nice to see you.}
<A>__{jean looks a little confused.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{i'm sorry? your face looks awfully familiar, i just can't quite place it...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. the guy you yelled at for no good reason...}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<A>__{she gives him a once over, and, seeing how weakened he looks, decides intuitively he can't be much harm. she also notices lorenson waiting by the car.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{there something you need?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you could say that.}
<A>__{starks looks at jackie, hesitating because of her. sensing this, jean asks jackie to leave.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{jackie, go play in the snow.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{just do it.}
<A>__{jackie leaves and walks to the yard. starks watches.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i can't stay long. [motioning to lorenson] that's my doctor and i gotta get back to the hospital. everything i want to say is in this letter. [beat] you can check as much of it as you can.}
<A>__{starks hands her the letter.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i won't be around when you read it...but i hope you believe it. it'd be a real shame if you didn't.}
<A>__{jean looks baffled but, seeming to grasp his urgency, nods.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] i should be on my way.}
<A>__{jackie has been watching this exchange from the shed. when he looks over there, he catches her eye and calls out, with what strength he has left...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{bye, jackie.}
<A>__{these are the hardest words starks has probably ever had to say. jackie just stares after him, as does jean, as he shows himself out.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{happy new year to both of you.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{thanks. you, too.}
