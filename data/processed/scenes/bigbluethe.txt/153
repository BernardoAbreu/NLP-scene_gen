<L>__{exterior small port day}
<A>__{johana sits on the little dock in front of the hotel. jacques pulls on his fins, looks out into the water. she clutches a stopwatch, ready to set it off. a few yards behind, hidden between two bungalows, enzo watches them. jacques takes a few deep breaths and dives a few feet underwater. johana starts the stopwatch. enzo, who sees jacques disappear, walks over to johana and sits down beside her.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{checking out the competition.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{enzo, why do you guys do this?}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{what else is there?}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{you know what i'm talking about. why do you and jacques risk your lives diving?}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(avoiding the question)}
<D>__{you risk your life when you cross the street.}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{damn it! why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{because you'd laugh.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{i won't, i swear.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{i dive in search of god. if i go deep enough i'm going to find him. to me, the sea is a religion... that surprises you, doesn't it?}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(looking down at}
<D>__{jacques in the}
<P>__{water)}
<D>__{a little... you think it's the same for jacques?}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{no. jacques is a creature of the sea. he isn't meant to live on earth, among us... you should know this, johana.}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(reassuring herself)}
<D>__{he can learn. he is learning.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{you really think so? did you tell him you were pregnant?}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{you told bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?}
<A>__{johana shakes her head negatively.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{... not yet.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{don't.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake. and he's only waiting for one thing: that some god up there will turn him into a fish! how long has that moron been down there?}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(looking at the stopwatch)}
<D>__{five minutes and fifty seconds.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(grabbing away the stopwatch)}
<D>__{that idiot!}
<A>__{they jump up. enzo dives into the water. as johana watches panicky, enzo pulls jacques up onto the dock, in his arms. jacques is unconscious. enzo is furious. the fear of loosing his friend has absolutely enraged him. he starts pacing up and down the dock.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{is he alright? what happened?}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{the fool was asleep! if i weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! is that who you want to live with? well, good luck! you better learn to look after him because i won't always be here to do it!}
<A>__{once again he marches off, then comes back.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{... how long was i asleep?}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(to jacques)}
<D>__{long enough to die. listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?}
<A>__{a few steps away, then coming back.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(to jacques)}
<D>__{i will never let you take away my title. d'you hear me? never!}
<A>__{enzo stalks off defiantly.}
