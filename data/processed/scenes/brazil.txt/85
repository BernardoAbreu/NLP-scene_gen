<A>__{sam gets to the corner of the corridor and finds a similar corridor at right angles. he hesitates and continues. then he starts to hear the sound again. it is coming up from behind. mr warren has circumnavigated the building. the same sort of business is being enacted at the same pace. as the scrum reaches sam he gathers his nerve and jumps right in beside warren, and keeps going.}

<A>__{warren suddenly pivots around, swinging sam 240 degrees in the direction they came from plus a bit.}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{ah, here we are!}
<P>__{(they are standing facing a}
<D>__{door one of the hundreds of identical doors lining}
<P>__{these corridors)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{the door says: officer dz 015. sam has no idea what he ought to say.}
<C>__{warren}
<P>__{(solemnly)}
<D>__{your very own number... on your very own door ... and behind that door}
<P>__{(he turns the knob and opens the door)}
<D>__{... your very own office. congratulations, dz 015, welcome to the team.}
<A>__{warren whirls off in a flurry of paperwork and expediters leaving sam standing dumfounded at the entrance to his office.}
