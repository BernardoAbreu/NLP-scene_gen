<A>__{andre and jamal are hitting the blocking sled simultaneously. they drive it out of frame.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{he's now wearing a helmet with a twobar quarterback face guard. he takes a snap and pitches out to running back roland lamont. roland, now wearing a big knee brace, looks sharp as he cuts to the outside.}
<B>__{on pilachowski}
<A>__{the offensive coordinator is standing with mcginty who is concentrating on the scrimmage. suddenly, pilachowski spots someone. his mouth drops open.}
<B>__{on mickey lee}
<A>__{he's a fourhundred fifty pound ex sumo wrestler crammed into a redskin uniform. fat rolls are visible everywhere.}
<C>__{pilachowski}
<D>__{oh my god. that's disgusting!}
<A>__{lee walks up. mcginty bows and says something in japanese. lee bows and answers back in japanese. then they shake hands.}
<D>__{mcginty how you doin', mickey?}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{not bad, coach. mcginty you look great. why don't you work out at left tackle?}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{you got it.}
<A>__{lee puts on his helmet, pulls his ponytail out the back and rumbles away. pilachowski is looking at mcginty like he's crazy.}
<C>__{pilachowski}
<D>__{you're not serious. mcginty i met mickey in hawaii. when he was even bigger. he's a sumo wrestler. that means he's an expert at pushing people around. that's what pass blocking is, leo.}
<A>__{defensive coordinator christopher banes comes running up in a lather.}
<C>__{banes}
<P>__{(to mcginty)}

<C>__{banes}
<D>__{how can i coach a deaf man?! mcginty you don't have to...}
<A>__{he looks across the field at a big, good looking kid named brian murray who is in the middle of a pass rushing drill. murray looks really fast, especially for his size.}
<D>__{mcginty brian murray would have gone in the first round five years back if he hadn't been born deaf. i first saw him play right here in d.c. for galludet college. he's a hell of an athlete. you won't have to tell him anything.}
<C>__{banes}
<D>__{i can't believe it! i got to be able to communicate with him. mcginty then learn to sign. hey, look at it this way: he'll never get pulled off sides on an audible.}
<A>__{mcginty thinks this is funny as shit.}
<B>__{on shane}

<C>__{shane}
<D>__{what was that? mcginty danny bateman. ex cop, ex marine, ex rugby. he's absolutely harmless, if you just play dead.}
<A>__{mcginty helps shane up.}
<D>__{mcginty san diego used you all wrong. you're not a drop back passer. you're a scrambler. like you were in college. so, we're gonna roll out. a lot. get used to setting up on the run. you'll live a lot longer.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i'm very interested in that.}
