<A>__{moving shot. staircase packed with actors, an uphill slalom almost impossible to navigate.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{it's a ridiculously awful movie.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{well, challenge. i wasn't sure you'd remember me... let alone help...}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{stop. you're good. i'm doing them a favor by getting you in.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{well, that's a fresh slant.}
<A>__{they reach the casting assistant, claire.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{claire, this is matt hobbs.}
<A>__{as matt is handed a set of sides, we shoot past matt as he watches cathy move back down the stairs before he can say another word. she moves with wit. he is struck by her. he looks back at claire, who has an intricate hairdo and a ready smile.}
