<A>__{it's a gray, dark day. a funeral is in progress; we're filming from within the mourning party. a large picture of steve is on a stand as the priest reads a eulogy. andrew's camera movements are rigid again, tight and confined, back to how they were when we first started. we see steve's mother and father. his mother is sobbing. his father simply looks shellshocked, staring at the casket. steve's mother leans on his father, and he pushes her away. there's samantha, crying uncontrollably. the camera passes matt... who's staring directly at us.}
