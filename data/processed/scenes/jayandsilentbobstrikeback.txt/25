<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yo check that shit out: the internet. let's see if those fucks said something new about us and that stupid flick.}
<A>__{bob shrugs, heading for the terminal. he inserts a dollar and types, following it up with a mouse click. the pair look at the screen and go wide eyed.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{"any movie based on jay and silent bob is gonna lick balls, because they both, in fact, lick balls. namely each other's."}
<A>__{jay and silent bob look at each other, wide eyed.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{eww.}
<P>__{(reading further)}
<D>__{"yes they are real people. real stupid people. signed, darth randal."}
<P>__{(to bob)}
<D>__{motherfucker! it's time we wrote something back! type this shit down.}
<A>__{silent bob starts typing as jay dictates.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{all you motherfuckers are gonna pay. you are the ones who are the ball lickers. we're gonna fuck your mothers whole you watch and cry like little bitches. once we get to hollywood and find those miramax fucks who are making the movie, we're gonna make 'em eat our shit, then shit our shit, then eat their shit which is made of our shit that we made 'em eat. then all you motherfuckers are nexterior love, jay and silent bob.}
<A>__{silent bob finishes typing and presses "return". he and jay nod at each other, then head over to the counter line, looking up at the menu board.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{that'll fucking show 'em. now we eat our egga mooby muffins, then get back on the road, get to hollywood, and stop that fucking movie from getting made. no more hairy bush nuns, no more dogs. we keep our eye on the prize, and not let nothing and i mean nothing distract me.}
<A>__{as jay finishes speaking, he looks to the o.c. doors and freezes. a gorgeous girl walks through the front doors, all in slo mo to the tune of prince's the most beautiful girl in the world. she's bathed in light, glowing. she bats her eyelashes, gliding toward us. jay is mouth agape wide eyed. silent bob looks at him, then at the o.c.girl. he slowly waves his hand in front of jay's eyes, getting zero response. jay's pov the girl smiles at us. his pov goes from her face, down to her breasts, then down to her crotch. jay moves past silent bob and meets the girl in the middle of the floor. he embraces her and lands a long, sweet kiss on her mouth. after a beat, he starts fumbling like a teenager to get to second base under her shirt, totally incongruous with the music. the girl kindly tries to deter him. but it's just a fantasy. jay's still standing there next to silent bob, but he is sporting a huge boner. silent bob rolls his eyes. he grabs a soda cup off the counter and sticks it over jay's boner, just as the girl joins them in line. she smiles at the zombified jay.}
