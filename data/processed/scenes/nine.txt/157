<L>__{exterior rome, theater night}
<A>__{guido waits, nervous, in a doorway across the street from a theatre that's presenting the pirandello play, diana e la tuda, starring luisa acari. luisa exits the theatre with the company of actors, all of them plaited together in post performance bonhomie. guido watches from a distance. luisa takes the arm of a handsome male, as they cross and head down the street.}
<L>__{exterior anguillara streets day}
<A>__{guido and lilli walk along the waterfront. people pass by occasionally. they talk }
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{i'm glad she's acting again. i made her costumes for the play. she's funny.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{she seemed so happy. i didn't want to interfere... is she with anybody?}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{guido, she's my friend. i'm not her mother. i don't know. i expect so. nobody likes to be alone. promise me you're going to let me cut your hair and get rid of that awful beard.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{i like to get about without everybody pointing at me.}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{and where are you getting about?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{nowhere. here. i walk. just to be able to walk.}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{are you seeing anybody?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{no, no. nobody.}
<C>__{lilli}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{well, it sounds exciting. walking around and not seeing anyone, growing a beard. i might come up here and join you.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{don't tease me, lilli. my heart is }
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{ i know.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{i just miss her. i should have idiot tattooed on my forehead.}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{luisa certainly thinks so.}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(grasping at this)}
<D>__{does she? did she really say that?}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{stop! i'm not going to act as a postman between you both. come back to rome. make a movie. go to work.}
<A>__{he sits. lilli joins him.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{no. never. i've spent this time trying to learn something, lilli, to not be the person who forgets about everybody else, the person who never grew up.}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{you're such a dope, aren't you? making movies wasn't your problem. you were your problem. don't stop being a child. you'll never make another movie! nobody wants that... especially luisa.}
<A>__{she indicates the people who pass.}
<C>__{lilli }
<D>__{guido there probably isn't a single person passing by who hasn't been touched in some way by one of your movies. that's your gift. that's what you've been given. use it. just use it with some grace. for chrissake.}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(doubtful)}
<D>__{the only movie i could make now would be... i don't know... would be about a man trying to win back his wife.}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{sounds perfect.}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{the costumes might not be so bad too.}
<A>__{flash: lights from a makeup mirror. a glimpse of a female eye applying false eyelashes. flash: a man of the collar applies pancake makeup, while a cigarette dangles from his lips. young guido, 9, appears and whispers into guido's ear.}
<C>__{young guido}
<D>__{we're ready to begin!}
