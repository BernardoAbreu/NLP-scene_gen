<B>__{john}
<A>__{is the first to hit the shore. small leather and wood fishing boats tossed by the wake. his coracle is the first into the water. the others running up behind him. he cannot hear the shouts of warning. on the sea dawn the sun cracks over the black water. john's hands move the rough wooden oars. blistered palm opens. blood flows. he tears off a piece of his cassock rips it with his teeth wraps the bloody hand. rows.}

<B>__{next to the hatch}
<A>__{a small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote urgency. john hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny metal lever. he stares at it...a beat. then quickly pulls it down... wuorrrsh ! hull door opens. the doorway is a black maw. john crosses himself. begins to lower his foot into the hatch }

<D>__{john! wait ! don't go in!}
<A>__{john turns back to the open hatch. machine recirculated air flows out. he feels it on the skin of his face. cool. cool, and artificial. it calls to him. he steps in. swallowed by the blackness whoosh clang ! the door closes behind him.}
