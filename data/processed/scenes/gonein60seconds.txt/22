<A>__{a virtual cityscape of dismantled automobile carcasses, piled up high for as far as the eye can see ... a huge fork lift scoops up a wreck and hauls it over to the crusher... watch as the car is flattened, for easy shelving ... midnight auto nonpareil ... to one side of the yard is a garage: watch as a honda accord, with a bloody windshield, enters the garage. a young mexican kid driving. a sign: "lock your car or it may be gone in 60 seconds!"}
