<L>__{interior detention hall day}
<A>__{patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly, mulling over their misfortune.}
<C>__{miscreant}
<D>__{nice song, verona.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{flog me.}
<A>__{he makes the appropriate hand gesture mr. chapin, the gym teacher, sits at the desk in front, ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine}
<C>__{kat }
<D>__{excuse me, mr. chapin?}
<A>__{patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees kat standing in the doorway. she gives him a smile and he perks up a little. kat walks into the room and addresses mr. chapin again. he turns fully to face her.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{sir, i'd like to state for the record that mr. verona ' s current incarceration is unnecessary. i never filed a complainterior}
<C>__{mr. chapin}
<D>__{you didn't have to. he disrupted a classroom.}
<A>__{kat glances over at patrick and motions her head toward the window. patrick shrugs, not knowing what she ' s talking about. she motions again, and looks toward the window with an expression that says, "make a break for it, moron." kat brings her attention back to mr. chapin while patrick inches out of his seat toward the window. the other miscreants watch with glee.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{but, mr. chapin, i hardly think a simple serenade warrants a week of detention. there are far more hideous acts than off key singing being performed by the student body on a regular basis.}
<A>__{patrick is halfway out the window now. and none too happy about it, considering they're on the second floor. he eyes a large tree a few feet away from mr. chapin. he starts to turn away from kat}
<C>__{mr. chapin}
<D>__{you're not gonna change my mind, kat. rules stick.}
<A>__{kat starts to panic, as patrick has yet to make the jump for the tree.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{wait, mr. chapin. there's something i've always wanted to show you.}
<A>__{he turns back toward her again, the very second before he would have spotted patrick. kat glances toward the window. patrick's just about to make the jump.}
<C>__{mr. chapin}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{these.}
<A>__{from behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra at mr. chapin, just as patrick makes the jump. the miscreants cheer, for both the daring' escape and the flash of skin. mr. chapin reddens and tries to be stern.}
<C>__{mr. chapin}
<D>__{i'm going to let that slide, katarina. but if i catch you doing that again, you'll be in here with the rest of these guys.}
<A>__{he motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without noticing patrick's absence. kat smiles at him.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{thank you, mr. chapin.}
<A>__{kat bolts out the door. mr. chapin goes back to his muscle mag, wiping the sweat from his brow.}
