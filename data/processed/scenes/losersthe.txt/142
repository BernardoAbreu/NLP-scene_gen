<L>__{interior medical supply store night}
<A>__{after business hours. a window smashes. roque climbs inside. goes to the front and unlocks it for the others, who carry a bleeding jensen in. they lay him on a table.}

<D>__{cougar?}
<A>__{cougar nods. gathers gauze, needle, thread, and a wooden dowel. comes over as jensen looks at the last one.}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{what's that for?}
<A>__{cougar shoves it between jensen's teeth as an answer...}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{so we split up again. right?}
<A>__{clay doesn't respond...}
<C>__{pooch }
<D>__{right?}

<D>__{pooch...}
<C>__{pooch}
<P>__{(ignoring him)}
<D>__{goddammit, clay, whatever she knows, max knows! it's over!}
<A>__{his words echo through the room. jensen screams through the dowel as cougar sews him up... this is how low they've sunk. clay finally looks up.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{okay. we split up. some of us should go international. i will do that if nobody else wants to }
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{so we just run again?}
<A>__{clay turns to him.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{there's nothing else we can do...}
<A>__{silence. then:}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{there's something we can do.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{three years is enough. if there's a drive at that port that we can use to get clear }
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what part of "he knows we're coming for it" do you not get? they're gonna be waiting for us. par sec is gonna waiting for us...}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{so figure out a way around them; you're good at that shit, clay!}
<A>__{he turns, addressing all of them:}
<C>__{roque }
<D>__{we run now, we're gonna be running forever. this is our one chance to get our lives back...}
<P>__{(to clay)}
<D>__{to steal them back. and i'm prepared to do anything to any one to make that happen.}
<A>__{he looks clay dead in the eye.}
<C>__{roque }
<D>__{never play a longshot, you're never gonna win.}
<A>__{a long beat. clay, not breaking his look with roque:}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{pooch, what's the minimum time to scout the patrols, get an accurate head count on site at the port?}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{48 hours, but aisha knows that }
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{so we hit them in twelve.}
<A>__{roque smiles. pooch blinks.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{twelve hours from now? you mean you want us to go in blind?}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{last thing they'll expect...}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{yeah, cause it's dumb.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{jensen's already got the layout, and cougar can spot on site. right?}
<A>__{cougar nods. he's in.}
<C>__{clay }

<C>__{clay}
<D>__{pooch?}
<A>__{pooch, struggling with the decision...}
<C>__{pooch}
