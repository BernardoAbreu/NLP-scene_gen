<L>__{exterior ghetto street night}
<A>__{a sullen mordechai wanders the streets. absurd xmas decorations, horrific in their appearance blanket the street. morty glances a grotesque faux reindeer with fangs. we hear a growling noise as it lights up. he walks quickly away in fear past...}
<B>__{a storefront}
<A>__{we track with morty as he passes a storefront window. inside, the clerk turns a sign outwards reading, "jews not welcome." we continue with morty as he passes by a second storefront. a similar sign reading, "kykes go home" is turned outwards by another clerk. he continues past yet another building as a sign reading, "monotheists need not apply" is displayed by a third clerk for morty's benefit. morty looks across the street. a sign hangs from a storefront reading "jews ok for about 5 minutes." the fourth clerk gives him the thumbs up. morty finds a spot on the sidewalk outside the building and pulls out his dreidel. he spins it, and we hold on the spinning top for a few beats as morty stares at in wonderment. suddenly, a huge black boot comes crashing down into frame and smashes the little dreidel. mordechai slowly looks up. a menacing santa claus gives him the finger, and exits frame as we hear him sadistically laugh o.s. the words "ho, ho, ho" at morty. we start close on mordechai. rage fills every inch of his face. as we slowly crane away, the opening credits begin as the hebrew hammer theme song kicks into full gear.}
