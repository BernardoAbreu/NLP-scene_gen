<L>__{interior dennis' house later}
<A>__{angle...dennis and his wife beety bundled together asleep, as a ferocious storm howls around the house. angle...quoyle awake on the sofa in dennis' parlor. clutching his blankets around him. eyes jumping with every shriek of the marauding wind. mind racing with thoughts of wavey. and eggshells. angle...bunny asleep with dennis' daughter marty. the room seems to vibrate under the violence of the weather's assault. close on bunny now, and... ...her eyes open. a strange intent in them. a knowledge. she slips from marty's bed in her thin blue nightdress. through the house in the dark, as the wind screams its warning. into the par lor where her father sleeps, as the wind suddenly invades, and... ...sucks her straight up the chimney and out into the heart of the storm. sailing like a loosened kite out across the black water. out and out, as gray light rises, to... ...quoyle point, where she is blown flat against a granite boulder just in front of the green house, which shivers and pleads against the wind, its steel cables straining, and suddenly from within the house, lights come on... ...the white dog is in a window. no longer snarling and menacing, but whining pitifully, begging to be saved. and on the second floor... ...petal alone, wild eyed with terror. she is dressed all in blue, and her daisy chain necklace flies about her throat as she pounds against the glass, her eyes staring directly at her daughter, who can only scream soundlessly against the gale as the house... ...begins to come loose, the first cable snapping and whipping about with the fierce destructiveness of unleashed power, then the next, and another, and with petal still visible, howling in horror, windows bursting everywhere else like flash bulbs, the house... ...slides free, along the rocks, toward the cliff, bunny screeching as it goes over the edge, tumbles down toward the sea, and bunny... ...sits bolt upright in bed, a single gasp as her dad is there, holding her tight. she is soaked with sweat. but her eyes are not wild. they are filled with the knowing.}
