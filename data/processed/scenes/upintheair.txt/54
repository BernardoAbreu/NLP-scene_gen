<L>__{exterior ctc headquarters, ctc morning}
<A>__{a downtown midsize high rise.}
<L>__{interior conference room day}
<A>__{the company has piled in, standing room only. assistants and interns watch through the windows. craig addresses the group including his own superiors.}
<C>__{craig gregory}
<D>__{just thrilled to have everyone under one roof. welcome home boys.}
<A>__{a couple odd looks from road warriors a decade his senior.}
<C>__{craig gregory }
<D>__{i know there's are lot of whispering about why we're all here.}
<C>__{craig gregory }
<D>__{retailers are down twenty percent. auto industry is in the dump. housing market doesn't have a heartbeat. this is our moment. it's one of the worst times on record for america... and i don't want to be standing here two years from now, wondering how we missed this window of opportunity.}
<A>__{a strangely encouraged response from the group.}
<C>__{craig gregory }
<D>__{now, last summer we received a dynamite young woman by way of cornell. she challenged us with some big ideas. my first reaction was, who does this kid think she is? but when i started to give a listen, i was pretty knocked out. so now, with a little peek into our future natalie keener.}
<A>__{natalie stands up.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{if there's one word i want to leave you with today, it's this...}
<A>__{natalie clicks on her power point presentation. power point slide: "glocal" everyone including ryan attempts to pronounce it.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{glocal.}
<A>__{power point slide: "global > local"}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{our global must become local.}
<A>__{power point slide: a slide shows people x 250.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{this company keeps twenty three people on the road, at least two hundred fifty days a year. it's expensive and it's inefficient. when i came to craig three months ago with this, he told me, and quite astutely it's only a problem if you have a solution.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{well, today i stand before you with jus that.}
<A>__{she turns around and fires up her monitor. sitting in a video conference session is a young man in a suit.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{you all know ned in reception.}
<A>__{various people say hello to ned.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{today, i'm going to fire ned.}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{sorry, ned. i'm sure h.r. will hire you back this afternoon.}
<A>__{ned smiles. people chuckle in the conference room. one guy jokes "don't count on it."}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{ned could be any employee in any one of our client's locations worldwide. strategy packets would be shipped in advance. ned would be given a seat and find one of our transition specialists waiting for him.}
<A>__{natalie turns to the monitor and proceeds to fire ned. it is a pretty dry process and lacks ryan's charm.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{mr. laskin, the reason we're having this conversation today is your position is no longer available.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(from a script)}
<D>__{i don't understand. i'm fired?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{hearing the words "you've been let go" is never easy. change is always scary. but consider the following }
<P>__{(using ryan's line)}
<D>__{anybody who ever built an empire, or changed the world, sat where you are now. and it's because they sat there that they were able to do it.}
<C>__{ryan}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{that's my fucking line.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{well, what happens now?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{this is the first step of a process that will end with you in a new job that fulfills you.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{yeah, but, how does it work?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i want you to take that packet in front of you.}
<A>__{ned picks up the packet.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{review it. all the answers you're looking for are inside. start filling out the necessary information and before you know it, you'll be on your way to new opportunities.}
<A>__{ned starts to peruse the packet with fake interest.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{now ned, i'm going to need you to go back to your desk and start putting together your things. as a favor to me, i'd appreciate it if you didn't spread the news just yet. panic doesn't help anybody.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{have a good day, mr. laskin and good luck with your future.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{ned gets up and goes to leave.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{give it up for ned.}
<A>__{people clap and tease him a little. power point: an animation of one monitor becoming multiple monitors, all tied into a central switch board in the middle of a map of the country.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{you can start the morning in boston, stop in dallas over lunch and finish the day in san francisco. all for the price of a t1 line. our inflated travel budget is eviscerated by eighty five percent... and most importantly to you guys on the road... no more christmases in a hotel in tulsa... no more hours lost to weather delays... you get to come home.}
<A>__{ryan is in a state of silent panic.}
