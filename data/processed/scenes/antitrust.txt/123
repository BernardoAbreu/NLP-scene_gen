<A>__{table, a chair at each keyboard. indeed, gary has spared no expense for the toddlers: they're flat, sleek, digital screens. at the moment, they show colorful, childish contour drawings that say where i wanna work (e.g.: a spaceship). there are a dozen more screens on tables at the perimeter of the room showing screensavers (eg: angelfish swimming). milo moves slowly around the table, studying the screens. not surprisingly, most of the where i wanna work drawings are of desks or tables with computers. tracking just ahead of milo, we get to a screen that shows a workstation with a red pennant on the wall, a rubber plant at each end of a desk. even in contour form it's familiar. milo passes it. and comes back to it. staring at it, he sits. he begins typing. [the drawing still occupies the screen, but in a window he's brought up at the bottom, there is dense, dos looking code.] he types furiously numbers, symbols, backslashes. whatever he's trying to do is a challenge even to him. he deletes lines, begins anew, his frustration evident. as he works through the layers of code, the pixels on the screen start to fill in. the contour lines slowly dissolve into a live broadcast image of teddy's workstation in sunnyvale (eerily empty, now). when all the pixels have fallen into place, milo hears click click click click click from every direction, as all the screens in the room fill in with live broadcast images. all of them show variations on a theme: a workstation seen by a camera over the shoulder of a programmer (if he were present). the stations are of various shapes and sizes, but in each case we have an unobstructed view of screen & keyboard. at this hour, few programmers are present. one guy has fallen asleep, his head on a desk. a japanese geek is hard at work: it's day there.}
