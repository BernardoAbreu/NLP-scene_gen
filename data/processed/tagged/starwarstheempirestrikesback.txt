<L>__{exterior plain of hoth day}
<A>__{a small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope. the bundled rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a tauntaun. curving plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two legged beast. the rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop. pulling off his protective goggles, luke skywalker notices something in the sky. he takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed. the wind whips at luke's fur lined cap and he activates a comlink transmitter. his tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.}

<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(into comlink)}
<D>__{well, i finished my circle. i don't pick up any life readings.}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(over comlink)}
<D>__{there isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. the sensors are placed, i'm going back.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(into comlink)}
<D>__{right. i will see you shortly. there's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. i want to check it out. it won't take long.}
<A>__{luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard. he pats the beast on the head to calm it.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{hey, steady girl. what's the matter? you smell something?}
<A>__{luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind. he hears a monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven foot tall shape towering over him. it is a wampa ice creature, lunging at him ferociously.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{aaargh!}
<A>__{luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white claw. he falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified screams of the tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck being broken. the wampa ice creature grabs luke by one ankle and drags him away across the frozen plain.}

<A>__{rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing their new base. the rider, han solo, swings off his lizard and pulls off his goggles. he walks into the main hangar deck toward the millennium falcon, which is parked among several fighters. mechanics, r2 units, and various other droids hurry about. han stops at the millennium falcon where his wookiee copilot, chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter. chewie stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated greeting to his boss.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{chewie!}
<A>__{the wookiee grumbles a reply.}

<A>__{a makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick ice. the low ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. controllers, troops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and monitoring radar signals. general rieekan straightens up from a console at han's approach.}

<D>__{solo?}
<C>__{han}
<A>__{no sign of life out there, general. the sensors are in place. you'll know if anything comes around.}

<D>__{general, i've got to leave. i can't stay anymore.}
<A>__{princess leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short white combat jacket and pants. her hair is braided across her head in a nordic fashion. she overhears their conversation and seems somewhat distressed.}

<C>__{han}
<D>__{well, there's a price on my head. if i don't pay off jabba the hut, i'm a dead man.}

<P>__{(with feeling)}
<D>__{well, your highness, i guess this is it.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{that's right.}

<C>__{han}
<D>__{come on! you want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.}

<D>__{yes. you're a great help to us. you're a natural leader...}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{no! that's not it. come on. aahhh uh huh! come on.}
<A>__{leia stares at him, understanding, then laughs.}
<C>__{leia}
<A>__{you're imagining things.}
<C>__{han}

<C>__{leia}
<D>__{i'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.}

<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{don't try to blame me. i didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. i merely commented that it was freezing in the princess' chamber. but it's supposed to be freezing. how are we going to dry out all her clothes? i really don't know.}

<D>__{do you know where commander skywalker is?}
<C>__{deck officer}
<D>__{i haven't seen him. it's possible he came in through the south entrance.}

<D>__{it's possible? why don't you go find out? it's getting dark out there.}
<C>__{deck officer}
<D>__{yes, sir.}

<C>__{han}
<D>__{not likely. are the speeders ready?}
<C>__{deck officer}
<D>__{not yet. we're having some trouble adapting them to the cold.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{then we'll have to go out on tauntauns.}
<C>__{deck officer}
<D>__{sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{that's right. and my friends out in it.}
<C>__{assistant officer}
<D>__{i will cover sector twelve. have com control set screen alpha.}

<L>__{exterior hoth ice gorge dusk}
<A>__{the jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of a hoth day. luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor. one side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood. he opens his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the gorge walls. luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and futilely tries to unfasten the throngs. exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position. as he hangs there, he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about three feet out of reach. he focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he squeezes his eyes tight in concentration. just as the ice creature looms over luke, the lightsaber jumps into luke's hand. the young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts himself loose from the ice. he flops to the snow in a heap. the startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking. luke scrambles to his feet. he swings his lightsaber and the beast screams in pain.}

<L>__{exterior hoth snow drift dusk}
<A>__{the wind is blowing quite strong now. luke struggles to stay upright, but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over. he struggles to get up, but he can't. the young warrior from tatooine drags himself a couple of feet and then collapses.}
<L>__{interior rebel base main hangar deck entrance night}
<A>__{princess leia stands inside the dark entrance to the rebel base, waiting for a sign of the two rebel heroes. she shivers in the cold wind as, nearby, chewie sits with his head in his hands. in the background, artoo and threepio move through the doors. a rebel lieutenant moves to major derlin, an officer keeping watch with the princess.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{sir, all the patrols are in. there's still no contact from skywalker or solo.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{mistress leia, artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.}

<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{yes, sir.}

<A>__{leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the entrance of the ice cave. the loud booms echo throughout the huge cavern. chewie lets out another suffering howl.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{actually, artoo has been known to make mistakes... from time to time. oh, dear, oh, dear. don't worry about master luke. i'm sure he'll be all right. he's quite clever, you know... for a human being.}

<C>__{han}
<D>__{luke! luke! don't do this, luke. come on, give me a sign here.}
<A>__{luke doesn't respond. han begins frantically rubbing and slapping luke's unconscious face. as he starts to lift the youth, han hears a rasping sound behind him. he turns, just in time to see his tauntaun stagger and then fall over into the snow. han carries luke to the moaning beast. then, with a final groan, the tauntaun expires.}

<A>__{breathing hard, luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over vader. he lands on the floor and slashes at vader as the room continues to fill up with steam. vader retreats before luke's skillful sword. vader blocks the sword, but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes. the energy luke has used to stop vader has brought him to the point of collapse. luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of vader. he then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers himself into the pit.}

<A>__{moving through a tunnellike entrance, luke cautiously approaches the reactor room. he ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward a large window as vader enters. luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack. behind luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall and comes smashing forward toward his back. luke turns and cuts it in half just as another machine comes hurtling at him. using the force, luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an invisible shield. a large pipe detaches and comes flying at luke. he deflects it. sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth. small tools and equipment come flying at him. bombardment from all sides, luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is bloodied and bruised. finally, one machine glances off his and goes flying out the large window. a fierce wind blows into the room, unmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of vader. a piece of machinery hits luke and he is knocked out of the window.}

<A>__{luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at vader so viciously that he nicks vader on the shoulder. the black armor sparks and smokes and vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers. luke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as vader comes at him, slashing at the young jedi with his sword. luke makes a quick move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry. vader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins to fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward. luke glances at the instrument complex floating away. at that instant, vader's sword comes down across luke's right forearm, cutting off his hand and sending his sword flying. in great pain, luke squeezes his forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its extreme end. vader follows. the wind subsides. luke holds on. there is nowhere else to go.}

<A>__{vader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to luke. a calm comes over luke, and he makes a decision. in the next instant he steps off the gantry platform into space. the dark lord looks over the platform and sees luke falling far below. the wind begins to blow at vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the edge. the wind soon fades and the wounded jedi begins to drop fast, unable to grab onto anything to break his fall.}
