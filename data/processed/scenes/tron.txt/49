<A>__{dillinger's office night dillinger is seated at his computer console desk. gibbs, standing, faces him.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{ed, all i'm saying is if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research }
<C>__{dillinger}
<D>__{walter, i sympathize, but i have data coming out of the master control program saying there is something screwy }
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{that mcp, you know, that's half the problem right }
<C>__{dillinger}
<D>__{the mcp is the most efficient way of handling what we do. i can't sit and worry about every little user request that }
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{user requests are what computers are for.}
<C>__{dillinger}
<D>__{doing our business is what computers are for. look, walter, with all respect icom isn't the business you started in your garage anymore }
<A>__{as he speaks, he types a quick command into the console key board, and a series of images appear on the computer's screens: vast computer banks...rows of magnetic disks...icom's globe logo spinning in space, covered with a glowing circuit pattern, then a shot of millions of cancelled checks being counted electronically; then 3 d computer representations of vessels (aircraft carrier and solar sailer). on another screen, we see statements of icom's wealth adding up, accounts receivable and assets.}

<D>__{we're billing accounts in 30 countries, we've got one of the largest systems in existence...}
<A>__{gibbs turns wearily away from the display.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{oh, i know all that. sometimes i wish i was back in that garage...}
<C>__{dillinger}
<D>__{it can be arranged...}
<A>__{gibbs turns to face dillinger again.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{that was uncalled for.}
<C>__{dillinger}
<D>__{i'm sorry, walt. so much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{thank you, no. i have some work to do... assuming i can still log on.}
<A>__{he exits.}
