<L>__{exterior hollywood sign night}
<A>__{the suv comes to a screeching halt alongside the hilly, narrow road. ben jumps out of his car, cell phone in hand. he looks up at the towering sign standing ahead of him, contemplates. does he really wanna go up there? he looks into his suv, gets an idea. the back is opened. ben reaches in looking for a weapon. an old beach chair. not gonna do the trick. a pair of old shoes. nope. then he finds it, a louisville slugger with "actors at bat for brain cancer" written across it.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{thank god i decided to do some community service.}
<A>__{ben takes the bat, closes up the back of the suv. he begins to walk towards the sign when suddenly }
<B>__{his cell rings.}
<A>__{ben answers the call.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{very good. you follow directions well. now for the final part of the game. put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.}
<A>__{ben makes a disgusted face, tosses the bat into the bushes. he approaches the sign, keeping his eyes trained in all directions.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{where are you?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{closer than you think.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{alright i'm here. what the fuck do you want from me?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{to see your reaction.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{reaction to what?}
<A>__{ben passes under the huge, pallid "h" in the sign. what seems at first like a gentle raindrop, beads down ben's forehead. he rolls back his head, his legs turning to jelly, his eyes widening in horror.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{ohmygod! no! christine }
<A>__{has been gutted from neck to groin. she has been fastened to the cross bar in the "h" with heavy rope. her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the southern california wind. utterly horrified, ben staggers into the shadows, not seeing the ghost as he rises from the void, knife in hand. in one quick, brutal stab, the knife is driven into ben's spine. ben screams as he's turned around, face to face with his attacker.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{but i'm the killer in stab 3!}
<C>__{the ghost}
<D>__{you just lost the role ben. consider this your parting gift.}
<A>__{and with that, the ghost drives the bloodstained knife into ben's heart, causing a vicious eruption of crimson.}
