<L>__{exterior barn day}
<A>__{as first stoltzfus and samuel, then book and schaeffer emerge into the barnyard. schaeffer has the muzzle of his pistol pressed firmly against book's throat, just below his jaw. schaeffer pulls up, frowning:}
<C>__{schaeffer}
<D>__{hold it.}
<B>__{what he sees}
<A>__{the amishmen gathered the stoltzfus family, the hochstetler brothers, et al. all staring hard at schaeffer and book.}
<L>__{exterior barn drive day}
<A>__{from a high wide angle the final scene is played out. schaeffer and book, now moving again slowly up the drive, the amish following along closely on both sides.}
<B>__{close on book}
<A>__{as schaeffer prods book forward, warily eyeing the amish.}
<C>__{schaeffer}
<D>__{get back, you people!}
<P>__{(prodding)}
<D>__{keep moving, johnny...}
<A>__{book takes a couple of steps further, then abruptly stops. the amish stand about close, staring, no one moving. book now slowly turns his head, looks at schaeffer.}
<C>__{book}
<D>__{you're going to have to do it right here, schaeffer.}
<C>__{schaeffer}
<D>__{don't try me, johnny!}
<A>__{eli steps forward, bloody cloth held to his head.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{so... will you kill us all, then?}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{as schaeffer's eyes waver between book and eli, book slowly turns until he is facing schaeffer... the gun now leveled and almost pressing against book's chest. book locks eyes with schaeffer. quietly:}
<C>__{book}
<D>__{it's all over, paul.}
<C>__{schaeffer}
<D>__{move! or you die right here!}
<A>__{book's right hand snakes out, grabs schaeffer by the gunhand wrist, twists viciously, schaeffer screams in pain, the gun falls out of his hand, he starts to his knees under the force of book's grip.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as book bends, picks up the pistol, releases schaeffer, pushes him away. schaeffer staggers against hochstetler, who partly to keep him from falling, and partly (it appears) to congratulate him on his surrender wraps one brawny arm around schaeffer's shoulders, gives him a short approving nod... holds schaeffer as:}
<B>__{book}
<A>__{turning, looking into the crowd, finding rachel. their gazes meet, hold for a long moment. in the eyes of both we read resignation... whatever there was between them has been terribly damaged. it is almost certainly over for them, too.}
