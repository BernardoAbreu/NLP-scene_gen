<D>__{that's fifty thousand, huh? it doesn't look like that much.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i was told ten thousand in each pack.}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{you didn't count it?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i never have. it's not my money.}
<A>__{he puts the envelope back in the bag and feels through the folds of a skirt.}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{he might have slipped some coke in here. did you check?}
<A>__{jackie, cool.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{mr. walker promised he'd never do that again.}
<A>__{nicolet's fingers move to a pair of black heels wedged into the side... they touch the shoes... then move over to the envelope, opens the clasp and takes out five rubber banded bond packets of loot.}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{ever been tempted?}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{what? to put one of these in my pocket?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{if i did, i'd have to give you one, wouldn't i? or we could take what we want. no one knows how much there is except us, right?}
