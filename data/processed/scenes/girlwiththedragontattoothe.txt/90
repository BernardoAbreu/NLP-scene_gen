<A>__{cecilia regards blomkvist's vanger family tree on the wall. wherever he only has an old photo, there's a post it next to it that reads: recent photo? insert of cecilia's photo, taken when she was a teenager, and a post it with her name on it.}
<C>__{cecilia}
<D>__{we're all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{it's not about the family. it's about henrik and the company.}
<C>__{cecilia}
<D>__{like i said.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{it's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone.}
<C>__{cecilia}
<D>__{unlike the one that landed you in court.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{unlike that one. correct.}
<C>__{cecilia}
<D>__{so, what you're saying is, you're not really here to look into what happened to harriet.}
<A>__{silence. then }
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i can't ignore such a dramatic event, but no, that's not by any means my focus.}
<C>__{cecilia}
<D>__{so all those boxes gunner carted down here which are where? in the closet now? weren't henrik's private investigation.}
<P>__{(blomkvist can't think fast enough to respond)}
<D>__{i wonder sometimes who's crazier my nazi father or my obsessed uncle.}
<A>__{insert of the photo of young harald in his nazi uniform on the wall.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{since we're talking about it, since you brought it up, what was harriet like?}
<C>__{cecilia}
<D>__{i'm sure henrik has told you.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{he was my age then, and so couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager any more than i can with my own daughter. you were her age.}
<C>__{cecilia}
<D>__{actually, my sister anita was closer to her in age.}
<A>__{insert of the photo on the wall of anita, taken when she was about 17 years old.}
<C>__{cecilia}
<D>__{she knew harriet better than anyone certainly better than i did. you should talk to her.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i'd love to, where is she.}
<C>__{cecilia}
<D>__{if i had to guess london.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{you don't know where your own sister lives?}
<C>__{cecilia}
<D>__{i haven't seen her in years. we never really got along.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i'm getting used to that comment.}
<C>__{cecilia}
<D>__{that's the way it is when you're always after the same boys.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{people generally get over that sort of thing at a certain pointerior}
<C>__{cecilia}
<D>__{oh, i'm long over it, and won't ever have to worry about it again. she hates this place even more than i do. she left, moved to london and that was it. you couldn't pay her to send a christmas card, much less visit.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i will try to track her down for you.}
<C>__{cecilia}
<D>__{don't bother.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{for myself then.}
<A>__{he smiles. she studies him. maybe he's not so bad.}
<C>__{cecilia}
<D>__{if you do, and try talking to her about us, don't be surprised if she tells you to fuck off.}
