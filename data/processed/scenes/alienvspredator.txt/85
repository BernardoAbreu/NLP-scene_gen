<L>__{interior pyramid staircase}
<A>__{lex and sebastian help weyland climb the stair case.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what was that thing?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{you tell me ... you're the pyramid expert.}
<A>__{now half way up the stairs, weyland falls to his knees. he has started to}
<B>__{hyperventilate.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{i have to stop!}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{take it easy.}
<A>__{but weyland isn't listening. he's in full panic.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{look at me...}
<A>__{she grabs weyland's head in her hands.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{...you've taken too much air into your lungs. they're starting to freeze.}
<A>__{not once does lex break eye contact with weyland.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{you have to control your breathing. slow steady breaths. slow... steady ... that's it.}
<A>__{slowly she talks him down, and weyland's breathing drops to normal.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{i'm okay... i'm okay.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{lex hauls weyland to his feet.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{no. i can't.}
<A>__{every word is an effort for weyland. the frozen air has wrecked what's left of his lungs.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{it's hard enough to stand.}
<A>__{weyland slumps against the wall of the stair case.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{weyland...}
<C>__{weyland}
<P>__{(interrupting her)}
<D>__{don't...}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i'm not letting you die down here.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{you didn't lex. go. i will buy you whatever time i can.}
<A>__{at the bottom of the stairs, a looming shadow appears, humanoid in shape. a predator. weyland sees him and grabs his ice axe and holds it like a weapon. weyland walks down the stairs to fight the predator.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{there's another one! we have to go! now!}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{lex and sebastian see the predator at the bottom of the stairs. lex looks at weyland. his look conveys the sacrifice he's about to make.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{run!}
<A>__{sebastian pulls lex away. she exchanges one last look with weyland as they run up the stairs. below: human and predator face off. weyland draws himself up to his full height. he's going out with a fight. weyland swings at scar. scar catches the ice axe and crumples it in his fist. predator vision: scar sees weyland in his distinctive heat signature vision. like an mri, the predator vision scans over weyland's wrecked body, a body riddled with disease. like stars in the sky, the tumors are everywhere. the cancer has destroyed weyland. scar turns away from weyland and walks up the stairs. to scar, he's nothing but a sick animal. weyland is not worthy of the hunt.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{don't turn your back on me!}
<A>__{but scar pays no heed. weyland sees that scar is heading up the stairs after lex and sebastian. he feverishly reaches inside his coat, produces his oxygen bottle and an emergency flare. weyland opens the valve to the oxygen bottle and lights the flare. the gas immediately ignites and the resulting jet of flame engulfs the predator. the predator screams. still burning, scar turns back to weyland and kills him with his spear. weyland dies a hero's death. the predator roars in triumph.}
