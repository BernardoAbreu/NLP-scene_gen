<A>__{the office night dead silence after the daily racket of typewriters and telephones and adding machines. kafka works alone in the utterly deserted office building. he looks out the window and sees a policeman walking by on the street below. he thinks again about going to the law but goes back to work. he hears a sound. he looks around. a sort of a scratching sound. it's coming from the other end of the office somewhere. maybe the bathroom. kafka walks slowly back there. at the bathroom door he pauses momentarily, then turns the handle to go inside.}

<A>__{scratch, scratch. kafka looks for the source of the sound and in sudden startled shock instantly finds it where a huge arm has just been thrust through a small, high window and the ugly hand at the end of the arm is feeling around for the window latch. kafka starts backing away as the hand flips open the latch and now the window, swinging open with a bang, and the rest of the intruder starts coming into view out before all of him appears kafka has run out and slammed the door behind him.}
