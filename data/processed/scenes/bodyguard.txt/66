<D>__{bill devaney, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, bill. hey, everyone. hello! isn't billy thomas the greatest. he's asked me to sing a song. i hope you don't mind.}
<A>__{the crowd roars its approval. frank nervously scans the room. rachel smiles and moves along the stage. music starts in the b.g. masking obvious fear, she starts to sing. as she takes one hand from the microphone, her fingers tremble. she clasps it again to hide her anxiety. angle rachel shot from behind shows her alone and vulnerable, bathed in light, center stage. rachel snatches a quick glance at frank then looks back to her silent audience. angle frank he scans the audience intensely, face to face.}
