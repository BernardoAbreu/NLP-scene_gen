<L>__{interior penthouse night}
<A>__{a bottle of scotch is almost empty. the man talking is yuri. he is russian, in his early forties, a little overweight, a big man wearing a blue silk suit. his thick black hair is greased and combed back. he wears a lot of jewelry, all gold. rings, a bracelet and a rolex. two men in business suits and a weird stoned woman in her late thirties listen to him.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{...but please, my friends, call me yuri. it is my american name... i picked it myself.}
<A>__{the three people laugh. there is a hint of contempt in the way that they speak to yuri.}
<C>__{first businessman}
<D>__{where are you from, yuri? i mean, you sure don't talk like you're from this neck of the woods.}
<A>__{yuri smiles at them.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(silky voice)}
<D>__{no... you are right, my friend. how very observant you are. i am from latvia.}
<C>__{weird woman}
<D>__{tough place.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{yes, i hear this too. but i am not a tough man. i am a simple man who is here to learn from my new american friends.}
<A>__{the door opens and sera comes in. everybody stares at her.}
<C>__{weird woman}
<P>__{(turned on)}
<D>__{is this your friend, yuri?}
<C>__{yuri}

<D>__{sera is my gift to you, my friends from new york city. you may do with her as you wish in this beautiful room, which is also my gift for the night to my friends. you will find her a very willing girl, for all of you...just as we arranged.}
<A>__{yuri smiles again as the second businessman hands him the envelope. the rest of them just stare at sera, aroused by the idea of her.}
<C>__{second businessman}
<D>__{of course, yuri. i think you'll find this just as we discussed.}
<A>__{yuri gets up.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{so, my friends... i have other business to attend. enjoy.}
<A>__{he heads for the door, passing sera. she holds out his arm as he passes.}
<C>__{sera}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{yuri... please! can i talk to you for a moment.}
<A>__{still smiling, he takes sera's arm and leads her into the bedroom.}
