<L>__{exterior nick's house day}
<A>__{alex sits on the hood of the skylark watching the streetlight above with a wary eye. she glances at her watch. about a minute and a half has elapsed and... here's nick now, carrying a lap top computer and a modem hook up. nick sets the equipment in the back seat.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{we need to find a pay phone.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior shopping mall, pay phone day}
<A>__{nick sets up his lab top inside the phone booth as alex watches. he hooks up the modem to the phone receiver and turns the machine on.}
<B>__{the small screen}
<A>__{warms up, and in black and white, we see the same fractals. nick flips off the lap top and sighs.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{that's what i thought.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's not just the cable system. it's in the phone system as well, the electronic net. it's everywhere.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{nick, what is it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence. it's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something. it's self replicating...it mimics life.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{like the fractals?}
<A>__{nick nods. he grabs his skateboard out of the back seat and sits on the curb, spinning a wheel with his finger. he stares at the wheel a moment.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's growing. getting stronger. maybe it's only localized now...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(catching his drift)}
<D>__{...but then it hits the relay stations...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{right. and then communication satellites, and then anywhere.}
<A>__{alex looks up into the sky despite herself.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(disbelief)}
<D>__{anywhere.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we have to stop it from getting out.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{it's already out.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{the police, then...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{give me a break, alex. what are we going to tell them? excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines. i'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{then where do we go?!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{alex stalks off a few paces. thinking. thinking...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{slip stream.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{they made arcade. it's still a game, right? it thinks like a game. maybe it still has to play by the rules. someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.}
<A>__{at this, nick perks up.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you mean we learn the rules...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{and beat it at it's own game.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i was afraid you'd say that.}
