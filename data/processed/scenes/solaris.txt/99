<L>__{interior kelvin's room}
<A>__{kelvin and rheya, post coital. relaxed. on the verge of sleep.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{you sure say "god" a lot when we're doing it.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{i know. i'm putting that in my next report.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{right. the report. report and recommend.}
<A>__{they consider that.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{what does snow think you should do?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet earth. this is hilarious: he thinks it's god, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.}
<A>__{they smile at this. rheya's smile fades before kelvin's.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{sartorius wants to destroy it.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{well. he doesn't think it's god, but for different reasons than me. he's thinking: if i can figure out how to make it stop, than i am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be god.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{he has a pointerior}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{he does have a pointerior that's just not the way i'd like to see it proven.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{you feel sorry for solaris, or for me?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{it's a violent response to something we haven't figured out. don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: he is ruthless. unblinking in his prejudice.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{it was obvious from the way he first looked at me.}
<A>__{a beat. he holds her.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{do i really feel like... i am...?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{yes. yes.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{i'm glad.}
<A>__{a beat.}
