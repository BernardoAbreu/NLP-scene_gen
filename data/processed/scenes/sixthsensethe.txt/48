<L>__{interior den afternoon}
<A>__{malcolm stares as the rain pelts the windows of the den.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{...so your dad lives in pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.}
<C>__{cole }
<D>__{what if she has to pee when she's working? you think she just holds it?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i don't know. i was just thinking the same thing.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{cole }
<D>__{you ask a lot of questions about my dad today. how come?}
<A>__{cole is playing behind the couch. all we see is the top of his head.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{sometimes, we don't even know it, but we do things to draw attention. do things so we can express how we feel about issues... divorce or whatever.}
<A>__{every now and then we get glimpses of things cole is playing with peeking over the back of the couch, but we can't quite make out what he's doing.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{one night, as an example... leave something on a desk for someone to find.}
<A>__{the top of cole's head stops moving.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{cole, have you ever heard of something called free writing? or free association writing?}
<A>__{cole shakes his head, "no."}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it's when you put a pencil in your hand and put the pencil to a paper and you just start writing... you don't think about what you're writing... you don't read over what you're writing... you just keep your hand moving.}
<A>__{cole has become very still. he looks right at malcolm.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{after awhile if you keep your hand moving long enough, words and thoughts start coming out you didn't even know you had in you... sometimes they're things you heard from somewhere... sometimes they're feelings deep inside...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{have you ever done any free association writing, cole?}
<A>__{beat. cole nods, "yes."}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what'd you write?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{words.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what kind of words?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{upset words.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{did you ever write any upset words before your father left?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i don't remember.}
<A>__{malcolm watches him carefully. beat. malcolm waves the question off casually.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{can you do something for me?}
<A>__{malcolm smiles. he rises and grabs his coat.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{think about what you want from our time together. what our goal should be?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{something i want?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{if we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?}
<A>__{cole's brow furrows as he thinks about it carefully.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you don't have to answer now.}
<A>__{malcolm heads for the door, stops when cole emerges from behind the couch. cole is wearing his father's jacket, it hangs to the ground like a dress.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{instead of something i want, can i have something i don't want?}
<A>__{malcolm turns back to cole. malcolm nods "yes." beat.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i don't want to be scared anymore.}
<A>__{cole's sad eyes stare up at malcolm.}
