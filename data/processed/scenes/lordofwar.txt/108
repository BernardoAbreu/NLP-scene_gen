<A>__{yuri collapses on the bar gestures to the barman who immediately pours a line of cocaine in full view. yuri hoovers it up.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{i started doing a lot of cocaine in west africa. i wasn't medicating myself. i was simply playing catch up. i was constantly dealing with people who are chemically imbalanced without the aid of chemicals. it's just a matter of etiquette. it's rude to act sane in a room full of lunatics.}
<A>__{the barman nods to a patron at a corner table a seasoned fighter no more than eighteen years old.}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{he bought you "brown brown", mr. yuri.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(wiping his nose)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{"brown brown".}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{barman}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{a mixture cocaine and gunpowder.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{what does the gunpowder do?}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{it's magic. they give it to the small boys before battle they do anything.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{some other time.}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{you have to try it at least once, mr. yuri.}
<A>__{the barman starts chopping another line.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{barman}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{because it's your gunpowder.}
<A>__{sure enough the barman pours the gunpowder from one of yuri's 39mm shells into the cocaine. the seasoned fighter, assault rifle slung over his shoulder, intimidating air, sidles up to yuri stares him down. yuri has no option, does a line. he washes it down with a swig from a vodka bottle, raises his glass to the fighter. the barman puts on a ukrainian folk song. yuri picks out one of the prostitutes in the bar, starts dancing. he drunkenly dances with one prostitute after another the dance almost violent, the prostitutes flung aside, none lasting more than a few seconds caught in the arms of the other patrons. to yuri, the bar swims before his eyes. the music stops. yuri, wild eyed, looks at the stunned bar room.}

<P>__{(to no one in particular, whipping his vodka bottle off the bar)}
<D>__{i'm going for a walk.}
