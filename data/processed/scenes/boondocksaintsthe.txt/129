<L>__{interior yakavetta's house basement room night}
<A>__{connor and murphy are on their knees in front of rocco, whom they have sat back up in the chair. they are gently placing pennies in his eye and sobbing as they begin to recite the prayer. as they speak, il duce watches. he then begins to whisper the prayer right along with them. their words match up perfectly. he leans against the wall, holsters his guns, and withdraws a cigarette. he rolls it along his tongue and twists it into his lips. the boys are still reciting as he strikes a match. they react instantly. still kneeling they each point a nickel plated 45 toward the duke. they turn in time to see the light from the match illuminate his face. il duce pauses then he strides into the room and proceeds to recite the last half of the prayer. he stops between the kneeling boys and finishes off the prayer. the boys are stunned as they realize this is their father. he makes the sign of the cross over rocco. then he looks down to the upturned faces of his sons. he places a hand on each of their cheeks.}
