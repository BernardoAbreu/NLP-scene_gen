<L>__{interior subway arcade night}
<A>__{the rhythmic duet of boots and loafers follows joe and ratso checking coin boxes and telephone booths till they reach a shoeshine stand, locked for the night. they loiter till a young couple has disappeared, then joe kicks loose 'the padlock on the equipment drawer, mounts one of the chairs and ratso goes to work on his boots with furious expertise, flourishing double brushes, snapping the rag like a jazz drummer.}

<D>__{hey, you're good! i bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{and end up a hunchback like my old man? you think i'm crippled? you shoulda caught him the end of a day.}
<A>__{ratso demonstrates a chimpanzee walk. joe laughs. ratso turns back in panic as another man takes a chair next to joe. ratso is about to retuse when a cop takes the third chair, swinging his handcuffs around to the front, tapping his shoe with his night stick. ratso quickly drops a rag over the broken padlock, cursing under his breath as he starts working on all three customers at the same time.}
