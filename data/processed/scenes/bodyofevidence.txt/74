<A>__{dulaney sits beside rebecca. there is tension between them. he does not look at her.}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{mr. dulaney.}
<A>__{dulaney stands and walks over to the jury.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{the prosecution's case is built on theory speculation. could rebecca lawson have done this? is it possible that she did that? where are the facts? the evidence. the state has presented two spurned lovers and a jealous secretary. hardly what i would call impartial witnesses. where is one shred of conclusive, irrefutable evidence? i don't see it and i don't think you do either. do you know why? because there isn't any.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what's the issue here? that rebecca lawson likes wild sex? no. but the district attorney is trying to make you think if rebecca lawson could stray from the path of normal, accepted sexual behavior, then she could be capable of murder. did she force andrew marsh to make love to her? did she hold a gun to his head? no. andrew marsh wanted her and why wouldn't he? she's beautiful, alluring the type of woman men dream about.}
<A>__{as dulaney continues we sense he is applying his closing arguments to himself.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{it's human nature. we want what we want when we want it. we don't think about the consequences of our actions. when desire fills us we all do things that we know are bad for us. we live for the moment.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{here was an exciting young woman who unlocked doors. doors that led into a new world. a world he entered willingly eagerly. he wanted to please her and so, he did not tell her of his illness. i know it might be difficult for you to understand wanting something so badly that you are willing to risk everything but that's what passion does to you. it's a fire uncontrollable. it consumes you and the only thing you can do is let it burn. andrew marsh let it burn. it was his life his choice and maybe his mistake but making love is not a crime.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we all have fires inside us secret desires. we guard them hold them in the cages that we've built. when someone comes along and opens the gate, they rush out and feed blindly on their pleasure. rebecca lawson loved andrew marsh. she didn't kill him if anything did, it was his own passion.}
<A>__{dulaney walks back to his table and sits down. rebecca looks at him warmly. dulaney does not look at her. cardenas stands to address the jury.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{it's true we all have fires burning inside us. rebecca lawson was very aware of the fire burning inside andrew marsh and she stoked those flames fanning them until they burned so hot that reason and judgement left him. is making love a crime? of course not but the question isn't as simple as that. rebecca lawson used her seductive qualities to entice andrew marsh. she used sex as a catalyst and cocaine as the terminus. the combination of the two provided the conclusion of a premeditated act.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{she asked dr. paley about cocaine. her fingerprints were found on the nasal spray bottle that contained the cocaine and she was the sole beneficiary of andrew marsh's will. she planned it from beginning to end. she knew about his heart. she secretly administered cocaine, then used wild and physically demanding sex to induce a heart attack.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{making love is an act of passion between two people to affirm their vows of love. this was not an act of love this was an act of greed. this was betrayal. rebecca lawson killed andrew marsh and i'm counting on you to punish her for that crime.}
