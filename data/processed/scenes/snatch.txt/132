<A>__{the brothers are standing in front of brick top, they move uneasily from foot to foot. brick top examines the stone. he looks up.}
<C>__{brick top}
<D>__{quite a lump. alright you can go now}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{any chance of taking lincoln with us?}
<C>__{brick top}
<D>__{that's where errol's taking ya.}
<A>__{they turn and errol is waiting for them.}
<C>__{errol}
<D>__{follow me.}
<A>__{they go out of one room into another, and errol shuts the door behind them. vin looks uncomfortable. another door is opened and a man brings out lincoln. lincoln is in bad shape and is relieved to see familiar faces, they are now shut in a room}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{you alright lincoln?}
<C>__{errol}
<D>__{do you know why the governor is the governor?}
<C>__{vinny}
<D>__{err.}
<C>__{errol}
<D>__{i t 's because people are scared of him. you know why they are scared of him?}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{err}
<C>__{errol}
<D>__{it's because of stories. i am sure you've heard one or two of those stories. for example, did you hear about the three black fellas that did a very bad thing, however they made some effort to redeem that very bad thing, so the governor saw fit not to kill em. he thought it would be a more advantageous concept to let them kill each other and let the survivor live to tell the tale. that way everybody wins, well, all except the two that died of course.}
<A>__{we look at the table where we see three large kitchen knives sitting provocatively. tyrone rushes for one of the blades grabs it and runs at vin, vin sidesteps and tyrone keeps running straight into the arms of errol who raises his gun at the last moment. tyrone slides the blade into errol 's ribs and errol fires a shot straight at tyrone. the bullet passes through tyrone and hits john in the throat . vin, lincoln and sol are left wondering what the fuck has just happened}
<C>__{bad boy lincoln}
<D>__{grab it.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{vinny}
<D>__{the gun you prick.}
<A>__{sol goes for one, and vin goes for the other.}
