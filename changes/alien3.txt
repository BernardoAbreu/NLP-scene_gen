<ACTION_ALT>__{GLASS FURNACE}
<ACTION>__{The embers glow.  Flame. The fire GROWS.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{A RIVER OF MOLTEN GLASS}
<ACTION>__{Heated by the furnace to over 1,300 degrees fahrenheit. White Hot.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{GLASS FACTORY}
<ACTION>__{Flickering flame casts dancing shadows on wooden walls. Coarsely grained wood.  Moisture blasted out by years of intense heat.  Timbers split.  Patched with new wood, it too now old and dry.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{SMOKE}
<ACTION>__{Billows up the walls. Hangs as an angry, black cloud amongst the rafters and beams of the vaulted ceiling.  Almost obscures --}
<ACTION_ALT>__{A MAN}
<ACTION>__{On a narrow LEDGE, twenty feet about the Glassworks' floor. His clothing is Medieval.  A rough textured cassock. He is a MONK. LOUVERS are set into the wall.  He angles them open. The smoke begins to escape. The Monk turns, raises arms and LEAPS from his lofty perch -- Gently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a FLOWING FOX -- a primitive hand-held pulley that runs down a rope. He lands next to the glass furnace, surrounded by --}
<ACTION_ALT>__{MORE MONKS}
<ACTION>__{By their dress.  With Blowing Iron and Pontil. They blow and shape the molten glass.  Crack off the finished pieces.  The old way.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ONE PARTICULAR MONK}
<ACTION>__{Black skinned, early fifties. Stirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass, but he is watching something else.  It moves him to song. Lilting tenor lifts high into the air. This is BROTHER KYLE.}
<CHAR>__{BROTHER KYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well would he guess the ascending of the star, Wherein his patient's fortunes settled were. He knew the course of every malady, Were it of cold or heat or moist or dry. Brother John, would-be Doctour of Physick.}
<ACTION>__{We see the object of his song:}
<ACTION_ALT>__{BROTHER JOHN}
<ACTION>__{Not yet forty.  Strong features, but fear behind the eyes. The fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence. A good face, nonetheless. He stirs a thick mixture in a mortar. Next to him another MONK sits holding his arm out in front of him, cassock sleeve rolled up, revealing a vicious BURN.}
<CHAR>__{BROTHER KYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Tend you quickly he will, with bottles from a shelf. But heals not, so easily, The ills which plague himself.}
<ACTION>__{Brother John stops stirring.}
<CHAR>__{BROTHER JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Kyle)}
<DIAL>__{Enough.}
<ACTION>__{He scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the Burned Monk's arm.  The Burned Monk INHALES sharpley as the cool mixture contacts the injured area.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(to the burned Monk)}
<DIAL>__{Relax.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Kyle)}
<DIAL>__{Put those lungs of yours to better use.}
<CHAR>__{BROTHER KYLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, Doc Tor.}
<ACTION>__{Kyle laughs, removes the blowing iron from the molten glass -- a BLOB of white hot glass hanging on the end. He rolls the blob on the Marver, a flat, polished piece of iron, then begins to blow a bottle shaped container. John wraps a fray-edged cloth bandage around the burn.}

<DIAL>__{Keep this from getting wet.  Go home at late afternoon mealtime and don't come back to work today --}

<DIAL>__{But John --}
<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll tell the Abbot.  Just rest today. You're lucky you only burned yourself on the side of the furnace.  If some of that glass had gotten on your arm --}
<ACTION>__{He points to the top of his forearm.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{-- it would've burned clean through to the other side.}
<ACTION>__{He mimes a drop down from the bottom of his arm. The Burned Monk shudders at the thought. BELLS toll.}

<LOC>__{INTO THE HALLWAY}
<ACTION>__{The Hallway is alive with cassocked monks. Their LOW CHANTING reverberates throughout the building. The wooden floorboards creak beneath their combined weights. This is obviously a MEDIEVAL MONASTERY...}

<DIAL>__{You want to be the Abbey's Physician, and you haven't learned the first rule: Don't worry about the patient.}

<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You don't, but thanks anyway.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY}
<ACTION>__{A wide stairwell.  A constant stream of monks all moving down the stairs.  Coming from floors above.  Headed for lunch. Kyle starts down.  John starts up --}

<DIAL>__{Not coming down?}
<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I have someone waiting for me.}
<ACTION>__{Kyle disappears into the crowd. John moves up...}
<ACTION_ALT>__{THE STAIRWAY}
<ACTION>__{A river of brown cassocks running downstream. John is the only one moving against the flow. He exits the stairwell --}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ONE FLOOR UP}
<ACTION>__{A narrow corridor lined with doorways. John moves to one in particular. He doesn't even look as he grabs the door knob. This is his room. He opens the door -- IN BROTHER JOHN'S ROOM An old, worn out DOG lays in wait on an old, worn out cassock which is now serving as its bed. At the sight of John it stands.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come on, Mattias.}
<ACTION>__{The dog, MATTIAS, joins him in the hall. Monk and pet disappear up a flight of stairs. Past another dozen or so Monks who are on their way down.}
<LOC>__{INT. LIBRARY}
<ACTION>__{A vast room filled with rows of wooden tables with low benches between aisle after aisle of floor-to-ceiling wooden shelves jammed to capacity with BOOKS of all shapes and sizes.  Millions of books, from the looks of it. From each book hangs a long CHAIN, long enough to allow the book to be carried only as far as the nearest table. A CORPULENT MONK - BROTHER PHILIP In his fifties, and the Librarian by his stern affect, his position behind a broad, but also old oak desk, and the large KEY hanging from his belt.  He watches the few stragglers return their chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door, then rises and joins them...}

<CHAR>__{PHILIP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{As did mine.  As long as you're alone. Enjoy yourself -- and remember, no book leaves the library.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How could I forget?  Have a good meal...}
<ACTION>__{John watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs. When he's gone from sight John lifts the bottom of his cassock to reveal Mattias.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Perfect.}
<ACTION>__{They move into the library...}
<ACTION_ALT>__{THE MEDIEVAL SECTION}
<ACTION>__{The oldest books. John moves to the stacks. Mattias trots over to a particular bench and sits. This is his regular place.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{AT THE SHELVES}
<ACTION>__{John stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient Tome. He runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding. A smile plays across his lips. He carries the book, places it on the edge of the table so there is slack in the chain. Sits on the bench next to the dog. Clears his throat, opens the book, begins to read...}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(reading)}
<DIAL>__{In the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother Gerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury the Abbot and my sixty fellow monks -- VOICE O/S Sometimes, I think you'd like that.}
<ACTION>__{John turns to find --}
<ACTION_ALT>__{THE ABBOT}
<ACTION>__{Leader of the monastery.  In his seventies but looks younger. His Cassock is adorned with a large, ornately carved, wooden CHAIN in place of a rope belt.  He crosses to the table. John closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect.}
<DIAL>__{John Abbot, I -- I didn't think anyone would --}
<CHAR>__{ABBOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mind?  Just Philip, if he knew.  I passed him on the way up.  He said you'd come in alone.  I knew better.}

<CHAR>__{ABBOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hello, Mattias.  How are you, boy?}
<ACTION>__{The dog snuffles in response.}
<CHAR>__{ABBOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He likes when I read to him and -- I can't --}
<ACTION>__{John looks down sheepishly.  Though nearly forty, he feels almost adolescent in the presence of the Abbot. The Abbot pulls a large key from his pocket.}
<CHAR>__{ABBOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(smiles)}
<DIAL>__{Someone must have left this one unlocked. Take the book with you.}

<ACTION>__{John crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book. He returns the key.}
<CHAR>__{ABBOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It will get easier.  Father Anselm was... an unexpected loss.  You'll do fine.}

<CHAR>__{ABBOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Just have it back before the end of lunch. Oh -- And I didn't see you in here.}

We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what we think is the roof of the Abbey is actually -- THE SURFACE OF ARCEON - NIGHT The door has opened onto the SURFACE OF A PLANTOID! The curving horizon broken only by the very top of the Abbey bell tower poking through from the levels below. SMOKE curls from vents set into the surface. Sunken areas of the planet's sirface are SEAS. This is ARCEON. An manmade orbiter. A shell of lightweight foamed steel, five miles in diameter. Constructed by The Company on Special Order with habitable level within finished in whatever material suits its end user. This orbiter, for reasons to be discovered later, has been sheathed in wood.}

Spread across the inky void. Bathe Arceon's surface with their celestial glow. John smiles at Mattias, breathes deep. The atmosphere up here is thinner, but fresher. He opens the book.

He cannot hear the SHOUTS of warning. ON THE SEA - DAWN The sun cracks over the black water. John's hands move the rough wooden oars. Blistered palm opens. BLOOD flows. He tears off a piece of his cassock -- Rips it with his teeth -- Wraps the bloody hand. Rows.}

<ACTION>__{A small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote urgency.  John hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny metal LEVER.  He stares at it...a beat. Then quickly pulls it down...

His hand brushes over a SENSOR which responds by lighting and -- HSSSSSSSSS -! A BLAST of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe -- John SHOUTS and back up into -- ANOTHER HYPER SLEEP TUBE!!!
