<L>__{exterior santa maria night}
<A>__{the crystalline north star as if seen through an instrument. columbus' silhouette, by an oil lamp, standing at the prow. holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars. some sailors are watching with curiosity. one of them is alonso, a rough, stocky basque. near columbus, on a tressel, various books and charts. he makes an entry in the log. then goes back to his quadrant. he senses mendez standing next to him.}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{due west, captain mendez. and may god be with us...}
<C>__{mendez}
<D>__{god be with us admiral.}
<A>__{mendez doesn't move, continuing to observe columbus.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{what is it mendez? speak!}
<A>__{mendez is hesitant. he nervously clears his throat.}
<C>__{mendez}
<D>__{well... it's the men, sir. they wonder how you know our position. we've lost sight from land days ago...}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(still taking readings)}
<D>__{and what do you think mendez?}
<C>__{mendez}
<D>__{well, i surely know what a quadrant is! but i've never seen it used at night before.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{come over here.}
<A>__{mendez hesitates, then motions to columbus. the sailors are watching, and some approach to hear the conversation.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{now, find the north star. do you have it?}
