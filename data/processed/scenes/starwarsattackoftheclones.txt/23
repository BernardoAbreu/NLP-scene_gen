<A>__{obi wan heads for the bar. anakin blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where alien faces look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. obi wan arrives at the bar. he signals the barman. close somewhere in the room a hand moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. at the bar, a glass is placed in from of obi wan. a drink is poured. he lifts the glass.}

<A>__{he leaves. obi wan lifts the drink and tosses it back. close. the gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. the bounty hunter starts to move toward the bar. anakin checks out alien faces. obi wan signals for another drink. the gun moves toward his unsuspecting back. the drink is poured. obi wan reaches for it. the gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly obi wan turns fast. his lightsaber flashes. there is a shrill scream and zam's arm hits the floor. the gun drops from its twitching fingers. blood spreads. the room is silent. aliens rise menacingly from their seats, and anakin is suddenly at obi wan's side, his lightsaber glowing.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{easy... official business. go back to your drinks.}
<A>__{slowly, the aliens sit. conversation resumes. onstage, the performers pick up their routine. obi wan and anakin lift zam and carry her out.}
