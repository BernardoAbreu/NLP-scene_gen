<L>__{interior butterfield's apartment night}
<A>__{the rooms are spartan. nothing on the walls. nothing on the floors. very little furniture. butterfield sits beside the window, obsessively combing his long hair. there is something feminine about him now: his voice a whisper, his stare distracted. if we didn't guess it already, we're in the presence of a madman. miller is squatting against the wall, picking shards of glass out of his torso. it hurts, but he's enjoying himself.}
<C>__{butterfield}
<D>__{d'amour... d'amour... why do i know that name?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i know him. i saw him.}
<A>__{he stops to pull out a particularly large piece of glass, sighing with pleasure.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i saw him on t.v. some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.}
<C>__{butterfield}
<D>__{he's a priest?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{no. he's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit.}
<P>__{(a beat. a smirk)}
<D>__{like you.}
<A>__{a long beat of silence. butterfield combs. miller digs for glass.}
<C>__{butterfield}
<D>__{i don't want him getting in the way.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{he won't.}
<A>__{another silence.}
<C>__{butterfield}
<P>__{(dreamily)}
<D>__{we've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{what do you mean, "all of us?"}
<C>__{butterfield}
<D>__{you didn't think it was just going to be you and me? a lot of people believed in nix. they haven't forgotten his promise.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{about?}
<C>__{butterfield}
<D>__{death.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{what about death?}
<C>__{butterfield}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{it's an illusion.}
