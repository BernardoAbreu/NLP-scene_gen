<A>__{from inside, we hear the sound of a truck starting.}
<L>__{exterior expressway day}
<A>__{this city garbage van, an immense blue semi trailer, is moving south on the dan ryan at incredible speed, pushing traffic out of the way like a battleship slicing through sunday boaters. eddie is at the wheel.}
<L>__{exterior warehouse day}
<A>__{among the dockside ruins of the old facility, luis carefully checks his snipers and lookouts. shouting in spanish, he directs them into position. from the distance we see a signal from the comacho stationed at the top of a huge grain elevator overlooking the calumet harbor.}
<L>__{interior gym day}
<A>__{kosalas enters. the place is in chaos. he joins the crowd gathered in the center of the facility. brennan and cragie are here. so is music. commander kates has just arrived.}

<C>__{cragie}
<D>__{you little fuckin' bastard!}
<A>__{cragie jumps at kosalas, but kosalas is ready for him, and braces cragie against the wall. with one hand kosalas slams cragie again, and reaches down with his free hand, lifting cragie's pants leg and extracting a drop gun from it's concealed holster.}
<C>__{kosalas}
<D>__{what's this for partner? your next fuck up?}
<A>__{kates steps in and separates them.}
<C>__{kates}
