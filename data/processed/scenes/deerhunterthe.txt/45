<A>__{merle stands motionless, looking out across the valley as nick approaches. the night is brilliantly clear and the fires from the mill light up the sky with an eerie glow. nick comes to a stop a few feet away.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{merle?}
<A>__{merle turns. his face has a strange, distant look, and he gives nick an almost feral grin.}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{you think we'll ever come back?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{from nam?}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{nick moves up beside him. he doesn't know what to say.}
<C>__{merle }
<D>__{i love this fuckin' place... that sounds crazy. i know that sounds crazy, but i love this fuckin' place... if anything happens, nick, don't leave me there. i mean it. don't leave me... you gotta promise, nick. you gotta promise me that.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(half laughing)}
<D>__{merle }
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{promise! you gotta promise!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you got it.}
<A>__{merle lets out his breath. it is as if some great weight had been pressing on him.}
<C>__{merle}
<P>__{(with a laugh)}
<D>__{let's go huntin'. i mean let's do it!}
