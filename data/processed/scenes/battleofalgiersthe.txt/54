<L>__{53 casbah streets. outside. day.}
<A>__{but there is no pity in the other streets and alleys of the casbah, or at the top of the steps. there is anger and hatred. the people are running and shouting. they are shouting from their windows and balconies: ju ju. they smother every other sound. the excitement increases. they run where there is more shouting, more people. they don't know what to do yet, but want to be together. until there is a voice stronger and clearer than the others which gives them a goal and direction. ali la pointe points below beyond the slopes of the alleys and stairways. there below are the european quarters which widen near the sea. the crowd is shouting, pushing, rushing forward with him, like a raging stream, tumultuous and unrestrainable. ali is together with his men, five boys, one of them older than twenty. all of them are armed. the crowd forces them to quicken their step to a run. petit omar is furthest in the rear. he is wearing a pair of short pants, his chest bare; he is barefoot. he calls ali with all his might, but in vain. he tries to join ali, to make his way through the legs of the others; he runs, clinging to the others, pushes, passes near the walls; then, turning into a side street, he rushes into an alleyway, and finally arrives in front. he runs to ali, almost out of breath.}

<D>__{kader says to stop them! he says we've got to stop them!}
<A>__{ali slows down as much as he can with the crowd pushing him from behind.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{where's kader?}
<C>__{petit omar}
<D>__{with the others. they are trying to stop the people.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{go away.}
<A>__{their voices can hardly be heard or understood amid the loud noises.}
<C>__{petit omar}
<D>__{but he says that if we go on like this, we're playing their game, and they'll murder everyone ... stop, ali!}
<A>__{ali continues to run. his face is sullen, frowning, as always when he must choose between instinct and reason. omar calls him again. his voice is hysterical, repeating again to stop. he is hanging on one of ali's arms. ali jerks himself free violently; he strikes the child. omar sways and falls against the wall. with this movement, ali seems to release his anger at not being able to carry out his actions. he slows down, speaks to his men, a few words in arabic, his voice cold and bitter. ali extends his arm and the others imitate him. each man grabs another by the arm, forming a chain. they check the flow behind them and hold back the crowd that is pressing forward.}
