<L>__{interior a small lecture hall evening}
<A>__{a half dozen white lumpen sit at desks. danny writes "anti semitism" in large letters on a blackboard. he turns....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{how many of you think of yourselves as anti semites?}
<P>__{(all the hands go up.)}
<D>__{good. actually, the term is a bit imprecise since technically jews are only one of the semitic peoples.... in fact, arabs are semites, as are the eritreans, the ethiopians, and so on.... but for our purposes an anti semite is someone who hates or is against jews.... now, why do we hate them?}
<A>__{he looks around. the room is silent.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{let me put it another way. do we hate them because they push their way in where they don't belong? or because they're clannish and keep to themselves?}
<A>__{murmurs of "yeah. both." but some are confused by this.}
