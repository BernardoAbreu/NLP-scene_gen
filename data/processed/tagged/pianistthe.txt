<L>__{interior studio, radio station, warsaw day}
<A>__{wladyslav szpilman plays chopin's nocturne in c sharp minor, posthumous. he's twenty eight years old, elegant and handsome. in the booth, separated from the studio by a glass screen, an engineer, wearing collar and tie, monitors the broadcast. behind him, a window to the street with strips of paper taped on it as protection against blast. without warning, a bomb drops nearby, then another and another. the whole building shudders alarmingly and the window in the booth shatters. the engineer and szpilman exchange a look as a man enters the booth and talks urgently to the engineer, then goes. the engineer makes a 'cut throat' gesture, but szpilman shakes his head, determined to play on. he plays, then glances at the booth. the engineer has gone, but through the shattered window he sees fires raging. very near, a loud, terrifying explosion. the reverberations cause plaster to flake and dust to trickle down over his face. and then a bomb explodes even closer. the glass screen separating booth from studio implodes, showering szpilman with glass. he stops, frozen.}

<D>__{2nd child help me! help me!}
<A>__{szpilman goes to him, pulls him with all his might but the boy is jammed in the hole. from the other side of the wall, the sound of an angry german voice and of a boot stamping violently on the boy. the boy screams in agony. szpilman continues to try to pull the boy through. the sound of the german voice swearing and the dull, crunching noise made by the boot smashing into the boy continues, and with every thud the boy screams in terrible pain. szpilman struggles to help the boy whose screams are becoming weaker yet increasingly desperate. szpilman pulls his arms and finally manages to get him through. the boy lies moaning. szpilman takes the boy's face in his hands, tries to comfort him, revive him, but the boy has stopped moaning. his head lolls and his jaw sags. he is dead. szpilman stands quickly and hurries away.}
