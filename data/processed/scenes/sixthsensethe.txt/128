<L>__{interior church late afternoon}
<A>__{malcolm moves to the front of the church down the center aisle. his eyes scan the empty seats. no one in sight in any direction. malcolm stands in the aisle a little out of breath. he holds his hand to his side as he winces a bit. malcolm's eyes float up to the balcony where toy soldiers sit on the bannister. cole's head pops up.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{hello again.}
<A>__{he looks down and studies malcolm.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you been running around?}
<A>__{malcolm nods, "yes."}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{it makes you feel better?}
<A>__{malcolm nods, "yes" again.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i like to run around. it's good exercise.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you want to ask me questions now?}
<A>__{malcolm shakes his head, "no."}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you want to be a lance corporal in company m, 3rd battalion, 7th marines? we're being dispatched to the quang nam province.}
<A>__{cole holds up his plastic rifleman. malcolm's eyes show he understands now.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{maybe later.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{something happened, didn't it?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{yes, it did.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{are you wigging out?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{yes, i am.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{we're not gonna start crying again, are we?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{no, we're not.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{beat. malcolm glances around the empty church before looking back up to cole.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{these people... people that died and are still hanging around. maybe they weren't ready to go.}
<A>__{cole studies malcolm's passionate face. a new face.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you really look better.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... and then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. no one asked them. it's just gone...}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you have nice red in your cheeks now.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{do you know what 'yo no quiero morir' is?}
<A>__{cole shakes his head, "no."}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it's spanish. it means... 'i don't want to die.'}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{not all the ghosts are scary, are they? like mrs. marschal?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what do those ghosts want when they talk to you? think real careful now, cole...}
<A>__{cole stops moving. he looks over the balcony railing at malcolm.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{just help.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{yes! i think that's right!... i think they all want that. even the scary ones...}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you believe now?}
<A>__{malcolm's stare is unwavering.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i believe both of you now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i think i might know how to make them go away.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you do?}
<A>__{malcolm nods "yes."}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i think they know you're one of those guys rare people can see them.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you need to help them. each one of them.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{everyone wants to be heard. everyone.}
<A>__{cole takes a big sigh. fiddles with his riflemen.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{what if they don't want help? what if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i don't think that's the way it works, cole.}
<A>__{cole looks nervous.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{how do you know for sure?}
<A>__{malcolm's eyes are drawn to cole's arm. peeking out from under his shirt sleeve are a set of cuts. malcolm gazes at them.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i don't.}
<A>__{cole and malcolm stand silently in the center aisle of the back of the church.}
