<L>__{ext night urban terrace}
<A>__{a row of rundown terrace houses. some are boarded up. not all the street lights work. those that do cast shadows of parked vehicles glistening in the rain. a front door opens and don appears with rubbish which he puts in a bin. he hears something and looks up to see four big horses pulling a hulking great wagon down the middle of the street. the wagon is a gigantic windowless box. the horses are harnessed and there are reins but no sign of a driver. it's a very weird sight. don, unable to take his eyes off this amazing apparition shouts back into the house from where light from a tv flickers.}

<D>__{carol!... carol!}
<C>__{carol }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{come here! quick!}
<C>__{carol }
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{quick!}
<C>__{carol }
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{i'm trying to watch this! it's the last episode!}
<C>__{don}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{come here!!!}
<A>__{carol appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{but the wagon and horses have gone.}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{it's gone!}
<A>__{carol, disgusted, swats him on the head with the flat of her hand and goes back inside.}
<L>__{ext int night parked car in street}
<A>__{a young couple are snogging in the back of a parked car. music is playing on the radio. they are interrupted by heavy vibrations and the terrifying sight of the huge looming horse drawn box as it trundles past.}
<L>__{ext night the town hall clock}
<A>__{the clock shows and strikes 2am.}
<L>__{ext night a dingy back street}
<A>__{the wagon has stopped. the back begins to open, top, bottom and sides, like a dark menacing flower unfolding its petals. shadowy figures manoeuvre the side panels and begin to raise the roof. while this is happening the camera tracks around to reveal a garishly lit club across the street. a group of drunken youths emerge from the club, staggering, laughing, shouting, drinking, breaking bottles, and throwing up. the lads grope the girls. everyone's having "a great time". they see the wagon and stop, unsteadily, in their tracks.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what the...!}
<A>__{we now see what they see. the wagon has been converted into a stage. we're looking at an old fashioned and very shabby travelling theatre. electric footlights are powered by a clanking generator. the pediment above the stage carries the words: the astonishing imaginarium of doctor parnassus. percy, a dwarf, dressed as a medieval demon and rigged out as a one man band plays a fanfare introducing a young man (anton, 18 19 years old) who emerges from the back of the stage dressed as mercury, the messenger of the gods, with wings on his helmet and sandals.}
<D>__{anton mercury ladies and gentlemen... step up! step up!... i, mercury, the messenger of the gods, invite you... tonight, for one night only... at this very venue... to enter the mind, the very great mind, of doctor parnassus!}
<A>__{percy does a roll on the drum as a curtain behind anton mercury rises to reveal doctor parnassus he appears to be an indian holy man long scraggly beard, chalk white make up, a large red circle on his bald head, a crown of yellow flowers, strings of beads, and partially covered in a loose fitting swath of white cloth apparently levitating several feet above the stage. (he's sitting on a glass plinth). doctor parnassus is seemingly in a trance. a bronze tripod containing burning incense stands beside him.}
<P>__{anton mercury (cont'd)}
<D>__{doctor parnassus... as old as time... yes, ladies and gentlemen, more than a thousand years old ... he has the power to empower your mind. a secret learned in the mystic east. let doctor parnassus open your imagination. let him guide and transport you to worlds and possibilities you never dreamt of... if you dare. but... beware... there are dangers. you will have to choose. will your soul fly?... or will it be dashed on the rocks of darkness? the choice is yours and yours alone. transcend the heights on beauty's wing.}
<A>__{a young woman, valentina,(wearing a wig of long blonde hair and a white, flowing costume which gives her prominent hips and breasts) stands facing an elaborately framed full length mirror nestled upstage amongst cut out trees representing a forest... this is `beauty'. she turns and steps forward. anton takes her hand. they make a couple of dance steps together. they look enchanting and enchanted.}
<P>__{anton mercury (cont'd) (to the audience)}
<D>__{or, if you must...}
<A>__{now percy, in demon costume, leaps from behind the scenery .}
<P>__{anton mercury (cont'd)}
<D>__{... scour the squalid depths with putrid's brother, stench!}
<A>__{percy indicates a ticket dispenser attached to the front of the stage.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{take a ticket and join the queue! only five quid a go! there's no greater bargain on planet earth!}
<A>__{a beer bottle lands on the stage the drunken youths cheer.}
<D>__{anton mercury you choose... fulfilment, grace and light or... waste, filth and darkness.}
<P>__{(under his breath,}
<D>__{watching the drunk,}
<P>__{martin, with contempt)}
<D>__{no prizes for guessing what you'll do.}
<A>__{martin has begun, with difficulty, to clamber onto the stage. his mates laugh and shout encouragement.}
<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(not in character.. he stutters)}
<D>__{no. sorry. that's n not allowed. you have to t take a t ticket first.}
<A>__{anton tries to prevent martin from getting on stage. but martin thumps anton and pulls him into the `audience'. martin's drunken mates laugh and applaud. martin is now on stage and heading for doctor parnassus who is still in a trance. percy tries to head him off but martin shoves percy off the stage. percy lands on the ground with a crash. more laughter from the mob.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(drunkenly to parnassus)}
<D>__{hey you...i wanna audition. i wan... i wanna be a star... i wanna...}
<A>__{martin is on the verge of tweaking doctor parnassus' nose or pulling his beard when valentina diverts him.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{stop! get off the stage!}
<A>__{martin turns his bleary focus to valentina.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{thas a nice pair of jugs.}
<A>__{martin's mates roar their approval.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{get off the stage!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{no. i wan you... i wan you...}
<A>__{martin lunges at `beauty' who retreats up stage. martin blunders into the scenery as he pursues `beauty' who stays just out of reach. she takes cover behind a cut out tree. anton and percy climb back onto the stage as martin continues to chase `beauty'. valentina evades him by ducking through the mirror (made of flexible reflective material slit down the middle). martin crashes after her. anton and percy exchange worried looks. they look at doctor parnassus. should they wake him from his trance? they decide not to but it's a difficult decision.}
<L>__{int ext magical forest}
<A>__{the stage set, which was clearly only a few feet deep, now seems much deeper and to contain many more cut out trees. `beauty' weaves in and out of the 2 dimensional trees as martin chases her further into the increasingly magical forest. beauty's costume has been transformed into something wonderful. (a rainbow studded with diamonds?) valentina comes into view. martin is in hot pursuit.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{come here you little sexpot!}
<A>__{valentina stops, turns, smiles sweetly and slams her fist hard into martin's gut. he doubles up. valentina pauses for a moment, contemplating doing some serious damage, before striding off. martin staggers to his feet.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{come back! you bitch!}
<A>__{he rushes after her but, trips on a root (a real 3 dimensional tree root) and pitches face first to the ground. recovering, he looks up. shock. he is surrounded by a dark, terrible, and very real forest. `beauty' has vanished.}
<L>__{ext the stage night}
<A>__{valentina, `beauty', slips back on stage through the mirror. her costume has reverted to its original state. she examines her knuckles on the hand with which she punched martin. anton looks at her. she shrugs. dr. parnassus is still in a trance, his lips moving soundlessly. anton watches doctor parnassus in awe. `beauty' sighs. she's had enough.}
<L>__{int ext magical forest}
<A>__{martin is lost and terrified in the dark forest.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{mum...mum!...}
<A>__{his voice echoes through the giant trees. but his cries are interrupted by another sound...a tarzan like howl. martin spins around. strange creatures are swinging on vines through the giant trees. they are all around him. they look like hands... with little heads and arms where the wrists should be. they are all howling and jabbering. from behind, a hand creature swings down and grabs martin by the collar, hoisting him high into the air. clearing the trees, martin sees he is not alone. there are many other people all in the clutches of hand creatures swinging on "vines". but, the "vines" are actually long, slim tentacles... dangling from enormous, luridly coloured jellyfish that float through the dark, frightening, sky. from some of the tentacles, bottles of booze dangle just out of reach of the struggling crowd all desperate for a drink.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{please... i will never...! never again!. honest!... from now on... i swear!.. not a drop!}
<A>__{with a smile of satisfaction, the hand creature stops jabbering and let's go of martin's collar. down he plummets. the ground rushes up. matrtin is as good as dead. but when he hits the ground, rather than going splat!!, he bounces high in the air, turns a couple somersaults and lands on his feet. he can't believe what has just happened... and then he hears music. beautiful, ethereal music. in the distance a light is glowing. it's the sun, rising above a majestic mountain pass. cut into the rock, is a long stairway winding up to the summit. the hand creature swings down, gives martin the "thumbs up", and points encouragingly toward the stairway. reformed and determined, martin heads for the stairs. but on reaching them he discovers that each one is 6 feet high. the stairway is ridiculously steep and difficult. letters are carved into the first stair..."the 12x12 step program...good luck". this is going to be tough. the sound of a honky tonk piano makes him turn. behind him the sky is dark. a roadside bar nightclub with flashing neon lights has appeared. he hesitates. he could use a drink before the long climb. he heads for the club. the door to the club is opened by a mechanical fairground figure of a jolly smiling man (mr nick) distinguished by a bowler hat and a red waistcoat.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{hi there. c'mon in. looks like you could use a drink.}
<A>__{martin, relieved and reassured by the welcome, steps inside. the door closes followed by the sound from within of much gaiety and laughter. the camera pulls back as the nightclub suddenly explodes in a}
<B>__{ball of flame.}
<L>__{ext dingy back street}
<A>__{the sound of police sirens. we are back outside in front of the theatre. dr. parnassus rises unsteadily, coming out of his arduous trance.... `beauty" moves to support him as, exhausted, he loses his balance and snaps out of his trance.}

<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{i want you freaks out of here. now. if i ever see you in this parish again i will do you.}
<A>__{doctor parnassus bows exaggeratedly, with a hint of mockery. the police officer suspects that doctor parnassus is taking the piss, but decides not to press it. instead, he knees martin's struggling friend to the ground.}

<A>__{anton moves through the cut out trees and into a fantastic, brightly coloured landscape of dr. seuss like hills and valleys. the sky if full of cloud sized soap bubbles. diego is in the distant using his game controller to make the bubbles bang into each other...trying to burst them. we can hear valentina trying to continue the pitch in the face of the family from hell. their baby has now started wailing. cracks in the ground begin to appear under anton"s feet.}

<A>__{things fly in all directions.}
<L>__{int ext magical landscape}
<A>__{anton, recovering, struggles out from between giant blocks of stone. the world has gone dark. he hears diego crying somewhere in the distance and starts to clamber over the shattered monoliths.. reaching the top, anton sees diego on the peak of a distant rocky pinnacle surrounded by bottomless chasms. there are what appear to be two suspension bridges spanning the void on either side of the pinnacle.}
<T>__{cut to diego :}
<A>__{who is in a state of confusion and terror. is he lost inside a video game he can't control? he presses the buttons on his gaming device to no avail. one of the bridges leads to a bluff where war games are under way... all very video game like. thrilling aggressive music blares forth. mr nick appears, still in red waist coat and bowler hat, but this time in the form of a cut out shooting target with a bull's eye on his chest.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{come on laddy, cross the bridge! join up! be a man. kill the enemy. impress your dad. unlimited ammo. great fun. pow! pow! pow!}
<A>__{as he speaks bullets fly. each time mr.nick gets shot and is knocked flat, he pops back up continuing his spiel. the other bridge appears to be made of black and white piano keys and looks very rickety and unsafe. the piano key bridge descends into a great cavern where hundreds of boy and girl pianists are practising on hundreds of pianos, all playing the same tune the tune dr. parnassus is humming, but with stern, demanding, piano teachers in attendance.}
<C>__{piano teachers}
<D>__{no, no, start again! again! from the top! again! practice! practice!}
<A>__{diego doesn't know what to do. behind him rises a strange mongolfier balloon. dr. parnassus's face is repeated again and again around its circumference. anton's in the basket. diego catches sight of anton.}

<D>__{no, wait! that's the wrong choice! that bridge leads to failure and despair. you'll be dead before you're thirty. this is the one. this is the bridge to manhood!}
