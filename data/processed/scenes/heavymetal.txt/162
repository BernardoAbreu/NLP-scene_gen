<A>__{the young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door. harry's yellow checker cab pulls out into traffic. the vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic chrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers.}

<D>__{the u.n. building. what a joke. used to be a nice place until they turned it into low rent housing. now it's a dump. i wouldn't live there if you paid me.}
<A>__{he switches on the car radio. the music plays as harry's cab passes various time altered new york landmarks; a graffiti covered empire state building windows all boarded up, a decrepit lincoln centre, the marquis reading "continuous live sex show, also inter planetary mud wrestling", new ultra tech buildings crammed between half destroyed wall street office buildings, garbage everywhere. inside the cab, the young man pulls a gun out of his jacket, sticks his arm through the opening in the plexi glass shield, and holds the gun to harry's head.}

<D>__{this city is really going to the dogs.}
<A>__{harry's foot stretches forward and pushes a footswitch. a buzzing is heard, and the young man's body suddenly dematerializes. the gun which he held at harry's head falls to the seat beside harry, who picks it up and tosses it into the glove compartment, beside all sorts of other futuristic guns and weapons.}
