(the mixed strategy equilibria is unstable.) q: what are the two key features of a pure public good? a; non excludability and non rivalry in consumption. q: what is the only known intelligent life form to have achieved faster than light travel without political unification? a: humans. assuming, of course, you regard humans as intelligent. q: what are the six recognized exceptions to the prime directive under federation law? a: leave unanswered q: what are the four key dimensions of vulcan aesthetics? a: leave unanswered q: what term describes an action that is morally praiseworthy but not morally obligatory? a: supererogatory. q: when is an action said to be supererogatory? a: when it is morally praiseworthy but not morally obligatory. miscellaneous dialogue to be dispersed by director to supporting crew or main cast at his her discretion.}
