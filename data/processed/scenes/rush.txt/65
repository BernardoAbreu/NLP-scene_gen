<L>__{exterior motorway hard shoulder day}
<A>__{white smoke pours from the engine. the car has broken down. bonnet up. niki has tried fixing it, but to no avail. niki has a fan belt in his hand, but it's all but disintegrated under the heat of the over worked engine. niki's hands are covered in oil. he is pushing a pen into a large crack in the engine, slick with oil and grease.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{nothing i can do here. the car needs a garage.}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{i'm sorry. you're not in a hurry, are you?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{no. as long as i'm back in maranello by monday morning.}
<A>__{niki walks out into the road. sticks out his thumb...}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{so who are you anyway?}
<A>__{marlene breaks into german...(we see sub titles)...}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{you're from vienna, aren't you. we can speak german. how do you know curd?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{who's curd?}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{curd jurgens. the actor. it's his house. he is, or was until yesterday, my boyfriend. i must have been mad! there is something very attractive about an older man when they behave like one. but when they behave like a frightened child..}
<A>__{marlene gets to her feet...}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{c'mon, let me do this. otherwise we'll never get out of here. we're in italy, after all.}
<A>__{marlene indicates that niki should take a back seat, hitches up her skirt, showing long, tanned legs.. ssscccreeeeeeeeeccccchhhhhhh!!!!! immediately a passing car screeches to a halt, then reverses noisily to pull level. marlene smiles at niki...}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{not bad, eh? three seconds. admit it, you're impressed..!}
<A>__{marlene smiles flirtatiously at the handsome, young italian men driving the open topped sports car..}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{ciao, regazzi...!}
<A>__{but the italian men walk right past her, not seeing her, as if she's invisible, and stare at niki...}
<C>__{italian man}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{excuse me...are you niki lauda?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{italian man}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{oh, my god...!!! i told you it was him..!!!}
<P>__{(blown away)}
<D>__{do you need a ride?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{yes, we do...}
<A>__{the italian man gestures to his car, as his friend loads marlene's luggage inside...}
<C>__{italian man}
<D>__{an honour, please!!! but on one condition..}
<A>__{the italian man whisper in niki's ear. marlene stares, not understanding, as niki protests, but then slowly, reluctantly gets into the car. he starts the engine. marlene watches as the italian men strap themselves in with the seat belts, tightening them...giggling like schoolboys..}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{will someone please tell me what's going on?}
<A>__{marlene turns to niki...}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{who are you, anyway? what do you do?}
<C>__{italian man}
<D>__{you don't know? he's a formula i driver. who just signed for ferrari!}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{him? never. impossible!}
<C>__{italian man}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{formula 1 drivers have long hair, are sexy, have shirts open to here..}
<A>__{marlene indicates...}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{anyway, look at the way he's driving!! like an old man!!}
<A>__{it's true. niki is driving in the slow lane. like a pensioner.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{no need to drive fast. it only increases the percentage of risk. we're not in a hurry. no one is paying me. right now, with zero incentive or reward, why would i drive fast?}
<A>__{marlene looks at him with her dark green eyes...}
<C>__{marlene}
<P>__{(in german)}
<D>__{because i'm asking you to.}
<C>__{niki}
<P>__{(in german)}
<D>__{and do you always get what you want?}
<C>__{marlene}
<P>__{(in german)}
<D>__{usually.}
<A>__{niki stares, trying to resist...but cannot. he does a lightning double declutch... "slam", niki's foot hits the floor, the engine screams, the rev counter flies to the right... and the open topped sports car lurches into warp drive... marlene is thrown back hard in her seat, "jesus", her eyes widen in terror and amazement..}
<C>__{marlene}
<D>__{oh, my god...!!}
<A>__{the italian men scream in excitement, holding on for dear life as niki, his heart not a beat over 60, takes the car to breaking point, in a way it's never been driven before... niki overtakes everyone on the motorway, fearlessly weaving between cars at twice their speed.. we close on niki's eyes, remaining dead calm as his passengers scream all around him, as he accelerates through the other cars on the motorway... his eyes remain calm, his wheels a blur of speed, and we...}
