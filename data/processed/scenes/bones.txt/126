<L>__{interior shotgun's apartment continuous}
<A>__{shotgun's hand shakes as he pours another shot. then downs it. he turns to the window and freezes at what he sees. bones face is just outside the window. the second story window. smiling in at him. shotgun is petrified. but then he picks up his gun and shoots at the face in the window.}
<C>__{bones }
<D>__{free at last, free at last.}
<A>__{shotgun whirls and there stands bones behind him now.}
<C>__{shotgun}
<D>__{it wasn't my fault. i didn't know what they'd planned.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{shush. it don't matter now.}
<C>__{shotgun}
<D>__{no. really, jimmy. remember, man. it's me. i was on your side. don't you remember?}
<A>__{he just walks towards the terrified shotgun, closer and closer, leaning right over his shotgun, his face coming just inches from shotgun's face.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{take a look at what i remember, brother...}
<A>__{his big brown eyes fill shotgun's vision, and in what now seem to be the gigantic pupils in bones' eyes, shotgun sees the old apartment, and there it all is again and again. shotgun sees himself hesitating, almost risking it all and instead giving in, stabbing bones he can't look away. then bones closes his eyes. shotgun sobbing now.}
<C>__{shotgun}
<D>__{i had no choice, jimmy. what else could i do?}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{you coulda died with me. died trying.}
<A>__{shotgun is cradling his weapon, hands shaking. he points it at bones and pulls the trigger. bones doesn't even flinch as the pellets rip through him.}
<C>__{bones }
<D>__{feel better?}
<A>__{bones' impossibly long fingers hold his long rusty razor. he waves the razor in front of shotgun, the rusty blade swinging free back and forth, hypnotically, with a rasping sound.}
<C>__{bones }
<D>__{you gonna be free and clear, shotgun. all debts paid...}
<A>__{and then in one swift motion, on the back stroke, bones' hand and razor slash across shotgun's throat. shotgun doesn't even have time to scream, we just hear his breath and blood escaping from the new opening across his neck. bones bends down and cradling his old friend, whispers gently into his ear. singing, perhaps. we can't quite hear.}
<C>__{bones }
<D>__{see you on the other side, brother.}
<A>__{bones gets up and moves around the room, standing before the window and looking down at the neighborhood he used to own. for a second he sees the old neighborhood, everybody hanging out. then he blinks back to reality. he looks down the block and sees pearl's reader and advisor sign.}
