<L>__{exterior lower manhattan, financial district. morning.}
<A>__{truman emerges from a subway exit in lower manhattan and walks briskly down the bustling street. a snarl of taxis, buses and commuter traffic. a street vendor thrusts a pretzel under truman's nose, a career woman catches his eye. truman stops at a newspaper stand and plucks an issue of cosmopolitan from the rack, quickly flicking through the glossy pages. glancing in the direction of the newspaper vendor and finding him busy with another customer, truman deftly tears a portion of the open page and pockets the cutting. he guiltily replaces the magazine, startled to find the newspaper vendor standing close behind him.}

<C>__{vendor}
<D>__{we ran out.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(hastily departing)}
<D>__{thanks anyway.}
<A>__{as truman hurries away, the vendor picks up the copy of cosmo and instantly turns to the torn page. it is a lancome advertisement with isabella rossellini's nose missing. truman is still in view but the vendor makes no effort to confront him, almost as if he were expecting it. passing one of the tall, black mirrored buildings that grow out of the pavement, truman glimpses himself in the reflective glass. he doesn't like what he sees and attempts to suck in his gut, but quickly concedes defeat. the image triggers another childhood memory.}
