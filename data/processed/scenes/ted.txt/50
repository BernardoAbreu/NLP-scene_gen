<L>__{interior liberty rent a car front office moments later}
<A>__{john emerges from thomas' office, and walks out into the front desk area. we see his coworker, guy (a burly patrick warburton type), handing a car key and a rental envelope to a pleasant looking couple. he looks tired, disheveled, and a little bruised.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{there you go, here's your key and rental agreement, and a complimentary map of boston. thanks for choosing liberty, drive safely. husband wife thank you. thanks so much.}
