We zoom back to the area where DOYLE and RUSSO are beginning to occupy a table.  RUSSO takes the seat on the right, eyes immediately on all that ginch, while DOYLE standing, gives their order.  We do not hear the dialogue but DOYLE asks RUSSO what he wants BUDDY looks up and says "Cinzano." DOYLE turns and says "Two of these." DOYLE slips into the chair opposite RUSSO and the titles roll on.  Unlike RUSSO who is concentrating on the girls, DOYLE is digging the room and the people who occupy the tables in it, as if he is the sort of man who cannot relax until he knows who is around him, why they are there.}

It is a direct line from DOYLE's gaze to the round, ruddy and arrogant face of SAL BOCA, the apparent host of the table of EIGHT MEN AND WOMEN, the Men in dinner jackets with ties tucked under the collars of blue or white lace-trimmed shirts, the Women in a mixture of pant suits and Catskills cocktail party dresses, their hair coiffed towers.}

Seventy-five yards away on the other side of the street the canopied entrance of the Club.  A Continental is parked in front of the club.  The DRIVER leaning on a fender talking with the DOORMAN.  DOYLE frisks his own pockets for a cigarette, coming up with a collection of laundry slips, crumpled notes, toothpicks and matches. One of the slips of paper catches his eye as he is going through the ritual of the cigarette mooch, a slip bearing the name of a girl.  His attention is really on the entrance of the Club and both his conversation and the cigarette business are detached and incidental to the art of waiting through the stakeout.

He glances over his shoulder in the direction of DOYLE's car. Close of RUSSO who has come awake.  The smart-ass demeanor has dropped away.  DOYLE turns to him and smiles.  This district is the heart of every illegal activity in New York. Close rear view of DOYLE and RUSSO ducking down to the level of the dashboard, a reflex action.  He couldn't see them at that distance, although SAL, lighted by his own headlights, can be seen in the background walking around the cars, across the sidewalk and stopped at a recessed doorway. Medium close shot of SAL and partially visible FIGURE at the doorway.  With another glance up the street, SAL takes something out of his raincoat pocket and steps up and into the doorway.}
