<L>__{interior karen's apartment living area day}
<A>__{there's the sound of the front door unlocking and doug enters, carrying a bag. he closes the door behind him and walks in, turning the corner finding karen, looking a bit dazed, standing right there. he's startled, but quickly recovers:}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i come bearing gifts.}
<A>__{karen smiles weakly. she takes the bag and enters the kitchen. he watches her go, worried. then he notices her desk. doug walks over, looking at the printouts she's taped to the wall. and the photo of the house in the center. bewildered, he sits down, leaning forward and taking a good look. his eyes stop on the picture of toshio. doug turns to see karen staring at him from the kitchen. it's an awkward moment: he's concerned, but doesn't know what to say. and neither does karen. finally she approaches, looking at toshio's picture:}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{that's the boy who was there yesterday. in that house. but this boy, he's }
<A>__{her voice trembles, her fear showing through.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{ he's supposed to be dead.}
<A>__{a beat. karen's eyes plead with doug.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i saw him, doug. i talked to him. he told me his name. a boy who was killed by his father three years ago told me his name.}
<A>__{doug looks away, shaking his head.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you don't believe me.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{how can i believe you, karen?}
<A>__{karen's face darkens. before she can retort the phone rings. as karen walks across the room to answer it, doug starts reading the newspaper article.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{she listens. her face slowly drops.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(almost a whisper:)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{she numbly lowers the phone. doug turns to her, seeing that something's very wrong. snapping to life, karen walks to the desk, picking up the photo of peter and maria's condo and a map of tokyo. doug puts a hand on her shoulder. she finally looks at him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{alex and yoko are dead.}
<A>__{doug, surprised, doesn't know what to say. karen doesn't give him a chance to figure it out:}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(intense:)}
<D>__{there's something wrong with that house, doug. something really bad.}
<P>__{(re: peter's photo)}
<D>__{the boy in that house, he had a photo of this man. he died on that same day three years ago. i need to talk to his wife... widow. if i can find out what happened, or if... maybe }
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{maybe, what?}
<A>__{karen pulls away, making for the door. doug follows.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i'm concerned about you going out while you're so upset }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you don't understand. i have to, doug.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{because i've been inside that house, doug. don't you get it? i've been inside!}
<A>__{a beat. we see the resolve come over karen's face. she reaches out and touches doug tenderly.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i love you. but i have to go.}
<A>__{she leaves. doug, troubled, turns back to the desk. he looks up at the wall, tracing a finger over the photo of the house. beneath it, is the address...}
