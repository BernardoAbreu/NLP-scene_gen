<L>__{interior mumford's office day}
<A>__{althea is sobbing. mumford hands her a new kleenex from the box next to the couch. she wads it with her current one and tries to stop crying. mumford settles back in his chair, patient.}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{what do they want from me?}
<P>__{(more sobbing)}
<D>__{what have i done that's so wrong?}
<P>__{(pulling it together)}
<D>__{they act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... they do! believe me. everybody's got something...}
<P>__{(looks at mumford)}
<D>__{even you probably have things.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{me more than most.}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{why are they ganging up against me?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i'm not sure. but i think they're worried about you.}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{it's the kids, you know, not jeremy. he had nothing to do with this except pay, of course. he's always willing to pay. he's extremely generous.}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{i'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{how did they threaten you?}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{they said if i didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.}
<P>__{(a beseeching look)}
<D>__{what do you think about that?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{good kids.}
<A>__{althea stares at him a long moment. she knows he's right. tears well up in her eyes and roll down her cheeks. she grabs another kleenex. in the midst of the torrent she tries to talk, but it's undecipherable:}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{hmm?}
<A>__{althea uses three new tissues to dry up her face.}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{i said... you must come out to the house for dinner on thursday.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{really? you think so?}
<C>__{althea}
<D>__{yes. jeremy will be home for the weekend. and you can meet the kids.}
<A>__{mumford considers, then nods his assent.}
