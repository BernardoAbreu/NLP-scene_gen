<L>__{interior ministerial meeting room day}
<A>__{lacon and smiley are meeting with the minister.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{this meeting is not taking place. is that clear?}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{perfectly, minister. (beat) there is a house, somewhere in this city, where alleline and the others meet witchcraft's london representative. i need the address of that house.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about.}
<A>__{smiley stares at him.}
<P>__{minister (cont'd (cont'd)}
<D>__{i don't know the address. and i fail to see the... i thought lacon had made it clear to you, keep your nose bloody well out of witchcraft's business!}
<C>__{smiley}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{it's lacon's advice i'm following. (to lacon) you told me to follow in control's footsteps.}
<C>__{minister}
<P>__{(snapping)}
<D>__{well, i wouldn't consider that sound advice, after the bloody mess control left us with. it's taken alleline and, if i may say so, myself this long to get us back into the race.}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{i'm glad you take some of the credit.}
<A>__{lacon glances sharply at smiley there's something different about him, his tone...}
<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{the man alleline and the others meet is called polyakov. you believe his role is to bring information from witchcraft to you. his real role is to receive information from the mole to take back to karla.}
<A>__{he has the minister's full attention now. a long silence.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{that's... that's not possible.}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{made possible. by you. when he steals our secrets he does it under the very nose of the circus, in the house which you persuaded the treasury to pay for. i'm sure you'll be able to take full credit for that.}
<C>__{minister}
<P>__{(appalled)}
<D>__{witchcraft's intelligence is genuine! it's been gold!}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{just enough glitter, amongst the chicken feed. control didn't believe in miracles and he didn't believe in witchcraft. but you were lazy and you were greedy and so you hounded him out of the circus and you let karla in.}
<A>__{his voice is still calm, but it's clear what's different now. there's a quiet fury in him. the minister is ashen.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{oh god... we can't be made to look like fucking fools again! forget europe, if we have the black men getting to hear about this on walla wallah news! what if we find the mole and we move him sideways, some department where he can't do any harm? is the kremlin likely to boast about this?}
<C>__{lacon}
<D>__{not in their interests sir. they need the enemy to look like a threat...}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{well, tell them to play the game. we don't go crowing about their fuck ups!}
<A>__{in their panic, both men are addressing each other, momentarily forgetting smiley.}
<C>__{smiley}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{we are not the prize. we're the bait.}
<A>__{they turn to him.}
<C>__{smiley }
<D>__{you've opened negotiations to exchange intelligence with the americans. what they tell the circus, they'll be telling the kremlin. witchcraft's information, the "gold" karla let you have? it wasn't to lure you. it was to lure the americans. now, do you want to take credit for that?}
<A>__{lacon and the minister stare at smiley.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{what can we do?}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{we have one thing the mole wants.}
