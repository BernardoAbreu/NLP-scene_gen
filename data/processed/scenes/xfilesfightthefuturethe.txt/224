<A>__{revealing a tunisian man dressed in peasant clothes. he is carrying a piece of paper. moving with hasty purpose. stopping at the end of one of the long rows of corn where conrad strughold is coming toward him. making his way between rows of stalks. the peasant waits patiently as strughold approaches, handing him the piece of paper. strughold reads it, his otherwise steely countenance reflecting a disturbance seen only in the slight narrowing of his eyes. he looks up at the peasant and says something to him in tunisian arabic. said as command, which causes the peasant to nod dutifully and move off as he came. strughold stands for a moment, then crumples the paper slightly and drops it. moving off down the same corn row in which he approached. camera dropping to the ground where we find the paper on which we see a flat section that is not so crumpled we cannot read the words: x files re opened. stop. please}
