<A>__{george walks around the maze of cubicles back to his own. he finds an empty box and starts to pack. against a wall, a large rack is filled with spools of architectural plans. george pulls one of the plans down, rolls it out and detaches the wooden spool. without warning and with a fury hard to fathom, he proceeds to bat and smash a shelf of beautifully rendered models. heads pop up in other cubicles as george walks out of his own and armed with a frightening rage, methodically attacks model after model resting on shelves just below massive plate glass windows that frame downtown los angeles. steven gardner, who asked for his model without grass, rushes to within feet of george as he witness his creation deconstruct into shards of cardboard and plastic.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{mother of god! not my house!}
<A>__{george stops for a second to focus on steven, but steven is smart enough to run. george continues on with the business of disassembling his work.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{oh, please, please, no!}
<A>__{the plea is instantly followed by a pathetic low whine. george works up a sweat as he whacks model after model; portions of plastic walls or window splatter the office as though bombed in war. bryan burke's secretary inches as close as she dares.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{uh...mr. burke would like a word with you, george.}
<A>__{george lowers his stick as he faces her.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh...okay.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{in his office. when you're able.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{with that, george finishes what he began only minutes prior: the complete and utter destruction of every model displayed on every shelf in the office, save one. workers huddle together, collectively moaning and moving en mass from the mayhem. george picks up the sole surviving model in his arms and cradles it carefully as he walks into bryan burke's office.}
