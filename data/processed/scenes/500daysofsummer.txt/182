<C>__{summer}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{see you later.}

<L>__{int office waiting area day}
<A>__{tom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches at his side, waits in the foyer of allen, prince, and gethers architecture. from the room we can tell this firm is big time. tom waits. we notice, before he does, a very cute girl sitting in a another chair, also waiting. she smiles. he smiles back.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{are you here to interview?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{sorry?}

<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well, i hope you don't get it.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i hope you don't get it.}
<A>__{they both laugh. there's a silence for a few beats. and it's during this time that something weird comes over tom and we can visibly see it in his face. he likes the look of this girl. this girl is cute. he'd like to talk more with her. and, honestly, he's a little surprised by it.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{so, uh...}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{are you from...california?}

<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i, uh, don't know. i don't think so.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{do you go to st. patrick's? not to pray or anything but to stand outside?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i do! i love that church. it's like my favorite structure in the city.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{if only it wasn't near that horrible mirrored thing...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yes! exactly. i totally agree!}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think i've seen you there.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you have? really? hmm. i didn't see you.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{it happens. you probably weren't looking.}
<A>__{a man comes out.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{tom hansen?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{come on back.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he starts to go. but halfway through the doorway, he pauses and looks back at the girl.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{if tom had learned anything... it was that you can't ascribe great cosmic significance to a simple earthly event. coincidence. that's all anything ever is. nothing more than coincidence.}
<A>__{animation. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. real fast. hardly noticeable. but it's there.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{it took a long time but tom had finally learned. there are no miracles. there's no such thing as fate. nothing is meant to be. he knew. he was sure of it now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tom was...}
<A>__{tom turns back around.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{...pretty sure.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(to girl)}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{hello stranger.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{when this is over... uh... would you like to maybe...grab a cup of coffee or something?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{oh. i'm sorta supposed to meet someone.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(deflated)}
<D>__{oh. got it... no problem.}
<A>__{he turns back around and shakes that off, tries to refocus on the task at hand. a job interview. and then he hears.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{tom turns back around.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{great! so... i will wait for you here, or you wait for me or...something.}

<C>__{tom}
<D>__{ok!}
