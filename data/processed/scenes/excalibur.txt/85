<L>__{interior chapel day}
<A>__{uryens and morgana take their places near the altar. arthur and guenevere kneel before the bishop, and arthur takes her hand. the clatter of armor mingles with the enthusiastic, happy singing of the children, and seems to strengthen their song.}
<L>__{exterior site of the sword in the stone evening}
<A>__{the chorus carries across the field to the dark wall of trees from which issues another chorus, of hoots and squawks and howls. merlin advances along the edge of the forest. he stops by the stone that once held the sword, his eyes wild. he forgets his inner torment when he sees a plant at the base of the stone. he kneels beside it and plucks it. he admires its strange flowers; he smells them. two feet appear at his side. he rises to be face to face with morgana. they look deep into each other. then merlin breaks the silence.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{you left your husband's side? you left your brother's wedding?}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{is that mandrake, lord merlin?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{it is.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{can it truly be used for magic?}
<A>__{merlin smiles at last, and morgana does, her eyes piercing, cruel and lovely.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{yes... sometimes...}
<A>__{his gaze drifts toward the chapel.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{...there are many powers in this world.}
