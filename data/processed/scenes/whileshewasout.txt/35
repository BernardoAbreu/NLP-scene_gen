<L>__{interior mall evening}
<A>__{a wave of heat and christmas lights hits della. a wave of nausea follows as she is swallowed by the crowd of last minute shoppers. distorted muzak versions of christmas songs seep from invisible speakers. della gets caught up in a line of children waiting to see santa in his grotto. she squeezes through and makes her way towards the fountain outside of victoria's secret. en route she is stopped by a perfume sales lady who sprays her wrist with perfume before she has time to protest.}

<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{della arrives at the fountain. a piddling jet of dirty water gurgles from the mouth of a bored mermaid and streams down into the shallow pool full of nickels and dimes. she scans the crowd but there's no sign of cassie. della sits at the edge of the fountain. she checks her watch then checks out the people milling around in front of victoria's secret, where mannequins in skimpy festive underwear are propped seductively in the window displays. still no sign of cassie. she's about to make a wish and throw a quarter into the fountain when a red cross worker shakes her "save the children" tin at her. della sticks the quarter into the tin instead.}
