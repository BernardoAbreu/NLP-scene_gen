<L>__{exterior chair lift moments later}
<A>__{lynch feebly climbs up on the chair back and reaches up for the cables.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{ok....let's try this again.}
<A>__{he steadies himself on the chair, which sways in the wind. tight on the bolts connecting the arm to the cables. the metal is bending with a light squeaking sound.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{are you ok? do you have it?}
<A>__{lynch just grunts as he reaches and tries to steady himself on the chair that is swinging at an odd angle under his weight. the camera swivels up to reveal his shaky feet trying to find footing on the chair back and the ground far below him.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{rrruh!}
<A>__{he pushes off hard and grabs on to the cabling. as his foot pushes fast on the chair, it swings at an impossible angle. tight on the connecting bolts as one of them snaps!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{oh my god!}
<A>__{the chair leans hard to the right side, forcing parker to slide down into what is now the bottom corner of the chair. the chair is still in place, but it is now hanging by one bolt and at a severe angle.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{joe! joe!}
<A>__{joe tries to look back over his shoulder, struggling to keep himself on the cable against his own body weight and wet clothing.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{shit! hold on, just hold on!}
<A>__{another grunt and lynch makes another big move forward. the camera booms up above him, shooting straight down at the distance between his dangling body and the frozen ground. tight on his gloved hands as they slowly slide forward on the metal cable. lynch squeezes his eyes shut and takes another reach forward. behind him, parker looks on in agony. she is holding her breath and whispering...}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{please god...please god....please god...}
<A>__{the metal arm above her groans under the pressure that the one remaining bolt is under. looking at the arm in this state, it is especially eerie to imagine how these metal chairs even stay attached to the cables in the first place. lynch takes another move forward.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{rrrugh!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you can do it. please do it.}
<A>__{lynch reaches forward again...and his hand slips on the icy cable. he momentarily hangs by one arm.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{arrrrr!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{joe!}
<A>__{he reaches up and grabs hold again...his strength is weaning.}
<C>__{lynch}
<P>__{(through gritted teeth)}
<D>__{got it.}
<A>__{another few quick reaches forward and he is more than halfway across to the next chair. from lynch's point of view we can see his feet floating above the earth and hear the sound of his own heart beat. his own pained breathing fills his ears. it's only now that he sees two of the wolves watching him from the bushes.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{motherfucker.}
<A>__{the wind blows hard against him, swaying his body back and forth as he momentarily rests.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{i've got an audience.}
<B>__{e}
<A>__{parker looks down, just in time to see one of the wolves duck back into the bushes. her movement makes the chair groan harder. the cable twangs loudly between lynch's shaky movements and the twisted metal that holds the arm in place.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{the chair is gonna fall!}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{no. no it's not.}
<A>__{slowly he makes his way the remaining distance and positions himself over the other chair. he drops down onto it, sending shards of ice cascading down into the snow below. he quickly sits down, breathing heavy and clutching the sides of the chair.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{take that jenny bluth!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you made it!}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{not yet. halfway.}
<A>__{he looks behind him at the next chair. just a few feet back from it is the giant green lift pole... and a ladder!}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{he stands up on the chair and reaches up to the cable. he is weak. very weak.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{parker. i want you to throw my extra pole as far as you can this way.}
<A>__{she can't quite hear him.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what?}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i said throw my pole as far as you can this way. when i get on the ground i will need some defense.}
<A>__{parker nods. she takes lynch's ski pole and tries to throw it as far as she can back at him. the action forces another terrifying metallic groan from the arm above her, and her chair swings back and forth from the motion.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{oh shit.}
<A>__{the pole lands under the second chair, splitting the distance between where she is and where the tree is.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{hey. halfway to me is better than up there with you, right?}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{he starts to pull himself up again, but turns back to parker one more time. the chair has settled down.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{stay perfectly still. i'm gonna get you home, ok?}
<A>__{he pulls himself up, straining hard.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{rrrrugh!}
<A>__{this gets the wolves attention. in the bushes their ears and eyes perk up to the sky, watching their potential next meal grapple with the high wire cable. with reserved strength, lynch shimmies across the cable as quickly as he can. back at parker's chair, she eyes the bending metal bolt that}
<B>__{e}
<A>__{is keeping her from plunging to the ground. tears stream down her face again.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{please god, don't let me fall. don't let me fall.}
<A>__{he stops once to catch his breath, but begins moving as quickly as possible. finally, he reaches the second chair behind them and drops down into it. looking at the lift pole from this position, he can clearly see that it wasn't as close to the chair as it looked. but it's possible.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{parker needs to yell to hear him now.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{he assesses the situation. it's going to take a big leap to try and get near the ladder and he is winded beyond belief.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{nothing. i'm gonna go for it, ok?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{...}
<C>__{lynch}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{the two stare at each other from the distance. both of their weather beaten faces are a mess. parker is buried in the corner of the chair closest to the ground, holding on to the back of it to keep herself steady. stoically, lynch turns away from her and takes a deep breath. he climbs up onto the chair back and looks down. parker closes her eyes and prays. the wolves below do not break their stare. their hungry eyes are willing lynch to fall from the chair. it's now or never.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{yaaaaugh!}
<A>__{he throws himself off of the chair and towards the ladder! he lands and hooks his arm around a rung. with a snap his arm dislocates from it's socket, but he is hooked on to the ladder!}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{rrrrugh!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you did it! you did it!}
<A>__{with his bad arm dangling by his side, lynch works his way down the icy metal ladder. finally he reaches the ground and his body falls with a thud into the snow.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{oooof!}
<A>__{the wolves' ears are at attention. they watch carefully from the safety of the bushes. one, the leader, takes a cautious single step forward and waits.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{lynch!? lynch!!!}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{answer me!!!}
<A>__{the wolf leader begins a dangerously slow and cautious walk towards lynch's body. one step at a time.}
