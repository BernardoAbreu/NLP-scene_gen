<A>__{rusty and danny nod reluctantly.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{you said we could show him the painting right, to prove that we had it.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{he still wouldn't trade.}
<A>__{yen says something.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we need to teach him a lesson.}
<C>__{turk}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{all right, let's stay calm. we don't need to over react here. he said some disrespectful things, that's true. but why antagonize this guy? why get into something with him? he's young and he's filthy rich, and he's got time on his hands. we don't want to become his betty noir. we can just fence his painting and earn a lot more than we would have from the certificate.}
<C>__{basher}
<D>__{it's about reputation. you said so yourself. we have to get that certificate to evelyn's buyer or }
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{we'll make enough selling the degas to pay off her buyer }

<D>__{turn his name over to isabel. in exchange for getting off our backs.}
<A>__{tough one to swallow.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{short of that...the only appropriate response is to steal his next job right out from under him. just like he did to us.}
<C>__{turk}
<D>__{we don't even know our next job.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{we got ten million in that closet.}
<A>__{danny points at the closet in the room.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i cash in the degas, take a moment to think about our next move. toulour isn't going anywhere. you guys are hyping him too much, you're letting him get inside your head.}
<A>__{everyone agrees. danny opens the closet. there's a picture frame in there, but no picture. it's been stolen by toulour. we hear the sound of a case being shut and locked.}
