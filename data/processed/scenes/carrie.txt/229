<L>__{195 angle tommy and carrie's table}
<A>__{as norma watson haughtily drops a ballot on their table in front of tommy, another in front of george. carrie examines the paper.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{tommy...}
<P>__{(looking up to see him smiling at her)}
<D>__{...we're on here!}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(seeing her concern)}
<D>__{want to decline?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{do you want to?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{hell, no. if you win, all you do is sit up there for the school song and one dance. and they put your picture in the yearbook so everyone can see we looked like idiots. besides, it's the last year.}
<A>__{carrie looks up at the stage at the massive thrones all in white.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{they're beautiful.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you're beautiful.}
<A>__{carrie meets his eyes and blushes; it's all overwhelming her, and she has to look away at the tiny party favor boat on the table in front of her, at the tiny pencil next to it.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{who do we vote for? they're more your crowd than mine.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{whatever you like.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{in fact, i don't really have a crowd.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{let's vote for ourselves. to the devil with false modesty.}
<A>__{she laughs aloud the sound of her own laughter is so foreign to her that she claps a hand over her mouth, at her own daring. she takes the pencil and quickly circles their names so quickly that the pencil breaks, bringing a small drop of blood to her finger. she gasps.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{hurt yourself?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(trying to smile)}
<D>__{but i broke it and it was a souvenir.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{there's still your boat.}
<P>__{(he pushes it gently toward her)}
<D>__{toot, toot.}
