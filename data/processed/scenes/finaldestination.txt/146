<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior cabin night}
<A>__{the windows are boarded. the front steps are worn and dilapidated. in the early evening moonlight, the dwelling appears eerie and ghostly. camera creeps toward the house, a pre storm breeze swaying branches and blowing leaves. in the distance... lightning...}
<L>__{interior cabin day a small table}
<A>__{a final piece of duct tape is applied to the corner of the table, dulling any sharp edges. even though it is sunny outside, all the shades are pulled. the room sits in dark shadows broken by occasional bright shafts of light. camera follows a hand as it carefully picks up a coleman lantern and sets it atop an empty can placed in the center and above the water line of a large metal tub; a fire protection moat.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{finds his way to a chair in the center of the room, away from everything except a nearby table holding a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit, both at less than arm's reach. unshaven, a week and a half's growth, and unkept, alex looks horrible. an anxious zombie, especially in the dim glow of the lantern. dark circles, from lack of sleep. thin, from lack of food. pale, from lack of sunlight. he places workman's gloves on his hands before picking up a can of underwood chicken spread. with some degree of difficulty, he works the gloves beneath the tab and pulls. careful not to cut himself, he reaches out and drops the lid into a small trash can. alex removes the gloves and, with a plastic spoon, begins to eat. camera pushes in as he begins to chew methodically, chewing and chewing and chewing with concentration until... after steadying himself... prepares to swallow... then, carefully does. pause... he's alright. he takes the spoon. scoops some more. and the process begins again.}
