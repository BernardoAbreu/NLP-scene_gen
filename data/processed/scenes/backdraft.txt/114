<A>__{rimgale's there, crouched excitedly beside a trash can that's lid's been sealed closed. he tamps a piece of putty on the rim and backs away.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{take the top off. go ahead. take it off.}
<A>__{brian walks over and rips off the lid. instantly a tongue of flame shoots straight up past his head and blows out.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{jesus!}
<A>__{rimgale's grinning like a little kid.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{that's it! oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! you see what this tells us, huh? our killer doesn't love fire!}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{shadow}
<P>__{(pulls out file)}
<D>__{i got it after we talked to ronald. torches. want to fry the whole goddamn world. but the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. the burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. and he made his burns backdrafts.}
<P>__{([p. 78])}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{but he killed these guys.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{but he could have killed everybody there. the firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. the backdraft blew out the flame. that's it. that's the reason.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{what reason?}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{why backdrafts. whoever fried seagrave and cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{that's why the sealant on the doors... so what have we got, a torch with a conscience?}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{no, we have a stone killer trying to make a pointerior}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{are you going public with this?}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{no. do that and i guarantee you'll scare him off. i don't want him running away.}
