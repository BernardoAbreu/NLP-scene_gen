<L>__{int: jamestown slum, tenement, hallway day}
<T>__{crash cut :}
<A>__{to the door of the building swinging open wildly, a hand held camera on the shoulder of lilly and jones. a large, grubby looking woman stands in a long, grim hallway, mop in hand. at the far end of the hall another door disconnects from its hinges and collapses inwards, two men appearing out of the rain.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(to the woman)}
<D>__{don't you move!}
<A>__{we see a gun in jones' hand as he moves towards the woman, who has her hands up and is getting down on her knees. the camera then pans wildly, left and right. then lilly's foot kicks in a door to our right, revealing a dank office and a man, half naked, reaching for a gun. a woman is lying on a cot and she's screaming. she is instantly recognizable as a prostitute.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(to the slum landlord)}
<D>__{don't you dare.}
<A>__{from this pov we see lilly's hand pointing a gun at the slum landlord, who is now slowly easing back into the scummy office.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{jones!}
<A>__{we now finally cut to see lilly. she is around 25; an intelligent, handsome 25. the man jones appears at her shoulder, leering. jones is the type of guy you just know will go to seed at 40. but that's still 10 years away. jones stares at the slum landlord who is trying to cover himself.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{god help us. what an appalling sight.}
