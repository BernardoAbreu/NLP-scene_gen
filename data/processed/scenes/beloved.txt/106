<L>__{exterior river bank oak tree night.}
<A>__{a thunderstorm cracks across the sky and floods the river. sethe is sitting beneath the oak the rain soaking her as she breast feeds her baby. she cries out loud but her sobs and tears are lost in the rain and thunder.}
<L>__{exterior riverbank later that day.}
<A>__{sethe walks downriver with denver tied to her chest. she stops when she sees: a flatbed gliding down river. she can't make out if they're white people or not, so she hides behind a tree until it passes; waiting behind the tree, we see that sethe is sweating a fever. but denver seems to be doing fine. she sees the flatbed pass her and continues on her way. she sees; three colored people an older man and two boys fishing. she approaches cautiously. one of the boys is the first to see her. sethe's bloody and torn clothes and her feverish face make her quite a sight to the young boy. he taps the old man on the shoulder and motions for him to turn around. the old man takes in sethe and instantly knows where she's been and why she's there.}

<A>__{stamp paid raises his hand to stop her. he looks around to see that no one else is in sight, then motions for her to sit on a rock. as she does, he gets a water jug and hands it to her she drinks like a madman in the desert. the boys watch in fascination. stamp paid turns to one of them and says:}
