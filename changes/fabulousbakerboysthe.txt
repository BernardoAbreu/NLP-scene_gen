<ACTION>__{It's the GIRL from this afternoon.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey.}
<ACTION>__{Jack looks at the Girl, sleepy and warm under the bedcovers, then at the rest of the apartment. Not good.}

<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<ACTION>__{The Girl doesn't appear terribly unnerved by this.}
<CHAR>__{GIRL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(at the tux)}
<DIAL>__{You weren't wearing that, were you? Earlier.}
<ACTION>__{Jack shakes his head, taps a brown paper bag on the sill.}

<CHAR>__{GIRL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(as he stops)}
<DIAL>__{You got great hands.}
<LOC>__{EXT.  STREET - JACK}
<ACTION>__{Jack ain't exactly Cary Grant, but any guy wearing a tux on these streets doesn't exactly mesh with the milieu.  Pausing for a flask of whiskey at an all-night liquor store, he breaks the seal before he hits the sidewalk and moves on, drinking as he goes.  Finally, he comes to a nice downtown hotel. Slipping the bottle in his coat, he squints up at the glittering building as if sizing up an opponent.}
<CHAR>__{DOORMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, Jackie!}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How goes it, Tommy?}

<DIAL>__{Losing his teeth.}
<CHAR>__{TOMMY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(standing back)}
<DIAL>__{Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.}
<ACTION>__{Tommy brushes at his new velvet coat.}
<CHAR>__{TOMMY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Another five years, huh?}
<CHAR>__{TOMMY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?}
<CHAR>__{TOMMY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(nodding)}
<DIAL>__{He's got blood in his eye.}
<ACTION>__{Jack glances at his watch, waves to Tommy, and moves into the hotel.}
<LOC>__{INT.  HOTEL - ANGLE ON FRANK}
<ACTION>__{Jack's older brother, FRANK, is pacing outside the lounge when he sees Jack approaching.}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How we doing?}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Am I late?}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's not the point.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(taking out a cigarette)}
<DIAL>__{What's the point?}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You want me to show up late a few nights?}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jack.}

<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Christ, will you look at your hair?}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANOTHER ANGLE}
<ACTION>__{Jack turns to the wall, which is paneled in tiny tinted mirrors shot through with veins of gold.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What's wrong with it?}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You look like you just crawled out of bed.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.}
<ACTION>__{Frank just stands there, bottled up with exasperation.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(continuing)}
<DIAL>__{Careful, Frank.  When you get angry your tie starts to spin.}
<ACTION>__{Jack steps into the lounge and Frank, shaking his head, follows.  As they move away, a cardboard stand-up is revealed.  On it are two 8 X 10 glossies of Frank and Jack, and below printed in bold letters, this: "Tonight!  The Doubly Delightful Tones of the Fabulous Baker Boys!"}
<ACTION_ALT>__{BAKER BROTHERS}
<ACTION>__{as they make their way through the dimly-lit lounge and settle behind matching pianos, it becomes apparent that what the "Fabulous Baker Boys" are, in fact, is a poor man's version of Ferrante and Teicher.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{WIDER ANGLE INCLUDING LOUNGE}
<ACTION>__{As they begin to plink out their "theme song" tables of middle-aged couples sipping enormous banana daiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads. After a few bars, the boys finish with a flourish and the couples applaud.}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Mr.  Smile)}
<DIAL>__{Thank you.  Thank you.  Good evening and welcome to the Starfire lounge.  My name is Frank Baker and eighty-eight keys across from me is my little brother, Jack.}
<ACTION>__{Applause.  Little brother Jack smiles, winks, and takes a draw on his cigarette.}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(continuing; could do this in his sleep)}
<DIAL>__{You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Twenty-eight years, Frank.}
<ACTION>__{Applause.}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Lotta water.}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Jack)}
<DIAL>__{We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?}
<ACTION>__{Laughter. Jack smiles like he's got a mouth full of razor blades.}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(continuing)}
<DIAL>__{But seriously.  It's been fifteen years since Jack and I first stepped on the stage as professionals. Three states, sixty-eight cities, and more-grayhairs-then-we'd-like-to-admit later... well, believe me, we've seen our share of this crazy country of ours.  But even though we've played some of the finest venues in the world ...}
<ACTION>__{At this point, Jack begins to mimic his brother's words.}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(continuing)}
<DIAL>__{... There's one place that's always been, for us, a very special place, and that place is... this place, the Starfire lounge.}
<ACTION>__{Jack lays in a few soft bass chords.}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(continuing)}
<DIAL>__{Why?  Well, I guess you could just say it's the ...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pregnant moment)}
<DIAL>__{... people.}
<ACTION>__{At which point Frank's hands descend onto the keyboard and give birth to the melody of -- what else?  "People.' JACK AND FRANK - LATER They exit the stage to applause.}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you.  Remember, room service is available}
<ACTION>__{till one A.M. for you late-nighters.}

<DIAL>__{Who's gonna make trouble?}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(as they exit)}
<DIAL>__{I mean it, Jack.  Behave.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Like an angel.}
<LOC>__{INT.  OFFICE}
<ACTION>__{Frank stands across the desk from a YOUNG MAN who, despite his youth, has an irritatingly paternal attitude toward the two men in his office.  Jack stays in the doorway, smoking a cigarette, as if to venture any further is to risk contracting some hideous disease.}
<CHAR>__{LLOYD } <CHAR_PAR>__{(YOUNG MAN)}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(preparing a cash envelope)}
<DIAL>__{Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.}

<DIAL>__{Uh ... thanks.}

<CHAR>__{LLOYD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Only, Jack, do me a favor, will ya, pal?  If you wanna smoke, put on a pair of sunglasses and go play with the niggers on State Street.  These blisters from the midwest don't wanna watch some guy dripping ash all over himself while he's playing 'The Sound of Music.'}
<ACTION>__{ANGLE - JACK Smoke curls out of Jack's nose.  He is utterly still, like a pit bull eyeing a steak.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{BACK TO SCENE}
<CHAR>__{LLOYD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more}
<ACTION>__{lessons.  By the way, Frankie, I'm declaring this. Lloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk and, business closed, busies himself with other matters.}

<DIAL>__{Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us}
<ACTION>__{back, do you, Lloyd?}

<DIAL>__{It's all here.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pulling Jack out)}
<DIAL>__{I'll be talking to you, Lloyd.}

<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Fuck him.}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.}

<DIAL>__{So we on tomorrow night?}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(shaking his head)}
<DIAL>__{Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.}

<DIAL>__{You're their uncle.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You got weird kids, Frank.}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.}

<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(continuing;like a litany)}
<DIAL>__{You want a ride, Jack?  No, Frank, I'll walk.  Okay, Jack, good night. Good night, Frank.}
<ACTION>__{Frank turns the ENGINE OVER and pulls away from the curb. Jack watches the taillights burn into the distance, then takes the whiskey bottle from his coat and heads for home. ANGLE - APARTMENT BUILDING Jack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment building, where a black labrador is studying him from a second story window.}
<LOC>__{INT.  JACK'S APARTMENT}
<ACTION>__{Jack's apartment is small, old, and comfortably cluttered.  The most striking item is a vintage phone booth placed against the wall.  As Jack lets himself in, EDDIE, the dog from the window, walks over.  He is not an overly enthusiastic dog, but you can see from his face that he has a great deal of affection for Jack.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hi, pal.  Thought you were gonna clean the apartment.}
<ACTION>__{Eddie nuzzles the soup bone.  Jack unwraps the paper and hands it over.}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(continuing)}
<DIAL>__{Take it easy, will ya?  You're becoming a regular Johhny Appleseed the way you're dropping teeth around here.}
<ACTION>__{Jack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over to an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs. He lifts the records back up the post and clicks ON the MACHINE.  As Bill Evans' smoky "PEACE PIECE" fills the tiny apartment, Jack breaks the collar of his shirt and walks over to the old piano near the window.  Settling back with the bottle of whiskey, Jack rests his elbows gently on the keys and stares out the open window, listening to the music.}
<LOC>__{INT.  PIANO STORE}
<ACTION>__{Jack and Frank work opposite sides of a large piano showroom, inspecting rentals of every style and color. WILLIE, the owner of the place, leans against a cheap upright, contemplating his shoes.}

<DIAL>__{What do you think?}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Try the black Knable.}
<ACTION>__{Frank moves to another piano and repeats the process, watching Jack for a verdict. After a moment, Jack nods.}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{WILLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{My pleasure.}

<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why the interest?}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.}

This and all else in the room Jack confronts slowly, warily, but with a noticeable dispassion, until his eyes fall upon a photograph. In it, he and Frank are standing alonside a tall man in baggy slacks, safe within the arc of his long arms.

<LOC>__{EXT.  STREET}
<ACTION>__{Jack is standing across the street from his mother's house, just looking.  After a moment, he crosses the street.  As he moves up the drive, he takes notice of the tree growing in the front yard and crosses to it, kneeling by the trunk and studying the scars there -- cat's claws -- running vertically up the tree, the damage smoothed and widened by time.  He runs his fingers over the imperfection, then stands and walks toward the house.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(continuing)}
<DIAL>__{Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.}

<DIAL>__{Sure.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(surprised)}

<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah?}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?}
<CHAR>__{JACK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<ACTION>__{Jack and Frank lock eyes again. Frank's glance drops to Jack's glass.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(singing)}
<DIAL>__{She comes on like a dream Peaches and cream Lips like strawberry wine She's sixteen, she's beautiful and she's mine. Ribbons and curls Ooh, what a girl Eyes that sparkle and shine You're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine.}
<ACTION>__{As Jack and Frank finish, they're laughing.  After a moment, their voices die and the house is quiet again. Full of ghosts.  Each stares at the tiny keyboard before him, awkward with the intimacy of the moment.  It is quiet for a very long time.  Finally, Frank looks over.}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well ... One more time?}
<ACTION>__{Jack glances up and sees Frank has his empty glass held out.  He hesitates, then picks up the bottle.}

<DIAL>__{One more time.}
