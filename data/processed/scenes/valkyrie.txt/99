<A>__{security perimeter i. keitel and his men file through the heavily guarded entrance. each man holds up his pass for the guards to inspect. stauffenberg is last. keitel heads toward a wooden structure up ahead away from the bunker. stauffenberg is confused.}

<D>__{where are they going?}
<C>__{freyend}
<D>__{it's too hot. the briefing has been moved to the conference hut.}
<A>__{angle on: the conference hut. the door and many windows of the flimsy wooden structure are all open. not ideal for generating the deadly air pressure vital to stauffenberg's plan. but this obstacle only seems to strengthen his resolve. he is a soldier after all. and no military operation goes according to plan. making matters worse:}
<C>__{freyend }
<D>__{sir, your briefcase. i insist.}
<A>__{annoyed but not wanting to arouse suspicion, stauffenberg finally acquiesces, handing it over. he watches freyend carry the bomb into the hut. pause. stauffenberg looks back over his shoulder to: fellgiebel standing by the communications building. the man who will get stauffenberg out of the room before the bomb goes off. they share a nod. then stauffenberg steps into the hut.}
