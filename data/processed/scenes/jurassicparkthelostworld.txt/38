<L>__{exterior base camp later}
<A>__{later, and base camp is a blur of activity. sarah, juttson, nick, and eddie are hard at work, burying the remains of the fire, sealing their food in plastic bags, loading camera equipment, packing up specimen containers and other information gathering equipment. malcolm, meanwhile, is lecturing kelly.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. you don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(loading a backpack)}
<D>__{what do you want to do, ian, lock her up for curiosity? where do you think she gets it?}
<C>__{juttson}
<P>__{(to nick)}
<D>__{do you have chromium tapes? the others fog in high }
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{ humidity, i know.}
<P>__{(waving a tape)}
<D>__{highest lead density on the market.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(to malcolm)}
<D>__{we've got a lot of heavy marching ahead of us. i'm not carrying anybody.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i can keep up.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you're going home. i'm sending a radio call for the boats. we'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{lighten up, ian, you sound like a high school vice principal.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i'm her father.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{sure, now.}
<A>__{nick leans over and whispers to eddie, gesturing to malcolm and kelly.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{do you see any family resemblance here?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you can't stay, kelly, that's it. it's too dangerous.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{if it's so dangerous, why'd you bring any of us?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you're wrong, dad. i do know what's going on on this island.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{how could you possibly?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{because you said so. maybe nobody else believed you, but i always did.}
<A>__{he looks at her, touched. nick mutters to eddie again.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{the kid scores with cheap sentiment.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day. that'll have to go in any paper i write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated. you know the academic world as well as i do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead. our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic. that means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it }
<A>__{a low sound has been rising while she speaks, and now it comes booming over the jungle around them, a thunderous racket that shakes the very ground beneath them. suddenly, three c 130 military cargo planes thunder overhead and roar toward the island interior, flying very low. the planes are enormous, fat assed creatures, their rear cargo doors hanging open. at a ridge, the members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer over a ledge, watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a specific spot. eddie raises a pair of field glasses. down below, huge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the cargo bays. they snap off trees like matchsticks, crush flat anything foolish enough to exist where they want to land. now men pour out the rear of the planes, their low altitude parachutes billowing open behind them. up on the ridge, nick looks at sarah.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you were saying something about antiseptic?}
