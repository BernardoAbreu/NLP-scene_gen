<A>__{low angle on the joker. he stands on a catwalk high above the refinery floor, lord of all he surveys, overseeing production like a demented middle manager.}
<L>__{interior storeroom day}
<A>__{a dank, windowless room in the bowels of ace chemical, which the joker has converted into a makeshift lair. sap like goo drips in puddles from exposed pipes overhead. camera drifts across the joker's cluttered desk. shipping manifests. ledgers. psychotic doodles scrawled in crayon. more significantly: an old contract dating back to the mid seventies. it's half obscured by other papers, but the initials 'cia' are plainly visible. then: a bound report with the title 'ddid nerve gas: results of preliminary experimentation.' across its title and finally: a sheaf of photos. laboratory apes, chimps and orangutans, all dead. their lips are drawn back, exposing hideous, chemical induced grimaces. on one wall: poster sized blowups of the grinning apes. on the opposite wall: a large scale photographic reproduction of the gotham city skyline, its bottom half hidden from view by the joker's desk. the phone rings. the joker who has been sitting on the floor by the cityscape pops into frame and picks it up.}

<D>__{how's that first shipment coming?}
<C>__{voice on phone}
<D>__{right on schedule. oh, we got that address for you 79 east end, #12 c.}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{mmm. how'd you find it?}
<C>__{voice on phone}
<D>__{called her agent.}
<A>__{the joker nods in satisfaction and resumes his place on the floor. like a happy kindergartener, with paste pot and scissors, he's clipping photos from a magazine horrible scenes of death, destruction, panic, mutilation. one by one, he's pasting these shots on the blowup of gotham city all along sidewalk level creating a massive photomontage of anarchy in the streets. we've seen these photos before. vicki vale took them... in corto maltese.}
