<L>__{interior deacon's bedroom day}
<A>__{deacon wakes up sick as a dog. all the shades are drawn, but fred and matt are already hard at work on the computer. they seem completely fine, with no signs of deacon's hangover.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{what are you guys doing?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{we came up with a great idea. we're going to presell the videos by posting the scripts on the website.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{will that work?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i don't know. but it's kind of fun. we just wrote this whole thing about the girls' locker room.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{one thing, though. if our motto is "by virgins, for virgins," i was thinking we should put a picture of one of us on the web site to sort of sell the image.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you're not putting my picture up there.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{it doesn't really have to be one of us, though, does it?}
<A>__{he grabs the yearbook.}
