<A>__{ock is honking the horn. something lands on his roof. then spidey sticks his head, upside down, in the windshield.}

<C>__{ock}
<D>__{you!!!}
<A>__{a waldo smashes through the windshield but misses spidey. ock leaps from the car.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(on the run)}
<D>__{you're a doomed bug, wall crawler. i've no time to waste on you now.}
<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{ock runs through honking traffic. spider man leaps from car to car. ock turns to see spider man leap to a limo at the curb. ock turns tail and runs down an alley. a female cop pops out of a doorway. her partner, a big, young cop, pulls his gun.}
<C>__{female cop}
<P>__{(gun poised)}
<D>__{alright! freeze! up against the wall and spread 'em}
<A>__{ock complies. he raises his hands... and spreads the waldos to full extension! the big cop screams and faints. the little female cop's eyes pop. ock swats the gun from her hand. he starts to choke her. spidey comes swinging to the rescue. he lands on the roof nearby.}
<D>__{spider man hey, you big ock, why don't you pick on someone your own size?!}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{alright spider bug... here i've come for you...}
<A>__{ock leaves the cop and attacks spider man, shooting his iron fist at him. ock runs to the end of the alley. spidey staggers to his feet and resumes the chase. ock breaks into a red corvette convertible, starting it with a waldo. spider man comes out in time to see the vette drive away. a chinese laundry truck is passing. spidey thwips it and is whipped away. he crawls over to the window.}
<D>__{spider man hey, driver. could you follow that red vette for me?}
<A>__{the surprised chinaman lets loose a stream of chinese expletives, complete with appropriate suggestive gestures. spider man crawls to the top of the truck and surveys the situation. he sees a sea of moving traffic. he thwips up a web and swings away. spidey swings along from building to building. the red vette is making headway. suddenly, spider man spots a blue mg with its top up.}
<D>__{spider man}
<P>__{(swinging)}
<D>__{flash thompson... i never thought i'd be happy to see you.}
