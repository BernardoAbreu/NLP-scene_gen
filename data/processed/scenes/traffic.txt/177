<A>__{helena enters the room. she hits a desk lamp and we're in a very comfortable and masculine upstairs study: bookshelves holding hundreds of art books; comfortable chairs; macintosh stereo; discreet flatscreen hd tv. helena stares at a painting on one of the bookshelves. it is "boy with a hoop," a small portrait by rafael colonel. she goes to it and looks from different angles. she reaches out and jiggles the oil. nothing happens. she looks behind the painting at the backing. she notices that one corner is not glued down. she picks up a letter opener and pries the paper back. an envelope slips out. inside the envelope: neat, thin strips of paper dense with information in a miniscule type and a magnetic key card.}
