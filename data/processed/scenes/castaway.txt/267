<L>__{exterior hawaii day}
<A>__{chuck's raft sits up on a dock. kelly stands staring at it. how small and fragile it looks.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{this stinks really bad.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you should have smelled me.}
<A>__{stan examines the ropes around the logs.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{cool ropes.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i braided them.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{must have taken a hell of a long time.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{time i had lots of.}
<A>__{kelly points at something on the raft.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{that's my sea anchor. my second one. made it out of part of the sail. it keeps you from capsizing in a storm. in theory.}
<P>__{(picks up his still)}
<D>__{and this, this i used to collect water. about half a cup a day.}
<A>__{he's not feeling sorry for himself. it's just a fact.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you were how long on this?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{forty three days.}
<A>__{they look at the tiny raft. it speaks for itself.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{all that time i waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{yeah, well...couldn't be helped.}
<A>__{kelly notices the sail, sees the writing on it.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what's that, written on the sail?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{my epitaph.}
<A>__{kelly reads it to herself. her eyes are moist.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{bad body chemistry. made me a little morbid. but i'm all over that now.}
<A>__{and he seems really to believe it.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i will be at the car.}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{take you to the airport.}
<A>__{and he leaves.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i buried you, chuck. they had to pry my fingers off your coffin.}
<A>__{this interests chuck to no end.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{there was a coffin?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what was inside?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{that about sums it up.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{maybe now's when you tell me about it.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{the plane went down. my friends died. i washed up on an island. then i found these barrels, built the raft, and here i am.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{the tide came in, the tide went out. i survived. that's the headline. i survived.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{don't overwhelm me with the details.}
<P>__{(she smiles remembering)}
<D>__{you know how i hate that.}
<A>__{he tries to put it into words, isn't quite sure how.}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{come on. try.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{cliches, mainly. don't take anyone for granted. don't sweat the small stuff. live each day like it's your last.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{so simple to say, so hard to do.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{not when you have no choice.}
<A>__{kelly looks down at the raft. it's so small.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you hated being alone. couldn't stand it. busy every minute. always plugged into something.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i didn't know what really being alone was. no one back here does.}
<A>__{he has something more to say. she waits.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{we're not meant to be alone. not like that. share life, that's what came to me out there. be with someone.}
<A>__{and that's the point, isn't it? we are social animals. no man is an island.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{this is so unfair.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{that's what i told the fish i caught. but i ate them anyway.}
<A>__{and the laughter comes again. kelly grins, embarrassed, a little worried.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{great. really.}
<A>__{she stares at his face, reaches out, touches it again, this time with great tenderness. he nods, her touch feels so good. a wave of emotion comes over her: pity? love?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what will you do?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i don't know. i really don't know.}
<A>__{we hear a distant beep beep, discrete as a car horn can be.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i've got to get back to memphis. hannah's babysitter has finals.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{it means a lot...that you came.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i had to come. to be sure you were okay.}
<A>__{they hold each other. for a long time.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i love you, chuck.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you too.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i'm so glad you're alive.}
<A>__{chuck grins.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you too.}
<A>__{then she heads for the waiting car. chuck stands by his raft, watching her go.}
