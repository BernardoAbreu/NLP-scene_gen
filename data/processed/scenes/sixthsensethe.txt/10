<L>__{interior church day}
<A>__{only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews. malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what he's looking for in the last row of the church. he moves down the center aisle towards the back. malcolm finds cole playing in his pew with a set of green and beige plastic soldiers. cole makes the soldiers talk to each other.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{pro... fun... add...}
<A>__{the words are unintelligible. cole senses someone. he looks up and sees malcolm staring at him. the boy immediately goes white. every cell of his body still with fear.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it's okay, cole. don't be frightened.}
<A>__{cole stays rigid. hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen.}
<C>__{malcolm}

<A>__{malcolm waits for a response. none comes.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{do you mind if i sit down? i have this injury from a couple of years ago and it flares up every once in a while just so i won't forget it.}
<A>__{beat. cole slowly slides down the pew, giving malcolm most of the seat. malcolm sits. cole fidgets with his soldiers. beat. malcolm looks over and stares at cole's glasses. he leans forward to inspect them more carefully.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{your eye frames. they don't seem to have any lenses in them.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{they're my dad's. the lenses hurt my eyes.}
<C>__{malcolm}

<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{all your soldiers speak latin?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{no, just one.}
<A>__{malcolm smiles at cole. his eyes drift down to cole's arms. malcolm's smile slowly disappears. cole's arms are covered in tiny cuts and bruises. some almost healed. some fresh. malcolm looks around to gather himself. beat.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i like churches, too.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{in olden times, in europe, people used to hide in churches. claim sanctuary.}

<C>__{cole}
<D>__{what were they hiding from?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{oh, lots of things, i suppose. bad people for one. people who wanted to imprison them. hurt them.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{nothing bad can happen in a church, right?}
<A>__{malcolm studies cole's anxious face.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{malcolm and cole just stare at each other.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i forgot your name.}

<D>__{are you a good doctor?}
<A>__{malcolm smiles.}

<D>__{and cole, next time i won't be late for you.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{next time i won't be scared of you.}
<A>__{cole turns and starts to the rear of the church. malcolm loses himself in his thoughts. when malcolm looks back, he sees cole stop by the exit doors and take a tiny statue of jesus off the back table. cole pockets the statue and quietly leaves the church. malcolm just sits and stares.}
