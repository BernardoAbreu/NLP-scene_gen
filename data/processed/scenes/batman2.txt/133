<L>__{interior elevator car that moment}
<A>__{pitch black. pre verbal groans and murmurings of fear issue from the darkness. an eerie red light kicks on the emergency generators and we see provost backed up in a corner of the car, twitching and jumping like a crazed spastic. the guard, in a futile effort to placate him, points up at the light:}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{there. mr. provost. see? the generator's kicked in. it's just an electrical problem.}
<A>__{provost is only marginally consoled. they hear a strange twittering noise in the shaft above them... provost starts babbling again. the guard slaps him across the face. but the twittering has him a bit concerned as well. he stares up at the ceiling of the car as he punches buttons on the panel; with another lurch, the car begins to move.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{there. see? it's moving. we're fine.}
<C>__{provost}
<D>__{it's going down. we're going down!!!}
