<L>__{exterior abandoned church orphanage afternoon}
<A>__{a once exemplary church, now boarded up, neglected. gothic in style, it stands with deserted brownstones and empty lots of rubble as neighbors. smokestacks spew smoke distantly. cars and trucks drive by on a nearby elevated highway, but down here on the street it's a ghost town. there's a building attached to the rear of the church. somerset's car is parked beside it.}
<L>__{interior abandoned orphanage, classroom afternoon}
<A>__{the windows are covered over. somerset and father bleeker move through. somerset has a flashlight with a wide beam. the room is empty except for broken, cob web covered school desks and a few file cabinets. there are cracked blackboards on the walls. rats skitter away from the light. somerset opens a file cabinet drawer. it's empty. he walks to a door, starts pulling at the rotting boards which seal it shut.}
