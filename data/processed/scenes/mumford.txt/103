<L>__{exterior neighborhood street sunrise}
<A>__{mumford and sofie are delivering newspapers in lovely first light. mumford has a canvas sack full of newspapers around his neck. at each house, he consults the list in his hand, then hands sofie a rolled up paper, which she throws with varying success toward the front doors. the activity is tiring for her, but she's committed.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{...so we get on this incredible steam engine train that runs up into the mountains...}
<P>__{(she tosses a paper, grunting)}
<D>__{...and this trip is everything it's cracked up to be... an open car, great views, the mountain air blowing through. we're sitting there, married for six years, and he says how he likes it better when i put my hair back...}
<A>__{mumford hands her another paper, which she heaves with all her limited strength, missing the front porch badly. mumford, who can't get enough of watching her, doesn't notice at first.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{that wasn't so good.}
<A>__{mumford snaps out of it. he goes up on the lawn and flips the paper deftly onto the porch. as they continue }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you're doing great.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{i don't know if i'm going to make it the whole way.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. go on.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. well, i was so... tired of it.}
<P>__{(memories)}
<D>__{seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... i'm just not getting it right. can we rest for a second?}
<A>__{she leans against the iron handrail on some front steps, breathing hard.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{you're purposely making me talk while we do this...}
<P>__{(mumford nods)}
<D>__{...because you think this is good for me...}
<P>__{(nods again)}
<D>__{...and you're a sadistic bastard...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the roto rooter.}
<A>__{she laughs. they're playing with each other.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{that was really bad, wasn't it?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{disgusting.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{and i will bet you can interpret the whole thing}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{it's pretty obvious to a trained professional.}
<A>__{sofie starts walking again, taking another newspaper from his sack. he points to the next house.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{i hate those dreams where everything means something.}
<A>__{sofie heaves the paper squarely onto the porch. she turns to him with pride, but when she sees the way he looks at her, she glances away, uncomfortable.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{is that when you split up?}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{no, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. we went on for another year or so.}
<A>__{mumford hands her another paper and indicates the next house.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{so whose route is this?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{brady peck's. fourteen years old. lives next door.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{and he's where?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{in the capitol for boy's nation. five days. why?}
<C>__{sofie}
<P>__{(heaves another paper)}
<D>__{i'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. how hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you like it?}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{it's all right.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{and this is legitimate therapy?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{therapy? hell no, i just don't want to do it alone.}
