<L>__{interior. the bedroom}
<A>__{charlie standing by the window, is picking up his keys, a few dollar bills, a comb, etc., from a chair and putting them into his trouser pockets. the blinds of the bedroom window have been opened, and the high august sun streams in, whitening charlie's face. after he has pocketed his odds and ends, he moves to the chest of drawers on which, among all sorts of other things, there are several textbooks and an opened notebook. he stands a moment looking down into the open notebook, his lips moving ever so little, as he commits some of his notes to memory. he turns a page of the notebook back to check something and then goes back to the previous page. now he opens one of the smaller drawers in the chest of drawers. the drawer contains wisps of his wife's stockings and other feminine things. he finds a small roll of bills and takes one of them, putting the bill in his pocket and closing the dresser drawer.}
