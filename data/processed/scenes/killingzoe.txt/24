<L>__{interior eric's flat bedroom night}
<A>__{eric's bed has probably never been made. in fact, this room looks a lot like quentin tarantino's old apartment. but, there is a certain order to all this chaos. eric pulls out a blueprint and spreads it out over the bed.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{don't ask me where we got this.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{on bastille day, all the banks are closed.}
<A>__{he places his hand on the blueprinterior}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{but this one. bip. the banque internationale de paris. and for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain closed next bastille day. yes?}
<A>__{zed smiles.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{we will go in and shut the bank down. now, look at this.}
<A>__{eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{as you can see, only one person can start the alarm.}
<P>__{(he hands it to zed)}
<D>__{the concierge, at this desk.}
<P>__{(he points it out on the blueprint)}
<D>__{we will take care of him. then we can close the bank. no one will know the difference since every other bank will be closed.}
<C>__{zed}
<P>__{(turning the schematic around)}
<D>__{are you sure he won't push the alarm?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{ahhh! he's right next to the door. we'd have to be totally incompetent not to stop him. don't worry about that.}
<A>__{he points to the main floor vault.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{here. this is where they keep the days reserve cash. okay fuck that.}
<A>__{he flips the page to the lower level blueprinterior}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{there are many vaults downstairs, but this is the vault we must get into. this is where the real prize is.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{what kind of vault is that?}
<A>__{he checks the blueprinterior}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{ah...swiss made. a caliber.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{caliber?}
<P>__{(he thinks about it)}
<D>__{it'll take three hours.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{no, that's too long.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{that's how long it'll take.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{well shit. it's too long. we have to be in and out.}
<P>__{(he snaps his fingers)}
<D>__{like that. or there will be suspicion. a little time is okay...but too long and...}
<A>__{he shrugs his shoulders in an "i don't know gesture."}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{well hold on a second.}
<P>__{(pointing to the blueprint)}
<D>__{what's this?}
<A>__{eric looks down at the blueprinterior there is a small passage connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{another vault.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{no this.}
<A>__{eric looks closely at the blueprinterior}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i don't know...it connects the two vaults.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{well, what kind of vault is this other one?}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(reading the blueprint)}
<D>__{also swiss, but this one is a poseidon.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{why would those two vaults be connected?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{because i can get into this vault in half an hour. maybe less.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{but this entry way is too small to get the platen out. we have a lot of merchandise in there.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{no, don't you see? we get in through this secondary vault and take this passage to the other main vault. from the inside i could open the caliber vault in five minutes.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you could open it in five minutes?}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{from the inside it's easy.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{hot damn. that is our answer.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{okay. when is bastille day?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{tomorrow.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{tomorrow!? we're doing this tomorrow?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{but of course.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{it's impossible.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{it's not impossible. everyone knows what to do.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{i don't know what to do.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you don't need to know shit. just get into the vault and we'll do the rest.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{i haven't even seen the bank.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{fuck the bank. before we do a job we live life. it's better that way. okay?}
<C>__{zed}
<P>__{(unsure)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{good. now we do heroin!}
