<L>__{interior violet's bedroom day}
<D>__{the closet is mostly empty now, the bed overflowing with discarded clothes. mattie fae nurses a cocktail, hands a photo to violet.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{look at me.}
<P>__{(shows photo to ivy)}
<D>__{look at me.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{you're beautiful, mom.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i was beautiful. not anymore.}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{oh, now }
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{you're still beautiful.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{one of those lies we tell to give us comfort. women are beautiful when they're young and not after. men can still preserve their sex appeal into old age. not those men like you see with shorts and those little purses around their waists. some men can maintain a weary masculinity. women just get old and fat and wrinkly.}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{think about the last time you went to the mall and saw some sweet little gal and thought she's a cute trick. what makes her that way? taut skin, firm boobs, an ass above her knees.}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{i'm still very sexy, thank you very much.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you're about as sexy as a wet card board box, mattie fae, you and me both. look, wouldn't we be better off if we stopped lying about these things and told the truth? "women aren't sexy when they're old." i can live with that. can you live with that?}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{what about sophia loren? what about lena horne? she stayed sexy till she was eighty. violet finds something else in the closet for ivy to try.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{the world is round. get over it. now try this dress on.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i won't.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you don't know how to attract a man. i do. that's something i always }
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{we just buried my father, i'm not trying to attract !}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i'm not talking about today, dummy, this is something you can wear }
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{i have a man. all right? i have a man.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you said you weren't looking for a man }
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{and i'm not. because i have one. okay? now will you leave it alone?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{no, i won't leave it alone.}
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{no, let's not leave it alone.}
<C>__{ivy }
<D>__{i wish you both could see the brainsick looks on your faces }
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{who is it?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{nobody. forget it }
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{tell us, is he someone from school? how old is he, what's he do ?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{i'm not telling you anything so }
<C>__{mattie fae}
<D>__{you have to tell us something!}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{no, i really don't.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{are you in love, ivy?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{i...i don't...i'm... ivy bursts into awkward laughter, vi and mattie squeal.}
