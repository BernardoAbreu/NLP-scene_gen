<L>__{interior apartment crime scene, hallway morning}
<A>__{a dark hall. somerset and mills stand with officer davis, 28, a beefy, uniformed cop. light from a camera's flash spills in from the nearby kitchen. davis hands somerset two flashlights.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{at what time did you confirm the death?}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{like i said, we didn't touch anything, but we were on scene at like o five hundred, so he's had his face in a plate of spaghetti for about half an hour.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{wait, wait, wait. you didn't check him? you didn't check vital signs?}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{believe me, he's gone. unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce now.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{no. the point is, when you're first man in, you check vital signs.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{this guy's sitting in a pile of his own shit and piss. if he ain't dead he would have stood up by now.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(getting angry)}
<D>__{listen, godzilla...}
<A>__{somerset steps in, heads mills off.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{thank you, officer davis. we'll see you again after we've had a look.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{davis leaves, eyeing mills. mills watches him. somerset hands mills a flashlight, takes out surgical gloves.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{and, i wonder how many times officer davis there has found a supposedly dead man who didn't really die until davis was back in the patrol car calling the morgue and eating a powdered donut.}
<A>__{somerset snaps one glove over his hand and checks the fit.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{drop it. we have more important concerns just now, don't we?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{fine... for now.}
