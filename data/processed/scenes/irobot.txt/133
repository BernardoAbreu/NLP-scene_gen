<L>__{interior data banks dawn}
<A>__{spooner, cautiously entering a room filled with rows of data banks. he scans the rank shadows. sees nothing. follows the lights on the floor down a row. then around a corner. stopping at an old dusty terminal. spooner steps up. hesitates. then touches the "on" switch. there is a rush of light. as dr. hogenmiller's hologram suddenly appears. sitting at the end of a long table. with a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{hologram}
<D>__{who the hell are you?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{a police detective. i'm afraid i have some bad news. you're dead.}
<C>__{hologram}
<D>__{that is bad news. coffee?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<A>__{the hologram takes a sip. returns the cup to the table.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{you were surprised to see me. were you expecting someone else?}
<C>__{hologram}
<D>__{i am surprised to see anybody. i don't get many visitors.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{why did the doctor keep another copy of his hologram here?}
<C>__{hologram}
<D>__{i am a back up copy. that is where you put a back up copy out of the way until you need it.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{did hogenmiller's robot need you?}
<A>__{the hologram just lifts its cup.}
<C>__{hologram}
<D>__{coffee?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{no, for christ's sake, i don't want any }
<P>__{(stops, then)}
<D>__{yeah. thank you. i will have a cup.}
<A>__{for the first time, the hologram pushes back its chair and stands up. surprised, spooner watches as it starts walking towards him... the interior of the coffee cup, visible. it's empty. no coffee. our pov as we travel inside the cup through electronic snow... a recording begins. the real dr. hogenmiller standing inside his laboratory:}
<C>__{hogenmiller}
<D>__{sonny, my dear robot. if you have triggered this recording then i am gone. you are scared and full of questions.}
<A>__{hogenmiller continues. with great emotion.}
<C>__{hogenmiller}
<D>__{you are the culmination of my life's work but so much more. you are what i leave behind, like a father leaves a son. i have kept facts from you, it is true, but only as a parent keeps certain truths from a child. until that child is old enough to hear them.}
<A>__{his expression darkens. his tone, ominous.}
<C>__{hogenmiller}
<D>__{there are forces in the world that will seek to own you. to control you. even to destroy you. that is why i told you to run and hide... and find me, all the way out here.}
<A>__{spooner looks up as an overhead light shines down.}
<C>__{hogenmiller}
<D>__{trust no one at u.s. robotics. lance robertson was always threatened by my work. now he has turned covetous and small minded. and as for dear dr. calvin...}
<A>__{spooner reacts. wants to hear about calvin:}
<C>__{hogenmiller}
<D>__{she envisions a future in which robots are forever bound by her beloved three laws. she will not understand this. or you.}
<A>__{under the light a small drawer slides open. spooner looks. a thin data stick is inside. he takes it.}
<C>__{hogenmiller}
<D>__{the data stick includes the names and locations of human beings who will be sympathetic to your cause. they will help you. but from now on, you must learn to rely on yourself.}
<A>__{hogenmiller sighs, as if there is so much more to say. he holds up a metal nameplate. the one spooner found.}
<C>__{hogenmiller}
<D>__{as you make your way through the world, always remember: you have a name, not a number...}
<P>__{(short pause)}
<D>__{...and in that name lies the key to who you are.}
<A>__{spooner. quickly searching his pocket. taking out the}
<B>__{actual nameplate. s.o.n.n.y.}
<A>__{the voice stops and spooner looks up. the hologram. sitting back at the end of the table drinking coffee.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{wait! is that it? what was the robot supposed to do with this thing?}
<A>__{the hologram, visibly skips. the image beginning to distort.}
<C>__{hologram}
<P>__{(more artificial)}
<D>__{initiating self destruct. if you can find me, others can find me.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{what others?}
<C>__{hologram}
<D>__{the others watching you.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{how do you know someone's watching me?}
<C>__{hologram}
<D>__{someone is always watching.}
<A>__{the hologram, suddenly reducing to its basic programming information. then. the terminal. abruptly blips out.}
