<C>__{green suit}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{yeah. if i wanted to paddle down the river, where's the best place to launch out of?}
<C>__{green suit}
<D>__{"to launch out of?" what's your experience level?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{not much.}
<C>__{green suit}
<D>__{any? do you have a permit?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{a permit for what?}
<C>__{green suit}
<D>__{you can't paddle down the river without a permit. if you like, you can apply for one here, get yourself some experience, and i will put you on the wait list.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{wait list? to paddle down a river?}
<C>__{green suit}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{well, how long do you have to wait?}
<C>__{green suit}
<D>__{i've got an opening may 2003.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{twelve years?}
<C>__{green suit}
<D>__{well, you could always join a commercial raft trip and go with a licensed guide. they usually have a few last minute cancellations. i think it's about two thousand dollars.}
<A>__{chris busts a gut.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{thanks for your help.}
<A>__{the green suit eyes chris' departure with suspicion.}
