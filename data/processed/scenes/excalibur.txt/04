<L>__{interior tintagel castle hall night}
<A>__{drums and wailing flutes fill the banquet hall with a lusty rhythm. armored warriors watch a lone woman dancing. she is very beautiful, both sensuous and innocent. uther sits at the long table beside the duke of cornwall with the barons and dukes of the land, and the lesser knights. the table is stained with wine and littered with bones and half eaten fruit. uther's eyes burn with lust as he watches the dancer.}
<C>__{duke of cornwall}
<D>__{i would wish you such a wife, lord uther, as my igrayne. so innocent, but in bed, a furnace...}
<A>__{the duke rises and goes to his wife, be striding the center of the hall and igrayne weaves circles of dance around him. he gloats with pride. the words escape his lips:}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{i must have her.}
<A>__{lot spins to face him.}
<C>__{lot}
<D>__{what? you're mad! what about the alliance?}
<C>__{uther}
<P>__{(oblivious)}
<D>__{i must have her.}
<C>__{lot}
<D>__{and risk all you've won? this castle commands the sea gate to the kingdom.}
<A>__{uther is not one for politics, and lot's words sail past him. the king lusts for igrayne. a bell is struck not far away. the music ceases and the hall falls silent. the great door creaks open, revealing the dawn light, and a monk steps into the hall and waits by it. muffled by corridors of stone, a choir of monks can now be heard singing the high, ecstatic harmonies of the te deum. those who have fallen asleep at the table are roused, those drunk, helped up.}
