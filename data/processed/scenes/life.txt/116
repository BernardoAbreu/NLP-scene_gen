<L>__{exterior camp 8 yard sundown}
<A>__{ray's been given the same treatment as claude. barefoot, balanced on coke bottles, the two men stand a few feet apart facing each other. a trusty with a rifle keeps an eye on them. after years of silence, the tension reaches the breaking pointerior..}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you're a sucker. i'd have taken that deal.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{excuse me? are you talking to me?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to new york right now.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{after all these years of blissful silence, i almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i hope you don't think i owe you anything. because i don't owe you a damn thing.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i didn't do if for you, anyway. i just ain't no boot licking trusty, that's all.}
<A>__{the trusty tightens his grip on his rifle. he'd love the opportunity.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i was sorry to hear about your mama passing.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that was five years ago.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i know, but since we're talking, i thought i'd mention it.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{we're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.}
<A>__{they stand in stony silence. then ray starts to laugh. a long, low belly laugh.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{bullets weren't the problem. that pie was too hot. burned my tongue.}
<A>__{the two men start to laugh. really laugh. nearly a decade's worth of laughter comes welling up out of them, and they nearly lose their balance, which only makes them laugh harder.}
