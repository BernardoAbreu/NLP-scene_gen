<C>__{ted}
<D>__{ don't call me teddy.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{ted, the night's cake. it's easy. the day's when it's busy. during the night there's nothing to do.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's new year's eve.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{which'll make it less busy than normal. ever worked on christmas? unless you sell turkeys, business is dead. you just got butterflies, that's all.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what i have ain't butterflies. i can't handle this hotel all by myself.}
<A>__{betty slows the scene down.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{okay, let's calm down a minute. slow it down, cool it off. let's just talk.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you can say any goddamn thing you want }

<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay... okay... okay... i'm calm, i'm cool, let's talk.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{ted, in a nutshell, all you have to do is hold the fort. it's new year's eve. most of the guests are going out. you'll just be giving them a little nod as they come staggering in at three... four... five... in the morning. nobody's having any parties, a few get togethers, but no parties. you got about three people checking in tonight, that's it. the only variable is chester rush in the penthouse.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{chester rush? the guy from the wacky detective?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{yeah, him and his entourage checked in last night. they're in the penthouse. the only reason i refer to it as a variable is that he's a movie star. ya never know about movie stars. i'm tellin' ya, ted, it's cake.}
<A>__{betty takes a piece of paper and writes her number down.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and look, if you have any problems, call me at the party.}
<A>__{ted thinks about it for a moment.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{great }
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{ for fifty bucks.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{fifty bucks!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you're shirking your duties for this nazi. for that you pay a price, and the price is fifty bucks.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{one, horst is not a nazi. two, that's not a fair price. you're taking advantage of the situation. twenty bucks. now, twenty bucks is a fair price.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah, but what you're doin' to me ain't fair. and, you are completely and totally taking advantage of me and your position. so fifty bucks is the perfect price.}
<A>__{betty begrudgingly digs in her purse.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{okay, but don't be a pussy. you don't bother me unless it's an emergency. in fact, for fifty bucks, you better not call me unless the fuckin' building's burning down.}
<A>__{she gives him the money.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{get ready to take the desk.}
<A>__{betty leaves. ted sits in the chair, takes another drink, and prepares himself for the night.}

<L>__{exterior the mon signor hotel dusk}
<A>__{ted, the bellboy, meets his first guest of the evening, as a taxi unloads her luggage. to his warm surprise, the guest is a beautiful mediterranean goddess (actually, we will come to see she is not technically a goddess, but a high priestess). she is about 25 years old, speaks with an italian accent and is dressed in gypsy garb. she is athena. ted takes athena's luggage onto his cart. but one item in a woven moroccan bag proves to be unbearably heavy. athena is concerned as he attempts to lift it.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{pleeze be careful my god. you have no idea...}
<A>__{ted strains as he uses all his cojones to lift the insanely heavy bag onto the cart. athena tips the cab driver, stingily. the driver winces and gets in the cab. ted has now managed with grunts and groans and strained blood vessels to put this thing on the cart. the cab skids away. athena looks at ted, who is out of breath.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{i'm usually a good tipper, but this one this cab driver he had green all around him. i don't like that in a man.}
<A>__{ted wheezes and pounds on his chest.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{green? is that bad? like you read auras or something like that?}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{ted}

<C>__{athena}
<D>__{i see purple... in your face, and...}
<A>__{as if she can't help herself, athena's eyes are strangely drawn to his crotch. she frowns, confused by this impulse. ted appears to be charmingly oblivious. athena looks back into his face.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{...you're okay.}
<A>__{ted touches his face as if searching for the "purple" in it and moves the cart inside, discreetly checking out his crotch and giving her a confused side glance.}

<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay... and how will you be paying?}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{with gold.}
<A>__{he looks at this wacky gypsy chick numbly she pulls out her gold card and smiles.}
<L>__{exterior elevator dusk}
<A>__{the doors open and ted and athena emerge upon the third floor. ted follows athena with the cart down the hallway to her room.}
<B>__{at the honeymoon suite door}
<A>__{ted opens the door, then lifts the easiest bags first. in the center of the room is a jacuzzi with hokey plastic cupids poised with urns on each side. a dormant fireplace looms beyond the still hot tub. ted stares at the heavy bag with anxiety then looks in front of him to athena as she rubs the round plastic head of a little cupid and mumbles, "perfect." then, arms open wide, chin lifted to heaven, eyes closed, she mumbles a faint incantation. then she does a belly dance wiggle and turns to ted, who is truly perplexed.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{well the other bag i need it.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{he starts to lift it, again straining and turning purple. he laughs sickly.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what the hell you got in here, lady? nuclear weapons?}
<A>__{she relieves him of the task and effortlessly picks up the bag.}
<C>__{athena}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{the white cliffs of dover.}
<A>__{ted is stunned as she slings the bag over her shoulder and pauses to pull a 10 spot out of her cleavage. she hands it to him. ted is grateful and disoriented.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{the others will be coming soon. send them, pleeze.}
<A>__{ted nods, confused by "the others," and walks off with the cart. then he turns from outside the doorway.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{oh i forgot to show you how to turn on the jacuzzi.}
<A>__{but athena is ahead of him she flips a switch and water begins to flow from the baby cupids' urns into the hot tub.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{i been in dis' place many new year's. so... you send the others to me, huh. go now.}
<A>__{as she says this, the door closes with a strange force, shutting ted out. athena takes the bag to the bedroom of the suite.}
<B>__{in the suite bedroom}
<A>__{a round bed with pink tuck'n'roll headboard. it's impossible to imagine having an orgasm in this room unless it were achieved by laughing. athena carefully removes a large, beautiful white slab of stone from her tapestry bag. she caresses it and carries it like a baby to the bed and places it in the very center, the head of the rock resting on dusty heart shaped pillows. then she removes from her bag a pink negligee and matching high heeled slippers. and these she places with reverence on the bed.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{on this night, oh great goddess diana, we restore your virgin flesh and bring you back to real life.}
<A>__{close on the rock slab. we hold the artifact.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{soon i take you to the pond for a cleansing. well, it's a swimming pool, but it will be under the setting sun, okay?}
<L>__{interior front desk dusk falls}
<A>__{just as ted is recovering from the mystery of this first guest, elspeth arrives. she has skin like marble, the body of venus, piercing blue eyes, blond hair and is dressed all in black clothing, like honey west in a rubber dress. she carries several bags, and a silver sword on her shoulder.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{may i help you?}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{i... we... have a reservation.}

<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{wait up, gawd! i had to get supplies for this boring ass night.}
<C>__{elspeth}

<C>__{ted}
<D>__{oh yeah... you must be one of "the others." and what're you carrying the rock of gibraltar?}
<A>__{she stares at him without humor. he fumbles for the key. he walks around the desk to help her with her black crocodile luggage. jars clang inside. he is ready to go, but elspeth turns to lecture kiva on the hazards of smoking, as kiva lights up.}

<D>__{what'd i tell you about smoking?}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{you smoke.}

<D>__{"hello welcome to this week's edition of the hypocrite of the year award "}

<A>__{she cuts kiva's ramble off. kiva blows smoke defiantly.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{you're not my mother!}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{yes i am.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{then why're we sleeping together?}
<A>__{ted looks on uneasily at the relationship that is beginning to unfold here. elspeth checks his reaction and becomes self conscious at his scrutiny.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{well... i didn't mean it... literally. i... i happen to be the only one who... cares about you }
<A>__{but her wild child looks off, bored. elspeth turns to ted, flustered.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{please take us to our room!}
<A>__{ted smiles uneasily and reaches to relieve her of her sword, but elspeth quickly slams her palm on the sword and shoots him a piercing glare. he jumps back with a light nervous laugh. he leads the way to the elevator.}
<B>__{at the honeymoon suite door}
<A>__{the couch has been set out here in the hall, as well as coffee tables, lamps, and the tv. elspeth and kiva enter the room. athena is gone. as ted stumbles around the furniture in the hall, he peers in the room and see a transformation. with most of the furniture removed, candles and incense and flowers are beginning to form an altar around the fireplace. but oddest of all is the pink tinged water swirling in the jacuzzi and pouring from the cupid urns. a sprinkle of white powder on the carpet encircles the hot tub. elspeth hands him a tip as he gawks at the circle.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{flea powder. one of the others is bringing her cat.}
<A>__{ted starts away again, perplexed. he turns for one last look to see elspeth kneeling before kiva, who sprawls on the floor. he shakes his head and leaves.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{you're gonna have to wait in the other room.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{because i said so.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{i will watch tv.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{you can't watch tv because the noise will interfere with our ritual.}
<A>__{kiva looks around the room and spies the tv in the hallway. she turns to elspeth with sarcastic concession.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{okay... mommy.}
<A>__{elspeth bristles as the brat saunters off to the bedroom. elspeth enters the sacred circle, stands before the altar, whips out her sword, and makes a ceremonial gesture pointing the sword upward, perfectly centered between her breasts. kiva, behind elspeth's back, exits from the bedroom doorway into the hall and comes back in, lugging the tv into the honeymoon bedroom. elspeth kneels before the altar. athena enters the room with the "cleansed" artifact and lays the slab in the center of the altar upon the heart shaped pillows as elspeth lays her sword next to the rock. the women look upon the union with tender affection.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{soon our goddess will come. i will go get her negligee.}
<A>__{athena stands up but her reverie is dispelled as she shrieks! loud tv suddenly blasts from the bedroom and kiva the brat is trying on the pink negligee over her clothes. athena takes the negligee off the irrepressible youth.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{what are you doing! have you no respect who who is dis girl?}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{kiva. my friend. kiva, turn off the tv! i can't leave her at home she's on probation and i gotta keep an eye on her.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{well, elspeth, your friend cannot stay here during the ritual. she may be one of your kind, but she is not one of us.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{she stays!! or i go along with my offering!}
<A>__{the women have a stare down. then athena calls out }
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{turn of the fucking tv, man!}
<C>__{kiva}
<P>__{(in a seductive pout)}
<D>__{make me...}
<A>__{elspeth becomes anxious with jealousy. athena is exasperated as she firmly demands from elspeth }
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{let's not forget i am the high fucking priestess. deal with dis girl!}
<A>__{elspeth defers to athena with remembered reverence and respect. she bows apologetic and scurries to the bedroom.}

<P>__{(eyes lifted to heaven, wearily)}
<D>__{tell me did we have these problems in salem? i don't think so...}
<B>__{in the bedroom}
<A>__{elspeth swallows her rage and approaches the brat with a soft touch.}
<C>__{elspeth}

<A>__{kiva smirks... yeah, she knows.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{your sweet side.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{and what do i get if i'm sweet?}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{you get whatever you want. and you know what else i love about you?}
<C>__{kiva}
<P>__{(seduced now)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{your nose.}
<A>__{and saying this, she kisses kiva's nose and leaves the room. kiva is quieted now. as elspeth closes the bedroom door, she has the last word.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{and i saw you checking her out.}
<A>__{kiva slinks back on the bed, put in her place for now. in the hallway exterior elevator dusk the doors open and ted pushes a cart of expensive designer luggage and lots of it behind yet another gorgeous gal. this one is jezebel, a southern beauty, fawning over her cat, as she carries nothing else, and proceeds down the hall like a southern princess.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<P>__{(talking to her cat in baby talk)}
<D>__{oh you little stinker... oh you sweet little muffin. yes... mama loves the baby.}
<B>__{at the door}
<A>__{jezebel bursts in, chattering.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{well, this is just darlin'! just darlin' hi dee, girls...}
<A>__{ted carries all her bags inside awkwardly. again, the place has become all the more transformed with wild canopies of exotic cloths and fixings. elspeth and athena are hard at work on a strange nature sculpture as jezebel enters. she stands inside the powdered circle and before the hot tub, which now has dark blue water swirling inside. she presents her cat upward toward heaven frees the cat, bares her breasts and sucks in the vibes: "ahhhh." ted settles the bags down, hoping for a peek at her charms, but her back is to him. the kitty rubs on her leg. she picks it up and presses it against her bare breasts, petting it sweetly. she winks and hands him a tip.}

<D>__{toodle loo.}
<A>__{and saying this, she shoos him away. through the glass doors to the bedroom, she sees kiva sprawled on the bed, writing on herself.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{well i see elspeth has herself a new lil' fool what the hell is she doin' here on our night of annual ritual?}
<C>__{athena}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{i have sanctioned her presence, as long as she behaves. come on there is more work to be done to welcome our great diana.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{i want room service!!}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{why do i always attract girls who are looking for a babysitter?}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{well now, honey, maybe juvenile hall ain't the best place to find serious relationship material.}
<A>__{elspeth seethes at her. jezebel acts blithely innocent.}
<B>__{in the hallway}
<A>__{ted is walking from the room with the cart. his face is etched in a mask of perpetual frown as he looks at the tip in his hand at least these lunachicks tip well. waking him out of his deep mood is raven. another female intoxication, she wears a short skirt, all done up in native american, southwestern themes. no shoes. but she carries a small, old handmade broom. she moves down the hall, blissed out. ted makes eye contact, despite himself.}
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{i'm looking for the room for making love.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you might be referring to the honeymoon suite. straight thata way... you can't miss it see all that furniture in the hallway }
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{oh i know the way. i just wanted you to know that i knew where i was going and that you needn't bother yourself with me. the others are here great!}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{oh yeah it's so great it's fantastic.}
<C>__{raven}
<P>__{(in deep empathy)}
<D>__{ohhh... i know it all seems very strange but you're coping with us much better than the bellboys of past new year's.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{past new year's?}
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{oh yes we've been coming here every new year... for a long time. thanks for your patience.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{oh hey no problem wreck the place. bring in cats. ruin the carpet with flea powder, pour paint in the jacuzzi. throw the furniture out the... where're your bags?}
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{i travel very light.}
<A>__{ted looks down at the broom at her side, her bare feets, her thick dark hair. it keeps getting weirder. she wanders off.}
<L>__{interior front desk night}
<A>__{the last of the lovely girls arrives. she is different from the others. she looks like a farm girl, very earth mother, with a tablecloth halter top and skirt, sandals, and a simple scarf over her long dark curls. she carries two bags by herself and holds a small black pot under her arm. she is eva.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(already weary of these girls)}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, honeymoon suite.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{oh... yes... i'm late.}
<A>__{she lowers her eyes, worried.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{all right lemme give ya a hand.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{oh... no, that's all right. i can carry them by myself.}
<A>__{she is so sweet and sincere that he feels like a heel to have been irritated with her. he picks up her bags.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'm a man doin' a job no hero.}
<A>__{eva smiles, beautifully.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{well gosh thank you!}
<B>__{in the elevator}
<A>__{ted holds eva's hippy sacks as she holds her black pot. there is a shy quiet tension here.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{tell me, how long have the others been here?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{about an hour.}
<A>__{eva's heart sinks. they arrive at the door. he carries her bags in.}
<B>__{in the suite}
<A>__{the room is entirely transformed into a beautiful glowing palace with an elaborate altar, both earthly and the other earthly. the other four girls are arranging the altar as eva enters.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{you are very late, eva.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i'm sorry, athena. i was attending a birth and the placenta was late in coming.}
<A>__{ted is slightly queasy. she hands him a tip and smiles, then takes it back.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{oh, wait, lemme give you a little more than that...}
<A>__{ted's no fool, he waits while eva looks through her change purse.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{which birth is more important to you, that of a mortal or that of a goddess?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{all life is precious... but i do apologize for being late, elspeth.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{back home, they jist yank on the umbilical cord, do a karate chop on the mama's belly, and them things come right out.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{they do that here, too, jezebel, in the hospitals, but it causes hemorrhages. i fed the mother a bowl of comfrey tea and it brought the afterbirth down perfectly. the couple are going to use it for fertilizer to plant a lovely tree for their baby.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{oh wow if they were really back to nature, they'd eat it, like other mammals do.}
<A>__{close on ted's face as he gets thoroughly grossed out.}
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{in some native american cultures, they dry the umbilical cord, grind it to a fine powder, and put it in a leather pouch that the baby wears to ward off evil. but burying the placenta is also a very sound ecological practice 'cause of the oxygen it carries.}
<C>__{eva}
<P>__{(cheerfully to the others)}
<D>__{yes because you see when the placenta detaches from the uterine wall...}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(wincing in disgust)}
<D>__{uh, thank you, ladies i will be going now. if you need anything }
<A>__{eva places a nice tip in his palm.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{wait. we do need a few things.}
<A>__{ted sighs as eva enters the circle with her black pot. she kneels softly, holds her hands in piety before the altar, and softly incants as she offers her pot and places it on the altar. the stone and sword and flowers now rest here on pillows covered in chiffon scarves. the negligee hangs from the mantel, the slippers underneath as if expecting someone to materialize into the garments.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{we need fresh rosemary from the kitchen. mostly what we need is from the kitchen. hey, are you listening?}
<A>__{ted is watching eva, enchanted.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, rosemary.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{and a little bit of sea salt or kosher salt if you don't got no sea salt. a bottle of spring water italian please, not french shit.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{and some french fries!}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{kiva, shut up.}
<C>__{athena}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{and some ginger, two of the eyes of a trout fish, and a piece of raw meat, liver if you have it.}
<C>__{kiva}
<P>__{(whining)}
<D>__{i want fries you dumb jerks with your stupid fucking ritual!}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{shut up, you little shit.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{don't talk to her that way!}
<A>__{ted has scribbled down the items as she speaks. he looks at this list and these girls and shudders as he walks away. he turns, points at eva. ted smiles at this angel of a girl. she smiles back. but, as she looks him in the eyes, he feels a strange buzzing connection happening. he holds his head, almost swooning with dizziness. athena smirks.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{get to work, man.}
<A>__{ted comes out of his daze, looks at the list again and huffs off. after he goes, the girls begin to bring forth their most treasured offerings in ornate ancient bottles, vases or vials. jezebel folds her arms and clears her throat in the direction of kiva, sitting idly on the edge of the blue water jacuzzi, with her feet dipping irreverently in the water.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{kiva...}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{you have to go in the next room now.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{oh, wow, like i'm bummed out that i can't watch.}
<P>__{(whining at elspeth)}
<D>__{i'm bored!}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{up!}
<A>__{she climbs up the stairs, trying to pull the brat to her feet.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{don't put me in there by myself. i will miss you way too much.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{kiva, don't do this to me.}
<A>__{kiva sees a bit of weakening here; she takes her feet out of the jacuzzi. she begins to speak softly.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{please... if you just lemme... i will play dress up with you, the way you like it... you know what i mean... remember...?}
<A>__{elspeth begins to weaken. but continues to pull the brat up. kiva pours on softer seduction.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{we can pretend and i will do it exactly... the way you want it... with the egg whites and the kilt.}
<A>__{elspeth is now fully seduced. kiva takes elspeth's hand and presses it lightly on her face.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{you mean... like last week?}
<A>__{kiva nods. elspeth is enthralled, but from a disgusted "ick" sound from jezebel, elspeth realizes she's revealing this side of her life in front of her coven. she nervously looks around and see all the coven looking at her: a disgusted jezebel, an understanding raven, a preoccupied eva and an impatient and stern athena. elspeth comes to her senses, straightens her posture.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{we'll talk about this later, kiva.}
<C>__{kiva}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she turns on elspeth and bites her hand. elspeth pulls her arm away and grabs kiva by the hair.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{aw, really now child abuse?}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{you stay outta this!}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{i demand this stop now, elspeth!}
<A>__{elspeth lets go of kiva's hair. kiva jerks away from her.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{i'm running away from you!}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{fine. go ahead. and i will call your parole officer and she'll find you and send you back to eastlake!}
<A>__{kiva stomps off into the bedroom.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{now that the fucking melodrama is over, can we start the goddamn ritual pleeze?}
<A>__{elspeth enters the powered circle. each girl takes off her shoes. they anoint themselves with oils.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{we are communing here on new year's eve to bring to life the great goddess diana, who was turned to stone in this very room forty years ago today.}
<A>__{the girls moan in sleepy, eerie agreement as they begin to sway within the circle.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{diana, great beautiful one, we make these offerings to you, that we may undo the wicked spell which deprived you of the seed of your lover, your virginal blood, of your very life. we now form the symbolic rock with our bodies.}
<A>__{and saying this, the girls all form a "rock" with their bodies gracefully draped one upon the other. music begins, and slowly they start to unfold from the rock. the girls each find their place in a semicircle around the jacuzzi. some bare their breasts, other strip off a layer of clothes. they anoint their arms with water from the jacuzzi. they begin a lovely dance, snaking their way around the semicircle. the first one to go from one end to the other is athena. she then proceeds up the stairs and positions herself between the altar and the jacuzzi. she steps forth with a bottle to the altar and pours it into the jacuzzi.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{on this night, in this hour, we call upon the ancient power o goddess bride, i offer thee milk from a mother's sweet titty!}
<A>__{each of the girls moans eerily. athena places the bottle on the altar and bows away. she joins the circle as elspeth now steps forward with her offering in a vial.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{to reverse the evil which has been done i make this offering to the divine one a whore not, an innocent was, for whom i seized a virgin's blood.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{goddess of light, goddess of lust, to undo this awful spell is a real must. to bring you life and get you high i offer the sweat of five men's thighs.}
<A>__{the girls moan loudly as they sway. jezebel places her offering in the hot tub and bows out, returning to the circle. now raven comes forth with a small leather canteen. she unscrews the lid as she offers in her opiate stupor.}
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{diana, oh great one, we live without sun until this wicked curse is undone. in hope that you live, and to us appear, i have collected a year's worth of tears.}
<A>__{she pours liquid into the mix, as the witches moan. now it's eva's turn. eva continues to sway, not moving forth to the altar. the girls keep their eyes closed as they sway, waiting for eva's offering. athena finally gives her a push and she goes. eva kneels before the altar. she produces a silver bottle with a chain on its cap and neck. she timidly begins to incant.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{great goddess diana, fail you i will, i was to bring fresh sperm from my bill. i had him erect, and his semen would follow but alas i was hot, so hot that i swallowed.}
<A>__{the moans turn to wails as the girls gasp and shriek! athena opens her eyes, wildly.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{you stupid little witch! you swallowed the sperm! aye yi yi!}
<A>__{elspeth opens her eyes and folds her arms, smirking bitterly.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{it just shows what an amazing lack of control you have over yourself, eva!}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{honey, why didn't you just use your hands? didn't your mama teach you not to put them things in your mouth?}
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{i understand though...}
<A>__{eva bursts into tears. athena is firm.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{there is no time to cry over swallowed sperms. you're gonna have to get some, baby. you have one hour to prove what kind of witch you really are.}
<A>__{just then: a knock at the door.}
<C>__{athena}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{what do you want?!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{ted... the bellboy.}
<A>__{athena smiles and turns to eva.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{mr. bellboy, come right in!}
<A>__{ted opens the door. his eyes bulge out as he looks upon the fleshly feast. he steps back. they giggle seductively, all except eva, who sniffles, red eyed. amazingly, ted's attention is captivated by eva's sorrow, not by the naked charms of the other witches. she shyly covers her breasts. sensitive to her shame and sorrow, he looks away and steps from the door to fetch the room service cart. athena directs the others to put on their shirts. ted wheels in the cart.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{here's the things you asked for. oh, and uhh, sorry, but i'm not gonna pick the eyes outta this dead fish.}
<A>__{he points to the trout. elspeth picks it up, flings the eyes into the jacuzzi, and tosses the trout out of the window. she smirks at him comtemptuously.}
<C>__{athena}
<P>__{(handing ted 50 bucks)}
<D>__{okay, mister, here's your fifty dollar tip, only, you have to do one more thing... make our little eva smile. can you? we'll leave you alone.}
<P>__{(to eva, firmly)}
<D>__{and don't use your mouth!}
<A>__{the girls step out. athena turns to eva and points to her watch, then holds up one finger. eva looks up, worried. the door closes on her and ted. she looks at ted and sighs. he covers her with a shawl.}
<B>__{in the hallway}
<A>__{the other witches listen at the door.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{if she doesn't get his goop in ten minutes, i'm going to take him myself.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{ha! that'll be a first for you.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{oh shit kiva!}
<A>__{she runs back in for her bratty girlfriend, who is already sneaking out the bedroom door.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{and just where do you think you're going?}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{well, gawd i need a candy bar or something you haven't fed me all day. i'm getting all shaky. my blood sugar's really low.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{elspeth honestly now some babysitter you're turnin' out ta be!}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{enough, girls. i will collect fresh earth. jezebel, i want you to gather damp moss. raven, you bring me a birch branch.}
<A>__{elspeth, you go feed your terrible girlfriend. we meet back here in one hour and let's all have faith that eva can get this guy off. the witches disperse.}
<L>__{interior honeymoon suite night}
<A>__{eva sits among pillows before the altar as ted stands in front of her. ted is trying his best to make poor eva smile. but no matter what his antics, she looks off sadly.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{help me out, lady. i gotta earn this fifty bucks!}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{oh look, they don't care if i smile or not! all they want is...}
<A>__{ted waits; she sighs and rest her chin in her hand.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{you won't understand, believe me.}
<A>__{she begins to cry tearfully again.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{try me. i've been around, y'know.}
<A>__{he postures proudly, all puffed out. eva looks at him helplessly. and he paternally encourages her to explain.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{well... okay. the five of us elspeth, jezebel, athena, raven and me are a coven.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{ha, like a coven of witches?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{he looks around the room: quick cuts of candles, iconography, jars of lurid substances, unknown body parts of animals woven into the nature sculpture... and are those tongues in that can? ted's getting the creeps, but again puffs himself up.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i knew that!}
<C>__{eva}
<P>__{(getting calmer)}
<D>__{and you see, our coven has spent forty years trying to perfect a ritual to undo a wicked curse put on our goddess diana.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{gee, you don't look a day over twenty!}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{oh... ha ha... i mean the witches before us tried and failed. but athena, our high priestess, discovered a great potion to reverse the evil spell which turned our beautiful goddess into an old rock.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(looking at the rock)}
<D>__{yeah? is... is that her?}
<A>__{eva nods, looking lovingly at the stone.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{she was a beautiful virgin. an entertainer by trade, but a great sorceress by design. it was here in this very room, on her wedding night, a jealous rival placed the curse on diana.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{she turned to that here?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{yes... and her young husband turned into a pink fish! they found him swimming in the pool in circles. while our dear goddess: a stone in her honeymoon bed.}
<A>__{ted frowns as he ponders all this. eva takes a photo from the altar and hands it to ted.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{this was diana.}
<A>__{close on photo: a blond bombshell in full on betty page attire, a bare tittied pinup girl, playfully spanking a girl in bondage with a spiked high heel.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{this girl here? this is the goddess diana?}
<A>__{the photograph slowly comes alive. diana stops spanking the girl and unties her. she pulls the girl (in the black satin mask) up off her lap and makes the girl stand. the women face each other and break into a cheek to cheek tango. close on ted as he shakes his head. are his eyes playing tricks on him?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i hate to tell you this, but i kinda doubt she was a virgin.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{oh, but she was! she had lovers, but she saved that for marriage. which is the example i've tried to follow: to do everything but that till i marry...}
<A>__{she begins to sob again. ted comforts her.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{hey, don't cry... a virgin is a rare and beautiful thing. if you say she was a virgin, i will believe it.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{well, it doesn't matter now... and she won't be resurrected tonight 'cause i failed her. i let my whole coven down!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{wait a sec that rock was gonna turn back into this?}
<A>__{he holds up the photo. eva nods.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{now, that would be something worth seeing!}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{only, not now we were each supposed to bring something a life fluid.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(wincing in disgust)}
<D>__{if this is gonna be like one of those afterbirth conversations, i don't think i wanna hear this.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{only... i swallowed it...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you swallowed what?}
<A>__{eva looks off. ted searches his brains, thoroughly sickened now.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you mean, you were supposed to bring... like... like a guy's... and you...?}
<A>__{she nods; he winces, queasy. eva looks at him, helpless.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{and now, you're my last chance!}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{yeah, sure.}
<P>__{(then panic)}
<D>__{whoa, what? you want my for the witchy poo ahh no no way nope. besides, it's against hotel policy. i was warned: "no sex with the clientele"!}
<A>__{eva sobs, pleading. she throws off her shawl, baring her lovely breasts, and reaches her arms around his neck. he keeps backing off. unbeknownst to him, he is already doing a ritualistic shuffle.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{ha, c'mon now, joke's over.}
<P>__{(seeing this is no joke)}
<D>__{hey, we're gonna step in the flea powder.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{that's not flea powder, that's sacred dust ground from the horns of albino goats.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{right! i knew that!}
<A>__{he is backing away, into the circle, as she comes for him, soft and sweet. her eyes are again putting the magic hex on him, as he tries to resist her gaze.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what's a nice girl like you doing in a coven, anyway?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{well, see, what i really want to do is be a midwife. i've attended four births already! i can prevent vaginal tears and everything.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(trying to dodge her hexing eyes)}
<D>__{well, that's a good thing! a guy doesn't like surprises down there.}
<A>__{all the while she is stepping toward him into the circle.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i joined the coven to attain greater understanding of my feminine power so i could become a truly great midwife!}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(the hex working now)}
<D>__{oh, well, i see you've been gaining a lot of insight into your... girl powers...}
<A>__{eva sweetly takes his hand and places it on her breast.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{do you really think so?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(buckling under the temptation)}
<D>__{well, yeah, i'd say that seems to be the case...}
<P>__{(she licks his neck;}
<D>__{his eyes roll back}
<P>__{heavenly)}
<D>__{ohhh, god! betty's gonna kill me!}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{who's betty your girlfriend?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no. my boss.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{oh good!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{oh no!}
<A>__{they fall into a kiss, as she begins to remove his cap. she moves him toward the jacuzzi, closer and closer.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{ted pushes his room service cart. he is flushed. puffed up. lights a cigarette, takes a great big, satisfied drag. eva runs to the door dreamily, her naked body wrapped in her shawl. she passes him a card.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{my phone number in topanga. call me?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(cocky)}
<D>__{sure, baby. yeah, i will give ya a call.}
<A>__{she smiles and shuts the door. the other witches are arriving with supplies from the garden. kiva, now having raised her blood sugar, sucks on a lollipop, a sunny girl. she talks to raven, who carries a birch limb.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{what's that used for?}
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{it's a birch branch, symbolizing eternal life. you can also use the bark for a tea which assists in astral travel.}
<C>__{kiva}
<D>__{hey i wanna be a witch!}
<A>__{the other girls roll their eyes as elspeth smiles proudly. ted blows smoke at them and pushes his cart off down the hall. the witches run inside the room.}
<B>__{in the suite}
<A>__{eva sits, blissed out, in the center of the circle, smiles.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i'm a woman now!}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{but where is his "stuff"?}
<C>__{eva}
<P>__{(pointing to the jacuzzi)}
<D>__{we did it right there, in the big cauldron!}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{ooohhh honey, you're gonna be sore tomorra! didn't your mama teach you that water strips a girl's lubrication?}
<C>__{raven}
<D>__{sex in water is great in the movies, not in real life... but you will learn. as we all did.}
<C>__{jezebel}
<D>__{yeah, when she can't walk...}
<P>__{(to elspeth)}
<D>__{i guess you wouldn't have those kinds of problems without penetration.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{no. and virtually no cervical cancer, either.}

<A>__{ted saunters down a hallway with a butt hanging out the corner of his mouth and a bucket of ice swinging at his side. he pulls up at a door on which the faded numbers read something like "room 404." ted knocks on the door. after a moment, the latch is thrown and the door swings open. ted cautiously steps into the dark room.}

<A>__{in a flash the lights switch on and ted finds himself staring down the barrel of a pretty intense looking .357 magnum, cocked and ready to fire. at the other end of the gun stands a 50 year old man, sigfried, who sports a cheshire cat smile and a "just try fuckin' with me" look on his face. sigfried isn't the only person in the room. directly behind him sits a beautiful young woman, angela, gagged and bound to a chair. ted drops the bucket to the floor.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i brought your ice.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{that's cute. in fact, the whole getup's kind of cute. the monkey suit's a nice touch, honey puss.}

<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{theodore? what do you take me for, theodore?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{a very upset man?}
<A>__{sigfried reaches in his pocket and throws a handful of assorted stimulants into his mouth, chewing on them like they were breath mints. sigfried thrusts his hand forward, gripping ted by the throat, and leads him to angela.}

<D>__{i am an upset man, theodore.}

<D>__{i'm psychic, theodore.}

<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{let's not belabor the fact that you have no sense of timing, theodore. the fact is you're here.}
<A>__{sigfried turns to angela.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and i couldn't think of a better time for you to introduce me to your beau than on new year's eve.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{oh fuck, there's a mistake. you're fucking wrong here. my name is theodore, yes! my mother named me that and i hate the name. but i'm a fucking bellhop. people call me ted. i work here.}
<A>__{suddenly, with great force, sigfried slams the butt of his pistol smack into ted's temple, sending him to the floor. ted looks up at sigfried in shock.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{look, i'd love to sit here all night with you talking about things like when you broke in your first mitt }
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{that was insensitive of me, wasn't it, t h e o d o r e? but let's cut to the chase, okay?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{so apologize!}
<A>__{a tense silence fills the room. all eyes are on ted, who can't figure out what the fuck this guy wants.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{for what?}
<A>__{sigfried looks hard with disbelief at ted, who winces back.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{you are really beginning to annoy me, theodore.}
<A>__{sigfried throws another handful of pills into his mouth.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, obviously you two are working something out and if i could help you with your problem i would.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{what are you saying? are you saying i got a problem? are you trying to say i don't give her what she needs? that i'm fucking insensitive!!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, is this about another man? or something?}
<A>__{ted has struck a raw nerve. sigfried's mood swings drastically; he bends down next to ted.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{let's get our abc's right, here, theodore. theodore, right?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{ted's better.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{ted, okay... are you saying my wife cheats on me?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i didn't say that... i...}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{oh, for christ's sake, theodore, this is about as intimate a situation as you can get, you, me, and angela here. it's pretty cozy. to say nothing of how stupid an idea it is to lie to a man with a loaded gun without considering the possible response. i demand an apology!}
<A>__{the phone rings.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{don't move. i've got to take this.}
<A>__{sigfried glances at it. then to angela. he picks up the phone.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we ain't got any needles here, kid. just a big fucking gun.}
<A>__{he listens to the other line, says good bye, and hangs up.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{now, where was i? oh yeah, i remember.}
<A>__{sigfried kneels next to ted and assumes a prayer position.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{i want you to pray for forgiveness, theodore.}
<A>__{sigfried, hands clasped together, signals for ted to do the same. the gun lies at his side. ted considers a bold move, but thinks better of it. sigfried's eyes pop open. he cuts a look to ted, signaling him to assume the pose.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now say after me, "i apologize..."}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i apologize...}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{for what?}
<A>__{ted looks to angela for help. she can only stare back with intense, wide open eyes.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{for fucking what?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that i said you might have been unfaithful?}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{"that i said you might have been unfaithful?" listen, theodore, you're in church here... you're kneeling in front of an altar. truth... truth is all it hears. say the following, "i, theodore, must humbly and sincerely apologize for saying that you fucked another man!"}
<A>__{ted repeats what sigfried has told him. this appears to have a calming effect on sigfried, who gets up off the floor, turning his face to angela.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{satisfied?}
<A>__{angela nods.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{do you accept the fucking apology?}
<A>__{naturally, angela says nothing.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you always gotta get the last word, don't you? it's one way with you, angela, isn't it? i give and i give and i get nothing back.}
<A>__{sigfried turns to ted.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{she just sits there waiting for me to jump through hoops...}
<A>__{angela attempts to speak through the gag. both men wait with bated breath for a response. sigfried's had enough.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{stupid me, for a second i thought you were going to say something... something like, "i'm sorry." ha! "i'm sorry." you're absolutely right, love cakes, i wouldn't want it that way. that's one thing you can say about angela. she'll never do anything she doesn't want to do. if the feeling ain't there, she just isn't going to do it. there is nothing in this world as fucked as a woman who gives when she doesn't want to. never let that happen to you, theodore. it makes you feel very little indeed.}
<A>__{ted beckons sigfried.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you mind if i...?}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{go ahead. spit it out.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i don't mean to upset you further, sir, but i think she was trying to say yes.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{are you condescending to me, theodore?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{absolutely not, i would never do that.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{why don't you just say it?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{say what?}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{that you think i'm an idiot.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i would never say that.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{you think you're superior to me, don't ya, theodore? you don't think i notice there is a gag in the woman's mouth.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{of course you do.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{naturally "of course." and do you know how i know that?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{how, sir?}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{because i put the gag in her mouth! i'm gonna let you in on a little secret about communication, theodore. it's all in the eyes...}
<P>__{(points the gun at ted)}
<D>__{him?}
<P>__{(turns the gun on himself)}
<D>__{or me? him or me? no one? okay. let's drag it out.}
<A>__{sigfried empties the last of the pills into his mouth, heaving the empty bottle over his shoulder. he takes off, disappearing into the bathroom.}
<L>__{interior room}
<A>__{ted finds himself alone with angela. they lock eyes. angela implores ted to lean forward. ted sizes up the situation: his chances of making it to the door are slim due to the fact that he would have to pass by the bathroom door. ted paces back and forth in front of angela, who struggles to get his attention. he whips around and they face off in what appears to be a game of charades. ted finally gets the point and cautiously removes the gag from angela's mouth. angela spits an old sock out.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what!}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{we don't have time to play charades here, asshole! untie me quick.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{listen, lady, i don't know what in the hell is going on here, but i'd appreciate it if you would explain to that nutcase that he's making a big mistake.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{look, whether you like it or not, you're in the middle of a situation here you can't just wish your way out of.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{but i've never seen you people before, we're complete strangers.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{everyone starts out strangers, ted, it's where we end up that counts. hurry up.}
<A>__{ted wrestles with the idea of whether to untie angela or not.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i don't know if i can do this. it's too hard.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{life is hard, ted. you ever stopped to consider how many times you change your underwear in a lifetime?}
<A>__{on nervous impulse, ted begins the calculations.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i don't mean literally, you ignoramus.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{forget it, listen to me. there's a gun in my suitcase behind the bed, it's loaded...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'm not going to shoot anybody.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{fine. get the gun and i will shoot "anybody."}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{and make me an accessory in the murder of your husband?}
<A>__{ted collapses to his knees in front of angela.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that's not fair. it just isn't fair.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{get a fucking grip on yourself. first off, who says he's my husband? and second, we are a long way from fair here, fair is back in jolly old england eatin' crumpets and sipping on tea.}
<A>__{ted collects himself.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{tut. tut. tut. not so fast. well, maybe there are two sides to this thing.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{there are two sides to a plate, still you only eat off of one. now get the gun!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{so why's he got you tied up?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i'm a werewolf, ted! get the gun!}
<A>__{ted is at a loss as to what to do. angela turns on the charm.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{come on, ted. come over here just for a minute. you can do it. come on, ted. you look like a good guy.}
<A>__{ted creeps towards her.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{that's it, teddy. you look so much more attractive when you're self assured.}
<A>__{sigfried suddenly comes to life... he's heard from the bathroom belting out "life is but a dream... she boom, she boom."}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(she panics)}
<D>__{quick, he's coming back. put the gag back in, and remember the gun!}
<A>__{ted hurries to replace the sock in her mouth.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{nine thousand, three hundred and twenty two times, to the best of my estimation.}
<L>__{interior room}
<A>__{sigfried coughs, sending a chill up ted's spine. ted whips around to discover sigfried leaning up against the door to the bathroom.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{i was just beginning to think i could trust you, theodore. silly me.}
<A>__{ted's fingers are frozen over angela's lips.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i was just trying to help her breathe a little.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{don't let me stop you, teddy. you don't mind me calling you teddy, do you?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that's fine.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{i used to have a little bunny rabbit named teddy, it looked real cute nibbling on angela's ear. only problem here is you're no bunny rabbit, theodore, and it really fuckin' razzes me to picture you doin' it. but don't let me stop you, teddy... no need to play sneaky poo.}
<A>__{ted starts to back toward the door.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, man, if this is some kind of voodoo thing and you want me to have sex with your wife, there is absolutely no way.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(shouts at the top of his lungs)}
<D>__{i said, nibble, asshole! now!}
<A>__{the directness of sigfried's command, coupled with the sound of a trigger being cocked, forces ted to approach angela. angela is a stunning beauty, and ted being kind of a shy guy makes for an awkward situation. ted leans forward. as he closes in, angela's eyes close.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{sorry, lady.}
<A>__{ted pulls up short of actually nibbling on angela.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{what's the matter, no whiz left in the cheese? i'm not cramping your style, am i?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, i'm not playing this game anymore.}
<A>__{sigfried yanks ted backwards. he wraps his arms around him.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{it's almost all over, theodore, and soon you can go home to mommy.}
<A>__{ted struggles to free himself from sigfried's powerful bear hug and blasts out the following monologue.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{my name is not theodore, it's ted, ted, ted, t... e... d... ted... not teddy, not theodore... ted... yes, my mother did me the service of naming me theodore and i haven't a clue as to how you know that because everyone who knows that lives a long way away from here. do you have any idea what it's like to go to school where all the other kids' parents are in jail doing time for crimes like grand larceny, aggravated assault, burglary and murder, and you get stuck with a mother who names you theodore and dressed you up in little matching pink outfits with, get this, a little blue bow fucking tie! well, i will tell you what happens. pretty soon theodore becomes "theo the thumper," and when theo the thumper gets old enough, he packs his bags and goes thousands of miles away where he can put the whole bloody mess behind him. so, if you don't mind, shoot me now, because no one is going to call me that again. my name is ted, okay? got it? ted!}
<A>__{sigfried has followed the entire tirade in stunned silence. he takes a step toward ted and offers him his hand.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{sigfried.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{my name is sigfried.}
<C>__{ted}

<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{yah, sigfried.}

<D>__{nice to meet you, sigfried.}
<A>__{ted cautiously takes sigfried's hand.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{very impressive, ted. "theo the thumper?"... ouch. it's a deal, kid. ted it will be.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{sigfried holds onto ted's hand. the soft sound of distant fireworks pops in the background. car horns and a muffled countdown signal that it's new year's. sigfried moves uncomfortably close to ted and from out of nowhere bolts forward, planting a wet kiss right on ted's mouth. something snaps in sigfried. he is either really getting off on this or he is caught in the grips of a seizure. he doubles back on the floors. ted and angela watch as he flops around like a flounder with the cocked gun waving all over the place. ted wipes his mouth with his jacket sleeve while trying to dodge the barrel of the gun.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you okay, mister? i will get help!}
<A>__{sigfried manages to steady the gun and point it directly at ted. he signals for ted to go to the bathroom.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{that's the wrong door, sir.}
<A>__{sigfried grabs ted by the leg and shove the barrel of the gun into his crotch. sigfried pulls ted's face closer to his.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{get me the nitro... it's in the bathroom cabinet. now!}
<A>__{ted rushes into the bathroom, leaving sigfried a babbling mess behind.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior bathroom same time}
<A>__{ted enters the bathroom, which appears shaken by an earthquake. towels and wet clothes are all over the place. an evening gown is flushed halfway down the toilet and pills are everywhere. sigfried is shouting from the other room to hurry. ted checks the cabinet, searching for a bottle marked "nitro." no luck. ted spots a small window set above the toilet. he figures this is the best chance he's got to make a break. ted goes for it. he manages to get his head and one arm through the window before he gets stuck. his legs dangle in the bathroom. struggle as he may, he can only hit the toilet bowl lever, which sends a loud flush sound out through the apartment.}
<C>__{sigfried }
<P>__{(shouting in the distance)}
<D>__{it's no time to take a leak, teddy, i'm fucking dying here!}
<L>__{exterior bathroom window night}
<A>__{outside the window, ted's in another world. he's almost safe. it's a strange feeling, kind of like bathing in warm water in paradise, knowing a huge shark is ready to rip his ass off. he can see the flickering red glowing light from the witches' room from the floor below.}
<L>__{exterior bathroom window and below night}
<A>__{ted sees eva bopping naked past the window. he shouts her name out, to no avail. the music drowns out his voice and they ignore his calls for help. the blood rushes to his head. he lets himself hang there for a moment. he wonders how many other people have found themselves in situations like this before him. probably everyone. right next to his face, ted recognizes a bloody hand printerior it's not his blood.}
<L>__{exterior bathroom window and above night}
<A>__{ted hears a sound from above and twists himself around, spotting a young man (previously seen as the yuppie scumbag on the phone) leaning out of the window directly above him. after a quick moment of sizing him up, ted gathers himself.}

<D>__{listen, i'm stuck here in a situation that i can't even begin to explain, but would you be so kind as to get help? could you call the police, please?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{the young man manages to belt out the word "ice" just before hurling a mouthful of vomit toward ted. it takes all ted's strength to dodge the puke and pull himself back into the bathroom. he falls back on the floor. he props himself up and checks for damage. he notices something odd... the room is silent. no sigfried. he walks into the bedroom.}

<C>__{ted}
<D>__{sigfried?}
<A>__{he heads toward the door and, from out of the corner of his eye, he spots sigfried's hairy leg. sigfried has passed out on the floor. angela's chair has been knocked on its side. ted races over to help lift her back up. he pulls the gag from her mouth. angela jumps all over him.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{where's the fucking nitro?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i couldn't find it!}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you took long enough. untie me, for christ's sake, you fucking upset him and he's dying.}
<A>__{ted struggles to untie angela.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i thought you wanted to kill him.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you'd make a great cop, theodore.}
<A>__{the knots are all over the place and a real bitch to untie.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i can't handle this alone, i'd better get help.}
<A>__{ted turns on a dime and runs smack into sigfried, who's been taking in the whole conversation.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{i tie a pretty good knot, don't i, ted?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{thank god you're okay...}

<D>__{you bastard!}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(to angela)}
<D>__{come on, honey, don't get mad. it was just a little test, and i'm glad i did it because now i will know forever that you really do love me. truly and deeply.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{if the simple fact that i didn't want your bloated, dead body lying out on the floor is love, then no wonder we find ourselves as we are at this very fucking moment.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{oh, no. i heard you and there was genuine care in that voice. can't be denied. can it, ted?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i think you're right and, if you just keep this kind of open dialogue going, you'll go a long way to resolving this misunderstanding.}
<A>__{ted edges his way toward the door.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you'd be surprised what happens when people just listen to each other without succumbing to all that pain and anger.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you heard shit, monkey boy. easy for you to say after you fuck another man's wife. you should at least have the guts to stand by your convictions.}

<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that's a lie, sigfried. i swear to god.}

<C>__{angela}
<D>__{when i think of all the times you were inside me promising me a better life, it makes me want to puke.}

<D>__{why are you doing this? what have i ever done to you people?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{what didn't you do, stick man? unfortunately, you don't have the balls to back up the actions of your huge cock.}

<C>__{angela}
<D>__{show him your cock, theodore.}
<A>__{sigfried runs over to angela and kneels in front of her.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{stop talking about his cock, will you?!}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{it's hard to stop talking about something so huge. i could go on and on about his cock, bone, nob, bishop, wang, thang, hotrod. hump mobile, oscar, dong, dagger, banana, cucumber, salami. sausage, kielbasa, schlong, dink, tool, big ben, mister happy, prick, disk, pecker, peter, pee pee, wee wee, weiner, pisser, pistol, joint, hose, horn, middle leg, third leg, meat, stick, joystick, dipstick.}

<A>__{sigfried tries jamming the sock back in her mouth to stop the flow; she manages to give him a "fuck of a bite" in the process. meanwhile, ted figures this to be his moment to make a move and bolts for the door, only to be tackled by sigfried at the one yard line. after a struggle, the two men rest on the floor, catching their breath in a relaxed embrace.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{please, don't leave me. i will call you ted from now on.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's not me, mister, i swear.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{personally, i don't give a fuck, ted, it's just i don't want to be alone right now. i'm feeling a little vulnerable.}
<A>__{sigfried heaves the gun over his shoulder, grabs a half empty bottle of jack daniel's, and passes it to ted, who takes a hit.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{no guns, okay? just you and me, ted. you know my father used to say that forgiveness is the only thing that evil can't sink its teeth into.}

<D>__{that's beautiful.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{kind of nice down here on the floor, isn't it, ted?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yes, actually.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{things take on a whole new perspective... you'd like my trust, wouldn't you, ted?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yes i would.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{i just got one thing to ask you and i will let you go.}
<C>__{ted}

<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sigfried}

<D>__{oh, for fuck sake, sigfried, what do you want me to say?}
<C>__{sigfried}

<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{promise?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i promise.}
<A>__{sigfried releases ted and stands up.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{you're lying, but i can respect that, ted. if you told me, it would no longer be a secret, and secrets have a power, kid. you open that box and they disappear forever. a bad secret will rip you apart, but the good one are all you got. in the end, when all the people you knew are dead and gone, all you'll have left are you secrets. and when you die, the box is open and it all blows away dust to dust all the anger, jealousy, desire and love just blow away.}
<A>__{sigfried throws his hand out to help ted up.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{so you know what i say, let's call it a truce, kiddo.}
<A>__{sigfried takes ted by the hand and leads him to an open window. ted is overcome by the sweetness in sigfried's voice and follows him to the window willingly. the two men look out into the dark los angeles night.}
<C>__{sigfried}

<D>__{i'm a man of love, theodore. love is all i live for.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i can see that.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{maybe to a fault.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{don't beat yourself up over it.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{that's nice of you to say, ted, but i probably should make a clean break of it, cut her loose and get my own place. i just can't imagine living without her. do you think i should seek professional help?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's not for everyone, but maybe in your case it could help.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{you ever been out on the ocean at night?}
<A>__{ted shakes his head.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i have... scary as a motherfucker, all that darkness around you. it's like a big black carpet rolled out as far as the eye can see. sometimes, if you're lucky, you'll see a light. it could be as small as a little spark, but it will cut a path straight through all that blackness, straight to you. it could be another boat, or some distant fire on an island, but that light will shed a shining path of diamonds cutting through mile after mile of darkness to lie at your feet. that's love, ted, it's like a path of light in an ocean of darkness.}
<A>__{ted and sigfried stare out of the window in peace, transfixed by the glimmering lights of the city. a loud shot rings out, shattering the still moment. the two men spin around. angela stands there with a smoking gun hanging at her side. sigfried drops to his knees. ted checks him out, no blood. angela has fired the gun into the floor below. ted looks up at angela. angela opens the chamber of the pistol and hands the bullets to ted.}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{you'd better go check to see if i killed anybody downstairs.}

<D>__{what's the problem? i don't got a problem, i got fuckin' problems! wanna hear?}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(yawning, wiping sleep from her eyes)}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well, most recently, there's room 716. there's a scary mexican gangster dude pokin' his finger in my chest. there's his hooligan kids snapping their fingers at me. there's the putrid rotting corpse of a dead whore stuffed in the springs of a bed. there're rooms blazing afire... there's a needle from god knows where stuck in my leg, infecting me with god knows what, and finally, there's me walking out the fuckin' door right now! buenas noches.}
<A>__{a ringing sound happens that we haven't heard before. ted's head turns toward it. it's the guest board. and the top light, the penthouse, is ringing. it rings where all the others buzzed. betty can hear it distinctly on her side of the line. the sound fully wakes her up. they start talking howard hawks style again.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(suddenly alert)}
<D>__{is that the penthouse?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{that's the chester rush party, they want something.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah, well, tough titty. they're just gonna have to wait, 'cause i'm out the door.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(panicking)}
<D>__{now, ted, wait a minute. i know you're freaked, i know you're stressed. you've had a real bad night }
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yes, betty, i've had a real bad night }
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{ you say there's a dead body in a room?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yes, i did.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{no problem, this is a hotel, we've had dead bodies before, it's just the price of doing business. you said the hotel was on fire. is it still on fire?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no, it's out.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{good, sprinkler system worked like a charm. now, you wanna leave, you've had enough. perfectly understandable. i will take care of everything else. the only thing i ask is that you take care of chester rush. then you can leave.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{now, look }
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{ted, he's a very important guest of this hotel. in fact, he is the most important guest at the hotel. the mon signor used to be a haven for movie stars. through the thirties and forties, and the first half of the fifties, more movie stars if you break it down on a night by night basis stayed at the mon signor than any other hotel in hollywood. now, we had some hard time in the eighties, even though we were the official hotel of cannon pictures, but we're coming back strong in the nineties. and a movie star clientele is important to that comeback. if we can keep stars of his magnitude happy, we're on our way. so, ted, just take care of him, then you can leave.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, i don't feel like }
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{he probably just wants some champagne! you can do that, can't you? please just take care of him, the entire staff of the mon signor is begging you!}
<A>__{ted crumbles.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay. but get your ass here pronto.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{you're a good man, ted. thanks.}
<A>__{ted hangs up the phone. and picks up the board phone.}

<A>__{the elevator door opens and ted wheels out his tray into the hallway. there's been a bit of an effort to make himself appear a bit less disheveled than in the last scene. he's only minorly successful in the attempt. his uniform still looks like shit, his hair looks tousled, and he walks with a limp. he wheels the cart up to the penthouse door and knocks at the door. a woman opens the door, it's angela from alex's story.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{hi, theodore.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing here?}

<L>__{interior penthouse night}
<A>__{the penthouse is huge, far and away the best suite in the house. and standing in the middle of the biggest room in the hotel is the hottest, newest comedy star to burst onto the hollywood scene in nearly a decade: chester rush. at this moment in time, he's the king, and he has the swagger of a new king. after only one movie, he's pulled the sword out of the stone. and the look on his face says, "king's good." surrounding him is his entourage. they all look like once upon a time this evening they were dressed sharp; however, at this late hour, everybody looks about as disheveled as ted. one of the lads, norman, has planted roots in a comfy chair with his leg thrown over the arm and a bottle of jim beam in his hand. the second guy, leo, is in the back of the room pacing back and forth on the telephone. he is completely oblivious to the rest of the room's activity. in chester's hand is an ever present glass of champagne, which he constantly spills as he gestures wildly. around the room are the leftovers: pizza boxes, fast food hamburgers, and empty bottles of cristal champagne.}

<A>__{chester rises from the couch.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{so, ted the bellboy, as i was saying would you care for some champagne? that's not what i was saying, but would you care for some champagne?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{ya sure? cristal. it's the best. i never liked champagne before i had cristal, now i love it.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay, yeah, sure.}
<A>__{as chester goes and pours ted a glass:}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{ as i was saying, ted, don't worry about being late. for our purposes, promptness is far behind thoroughness.}

<C>__{chester}
<D>__{chin chin.}
<A>__{they clink glasses and drink.}
<C>__{chester}

<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's fuckin' good.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{you bet your sweet bippy, ted. it's fuckin' cristal, everything else is piss.}

<P>__{(to norman)}
<D>__{knock it off, you're making my friend ted here uneasy.}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{pay no attention to norman here, ted, he's just fuckin' wit' ya, that's all. that's from quadrophenia. now me, myself, when i think of bellboys i think of "bellboy" isn't an insult, is it? is there another name for what you do that i'm ignorant of? bellman, bellperson }
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{bellboy's fine.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{good. i'm glad they haven't changed that. there's a friendliness to "bellboy." as i was saying, ted, when norman thinks of bellboys, he thinks of quadrophenia.}
<A>__{but me, when i think of bellboys, i think of the bellboy, with jerry lewis. didja ever see the bellboy?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{you should, it's one of jerry's better movies. he never says a word through the entire film. a completely silent performance. how many actors can pull that off? and he has to go to france to get respect. that says it all about america right there. the minute jerry lewis dies, every paper in this fuckin' country gonna write articles calling the man a genius. it's not right. it's not right and it's not fair. but why should that surprise anybody? when has america ever been fair? we might be right every once in a while, but we're very rarely fair.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{where do you want this?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{you in a hurry, ted?}

<C>__{ted}

<D>__{no.}

<P>__{(arm around ted)}
<D>__{the man sitting in the chair, with the bottle of jim bean in his hand and the sense of humor, is norman. norman, say hello to ted.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what's up?}
<A>__{norman shakes his hand.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{the sociable son of a bitch on the telephone is leo. and the person on the other end of the phone is his lovely wife ellen.}

<C>__{leo}
<D>__{hi, ted, glad you could make it.}
<P>__{(back to phone)}
<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what does punctuality have to do with love?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{which brings me to me, chester rush, ted. pleased to meetcha.}
<A>__{chester shakes ted's hand.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i know. i'm sorry i haven't seen your movie.}
<A>__{chester stops. ted wonders if he should have said that. chester walks over to the table and pours himself some more champagne. when he talks now it's slower and somewhat distracted. the tone of the scene starts changing.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{it's quite all right, ted, nothing to feel sorry about. that's why god invented video. but you know, ted, a lot of people did see it.}
<A>__{chester takes a drink of champagne, a disgusted look crosses his face, and he slowly puts it down. his manner gives the room a chill. when he talks, he addresses the room.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{who drank out of this bottle last?}
<A>__{no answer. chester walks over to ted and fills his glass.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{who drank out of this bottle not the other bottles this bottle last?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what's wrong, chester?}
<A>__{he spills the champagne from his glass onto the floor.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{it's fuckin' flat, norman, that's what's wrong. the champagne the fuckin' cristal's fuckin' flat.}
<A>__{chester improvises a temper tantrum about the flat cristal. everyone looks at him, not knowing what to say. even leo walks over to witness. the whole room is uneasy and a little frightened. when chester finishes his tantrum, he turns his attention back to ted. as he talks to him, he opens up another bottle. but it's not the rapid pace delivery chester has done so far. it's more troubled and distracted.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{i was saying, ted, a lot of people did see it. and not just on video, either. leo, what was the final take on domestic?}
<A>__{leo is still in the doorway making sure his boy's cool.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{72.1 million.}
<P>__{(worried tone)}
<D>__{you okay, champ?}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(struggling with bottle)}
<D>__{i'm cool, so talk to your wife.}
<A>__{leo turns his attention back to the phone and goes inside the room.}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{72.1 million dollars. that's before video and before foreign, and before pay tv and before free tv. we're talking fuckin' asses in fuckin' seats.}
<P>__{(he pops the cork)}
<D>__{before all that other shit, the wacky detective made 72.1 million dollars.}
<A>__{chester walks over to ted and fills his glass.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{and my new one, the dog catcher, it's projected to break a hundred.}
<P>__{(he clinks ted's glass with his)}
<D>__{the dog catcher.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{the dog catcher.}
<A>__{they both drink. the tantrum's over, and chester's back to his fast talking, good natured self.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{now let's stroll over here and see what goodies you brought us.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{do you mind me asking what's all this stuff for?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{one thing at a time, ted. i'm not a frog and you're not a bunny, so let's not jump ahead. c'mon, norman, you should be interested in this.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{damn skippy!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{tell it.}
<A>__{ted produces the things they called for.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{a block of wood.}
<A>__{chester knocks on it.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{three nails.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{why three nails?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{that's how many peter lorre asked for. continue, ted.}
<A>__{ted is completely bewildered.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{a roll of twine.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{that's definitely a roll of twine. continue.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{a bucket of ice.}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(to norman)}
<D>__{you into it?}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(to chester)}
<D>__{i'm into it.}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{a donut.}
<A>__{chester takes it and eats it.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{that's for me. continue.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{and a hatchet.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{a hatchet as sharp as the devil himself is what i asked for.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well, you be the judge.}
<A>__{ted holds the hatchet out for chester to take. norman snatches it instead.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i will be the judge.}
<A>__{norman touches the end of the blade with his thumb.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{whadya think?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{that's a sharp motherfucker. bring all this bullshit over to the bar.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{you heard him, ted.}
<A>__{ted is completely confused and starting to get a little scared, but he does what he's told. leo slams down the phone.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{bitch!}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you still married?}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{maybe, maybe not, but i don't give a flyin' fuck either way. i've had it with that machiavellian bitch! i'm too drunk to drive home. i'm sorry about that, i'm real sorry about that. i got drunk on new year's eve, cut my fuckin' head off...}
<P>__{(noticing ted at the bar)}
<D>__{what's going on here?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{we now return you to the man from rio, already in progress.}
<C>__{leo}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{noooo, you're gonna do it?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{looks like.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{you guys ain't bullshittin', you're gonna really go for it?}
<A>__{angela is still curled up.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{after talkin' about it all night, they better. i wanna see a show.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{when we do it, you'll have something to see.}
<A>__{leo walks up to norman and throws his arm around him.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{you are one radical dude.}
<A>__{ted doesn't know what anybody's talking about, which is just fine with him. he finishes laying out everything on the bar and says:}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well, that's everything, so if you don't need me for anything else, i will go back downstairs.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{not so fast, ted. we ain't quite done yet. why don't you take a seat at the bar, get comfortable, and have an open mind when we explain the festivities of the evening to you.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, guys, you paid for the room. as long as you don't break up the furniture, you can do whatever the fuck you want. and me personally, i don't care if you break up the furniture. you don't have to explain anything to me. whatever constitutes a good time as far as you guys are concerned is your business.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{well, it's your business, ted. 'cause we want you to take part.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{take part in what?}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{chester, your way of breaking the news to him gently is scarin' the shit outta him.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{look at the poor guy. just spit it out.}
<A>__{little by little everybody has gathered around ted.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{first off, let me say that there's nothing homosexual about what we're going to ask you to do. there's nothing sexual at all about what we want. but i was thinkin' you might be thinkin' we want you to do some sex thing. pee on us, suck us off, shit like that. let me assure you nothing could be farther from what we want }
<A>__{angela interrupts:}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{can i jump in here?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{no, you can't jump in here, this is my story.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{theodore's been here fifteen minutes and you've talked about everything but.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{hey, if you don't like it, you can get the fuck out.}
<A>__{leo taps his champagne glass with a tiny spoon, shutting everybody up.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{if it'll please the court, let me explain to ted our intentions.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{i second the nomination!}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{move the nomination be closed!}
<A>__{chester takes the hatchet and brings it down on the bar like a hatchet.}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{leo, the floor is yours.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{ted, did you ever watch the old "alfred hitchcock show"?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(totally bewildered at this point)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{did you ever see the episode the man from rio, with peter lorre and steve mcqueen?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{oh, you'd remember it all right. in the show, peter lorre makes a bet that steve mcqueen can't light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row. now if steve mcqueen can light his cigarette lighter ten times in a row, he wins peter lorre's new car. if he can't he loses his little finger.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{norman and chester just made the same bet.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{norman's putting up his pinky against chester's mint convertible, 1964 red convertible chevy corvelle that he can light his zippo ten times in a row.}
<A>__{pause. ted looks at all of them, taking in the information, before saying:}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you guys are drunk.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{well, that goes without saying, but that doesn't mean we don't know what we're doing.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i will tell ya what i'm doin'.}
<A>__{norman lays an issue of hot classic cars in front of ted on the bar. on the cover is a picture of chester smiling, standing next to a beautiful 1964 red convertible chevy corvelle. the headline reads: "hollywood's hottest new star next to america's hottest old car."}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i drive a motherfuckin' honda my sister sold me. you hear what i'm sayin'? a little white motherfuckin' honda civic.}
<P>__{(he holds up the magazine)}
<D>__{you see this shit?!}
<P>__{(reading the magazine)}
<D>__{"hollywood's hottest new star, next to america's hottest old car."}
<P>__{(he hands ted the magazine)}
<D>__{now you take a good look at that machine that this motherfucker over here is standing next to. that's a 1964 nigger red, rag top chevy corvelle. and i love that car more'n i love hips, lips, and fingertips. cut to we sittin' here celebrating, gettin' high, drinkin' champagne }
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{ cristal. when you're drinkin' anything else, you're drinking champagne. when you're drinkin' cristal, you say you're drinkin' cristal.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{ drinkin' cristal. watchin' tv. "rockin' new year's eve." when all of a sudden we flip on steve mcqueen and peter lorre bein' fuckin' badass. and i look at this funny motherfucker over here, and i say, "i'd do that for the chevelle."}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{and chester replies...}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{"...oh, really?"}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you guys wouldn't be doin' something this stupid unless you were drunk.}
<A>__{everybody breaks into a "here, here" murmur.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i think that pretty much goes without sayin'. we'd probably chicken out. but when you're fucked up, you don't lie. you tell the fuckin' truth. and the fuckin' truth is, my lucky zippo's gonna win me chester's car.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(to chester)}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{thrill of the bet. i'm the one with something to lose here. 'cause i can pretty near guarantee that i love my car more'n norman loves his pinky.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(to leo)}
<D>__{how 'bout you guys, you're just gonna sit back and let your friends mutilate each other?}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{why not? life don't get much more exciting than this. i mean if norman was puttin' his dick on the choppin' block, i'd step in, 'cause, ya know in the morning, we'd really regret that. but his pinky? who gives a fuck? i mean theoretically, he could lose that choppin' onions tomorrow. life still goes on.}

<D>__{how 'bout you?}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(to ted)}

<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i don't have a part.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{now, ted, my old granddaddy used ta say: "the less a man makes declarative statements, the less he's apt to look foolish in retrospect." now there're some inherent obstacles in this undertaking. first of all, i'm not some sick fuck like peter lorre on that show, travelin' the countryside collecting fingers. we're all buddies, here. nobody wants norman to lose his finger. we just wanna chop it off. so if fate doesn't smile on ol' norman, we'll put his finger on ice and rush 'im to a hospital, where in all likelihood be able to sew it back on.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{hopefully.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{eighty percent.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{our side.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{so norman's protected. his interests have been looked after. my interests, on the other hand, have not. i am as emotionally attached to my car as norman is physically to his finger. i'm putting up a very expensive piece of machinery on this wager. now, if i lose, i lose, i have no problem with that. i'm a big boy, i knew what i was doing. however, if i win, i wanna win. if norman lights his lighter ten times in a row, he's gonna have no emotional problems about taking my car keys whatsoever. but if i win, it's not inconceivable that leo or myself, at the last minute, might not be able to wield the ax. which brings us full circle to you, ted. sober ted. clear eyed ted. we want you to be the diceman.}
<A>__{pause as they all look at him. angela breaks it.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{helluva night, huh, ted?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i gotta get out of here.}
<A>__{ted abruptly gets up and makes a beeline for the door. chester whips out a hundred dollar bill and quickly calls to ted from his position at the bar.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{ted, i got a hundred dollar bill here with your name on it, whether you do what we ask or not, just to sit back down in the chair for one minute more.}
<A>__{ted spins in his direction.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'm not gonna cut off his finger!}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{maybe you will and maybe you won't, but that has nothing to do with this hundred dollar bill in my hand. you can tell us all to go fuck off and walk right out that door. but if you sit back down and wait sixty seconds before you do it, you'll be a hundred dollars richer.}
<A>__{ted just stands across the room, thinking.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{ted. take the money.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{ted, you're gonna do whatever you want to do. we're just askin' you to indulge us for another minute more. and chester's willin' to pay for it.}
<A>__{ted thinks.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i will take your money, and i will sit back down. but a minute from now, i'm gonna walk out the door, and when i do, there'll be no hard feelings?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{well, i want you to have a bit more of an open mind than that, but, yeah, we'll either convince you or we won't. no hard feelings. right, guys?}
<A>__{everybody agrees. ted wearily sits back down. chester positions himself in front of ted at the bar.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{okay, leo, you be the timekeeper. let us know when one minute begins and when it ends.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{you got it.}
<P>__{(he checks his watch)}
<D>__{gentlemen, start your engines.}
<A>__{chester jumps up and down, loosening up.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{begin!}
<A>__{chester, who talks fast anyway, starts his pitch. it's chester who now plays "beat the clock."}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{okay, pay attention here, ted, i ain't got much time. now i'm gonna make two piles here on the bar.}
<P>__{(he takes the hundred }
<D>__{dollar bill and lays}
<P>__{it out on the bar)}
<D>__{one pile,}
<P>__{(pointing at the hundred dollar bill)}
<D>__{which is yours. and another pile,}
<P>__{(chester whips out a}
<D>__{money roll fat enough to choke a horse to}
<P>__{death)}
<D>__{which could be yours.}
<P>__{(he lays a matching}
<D>__{hundred dollar bill on the bar, starting}
<P>__{a second pile)}
<D>__{now, what you have to be aware of is we're gonna do this bet, one way,}
<P>__{(he lays another}
<D>__{hundred on the end}
<P>__{pile)}
<D>__{or the other.}
<P>__{(he lays another hundred on the pile)}
<D>__{whether it's you who holds the ax,}
<P>__{(he lays another hundred on the pile)}
<D>__{or the desk clerk downstairs,}
<P>__{(he lays another hundred on the pile)}
<D>__{or some bum we yank off the street.}
<P>__{(he lays another hundred on the pile)}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you can buy a lot of soup with that pile.}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(to norman)}
<D>__{shhhh, i'm the closer.}
<P>__{(to the group)}
<D>__{how much is on the bar already? i lost count.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{six hundred.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{six hundred. ted, do you know how long it takes the average american to count to six hundred?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(laying another bill on the pile)}
<D>__{one minute less than it takes to count to seven hundred. you know, ted, a person's life is made up of a zillion little experiences.}
<P>__{(he lays another bill on the pile)}
<D>__{some, which have no meaning, are insignificant and you forget them. and some that stick with you for the rest of your natural life }
<P>__{(he lays another bill on the pile)}
<D>__{ barring alzheimer's of course. now, what we're proposing is so unusual, so outside the norm, that i think it would be a pretty good guess that this will be one of those experiences that sticks. so, since you're gonna be stuck remembering this moment for the rest of your life, you gotta decide what that memory will be.}
<P>__{(he lays down the}
<D>__{last bill on the}
<P>__{pile)}
<D>__{so, are you gonna remember for the next forty years, give or take a decade, how you refused a thousand dollars for one second's worth of work, or how you made a thousand dollars for one second's worth of work?}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{time!}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{well, ted, what's it gonna be?}
<A>__{ted looks at the pile, then looks up. we dolly into his face.}
<B>__{flashback}
<A>__{we see a quick montage of horrendous moments from all the other stories.}
<L>__{interior penthouse night}
<A>__{back to ted.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{the group cheers.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{but when it's over, no matter what happens, i get the money?}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{as long as you do your part, you can take the pile, walk out the door, and not say another word.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{let's do it right now, before i change my mind.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{here, here.}
<A>__{everybody gets in their position by the bar. norman lays his left hand on the block of wood with his pinky sticking out. in his right hand is his zippo lighter, poised and ready to strike. chester hands ted the meat cleaver. ted takes it, raises it up above norman's finger, in position.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect! this is great! this is a moment in time none of us will ever forget.}
<A>__{everybody is crowded around the scene, on pins and needles.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{norman, you ready?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{ready!}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{ted, you ready?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{ready.}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{okeydoke. norman, begin.}
<A>__{norman looks hard at the zippo in his hand. ted, holding the cleaver, stares focused on norman's pinky. norman readies himself. places his thumb on the wheel in the zippo. takes a breath. and strikes. it sparks, but doesn't light. without missing a beat, ted brings down the cleaver, slicing off norman's pinky. norman lets out a scream. ted, in one move, lays down the cleaver, scoops up the money and walks out the door.}
<L>__{interior hallway after dawn}
<A>__{camera is positioned at far end of hallway, looking down it at the elevator at the other end. ted walks out of the penthouse in the f.g. in a medium shot, he takes the thousand dollars in his hand, looks at it, smiles, and sticks it in his pocket. it might've been a bad night, but it's been a profitable one. he chuckles at the irony, and, whistling a happy tune, turns his back on the camera and walks down the hall to the elevator. all the while we hear pandemonium breaking out behind the door. as ted walks to the elevator, the credits roll. he waits for the elevator, it arrives, he gets in, the doors close. as credits continue to roll, we hold for about two beats... then... the door bursts open and everybody comes piling out. everybody's screaming, yelling different things to one another. norman has a bloody towel wrapped around his hand, he's screaming and crying.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{my finger, my fucking finger!!}
<A>__{chester has the bucket of ice with the finger in it. leo's trying to direct everything. everybody's in frantic activity, except for angela, who stands back, drinks her drink, and watches the show. they all run down the hall, toward the elevator. somebody trips and they all hit the ground. the bucket of ice with the finger goes spilling. they run around like crazy, looking for the finger and picking up ice cubes. norman lies on the floor and screams. they pick it all up, get to the elevator, and push the button. when it arrives, they all dive in except for angela.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you know, i'm gonna call it a night and go back to my room. it's been fun.}
<A>__{the doors close on the screaming maniacs. angela walks through a door marked "stairway."}
<L>__{interior 4th floor hallway after dawn}
<B>__{medium stairway door}
<A>__{credit roll continues angela comes through the door; we steadicam in front of her as she walks the halls, looking for her room. she finds it...}
<B>__{we stop credits}
<C>__{four rooms}
<A>__{angela sticks her key in the door, then stops when she sees something approaching. the look on her face combines strange awe and mild shock. almost floating ethereally, a mysterious blond bombshell, wearing diana's see through negligee and slippers, armed with elspeth's sword slung over her shoulder, wanders toward her. she is in a daze, perhaps lost or drunk.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you okay, lady?}
<A>__{the bombshell looks up at her dizzily.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i said you looking for someone?}
<C>__{diana}
<P>__{(disoriented)}
<D>__{uhhh... yes... my husband... i think. have you seen him?}
<A>__{angela and the girl have a strange moment as they connect through the eyes. having had enough emotional intensity tonight, angela breaks their eye contact.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{lady, i haven't seen anybody.}
<A>__{diana quietly says, "ohhh," as she drifts on down the hall in a daze. angela puts her hand to her temples before opening her hotel door. she does a double take on the hallway empty. she pauses a beat, then walks into her room. after the door closes, we hear sigfried on the other side.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{where the hell have you been?}
<B>__{credits continue to roll}
<C>__{the end}
