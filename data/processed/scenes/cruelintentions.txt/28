<L>__{exterior estate swimming pool night}
<A>__{annette comes down, wearing a bathrobe. she sits by the pool as sebastian treads water away from her.}
<C>__{annette}
<P>__{(holding out the letter)}
<D>__{you know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what? another letter from your friend?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{this is my favorite part.}
<P>__{(reading the letter)}
<D>__{even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. he has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so i might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. how do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{i sincerely doubt it.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{give me the fucking letter.}
<A>__{annette smiles and tears the letter up.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{why did you do that?}
<C>__{annette}

<C>__{sebastian}
<P>__{(mocking)}
<D>__{is that the last thing you need? my your clever.}
<A>__{she takes pieces of paper and sticks it in her bathrobe. she then stands and takes off the robe, revealing a one piece bathing suit underneath.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{how's the water?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{refreshing.}
<A>__{she dives in the pool and surfaces.}

<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{about what you said today in the stable. i'm not a happy person.}

<D>__{i never said that.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you implied it.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{look, i didn't mean to give you a hard time.}

<C>__{annette}
<D>__{because you act like a pig.}

<C>__{annette}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but you're not my type.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{fine. friends it is. i can live with that.}
<A>__{he extends his arms out for a hug. she moves in and hugs him. her smile turns to a look of horror.}
