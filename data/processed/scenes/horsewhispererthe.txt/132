<L>__{exterior the double divide early morning}
<A>__{tom rides a young colt along the creek. he hears footsteps. he turns and sees annie running along the creek on the other side. he stops to watch. when his horse snorts, annie looks up to see him. she stops. he tips his hat to her.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{a jogger, huh?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i don't jog, mr. booker. i run.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{lucky for you. the grizzlies around here only go for joggers.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{if i can survive rush hour, i figure i can handle grizzlies...}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you sleeping all right in that house?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i don't sleep all right anywhere. but the house is fine.}
<A>__{tom walks his horse across the creek to her, comfortable in the silence. annie moves about, uncomfortable in the waiting.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{who's r.b.?}
<A>__{tom is finding annie's blunt curiosity more endearing.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{sorry about that. i thought everything got cleared out. r.b. is my wife... ex wife... rachel. we used to live in that house together.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i thought you lived in chicago?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i thought you were an editor, not a reporter?}
<A>__{annie smiles and nods, realizing she's asking too many questions. she tries to casually reach out to touch the horse's head, but it's too abrupt and the horse tosses his head away, taking a couple of steps back. annie is embarrassed.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i have a way with animals.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's all right. he's young. just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh yes. i forgot.}
<A>__{she does and the horse sniffs at her hand.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{he's beautiful.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{why don't you ride anymore? grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{she did?}
<A>__{annie is somewhat moved by her daughter telling him that.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i don't know, really. no time mostly.}
<A>__{a cold wind blows. she folds her arms across her breasts.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i thought it was supposed to be spring.}
<A>__{tom can't help but notice her nipples are hard from the cold. he looks away. she laughs.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{are you shy, mr. booker?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{just polite. well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.}
<A>__{annie is struck by the words "before you go home." tom ambles off on his horse.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{enjoy the day.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you too.}
<A>__{annie steps across the rocks at the ford, crossing the creek. her foot slips, one of her shoes goes into the water.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{need a lift?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i can handle it!}
<A>__{she crosses the creek. she turns, giving him a small wave. he touches his hat. she runs off. tom watches her go, head down, concentrating...}
