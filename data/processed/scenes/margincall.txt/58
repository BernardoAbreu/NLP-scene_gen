<L>__{interior parking garage, basement of office building night}
<A>__{will and seth are sitting waiting for will's car to be brought up. as they wait they see jared cohen come out of the elevator and walk towards them.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{ah fuck, it's jared. he's coming this way.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what does wonderboy want?}
<A>__{will stands up and walks over to jared.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{do you have a minute?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we're heading to get eric dale.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{i know. i just need a second.}
<A>__{they walk away from seth.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{tuld and i have concerns that sam may not be willing to step up and do the right thing here.}
<A>__{will looks around the garage, than back at jared.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i don't think that's ever been a problem.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{of course it hasn't, but during acute situations, such as this, often what is right can take on multiple interpretations.}
<A>__{they look at each other for a long beat as will sizes up the question. in the background the squeals of tires on concrete are heard.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{sam will step up.}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{i know he will...but if he doesn't...}
<A>__{as the question stands unfinished will's convertible flies into frame down a ramp and pulls up next to jared and will. the attendant gets out and before will has a chance jared hands the attendant a tip. jared then looks back at will who is waiting to get in the car.}
<D>__{jared cohen (cont'd) (cont'd) but if he doesn't, we need to know that you will.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that i will what?}
<C>__{jared cohen}
<D>__{step up.}
<A>__{will climbs into the car and shuts the door. he looks at jared through the open window with seth now sitting next to him within earshot.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i have no doubt sam will make the right choice. and if it makes you feel any better he and i have always had the same interpretation of what's right...no matter how acute the situation.}
<A>__{will puts the car in drive and pulls out of the garage leaving jared standing there.}
