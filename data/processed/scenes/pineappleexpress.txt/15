<D>__{...3:09 in the pm and we }
<A>__{dale turns off the radio, takes one last haul, and then snubs out the jointerior he then pulls out a small leather kit and sifts through it's contents: handi wipes, hand sanitizer, a little vial of cologne, visine, mouthwash and breath mints. dale vigorously wipes his hands, face, and mouth with wet naps and then starts futilely attempting to put visine in his blazing red eyes. frustrated, he squirts visine all over his finger tips and simply rubs them into his eyes. he uses the mouthwash, chews up a mint, dabs on some cologne, and then gets out of the car.}
