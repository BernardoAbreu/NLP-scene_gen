<ACTION>__{Race across a field of PEDESTRIANS to pick up three women hurrying down the sidewalk.  LYDIA LYNCH, a real estate broker, vaults down the sidewalk, she's got a hell of a stride.  MEG ALTMAN, thirtyish, struggles to keep up with her, she's tall, wafer-thin, pale as a ghost.  SARAH, a nine year old girl, flat out runs to keep up, dribbling a basketball as she goes.  The kid's athletic, much tougher than Meg, who she resembles. Lydia reads from a sheet she carries in her bouncing hands.}

<DIAL>__{Oh, that miserable little prick is already leaving.}
<ACTION>__{They approach a row of brownstones, narrow four story townhouses, nice looking buildings, a hundred years old or more.  EVAN, a sour-looking man, has just locked the front door of number 26 and is coming down the steps.  He sees them coming.}

<LOC>__{INT.  TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Evan throws open the front door, revealing the airy foyer of the townhouse.  The place is completely empty.  He talks fast, races through the tour.  The three of them come in, Sarah still bouncing her basketball.}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This is the middle of the house, the entry floor, living room's over there.  The kitchen floor's below us and there's two bedroom floors above.}
<ACTION>__{The front door closes behind them, with a THUD so authoritative it seems to say no one's ever getting out.  Meg tries to get her daughter's attention, to tell her to stop bouncing the ball in the house.}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's an enormous amount of space for the money and I'll be perfectly honest, the family is in no hurry whatsoever.}

<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.}
<CHAR>__{LYDIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No ball, kid.}
<ACTION>__{Sarah immediately stops bouncing.  She wanders into the living room, peers through the big French doors, which look out over the courtyard area.  There's another row of brownstones on the next block, and all the patios back up to one another.  It looks tranquil out there, oasis in the city. Sarah leans up against the door, sighs, her breath fogs the window.  There is a profound melancholy about her.  Meg watches her, tries to catch eyes with her in the reflection. Can't. Evan flings open the door of an old-fashioned cage-style elevator.}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.}

<CHAR>__{SARAH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's not like Saks', Mom, you don't have to pay the price on the tag.}
<ACTION>__{She gets in the elevator and RATTLES the door shut with a bang.  That kid's got an attitude.  Meg takes a deep breath, turns to Lydia.  She brushes her hair behind an ear, we notice her thin hand is shaking.}
<CHAR>__{MEG} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry.  Apartments, and... money, and... this is more my husband's area.}

<DIAL>__{Things, and if I can't prove to my soon to-be ex-husband that I can provide a suitable place for our daughter to live in the next fourteen days, it's going to get ugly between us.  Uglier.}

<DIAL>__{Master closet.}
<ACTION>__{From the hallway, there is a GROANING METALLIC sound, the elevator, and the happy laughter of the little girl as she puts it through its paces.  Evan winces, speaks as if his mouth hurts when he moves it.}

<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And we emerge in the master bedroom.}
<ACTION>__{He checks his watch. Meg looks around, studying the dimensions of the room.  She looks at the far wall, the one that borders the house next door.  She looks at the wall that corners it, opposite the window wall.  She takes two steps back from it.}
<CHAR>__{MEG} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Something's weird.}
<CHAR>__{LYDIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What?}
<CHAR>__{MEG} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?}
<ACTION>__{She points to the far end of the wall, near the entrance to the closet.  There is a mirrored door that leads to the closet, and a mirror on the wall alongside it.  If you look closely, you'll see that the mirrors are raked slightly toward one another, which causes an optical illusion in which the corner of the room appears much closer to the door than it is.}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I was waiting to see if you'd notice!  On caravan, no one from our office had the slightest idea.}
<ACTION>__{He pushes on the top of the mirror on the wall.  It makes a faint CLICK, then glides open a few inches off the wall.  He pulls it toward him, opens it all the way, a hundred eighty degrees, and it fastens magnetically to the back of the closed door.  There is smooth wall behind it, but if you look closely, there is a faint vertical crack in the wall. Meg looks at him -- what in the world?  Even pushes again, twice this time, first at the top, then at the bottom, and the smooth wall CLICKS ajar.  He pulls it wide open.  Meg and Lydia step forward, fascinated.}
<LOC>__{INT.  PANIC ROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{From the opposite end of a lone, narrow, windowless space, we see the three of them standing in the open doorway, silhouetted by the sunlight streaming through the bedroom windows behind them.}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's called a panic room.}
<ACTION>__{He hits a switch and a row of bulbs flick on overhead.}
<CHAR>__{MEG} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A what?}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.}
<CHAR>__{LYDIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, I've seen these...}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.}
<ACTION>__{The other two walk inside, but Meg lingers near the door, looking around, studying the neatly arrayed survival supplies -- water, food packs, batteries, flashlights, tools, rope, clothes, blankets -- you get the idea.}
<CHAR>__{LYDIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, this is perfect for you...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Meg scoffs)}
<DIAL>__{Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --}
<ACTION>__{He hits a switch next to a dozen tiny video monitors, revealing a dozen different views of the house.}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{MEG} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(giving up)}
<DIAL>__{What's to keep them from prying open the door?}
<ACTION>__{Evan reaches past Meg and pushes a red button on the wall behind her.  With a sudden WHANG of steel, a heavy metal door leaps out of a slot in the wall and SLAMS shut, like a submarine hatch.  A series of metal latches CLICK into place inside it, from top to bottom, securing it into place.}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Steel, four inches thick.}
<ACTION>__{Meg takes a step back.  They're now enclosed in the room.}

<DIAL>__{Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?}
<CHAR>__{MEG} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Open the door.}
<CHAR>__{LYDIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's highly inappropriate.}
<CHAR>__{MEG} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I said open the door.}
<ACTION>__{Evan hits a green button and the door GROANS slowly open, recoiling its massive spring, and revealing Sarah, the little girl, standing in the entryway, grinning widely.}
<CHAR>__{SARAH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{My room.  Definitely my room.}
<ACTION>__{She bolts in, just as her mother bolts out.}
<LOC>__{INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Meg stands just outside the door to the panic room, regaining her composure.  Not crazy about tight spaces.  Which we already knew.}
<CHAR>__{LYDIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That door is a safely hazard.}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not at all.}
<ACTION>__{He points.  There's a tiny red beam that shines across the doorway, one at shoulder height --}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Infrared.  Like the beam in an elevator doorway.  Won't let the door close if something's blocking it.}
<ACTION>__{-- and one at shin height.  Even bend down, blocks the one at shin height with his hand.}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Watch.}
<ACTION>__{He reaches up, to push the close button, but with one hand anchored at the floor, he can't quite reach it.}
<CHAR>__{EVAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Lydia)}
<DIAL>__{Push that button for me, will you?}
<CHAR>__{MEG} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't!}
<ACTION>__{Lydia pushes the close button, nothing happens.  Evan pulls his hand put of the beam, takes a step back.  Lydia pushes the button again. WHANG!  The metal door rockets shut, the metallic slang reverberating in the room.  Almost immediately, the fake piece of wall HUMS shut, of its own accord, followed a moment later by the mirror, which detaches itself from the back of the closet door and HUMS silently back into place, closing over the hidden door, making the corner of the room look like a corner again. As the mirrored door closes, it shows Meg her own reflection. She looks at herself, still rattled.  She wipes a trickle of sweat from the side of her face.}

Whatever she pushed turned these on too, probably not what she meant to do, but at least she got the alarm on for the night. The door that leads from the panic room to the master bedroom hangs open.  In the middle of the floor in here, somebody has made a small tent of blankets and couch cushions.  Sarah must have been playing here before bed.}

<ACTION>__{Meg puts sheets on her bed in the master bedroom. She fills a glass of water, puts it on a box she's using for a night table. She plugs in a battery charger for her cell phone, places the phone in the cradle.  It BEEPS.  "Charging." She sets the digital clock, puts it next to the glass of water.  It's 12:26. She gets in bed, her side, the left side. She lies in the dark, half an acre of empty bed across from her. We drift off her, see the clock again.  The time changes, the number one dissolves away, changing the time to --}
<TRANS>__{DISSOLVE TO:}
<LOC>__{INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{-- 2:26.  Meg is in a hard, boozy sleep.  We drift out the door of the master bedroom, into the third floor hallway, and down the open stairwell.  We glide through the entry floor, still gently falling through the stairwell's airway, dropping even further, all the way down to the kitchen floor, the ground floor. We drift across the darkened kitchen, serpentine through the canyon of moving boxes, approach the window that looks out on the street. We move right up against the window, peer through the glass just as -- -- a van pulls up across the street and stops.  Can't see through its windows.  No movement for a moment, then the driver's door opens and a MAN climbs out.  He wears dark clothes. The Man closes the door, looks both ways, and starts across the street towards us.  He's carrying a bag of some kind. He goes to the door, and we drift down toward the doorknob. We hear a key slide into the door, rattle. But the lock doesn't turn.  The key slides out, back in again, jiggles.  Still won't open the door. The Man steps away from the door, goes to the kitchen window, which is heavily barred, and peers inside, right at us. Can't see anything, it's darker in here than it is out there. He turns, looks both ways on the street again, then steps up, onto the window ledge.  Now we can only see his legs, can't tell what he's doing.  He's reaching up, stretching for something.  It drops into view with a metallic SCRAPE. The fire escape. The Man climbs, his feet disappearing from our field of vision. We turn around, facing the other way in the kitchen.  We start back the way we came, through the canyon of boxes in the kitchen, toward the stairwell.}
<LOC>__{INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Back in the stairwell, the exact reverse of the shot we saw earlier.  We're drifting up, off the kitchen floor, through the entry floor, and as we rise we notice something all the way up on the roof that we couldn't see before, when we were looking down. A skylight.  We continue to rise, drawn toward it.  We move up, through the master bedroom floor, creeping up alongside the stair banister, now reaching the top floor of the house, and just as we near the skylight -- -- a figure appears, visible through it.  The Man in dark clothes, on the roof now.  He stops, peers down through the skylight, looking at us without seeing us again. He steps across the skylight.  This is not the way he intends to enter.  We drift again, following his soft footsteps on the roof, which we can hear faintly through the ceiling. Here in the hall, just outside Sarah's bedroom, a closet door is ajar.  We squeeze through the gap and into the closet. IN THE CLOSET, it's completely dark.  Can't see a thing.  But then a sliver of light appears, coming from above.  We look up. There is a ladder that's bolted to the wall in this closet, it leads up to a square panel in the ceiling. Roof access.  And that roof access panel is moving, ever so slightly, moonlight spilling in as it twists in its setting. A shiny silver something slides through the crack along the edges of the portal. It slithers along the edge of the hatchway, searching for something.  It finds a small round nub in the crack.  The silver something stops.  It HUMS with electricity for a moment, then there is a bright spark and a soft CRACK.}

<ACTION>__{In the closet, the silver something withdraws and the roof access panel is removed.  A million stars are visible in the night sky above.  But we're inside. And in a moment, so is this intruder.  The Man peers down, through the open hatchway, then slips through the opening and climbs silently down the ladder.}
<LOC>__{INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{In bed, Meg stirs.  An alcohol sleep is a restless one, and she's suffering. She sits up groggily, chugs a glass of water.  Lies down again.}
<LOC>__{INT.  FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{One floor up, the Man steps into the hallway and starts for the stairs, moving quickly and confidently.  Knows where he's going, knows what he wants.  He starts down the stairs, happens to glance to the side as he does so. He freezes.  He's looking in the open doorway of the top floor bathroom, staring hard at something that clearly disturbs him.

As the sheetrock tears away, we see the skeleton of the wall behind it.  There's a latticework of two by four studs, and beyond those the dull shine of the wall's metal core. But that's not what he's after.  He continues tearing, reveals an air duct running through the wall, feeding into the panic room through a welded hole in the steel.  Burnham tears away with the hammer, exposing a short section of the duct. CLANG!  The claw hammer drops into an opened toolbox. Burnham drops to his knees, rips open another tool case. This one has a sophisticated looking power drill in it, along with a couple dozen specialized bits.  He selects one, twists it into the drill. At the wall, Burnham puts drill to metal and hits the switch. A horrendous METAL SCREECH fills the air and the drill bit tears into the duct, opening up a jagged hole about the size of a quarter. Raoul hurries through the doorway of the bedroom, carrying a coiled garden hose.  Burnham snaps his fingers for it, Raoul tosses it to him, holding one end, and the hose uncoils in the air as it snakes across the room. Burnham shoves the end of the garden hose into the hole he's just drilled in the air duct. RIP!  He tears off a length of duct tape and seals the connection, makes it airtight. SLIT!  Using a large hunting knife, Raoul hacks a ten foot section of the garden hose off the coil. He stretches it out, across the room, to the white five gallon tank we saw before, which is now sitting on the floor up here.

In response, Meg picks up two or three of the fireproof blankets and piles them over Sarah, right up to her disbelieving eyes.  She bends down, takes another gulp of air.  but she's getting woozy.

She drops to the floor of the room, covering her daughter's body just as the entire ceiling of the panic room turns into a lake of fire with a deafening WHOOMP.  The fluorescent light tubes EXPLODE, showering glass everywhere. IN THE BEDROOM, the blue flame shoots out of the wall, into the hose, through the hose, backing up toward the tank. Burnham CRUNCHES to the floor next to the tank, knocking the other end of the hose away from the spigot just as the blue flame erupts from the end of the hose. The flame engulfs his entire body, his hair starts on fire, his chest, his arms.  Raoul lunges forward, Junior tears the blankets from the bed and throws them over him, Burnham HOWLS and rolls on the floor in pain. IN THE PANIC ROOM, the blue cloud on the ceiling suddenly evaporates with another angry WHOOMP, leaving a few little pockets of flame that Meg extinguishes by swatting with a blanket.  Only one of the fluorescent lights is left intact; it casts a flickering, uneven light on the room. She stands in the middle of the still-smoky panic room, breathing hard.  She shouts, SCREAMS incomprehensibly, making no sense whatsoever. She stops, noticing the look Sarah is giving her.  Wide-eyed admiring, frightened, you are an insane woman. Meg looks to herself.  Her arm is signed, the hair burned off.  The sleeve of her T-shirt is burned back to the shoulder.  Her face is sooty, blackened. Meg GRUNTS, half frightened by herself.}

<ACTION>__{THUNK.  Meg's head falls back against a wall; she sags to the floor, legs folded in front of her, completely drained. But Sarah's not drained, Sarah's full of nervous ingenuity, rustling around through the stuff in the panic room, an idea forming in her head.  She finds a powerful-looking flashlight and loads it up with batteries.  She tries it, flashing around the room. Halogen bulb, very powerful, hurts her mother's eyes as she flashes it past.  Meg watches her.  What's she up to? Sarah lays on the floor in front of the ventilation tube she discovered earlier.  She squints through it. THROUGH THE TUBE, she can see out of the house, into the courtyard behind the brownstone. About thirty yards away she can see the backs of the brownstones on the next block, and directly across (because the tube doesn't leave much room for lateral vision) she can see straight into somebody's bedroom. There's a light on.  A SLEEPING MAN is in bed, an open book on his chest. IN THE PANIC ROOM, Sarah sits back. She grabs the flashlight, looks for a little button on the top, the kind you can flick the flashlight on and off with. Shining it on the wall of the panic room, she flashes it at a wall, three times, on and off.  Satisfied, she turns back to the tube. Meg, curious, crawls across the floor to join her.  Sarah shoves the flashlight all the way into the tube, leaving enough room on either side of it for them to see through. Meg lays down flat, squints into the tube, Sarah alongside her.  She looks at her daughter, curious -- your plan? Sarah reaches into the tube, finds the little flash button on the top of the flashlight. THROUGH THE TUBE, the piercing halogen beam begins to flash, across the courtyard and into the bedroom of the Man in the bedroom. The light flashes on the wall over his bed. The flashes are in a rhythm.  Short.  Short.  Short.  Long. Long.  Long.  Short.  Short.  Short. IN THE PANIC ROOM, Meg turns to Sarah, impressed.}

Raoul jabs the button -- -- just as Sarah throws her hand into the upper beam, the one at shoulder level.  Sarah's hand turns red, the beam is broken, the door will not close.

Burnham stands there, looking down at Meg and Sarah. They stare at each other, wordless, their first face to face contact.  She sees the bonds protruding from his jacket. She just looks at him.

<ACTION>__{Burnham races down the steps, hurries to the entry door, throws it open -- -- and finds a gun barrel pointed directly into his nose.  He blinks, tries to focus on whoever's on the other end of that gun. It's the Cop, the first Cop, the one who came to the door and was so suspicious of Meg.  The Cop looks down, sees blood smeared all over Burnham's jacket, sees more than enough to know his suspicions were correct.}
<CHAR>__{COP 1} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Put your hands up.}
<ACTION>__{Burnham freezes, silhouetted in the doorway.  Wind and leaves blow into the house, a real gale outside. From behind Cop 1, MORE COPS SHOUT, all at once, must be a half dozen of 'em there, but Burnham can't see anything in the stinging light, and can't hear much either, over the ROARING wind. Burnham moves suddenly, flinging the door shut right in the Cop's face.  The door SLAMS hard, Burnham turns to run but doesn't get more than a few paces before three sharp GUNSHOTS CRACK through the door behind him. Brilliant white light spills through the bulletholes in the door, but it's not the light that gets you, it's the chunks of lead.  They rip through Burnham's back and come out his chest, a triangle pattern. Burnham stops, sags to his knees.  He reaches into his jacket, pulls out the loose stack of bonds. He fans them out, stares down at them, holds them like playing cards.}
<CHAR>__{BURNHAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Monster hand.}
<ACTION>__{Behind him, the front door CRACKS open, half a dozen COPS appear and start SHOUTING, all at once.  Burnham tosses the bonds to the floor, the same gesture as folding a hand of poker. He GROANS and collapses, slowly, falling through the bonds, twisting as he goes down.  He SLAPS onto his back in the foyer as the wind gusts through the open door, scoops the bonds up off the floor, and blows them back into the house, as if they were never meant to leave. Burnham lies there on the floor, eyes open, staring up at the ceiling, looking at the bonds that swirl in the blast of air, suspended there, twisting and bucking and diving just over his head as he dies.}

<LOC>__{EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - GREAT LAWN - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The swirling bonds melt into swirling leaves, blowing in the air over Central Park on a crisp fall day.  The leaves float down, over the Great Lawn, that massive expanse of grass we saw in Meg's hallucination. But on a day like this the Great Lawn's full of people, throwing frisbees, playing football, lying there doing nothing. The leaves land on the grass next to Meg and Sarah, stretched out on a blanket, a newspaper spread in front of them, open to the ads. Meg is on her back, arms folded behind her head, staring up at the clouds. Sarah is intent on the paper, circling the occasional ad.}

<DIAL>__{I mean, uptown is close to Dad's place, but somebody at school said the Village is really cool, so... I don't know, it's so great to be close to the park and everything... What do you think, I mean, give me a clue, here, where are we gonna live?}
<ACTION>__{Meg rolls over, props herself up on one elbow.  She seems years younger.  She looks at Sarah, reaches out, brushes her daughter's hair behind one ear. She smiles.  She is calm. Behind her, a flock of pigeons takes off, leaping into the clear autumn sky.}
