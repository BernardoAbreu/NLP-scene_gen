<L>__{interior study hall campus library day}
<A>__{autumn is tutoring darnell, checking her lesson notes.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{o.k., using the things we worked on yesterday, i want you to write a two or three page essay on some aspect of your life. something other than football.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{your father, maybe. you could write about your dad.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{don't know that much about him. he was off in detroit workin' in a car plant when i was born. got laid off, tried to rob a jewelry store to get us some money. he died in prison. some kinda heart problem.}
<A>__{autumn wasn't ready for this level of hardship. she tries to press on gamely.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{how about your mother?}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{she was always workin'. usually two jobs. comin' home one night she stopped to get us some root beer. got caught in a gang crossfire. shot three times... died on the way to the hospital. you want me to write about that?}
<C>__{autumn}
<P>__{(blown away)}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{good, 'cause none of it's true.}
<A>__{autumn jumps up.}
<C>__{autumn}
<P>__{(raising her voice)}
<D>__{jesus christ, darnell what a terrible thing to do to somebody. that's not funny. that's sick.}
<A>__{autumn realizes she's in the library and sits back down.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{had ya goin', didn't i?}
<C>__{autumn}
<P>__{(soft library voice)}
<D>__{no you didn't. you just... how could you make up somethin' like that?}
<C>__{darnell}
<P>__{(contrite now)}
<D>__{sounded more interesting than the truth. my mom took a vacation to chicago when i was 12. never came back. don't know who my dad was.}
<A>__{autumn's anger melts away in the face of this painful truth.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{who took care of you?}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{i started hangin' with the j.b.m., gang bangin'... did some time in the hall. reverand wallace saw me playin' football on a juvenile probation team. took me in, got me into high school. only reason they accepted me was 'cause i could play football. sorta like here. football saved my life. i'd be nowhere without football.}
<A>__{autumn just nods, still trying to take this all in.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{well, then... maybe you could write about football this once.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{yeh, o.k... thanks.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i've seen a lotta shitty things in my life, autumn. that's why i know when i see somethin' good.}
<A>__{autumn knows this is no line. he means it. she's seeing him with new eyes. moved by his pain, engaged by his sincerity, and more than a little taken by his regard for her.}
<B>__{on alvin}
<A>__{across the room with his tutor.}
<C>__{tutor}
<D>__{let's review the chapter i read you yesterday. which two city states fought in the punic wars?}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{i dunno. detroit and buffalo.}
<C>__{tutor}
<D>__{c'mon, alvin. you're gonna be tested on this.}
