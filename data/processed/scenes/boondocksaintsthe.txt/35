<L>__{exterior alley morning}
<A>__{(slo mo) checkov begins to laugh heartily. the tank top lands pristinely on a garbage bag just behind murphy. ivan's look turns to one of terror. bam! he is crushed by the toilet. boom! his gun goes off, punching a hole in the dumpster near the bottom. vladdy hears the bang and crouches as he turns to see a wave of tiny porcelain bits. connor lands squarely on vladdy's back. his gun discharges firing a hole in the brick of the opposing wall. he is savagely crushed against the ground. connor bounces off and hits the wall, landing in the garbage completely unconscious. murphy takes his hands from his head. there is dead silence. he runs to his brother, pulls him from the trash and checks his vital signs. he seems okay. vladdy, still alive, slowly crawls for his gun, inadvertently covering his own bullet casing. murphy goes over, picks up the tank cover and clubs the man to death with two hard and fast blows, then throws it up and behind him. it lands in the dumpster with a resonating boom. murphy quickly takes everything from the scene; guns, money, wallets, watches and a pager. he shoves it in a garbage bag and throws connor over his shoulder and runs out of the alley.}
