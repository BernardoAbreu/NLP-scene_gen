The Gremlin FALLS... it's like an eternity... He smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces. ON FINN - Now set upon by 20 or 30 MORE pursuing cars. He has nowhere to go but UP UP UP a ramp toward the helipad. He spies some GASOLINE BARRELS, fires a SINGLE BULLET which cuts through its leather straps, sending barrels DOWN the ramp, PAST FINN --- --- PAST the pursuing CARS --- --- to the bottom where they EXPLODE in a CHAIN REACTION back UP THE RAMP, taking out at least 15 CARS! ON THE HELIPAD - Finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. No more road. Nowhere else to go. The 20 BAD GUY CARS that are still in pursuit surround him, fire up their blowtorches. About to pounce. Finn GRINS. The second time we've seen this grin. It means he's got something cooking. Finn's REVERSE LIGHTS appear. He DRIVES BACKWARD off the edge of the helipad to the SHOCK of the other cars. Finn falls. He turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly cutting into the water. He EMERGES, now sprouting HYDROFOIL and speeds away.}
