<L>__{exterior brooklyn street day}
<A>__{a brooklyn slum street on a morning in november. it is about 11 o'clock and relatively quiet. a scattering of tenement urchins give the street some sound and life. there are a couple of dark shops on the street and a bar, all appearing to be closed. we look down the street and pick up doyle and russo coming down it, walking very quickly. they are heading toward the bar. a young man is coming out they grab him and throw him back.}
