<A>__{victoria walks through the ornate chapel, nervously fingering her handkerchief. waiting for her, smiling softly, is the dean of windsor, dean wellselly.}
<C>__{dean wellselly}
<D>__{you wished to see me, ma'am?}
<A>__{she holds his eyes for a moment, then nods.}
<L>__{interior windsor castle, chapel day}
<A>__{a few minutes later, victoria and dean wellselly are seated in a corner of the chapel, talking softly. she cannot bring herself to look at him and so does not notice how carefully he is watching her throughout the interview. this is incredibly hard for her to say, but she struggles to be as honest as possible.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{my husband tried always to make me think more subtly. of course he taught me so much and i can never repay my debt to him, or the love i feel, even now. but, in truth, i think i am someone who can only feel things while they are alive to me. for that reason, i know i do not have a subtle mind. i know that. but i work hard and i try to do my duty.}
<P>__{(she hesitates; she is struggling now)}
<D>__{however, i have noticed of late that my feelings of grief are not so strong and that i find myself leaning more upon the comfort of living friends.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{friends close to me now.}
<A>__{she stops herself. she is crying. dean wellselly watches her a moment, then speaks close, choosing his words carefully.}
<C>__{dean wellselly}
<D>__{your majesty, a settled resignation is more lasting proof of affection than active grief. if the good lord sees fit to bring one into contact with congenial fellow beings, one should not analyze one's reaction too deeply. to allow oneself to be comforted by someone else need not imply any disloyalty to the memory of the loved one.}
<A>__{silence. victoria stares into the long, dark chapel. gradually, as she takes in the tone of his remarks, her disappointment turns to anger.}
