<L>__{int santa maria della vittoria night}
<A>__{as firemen put out the last of the flames (not using water, but halon gas, which creates no steam), a metallic tapping sound comes from somewhere. one of the firemen approaches another, gets his attention stop what you're doing and listen. they shut down a hose and stop, listening. there it is again. they shout in italian to the others, now everybody shuts down their hoses and listens. the metallic tapping echoes in the smoldering church. they walk toward it it's coming from an oval plate in the floor, like a manhole cover, heavy and carved. we've seen one of these before, it leads to a demon's hole. the tapping is louder now, rhythmic. somebody's down there. crowbars are produced, the cover of the demon's hole is pried off and shoved aside, revealing robert langdon, wedged into the top of the opening, holding a rock in one hand as he clings precariously to the walls he has climbed. strong hands reach down, haul him to his feet at the front of the church, and those same feet hurry to the front of the smoldering church, coming to a stop in front of bernini's ecstasy of st. teresa. the statue he came here to find. now, as the italian speaking police and firemen work around him, langdon moves, as if in his own world. he looks to the statue, repeating fragments of the poem he has by now memorized:}

<A>__{a moment later, as if by command, a map crinkles out on the floor of the church. it's detailed, a fire department map, and langdon drops down on all fours, studying it.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{we're here... piazza barberini...}
<A>__{langdon whips a glance over at the angel, gets bearings, and rotates the map to match. his finger travels over the map and close on the map, we watch as his finger crosses church after church after church, tiny black boxes with crosses in them. there must be two dozen.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{damn it.}
<A>__{he sits back for a moment. the roman cop bends down next to him. treats him like a crazy person.}
<C>__{roman cop}
<D>__{professor, i need to know what you saw here.}

<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{and st. peter's is...}
<A>__{the cop points to a spot at the bottom center. langdon's eyes widen, he grabs the cop by the lapels and pulls a pen from the man's pocket. he turns back to the map and draws a straight line, from north to south, connecting the two churches the cop just pointed to.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{and we're over here }
<A>__{he puts the pen on a point on the eastern side of the map.}
<C>__{langdon }

<A>__{he draws a line straight across the map, to the west, sucking in his breath as he realizes something.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{'cross rome...}
<A>__{now he stands, slowly, and as he stands, we rise up, to get a birds eye view of the map on the floor. on which he has drawn a perfect cross.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{it's a cross. the poem meant it literally. the four altars of science form a perfect cross.}
<A>__{the cop, who has no clue what he's talking about, gets a call on his radio and turns away to take it.}

<P>__{(muttering to himself)}
