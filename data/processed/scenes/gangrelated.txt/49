<A>__{divinci exits the building. starts to cross the street to his car parked on the opposite side when he hears something behind him. he turns, instantly reaching for his pistol. a drunk staggers out of the alley looks like he has a gun in his hand. divinci instinctively raises his gun to shoot when the light catches the object in the drunk's hand a brown bottle, the neck sticking ahead like the barrel of a gun.}

<A>__{the drunk stops when he hears the voice. looks through his matted greasy hair that cascades in front of his eyes. now we recognize joe. divinci turns away, disgusted. opens his car door, then stops. caught in a thought. he turns back and looks at joe again.}
