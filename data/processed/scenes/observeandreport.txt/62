<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{we usually prefer an actual diploma, but ged is technically acceptable. are you a citizen of the united states?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you bet your ass i am.}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{okay, mr. barnhardt, there are several steps you have to complete in order to be eligible for the police academy. physical evaluation, psychological test, background check.}
<C>__{policeman }
<D>__{if you pass these tests, you will be admitted to the police academy. now, i like to tell all new recruits that they should complete a ride along before making this decision. it's where you actually ride along with a real police officer during a routine patrol. it helps give you an idea of the kind of situations you'll be dealing with. sound good?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that sounds fun. sign me up.}
