<L>__{interior bar room day}
<A>__{the young man is thrown in, followed by doyle and russo. there are about 20 or 30 puetro rican and black men in the joint, a couple of black women. they are in all manner of dress. half of them are wearing shades. the bar is noisy with conversation, laughter and music. doyle and russo standing in the doorway, doyle slightly to the left, russo a little behind him. doyle's arms are at his sides. russo's right hand is crossed over his belt, under his jacket and on the butt of his .38, ready, waiting to back his partner's play or respond to any move within the bar. doyle moving into the bar alone. he pulls the plug out of the juke box, plunging the room to silence.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{hands on your heads. popeye's here!}
<A>__{twenty men raise hands to their heads as one. the raggle taggle swarm plays a kind of human chicken, refusing to move until the last moment then stepping out of his way. one of the customers doesn't.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{what's my name? 1st man doyle.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{what? 1st man mr. doyle.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{ever pick your feet in poughkeepsie? 1st man what?}
<A>__{doyle raises his left arm and pushes the man aside. the man's eyes go to russo, off camera at the door, and back to doyle. he doesn't resist; he gets in line with the rest of them, a line formed about four or five feet from the bar, running the length of it. close of doyle at the bar, holding an ashcan and skimming the metal underrailing with one finger, knocking off the magnetized key boxes into the ashcan. he isn't even looking at them. his eyes are across the bar, staring down the customers. close shot of the ashcan and the little metal boxes clinking into it. close shot of doyle, the ashcan now on the bar, opening one of the boxes, taking out the ten dollar bill, putting it on the bar. then, opening another, taking out the glassine deck of heroin. then another, containing a glassine deck. he empties the glassine envelopes on the bar into a cocktail mixer which he proceeds to shake. the shaker is half filled with tomato juice. doyle leaning over the bar toward the glaring crowd, pours the mixture into the ashcan.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{milk shake anyone?}
<A>__{he wiggles his finger. it is a command for three men to step forward. the men do not move at first.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{move ass when i tell you.}
<A>__{they move, shuffling, hesitatingly. but they move two blacks and a puetro rican.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{put it on the bar.}
<A>__{hands of the three men going into pockets. close of a miscellany of keys, coins, cigarettes going onto the bar with two hypodermics, six or eight marijuana cigarettes, a small plastic vial of barbiturates.}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(collecting the works)}
<D>__{all right, you three clowns step into those phone booths, you're goin' in. go on. stand in there till i'm ready for you.}
<A>__{the three men turn and enter the individual phone booths. they stand, waiting, like contestants in the $64 question.}

<D>__{all right, that's enough, you're under arrest.}
<A>__{russo pulls the man off the bar, sends him into one of the phone booths. doyle coming down the front of the bar. he stops before another man, who has just come out of the toilet.}

<C>__{russo}
<D>__{if i see any shit on the floor, it's yours, so keep your eye on your neighbor.}
<A>__{inside the toilet of the bar. the man is up against the wall. doyle is only inches away. the man is an agent and this is the only way doyle can get immediate information from him without destroying the man's cover. their conversation is in whispers. and very fast.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{how's everything? 2nd man everything is everything.}
<C>__{doyle}

<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{where do you want it? 2nd man this side.}
<A>__{door of toilet. there is a hell of a crash and slamming behind it. door opens and doyle steps out over the crumpled prostrate form of the informer. he has just decked the man to continue the protection of the cover. he pauses halfway down the line as if he's speculating on beating up another one because he didn't get any information. but he decides that would be futile too.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{i'm goin' check on this address in the bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.}
