<L>__{exterior construction site night}
<A>__{two rats charge aisha and she leaps upward the pair smash into each other. rocky picks up a two by four and starts sparring with another rat. billy shoves a huge wooden spool down a slope and it rolls into a couple of rats, bowling them over. one rat cracks it's tail like a whip, knocking adam to the ground. another rat gets kimberly in a bear hug and she makes a face.}

<A>__{they jump into the air and they're engulfed in a dazzling golden light as we do a 3d movie version of their}
<B>__{transformation into costume.}
<A>__{they all land and there's a whirring sound as all six of the face pieces polarize so we can see their faces. the rats immediately scurry off.}

<D>__{anybody see them?}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{activating power scope!}
<A>__{a scope snaps into place over rocky's left eye. p.o.v. through power tracker we see heat sensor outlines, pulsating with color. command graphic: search mode. lines vector and scan as rocky searches the area. eventually he looks up and the lines lock on to the pulsating forms of}
<B>__{the rats.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{they're above us!!}
<A>__{the creatures leap down and we see the rangers pull off kicks, sucker punches, spinback roundhouses, you name it. one of the beasts tackles tommy and the pair go tumbling own a twenty foot rock pile. aisha picks up a handful of dirt}

<A>__{saba sees the rats.}
<C>__{saba}
<D>__{rats! i hate rats!}
<A>__{we hear a primitive cry as a beast slams into adam, sends him catapulting. adam rises, speaks in a low growl.}

<A>__{he holds his hand in the air.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{stega stinger!}

<C>__{adam}
<D>__{coming through!}
<A>__{adam leaps off a platform, swings through the air like tarzan, slams into the rat and sends him catapulting.}

<A>__{a contraption appears in kimberly's hand and she throws her arm out a long ribbon swirls out and tangles itself around the rat.}

<B>__{disappears.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{now you don't.}
<A>__{billy takes a hit, rolls across the ground. he stops inches away from a twenty foot drop off. the beast charges him, he ducks and the beast goes flying}
<B>__{through the air and splashes down in one of the muddy pools of water.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{not the brightest of beasts.}
<A>__{rocky is now up in the scaffolding. he drops ten feet through the air, lands on one end of a board. there's a beast at the other end and he goes flipping through}
<B>__{the air.}
<A>__{tommy throws saba saber and the knife swoops through the air and zings around the beasts as they try to knock him down.}
<C>__{saba}
<D>__{na na na na na!}
<A>__{the rats chase after saba as he heads into a water slicked area. there's a large power cable running across it. once all the rats are in the water, saba kamikaze dives into the cable, slicing it open with an eruption of sparks. the water sizzles with electricity and the rats go up in a puff of smoke.}
<C>__{saba}
<D>__{fried mice, anyone?}
<A>__{we see the six original small rats scurry away, squeaking. suddenly, there's an explosion of electrical activity and the rangers watch, stunned, as their costumes de materialize and they appear back in civilian clothes.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{what's going on?!}
<A>__{billy tries his wrist communicator.}
<C>__{billy}
