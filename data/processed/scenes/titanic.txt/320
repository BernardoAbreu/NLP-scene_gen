<L>__{191 a long corridor... part of the labyrinth of steerage hallways forward.}
<A>__{she is alone here. a long groan of stressing metal echoes along the hall as the ship continues to settle. she runs down the hall, unimpeded now.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{hello? somebody?! she turns a corner and runs along another corridor in a daze. the hall slopes down into water which, shimmers, reflecting the light. the margin of the water creeps toward her. a young man appears, running through the water, sending up geysers of spray. he pelts past her without slowing, his eyes crazed...}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{help me! we need help! he doesn't look back. it is like a bad dream. the hull gongs with terrifying sounds. the lights flicker and go out, leaving utter darkness. a beat. then they come back on. she finds herself hyperventilating. that one moment of blackness was the most terrifying of her life. a steward runs around the nearest corner, his arms full of lifebelts. he is upset to see someone still in his section. he grabs her forcefully by the arm, pulling her with him like a wayward child.}
<C>__{steward}
<A>__{come on, then, let's get you topside, miss, that's right.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{wait. wait! i need your help! there's }
<C>__{steward}
<A>__{no need for panic, miss. come along!}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{no, let me go! you're going the wrong way! he's not listening. and he won't let her go. she shouts in his ear, and when he turns, she punches him squarely in the nose. shocked, he lets her go and staggers back.}
<C>__{steward}
<A>__{to hell with you!}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{see you there, buster! the steward runs off, holding his bloody nose. she spits after him. just the way jack taugh: her. she turns around, sees: a glass case with a fire axe in it. she breaks the glass with a battered suitcase which is lying discarded nearby, and seizes the axe, running back the way she came.}
