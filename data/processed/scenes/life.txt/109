<A>__{a dark mood hangs over the men. jangle leg sits stoically as radio fiddles with his receiver. nearby, poker face and ray play a listless game of gin rummy. claude is thumbing distractedly through a dog eared copy of baseball digest.}
<C>__{radio}
<D>__{hey, fellas, i got chicago.}
<A>__{but nobody can muster much enthusiasm for this news. radio shrugs and drops down on his bunk. just then, can't get right walks past heading for the door. he's dressed in civilian clothes, his bindle slung over his shoulder.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{hey, can't get right, where you going? why you dressed like that?}
<A>__{can't get right holds out a piece of paper which ray scrutinizes.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's a pardon from the governor.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{let me see that.}
<A>__{the incorrigibles gather around for a glimpse at can't get right's ticket to freedom.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{where'd you get this?}
