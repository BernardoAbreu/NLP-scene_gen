<A>__{music up: the end by the doors saul gets on a bus and sits down, sad and deject. dale sits against the phone booth, crying like a baby. he buries his hands in his pocket and pulls out his baggy of weed. he hurls it away. he gets up to retrieve it. saul is in a really shitty fast food restaurant, nearly crying as he eats his burger and fries. dale stares at a joint in his hands, thinks for a moment, and then, crying profusely, lights it and starts smoking. a solitary tear rolls down his cheek and drips directly onto the tip of the joint, putting it out. dale hears the sizzle and looks at the jointerior he continues crying. he puts the joint down, beside three large roaches. walking down the street, saul sees the point grey retirement home. dale feverishly looks through the phone book. he finds what he's looking for: belogus. saul, hiding behind a bush across the street, surveys the retirement home. seeing the coast is clear, he walks towards the entrance. as saul enters the building, budlofksy and matheson pull up.}
