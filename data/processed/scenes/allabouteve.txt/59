<C>__{phoebe}
<D>__{sure, miss harrington...}
<A>__{she takes the award into the bedroom, sets it on a trunk. as she starts out, she sees eve's fabulous wrap on the bed. she listens. then, quietly, she puts on the wrap and picks up the award. slowly, she walks to a large three mirrored cheval. with grace and infinite dignity she holds the award to her, and bows again and again... as if to the applause of a multitude.}
