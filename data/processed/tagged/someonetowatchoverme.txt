<L>__{interior mike's house queens early evening}
<A>__{winter. a celebration. close friends, cop friends, family all here to celebrate patrolman mike keegan's promotion to detective, nypd. the party spills through the house front room, dining room, kitchen, with a small fenced backyard visible beyond that. a community of cops on their off hours, their wives, kids. a mix of generations, all the way from mike's kid, tommy, and his friends, playing among the adults, to an elderly woman observing quietly from her chair at the side. the mood's warm, spirited; there's a lot of friendship here. angle: mike, in the dining room, posing for a photo with his ten year old son, tommy, proudly displaying his new gold detective's shield pinned to his jersey.}

<D>__{ellie! c'mon! over here!}
<A>__{angle: ellie, mike's wife of fifteen years, a local product, bright and lively, and clearly proud as hell of her man. she frees herself from the crush of friends, hurrying to join him. angle: mike, ellie giving him a full mouthed smack on the lips as he hooks her into his arms. the picture's snapped, to a chorus of hoots and hollers. behind, a banner and poster blowup of mike in gun and uniform read: "finally they've recognized you, detective keegan." scotty, a patrolman with the 117th and one of mike's best pals, puts his hand vigorously, in congratulations, on mike's shoulder.}

<C>__{brooklyn}
<D>__{curran, that fuckin' noodlehead. he probably wrote her up for letting her dog dump on rockefeller's doorstep.}
<A>__{angle on mike, trying to swallow a mouthful of potato salad as a plump and pretty middle aged woman (helen greening) pulls him into a bear hug, planting a kiss on him.}
<C>__{helen}

<C>__{brooklyn}
<D>__{hey, am i supportive, or what?}
<A>__{angle on tommy: in the hallway, trying to show scotty's date a "real" bimbo, who's spilling out of her woolly sweater and tight jeans how to stand on his skateboard. she shrieks a laugh, toppling off. helen, passing by with an empty platter, catches the action.}

<A>__{ellie, another wife at the sink, wives all; helen enters.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he left elaine for that? wife #1 and what about little scotty?}

<D>__{i'd like to tie her tits together.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{that wouldn't be too difficult.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(overhearing)}
<D>__{i bet you think she doesn't have a brain in her head. i bet you think the only thing he sees in her is one incredible, dynamite body...}
<A>__{he grins at their blank stares... ellie's eyes wryly following... as he moves on out with his beers.}

<B>__{blinding brightness...}
<L>__{exterior club midtown night}
<A>__{a nondescript piece of rundown city block that's the hottest thing in town. personnel regulate the crowd and arrivals. there is a public line, and from it the young, hip and outrageous can look on while awaiting entrance at the formally dressed, stylishly gowned guests arriving at the private line. a glittering post metropolitan museum of art opening gala is in progress tonight. the club's private entrance looks like what it once was, a shuttered porno bookstore, and the joke's not lost on most of the formal guests, arriving through the x rated doorway.}
<L>__{interior club night}
<A>__{the latest achievement of money, rock and art. it's a breathtaking multi leveled theater of light, sound and dance. there is also an entrance by invitation only grand salon.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{the guests arriving here for the met gala enter almost in enchanted procession, each of them being personally greeted by the primary owner and manager of the club, win hockings, a charming, rakish ex preppy. win stands in the middle of the floor in the throw of a spot, greeting. this is his element and his club, a son of old money, and a crossover creature to the fast life.}
<C>__{win}
<D>__{hi... nice to see you... thank you... my pleasure...}
<C>__{a met benefactress}
<P>__{(effusively)}
<D>__{thank you so much for agreeing to host us tonight. it's really extraordinary!}
<C>__{win}
<D>__{glad i could be of help.}
<A>__{camera moving in on a new angle, claire gregory and neil steinhart. the way our camera covers them makes it clear they are major characters in our story. neil steps forward to introduce himself, but win, looking up, spots claire first: a special beauty and clearly someone very special to him...}
<C>__{win}
<D>__{claire!}
<C>__{claire}

<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(a dilemma)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. venza...}
<A>__{venza jams the accelerator to the floor, the car burning rubber like a dragster as people squeal and jump out of the way; the car fish tailing away, screeching around the}
<B>__{corner.}
<L>__{interior club night}
<A>__{win and claire. the music, noise, other conversations can still be heard as they walk through the club. he smiles, mid conversation; there's a real affection here.}

<C>__{claire}
<D>__{they've got two monsters now. both boys.}

<C>__{win}
<P>__{(to claire, quietly)}
<D>__{just press the button all the way down when you're ready, okay?}
<A>__{he turns as she's engulfed, heading towards the elevator, runs into neil, claire's escort. neil doesn't see her.}

<D>__{where's she go?}
<C>__{win}
<D>__{probably found somebody nicer... kidding. you're great.}

<A>__{venza navigates the labyrinth that connects to the offices.}
<L>__{interior basement night}

<B>__{the restaurant gallery}
<A>__{the walls have already been painted white. tables have been positioned. chairs are stacked, waiting. so are mounds of folded laundry and tablecloths, boxes of accessories, glass and dish and kitchenware, etc. except for fred, the elderly stock boy, the bright silence is empty. fred scores open the sealed cardboard cartons with a curved case cutter. several tablefuls of unloaded servers, kitchen utensils, etc., bear witness to the size of his job.}
<C>__{win}
<D>__{you're in overtime, freddy.}
<A>__{fred nods, putting down his case cutter, using a side exit. win, left alone, turns to look up proudly at his powerhouse modern art collection lining the wall.}

<A>__{claire extricating herself; to the foursome.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i will... i promise...}
<A>__{she smiles graciously and steps into the freight elevator, pushing the down button. the doors close.}
<L>__{interior basement tunnels night}

<L>__{interior freight elevator night}
<A>__{claire closes her eyes, leaning back against the metal walls, taking advantage of the refuge for the moment. music and crowd noise still vibrate. the elevator, shuddering, continues its descent.}
