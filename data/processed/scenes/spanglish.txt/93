<A>__{he speaks to her in spanish..a lavish, poetic compliment. flor, in full control, says, in spanish.."would you please just find out what she wants." evelyn joins them.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{wait till i say something before you start in..}
<P>__{(he looks at her)}

<A>__{the man translates.}
<C>__{deborah }
<P>__{(to man)}
<D>__{don't translate asides.}
<A>__{the man says in spanish to flor.."you work for her?" flor answers, "just tell her that i can't live here." deborah doesn't like that the man has initiated more conversation.}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{hispanic man}
<D>__{she can't live here. her daughter.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{okay..}

<D>__{her daughter can also live with us for the summer..}
<A>__{the man tells flor..she answers directly to deborah..}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(big decision)}
<D>__{no, sorry.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{the man asks flor who speaks in spanish..}
<C>__{hispanic man}
<D>__{i don't know. she just doesn't want to.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{will you please just tell me what she said.}
<C>__{hispanic man}
<D>__{she said, "i just don't want to."}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{if she didn't tell us about her child she has to have a deep sense of privacy. we can figure out how she can still live at home. hell, i don't mind driving her at night.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{let's spare the world you on the roads.}
<P>__{(to flor)}
<D>__{well, what do we do?}
<A>__{the hispanic man translates the last sentence. deborah and flor stare at each other..deborah's next words are somber and have enough body language to transcend the need for translation...the jig is up.}
<C>__{deborah }
<P>__{(big decision)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, my friend, this is what i need. it's just for the summer. i don't want to lose you. but ....}
<A>__{flor indicates there is no need to translate. a beat.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(enormous decision)}
<D>__{yo vivo aqui.}
<C>__{hispanic man}
<D>__{she'll live here.}
<A>__{the man says something in spanish to flor as she starts to walk away and she is thrown enough by the statement to actually stumble as she looks back at him...then, before deborah can admonish him.}
<C>__{hispanic man }
<D>__{i said, "god protect you from that boss."}
