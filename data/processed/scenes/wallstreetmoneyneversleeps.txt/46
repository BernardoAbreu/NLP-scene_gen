<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{no, that's not okay. because it means they're crowded so every tier in the service chain will be extended. the sixteen minutes we would normally wait to order will now be twenty six, the standard twenty four minutes waiting for our food to arrive will turn into thirty nine, the eight minutes to get the check will become seventeen and the four minutes to process the credit card will take nine.}
