<C>__{brendan grant}
<D>__{this is...this is insane. how do you know this?}

<D>__{you brought this man here!? you brought this man to my room!?}
<C>__{krista}
<D>__{i had to. her security people may be involved...}
<A>__{there is the sound of a toilet flushing in an adjacent bathroom. the door opens and a man emerges drying his hands on a hotel towel. he is late middle aged, white, mild looking, perhaps wearing glasses.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{is there a problem, brendan?}
<C>__{brendan grant}
<D>__{there certainly is. this man says he's been hired to kill eleanor.}

<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{who is this "they"?}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{i don't...i don't know. please, mr. grant! they have my daughter. i'm not some lunatic. your wife is in trouble. someone is trying to kill her. someone is trying to make me kill her. please, listen...}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{and on the strength of this story, you bring this man to brendan's suite? does that show good judgment, ms. brooks? i'm just a friend of brendan's, but it seems to me...}
<C>__{krista}
<D>__{he brought a gun onto the pool deck.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{krista}
<D>__{he got onto the pool deck with a gun. how did he get past her security carrying a}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{i see. where is this gun?}
<C>__{krista i}
<D>__{have it.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{well, is it real? do we know anything about it?}
<C>__{krista}
<D>__{it looks real. i don't know anything about guns.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{could i see it?}
<A>__{krista gets out the gun, wrapped in the handkerchief, hands it to him. it lays in the palm of his hand. he unwraps it awkwardly, examines it.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{my goodness. it certainly looks real.}
<A>__{he looks beyond them, towards the entrance to the suite.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{what's your opinion? you're the expert in these matters, supposedly.}
<A>__{gene turns, to see who he is talking to. angle on doorway 12:.53pm mr. smith stands by the open door. before gene can speak, mr. smith moves. it is fluid and cohtroled and fast. he marches across the room, detouring to grab a pillow from the couch. he takes the gun, shoves" it into the pillow and goes face to face with krista. she just has time to wonder what is going on there is a double muffled gunshot. shock fills her eyes, she slides to the floor. gene can only stand there, unbelieving, freaked to the gills.}
<C>__{brendan grant}
<D>__{jesus christ!}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<P>__{(calmly, staring at gene)}
<D>__{yeah, i'd say it's real.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{are you out of your fucking mind!?}
<A>__{the door opens. officer trust slides in quickly.}
<C>__{officer trust}
<D>__{somebody mind telling me...}
<P>__{(sees krista's body))}
<D>__{what the hell happened!?}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{help me get her off the rug.}
<A>__{officer trust checks the hall, shuts the door. they begin to drag her body to the bathroom. the mystery man watches.}
<C>__{brendan grant}
<D>__{what have you done to me!? christ almighty!}
<A>__{gene's eyes follow them. as if rousing from a sleep he comes to life.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{he tries to rush to the bathroom but mr. smith is right there, gripping him. gene struggles frantically, uselessly, watching the bathroom door close. mr. smith is beyond anger. he grabs gene's throat, muscles down. gene grips the iron hand that's cutting off his air.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{you fucked up.}
<C>__{mystery man }
<D>__{that's enough.}
<A>__{the mystery man grabs mr. smith's arm, tries to pry him loose. mr. smith is beyond reason.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{you want me to kill your kid!? you want me to kill you!?}
<A>__{gene's eyes begin to roll back in his head. everything begins fading to black. the blackness retreats in a rush and gene finds himself staring at the butt of mr. smith's gun, visible under his coat. he reaches for it, yanks it out, fires point blank into mr. smith, again, again. mr. smith's shocked face falls away. gene heads for the door.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{don't let him go!}
<A>__{officer trust steps between gene and the door. gene shoots him down and is out the door.}
