<L>__{65 in the corridor. douglas the attendant is tapping his stick along}
<A>__{the wall like he does every night on his rounds. he shines a little mag light in the windows of the cells as he passes, barely slowing.}
<L>__{65a he rounds the corner. his footsteps echo in the dark hallway.}
<A>__{the tip of the stick hits the wall. tap, tap, tap... getting closer to sarah's cell. he stops at the door. he is about to shine his light in when he notices that a utility closet across the hall is open. he goes to shut it, absently flicking his light into the dark closet. he notices something strange among the buckets and cleaning supplies. a mop lies on the floor, with its handle snapped off about halfway up. the other half is missing. douglas ponders this for half a second, then hears a sound behind him and spins around. the sound he heard was sarah's cell door. the missing two feet of mop handle fill his vision as it cracks viciously across the bridge of his nose.}
