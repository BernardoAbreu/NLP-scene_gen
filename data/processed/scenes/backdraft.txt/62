<A>__{everybody digs in. the table is a craze of half a dozen different conversations. on the tv mounted above on the wall are news shots of seagrave's body sticking out of the windshield. adcox stands and tinks his glass with a spoon for silence.}

<C>__{company}
<P>__{(together, a toast)}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{the klaxon suddenly rings. two bells. the ladder guys groan and get up.}
