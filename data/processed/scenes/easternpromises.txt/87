<L>__{exterior trafalgar hospital. a fire escape landing morning}
<D>__{it's cold and the wind is blowing. we see rooftops behind them. yuri is lighting nikolai's cigarette. nikolai is wearing yuri's overcoat loosely over his hospital gown. yuri lights his own cigarette and they smoke in silence for a moment.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{you got my message? yuri chuckles.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{using a dead body to file a progress report must be against fsb regulations.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{it's called improvisation.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{you've been improvising quite a lot lately. and taking risks. he glances at the cuts on nikolai's hands...}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{maybe too many. nikolai suddenly glares at yuri.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{you didn't come here to give me flowers... yuri shakes his head and prepares to deliver bad news. nikolai turns as if to go back inside. yuri grabs nikolai's arm and speaks formally....}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{in light of what has happened to you... nikolai shakes his head wearily....}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{ah, christ...}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{...and in light of other violent incidents associated with you, the russian desk at scotland yard have made an official request to the russian embassy that your undercover operation in london be terminated. nikolai doesn't react for a moment.}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{you have gone beyond what was agreed. with his cigarette dangling from his mouth nikolai begins to unbutton his overcoat..}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{in my opinion you should see this as good news. you've been in the zone far too long... nikolai turns and slowly pulls open the overcoat and the thin hospital gown beneath it. he reveals the eight pointed star tattoos on his chest and yuri reacts with absolute astonishment.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{my god...}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{if they terminate the operation now, they will be wasting this... a pause. yuri looks shocked and slightly horrified. nikolai too suddenly seems almost ashamed that he has got this far. after a long silence nikolai mumbles.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{you tell the russian desk you saw stars over my heart. ok? tell them i'm through the door. a pause. yuri is still overwhelmed.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{they are bound to ask... who did you kill? a pause.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{tell them i only killed myself. a pause. yuri is humbled. they share a moment of understanding as they smoke. finally...}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{and you can tell them i'm going to replace semyon at the head of the london organization. yuri laughs.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{what drugs are they giving you? maybe it's the anesthetic speaking.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i need you to take semyon out of the picture. i want you to arrest him. nikolai lights another cigarette from the stub of the one he is smoking. yuri is incredulous.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{arrest him for what?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{rape. yuri begins to chuckle.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{the girl was fourteen.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{and of course, she will testify...}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{she doesn't have to. she's dead. a pause.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{but she had semyon's baby. if you prove the baby is his and prove the girl was under age when the baby was conceived, that's statutory rape. a pause. yuri begins it think it through.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{all you need is the baby and some of semyon's dna. for poetic reasons i suggest you take his blood. yuri peers at nikolai with awe. a long pause. finally yuri smiles.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{you intrigue me. a pause.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{if we had never had this conversation they would have sent you home. you could have spent the spring in the mountains. riding your bicycle to your office every morning through fields of flowers. a pause.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{why stay? nikolai reacts but doesn't answer. a pause.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{you keep in touch. yuri studies nikolai.}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{and take care, mikhail. yuri tenderly takes his overcoat from nikolai's shoulders and goes back through the fire escape door. nikolai is left cold and exposed in his thin gown.}
