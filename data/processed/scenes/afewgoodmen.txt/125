<L>__{interior the courtroom day}
<A>__{kendrick's on the stand. what drives kaffee's entire examination of kendrick is this: kaffee's got him. he's gonna win. at least this round. all he has to do is not let his emotions take control of his professional skill. sam will have files and documents ready to hand kaffee as he needs them.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{lt. kendrick, in your opinion, was private santiago a good marine?}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{i'd say he was about average.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{lieutenant, you signed three fitness reports on santiago. on all three reports you indicated a rating of below average.}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{yes. private santiago was below average i didn't see the need in trampling on a man's grave.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{we appreciate that, but you're under oath now, and i think unpleasant as it may be, we'd all just as soon hear the truth.}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{i'm aware of my oath.}
<A>__{kaffee's handed some more files.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{lieutenant, these are the last three fitness reports you signed for lance corporal dawson and pfc downey. downey received three straight marks of exceptional. dawson received two marks of exceptional, but on this most recent report, dated june 9th of this year, he received a rating of below average. it's this last report that i'd like to discuss for a moment.}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{that's fine.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{lance corporal dawson's ranking after infantry training school was perfect. records indicate that over half that class has since been promoted to full corporal, while dawson has remained a lance corporal. was dawson's promotion held up because of this last fitness report.}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{i'm sure it was.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{do you recall why dawson was given such a poor grade on this report?}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{i'm sure i don't. i have many men in my charge, lieutenant, i write many fitness reports.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{do you recall an incident involving a pfc curtis barnes who'd been found stealing liquor from the officer's club?}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{did you report private barnes to the proper authorities?}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{i have two books at my bedside, lieutenant, the marine code of conduct and the king james bible. the only proper authorities i'm aware of are my commanding officer, colonel nathan r. jessep and the lord our god.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{lt. kendrick, at your request, i can have the record reflect your lack of acknowledgment of this court as a proper authority.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{objection. argumentative.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{sustained.}
<P>__{(to kaffee)}
<D>__{watch yourself, counselor.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{did you report private barnes to your superiors?}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{i remember thinking very highly of private barnes, and not wanting to see his record tarnished by a formal charge.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{you preferred it to be handled within the unit.}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{i most certainly did.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{lieutenant, do you know what a code red is?}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{yes i do.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{have you ever ordered a code red?}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{no, i have not.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{lieutenant, did you order dawson and two other men to make sure that private barnes receive no food or drink except water for a period of seven days?}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{that's a distortion of the truth. private barnes was placed on barracks restriction. he was given water and vitamin supplements, and i assure you that at no time was his health in danger.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i'm sure it was lovely for private barnes, but you did order the barracks restriction, didn't you? and you did order the denial of food.}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{wouldn't this form of discipline be considered a code red?}
<C>__{kendrick}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{not necessarily.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{if i called the other 8000 men at guantanamo bay to testify, would they consider it a code red?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{please the court, the witness can't possibly testify as to what 8000 other men would say. we object to this entire line of questioning as argumentative and irrelevant badgering of the witness.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{the government's objection is sustained, lt. kaffee, and i would remind you that you're now questioning marine officer with an impeccable service record.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{thank you judge.}
<A>__{kaffee looks over at dawson. they share a brief moment before kaffee turns back to kendrick.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{lieutenant, was dawson given a rating of below average on this last fitness report because you learned held been sneaking food to private barnes?}
<P>__{(to ross)}
<D>__{not so fast.}
<P>__{(to kendrick)}
<D>__{lieutenant?}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{corporal dawson was found to be below average because he committed a crime.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{what crime did he commit?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{lieutenant kendrick?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{dawson brought a hungry guy some food. what crime did he commit?}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{he disobeyed an order.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{and because he did, because he exercised his own set of values, because he made a decision about the welfare of a marine that was in conflict with an order of yours, he was punished, is that right?}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{corporal dawson disobeyed an order.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{yeah, but it wasn't a order, was it? after all, it's peacetime. he wasn't being asked to secure a hill... or advance on a beachhead. i mean, surely a marine of dawson's intelligence can be trusted to determine on his own, which are the really important orders, and which orders might, say, be morally questionable.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{lt. kendrick?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can he? can corporal dawson determine on his own which orders he's gonna follow?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{no, he can not.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{a lesson he learned after the curtis barnes incident, am i right?}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{i would think so.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{you know so, don't you, lieutenant.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{object!}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{sustained.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{lieutenant kendrick, one final question: if you ordered dawson to give santiago a code red...}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{ please the court }
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{i told those men not to touch santiago.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{ is it reasonable to think that he would've disobeyed you again?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{lieutenant, don't answer that.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{you don't have to, i'm through.}
<A>__{ross doesn't even wait before he says }
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{lieutenant kendrick, did you order corporal dawson and private downey to give willy santiaga code red?}
<A>__{but kendrick isn't listening he's glaring at kaffee.}
<C>__{ross}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{lt. kendrick, did you }
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{no i did not.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{thank you.}
