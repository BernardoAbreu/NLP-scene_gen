<A>__{we dolly with klute & bree as they walk in front of a row of tables. this night spot is totally black except for a series of huge slide projections on the wall in back of the tables. the slides, which change every few seconds are elegant representations of the beautiful people living the good life as seen in such magazines as vogue, town & country & harpers bazaar. the customers sitting in the darkness below provide a direct contrast to the pictures in back. the silhouette figures of bree & klute stop at a table seating three people, two call girls and a pimp. camera moves in.}
