<L>__{interior dubois mansion kitchen night}
<A>__{marian enters stealthily. a candle in one hand, a drawn dagger in the other. something leaps at her!... a cat, looking for scraps on the kitchen table. she shoos him down.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{off, nicodemus. go find mice.}
<A>__{she sighs with relief... is grabbed from behind. a masked soldier.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{we meet again.}
<A>__{he reveals a large scar on his wrist removes his mask the man who attacked her earlier. he prods her with his sword.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{drop your blade.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{you are still overmatched, soldier.}
<A>__{she drops the sword. he hurls her against the table. lays his blade against her chest.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{you owe me favors, wench. bare your breasts... or i will do it for you.}
<A>__{resignedly, she raises a hand to loosen the string on her dress. with the other hand she reaches behind her, grabs a pepper bowl. flips the contents into his face. screaming, he grabs his face. she reaches for her dagger. he slashes with his sword. she backs to the fireplace, grabs a spit of roasted chickens... drives the point clean through his chest. he stares in shock at his own blood pouring from the cooked fowls pinned to his breast... footsteps... masked soldiers converge from both sides of the house, dragging the servants. duncan is shoved through the door.}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{i am sorry, my lady. there were too many.}
<A>__{she stares at the invaders with studied calm.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{is there something you need, gentlemen? i remember no masked ball on my calendar.}
