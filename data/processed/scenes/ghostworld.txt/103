<A>__{rebecca is nervously arranging and re arranging her stuff. she puts up her gigantic new kitchen wall clock and sets the time to 12:45. she goes to the phone and calls enid. the machine picks up and rebecca hangs up. she does another tedious, pointless task. it's now 3:30. she's pissed off and goes to the phone to call again. as it rings there's a knock on the door. relieved, she hangs up and goes to answer.}
