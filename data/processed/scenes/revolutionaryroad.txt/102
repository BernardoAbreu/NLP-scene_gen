<A>__{april enters through the screen door and goes to the table. she looks down at frank's diagram and carefully places it aside. she carries the dishes to the sink and begins to wash them. suddenly, her body convulses as she tries to hold back from crying. and then there is no stopping the tears...}
<L>__{interior wheeler hallway morning.}
<A>__{april is standing by the phone, with her hand on the receiver, rehearsing. she is smoking. she dials.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{hello... milly? everything all right? my voice sounds what...?}
<A>__{april uses both hands to grip the receiver.}

<D>__{well, no, i'm afraid i'm not feeling any better... if it's not an inconvenience for you... this evening would be great. what...? oh, well no, not if they're outdoors playing. don't call them in.}
<A>__{the cigarette shreds in april's hand.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{just give them you know, give them each a kiss for me, and give them my love, and tell them you know... all right, milly. thanks.}
