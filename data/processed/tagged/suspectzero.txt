"have you seen me?" it's heartbreaking. tilt up... to take in the vast flatness of texas' i 35: concrete forever. in the distance, gray highway yields to black stormclouds gathering silently over endless prairie. a vertical vein of lightning streaks through one of them.}

"have you seen me?" he looks at the bottom of the transmissions, finds the fax number of the sender. dials it. all he hears back is the loud grainy shriek of a dedicated fax line. he eyes the faxes again. it's not alarming, but it's odd. then charlton emerges from his office, shouting:}

<A>__{granger's by the trunk. before mackelway can comment, jumbo has tossed a crowbar down from the top of the embankment: a ten pound hunk of iron, flying right at us. everybody ducks... as it clangs on the roof of the buick. jumbo shrugs.}
