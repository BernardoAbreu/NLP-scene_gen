<A>__{close shot of a headline in the wichita eagle: "eye witness to brutal murder missing" over a picture of betty. charlie is one of many customers reading a copy. wesley is plowing through a stack of pancakes.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{so how do we know that car's still in fair oaks?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we don't. but a '97 le sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?}
<A>__{charlie turns the page for emphasis and studies betty's features.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{this is bad, wesley. very, very bad.}
<A>__{wesley happily adds three strips of bacon brought by a waitress, who wears a button with the word "missing" over betty's face.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{... extremely bad.}
<A>__{wesley finally looks up, directly at the picture of betty.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{did you hear what i said?}
<A>__{wesley nods, his mouth stuffed with food.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. it's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. it's worse that we don't know where it is. and now this.}
<P>__{(points at the headline)}
<D>__{this was supposed to be my last job. i already put the deposit down on my boat.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how can you eat at a time like this? i get nauseous just watching you...}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{i can eat because i know we didn't kidnap that woman. i can eat because they aren't looking for us. and i can eat 'cause i'm fucking hungry...}
<P>__{(off charlie's look)}
<D>__{... relax. she's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i hope you're right...}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{... i know i am. let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.}
<A>__{they sit for a moment in silence. wesley swallowing without chewing and charlie studying betty's photo.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{she got out of town awfully fast. and wasn't she quiet in that house? i think most women would have screamed, don't you? i know they would've...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we could be dealing with a cunning, ruthless woman...}
