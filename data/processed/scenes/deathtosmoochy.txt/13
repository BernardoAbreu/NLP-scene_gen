<L>__{interior stokes' office day}
<A>__{stokes sits behind his mahogany desk, sipping a glass of wine as he goes over potential randolph replacements with nora bishop, his pretty protege.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{bumble bee billy?}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(reading from a list)}
<D>__{wife beater.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{square dance danny?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{still appealing the mail fraud thing.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{skippy black and the tippy trolls?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{black was deported, and the trolls... well, who gives a shit.}
<A>__{nora kicks the table in frustration.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{this is impossible. if i ever see that rainbow randolph again i will strangle him. choke the life out of him. squeeze his scrawny neck until his eyes pop out of his skull and bounce off the walls...}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{before indulging such cheery fantasies, let's just concentrate on saving my job. shall we?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{sorry, frank.}
<A>__{stokes flips through a thick stack of files. he suddenly stops at one.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{what's going on with sheldon mopes these days.}
<A>__{nora laughs.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{oh my god. have we sunk to that level already? smoochy the rhino? what a sap.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{sap's just the pill we need right now. mopes is a straight arrow. always has been.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{the guy can't get arrested, frank. he can't even break into the birthday party circuit. last i heard he was working hospitals and nursing homes. he's a joke.}
<A>__{stokes stands up and walks around the room.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{the truth of the matter is, a successful children's show has always depended on two simple elements: a fuzzy costume and a lot of hype. strip away the foam rubber and the network money and they're all jokes. marginal talents.. cabaret acts... off broadway runoff...}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i probably have ten acts in my development file acts i've been cultivating that are more deserving than sheldon mopes.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{and each one a moral question mark. something i can't risk at the moment.}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{we can do better than this guy, frank. he brings nothing to the table.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{except ethics. with mopes, there's never been a whiff of controversy. the man's an ethical, harmless, cornball. in short, a glass of milk on two legs.}
<A>__{stokes stops pacing.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{don't ask me to do it. you know i will do anything for you, but please... not this...}
<A>__{stokes gazes out the window at the city.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{go find smoochy.}
