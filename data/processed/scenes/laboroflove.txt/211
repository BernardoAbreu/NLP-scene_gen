<B>__{front door}
<A>__{maurice tentatively moving to the front door. his hand instinctively clutches his empty stomach. the wind blows gently. maurice shuts his eyes and takes a deep breath. he opens his eyes slowly to see a dinner table being set. potatoes, gravy, fresh baked bread... floating through the half open window to maurice's thankful smile.}
<B>__{the sounds of children and adults can be heard inside.}
<A>__{the first light knocks go unheard with all the commotion. harder. the door squeaks open. maurice puts on his best smile... the door opens wider no one stands before him.}
