<L>__{interior supply house day}
<A>__{dances with wolves lies unconscious on the floor of the ruined supply house. one side of his face is grotesquely swollen from the blow he took. blood still seeps from a long split of the skin along his cheek. he groans. voice are playing about his ears, the voices of white men. he opens his eyes. a bearish, bearded sergeant bauer, is squatting directly in front of him. behind the sergeant, peering over the crumbled walls like visitors at a zoo, are a crowd of ordinary soldiers.}

<D>__{spivey...}
<A>__{a pitiful looking man, spivey, who is a soldier by name only, answers up.}
<C>__{spivey}
<D>__{yessir sergeant...}
<C>__{sergeant bauer}
<D>__{tell the major he's wakin' up... and move your worthless ass.}
<A>__{the sergeant's smallish eyes are fixed on dances with wolves. with some effort he manages to get himself into a sitting position against the back wall.}
<C>__{sergeant bauer}
<D>__{got yourself a helluva shiner, didn't ya?}
<A>__{dances with wolves only blinks at him. his cheek is crushed and so is his spirit. someone calls attention and two officers walk into the roofless supply house. one is a major, one is a young lieutenant lieutenant elgin the officer dances with wolves bumped into at fort hays. neither one recognizes the other.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{does he speak english?}
<C>__{sergeant bauer}
<D>__{don't know sir... you speak english? talk english?}

<D>__{dances with wolves'}
<P>__{boots)}
<D>__{talk?}
<C>__{dances with wolves}
<D>__{i speak english...}
<A>__{everyone is shocked at the clarity of the words.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{dances with wolves}
<D>__{lieutenant john. j. dunbar. this is my post.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{why are you dressed like this?}
<C>__{dances with wolves}
<D>__{i came out from fort hays last april. but there was no one here.}
<A>__{the major and the lieutenant exchange whispers.}
<C>__{elgin}
<D>__{you have proof of that?}
<C>__{dances with wolves}
<D>__{my journal is on the bunk in my quarters. my orders are in the journal. it will tell you everything.}
<C>__{elgin}
<D>__{spivey, you and edwards were here first. did you find anything... a journal.}
<A>__{spivey shifts uncomfortably.}
<C>__{spivey}
<D>__{we didn't see nothin' sir.}
<C>__{elgin}
<D>__{where's edwards?}
<C>__{spivey}
<D>__{he's outside. but he didn't see nothin' either.}
<A>__{elgin indicates to the major that he will get to the bottom of this and walks out the door the major follows. dances with wolves lets his head slump forward. the men gathered around the supply house murmur among themselves, commenting on the prisoner. they can't take their eyes off him. neither can sergeant bauer. he watches the prisoner from a distance. then he walks across the floor, squats in front of him and whispers coarsely in his face.}
<C>__{sergeant bauer}
<D>__{you turned injun, din'cha?}
<A>__{dances with wolves lifts his head and stares at the sergeant.}
<C>__{sergeant bauer}
