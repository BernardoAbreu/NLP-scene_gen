<D>__{this is some chunk of real estate mom owns it all, i guess.}
<A>__{they are heading toward a door in the garden wall.}
<C>__{gardener}
<D>__{you can't really own something like that view over there, or that sunset, can you?}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(a believer)}
<D>__{no, of course not.}
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(to linda and marnie)}
<D>__{i can't wait to meet her.}
<C>__{gardener}
<D>__{this way, please.}
<A>__{the gardener ushers them towards a door in the garden wall. she opens it, politely stands back, letting them go through it. they turn back to look at her.}
<C>__{gardener}
<D>__{mary anne benedict never understood why people wanted to buy her paintings. but for a brief period they were considered valuable. she used the money to buy whispering pines so that young artists would have a place to work.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{she's not famous anymore?}
<C>__{gardener}
<D>__{she never wanted to be famous. she just wanted to be left alone.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{may i ask you a question?}
<P>__{(a beat, concerned)}
<D>__{why do you keep referring to her in the past tense?}
<C>__{gardener}
<D>__{because she passed away, some time ago.}
<B>__{vince and julius}
<A>__{they look like they've been kicked in the stomach.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{but but you said she was here }
<C>__{gardener}
<D>__{she is i meant her spirit. her spirit is always here.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{the gardener gently closes the door in their faces. another angle vince and julius they haven't moved. linda and marnie try to console them. julius still doesn't move. vince shakes linda off and stomps away.}
