<TRANS>__{CLOSE ON:}
<ACTION>__{The face of MINERVA "MINI" DROGUES, 18, watching something. She looks extremely bored by the television images flickering across her eyes. She has a pretty face: Large eyes, and pouty mouth. Her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly still that of a girl.}
<CHAR>__{MINI } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{I know what you're thinking. Don't bullshit me, because I do... You're thinking, oh dear lord in heaven, please, I'm begging you. I'll gouge out my eyes with the straw in my drink right now. I'll jam every last kernel of popcorn into my mouth until I suffocate, just not another fucking teenage coming-of- age story.}
<ACTION>__{We pull back to reveal her body, which is moving out of that awkward stage between adolescence and womanhood. Though tall and thin, her hips haven't quite rounded. She's wearing a "FUCT" T-shirt and jean shorts.}

<ACTION>__{CLOSE ON: THE TV SCREEN. "When Animals Attack" is on. In a series of quick cuts: A zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant. A sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a shark he and his buddies thought was dead. A pit bull clamps down on his owner's arm. An alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of a just-captured alligator, only to have it chomp down on his skull.}
