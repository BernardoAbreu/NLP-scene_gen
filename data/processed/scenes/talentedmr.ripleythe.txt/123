<C>__{maccarron}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{at a party. over some girl. he kicked the kid several times in the head. put him in the hospital. the boy had a wire fixed in his jaw. the rome police didn't think to ask mr greenleaf.}

<C>__{maccarron}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{see in america we're taught to check a fact before it becomes a fact. we're taught to nose around when a girl drowns herself, find out if that girl was pregnant, find out if dickie had an embarrassment there.}

<C>__{maccarron}
<P>__{(cont'd)}

<C>__{maccarron}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{mr greenleaf also feels there was a silent promise in dickie's letter to you which he intends to honor. he intends to transfer a good part of dickie's income from his trust into your name. he doesn't intend to give the italian police any information about dickie's past. he's rather hoping you'll feel the same.}
<A>__{there is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed.}
