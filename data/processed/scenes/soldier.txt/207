<A>__{through the scope, the gunner aims again and watches another chunk of turbine disintegrate. the gunner glances at the robot faced driver. their eyes meet. caine 607 nods. obviously, they've killed the two men. the gunner points to the cable. caine 607 follows the look, nods, and alters the course of the vehicle in toward the cable as he reaches for the radio mike.}

<D>__{oh, shit, todd...i'm...dead... aren't i? i'm not going to make it.}
