<L>__{exterior boat jacques and louis}
<A>__{jacques and louis are pumping silently. uncle louis feels obliged to answer jacques' question. uncle louis finally breaks the silence and explains:}
<C>__{uncle louis}
<D>__{your mother didn't leave. she went back to america, that's all. it's her home. she's allergic to this island. she likes refrigerators and machines that clean the floor... so one day she left. woman are like that, unpredictable, like the sea.}
<A>__{they haven't been paying attention to the bubbles gushing at the surface. the air hose is being pulled down in a very worrisome way.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(with a slight grin)}
<D>__{so where did you see mermaids?}
<A>__{uncle louis smiles.}
<C>__{uncle louis}
<D>__{in the bars in athens!}
<A>__{very pleased with himself, uncle louis burst out laughing. jacques shyly shrugs his shoulders. the air hose is suddenly yanked down. jacques immediately sees all the bubbles. he is white as a sheet. jacques rushes to the side of the boat and starts yelling down at his father. he grabs the life line and starts pulling at it hysterically. the air hose snaps and starts flying around like some crazy snake. jacques tries to jump overboard. uncle louis catches hold of his foot at the last second. jacques is slapping the water with his hands, trying to go down but uncle louis won't let him. jacques is yelling desperately. enzo is now standing on his rock, watching the scene, horrified. the sea now looks as if it were boiling. uncle louis grabs hold of jacques and hugs him in his arms. standing on his rock, enzo is now crying desperately.}

<D>__{jacques! jacques!}
<A>__{the last air bubbles are now breaking on the surface; it looks as if they will never stop.}
