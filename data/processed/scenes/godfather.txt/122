<A>__{we hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open. sonny enters, but connie has quickly moved into the hallway, her back to him.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(tenderly)}
<D>__{connie, what is it?}
<A>__{he turns her around in his arms. her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time. as soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red with rage. she sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing him from running out of the apartment.}
<C>__{connie}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{it was my fault! i started a fight with him and i tried to hit him so he hit me. he didn't even try to hit me hard sonny, i walked into it.}

<A>__{he starts to leave.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{oh sonny, please don't do anything. please don't.}
