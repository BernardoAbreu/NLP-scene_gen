<L>__{interior small restaurant day}
<A>__{max is trying to explain to the waiter what he wants.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{beef. you know cow? minced, little salt, pepper, slap it flat like this, throw it on the grill, flip it.}
<A>__{now, though, he just glimpses the shiny gas tank and engine of a motorcycle around the hip of the waiter. he leans out.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{ashoka, astride his motorcycle, gunning the engine as a boy runs out of a store with an armload of cassettes.}
<B>__{with max and waiter}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{put it on the grill, i will be right back.}
<B>__{with ashoka}
<A>__{he pulls the boy's ear, revs the engine to go... and senses someone close. he turns to find an american hovering at his shoulder.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you know, i have to say you really don't look jewish. i believe that's mine.}
<A>__{he reaches for the necklace with the hebrew letter. ashoka recognizes max. looks around for help. there is none.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{don't touch me. no one touches me.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{max grabs ashoka... who breaks free, and guns the cycle down a side street. max gives chase, his aching ribs slowing him a bit.}
<B>__{several cuts}
<A>__{ashoka, glancing back, begins to open up some distance. yet, max hangs tough, weaving like a broken field runner through the mass of bodies and vehicles. now, suddenly, he loses ashoka. he has to make a choice about this corner or that one. he chooses.}
