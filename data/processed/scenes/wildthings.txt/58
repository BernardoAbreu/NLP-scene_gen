<L>__{interior interview room later}
<A>__{gloria is grinding out the butt as ray walks back in. there is something in the way he carries himself, some sense of urgency.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(off gloria's look)}
<D>__{seen any good gator wrestling lately?}
<L>__{exterior interior detectives' car moving day}
<A>__{ray and gloria drive through the everglades, past marshlands punctuated by thick stands of melaluca trees.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{they say it was old man van ryan planted the melalucas to dry up the swamp.}
<A>__{ray nods.}
<C>__{gloria }
<D>__{you can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark. you know what you get? more bark. and more bark. there's no core. tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water. and now they can't get rid of them. they've tried poisons. nothing works. they don't die.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah, well, van ryan got his. i don't imagine he gives a shit now.}
<A>__{gloria just looks at him. ray stares into the dusty light of an approaching sunset. at last he slows, turning off the highway and onto a narrow dirt road. a sign pokes out from the tall grass "smilin' jack's fish camp." the taurus bounces along the washboard road.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{you're sure we're not lost?}
<A>__{they are driving now at the edge of a canal.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you remember that little girl walked out of our talk at blue bay?}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{the skinny brunette.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{this is where she lives. she wants to talk.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all. i busted her once for possession. she wound up doing about six months at camp nine.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{you mean camp sixty nine.}
<A>__{ray gives her a look. gloria shrugs.}
<C>__{gloria }
<D>__{that's what they called it when i was in juvenile. it's a pretty dismal place.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's a shithole. but she was dirty, what was i gonna do?}
<A>__{they pass a sagging chain link fence, entering a quarter mile run of shabby trailers and cheap shacks. the squalor of the buildings is seat in contrast to the beauty of the glades where the waters have gone to the color of polished brass beneath an immense, darkening sky. ray parks before a ramshackle building covered in vines and peeling painterior a sign reads: "night crawlers $1 a bucket." the jawbones of numerous gators hang beneath the eaves. as they get out of the car, something catches gloria's eye along the bank of the canal...}
<B>__{angle on bank}
<A>__{where a tall man (walter) with long white hair and tattooed arms kneels inside a pen, slapping a huge gator on its snout. the reptile lifts its upper body, hissing, opening its jaws. walter takes a stick from his hip pocket, passing it through the gator's mouth. the jaws snap shut, incredibly fast, with a hollow snapping sound. gloria jumps instinctively, then watches, aghast, as walter slaps the creature once more. this time moving round to the front of the gator, sticking halt his arm inside its mouth.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{he's just showin' off for you now.}
<A>__{gloria starts, then turns to find a woman (ruby) has walked up beside her. the woman is in her sixties. she's dressed in polyester. her hair is piled on top of her head too dark to be anything but a dye job. a cigarette bobs from her lips. before gloria can respond, ray steps up behind than.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{evening ruby.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i see you still got walter. i was sort of hoping something had eaten him by now.}
<C>__{ruby}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{can i help you with something?}
<A>__{ray and the old lady look at each other.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{suzie called. you know where we can find her?}
<A>__{ruby looks toward the store.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{you know the way.}
<A>__{she watches as the detectives cross the road, then calls to them as they start up the steps.}
<C>__{ruby }
<D>__{you won't shoot her will you? i don't believe she's armed.}
<A>__{gloria turns, surprised. ray gives the woman a long, cold stare, then opens the door for gloria.}
