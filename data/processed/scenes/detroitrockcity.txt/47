<D>__{before enrolling you, jeremiah, let me just say it would be greatly appreciated if your career at st. bernard's was an uneventful one. some students believe they can get expelled through disobedience and recklessness. what they don't understand is even after god's vengeance is meted out, he forgives. that his devastating anger is followed by his nurturing compassion. in a nutshell, st. bernard's may punish you even for the slightest digression, but will never cast you out, even for the largest. so here you are, jeremiah... here to stay!}
