Marcel Cerdan, a really great champ, after I beat him... he gets himself killed in that airplane crash... a pretty rotten break for him. That's why I don't like to fly. People say to me, "Look, Jake, when your time is up, your time is up." And I say, "Yeah, but suppose I'm on the plane and the pilot's time is up?" As good as Cerdan was, I could've taken him again. But I never got the chance to prove it wasn't no fluke. He got killed but he got to be what they call a legend. I don't know what's worse -- bein' a fluke or bein' a legend. -- That's the kinda luck I got. That's why I quit the ring and moved down here from New York.

Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing; The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing; My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings, if this be nothing." -- That's from something called "The Winter's Tale" -- Shakespeare! You all remember Shakespeare. He wrote all them famous plays one after the other, then he went into a big slump and he ain't done anything good in years. That speech is about jealousy -- jealousy's a bad thing. Jealousy bothers a lot of guys... take me... I almost killed my brother... I love him... he's my family... I mean, there's nothin' he wouldn't do for me. And that's the way we been goin' thru life -- doin' nothin' for each other! Anytime he got in trouble when we was kids, I got him out of it. You know, he used to steal little things when we was growin' up. But he was particular... only stole things that begin with an 'a' -- a watch, a car, a suit, a ring... But I was wrong... I shoulda never hit my brother. Afterwards, I was sorry. Now every time I need somethin' I gotta go shoppin' for it! A psychiatrist once told me, "When you hit your brother you're really hittin' your mother, but you can't admit it to yourself." He's really crazy. I woulda never hit my mother.

<DIAL>__{So there I am in the can... and not the one that says "gentlemen" on the door. I'm talkin' about jail! Down south! I mean, jail up north is gotta be like summer camp compared to jail down in cracker country. And if you're a guy like me, you ain't got a chance in a place like that. Especially if you're Italian... you come from the Bronx... and you're an ex-champ. As soon as they saw me... soon as they heard me... I know I'm in trouble. To me, they got an accent, and to them, I got an accent! You gotta get the picture -- I'm big, I got small hands, I walk like I'm still in the ring... the balls of my feet pop up and down, you know... and whenever I get the chance, I read a lot. So naturally, takin' all this into co sideration, they figure it adds up to one thing -- I'm queer! Now I didn't mind too much when they called me "Queer" or "Mr. Tough Guy" or "Yankee Punk"... But one day these screws got to me... I was workin' on the work gang, pickin' up some trees that were knocked down by a storm or somethin' and puttin' 'em on this truck. All of a sudden... one of the trees slipped and fell on me and pinned me to the ground. I'm lyin' there with a tree across my chest! This screw walks over, takin' his time, he looks down at me and says, "Well, Champ Pimp... you lyin' down on the job again?"! They got a great sense of humor when they're standin' there with a gun in their arms and you got a tree on your chest! So I look up at him and say, "Oh, this tree... it fell on me." And he says, "Oh, I'm sorry... If I'd have known, I would've yelled 'timber'" I said, "Hey, look... it hurts. I think maybe I broke somethin'!" He says, "Well, whaddaya know... Champ PImp's got himself a boo-boo." Then I got as stupid as him. I said, "If I'm Champ Pimp... how 'bout givin' me the money you made last night?"! Then another screw comes over and says, "This Yankee creep givin' you trouble?" -- What kind of trouble? What am I gonna do -- hit 'em with the tree? Now anybody else in their right mind would've said, "No sir, I wouldn't think of giving any of you gentlemen trouble... I just want to serve my time and get the hell out of here as soon as I can." That's anybody else. When I said it... it was a little different. "You stupid cracker... take your hands off me or I'll get up and kick your brains out -- but first you gotta bend over so I can find 'em!" Next thing I know I'm in the hole. Solitary confinement. All my life I had guys in my corner yellin' "Go get 'em, jake... kill 'em! You're the greatest." Now there's nobody rootin' for me. But it wasn't so bad. I learned things there. I learned how to scratch a calendar on the wall. I never knew how to do that before. Now I know. Monday is one scratch. Tuesday is two scratches. Wednesday is three scratches. And so on. Except for Sundays. Sundays is no scratches. Sundays rested.}

As WE SEE JAKE's face, the following MONTAGE images appear. (There will be contrasting sound effects accompanying the images: for example, the image of JAKE hitting VICKIE might be accompanied by the sounds from a love scene between them.) A) 1940s black and white pornography: partially clothed men and women engaged in explicit sex acts. B) Boxing magazines: fighters' beaten and bloody faces. A body building ad: Charles Atlas raises his muscled biceps. C) Li'l Abner comics; Daisy Mae's tits seem about to fall free. D) Reprise from earlier scene: Back in JAKE and IRMA's old apartment, JOEY, using a towel as a glove, punches JAKE in the face. E) A 1934 "OLDER GIRL" sashays into the candy store in flickering 8mm black and white footage. WE SEE ohter Bronx PRETEEN GIRLS walking, smiling. F) At Shorehaven pool, JAKE and JOEY, in bathing suits, are sleeping in the sun next to each other. OTHER BATHERS are around, also taking in the sun. G) Reprise from earlier scene: As in D, JOEY hits JAKE in the face again. WE SEE again the image of JAKE's face as he sits in his cell. The MONTAGE continues: H) JANIRO's face at the weigh-in. I) JAKE throws JANIRO a kiss at the weigh-in. J) JAKE punches in JANIRO's face. K) A naked GIRL stands in the doorway of a bedroom. L) JAKE lies in bed with IRMA staring at the ceiling. M) VICKIE's pretty young face DOUBLE EXPOSES with SUGAR RAY ROBINSON's. N) DR. PINTO injects novacaine into JAKE's fists. O) Sitting in his corner of the ring, JAKE spits blood into a pail... P) Still in JAKE's corner: JOEY wipes off his brother's bloody face. Q) Still in JAKE's corner: There is an open cut over JAKE's eye. JOEY, rushing against time, sucks the blood from the wound as DR. PINTO begins to examine it. R) Still in JAKE's corner: JOEY puts the mouthpiece in JAKE's mouth. (SLOW MOTION) S) JAKE wins over CERDAN. JOEY, overenthusiastic, hits JAKE on the back of the head a little too hard. JAKE gives JOEY a quick look, but JOEY just embraces him. T) On a bed, a GIRL is going down on JOEY. The GIRL turns and looks up at JAKE. It's LINDA, the waitress from his club. JAKE stares. U) JAKE's fist hits LINDA's face. V) VICKIE playfully bends JAKE's hand back, pretending to break it. W) JAKE hits LINDA again. She cries. X) Repeat image N: DR. PINTO injects novocaine into JAKE's fists. WE SEE again the image of JAKE's face as he sits in his cell. The MONTAGE continues: Y) VICKIE is in her underwear in a bedroom. A pair of black arms come in and embrace her body. Z) CLOSE UP of JAKE; he reacts to this. He's in the ring with SUGAR RAY. He knocks SUGAR RAY out of the ring. AA) VICKIE again. JAKE approaches her from behind, pulls her head back by her hair, and slaps her. BB) THE ANNOUNCER points to SUGAR RAY as the winner. (Different fight.) CAMERA PANS to RAY, victorious, his arms up. CC) A bloodied JAKE comes over to SUGAR RAY and embraces him. WE ARE BACK WITH JAKE in the cell.
