<D>__{the next morning, peppy brings breakfast into george's room and they eat it together. she laughs, talks, eats, drinks and is as vivacious as he had dreamed she would be all those years before. he looks at her with a smile on his face. then she looks at her watch and realizes she needs to hurry. title card: i've got to go. i have to be on set for nine o'clock. george smiles kindly at her. she returns the smile but we can tell that maybe reality has just reminded them that she is working, and he is not. they exchange a last glance before she leaves the room. george, now alone, gets up with some difficulty. he picks up a pile of folded clothes from an armchair. it's his jacket and pants, both half burned. on the floor, his shoes are in exactly the same state of disrepair.}
