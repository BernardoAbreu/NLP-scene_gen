<A>__{robin leaps onto tuck's cart.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{light all the barrels, tuck.}
<A>__{robin snaps the reins, steering the rumbling cart across the yard. bouncing in the back, tuck lights barrels. fuses smoke and crackle.}

<D>__{jump!}
<A>__{tuck jumps. robin steers the wagon at the gate. at the last second, he slashes the reins and leaps onto the horse's back... the barrels explode! the portcullis is blown to kingdom come. out of the smoke, robin rides the old nag like a charger. leads his cheering, ragged fighters through the open gate.}
