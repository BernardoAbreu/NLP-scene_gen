<A>__{this is where the woman was gardening, tending a rooftop flower bed. selena emerges, crushes plants as she runs to the next town house roof. gordy hits the roof behind her.}
<B>__{selena}
<A>__{as selena runs from rooftop to rooftop along the row of town houses, we see her warrior determination and discipline. she's thinking ahead and she never hesitates. her big problem is she's being pursued by an equally well trained and determined firefighter. and he's not far back. one tumble, and he'll catch her. selena strains harder.}

<A>__{vaults a gap. moments later, gordy vaults it.}
<B>__{selena}
<A>__{finally runs out of roof. she looks down. a fire escape ladder leads down to an interior, ground level courtyard of a small foreign embassy. still holding the crowbar, selena takes the ladder down.}
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{gordy reaches the ladder. selena's ahead of him by a floor, hurrying down two rungs at a time. gordy doesn't fuck with the rungs. just swings over the edge of the roof, grabs the side rails lightly with his hands, squeezes the rails with the insides of his boots and lets gravity take over.}
