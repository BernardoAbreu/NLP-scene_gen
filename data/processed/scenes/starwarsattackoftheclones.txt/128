<L>__{interior geonosis tunnel to execution arena day}
<A>__{in the gloomy tunnel, anakin and padme are tossed into an open cart. the murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. guards extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other. the driver gets up onto his seat.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{don't be afraid.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i'm not afraid to die. i've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{you love me?! i thought we decided not to fall in love. that we would be forced to live a lie. that it would destroy our lives...}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. my love for you is a puzzle, annie, for which i have no answers. i can't control it... and now i don't care. i truly, deeply love you, and before we die i want you to know.}
<A>__{padme leans toward anakin. by straining hard, it is just possible for their lips to meet. they kiss.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i have no desire to be cured of this love either. long or short, i vow to spend the rest of my life with you.}
<A>__{they kiss again. the driver cracks his whip over the orray harnessed between the shafts. the cart jerks forward. suddenly, there isa huge roar and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena}
