<L>__{exterior orphanage driveway day}
<A>__{the luxurious convertible (now parked) has drawn all the orphans to it. the handsome young officer (wally) and the beautiful young woman (candy) stand confused by the car; they are surrounded by the curious orphans, with whom they are painfully self conscious. they are overly friendly to the children as they are anxious of larch and homer and buster (in their gravedigging attire), who are getting out of the truck. nervously, wally gives the children chocolates.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{so many children. are they all orphans?}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{well, this is an orphanage.}
<A>__{the kids climb into wally's car.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{oh, they're getting into the car... watch your fingers!}
<A>__{curly tugs on candy's dress, staring up at her, his face already smeared with chocolate.}
<C>__{curly}
<D>__{i'm the best.}
<C>__{candy}
<P>__{(sweetly)}
<D>__{you are?}
<C>__{wally}
<P>__{(good with kids)}
<D>__{the best? wow! the best at what?}
<C>__{curly}
<D>__{i'm the best one.}
<A>__{curly's nose is streaming snot. candy kneels beside him and holds her handkerchief to his nose.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{here, blow...}
<A>__{curly tries to talk while she's holding his nose.}
<C>__{curly}
<D>__{i really am the best, i just have a cold.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{blow! there, i bet that feels better.}
<C>__{curly}
<P>__{(sniffs)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{the other orphans are dying with envy candy is so beautiful. (some, like buster, are torn between candy and the car.)}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{curly, come here!}
<C>__{curly}
<P>__{(to larch)}
<D>__{tell them! i'm the one.}
<A>__{virtually all the orphans have climbed into wally's car.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(to wally)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. they're not used to seeing a car like this.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{it's okay i don't mind.}
<A>__{larch, scowling, presents himself to the new couple.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{we brought some chocolates for the kids.}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(witheringly)}
<D>__{chocolates. how thoughtful.}
<A>__{larch picks up curly and carries him toward the boys' division.}
<C>__{curly}
<D>__{i'm the best! tell them!}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{you're the best, curly.}
