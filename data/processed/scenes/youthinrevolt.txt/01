<L>__{interior nick's room day}
<A>__{...sprawled on the bed, trousers around his ankles, a well thumbed issue of penthouse covers his privates.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{my last name, which i loath, is twisp.}
<A>__{nick pulls up his trousers and leaps off the bed. he pulls the drawer under his mattress out.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{the next thing you should know about me is that i am obsessed with sex.}
<A>__{a view of the drawer reveals it to be filled with neatly filed issues of penthouse and hustler. he puts the most recently utilized magazine in its place.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{lately, i have become morbidly aware of my penis.}
<A>__{nick posing in front of the mirror, pants around his ankles again. he looks at himself from various angles.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{once a remote region accessed indifferently for micturition, it has developed overnight into a gaudy las vegas of the body.}
<A>__{we pan down, and where nick's crotch is supposed to be, there is a hole in the screen leading us to...}
<B>__{las vegas of the body}
<A>__{the pulsing neon sign outside the club reads: nick's penis. we fly inside where we find a star studded floor show. drunken conventioneers make out with strippers. a leopard leaps through a burning hoop on stage.}
