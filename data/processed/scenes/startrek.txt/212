<A>__{ the strategy session continues in full swing now chekov, the youngest of the bunch, gets up the courage to chime in, incidently becoming the very first officer to say:}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{keptin kirk? excuse me, plees, could i...?}
<A>__{all eyes shift to the wonder kid who awaits permission to speak:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{yes, chekov you don't need to ask permission to }
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{based on the narada's course from vulcan, i've projected that nero will travel past saturn. if we could drop out of warp behind one of saturn's moons, say, titan, the magnetic distortion from the planet's rings will make us invisible to nero's sensors. we could follow him to earth by staying in his blind spot.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what blind spot?}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{its exhaust wake. if we adjust our shield frequencies, they shouldn't detect us.}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{wait a minute anyone understand this kid? how old are you?}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{i am seventeen, sir, how old are you?}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{we're all old enough to shave here.}
<C>__{spock }
<D>__{doctor... mr. chekov is correct.}
<A>__{everyone turns, surprised: spock has entered the bay galvanized, full of purpose }
<C>__{spock }
<D>__{i have reviewed his telemetry. if mr. sulu can maneuver us into position, i can beam aboard nero's ship.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i won't order you to do that, mr. spock.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{romulans and vulcans share a common ancestry. our cultural similarities will make it easier for me to access their ship's computer to locate the device.}
<P>__{(beat; a flicker of emotion)}
<C>__{spock }
<D>__{also, my mother was human. which makes earth the only home i have left.}
<A>__{the crew looks at this very courageous vulcan with deep respect but his focus is on uhura, whose eyes smile back at him.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{then i'm coming with you.}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(beat, considering)}
<D>__{i would cite regulation, but i know you will simply ignore it.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{see, we're getting to know each other.}
<A>__{and a moment a burgeoning friendship }
