<A>__{a113 exterior compound day (late afternoon) sarah sits at the picnic table. the weapons are cleaned and her work is done. she hasn't slept in twenty four hours and she seems to have the weight of the whole world on her shoulder. she draws her knife from its belt sheath. idly starts to carve something on the table top... the letter "n". a114 not far away, john and terminator are packing the bronco for the trip. a115 on sarah, at the table as she looks up from her carving, thinking. she watches salceda's kids playing nearby... wrestling with a mutty dog and loving it. sarah watches yolanda walking her toddler by her hands. backlit, stylized. she looks over at john. loading guns and supplies. a116 angle on kids playing. a117 sarah's head droops. she closes her eyes. a118 tight on small children playing. different ones. wider now, to reveal a playground in a park. very idyllic. a dream playground, crowded with laughing children playing on swings, slides, and a jungle gym. it could be the playground we saw melted and frozen in the post nuclear desolation of 2029. but here the grass is vibrant green and the sun is shining.}
