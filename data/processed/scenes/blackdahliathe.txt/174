<L>__{interior the warehouse building continuous}
<A>__{a huge sawdust covered roam, meathooks dangling from the ceiling. beef dangles over half the hooks. the four men look terrified. the camera finds the third man, charlie issler:}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{charlie issler was a pimp and a career confessor specializing in copping to hooker homicides. his three procuring beefs had netted him a year county jail time, his phony confessions two ninety day observation stints at the camarillo nut farm.}
<A>__{and the fourth man, paul orchard:}
<C>__{voice over }
<D>__{and finally paul orchard. jack roller, male prostitute, and a former san bernardino county deputy sheriff.}
<A>__{the group reaches a back wall of the warehouse where four}
<B>__{unused meathooks dangle over four chairs.}
<A>__{bucky studies the men's apprehensive faces as vogel stands each one on a chair with their manacled hands hooked over their respective meathooks. bucky's gaze drifts back behind a large box where he sees a sheet covered table sticking out. before his curiosity draws him over vogel addresses the prisoners.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{you all confessed to killing the dahlia. we can't prove you did, so you're gonna have to convince us... query on, bucko.}
<A>__{bucky takes a deep breath and heads first to old man bidwell. the man's palsy has him shaking and bucky grabs the meathook above him to steady him.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{tell me about betty short, pops. why'd you kill her?}
<A>__{bidwell looks at him with beseeching eyes.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{don't be timid, boyo. that bird made little boys suck his hog.}
<A>__{bucky's hand twitches on the meathook.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{come clean, pop.}
<C>__{bidwell}
<D>__{i didn't kill her mister. i just wanted a ticket to the honor farm. three hots and a cot, that's all. please, mister.}
<A>__{the man's weakened state makes his argument for him. bucky moves on to cecil durkin.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{tell me about it, cecil.}
<C>__{durkin}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{you get that line from dick tracy or gangbusters?}
<A>__{bucky catches vogel out of the corner of his eye. measuring...}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{one more time, shitbird. tell me about you and betty short.}
<C>__{durkin}
<D>__{i fucked betty short and i fucked your mama! i'm your fucking daddy!}
<A>__{bucky one two's him in the solar plexus. his legs buckle, but he keeps his feet on the chair.}
<C>__{durkin }
<D>__{you think you clever, don't you. you the bad guy, your buddy the nice guy. older than vaudeville.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{i'm the nice guy, cecil. keep that in mind.}
<A>__{this shuts durkin up. bucky moves to charlie issler.}
<C>__{issler}
<P>__{(sincere)}
<D>__{please. i didn't kill liz. i don't know why i do these things, and i apologize. so please don't let that man hurt me.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{convince me.}
<C>__{issler}
<D>__{i...can't. i just can't.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{you're a pimp. you know betty short?}
<C>__{issler}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{why'd you confess to her murder?}
<C>__{issler}
<D>__{she looked so...sweet and pretty and i felt so bad. i always confess to the pretty ones.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{you feel guilty charlie? you hit your girls, get 'em high on hop?}
<C>__{issler}
<D>__{i do such nasty things i don't know why }
<A>__{vogel struts over, putting on brass knuckles.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{this kid glove routine's gettin' old }
<A>__{he kicks issler's chair out from under him, the pimp screaming as his wrists snap. vogel kicks the remaining three chairs out, punctuating each with a declaration:}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{jack roller! nigger! baby fucker!}
<A>__{the men scream like dying animals as fritzie zeroes in on charlie issler. he begins punching him in the gut with the brass knuckles.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{tell me about the dahlia's missing days you whoremonger! tell me!}
<C>__{issler}
<D>__{i...don't...know...anything!}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{tell me what you know!}
<A>__{he punches him in the crotch.}
<C>__{issler}
<D>__{i knew you at ad vice!}
<A>__{vogel ignores him, rabbit punching him, cracking one rib and then another on bucky's face knowing this is getting out of control. he's mesmerized by a fire alarm on the wall behind the men...}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{tell me what your girls tell you!}
<A>__{issler retches, coughing up blood. bucky stares at the fire alarm as fritz runs through his field of vision, cackling. bucky refocuses on the scene as fritzie returns, wheeling the sheet covered table bucky'd seen before. he whips off the sheet revealing: a naked female corpse, cut in two and made up to look like:}
<B>__{the dahlia.}
<A>__{vogel grabs issler by the scruff of the neck and jerks him down off of the meathook.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{for your cutting pleasure, jane doe number forty three. you're all going to slice her, and the best slicer buys the ticket!}
<A>__{issler bites through his lip as fritzie pulls out a switchblade and pops it open. bucky takes in the nightmare scene all in slow motion, the men with their broken wrists, the pudgy naked corpse, fritzie with the knife... he runs for the fire alarm and pulls the lever, a piercing bell ringing out as bucky runs out of the warehouse and jumps into the drunk wagon, tearing off into the night.}
