<L>__{exterior moebius apartment, street night}
<A>__{danny comes out of the building, squats between two parked cars and vomits, retching spastically until, gasping for breath...}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{here...}
<A>__{he turns. carla walks over to him, wipes his mouth with a crumpled tissue. when she moves to kiss him, he holds back, shy about the smell, but she kisses him anyway, on the mouth.}
<L>__{interior danny's apartment night}
<A>__{carla, naked, browsing the books, sees something in the closet. it's the torah danny took from the synagogue. she unrolls it on the bed, her gaze moving over the mysterious, glossy script. danny, coming out of the bathroom, sees what she is doing, and stops short.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{where'd you get this?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i stole it. from a synagogue.}
<A>__{she looks at the broad printed columns....}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{how come there's no punctuation?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{that was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... anyway, the jews know where the sentences end. they know the whole thing by heart. every word. every letter.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{do you know it like that? by heart.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{but you can read it, the hebrew.... right?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what do you care?}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{'cause i want to know.... what is this word? this one here...}
<A>__{danny looks at the word, then back at her. he's torn between competing desires, but finally...}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{va yomer... and he said.}
<P>__{(she moves her finger to the left)}
<D>__{it goes the other way.}
<C>__{carla}
<P>__{(she knew that)}
<D>__{oh, yeah...}
<P>__{(moves finger right)}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{va yomer adonai el avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo mimohlad tcha oo m'bayt avaycha el ha ertez asher arecha...}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{what's it mean?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{and god said to avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land a different land and i will show you....}
<A>__{danny remains silent a moment, affected by the passage....}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{i want to learn to read it.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{know your enemy.... 'cause it's a basic text of western culture. i want to read it in the original. okay?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{hebrew's very difficult. it would take years.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{i'm good at languages.}
<A>__{he looks at the smooth expanse of her back, the articulations of her spine. he finds her very beautiful.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{put something on. you're not supposed to be naked in front of it.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{they think it's the word of god, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{that's stupid.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yeah, it's stupid.}
<P>__{(indicating her t shirt)}
<D>__{put it on, or i won't teach you.}
<A>__{she grudgingly pulls on the shirt as he gets a pencil and paper.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{see, the jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the sabbath from the week, the jew from the gentile.... as if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{what assholes.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you can't curse in front of it either.}
<A>__{he shrugs as if indifferent to these rules, yet compelled to point them out.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{who gets contaminated, the jews or the gentiles?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{good question. both.}
<P>__{(draws a letter)}
<D>__{aleph...}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{it looks a little like a swastika.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{it's silent. it holds a place, takes a vowel. the vowels are little dots that go under the letters.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{where are they?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{they don't put them in the torah. i will get you a chumash, they'll have them there...bet...gimel...dalid...hay...}
<P>__{(as she repeats the names)}
<D>__{how come you're here instead of with curtis? besides the hebrew lessons...}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{the sex is better.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{even though his dick is so big?}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{with you there's a tragic dimension.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{vuv...zayin...chet...tet...}
<A>__{he writes each letter as he says it, and she repeats after him.}
