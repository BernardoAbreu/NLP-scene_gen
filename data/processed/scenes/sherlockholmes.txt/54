<A>__{the beggar is up, limping toward the window where moriarty and irene sit. he has disgusting blackened teeth.}
<C>__{beggar}
<D>__{a little charity would go a long way, yes it would, sir.}
<A>__{he reaches toward the window. within a nanosecond, moriarty extends his hand into which a pistol appears, delivered by a concealed mechanism (travis bickle style). the gun rests on the beggar's forehead. the cold eyes of the man that holds the weapon bore into the skull of the beggar, who backs off in fear. the carriage moves on.}
