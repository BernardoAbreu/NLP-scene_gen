<A>__{luther, walking down the third floor corridor. the corridor walls. no paintings here instead we see a series of framed photographs. the first is of a baby girl, the next one of the same child at three. we watch the child grow up in these photos. at ten she is already pretty. at fifteen a stunner. not a classic beauty by any means, she is turning into, if you will a latter day ann margret. the kind of girl you ached for in high school. the perfect cheerleader. these are pictures, we will come to know, of christy sullivan. a high school graduation shot at eighteen, a shot in front of a burger king at twenty. closeup wedding photograph christy, looking just fabulous, is 24 and smiling happily. we can only see her face and the wedding veil here. now pull back to reveal a glorious and expensive white wedding dress. christy holds a bouquet of flowers. breathtaking.}
