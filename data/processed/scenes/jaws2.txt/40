<A>__{sitting snug and ship shape on mike's green machine are mike, andy, brooke, and jackie. they are heeled over in a brisk wind, making good headway; sailing nearby in the b.g. are patrick and lucy and donny and denise, in their boats.}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(from her boat)}
<D>__{where're we going?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{oh, out a ways. maybe the lighthouse.}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{the lighthouse?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{no big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{we got some stuff at the store. ed and tina are going to be there.}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{oh, sure, they would be.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what's the lighthouse?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{it's an island, near here, with a lighthouse. we sometimes hang out there, you know...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{great. i got some wine.}
<A>__{she opens her big floppy bag, revealing the top half of a jug of mountain red. brooke slides over to her.}
<B>__{angle on brooke and jackie}
<C>__{brooke}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{the lighthouse is a make out spot.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{now i really want to see it.}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{you going to fool around with mike?}
<P>__{(jackie shrugs)}
<D>__{well, i'm not doing anything with him.}
<A>__{she indicates andy, who pretends great indifference.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{well, maybe i will, then.}
<A>__{andy does about a triple take before he regains his cool. mike concentrates on his sailing, jackie grins an impish, vixen grin, brooke shrugs.}
