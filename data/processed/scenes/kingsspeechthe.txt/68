<L>__{interior playroom, york house night}
<A>__{winston churchill is incongruously inspecting a rocking horse. unable to resist, he sits on it gingerly, rocking back and forth lost in a reverie. eyes closed he extends his right arm as though holding a cavalry saber. bertie enters startling him.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{don't dismount.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{good of you to see me at this late hour.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{thought you were in david's camp?}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{i was.}
<P>__{(takes a piece of paper}
<D>__{from his pocket and}
<P>__{reads)}
<D>__{"i am now free to tell you how i was jockeyed out of the throne."}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{good lord! my brother wrote that?}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{wallis wrote it for him. i will burn it. i fear your brother is like the child in a fairy story, given everything in the world, but they forgot his soul. quite happy to bring his nation to the brink of civil war just as we face global conflict.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{we're not coming to that?!}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{oh, there'll be war, alright.}
<P>__{(takes out another piece of paper)}
<D>__{your brother held conversations with the duke of saxe coburg, your cousin, a ranking member of the nazi party. i have the scotland yard intercept: "who is king here? baldwin or i? i myself wish to talk with hitler, and will do so here or in germany." i doubt england is ready to return to absolute monarchy.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{surely his motives are misunderstood?}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{"if i don't get my way, when the war comes, hitler will crush everyone, including the americans. the british may not want me as their king, but i will soon be back as their leader." his intent seems crystal clear.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{winston?! don't take him seriously!}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{mugs for his cancelled coronation will soon be on clearance sale.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{you're willing to go along with this?! changing horses in mid stream is a perilous maneuver!!!}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{depends how badly the horse you're on stumbles.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{it's not too late, winston, you could form a government on his behalf.}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{i must decline. reluctantly.}
<A>__{the rocking horse cracks. churchill gets to his feet.}
<C>__{winston churchill }
<D>__{sorry.}
<P>__{(starts to exit, then)}
<D>__{i've written a new speech for him.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i don't want to hear it! ever!}
<C>__{winston churchill}
<D>__{it does have a rather nice turn of phrase.}
