<A>__{carlotta hurriedly finishes tucking herself in while sheeni brushes in the bathroom. carlotta hastily switches out the light. sheeni emerges in a few small scraps of flimsy black lace.}
<D>__{nick carlotta goodness. what an attractive negligee.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{do you like it? i bought it in santa rosa last fall. i had hoped to wear it for nick. nick carlotta oh, darling, i'm sure he would have found it most... appealing.}
<A>__{sheeni crawls into bed. she cuddles close.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{i like lying here with you, carlotta. nick carlotta you do?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{i can't think of anyone i'd rather lie here with.}
<A>__{carlotta furrows her brow.}
<C>__{sheeni}

<D>__{sheeni! you knew!}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{of course, nick. did you really expect to fool your soul mate with such a disguise?}
<A>__{nick swoons, grasping her gauze glazed nakedness.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{take me darling!}
<A>__{and as they engage in a feverish kiss, rousing hymns surge. the church chorus' joyful song rings hallelujah. the two lovers are entwined before an abstract red}
<B>__{background. las vegas of the body}
<A>__{into the nick's penis nightclub where champagne bottles pop with the ringing in of a new era, and the leopards roar, and the stage erupts with fireworks.}
