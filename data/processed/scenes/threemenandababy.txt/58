<C>__{peter}
<D>__{was this package delivered to you?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yeah, why?}
<A>__{peter raises his voice, exasperated by michael's calm attitude.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{when the hell did this package arrive?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{will you quit shouting!}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(screaming even louder)}
<D>__{when did this fucking package fucking arrive, michael?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i don't know... oh yeah, sunday mrs. razzolini brought it up...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{holy shit!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{this is the package those guys came for, not the baby, you asshole.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hey, asshole yourself!... oh shit!}
<A>__{peter nods and begins to bark orders.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{look out the window and see if you see them, i'm gonna try to catch up with them...}
<A>__{michael runs to the window. peter runs like a madman through the apartment out the front door. he presses the button for the elevator. it's in use.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{goddamit!}
<A>__{he opens the door leading to the stairs and races down them, holding on to the bannister. he flies, overwhelmed by anxiety. suddenly he trips, loses his balance and makes a spectacular crash landing. the package gets a bit crushed, and little individual packets of white powder spill out of it. peter stares at them in horror.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what the hell is this?}
<A>__{he picks up a few packets and examines them.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh, god, no... dope! that's all we need!}
<A>__{he starts to tremble with fear. he picks the packets up as fast as he can and hastily puts them back into what's left of the package; then shoves it all into his pocket and continues racing down the stairs.}
