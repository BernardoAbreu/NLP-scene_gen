<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{on the stairwell, burnham, stops, frozen, his face twitching with indecision. he hears the murder taking place just above him. he runs down three steps. stops again. runs down the rest of the stairs.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{raoul stretches to push the red "close" button for the door, but he has to hold meg's head down, out of the lower beam with one hand, all with sarah savagely attacking him at the same time, and three syringes hanging out of his neck. finally, he gets meg's head all the way down, onto the floor. looking up, meg sees the red beam become complete again. raoul jabs the button just as sarah throws her hand into the upper beam, the one at shoulder level. sarah's hand turns red, the beam is broken, the door will not close. raoul roars in anger and twists violently, sending sarah flying across the room. meg strains, gets her head off the floor again, breaking the beam. raoul starts jamming the close button, over and over again, the beam completes, then breaks, completes, then breaks, never the button and the beam at the same time. but it can't go on forever. meg's tiring, she can't keep it up, her head trembles and collapses onto the floor. the beam completes raoul smacks the red button and burnham appears on the other side of the door. he reaches in, grabs hold of raoul, to pull him off her, but raoul loses his balance, falls forward into the gap and his head is crushed by the spring loaded steel door that slams forward just as meg draws herself back. meg falls across the panic room, grabs sarah, and holds on tight. the door detects the obstruction and opens again, slowly. raoul's body slumps to the floor, dead. burnham stands there, looking down at meg and sarah. they stare at each other, wordless, their first face to face contact. she sees the bonds protruding from his jacket. she just looks at him. there will be no understanding here. he zips his jacket, turns, and hurries away.}
