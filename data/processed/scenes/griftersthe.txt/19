<L>__{interior second bar day}
<A>__{another crowded lunchtime bar. a big beefy bartender moves quickly, carrying a draft beer. an angle on roy, in position, finger holding bill down, as the bartender arrives, puts down the beer, reaches for the bill, stops, stares at the bill. two shot, the bartender and roy, as the bartender gives roy a very cold look. he knows, and roy knows he knows. roy tries an innocent smile, which doesn't work. roy moves. cu, the ten dollar bill, as roy grabs it, but the bartender simultaneously grabs roy's wrist. an angle on roy and the bartender as roy tries to pull away and the bartender holds him with his left hand while reaching under the bar with his right. he comes up with a sawed off baseball bat. roy, seeing it, throws his free arm up to protect his head, but the bartender pushes the blunt end of the bat straight across the bar at a downward angle and hard into roy's solar plexus, driving the air out of him and propelling him back away from the bar, leaving the ten. the nearest customers on both sides become aware that something happened, but nothing follows and they're already involved in conversations. the bartender scoops up the ten as he puts the bat away under the bar. an angle on roy, arms folded across his torso, staring in shock toward the bar, where the space he filled has already been closed in by other bodies. nearly retching, he stumbles toward the door.}
