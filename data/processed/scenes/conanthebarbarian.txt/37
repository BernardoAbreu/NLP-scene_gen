<L>__{exterior desert sandstorm day}
<A>__{khalar singh looks older. worn. he squints as he stares into a howling sandstorm. ukafa trudges through the deep sand to reach him. the sandstorm is so blinding we don't see him until he is less than five feet away.}
<C>__{ukafa}
<D>__{khalar singh, we've lost half our cavalry legion, and still fariq presses on! we must turn back!}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{he says the queen is here.}
<C>__{ukafa}
<D>__{he leads us in circles. he knows nothing of leading an army }
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{take care, ukafa. you hold a special place in my kingdom, but blood you are not.}
<C>__{ukafa}
<D>__{my apologies, khalar singh. i am simply concerned for your army.}
<C>__{khalar singh}
<D>__{and i would gladly sacrifice every last man to get my hands on the queen. and in that respect, fariq has my confidence. he knows more of the legends of acheron than anyone.}
<A>__{suddenly, two forms race at them from the blinding sand. remo and fariq. no longer a child, fariq is now a man in his twenties, but he is hardly the strong warrior his father is. his frame is slight, his eyes beady.}
<C>__{fariq}
<D>__{father, they are here! the hidden oasis, just as it was written.}
<A>__{khalar singh looks to remo for confirmation. the misshapen and shadowy remo nods.}
