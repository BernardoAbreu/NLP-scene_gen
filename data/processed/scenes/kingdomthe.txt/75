<L>__{exterior al rahmah moments later}
<A>__{hands in pockets. soak in the aftermath: shallow but wide crater, shredded backstop, nearby buildings torn, blood baked into dirt. fifteen cars.}
<P>__{colonel al ghazi (o.c.)}
<D>__{the remaining rules: you cannot touch evidence, question anyone without me present, touch muslim dead, or leave my sight at anytime: your safety is my primary concern.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{i would have thought your primary concern was investigating a crime. colonel al ghazi and you would be mistaken.}
<A>__{sykes looks over to fleury. crooked smile.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(to fleury)}
<D>__{i think it's one of those "something happens to us... his head comes off" kind of deals.}
<P>__{(to al ghazi)}
<D>__{is it one of those kind of deals, colonel?}
<A>__{al ghazi ignores sykes.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{so, if you're not running the investigation...who is?}
<A>__{al ghazi motions to 50 men in uniforms different than his: sang troops digging, bagging evidence, marking the scene with red flags.}
<D>__{colonel al ghazi the national guard's military police brigade is conducting the investigation. my orders begin and end with your health.}
<A>__{the team: so we're on tour. fleury still silent.}
<C>__{adam leavitt}
<D>__{i thought the sang were soldiers colonel al ghazi the bombers didn't wear a soldier's uniform. they wore mine.}
<A>__{fleury finally speaks, asking the most important question:}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{who is in charge of the investigation then?}
<A>__{al ghazi points to a man we've seen before, general abdul malik. haytham's interrogator. he pours over a table 20 feet away: maps, blueprints, utility schematics spread before him.}
<D>__{colonel al ghazi general abdul malik. he's given us permission to walk through each crime scene.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{to walk through? are you kidding me? colonel al ghazi i am not.}
<A>__{starting to get heated.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{get him over here now and let's clarify this situation. colonel al ghazi there is no lack of clarification.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{there sure as hell is! i don't know what kind of game you're playing but you got the wrong guy, colonel al ghazi! that was not the deal colonel al ghazi}
<P>__{(getting hot)}
<D>__{this is not a game show, mr. fleury! there are no deals made here. there is me telling you what you may or may not do and there is you doing it.}
<A>__{beat. as al ghazi stabilizes...}
<P>__{colonel al ghazi (cont'd)}
<D>__{you will be permitted to walk through the crime scenes. when we have determined that it is safe.}
<A>__{a stand off. fleury eyes al ghazi. trying to figure this guy out. sees something that looks like a flash of embarrassment in al ghazi's eyes: unable to perform his profession, relegated to tour guide. leavitt begins taking notes. haytham sees his notebook, snaps his fingers at al ghazi who looks, nods: let him.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{fleury tight grins. looks off. in one of the apartments, he sees a person looking down at them from behind a curtain. he tries a new tactic.}
<C>__{ronald fleury }
<D>__{how have you guys been doing with the witnesses? al ghazi what witnesses?}
<A>__{al ghazi just stares at fleury.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{i'm guessing there are a bunch of americans, brits... australians? someone must have seen something. i'm sure they're just dying to talk to you guys, seeing as how the killers were wearing your uniforms. that must be a real confidence booster for them.}
<A>__{al ghazi silent, staring.}
<C>__{fleury }
<D>__{let me talk to them.}
<A>__{al ghazi looks unsure. he was not expecting this.}
