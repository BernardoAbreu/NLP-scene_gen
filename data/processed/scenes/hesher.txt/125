<A>__{tj roams the stacks, looking for his mother's car. he looks distraught. all around sit stacks of wrecked cars. a vicious dog on a chain barks and snarls nearby. tj stops. he sees his mom's car atop a tall stack of wrecks. he looks at it a moment, contemplating what to do. he moves to the base of the stack and begins to climb. he clambers slowly up the pile in the rain. it's awkward and difficult and more than a little dangerous. finally he reaches the top. he wrenches open the car door and squeezes behind the wheel.}
