<L>__{exterior cyberspace x net optik highway over dark zone}
<A>__{compiler crews work at megahertz speed. optik highways extend and converge. switching stations assemble. crews shift to new assignments. pull wide to see dismal ground below. dark zone, emitting woeful blips of random energy. pillars descend from x net crews above and smash into the old silicon, planting themselves deep and impervious. rush stands on a vista point, aghast as x net construction dominates the landscape.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{it's a bummer being on the losing team, huh rush?}
<A>__{flynn sits nearby, trying to patch his corrupted leg.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{we'll trash x net. then we'll go back to the our world and expose what sinclair's done.}
<A>__{he looks at krod, boole, quantz and code monkeys in the distance, preparing for battle.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{do they have any idea our world exists? do they understand what a user is?}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{programs once connected freely with their users. but plexor shut down the i o ports, severing all links. he controls all contact with the world we once knew. programs operate on his instructions or none at all.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{or yours.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{it's nothing to brag about. we're getting our butts kicked.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{it there a way to contact meg? she can transport us back to our world. maybe it's better if we fight sinclair on his own turf.}
<A>__{flynn lays a somber gaze on his eager fighters.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{i gave up the idea of going back a long time ago... you should too.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{sinclair didn't get where he is by being dumb. even if we survive plexor's forces in here, sinclair will make sure we never get back home.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{but... meg said }
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{i'm sure she'll do everything she can. it might not be enough.}
<A>__{flynn removes a cover plate from his leg, trying to hide the damage from rush. suspicious, rush pulls the plate aside.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{oh, man.}
<A>__{flynn's data corruption has worsened. his leg throbs with the drab glow of irreversible memory drain.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{why didn't you tell anyone it was this bad?}
<A>__{flynn looks at his leg. then at rush.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{rush. i think meg suspects the truth about sinclair.}
<C>__{flynn }
<D>__{that's why she sent you here. she knew you're the one guy who could find out.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{i thought she hated me.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{she believed in you more than you believed in yourself.}
<A>__{it sinks in. wow.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{do we really have a shot at winning against plexor?}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{we have his master key. and we have mega working on the inside.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{mega... are you sure about her? i get the feeling she plays both sides.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{plexor programmed her to perform his will. he's a control freak. i'm not. i programmed her to have a will of her own. whatever she decides, it's up to her.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{sounds dangerous.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{sometimes you've got to trust the bigger plan.}
<A>__{krod and fighters approach.}
<C>__{code monk j2r}
<D>__{ready to rock and roll.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{guys... rush is right about our final attack. if we've only got one shot, we should go for plexor's central server. if we insert the hologon key in the main power supply, we can trigger a meltdown. plexor will be have his best troops standing in our way.}
<C>__{flynn }
<D>__{getting past them was the ultimate task i programmed tron to carry out.}
<A>__{he takes up tron's dark disk.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{i turbo charged him to burn hot and burn fast. who else could handle the operating code in this disk?}
<A>__{he extends the disk to rush.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{you.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{uhhh, i don't think so.}
<C>__{boole}
<D>__{it could mean the difference between winning and losing.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{hey, i will try.}
<A>__{rush holds off krod, takes the disk.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{what do i do ?}
<A>__{waves of rush's data energy surge into disk circuitry.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{yow!}
<A>__{he buckles and shakes. hands zapping. knees trembling.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{steady. it's all about giving as much as you get. let it become a part of you.}
<A>__{rush clenches teeth, concentrates. grips the disk. energy surges back and forth, up rush's arms, around the disk. he holds tight, ready to scream }
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{awesome, dude! don't let go!}
<A>__{fighters are amazed, as tron's disk powers up and rush's body circuits dazzle in the ruby circuitry patterns of tron.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{he did it!}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{damn, look at that... he did it.}
<A>__{rush looks at his arms, astounded. his circuitry strobes in hues of brilliant red. disk animates and unfolds, revealing infinite surface variations. rush feels new power surging inside his body. his eyes harden, keen like tron's. rush leaps backward, goes airborne, lands on a ledge high above. amazing balance.}
<D>__{krod & fighters yes! excellent move, dude!}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{it feels... awesome.}
<A>__{rush's voice is a little deeper, with a digital edge. it surprises him. he cocks his disk and throws. disk rockets across the landscape, a mile away and strikes an x net survey post, blasting it to bits. disk arcs high, shoots back toward rush. rush looks worried for a second, ready to duck }
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{don't flinch, rush! it's your disk now.}
<A>__{disk snaps back into rush's hand, painlessly. throbbing with energy.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{oh man, this is good.}
<A>__{rush pulls a new light wand from a thigh bracket. it extends into a hundred foot vaulting pole. rush vaults across the canyon, lands with precision. light pole retracts into the wand in a nanosecond.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{awwwww! where can i get one of those?}
<A>__{another two vaults and a leap rush tosses his disk into a spiral, steps off it mid air (like stairs), and lands perfectly rejoining the group. cheers from krod, quantz, boole and code monkeys. flynn shakes rush's hand energy surges between them.}
<C>__{boole}
<D>__{it's for real, quantz.}
<C>__{quantz}
<D>__{we've got a chance to take down plexor.}
