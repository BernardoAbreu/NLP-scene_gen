<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{carl goes into the kitchen.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(up, to carl)}
<D>__{just put everything right in the oven carl. on "low."}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{yes ma'am.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(enthusiastically)}
<D>__{let's open the wine now. it's a montrachet.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(appreciatively)}
<D>__{a big glassful.}
<A>__{she moves to a small bar set in the wall cabinet. produces two glasses, hold them up.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{big enough?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{fine. corkscrew's on the right.}
<A>__{she finds it. puts the glasses on the table, uncovers the wine, and begins screwing in the corkscrew.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. and the last week must be the hardest.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{yeah i want to get this thing off and get moving.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(struggling with cork)}
<D>__{well, i'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.}
<A>__{carl comes out of the kitchen carrying the empty warming oven. he sets it down he sees lisa struggling with the corkscrew.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{let me, madam.}
<A>__{she does. he takes out his own professional corkscrew, quickly inserts it and levers the cork out. he deftly wraps the napkin around the bottle and pours the wine, replacing the bottle in the wine bucket. lisa has opened her purse to produce some money, in bills. she hands it to the waiter.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{this will take care of the taxi as well.}
<A>__{carl, without looking at the money, puts it in his pocket.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{thank you, miss fremont.}
<A>__{he picks up the warning oven.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{have a pleasant dinner, mr. jefferies.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{carl goes up the stairs and out the door, while the camera remains on lisa and jeff. she picks up both glasses of wine and walks toward jeff. she seats herself on the windowsill as she hands him his glass. we notice that the outside is considerably darker by now, and the lights are beginning to come on in the various apartments outside. they raise their glasses in a silent toast, and sip the wine. the camera closes in until they are both in a tight tow shot.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{what a day i've had!}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{tired?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{not a bit. i was all morning in a sales meeting. then over to the waldorf for a quick drink with madame dufresne just over from paris. with some spy reports. back to the "21" for lunch with the harper's bazaar people that's when i ordered dinner. then two fall showings twenty blocks apart. then i had to have a cocktail with leland and slim hayward we're trying to get his next show.}
<P>__{(softly, looking up to him)}
<D>__{then i had to dash back and change.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(mock seriousness one girl to another)}
<D>__{tell me what was slim hayward wearing?}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{she looked very cool. she had on a mint green }
<A>__{she breaks off with a little laugh, and a slight reproachful look at jeff. she sips her drink then says:}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{and to think, i planted three nice items about you in the columns today.}
<A>__{jeff's opinion of that is a short chuckle.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you can't buy that kind of publicity.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{that's good news.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{someday you might want to open up your own studio here.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{how could i run it from say pakistan?}
<A>__{she puts down her glass and slides along the window seat nearer to him, the camera closing in. she looks up at him with a serious frankness.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{jeff isn't it time you came home? you could pick your assignment.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i wish there was one i wanted.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{make the one you want.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(as if he can't believe her)}
<D>__{you mean leave the magazine?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{for yourself and me.}
<P>__{(she adds eagerly)}
<D>__{i could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits }
<A>__{jeff interrupts her with soft laughter.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(offended)}
<D>__{don't laugh. i could do it!}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{that's what i'm afraid of.}
<P>__{(he gazes into space)}
<D>__{could you see me driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep wearing combat boots and a three day beard?}
<P>__{(he chuckles at the thought)}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(looking directly at her)}
<D>__{let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?}
<A>__{she stands up. the camera pulls back.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i'd better start setting up for dinner.}
<A>__{she moves away behind him, into the kitchen.}
