<D>__{and then the ninja army unleashed a giant fireball that brought the robot dinosaur to its knees, saving mars, earth and the nude amazonian alien women all in one sweeping motion. the earth was saved. jebediah and aleena were allowed to marry by alien king xardon. it was to be the first human nude amazonian alien woman wedding, and no expenses would be spared. all of babylon and mars were invited to join in the celebrations.}

<D>__{the moment the bride and groom kissed, king xardon performed a mind wipe on all of the humans, thereby erasing all knowledge of these events from their minds, and sent them back to babylon. for seven hundred years these events would be forgotten by mankind until one day, a great writer by the name of mark bellison, would stumble upon them in the desert, after being fired by his shit boss anthony and mocked by rob and shelly, two huge douche bags. lecture films motion picture studios would go on to make the picture and it would be a big success, and mark would become very wealthy and famous from it. the end.}
