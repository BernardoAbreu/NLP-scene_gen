<A>__{whip's been awake for hours as he sits at the foot of the bed. whip's wearing a long sleeve tee shirt and sweat pants and no shoes. he looks at nicole sleeping angelically on her side of the bed. whip watches her sleep for a long moment, until... he hears something. he gets up and goes to the window. it's a car pulling up the driveway.}
