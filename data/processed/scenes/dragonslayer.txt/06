<A>__{conjuring room day galen sits alone amidst the museum like collection of magical apparatus. he stares at the amulet, considering its significance. his reverie is interrupted by the murmur of voices below. at the window he looks down to see hodge bidding farewell to the delegation from urland. valerian is the last to leave. he pauses at the gate and glances up at galen. then he moves on. the young student of magic sets his jaw, suddenly filled with resolve. moving through the room, he busies himself with the old man's effects. he scoops up the loose books and parchments and locks them into trunks. he drapes muslin cloths over the alchemical devices. he sows a handful of salt over the pentagram inscribed in the floor. finally, he opens the cages and releases the crow, the falcon, and the great horned owl.}

<A>__{hodge is up on the burned out funeral pyre, anxiously scraping ashes and small bones into a leather pouch the remains of ulrich. up behind him comes galen, now clad in a traveler's cloak, with a pack on his back and a staff in his hand.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{hodge what are you doing?}
<A>__{hodge quickly conceals the pouch.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{just making my farewell, thank you very much.}
<A>__{he quickly climbs down, picks up his pack and follows galen out through the gate. as the door is pushed shut a huge oaken timber falls into place, barring the castle against the uninvited.}
