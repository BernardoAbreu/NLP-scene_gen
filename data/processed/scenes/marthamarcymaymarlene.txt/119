<L>__{exterior lake house dock day}
<A>__{martha stands on the dock. she strips down to her underwear and dives in. martha swims out into the lake. she drops under the water and out of sight, a burst of bubbles pop up to the surface. a few seconds pass by and she is not coming up. suddenly she breaks back through the water and gasps for air. she looks around at the thick woods and a handful of nice homes that appear to be empty now. no one else is swimming. martha sees a scruffy man sitting on a neighboring dock, he seems familiar. he is in his mid twenties, his jeans are rolled up and his feet dangle in the water. his shirt is slung over his shoulder and he smokes a cigarette. he looks directly at martha. they make eye contact. he finishes his smoke, throws the cigarette in the water, puts on his shirt and just sits there. martha swims back to the house.}
