<L>__{exterior ruined campsite night}
<A>__{sarah, malcolm, kelly, nick, roland, dr. juttson, and peter ludlow stand in the ruins of their campsite, their ranks decimated, spirits shattered. roland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was. he has pulled his .800 nitro express from the mud and more or less cleaned it, now he's checking the loads. kelly, nearly catatonic with fear, clings to sarah, and it doesn't look as if she'll ever let go. malcolm, who is on his knees picking through the wreckage of a tent, looks over at them, but sarah waves him off "she's okay." roland appears, standing over the group. he looks at malcolm, who has found the lindstradt rifle, intact.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{how many rounds did you find for that weapon?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{four, counting the one in the chamber.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{don't let it out of your hands again.}
<P>__{(to sara, but looking at kelly)}
<D>__{can the kid walk?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{ask her.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{can the kid walk?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i can. i can walk.}
<A>__{while he addresses the group, roland straps on one of the servo lights, the shoulder mounted flashlights that follow your gaze.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{we're going to find a path down into the interior of the island. load up whatever you think you need, and i mean need. if you can't carry it indefinitely, don't bring it. we'll hit the worker village in a couple hours and be out of here before dawn.}
<A>__{at the edge of camp, roland bends over one of the three toed footprints left by the rex. behind him, the rest of the group is packing up, slinging the remnants of their equipment over their shoulders. roland bends over and sniffs the footprinterior it's filled with a liquid of some kind. he takes his canteen, dumps the remaining water into the ground, and plunges the canteen into the footprint, filling it. ludlow hovers over his shoulder.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{piss.}
<A>__{ludlow doesn't ask. now at the fire, roland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that led to such disaster. he grabs a handful of the ash and shoves it in his pants pocket.}
