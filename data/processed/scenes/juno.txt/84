<T>__{back on juno and leah:}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{did you hear bleek is going to prom with katrina de voort?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{katrina? pfft, no way. he doesn't like katrina. it must be a pity date.}
<C>__{leah}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{he asked her. i heard they were going to benihana, then the prom, then to vijay's parents' cabin.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{bleeker told me katrina's whole house reeks of soup!}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{oh, it totally does. i was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like lipton landing. but you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{there's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{i wouldn't be so sure about that. he did it with you. he's a man now.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yeah, well, bleek trusted me. we're best friends.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{are you jealous? i thought you said you didn't care what he did.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i'm not jealous, and i don't care. i just know he doesn't like katrina and i don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. she seems so nice and all.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{okay juno, i'm really convinced.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{prom is for wenises, anyway. once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.}
