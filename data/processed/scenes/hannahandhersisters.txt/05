<L>__{interior hannah's living room night}
<A>__{the living room is crowded with family and guests sitting comfortably on chairs near the piano, where evan, hannah's father, plays "bewitched" as hannah's mother, norma, sits nearby, accompanying him in their duet. a child is sprawled out under a blanket on a sofa; some guests chatter quietly; others drink and eat, listening.}
<D>__{evan & norma}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{"a whimpering, simpering child again bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am i..."}
<A>__{as they continue to sing, the film cuts back to the kitchen, where lee, carrying some glasses, enters through the doorway.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{mom and dad are floating down memory lane again!}
<A>__{lee walks over to her sisters, putting the glasses down on a counter. hannah is scooping seeds out of a cantaloupe. holly, leaning on the table, sips her drink. the music from the living room is softly heard as the three sisters chat comfortably and easily with each other.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(smiling and turning to lee)}
<D>__{aah... hey, have you tried holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?}
<C>__{lee}

<A>__{the sisters all talk at once; hannah is still working at the sink.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{don't you think she does?}

<D>__{she really does, though.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(turning towards the sink)}
<D>__{yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(puffing on her cigarette)}
<D>__{god.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(scooping out some cantaloupe seeds)}
<D>__{maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(to lee, laughing)}
<D>__{i should get a garter belt.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(laughing)}

<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(whispering intently)}
<D>__{tch. he's such an angry...he's such a depressive. i thought she was moving out!}
<A>__{hannah shakes her head in disapproval while holly angrily takes another sip of her drink. and the film cuts briefly back to the living room, where evan is still playing the piano and singing. the camera moves past him and a few guests to norma, who is enthusiastically singing along, looking at evan and moving her hands.}
<D>__{evan & norma}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{"a pill he is but still he is all mine and i will keep him until he is bewitched, a'both "}
