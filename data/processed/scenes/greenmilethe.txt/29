<L>__{exterior field day (flashback)}
<A>__{the men reload their weapons. everybody's terrified. mcgee starts off, the other following his lead toward }
<B>__{the river}
<A>__{ where they emerge from the treeline, drawing ever closer to the source of that inhuman howling... ...and they stop, gazing in horror: john coffey sits on the riverbank in bloody overalls, his huge feet splayed out before him. he's making that inhuman howling sound, face twisted in monstrous grief, pausing occasionally to take in a great hitching breath of air. curled in his massive arms are the naked bodies of detterick's 9 year old twin girls, their once blonde hair now matted to their heads with blood. a tableau. the men staring. john coffey howling. a train puffing smoke across the landscape. klaus detterick breaks the moment, lunging down the riverbank in a headlong rush. the others try to grab him, but he shrugs them off and throws himself on coffey with a scream of inarticulate rage, kicking and punching, fists flying. coffey barely seems to notice. the others catch up with klaus, drag him off. he falls to his knees on the riverbank, sobbing into his hands. howie runs to him, throws himself into his father's arm. they hug each other tightly, overwhelmed with grief. a semblance of quiet descends, except for coffey's heartbroken wailing. a ring of rifle toting men forms around him, though he hardly seems aware of it. mcgee steps forward, uncertain:}
<D>__{mcgee mister.}
<A>__{coffey goes quiet at once, eyes still streaming tears.}
<D>__{mcgee mister? can you hear me?}
<P>__{(coffey nods)}
<D>__{you have a name?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{john coffey. like the drink, only not spelt the same.}
<A>__{mcgee hunkers carefully down, watching for any sudden moves.}
<D>__{mcgee what happened here, john coffey? you want to tell me that?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{i couldn't help it. i tried to take it back, but it was too late. mcgee}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{boy, you are under arrest for murder.}
<A>__{mcgee spits in coffey's face...}
<B>__{paul on bleachers}
<A>__{...as paul looks up with a slight start, jarred from his reading to find warden hal moores standing before him.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i interrupt?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm just about done.}
<A>__{paul stows the file as hal settles onto the bleachers.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{how's that pretty gal of yours?}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{melinda's not so well, paul. not so well at all. got laid up with another headache yesterday. worst one yet. she's also developed this weakness in her right hand.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{doctor still think it's migraines?}
<A>__{hal gives a slight shake of his head.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i will be taking her up to indianola next day or so for some tests. had x rays and the like. she is scared to death. truth to tell, so am i.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{if it's something they can see with an x ray, maybe it's something they can fix.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{he pulls a letter, hands it to paul.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{this just came in. d.o.e. on bitterbuck.}
<A>__{paul glances toward bitterbuck, scans the letter, nods.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you didn't come all the way down here just to hand me a d.o.e.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{no. i had an angry call from the state capital about twenty minutes ago. is it true you ordered percy wetmore off the block.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it is.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i'm sure you had reason, but like it or not, the wife of the governor of this state has only one nephew, and his name happens to be percy wetmore. i need to tell you how this lays out?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{little percy called his aunt and squealed like a schoolroom sissy.}
<P>__{(hal nods)}
<D>__{he also mention he assaulted a prisoner this morning out of sheer petulance? broke three fingers on eduard delacroix's left hand.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i didn't hear that part. i'm sure she didn't either.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the man is mean, careless, and stupid. bad combination in a place like this. sooner or later, he's gonna get somebody hurt. or worse.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{you and brutus howell will make sure that doesn't happen.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{easy enough to say. we can't watch him every minute, hal.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{stick with it. may not be much longer. i have it on good authority that percy has an application in at briar ridge.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the mental hospital?}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{administration job. better pay.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{then why's he still here? he could get that application pushed through...hell, with his connections, he could have any state job he wants.}
<A>__{hal has no answer. paul look off toward bitterbuck.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{tell you what i think. i think he just wants to see one cook up close.}
<A>__{hal follows paul's gaze, takes his meaning.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{well, he'll get his chance then, won't he? maybe then he'll be satisfied and move on. in the meantime, you'll keep the peace.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{thank you, paul.}
<A>__{hal rises, slapping yard dust off his trousers.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you give melinda my love, okay? i bet that x ray turns out to be nothing at all.}
<A>__{hal walks off looking like he's got the weight of the world on his shoulders. paul looks at the letter again...}
<B>__{tight on letter}
<A>__{...which is head: date of execution."}
