<A>__{moving down the corridor. now armed with marco's machine gun and carrying heinrich's kit bag, he seems more lethal.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(into cb)}
<D>__{bzzz! sorry, hans, wrong guess. would you like to go for double jeopardy, where the stakes are double and the scores really change?}
<A>__{he rolls heinrich over and is delighted to find a pack of gauloise's in the man's pocket. he takes them, pats the dead man's face.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(sotto, to the body)}
<D>__{bad for your health anyway.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{who are you, then?}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{just the fly in the ointment, hans. the monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass }
<A>__{mcclane stops in mid speech. he's just opened the kit bag heinrich had over his shoulder when he died. now mcclane takes out the contents...dozens and dozens of explosive detonators marked "danger" and a chunk of cello wrapped plastique the size of an electric razor. he whistles in surprise to himself. in the office, hans turns off his mike for a moment, turns to karl.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{check on all the others...don't use the radio. see if he's lying about marco and find out if anyone else is missing.}
<A>__{he moves. hans goes back onto the cb. meanwhile, mcclane smiles at the tell tale static as hans goes off and on. he knows what's happening. now, he starts to walk down a corridor, eyes panning from elevator to the stairwell doors.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{mr. mystery guest. are you still there?}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{i wouldn't think of leaving, hans. unless you want to open the front door...?}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{i'm afraid not. but you have me at a loss you know my name, but who are you?}
<P>__{(scornfully)}
<D>__{just another american who saw too many movies as a child. another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's john wayne...rambo... marshal dillion.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<D>__{actually, i was always partial to roy rogers. i really dug those sequined shirts.}
<C>__{hans}
<P>__{(harsh)}
<D>__{do you really think you have a chance against us, mr. cowboy?}
<A>__{a light blinks on the elevator.}
<C>__{mcclane}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{yipee yi yea...mother fucker.}
<A>__{mcclane goes quietly through the stairwell door and is gone by the time the search party steps onto this floor. hans sits quietly...thinking.}
