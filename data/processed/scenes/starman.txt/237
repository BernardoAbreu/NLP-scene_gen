<L>__{exterior desert night}
<A>__{the star man turns toward the cobra. weakly, he raises his weapon and pulls the trigger. nothing happens. the searchlight from the cobra finds them. its machine guns begin to raise puffs of gravel around them. jenny grabs the star man's arm and pulls him into the relative safety of the rocks. the star man collapses against the cool stone.}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(gasps)}
<D>__{i can't shoot anymore.}
<A>__{jenny looks out between the crags. shermin's helicopter arrives to join the cobra. with their searchlights flicking over the sagebrush, they move cautiously toward the cliff. jenny turns back to the star man. he is too weak to run anymore.}

<P>__{(touches his shoulder lightly)}
<D>__{i won't let anyone hurt you.}
