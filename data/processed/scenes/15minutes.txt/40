<L>__{interior a seedy bathroom day}
<A>__{emil pulls off his sock and shoe, lifts his foot into a stained sink and washes the blood away, exposing the chunk of pink flesh taken out of his ankle. emil grabs some toilet paper, plugs the wound, then cuts the towel off the dispenser with his kitchen knife and wraps his ankle. he grits teeth in pain. the lights go out. then oleg adjusts the fluorescent light above the sink.}
