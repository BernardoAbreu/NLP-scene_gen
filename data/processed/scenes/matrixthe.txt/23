<L>__{interior neo's apartment night}
<A>__{screaming, neo bolts upright in bed. he realizes that he is home. was it a dream? his mouth is normal. his stomach looks fine. he starts to take a deep, everything is okay breath, when the phone rings. it almost stops his heart. it continues ringing, building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed, sucking him in with an almost gravitational force. he answers it, saying nothing.}
<D>__{morpheus (v.o.). this line is tapped, so i must be brief.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{the agents }
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{they got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are. if they knew what i know, you would probably be dead.}
<A>__{neo feels sick.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{i don't know what you are thinking right now but i want you to understand that i will not give up on you until you give up on me.}
<A>__{neo's throat cracks, dry as the sahara.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{do you still want to meet?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{... yes.}
<C>__{morpheus }
<D>__{take the howard line south.}
<A>__{click. he closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done.}
