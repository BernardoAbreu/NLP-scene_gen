<L>__{exterior jungle nva bunker complex day}
<A>__{an overwhelming 103 degree heat. chris is once more on point, a little better now but obviously struggling with a thick unyielding bamboo thicket that forces him forward in a caveman crouch. napalm jelly is hanging from the trees in great canopies of spider webs, obliterating the sky.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{new year's day, 1968. just another day. staying alive. there's been a lot of movement neat the cambodian border, regiments of nva moving across. a lot of little firefights, ambushes, we drop a lot of bombs, then we walk through the napalm like ghosts in a landscape ...}
<A>__{chris working his way over twisted, broken stumps, branches. on the back of his flak jacket he's written, 'if i die bury me upside down so the whole world can kiss my ass'.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{pssst!}
<A>__{the signal for silence. chris freezes. barnes edging up to him.}
<C>__{barnes }
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{bunker ...}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{doesn't see it. following barnes' imperceptible movement of his head. the bunker, dug into the ground and camouflaged with brush, is staring right at him, not more than 20 feet away. chris is a dead man if ... barnes, checking the terrain, signals radioman hoyt. barnes edging up to the bunker, eyes everywhere. chris following. the tension builds. they come up to the edge of it, peer in. nothing. barnes walks around it, slips in from back. chris covers him, other guys coming up now, making a small perimeter. chris now starts to see things he didn't see. right in front of his nose there is a trench from this bunker to another and another. there is now in his view a complex of bunkers and thatched hootches and lean tos all blending into the forest. a ghost city ... elias and others fanning out now, careful ... whispered conversations in the wind. chris moves past a rope with freshly washed laundry stretching between two trees, clothes stirring in the wind. he looks up as king points out a treehouse, then looks down as lerner whispers something and points nva rucksacks are laid out on the ground in an orderly platoon sized pattern.}
