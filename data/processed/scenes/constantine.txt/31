<P>__{(heard it before)}
<D>__{i know, nobody's luck lasts forever.}
<A>__{he meets her eyes. exactly. he really does care. weiss breaks it off, leaves. angela turns to close her locker door, notices her reflection does not turn. she grabs the door, looks back in. reflection is as it should be. she shudders, slams the locker door.}
