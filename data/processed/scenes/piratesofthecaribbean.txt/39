<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{from behind the door of the dumbwaiter comes a crash, and a cloud of dust. the door slides open, and elizabeth clambers out. her head is cut, she is streaked with dirt, and can barely stand. she leans over the table, trying to recover. the sound of running footsteps gets louder ...}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{please, no ...}
<A>__{elizabeth touches the chain of the medallion ... and a desperate idea occurs to her. the pirates burst through the door. elizabeth backs away, holds the bread knife out to ward them off. they come around either side of the table, stalking her }

<P>__{(gasps it out)}
<D>__{par. .. parlay!}
<A>__{pintel can't believe his ears.}

<D>__{parlay! i invoke the right of parlay! according to" the code of the brethren, set down by the pirates morgan and bartholomew, you must take me to your captain!}
<C>__{pintel}
<D>__{i know the code.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{if an adversary demands parley, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.}
<C>__{pintel}
<D>__{it would appear, so do you.}
<C>__{smoldering pirate}
<D>__{to blazes with the code!}
<A>__{he steps forward, dirk drawn pintel stops him.}
<C>__{pintel}
<D>__{she wants to be taken to the captain, and she'll go without a fuss.}
<A>__{he looks to elizabeth: 'right?' elizabeth nods.}
<C>__{pintel }
<D>__{we must honor the code.}
<A>__{smoldering pirate concedes the point, sheaths his dirk. he grabs elizabeth roughly by the arm }
