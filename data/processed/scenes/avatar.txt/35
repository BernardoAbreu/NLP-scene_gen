<A>__{jake emerges, blinking in the morning sun. he finds himself in the avatar compound a living and training area. nearby, a couple of avatars are playing one on one in front of a (non regulation height) basketball net. others go about their daily activities around the compound. jake flexes his legs jumps and lands a little unsteadily, but his expression is joyful. he takes a few steps and breaks into a run. people are calling to him, somehwere, but he doesn't hear them he's running. running! he finds himself in the compound garden, and stops amid neatly tended rows of alien plants. he looks down, wiggling his toes in the warm soil. then inhales deeply revelling in the alien smells earth, plants, the nearby forest. he looks at his bare footprint in the soil of an alien world.}
