<A>__{the men watch all the doors. dead silence. dark. whispers.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{how long's it been?}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{little over two hours.}
<C>__{nauls}
<D>__{maybe it ain't coming.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{then we go after him.}
<C>__{nauls}
<D>__{bet the last place you ever go.}
<A>__{the sound of a door opening and closing. far off. another creaking door is opened. a rustling. still far off. macready and nauls spread further apart. the soft bubbling, cooling sound. a slight scratch at the door. garry's hand tightens around the generator switches. the scratching gets more pronounced. macready cautions garry with a whisper.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{wait...}
<A>__{the door begins to pound from the outside. nauls and macready light two cocktails each. the door booms. the room's foundations shake. the ceiling quivers. the gas bombs are cocked. from the roof the thing roars down into their midst. stunned, the men stumble back. macready throws his gas bomb. nauls the same. for a moment it stands silhouetted in flame. enormous. grotesque. garry bolts for the main door. the thing's tongue spirals from his mouth and spears him. the good two thirds of its body follows its tongue and engulfs garry by the door. another leg slaps nauls to the ground. macready dodges still another appendage, dives on the generators and throws the switch. the current rips through the door. garry dies instantly. one of the thing's talons, still caught in the door, sends it writhing in pain. it literally rips the door from its latchings and pounds it to the ground, trying to shake it loose. nauls, hobbles, scrambles, out of the opening. macready dives through the window and out into the storm.}
