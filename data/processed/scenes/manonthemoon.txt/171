<D>__{i apologize for all the wrestling i've ever done. i'm sorry for all the abuse i've ever given...}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{i was just playing bad guy wrestler. that's not me... it's just a role. but jerry took it personally.}
<A>__{lawler and letterman are unimpressed.}
<C>__{letterman}
<D>__{you said some pretty inflammatory things.}
<C>__{lawler}
<D>__{he thinks everything's a joke but it's not.}
<P>__{(to andy)}

<A>__{the crowd whoooos. angst flickers on andy's sweaty face. he stammers.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{t there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me }
<C>__{lawler}

<D>__{and you're just poor white trash!}
<A>__{lawler's had enough. enraged, he wildly stands and slaps andy. bam! andy crashes over and falls from his chair. thud. he's on the floor. dead silence. everyone is astonished. they're all slack jawed. even paul shaffer. trying to cover, paul hurriedly kicks in with a rockabilly tune. andy jumps up, crazed.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{i'm sick and tired of this shit!}
<A>__{lawler freezes in his seat. letterman hides behind his desk. andy storms over, out of control. from a safe distance, he starts screaming at lawler.}
