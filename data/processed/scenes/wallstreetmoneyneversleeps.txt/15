<L>__{interior jacob's apartment day}
<A>__{jacob lays on his couch vacantly pondering the ceiling. fox business plays on the new plasma tv on the wall... footage of the governor of new york, a tough looking man in his 40s, speaking to the press outside of the state capitol.}
<C>__{governor }
<D>__{i don't know anything about the solvency of keller zabel. i do know that what's bringing down the stock at this precise moment are rumors. and this practice of short selling american financial institutions then floating rumors in order to profit from them must be stopped. the uptick rule must be reinstated.}
<A>__{jacob glares over to the tv.}
<D>__{governor (footage) (cont'd) and once again, i will point to largely unregulated world of hedge funds... an ever growing and increasing powerful area of the market that i repeatedly tried to regulate as chairman of the sec...}
<A>__{and there's a loud knock on the door. jacob ignores it.}
<D>__{governor (footage) (cont'd) and the collapse of this legendary new york financial institution is why i continue to fight that battle as governor of this great state.}
<A>__{another knock... this time louder. jacob mutes the tv.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{from the door...}
<C>__{robby}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{jacob... answer the door.}
<A>__{jacob gets up, moves slowly and answers the door.}
<C>__{robby }
<D>__{you weren't answering your phone.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it broke.}
<A>__{robby sharply nods.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{dude...}
<A>__{he stops short... swallows...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{i just found this out and it hasn't hit the press yet.}
<A>__{once again... he stops short and looks away in frustration.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what? robby, what are you trying to say?}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{andrew zabel threw himself in front of the subway this morning.}
<A>__{jacob just stands in that doorway. no reaction at all. absolutely frozen.}
