<L>__{exterior lake tahoe dusk}
<A>__{magnificent harrah's dominates the skyline. the marquee blares "tony clifton and andy kaufman!" george screeches up in a rental car. he jumps out and runs inside.}
<L>__{interior harrah's showroom night}
<A>__{the showroom is packed. it hums with curiosity. waiters clean off the dinner tables. george rushes in and is seated in a far booth, with some strangers. he overhears a heated conversation between a pushy man and his wife.}
<C>__{pushy man}
<D>__{you're not listenin'! it's a very simple concept.}
<C>__{wife of pushy man}
<D>__{you're making no sense. how can they be the same person ?}
<C>__{pushy man}
<D>__{trust me! you'll never see them on stage at the same time!}
<A>__{the onstage orchestra hits a fanfare. lights dim. sharp spotlights meet at the foot of the stage. suddenly tony swaggers out, hands over his head in a gesture of triumph. thunderous applause. tony beams. the music stops. george leans in, curious as to how andy will wiggle out of this. tony bows theatrically, turns back to face the orchestra, and waits. the noise level slowly drops but not entirely. tony waits, and waits, and waits... until suddenly he turns towards the audience and screams}
<B>__{furiously.}
<C>__{tony clifton}
<D>__{shut up!!!!!!}
<A>__{everybody looks up, alarmed. the general murmur almost dies. tony stands there, eyes flashing with anger at all the unruly people. as they quiet down... tony turns back to the orchestra and raises his arms. the musicians lift their instruments. silence is total except for the clank of china. waiters are serving coffee. tony spins back around, livid.}
<C>__{tony clifton }
<D>__{that applies to you, too, penguins!!!}
<A>__{people signal "shh"! the waiters realize tony's addressing them, and they stare back in disbelief! this is their job!}
<C>__{tony clifton }
<D>__{yeah! yeah! you! i'm talkin' to you!! and you better freeze, or i will get your asses fired!!!}
<A>__{tony's outburst is so commanding that they all freeze. the waiters stand there like statues, staring in terror. satisfied, tony burns back to the orchestra and raises his arms. again, the musicians lift their instruments. in anticipation of loud music, the waiters start moving about. audience members start whispering. tony hears this and drops his arms and head in despair. the musicians lower their instruments. tony waits for absolute silence. only then does he signal the musicians to get ready again. they do. and then at that precise moment somebody drops a spoon. tony jolts, as if hit by a current. he drops his hands again, turns, and gives the perpetrator a murderous look. then he turns again, lowers his head, and waits. and waits. and waits. the man at george's table whispers to his wife.}
<C>__{pushy man}
<D>__{he's never gonna start! kaufman thinks this is funny!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we've paid forty bucks for a show that's never gonna start!}
<A>__{george grins stupidly. the silence is now deafening. slowly, very slowly, tony raises his arms. slowly... the musicians get their instruments ready. tony stands there, and stands, and stands, waiting for something... anything... to disturb the silence. in vain. somebody coughs. the whole scene repeats itself. finally finally tony is surrounded by total silence. then, (only a moment before the length of this scene would become unbearable), he begins to move. tony pivots around, looks at the audience... and the entire room looks like tussaud's wax museum. tony starts laughing hysterically. the audience's reaction is mixed: some people laugh. some boo. some ask perplexed questions. some scream obscenities. some even applaud. tony is very happy. he turns to the orchestra, raises his baton and commences the downbeat! the music begins. a spotlight hits the wings... and then andy strides out. george's jaw drops.}
<C>__{wife of pushy man}
<D>__{you see! i told you! they're not the same person!}
<A>__{the whole audience bursts into applause. life is back to normal. andy bows shyly and takes his place in front of a prepared row of congas. he starts to play. tony clifton grabs the microphone.}
<C>__{tony clifton}
<D>__{thank you! thank you! i wrote this tune for my friend frank sinatra. he had a nice little success with it... but forgot to thank me on the album.}
<A>__{he starts to belt "i gotta be me". george squints his eyes, trying to figure out who this is.}
<C>__{tony clifton }
<D>__{"whether i'm right or whether i'm wrong whether i find a place in this world or never belong! i gotta be me! i gotta be me! what else can i be, but what i am?"}
<A>__{tony's singing is awful. andy happily accompanies on congas. the audience doesn't know what to think. tony's singing reaches the end... aggressive and off key.}
<C>__{tony clifton }
<D>__{let's bring it on home }
<P>__{(he hits his screeching climax)}
<D>__{"i gotta be meeeeee!"}
<A>__{the band ends with a brassy punch. the crowd responds with}
<B>__{loud booing.}
