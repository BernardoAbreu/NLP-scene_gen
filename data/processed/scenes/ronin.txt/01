<L>__{interior a medieval cathedral night}
<A>__{it's dark, and so it takes us a minute to realize we're moving up stone spiraling stairs, up up up in what we now see is a medieval cathedral. and as we continue moving up something trickles down into frame blood. running thin, then thicker, as we continue to move up the stairs and find a body, sprawled awkwardly across the stones, arms and legs akimbo, not so much christ like as victim like. in one hand the body holds a gun he never had a chance to use. in the other a dark shape, we can't quite tell what it is. footsteps sound from above and the killer walks into frame, silenced pistol dangling at his side. we don't know him, and it's going to be a while before we see him again, but mark his face because we'll see him again. the killer now picks up the dark shape in the body's hand, and we see it's a briefcase. the killer cuffs the briefcase to his wrist and turns to two men standing behind him: subordinates. the killer shows them the briefcase.}
