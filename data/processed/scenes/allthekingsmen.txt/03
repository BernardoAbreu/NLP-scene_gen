<L>__{exterior kanoma city, day}
<A>__{as jack burden's jalopy pulls up before the kanoma county courthouse of this back country, one street small town.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{i found him in kanoma city. a typical, hot, dusty, backwoods county seat.}
<A>__{he gets out of the car, and notices a crowd of people gathered around a platform in the town square. as he walks over the begins to hear the words that willie stark is speaking.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{...to lie to them in order to line their own dirty pockets with the taxpayers' money. when have the citizens of kanoma county ever witnessed a campaign like this? why is the opposition so anxious to defeat me? why have they used every dirty method known to make sure i'm not elected county treasurer? well, i will tell you why...}
<A>__{a man in shirt sleeves and suspenders, tiny duffy, comes out of the local poolroom, listens for a moment to willie's speech, and signals to two uniformed men to go over and break up the gathering. jack burden stands close to the platform, next to willie's son, tom, who waits patiently to distribute handbills.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{...because they're afraid of the truth... and the truth is this. they're trying to steal your money. yeah, i said steal. the county commissioners rejected the bid on the schoolhouse. why? well, they'll tell you their reason is the job will be done better. the county commissioners would have you believe that they're interested in public welfare. they're interested in welfare, sure. but it's their own. let's look at the reason in the light of the facts and the figures. that brick factory is owned by one of the commissioners. that same brick factory uses convict labor.}
<A>__{the sheriff and his deputy push through the crowd.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{sorry, willie, you'll have to move on.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{city ordinance number one oh five: more than five people congregating is disturbing the peace.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(ignores him)}
<D>__{if you folks'll be so kind as to read these handbills, my boy will pass them out among you.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{there's an ordinance against that too.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(his face grim)}
<D>__{pass 'em out, tom.}
<A>__{the sheriff pushes tom back, grabbing the handbills out of his hand. willie jumps down off the platform.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{let him alone!}
<A>__{the sheriff collars willie, then notices jack on the platform snapping a picture.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<P>__{(to deputy)}
<D>__{get that camera! willie, you're under arrest.}
<A>__{he takes willie by the arm and leads him away. the crowd follows them to the courthouse. tiny duffy wipes the sweat off his neck and goes back into the poolroom.}
