<A>__{hysterical secretaries feverishly dump classified documents into a shredder, while perkins struggles to open the black leather briefcase handcuffed to his wrist. bullets tear up the doorknob lock arid serge kicks in the door.}

<A>__{the fawn halls hit the floor as gunfire sprays overhead. but perkins swings around brandishing his sidearm. he opens fire on serge, but the bullets smack harmlessly against the swat vest. serge returns fire, ripping up perkins who collapses over the shredder, and with his last bit of strength, he dumps out the briefcase. papers containing nucle war strategies and missile launch codes slide into the hungry shredding machine. perkins manages a slight smile before he keels over dead, his duty fulfilled. the shredded remains of the nuclear football rain over his head like tickertape at a hero's parade.}
