<D>__{i see tackling, but i don't see hitting. i see effort, but i don't see ferocity. what do you think, they're gonna motivate themselves? football's just a game to most of these kids. this is our program, our livelihood. it's our job to make them care as much about it as we do. make them hate me if you have to. it'll bring them together, give them a focus. so get off your butts and put the fear of god in these guys.}
