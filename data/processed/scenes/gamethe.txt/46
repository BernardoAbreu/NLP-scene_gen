<A>__{a slick, designery conference room, filled with babbling lawyers at the head of the table stands bob plympton, a trustworthy man in his late 50's. murmuring continues during plympton's address.}
<C>__{plympton}
<D>__{excuse me. excuse me! postponing the baer grace meeting is out of the question. schuyler gets on a plane for washington tomorrow morning at seven with every contract, every side agreement, the complete closing package!}
<A>__{schuyler has been going through paperwork in the back of the room, he steps forward during the above.}
<C>__{lawyer}
<D>__{but there's simply no }
<A>__{thwap! schuyler drops the stack of papers on the table, silence.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{no is not an option. if you fail to recognize that, i will find ten other law firms in the yellow pages that can get the job done }
<A>__{chirp. schuyler's cell phone has started ringing during the above. he finally removes it from his pocket and moves to a quiet corner.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{quiet commotion resumes in bg during the following. on the other end of the line, there's the bland, bureaucratic voice of cynthia:}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{mr. van orton?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{yes, who is this?}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{this is cynthia at crs...}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{what?! how did you get this number?}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{i'm just calling to inform you that we've finished processing your application }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i'm in a meeting }
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{ and i'm afraid you didn't qualify.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{ so i don't have time for }
<P>__{(beat, then quickly)}
<D>__{excuse me, what was that?}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{well... your application was rejected.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{...why?}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{oh, i'm afraid i don't have that information, but many applicants don't meet the criteria. we apologize, we hope it hasn't caused you any inconvenience }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{this is absurd }
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{thank you for thinking of crs.}
<A>__{click and a dial tone. schuyler shuts the phone and replaces it in his pocket, his mind suddenly far away from the meeting at hand. plympton, a wel1 meaning man with a fatherly attitude toward schuyler, steps close to him and speaks quietly, concerned:}
<C>__{plympton}
<D>__{bad news, sky?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{no, nothing. sorry, bob.}
<P>__{(loudly, to boardroom)}
<D>__{so were there any more questions, or may i assume it's under control...}
