<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior louvre day}
<A>__{the royal palace of louis xiii.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{have you seen the king?}
<C>__{seneschal }
<D>__{no, your majesty.}
<L>__{interior throne room day}
<A>__{anne, or rather, queen anne, steps into the throne room, a massive cathedral like chamber. twin thrones occupy a raised dais. an entire wall is covered with a spectacular map of the world. the map contains every known country and continent, including the new world. the seneschal exits, closing the doors with a resounding boom. anne pauses, all alone in the big, drafty chamber. and for the first time, she looks and acts her age. barely a woman, chilled by the ghosts of all the french kings and queens who came before her. and a long way from home. anne steps to the great map of the world. she reaches out to touch her own country, austria, feels a pang of separation. we hear:}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{your majesty...}
<A>__{anne reacts with a start. a tall, powerfully built man stands in the shadows, a spectre in red.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{cardinal richelieu, you surprised me.}
<A>__{cardinal richelieu steps out of the darkness. he smiles.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{how was your ride?}
<A>__{richelieu's question takes her by surprise. he bows before anne. considering a reply, she extends her hand. the cardinal kisses it.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{my ride...? well, i... i'm not sure...}
<C>__{richelieu}
<P>__{(rising up)}
<D>__{forgive me.}
<C>__{richelieu }
<D>__{but your welfare is more than a matter of personal interest. it is a matter of state. but rest assured, your secret is safe with me.}
<A>__{his manner is both charming and paternal. anne, smart enough to exercise caution in all her palace dealings, is nonetheless touched by his concern.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{richelieu turns to the great map, speaks gently.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{you're homesick.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{lonely. is that the same thing?}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{sometimes.}
<A>__{richelieu brings his eyes back to anne, continues:}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{austria's loss is france's gain.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i'm not sure my new husband shares your opinion.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{nonsense. he's young, not blind.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{mostly, he is absent. i've barely seen his majesty since our wedding, and that was three months ago. whenever he's around me, he has nothing to say.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{arranged marriages can be difficult. your father and i thought yours would bring austria and france closer together.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{countries align more swiftly than people, i'm afraid. louis and i remain... far apart.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{may i advise you?}
<A>__{he says it with seeming humility, not condescension. anne nods assent.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{louis was only nine years old when his father was assassinated. he lost his childhood forever that day. i have watched him grow toward manhood, seen the toll his life demands. a boy who is not allowed to be a boy sometimes has difficulty becoming a man. he is shy, yet boastful. giving, yet stubborn. but most of all, he is not yet sure exactly who he is. the boy who lost his father. or the king of france.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but how can i...?}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{flatter him. make the boy feel like a king. so that the king may be your husband.}
<A>__{anne considers his eloquent advice, formulates a reply... when the huge doors to the throne room open with a dull boom, the seneschal chants:}
<C>__{seneschal}
<D>__{his majesty, the king.}
<A>__{the seneschal steps aside as louis xiii enters. he is surprisingly young, no older than d'artagnan. his face is handsome and intelligent.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{your majesty.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{cardinal richelieu, i've been looking for you.}
<A>__{as louis strides toward them, richelieu and anne bow. when louis sees anne, he reacts with an almost imperceptible start. her presence catches him off guard.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{oh. anne. hello. i didn't know you were here.}
<A>__{louis hides his nervousness, not to mention his love, behind a formal veneer. anne, emboldened by richelieu's confidences, replies:}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{would you like me to go?}
<A>__{louis suddenly remembers the reason he's here. determination breeds a more capable attitude.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{no. please, stay.}
<P>__{(to richelieu, aware}
<D>__{that she is watching}
<P>__{him)}
<D>__{your eminence, i demand an answer.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<P>__{(hiding his amusement)}
<D>__{perhaps if i knew the question...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i've just been told that you went ahead and disbanded my musketeers.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{you approved the decision.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{but not the timing of the matter. i intended to address them myself, explain the situation...}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{your majesty, france is on the brink of war. we dare not hesitate.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{but these men are my personal guards...}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{they are the bravest fighters in france.}
<C>__{richelieu }
<D>__{we'll need them in the field if we're to win this war with england. buckingham plans to invade la rochelle within the month. i thought it best to act quickly }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i will be the judge of what is best. for me, and for france.}
<A>__{he says it with newfound resolve. richelieu receives the rebuke with quiet grace. anne watches the latter closely, suppresses a smile. the boy is nearer to king than richelieu imagined.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{of course. forgive me.}
<A>__{a tense beat. anne, feeling out of place, steps toward the door.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{anne? are you all right?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you two should continue this discussion in private.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(hesitates, seeks a}
<D>__{reason for her to}
<P>__{stay)}
<D>__{your thoughts on the matter interest me. they might... help.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{it seems to me that... you're doing very well on your own.}
<A>__{she means it. anne smiles, exits. a beat. louis sighs.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{she's beautiful.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{extremely.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{intelligent.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{very.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{sometimes she scares me half to death.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{may i advise you?}
<A>__{repetition reveals calculation. louis nods. and the cardinal surprises with quiet humor:}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{she scares me too. as do all women who join beauty to intelligence. what's a man to do?}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(enjoying the cardinal's humor)}
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{the course of love is full of frightful turns. but, no matter how you feel, no matter how hopelessly afraid... never let her know that you are anything other than the bravest and most confident man in france. make that your starting point, and everything else will fall... into place.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{the bravest man in france...}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{good advice for a shopkeeper. let alone a king.}
<A>__{a beat. richelieu acting as the lost father. and louis appreciating it, speaking as a son:}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{your eminence, i'm sorry that i was sharp with you. it's just that the musketeers... well, they're not just my guards. they're my friends too.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{i know. but don't worry.}
<C>__{richelieu }
<D>__{from now on, i will take complete responsibility for your welfare.}
<A>__{indeed he will.}
