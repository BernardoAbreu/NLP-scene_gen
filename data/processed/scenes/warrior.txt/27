<L>__{interior brendan and tess' home kid's playroom night}
<A>__{brendan sits in a miniature playroom off the kid's bedroom, putting glue on the leg of a toy piano. tess enters the bedroom, where the girls sleep, and leans into the playroom. they speak in whispers.}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(off piano)}
<D>__{the girls have an important piano recital in the morning. got an equipment malfunction.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how'd it go?}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{they're gonna review your case at the end of the semester, but until then you're suspended without pay. joe gave me the number of his attorney.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{how the hell are we gonna pay for an attorney?}
<A>__{tess crouches down and enters the tiny room. she sits on the floor.}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{he talked to me for free. as a favor to joe.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{that was nice.}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{he said there's no precedent for this. you'll be back by next semester.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{next semester?}
<A>__{tess sighs. they sit in silence. there are no easy solutions. finally, brendan speaks up.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{look, tess. they have these smoker fights all over. there's one in lancaster next week. there's two in dover the week after. wilmington. camden. baltimore. it could keep us afloat.}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{you're gonna put yourself through this over and over, for five hundred bucks a pop?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{some of them pay a little more than that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i would have had to bounce for a month to make what i made in two hours last night.}
<A>__{brendan looks at his wife.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{and these guys, they're not real fighters. they're just guys who have seen too much ufc on tv. if you have a better solution, i'm all ears.}
<A>__{tess sits quietly. knows they have limited options.}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{what are we gonna tell the girls?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{it'll be fine. i will just leave the house as usual, except now i will be going to the gym.}
<A>__{they look at each other. no choice. this is the plan.}
