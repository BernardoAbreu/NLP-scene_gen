<D>__{alright gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. i expect a clean fight. obey my commands at all times. defend yourselves at all times. touch gloves, go back, let's do this.}
<A>__{in the center of the cage, mad dog is practically spitting in tommy's face. tommy's eyelids droop. he could not be less intimidated.}

<A>__{it's such a savage beating, so malicious, that rosenthal has to climb on tommy's back to get him off of mad dog. if his mother is indeed in the crowd, she couldn't recognize him now. beaten to an absolute pulp.}

<D>__{mad dog grimes has been poleaxed. he is not moving.}
<A>__{tommy marches out of the cage and past colt boyd, punkass, and skyskrape, who can't believe what they just witnessed. neither can anyone else at boardwalk hall. in the cage, a medic tends to mad dog.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{i will tell you what: you do that to someone on the street and they'd lock you up and throw away the key! break out the yellow tape, sam. tommy's walking away from the cage like he's leaving a crime scene.}
