<A>__{corey swallows two of her pills with some liquor from a plastic cup. she sits down on one of the full size beds where sam's belongings are spread out. she opens sam's backpack and discovers the philosophy of time travel book, by roberta sparrow... as corey studies the cover, her image is reflected by the closet door mirrors. the angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for other objects in the room. strangely, corey's reflection is only present in one of the panes. the digital clock radio shows 6:30 pm... there are pictures of sam's family tucked away inside the book, between the pages: sam with her mother and father, rose and eddie darko; young sam with elizabeth and donnie; an old photo of the whole darko family together young sam holds ariel, a stuffed toy unicorn. corey removes the pictures and sets them on the nightstand... she then looks down and notices that the book is open to: chapter three the fragmentary universe.}
