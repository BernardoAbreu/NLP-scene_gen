<L>__{exterior abandoned house day}
<A>__{on the outskirts of town. in disrepair peeling paint, broken windows, damp stained walls but habitable. eli stands in the front yard, surrounded by brownish, overgrown weeds. thinking it over. turns to face the setting sun. it will be dark soon. he turns back toward the house.}
<L>__{interior abandoned house day}
<A>__{the front door is sent crashing open with a hard kick, revealing eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. the shotgun unhitched from his pack and held ready. he moves inside. another dead place. flies buzzing in the still, dank air. everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise largely preserved. an eerie snapshot of a world long gone.}
<B>__{kitchen}
<A>__{every cupboard empty. eli checks each one, poking around in the dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust. he opens the freezer, checks inside. empty save for a small icebox. the lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. eli digs at it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open. inside are the wizened, petrified remains of a human hand. floating in slimy, discolored water. the smell vile and thick enough to make eli retch. he quickly jams the lid back on.}
<B>__{bedroom}
<A>__{a wooden bedframe stripped clean. the dresser drawers have been emptied and lie strewn across the floor. eli moves toward a large walk in closet and opens the door. no clothes inside just the near fossilized corpse of a man hanging by a noose. twisting gently back and forth. unfazed, eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. an old pair of converse all stars hang limp from the man's skeletal ankles. eli calmly sets about unlacing them. he checks the size; they're a fit. he upturns each shoe and shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. discards his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up. he walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the new shoes. they feel good. for the first time, he smiles.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{eli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat over a small campfire. he cleans the animal's pelts as he watches it cook. pokes at the meat with a pen knife, checking it for done ness. it appears ready to eat. he clasps his hands together in prayer.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{dear lord, thank you for your generosity in providing us today with this bountiful feast.}
<A>__{he speaks quietly, his voice barely above a whisper. even so, we catch the accent a raspy, old world midwest drawl, like john wayne or some other long forgotten western icon.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{thank you for the many gifts that you have given me. thank you for your protection and your guidance. thank you for bringing me this far. i know my long journey's end is near. i ask now only for the strength and the courage to complete the task that you in your infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow upon me over all men. i won't let you down. amen.}
<A>__{he signs a cross over himself, then uses the knife to saw off a chunk of meat. takes a bite, savoring the taste with great relish. to him, it's grade a filet mignon.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{hey. you hungry?}
<A>__{it appears as though he is talking to himself... until a rat emerges from his coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. eli offers it some meat. the rat gnaws enthusiastically at it.}
<B>__{sundown}
<A>__{the last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's broken window. eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a small package wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string. he sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. it's an old leather bound book. the binding cracked and pages dog eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more. eli gazes lovingly at it. lets his fingers play across the beat up old leather cover. a cherished thing. he begins to read, half hidden in the shadows of the fading sunlight. silently mouthing the words as he reads them.}
<B>__{many pages later}
<A>__{eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before. replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else. a car battery. old and streaked with acid stains. attached to a tangled bunch of electrical wiring and jumper cables. eli reaches into his pocket and produces: an ipod. badly beat up, the case pretty much held together with duct tape. but functional. eli attaches the battery cable to the ipod and places the headphones in his ears. the music plays. mozart's piano concerto no. 20 in d minor. eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up. the music swells. eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air, as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by the music to another world, a world far from this one.}
<B>__{morning}
<A>__{sunlight shafts through the window. eli sits slumped in the exact same position, headphones still in his ears. asleep. the rat scurries up eli's chest and licks his face. slowly, he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on. checks the battery. it's dead, drained overnight. he frowns. he gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside. all seems quiet. he loads up his backpack and weapons.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{come on now.}
<A>__{the rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears into the breast pocket. eli turns and moves out.}
