<L>__{interior waiting room day}
<A>__{miguel and marcos sit on a couch in a bare walled waiting room outside alvarez's office. they sit quietly, like two kids waiting for the principal. coach reyes pokes his head out of alvarez's office, motions them inside.}
<L>__{interior alvarez's office moments later}
<A>__{miguel and marcos stare straight ahead, nervously. alvarez stares at them, icy cold. after a beat...}
<C>__{alvarez}
<D>__{i am very disappointed. just when i was starting to like you guys, you go and do something stupid. what do you have to say for yourselves?}
<C>__{marcos}
<D>__{but alfonso was there too }
<C>__{alvarez}
<D>__{ no excuses. this is unacceptable behavior. you guys need to learn discipline.}
<A>__{miguel and marcos lower their heads.}
<C>__{reyes}
<D>__{you need to remember that you still have a long way to go, a lot of hard work ahead of you before you make it. first, there's getting your shot in the american minor leagues: rookie ball, single, double, triple a all that before you even set foot in a major league ballpark. so, you better pull it together quick...}
<C>__{alvarez}
<D>__{because nobody's gonna take this shit from a couple dominican rookies when you go to the u.s. for spring training this season.}
<A>__{they glance up, eyes wide. did he just say...}
<C>__{reyes}
<D>__{you've been invited to spring training.}
<A>__{everyone smiles (even alvarez).}
