<L>__{interior main cabin crash ship day}
<A>__{a shadow falls over riddick. he doesn't look up.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{found somethin' worse than me, huh?}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{we're movin'. and i'm just wondering if i shouldn't lighten the load right now.}
<A>__{now their eyes meet. johns ratchets his shotgun and points it at riddick's head.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{woof, woof.}
<A>__{the shotgun explodes. camera pans off of johns to show riddick still alive. the shotgun discharged next to his head and blew off his wrist chains.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{want you to remember this moment, riddick. the way it coulda gone and didn't.}
<C>__{riddick}
<P>__{(deaf)}
<D>__{say that again.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{here's the deal. you work without the chains, without the bit without the shivs. you help us get off this rock....}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{for what? the honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{truth is, riddick, i'm tired of this head up shit. i wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.}
<A>__{a beat. the future rearranges in riddick's head.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{you'd cut me loose, boss?}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{only if we both get outta this alive. and there may be a way.}
<A>__{he offers a hand to help riddick up, to seal the deal.}
<C>__{riddick}
<P>__{(staring at hand)}
<D>__{my recommendation: do me. don't take the chance that i will get shiv happy on your wannabe ass. ghost me, riddick. would if i were you.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{if you were me, i'd kill us both. c'mon, you wanna sit at the grown up table or not?}
<A>__{a beat. riddick reaches out for the hand and grabs the shotgun with his off hand . a blur of movement. suddenly johns is staring at the eyes of his own shotgun.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{want you to remember this moment.}
<A>__{he pumps shotgun, spitting blue shells over johns. he drops the emptied gun and walks away.}
