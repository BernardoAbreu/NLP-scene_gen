<A>__{schuyler sits on a couch, looking at the forms.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i know what you mean. look what is all this?}
<A>__{the fast talking feingold moves energetically through the office, occasionally picking at his food or poking at the air with chopsticks he's a bit hyper and fidgety in general.}
<C>__{feingold}
<D>__{application, mmpi and tat tests, financial statement...}
<P>__{(indicating food)}
<D>__{want some? tung hoy, best in chinatown...}

<D>__{let's back up here }
<C>__{feingold}
<P>__{(over him)}
<D>__{b, we need an idea of your abilities and limitations, what turns you on, and off. numero tres, our insurance company requires it.}
<P>__{(a beat, studying schuyler)}
<D>__{you're familiar with our service, aren't you?}

<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{a game.}
<C>__{feingold}
<D>__{recharges the batteries, gets you off the treadmill, it's an experience. sort of a vacation for the guy who's been everywhere.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{this really doesn't sound like my sort of }
<A>__{feingold sits on the edge of his desk, arms crossed, nodding and smiling condescendingly he raises a hand to stop schuyler.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{what's so amusing?}
<C>__{feingold}
<D>__{nothing. i know who you are. you're david van orton's brother, he got you in here.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{so.}
<C>__{feingold}
<P>__{(remembering fondly)}
<D>__{david was impressive, one of the better i've seen. but frankly, i can see you're not the type.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{the type.}
<C>__{feingold}
<D>__{you know, a player.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i'm not a player.}
<C>__{feingold}
<D>__{i don't mean anything personal by it i know you're an important guy, powerful guy, you're used to being on top. it's just, this isn't for everyone. not everyone can handle it.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<P>__{(nearly losing it)}
<D>__{what kind of fu game is this?}
<C>__{feingold}
<D>__{the ultimate fucking game. i wish i could tell you more, but it's different every time.}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{thanks for coming in }
<C>__{schuyler}
<P>__{(doesn't move)}
<D>__{i'm not an idiot. i see what you're doing. first the vague yet intriguing pitch, then i'm supposed to feel like my manhood's in question because i'm not up for, what, some motivational role playing fantasy nonsense }
<C>__{feingold}
<D>__{interesting, you don't know the first thing about it but you've already decided what it is... listen, i don't wanna waste any more }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{please, jim, cut the hard to get shit. i've got the afternoon free, i will take your silly tests.}
<A>__{feingold cocks his head, reappraising him. then, with a smile, he calls to an attractive young woman passing in the hall; schuyler, meanwhile, flips through the pages of the tests.}
<C>__{feingold}
<D>__{ms. nelson, are you busy? we need someone to run mr. van orton.}
<C>__{ms. nelson}
<D>__{this way, sir...}
<A>__{as she leads schuyler out the door, feingold winks at him.}
<C>__{feingold}
<D>__{i will catch up with you after the physical.}
<A>__{schuyler reacts a physical? he throws up a hand and follows the woman into the hall. alone now, feingold cracks a fortune cookie and glances at the slip of paper inside. he furrows his brow with concern at the fortune then tosses it aside.}
