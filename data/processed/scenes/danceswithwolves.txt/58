<L>__{exterior supply house day}
<A>__{with a grunt dunbar lugs an army saddle out of the supply house and starts for the door. he slows to a stop and stares down at the saddle as if in a trance. in a moment he is tossing the saddle back where he found it.}
<L>__{exterior hillside day}
<A>__{dunbar is leading cisco to the top of a low hill. he glances over his shoulder and sees that he is being followed. the wolf with two socks stops when dunbar looks back at him. dunbar watches him curiously for a moment and continues leading cisco up the hill. but now he's glancing regularly over his shoulder and discovers that as he moves, so does the wolf. reaching the top of the hill, dunbar pauses. he pulls out the pocket telescope and sweeps the prairie. there is nothing. now dunbar swings onto cisco's bare back and with a last glance back at the wolf starts down the rise and on to the open prairie at an easy canter. we follow for a little distance. dunbar glances once more over his shoulder. the wolf is sitting on top of the hill watching. he has decided to come no further.}
