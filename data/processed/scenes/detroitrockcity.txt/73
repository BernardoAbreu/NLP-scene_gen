<L>__{exterior w.a.r.p. tower night}
<A>__{cobo hall looms up ahead. hawk, trip, lex, and jam enter the sidewalk. a thickening crowd of kiss fans continually meander by. on their way to the car, they suddenly hear a woman's voice bellowing through a megaphone from somewhere down the street. after a moment they see the voice's source. a group of women has congregated about forty feet ahead and their leader, her back toward the boys, yells to the group through her bullhorn. flying above them all is a large banner reading: "matmok, mothers against the music of kiss."}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{welcome to the first open meeting of matmok, mothers against the music of kiss!"}
<A>__{the group cheers as the kiss fans milling around them pretty much ignore the whole matmok spectacle. lex looks away from the matmoks and into the street. we can't see what he sees, but we can tell he's alarmed.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{uh... dudes?}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(ignoring lex)}
<D>__{now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{dudes!}
<A>__{they all look at lex.}
<C>__{lex}
<P>__{(eyes focused ahead)}
<D>__{where's the volvo?}
<A>__{hawk, trip, and jam look at their parking spot to see a beat up dodge dart sitting there instead of the volvo.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{it's gone.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i can see that, bright boy. what happened to it?}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{it was stolen!}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{christine stole it! asleep, my ass! the stella booted with your mom's wheels.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{but we took the keys?}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{damn, she musta hot wired it. we picked up a professional car thief in the shape of olivia newton john!}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{okay, i'm just a little mad now! jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{i'm sorry, guys. i thought it was a nice thing to do.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{jam, not another word out of your femmy ass mouth! okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. we're totally committed. it's time to brainstorm.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{here's a suggestion. let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this volvo situation.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{wake up, lex. this is detroit. the cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a swedish car. face it, the volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by christine, the chop shop gourmet.}
<A>__{lex is developing a look of resolve. this is detroit!}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{now listen up. here's the game plan.}
<C>__{lex}
<P>__{(on a roll)}
<D>__{...i mean, my mom's got insurance. what's the worst thing she could do? ground me for the entire year? i can handle that...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{cool, bro, now listen up...}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{...holy shit! i am in absolute trouble! i never should have let you drive, man! absolute fuckin' trouble!}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{okay, shut the fuck up, lex! now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. i got...}
<P>__{(takes out kiss money clip)}
<D>__{twenty five.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{twenty five more'n i got.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{all i got is five. the rest is in the volvo.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{i got...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{uh uh. don't tell us, jam. just show us.}
<A>__{jam holds up a ten keeping his mouth shut.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{so maybe we got enough for one ticket. fuck!}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{waitaminit, dudes! i got it! we find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. what do you think?}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{brilliance, trip. sheer brilliance. give albert einstein here the nobel prize.}
<A>__{trip smiles proudly.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i think we should try sneaking in.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{four dudes sneaking in? we'd get busted fer sure. bad plan.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re enter" the concerto. voila!}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{still too risky for my money.}
<P>__{(looking at watch)}
<D>__{we're running out of time here. this is kiss! a victory for one is a victory for the team. i'm sure i can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. we'll reconvene at that intersection...}
<A>__{hawk points to the intersection where the church, the male strip joint, the parking lot, and the smiley mart are located.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{...at twenty thirty hours.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{one more time in english.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{for the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 p.m. we'll meet over there.}
<C>__{jam}
<P>__{(inspired)}
<D>__{wait! i know how we can get in!}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{jam, shut up! you're not allowed to speak, remember? go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. i don't wanna hear it.}
<C>__{jam}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{but... my plan involves all four of us acting together.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{see you at 8:30, jam. later.}
<P>__{(to lex and trip)}
<D>__{dudes? later.}
<A>__{hawk, trip, and lex split up, leaving jam alone. he starts walking in the opposite direction, passing matmoks. the leader is still on a roll, yelling through the megaphone.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{look around you tonight, mothers! look at all the young faces! they smile and laugh but their eyes have lost all hope! not one among them appears to possess the love and fear of god... this satanic group kiss has stolen their souls.}
<A>__{the leader's gaze finally falls upon jam. he lets out a gasp. yes, the leader is mrs. bruce. so this was her church meeting. she freezes when she sees her son; her jaw slackens. meanwhile jam looks stunned beyond comprehension.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{oh... dear... lord!!}
<A>__{mrs. bruce quickly hands the megaphone to another matmok member, who picks up where mrs. bruce left off. jam looks around for someplace to run and hide, but it's too late. mrs. bruce slices through the crowd of kiss fans and grabs jam by the ear. he yelps.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce}
<D>__{i don't know how you got here tonight and i don't want to know either. all i know is you're going to pay dearly for this one, young man!}
