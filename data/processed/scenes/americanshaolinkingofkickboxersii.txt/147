<L>__{exterior waterfall early morning}
<B>__{establishing shot of thundering waterfall.}
<A>__{drew stands at the side of the waterfall, studying his map. from his expression, we know that he has to go through the waterfall to get where he is going. drew pockets the map, checks that the box is safely in place, then starts toward the waterfall. the drop off the side of the waterfall is incedible steep and deadly.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{as he enters the waterfall. the water hits his back, almost pitching him into the abyss. drew concentrates and moves forward, slowly but surely. he emerges on the other side, only to be confronted by a swamp. jutting out of the swamp are rocks and tree stumps. drew examines the distance between the objects, realizing that he can jump from place to place and make it across.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{just like at the temple...}
<A>__{he starts out, jumping onto the first stone, then moving on to the others. he almost falls a couple of times, but regains his balance. he gets a rythm going, and is soon almost halfway across. he gets to one particular rock, only to find out that it's the head of an alligator! its mouth opens to bite him! drew jumps off it quickly, onto a tree stump. when he lands on the stump, he examines it carefully to make sure it isn't something else. he continues across, more careful this time.}
