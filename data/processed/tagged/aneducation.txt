<L>__{interior school. day}
<A>__{january 1962. montage a nice girls' school in a south west london suburb. we see girls doing what girls did in a nice girls' school in 1962: walking with books on their heads, practising their handwriting, making cakes, playing lacrosse, dancing with each other.}
<L>__{interior classroom. day}
<A>__{in one of the classrooms, miss stubbs, an attractive, bright, animated schoolteacher, is talking to a small group of sixteen year old girls. some of these girls seem to be daydreaming looking out of the window, examining their fingernails. a couple, including a bespectacled girl who looks five years younger than everyone else in the class, write down everything the teacher says. only one, jenny, beautiful and animated, seems to be listening in the spirit in which miss stubbs would like her to listen. she's smiling, eyes shining she loves miss stubbs, and these lessons. miss stubbs asks a question, and jenny puts up her hand the only one in the class to do so.}

<P>__{(mock sighing)}
<D>__{jenny. again.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{isn't it because mr rochester's blind?}
<L>__{interior bedroom. day}
<A>__{jenny's bedroom. books about ponies, a much loved teddy bear; a cello huge in the small room leans against the wall. jenny is bent over a small desk. victorian novels, latin primers and dictionaries teeter in huge towers either side of her. she stands and stretches as she turns to us. she kneels and flicks through her half dozen or so lps on the floor near a cheap record player they're all classical, mostly by elgar, apart from a juliette greco record. this is the one she chooses. as the music begins, she sings along. immediately there is a thumping noise someone underneath her is banging on the ceiling impatiently.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{i don't want to hear any french singing. french singing wasn't on the syllabus, last time i looked. jenny sighs, and reaches for the volume control. she turns the music down so low that she has to lie down and put her head right next to the dansette to hear it. close on jenny as she silently mouths the words along with the almost inaudible track.}
<L>__{interior living room. day}
<D>__{jenny, her mother and father are finishing sunday lunch. jenny's father jack is in his forties, marjorie, her mother is slightly younger than jack, but every bit as middle aged. the food is grey and brown, in keeping with the colour scheme of the house. they aren't talking they're listening to mantovani on the radio. jenny gets up from the lunch table.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i've got an english essay to do by tomorrow morning.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't want to hear anything through the ceiling this afternoon, apart from the sound of sweat dripping onto textbooks.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{cello?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no cello.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i thought we agreed that cello was my interest or hobby?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's already your interest or hobby. when they ask you "what's your interest or hobby?" at your oxford interview, you can say, "cello". that wouldn't be a lie. you don't need to practise a hobby. a hobby is a hobby.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{or interest.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(ignoring her)}
<D>__{you don't need to be good at it. you just have to be interested in it.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{can i stop going to the youth orchestra, then?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no. the orchestra shows you're a joiner inner. universities like joiner inners.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{ah. yes. but. i've already joined in. so now i can stop.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, if you stop, that shows the opposite, doesn't it? that shows you're a rebel. they don't want that at oxford.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{no. they don't want people who think for themselves.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(missing the sarcasm, as is his wont)}
<D>__{course they don't.}
<L>__{interior school hall. day}
<D>__{jenny with cello sits in the string section. everyone is getting settled, tuning up, latecomers still arriving. along the row from jenny, tuning his violin, is a nice looking boy of her age, graham, and she waves at him. two 13 year old boys sitting between them wave too, parodically, and then blow kisses, much to graham's embarrassment and jenny's fury. the silly boys dissolve in fits of giggles: this is clearly one of the funniest moments of their lives until one of them farts noisily and, it would appear from all the frantic gesturing, pungently. the comic value of the fart tops even the comic value of the wave, and they are scarcely able to stay seated, such is their mirth.}
<L>__{exterior school. day}
<D>__{jenny and graham are talking while he struggles to take his bike out of a bicycle rack slightly unbalanced by the violin strapped to his back. graham is nervous, chronically unconfident and shy.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{should i wear, you know, sunday best?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you'd better, i'm afraid. just to show my father you're un jeune homme serieux, not a teddy boy.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{oh, god.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{it'll be all right. i won't wait. it's going to bucket down in a minute. i will see you at the weekend. jenny moves as quickly as she can towards the street.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{oh, yes. bye. the two silly boys from before arrive to blow more kisses.}
<C>__{smaller boy 1}
<D>__{goodbye, darling! see you at the weekend! i will miss you with all of my heart! graham blushes. jenny swipes the chief offender over the head with her sheet music.}
<L>__{exterior bus stop. day}
<D>__{the rain has begun. jenny attempts to cover herself. a mother and two children cross the road in front of her, and a beautiful, sleek red sports car a bristol stops to let them across. david, possibly in his mid thirties, dapper, and almost but not quite handsome, is driving the car. david, distracted, impatient, spots jenny at the bus stop. in front of the car a small wellington boot drops off the foot of one of the children,further slowing down their painfully slow progress across the road. jenny is wet. david makes eye contact. jenny smiles ruefully, and enchantingly. david sighs, and then hesitates for a moment. the window of the bristol slowly rolls down.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hello. jenny ignores him.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{listen. if you've got any sense, you wouldn't take a lift from a strange man. jenny smiles thinly.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i am, however, a music lover, and i'm worried about your cello. so what i propose is, you put it in the car and walk alongside me.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{how do i know you won't just drive off with the cello?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{ah. good pointerior he winds down the other window and waves on the cars that have stopped behind him.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{how much does a new cello cost? twenty pounds? thirty? i don't know. let's say thirty. he pulls out a wallet, takes out three ten pound notes, hands them to her.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{there. security. jenny laughs and waves the money away.}
<L>__{exterior street. near school. day.}
<D>__{later. the cello is in the back seat of the bristol. jenny is trotting alongside the car, while david leans nonchalantly across the passenger seat to talk to her while driving.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm david, by the way. she says nothing.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and you are...?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{jenny. (beat) i've never seen a car like this before. c'est tres chic.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's a bristol. not many of `em made. jenny nods, but doesn't know how to respond.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{how did the concert go?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{it was a rehearsal. the concert's next thursday.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what are you playing?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(making a face)}
<D>__{elgar.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{ah, elgar. i often think it's a shame he spent so much time in worcester, don't you? worcester's too near birmingham. and you can hear that in the music. there's a horrible brummy accent in there, if you listen hard enough. jenny looks at him and smiles. she hadn't expected him to be able to make elgar jokes.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{anyway, i'm not sure elgar and jews mix very well.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i'm not a jew!}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{no. i am. i wasn't...accusing you.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oh. (she smiles awkwardly.) can i sit in the car with my cello? david stops the car.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{jump in.}
<L>__{interior car. day}
<D>__{jenny shuts the door and sinks approvingly into the white leather seat. david regards the dripping girl with amusement.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{it's even nicer on the inside.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{where to, madam?}
<A>__{jenny makes a face.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i only live round the corner.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what a shame. we'll just make it last as long as we can.}
<L>__{exterior street. near jenny's. day}
<A>__{the bristol is crawling along the road at walking pace.}
<L>__{10 int exterior car jenny's house. day}
<A>__{david reaches across jenny while driving slowly, opens the glove compartment and takes out a packet of cigarettes.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{smoke?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i'd better not. i'm a bit close to home.}
<A>__{david lights one for himself.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i suppose cellists must go to a lot of concerts.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{we don't go to any concerts. we don't believe in them.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh, they're real.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{so people say.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why don't we believe in them?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i suppose...what would he say?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{your father, this is?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(darkly)}
<D>__{oh, yes. he'd say there's no point to them. they're just for fun. apart from school concerts, of course, which are no fun at all, so we go to those. the proper ones don't help you get on.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{which of course is what is so wonderful about them. anyway, you'll go one day.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(heartfelt)}
<D>__{yes. i will. i know. sometimes it seems as though that's what all this slog is for. if i get to university, i'm going to read what i want and think about what i want and listen to what i want. and i'm going to look at paintings and go to french films and talk to people who know lots about lots.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{good for you. which university?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oxford. if i'm lucky. did you go anywhere?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i studied at what i believe they call the university of life. and i didn't get a very good degree there.}
<A>__{jenny smiles.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{this is me. thank you.}
<A>__{she gets out of the car with the cello. david stares after her for a moment, then drives off.}
<L>__{interior jenny's sitting room. afternoon}
<A>__{jenny, her parents and graham are eating afternoon tea neat fish paste sandwiches, battenberg cake, best china.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{how's your mother, graham?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{she's fine, thanks. she sends her best, by the way.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{where are you applying, graham?}
<A>__{jenny looks embarrassed. she knows what's coming.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i'm not sure yet.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, when will you be sure? you can't let the grass grow under your feet, you know. otherwise you'll be at the back of the queue.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{i suppose so. i suppose the growing grass would knock you off balance, and then you'd fall over, and by the time you picked yourself up, there'd be a queue.}
<A>__{her father shoots her a look is she being cheeky?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i might take a year off.}
<A>__{jenny winces. jack looks at him as if he's just said he'll take all his clothes off.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe do some travelling, that sort of thing.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{travelling? what are you, a teddy boy?}
<A>__{close up of jenny she knows what's coming, and can't bear it. beat.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(nodding at jenny)}
<D>__{you know she's going to oxford, don't you? oxford. english. if we can get her latin up to scratch.}
<A>__{jenny sighs.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so she's studying english at oxford while you're a wandering jew... jenny looks at him curiously. graham steels himself to speak.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{mr mellor...i'm not a teddy boy. i'm an homme serieux. jeune. an homme jeune serieux homme. jenny winces again. her father stares at graham. graham blushes.}
<L>__{interior jenny's house. evening}
<D>__{it's the night of the youth orchestra concert. jenny, her mother and father are on their way out of the door. jack is carrying the cello. jenny is in her school uniform, with her hair scrubbed back in a severe ponytail. the three of them are flustered. jenny opens the front door for her father and he stumbles outside.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oh!}
<L>__{12a int exterior jenny's house. evening}
<D>__{she has seen something on the doorstep, and she stoops to pick it up a large bunch of flowers.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{they're for me!}
<C>__{marjorie}
<P>__{(curious)}
<D>__{who are they from? jenny opens the card that's attached to them.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{gosh. him.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{who's `him'?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{just...a chap i met.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{a chap who sends flowers? so he's a man chap?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yes, he is, really.}
<A>__{jack stares at the flowers in disbelief. the bunch of flowers has created in jack the kind of panic and fear more typically associated with a biochemical attack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's going on here?}
<C>__{marjorie}
<P>__{(drily, knowing the}
<D>__{trouble this will}
<P>__{cause)}
<D>__{jack,i'm afraid jenny has been sent some flowers by a chap.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{a chap? what kind of chap? who? why?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(patiently)}
<D>__{he's wishing me luck for tonight.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{are you sure that's all he's wishing? and where does he get the money from?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{he earns it, i expect.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what do you mean, he earns it? why isn't he at school? what does he do?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{can we just go? otherwise the bunch of good luck flowers will actually be responsible for me actually missing the concert. which would be ironic, n'est ce pas?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well i don't like it.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{objection noted. jenny?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{noted.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ten bob's worth of luck, i reckon. that's a lot for a schoolgirl. you can't leave them out here, anyway. i'd burgle a house that had flowers outside. they'll think we're made of money.}
<L>__{interior jenny's house. evening}
<D>__{jenny sighs, puts them inside the house, shuts the door.}
<L>__{interior coffee bar. day}
<D>__{jenny and two school friends, hattie and tina, are sitting at a table in a typical late 50s coffee bar, sipping cappuccinos. jenny is easily the most attractive of the three and also, we will see, possibly the cleverest. hattie is slower than the other two, and a lot frumpier; tina is pretty, and sharp rather than clever. she is also the least middle class of the three she's clearly a scholarship girl. they are all dressed in an unflattering and unambiguous school uniform no attempts to disguise it with more fashionable accessories. jenny is smoking pretentiously, and seems to be practising some kind of pout. tina starts to slurp the froth from her cappuccino with a spoon, inelegantly and noisily. jenny tuts her disapproval. tina sighs, and puts her spoon down.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{the whole point about him is that he doesn't feel.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{we still don't have to like him.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{camus doesn't want you to like him. what he's trying to say is that feeling is bourgeois. being engagee is bourgeois. his mother dies and he doesn't feel anything. he kills this arab and he doesn't feel anything.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{i wouldn't feel anything if my mother died. does that make me an existentialist?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{no. that just makes you a cow.}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{une vache.}
<A>__{laughter.}
<L>__{exterior street coffee bar. day}
<A>__{jenny, hattie and tina emerge from the cafe, talking.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{well i'm going to be french. i'm going to paris and i'm going to smoke and listen to jacques brel and wear black. and i won't speak. ever. c'est plus chic, comme...}
<A>__{she breaks off. parked outside a tobacconists on the other side of the road is the red bristol. she looks towards the shop, and david emerges with a copy of the times and a packet of cigars. jenny crosses the road to talk to him while the others watch.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{hello. thank you.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{how did it go?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oh, fine. i think. i mean, i didn't mess my bit up, anyway. and no one got thrown out of the orchestra afterwards.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{always the mark of a cultural triumph. listen. i'm glad i ran into you. what are you doing on friday?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{going to school.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i meant the evening.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{oh. yes. of course. nothing.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{because i'm going to listen to some schubert in st john's, smith square. my friends danny and helen will be going too, so it wouldn't be...i will tell you what. i will come and pick you up, and if your mother and father disapprove, then you can have the tickets and go with one of them. how does that sound?}
<A>__{jenny doesn't know what to say. she looks at david, and his eagerness to please seems to convince her.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{thank you. and i'd like you to take me. i'd like to go with someone who knows when to clap.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i usually watch danny. he knows that sort of thing.}
<A>__{jenny smiles.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{seven? and we'll probably go for a spot of supper afterwards, if you...but if you, if that's not...well, we can always put you in a taxi.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(flat disbelief)}
<D>__{supper.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{if you want.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{the trouble is, we'll already have eaten.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well. i mean, if you'd like supper, then, perhaps on friday you could...not eat?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(embarrassed again)}
<D>__{oh. yes. of course.}
<A>__{jenny smiles, and rejoins her friends on the other side of the road. tina and hattie are standing there almost with their mouths open, amazed. she doesn't say anything and starts to walk on.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i just had the strangest dream. i dreamed you crossed the road and spoke to a handsome man with the most beautiful car i've ever seen. and then you came back and you didn't mention it.}
<A>__{jenny smiles enigmatically. tina grabs jenny mock urgently.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{`oo wazzee?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(light, playful)}
<D>__{just a man who's been trying to pick me up. we're going to a concert on friday night. and then we're having a spot of supper.}
<C>__{tina}
<P>__{(shrieking)}
<D>__{a spot of supper?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you've heard of supper?}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{we've heard of it. but we've never eaten it.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{neither of you is interested in the concert part, i notice.}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{no. of course not.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{oh my god! i've only just realised! that's what's going to happen to you, isn't it? look at her! men are going to pick her up in the street and take her out to supper!}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{god, you're right, tina. i hadn't thought of that. look at her.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{don't be so daft.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{we're trying to attract the attention of boys. and she's fighting off men. anyway. you're going to have to tell us more than that.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{because no man's ever going to ask us out to supper. not until we're ladies, anyway. you're going to have to tell us everything. otherwise it's not fair.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{there won't be anything to tell.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{well, make something up, then.}
<L>__{interior jenny's house. evening}
<A>__{jenny is dressed up for her evening out. she looks good, but also stiff, uncomfortable she's not herself in her dress, which looks too old for her. her father is standing in front of her, shouting.}

<D>__{i won't allow it!}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{fine. he's quite happy for you to take me.}

<D>__{good.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{where is it?}

<D>__{st john's smith square.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{where's that?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm sure we could find out.}
<A>__{marjorie comes into the room.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{it's in westminster. just around the corner from the abbey.}
<A>__{jack looks at her as if she'd just given directions to the nearest opium den.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how d'you know that?}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{i had a life before we were married, you know.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{he soon put a stop to that.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{there we are.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{where are we?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{near westminster abbey. i'm not going all the way over there.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{the trouble is, that's where st john's smith square is.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and i've just said. that's where i'm not going. there must be something on locally. where's the paper?}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{jack, she wants to see someone who can play. she doesn't want to see sheila kirkland scratching away. i will take her.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and how are you going to get over there? raf helicopter?}
<A>__{the doorbell rings.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{that's him. now what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, bloody hell.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{jack!}
<A>__{jenny starts towards the door, and then turns.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oh, and by the way...david's a jew. a wandering jew. so watch yourself.}
<A>__{she goes to the door.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(panic stricken and shouting)}
<D>__{what's she talking about? i've never said anything like that in my life! anyway, it's just an expression! i'm not against the jews!}
<A>__{jenny comes back in with david, who is dressed stylishly in his early 60s young executive leisurewear sports jacket, slacks, cashmere sweater. he looks out of place he is brighter and brasher than his surroundings, the most colourful thing in the room, and he seems intimidatingly exotic. david has obviously heard jack's last line.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{i'm glad to hear it. hello. david goldman.}
<A>__{he offers his hand.}

<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{dad!}
<A>__{david's hand is still extended in his confusion and embarrassment, jack hasn't yet taken it. he does so now, and shakes it for way too long.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm sorry. what i'm saying is that you're not the sort of, of person i'd be against, if i were the sort of person who was against...people. you're not an old...oh, dear. i'm jack, and this is marjorie.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{you didn't tell me you had a sister, jenny.}
<A>__{general confusion, until david chuckles naughtily. marjorie giggles, and then offers her hand.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you're a lucky man, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i suppose i am, yes.}
<A>__{they all sit down.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, no, nothing...it was more of a question, really. how would you get to st john's smith square from here? for future reference?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh, it's a pretty straight run, really. up to hammersmith, take the a4 through kensington and you're there.}

<C>__{david}
<D>__{hello hello. are we late?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i was hoping we'd miss the beginning, and then it wouldn't be worth going in, and we could go off dancing or something.}

<A>__{she nods at the coat she's carrying. jenny looks thrilled at the prospect of spending a couple of minutes with helen. danny hands helen his coat, without saying anything. the girls walk over to another reception table a few yards away, behind which is a cloakroom. a lady is exchanging overcoats for tickets. almost involuntarily, jenny touches the sleeve of helen's velvety jacket. she stops herself. helen notices.}

<C>__{jenny}
<A>__{how are you going to "have it out" with her? what are you going to do? shout at her until she decides i'm much cleverer than she thinks?}
<C>__{marjorie}
<A>__{everyone's doing their best, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{what if their best isn't good enough, though, eh? what do we do then?}
<C>__{jenny}
<A>__{we don't go to oxford. any of us. not even you, dad.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{perhaps it's all a waste of time and money anyway.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<A>__{you don't mean that.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{well, what's she going to do with an english degree? and if she's going to spend three years playing that bloody cello and talking in french to beatniks, then i'm throwing good money after bad. i suppose she might meet a nice lawyer. but she could do that at a dinner dance tomorrow.}
<C>__{jenny}
<A>__{oh, yes. that's the whole point of an oxford education. it's the expensive alternative to a dinner dance.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<A>__{what about private tuition?}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{is anyone listening to me? how much is that going to cost me?}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{five shillings an hour. maybe a little more for a level.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{five bob! but... we could spend five bob on this and five bob on that, and before we know it that's our savings down the drain.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{and what else are we spending five bob on? what else are we spending sixpence on?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, nothing. (he gestures round the room.) it's all free. that vase was free.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{it was, actually. it was a present from auntie vi.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that chair was free. the sofa. we don't have to pay for anything. and even if we did, we don't have to work for it. that's the beauty of life, jenny. everything's free. grows on trees. wonderful, isn't it? (he warms to his theme, and grows}
<P>__{progressively more berserk.)}
<D>__{we've got a lovely oxford tree in the garden, lucky for you, so that's oxford taken care of. and a whole orchard of school trees, so that's all free. i'm sure there are some private tuition trees out there. i will go and have a look.}
<A>__{he stands up.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{jack...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, no, won't take me a minute. i think i saw some at the back there, right next to the pocket money tree. i will just nip out and check, see that they're doing all right. don't want anyone climbing over the wall and scrumping, do we? and you never know. maybe there'll be a man with deep pockets growing out there. because god knows we need to find you one. he leaves the room, apparently to look in the garden for the mythical trees.}

<C>__{david}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i think it means that if we never did anything, we wouldn't be anybody. and i never did anything before i met you. and sometimes i think no one's ever done anything in this stupid country, apart from you.}

<D>__{that's a good place to end the weekend. i will give you a tinkle.}

<A>__{jenny looks at her.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{where did you go?}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{sorry?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(louder, bolder)}
<D>__{where did you go? which university?}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{girton. cambridge.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{what does that mean? `oh'?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you're clever. and you're pretty. so presumably, clever miss stubbs won. and here you are, reading all those pony essays. i don't know. these last few months, i've been to paris, and to jazz clubs, and i've eaten in wonderful restaurants, and seen wonderful films, heard beautiful music...}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{i'm sure you have. but i was filled up with beautiful things, books and music and conversation, in exactly the same way at cambridge. and i didn't have to pay the same sort of price. are you taking precautions, jenny?}
<A>__{jenny stares at her angrily.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{it's nothing to do with that.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{isn't it?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{maybe our lives are always going to end up with pony essays. or housework. and yes, maybe we'll go up to oxford. but if we're all going to die the moment we graduate, maybe it's what we do before that counts.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{i'm sorry you think i'm dead.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i don't think you're dead. but...}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{you'd better get to your next class.}
<A>__{she turns her back on jenny.}
<L>__{exterior car. night}
<A>__{helen, danny, jenny get out of david's bristol, which is parked outside a nightclub called esmerelda's barn. david has parked next to a white rolls royce.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(looking at the rolls royce)}
<D>__{and we know the person who owns this?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes. perec rachman. he's a....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{a bastard.}
<A>__{danny and david laugh.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{he's a business acquaintance, and we need to talk to him.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i gathered that much. but why do we have to crawl around the west end looking for his car? why don't you just make an appointment, if you want to see him?}
<A>__{the men snigger.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what? ring his office? talk to his secretary? that isn't how it works with him, dear.}
<L>__{interior club. night}
<A>__{the four walk in and take their coats over to the cloakroom. the club is a smoky west end club, full of smartly dressed and dubious looking men, and young, glamorous, dubious looking women. jenny and helen look out of place helen too ethereal, jenny too innocent. there is jazz playing.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{there he is.}
<A>__{we see a nasty looking man in his late 30s early 40s. he is wearing a white sharksin suit and smoking a big cigar. he's standing by the roulette table, talking to an even nastier looking man in a dark suit. they find a table at the back and sit down. a waitress comes over to their table.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{a bottle of champagne, please.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{oh ho. champagne, eh?}
<A>__{he looks at jenny and david expectantly.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{don't be bashful.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no. be sneezy.}
<A>__{everyone ignores her.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{all right, then. if you won't tell them i will. jenny got two as and a b in her mock a levels.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{fantastic.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{congratulations.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the b was in latin. but it's much better than it was, isn't it, minnie?}
<A>__{rachman is now standing on his own. danny nudges david, and they go over to talk to him just as the champagne arrives. the waiter pops the bottle of champagne and pours two glasses. the girls smile and clink glasses.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{don't worry.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{someone told me that in fifty years no one will speak latin, probably. not even latin people. so you shouldn't mind too much about your b.}
<A>__{jenny stares at her, trying to think of a response.}
<L>__{interior club. night}
<A>__{danny and david are at the bar, having just finished talking to rachman. danny puffs out his cheeks and shakes his head.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{well, i'm not sure you'd want him to marry your sister. i'm not even sure you'd want to talk to him in a night club, come to that.}
<A>__{they both chuckle. there is a silence for a moment.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{you do know what you're doing, old chap? with jenny?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{this is the one, danny.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{we've heard that before.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you can see she's different. she's got everything. you've got helen, and....}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(drily)}
<D>__{and you've got helen with brains.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(rumbled)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i don't want to see her hurt.}
<A>__{they make their way back to their table.}
<L>__{interior club. night}
<A>__{while david and helen watch, danny and jenny dance. danny's a good dancer; jenny is nervous at first, but becomes more comfortable and more expressive, with danny's help.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(knowing that she should}
<D>__{make conversation, as all the couples around}
<P>__{her are doing)}
<D>__{have you...have you bought any more paintings recently?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{have i? let's think? oh, i picked up a little piper the other day. a good `un, i think.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i'm still trying to work out what makes good things good. it's hard, isn't it?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{the thing is, jenny, you know, without necessarily being able to explain why. you've got taste. that's not even half the battle. that's the whole war.}
<A>__{jenny smiles at him with gratitude. there is a sudden closeness between them. david is watching them carefully. they return to their table.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{jenny, we should go. it's late.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{oh. yes.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{alas. one day, school will be over forever, and we can talk about art all night.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(to danny)}
<D>__{you're all right in a taxi, aren't you?}
<A>__{he guides jenny firmly out of the club.}
<L>__{exterior club. night.}
<A>__{jenny is about to to open the passenger door of the bristol, but david stops her.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{wait there.}
<A>__{he runs to the back of the car, opens the boot and starts rummaging through it. it seems to be full of everything but the thing he's looking for.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{he slams the boot shut and comes back empty handed.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{will you marry me?}
<A>__{jenny stares at him for a moment, then laughs.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what were you looking for?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i thought i had a ring. it wouldn't have been the right one. but it would have done for tonight.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(eyes twinkling with amusement)}
<D>__{oh, david.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm serious.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you're very sweet.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(helplessly)}
<D>__{please take me home.}
<A>__{she gets into the car. we see the desperation in david's face, lit by the headlights of a passing taxi, as he slams the door on jenny after she's got in.}
<L>__{exterior school yard. day}
<A>__{jenny, tina and hattie all smoking in the school toilets. jenny is distracted, and standing apart from the others. tina looks at her.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{how do you say `a penny for your thoughts?' in french?}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{a franc is too much, isn't it?}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{for her thoughts, yes. you'd be overpaying by about ninety nine centimes.}
<A>__{suddenly the door bursts open and the latin teacher comes in.}
<L>__{interior head's office. day}
<A>__{the three girls are lined up in front of the headmistress, hands by their sides.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{i'm surprised that you two are standing in front of me. i'm not surprised to find you here, miss mellor, though i do feel rather like the judge who sent al capone to prison for tax evasion. we take a very dim view of smoking. we take an even dimmer view of some of your other behaviour, which as far as we know has taken place off school premises. your appearance here today, however, allows me to remind you that we are trying to teach you how to become young ladies, not nightclub hostesses. in reality, of course, you are neither. you are merely silly little girls. detention after school. go away. jenny's face sets hard. something in her shuts down.}
<L>__{exterior jenny's balcony. evening}
<D>__{jenny is smoking on the balcony.}
<L>__{interior jenny's bedroom.}
<D>__{jenny is at her desk in her bedroom, trying to work, but she can't concentrate. her hair is tied back in a pony tail. she gets up, pulls back the curtains, looks out of the window. we see what she sees: a sleepy suburban street at night. she looks back at her desk. it looks even more boring than the street. she looks at her scrubbed seventeen year old face in the mirror so much younger than the jenny we have seen with david. she makes herself up, and she gets older and more glamorous before our eyes. in her make up and her school uniform, she's half woman, half child. we hear the noises drifting up from the kitchen: the radio, the washing up, occasional muffled conversation. jenny walks out of the bedroom and slips downstairs.}
<L>__{interior kitchen. evening}
<D>__{jenny's mother and father are doing the washing up and listening to the radio. they have their backs to the door. jenny enters the room quietly and watches them for a moment}
<C>__{man on the radio}
<D>__{they do need some looking after, but nothing that will require too much work. just leave them in your potting shed for a couple of weeks, and they'll look after themselves.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, aye. the potting shed. who does he think i am? prince rainier of monaco?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what if i got married instead of going to college? jack and marjorie turn around and stare at this strange apparition wearing too much make up and a school uniform.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{married?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{married.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it would depend who it was, surely?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{would it? that's interesting.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{course it would. i wouldn't want you married off just for the sake of it.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{has somebody asked you?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{who?}
<A>__{marjorie rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{what did you tell him?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{nothing yet.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{david?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{no. a man i just met walking his dog.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{david's asked you to marry him? bloody hell. pardon my french.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{do you have any choice? or is it too late.}
<A>__{she looks at her daughter knowingly. jack merely looks confused.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{of course she's got a choice. but it's an interesting one, isn't it?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{this is where you're supposed to say, "but what about oxford?"}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well. looked at it one way, you wouldn't really need to go now, would you? he's a man going places. and say what you like, but they know how to take care of their money, don't they? he'll see you're looked after.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(quietly, turning the}
<D>__{words over in her}
<P>__{mouth)}
<D>__{i wouldn't need to go. would you like to expand on that?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<A>__{jenny laughs bitterly. she can't believe it.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{all that latin! all those essays! what was the point? why didn't you just send me out prowling round nightclubs? it would have been less trouble. and i might have had more fun.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we don't know about nightclubs. we knew about education. anyway, it all turned out for the best.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he wouldn't have wanted you if you were thick, would he?}
<A>__{jenny stares at them and walks out.}
<L>__{interior classroom. day}
<A>__{english. miss stubbs is standing at the front of the class, holding a copy of king lear, and listening as various members of the class massacre the texterior some are messing about by overacting; others read to the best of their ability, tonelessly and with no understanding of the words. lear himself is being read by ann, the bespectacled girl from the first scene. she's no king lear, and she's one of the bad readers.}
<C>__{girl 1}
<D>__{may not an ass know when the cart draws the horse? sings whoop jug i love thee.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{yes, when it says `sings', it means he sings those words.}

<D>__{never mind. lear...}
<C>__{ann}

<D>__{no.}
<A>__{jenny starts to giggle.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{speak thus?}
<A>__{tina shakes her head.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{where are his eyes?}
<A>__{tina doesn't need to say anything she just looks at jenny, makes a pair of spectacles with her fingers and squints. jenny's giggling fit increases in intensity.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{either his notion weakens, or his discernings are lethargied. ha! waking? tis not so. who is it that can tell me who i am?}
<A>__{jenny's arm shoots up, as if to answer the question.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{ooh. miss. me. i can.}
<A>__{miss stubbs looks at jenny more in sorrow than in anger jenny's behaviour now is something new in their relationship. jenny stares back at her defiantly. suddenly miss stubbs notices something glinting on her hand: an engagement ring.}

<D>__{oh, jenny.}
<A>__{she is, as she promised she would be, heartbroken.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{take it off.}
<A>__{hattie, who is sitting behind jenny, notices the ring, too, for the first time.}

<D>__{oh my god. is that really what i think it is? i'm going to be a bridesmaid!}
<A>__{there is an excited susurration in the classroom.}

<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{half the girls in this room are wearing jewelry.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}

<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(coolly)}

<A>__{jenny doesn't move.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}

<A>__{the headmistress stares at her, dumbfounded.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{jewish? he's a jew? you're aware, i take it, that the jews killed our lord?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(beginning to feel less}

<D>__{and you're aware, i suppose, that our lord was jewish?}
<A>__{the headmistress snorts scornfully}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{i suppose he told you that. we're all very sorry about what happened in the war. but there's no excuse for that sort of malicious and untruthful propaganda.}
<A>__{jenny smiles to herself.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{anyway, i can now see that you are even more in need of responsible advice than i realised. is it true that you don't intend to sit for your exams? and therefore you won't be applying for university?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yes, that's right.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{what do you think you're doing?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{nobody has been able to explain to me the point of university. therefore i don't see the point of the exams, either.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{nobody does anything worth doing without a degree.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{and nobody does anything worth doing with one, either. no woman, anyway.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{so what i do isn't worth doing. or what miss stubbs does, or mrs wilson, or any of us here.}
<A>__{jenny doesn't say anything. the headmistress takes her silence as an admission of defeat.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{because none of us would be here without our degrees, you realise that, don't you? and yes, of course studying is hard, and boring, and...}
<A>__{jenny can't contain herself any longer.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{boring!}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{studying is hard and boring. teaching is hard and boring. so you're telling me to be bored, and then bored, and then finally bored again, this time for the rest of my life. this whole stupid country is bored. there's no life in it, or colour in it, or fun in it. it's probably just as well that the russians are going to drop a nuclear bomb on us any day now. so my choice is either to do something hard and boring, or to marry my... my jew, and go to paris and rome and listen to jazz and read and eat good food in nice restaurants and have fun. it's not enough to educate us any more, mrs walters. you've got to tell us why you're doing it.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{because without formal qualifications...}
<A>__{she grinds to a halt. she has never had to answer this question before.}
<C>__{headmistress}

<A>__{jenny stands up.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i don't wish to be impertinent, mrs walters. but it is an argument worth rehearsing. you never know. someone else might want to know what the point of it all is, one day.}

<A>__{jenny is half walking, half running, towards the school gates. she's scared, of course, but exhilarated, too. all that pressure, and all those years of education, suddenly over, unexpectedly, and certainly unceremoniously. she looks neither left nor right, but other girls, younger girls, watch her through the windows as she leaves. jenny doesn't even look round when she goes through the school gates.}
<L>__{interior kitchen. evening}

<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i'm sure david will pay you back. send him a bill. as you said, he wouldn't have wanted me if i was dim, so he should fork out. just tell me why there's a point in sitting my exams, and there's no point in me going to university.}
<A>__{jack gapes at her. he's floundering.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you know what your trouble is, don't you? you're too clever by half.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{in which case i should have left school years ago, shouldn't i? ask them for the money back. if i'm too clever by half, you overpaid by a third.}

<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{you have to put the cosy on straight away. jenny sighs and rolls her eyes. she picks up the hand knitted tea cosy and puts it on her head.}

<D>__{god almighty. what have i done?}
<A>__{jenny opens the glove compartment, looking for the cigarettes that david always keeps there. she finds the cigarettes, and closes the glove compartment. but she has seen something in there, so she opens it again. she takes out some letters and papers and starts to look through them.}

<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{go inside, dad. jenny and david watch jack and marjorie go into the house. the moment the door is closed, jenny walks towards david. she's holding a bunch of letters that she took out of the glove compartment. she starts to throw them at him, one by one.}

<D>__{mr and mrs david goldman, mr and mrs david goldman, mr and mrs david goldman, mr and mrs david goldman.. when she has thrown the last one, she flies at david she slaps him, punches him, scratches him. david tries to grab her hands, but she's too wild.}

<D>__{when were you going to tell me?}
<C>__{david}

<C>__{david}

<D>__{i owe them a lot more than that. i owe them everything. they gave me you.}
<A>__{he opens the boot. it's full of cases of whiskey. jenny doesn't even bother asking what they are doing there. david takes one of the bottles, opens it, takes a long slug.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{two minutes. and then i will come out and drag you in. jenny marches into the house and slams the door. the camera stays on david. he gets back into the car and takes another slug of whiskey. then his shoulders begin to shake, and he cries and cries.}
<L>__{interior jenny's house. night}
<D>__{jenny comes in, leaving the door open for david. her parents are standing in the sitting room, looking at her anxiously. their coats are still on, and they haven't put the lights on yet.}

<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{he's helping himself to some dutch courage before facing you. stolen dutch courage, from the look of it. he has something to tell you. she stands, pale and young looking again, opposite her parents. suddenly they are all three lit up by headlights. shot from their pov of the bristol roaring off up the street.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he just drove off. we close slowly in on jenny's face. but of course he'd drive off!}
<C>__{jack}

<A>__{the woman deposits the child in the drive, goes back into the house, comes out behind an enormous 1950s pram. david has found time to father another baby.}

<P>__{(almost inaudible)}

<D>__{four months!}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{yes. babies often are that sort of age. perhaps you can remember a night four months ago when he seemed a little distracted. anyway. if you'll excuse us. she pushes past jenny and leaves her standing bereft on the path.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{all my life i've been scared, and i didn't want you to be scared. that's why i wanted you to go to oxford. so that if someone asked you out to a nice restaurant, you wouldn't panic about what was a starter and what was a main course. and then david came along, and he had money, and he knew famous writers, and he knew how to get to classical music concerts. but he wasn't who he said he was. he wasn't who you said he was, either.}

<D>__{jenny has put on her school uniform for this meeting; it completes a circle. she's back where she started from, or would like to be, anyway. if she seems older than she did when we first met her, it's because things have happened to her, and they've left a mark on her face. she's worried and tired. the headmistress, meanwhile, is delighted by her return but only because of the opportunities for smugness and schadenfreude it provides.}

<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{i'm afraid i think you're the sort of young lady who attracts chaps whether she wants to or not. no,i think the offer of a place at this school would be wasted on you. you showed how little you valued us only weeks ago. and i must confess that it gives me a sort of grim satisfaction to return the sentiment now.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(bitterly)}

<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{it gives me no pleasure to see our schoolgirls throw their lives away. although, of course, you're not one of our schoolgirls any more. through your own volition.}

<D>__{eighteen months later. swelling orchestral music. close on jenny cycling, absorbed, happy, the cello strapped to her precariously. the camera pulls back to show her cycling through the streets of oxford. she's done it. we follow her for a little while. she dismounts outside a church and leans the bike against a wall. just as she's about to leave it, she sees something and freezes. we follow her gaze: it's the red bristol, parked a little way down the road just in front of her. she scans the street to see if she can find david. she can he's coming round a corner, a littler further down the street, unwrapping a packet of cigarettes. jenny moves into his eye line. he sees her, stops, then walks towards her.}

<D>__{look, david. i'm in oxford. every day i wake up and pinch myself. and when i think how close i came...}
<A>__{she looks at him and shakes her head, as if awaking from a dream. a young man stops behind her on his bike, dismounts, leans his bike against the wall next to hers, waits for her to finish. she turns her back on david, and the young man offers her his arm. they walk away together, and david stares longingly after them.}
