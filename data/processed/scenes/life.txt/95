<A>__{jangle leg pitches to radio, who swings and misses. behind the plate, goldmouth tosses the ball back to jangle leg. on the sideline, ray teaches three card monte to can't get right. claude paces nearby.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i try to teach 'em the finer points of the game, share my wisdom, but i don't know why i bother. they don't listen, they sure don't learn...}
<A>__{another pitch, another strike.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i'm sick of watching camp 12 win the championship. every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. this year i want that pig.}
<A>__{radio knocks a grounder up the middle.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{alright, radio, there you go. who wants to hit next?}
<A>__{can't get right looks at ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you want to hit?}

<D>__{can't be worse than any of these other fools.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{all right, grab the bat. let's see what you can do.}
<A>__{can't get right shuffles to the plate. goldmouth hands him the bat.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{jangle leg's gonna throw the ball nice and easy. you just go ahead and take a swing.}
<A>__{jangle leg tosses the ball. can't get right swings and connects with a mighty crack! the incorrigibles crane their necks as the ball disappears into the sky. they turn to look at can't get right. ray gives claude a significant look, then tosses another ball out to jangle leg on the mound.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{okay. let's try that again. this time give it a little juice.}
<A>__{jangle leg nods, winds up and delivers a whistling fast ball. can't get right clobbers it. once again, the incorrigibles track the departing projectile.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{told ya.}
<A>__{can't get right smiles for the first time.}
