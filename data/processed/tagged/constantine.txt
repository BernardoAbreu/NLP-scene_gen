<L>__{exterior istanbul dusk}
<A>__{glimpses of an ancient city. almost motionless against the tide of time. sea swelled along an endless wall. billowing silk frozen against the sky. birds lighting on byzantine columns. final image is of an imposing structure beyond the trees.}
<L>__{interior prison for the criminally insane}
<A>__{corridor of ancient stone and steel extends into infinite darkness. stale air hangs in the dim half light like atomized ether. there is whispering. and tangled voices. drift in past prison cells the size of closets. brief flashes of carved faces, insanity coming to rest on the }
<B>__{final cell}
<A>__{a gaunt prisoner kneels on the granite, head bowed to a wall hung tapestry of christ. but he's not just praying. he's digging. with his arm under the tapestry, he scratches at the stone with a spoon. after only a year, the spoon finally breaks through.}
<L>__{interior narrow channel}
<A>__{prisoner claws his way between ancient walls, comes to a dead end against a thick wooden door. he nudges a shoulder against it, digs in and pushes. door groans open, sucking air into the pitch black chamber.}
<L>__{interior prisoner's cell}
<A>__{the tapestry covering the hole is pulled against the wall, then billows outward like a sail.}
<L>__{interior chamber prisoner}
<A>__{pulls himself inside, chokes in the heavy air. he scans the musty room. antique furniture. a few empty crates. and the remains of several deteriorating skeletons. he looks to the far wall, sees a hint of light above through the crumbling limestone. a way out. too high to reach, prisoner pulls an old chest out of a cobwebbed corner and slides it under the light. he steps up onto the chest, grabs the edges of the hole and starts to shove off when the top of the chest gives way and his foot crunches through. prisoner reaches down to free his foot when he sees something inside wrapped in a red cloth. he pulls it out and as he unwraps it, he discovers the cloth is a nazi flag. at the center is a crudely shaped iron relic. eight inches long. stains on the edges. could be the petrified tooth of some prehistoric animal. or maybe an ancient arrowhead. as he holds it, feverish sweat starts to form on his face.}
<B>__{mysterious pov}
<A>__{from behind. as if he's being watched by someone else. prisoner spins, looks back at us. nothing.}
<B>__{prisoner}
<A>__{starts toward the way out.}

<L>__{interior narrow channel}
<A>__{prisoner squeezes toward light, grips the relic tight.}

<C>__{guards}
<P>__{(in turkish)}
<D>__{stop! stop!}
<A>__{prisoner spins, griping the relic tight. gunshots ring out. bullets streak toward him but never hit their target. guards check their weapons on the run.}
<L>__{exterior near a road night}
<A>__{prisoner breaks from the trees, runs into a road. headlights wash over him and tires screech. prisoner spins, is right in the path of a car. brakes squeal car locks up but too late impacts prisoner who is violently thrown and lands in a heap. car slides to a stop. driver jumps out, sees the front end sheet metal has accordioned all the way to the tires. he scans the area for a body, spots the prisoner and is stunned to see him getting to his feet. uninjured. prisoner is just as amazed. he glances at the relic in his hand, notes the wrist has reddened and an odd symbol has appeared as if embossed in the flesh. driver calls out but the prisoner is spooked, runs off. over this we hear a child's scream.}
<L>__{interior apartment day}
<A>__{father hennessey (50), stands over a young teen (13), jeanie, splashes holy water on her body. she screams again.}

<A>__{her body convulses, pulls against the bandages tying her hands and feet to the bed frame. notice her fingernails. drained of color. almost black. her mother is off to one side, completely hysterical. on the other side is a crowd of bewildered tenants, all crammed into the hallway outside the opened door. nothing can compare with an exorcism. especially one that's gone bad. the rather obese priest tries to steady his hands and his heart. it's obvious he's totally out of his league here. girl lets out another scream that echoes over }
<L>__{exterior aging apartment building}
<A>__{not in a third world country but smack center in one of america's richest cities. sparkling high rises tower in the distance while flashy billboards tout the sexiest fashions, the hottest automobiles and the smoothest malt liquor. superimpose: los angeles today}
<L>__{exterior alley by the apartment}
<A>__{a faded yellow taxi pulls up and stops. someone steps out, grinds a cigarette butt into the asphalt.}
<L>__{interior apartment building foyer}
<A>__{doors open, flood the musty darkness with a brief relief of sunlight. a man whose face we don't see steps inside, his trench coat hanging like the folded wings of a raven. he pauses, pulls an ornate lighter and lights a cigarette. takes a puff and pushes on inside.}
<L>__{interior narrow staircase hall wall}
<A>__{lined with tenants trying to get a glimpse of the unexplainable. the stranger pushes through. suspicious faces step out of his path. the ones that don't he pushes aside even the gangbangers. the man has no patience for politeness, no time for tact, no fear of anything. this man is john constantine. he arrives at his destination, barges into }

<C>__{hennessey}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{thank god you're here...}
<A>__{john shoots him a disgusted look. hennessey gives him a wide berth. john walks past the panic stricken mother without a glance, sets his cigarette on the nightstand, the glowing tip drooped over the edge. he puts a gloved hand to the child's face and it burns on contact. his demeanor instantly changes as he leans right next to the ear of the little girl and whispers }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{this is constantine. john constantine, asshole.}
<A>__{the girl jolts, bandages on her arms cut into her skin. eyes snap open glare right through him.}
<C>__{john}

<A>__{john whips out a key chain crammed with medallions.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{let's see who we got here...}
<A>__{he holds them up so they cast shadows across jeanie's face. he flips through each of these sculptured saints until the child suddenly reacts to one tries to look away. john stares at the saint responsible, seems genuinely puzzled. he turns to the mother very serious.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i need a mirror. now.}
<A>__{shaken, the mother produces a small compact. john pushes it away, turns to the doorway crowd.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{a large mirror. at least }
<P>__{(sizes up the child)}
<D>__{ three feet high.}
<A>__{the hallway crowd discusses possibilities.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{move.}
<A>__{tenants run to retrieve a mirror. hennessey looks worried. john grabs the bed shoves hennessey aside as he swings the bed around, legs gouging hardwood all the way. faces it toward the window.}

<A>__{ apartment 5g below several of the men from the hallway crowd storm through an old woman's stuffy apartment, locate a huge iron framed mirror and rip it and half the plaster from the wall.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{chaz?}
<A>__{chaz (20s) looks up from his cab. cool. frustrated. you just know he'd love to be up there, not down here.}

<D>__{there, i moved the damn car.}
<L>__{interior hallway}
<A>__{four men struggle to carry up that enormous mirror. the old woman follows, begs them to be gentle. they swing the mirror around, take out a chunk of banister. she freaks.}
<L>__{interior apartment 7b}
<A>__{hennessey can only watch as john threads the drapery rope through the fire escape railing, drapes it back through the window and loops it over the ceiling fan. he climbs onto the bed, leans over the child whose eyes have closed and she's shaking badly. her body seems to be going into shock. isn't strong enough for this. john has no choice slaps her. eyes pop back open. dark and dilated. he yells down at her in aramaic and english.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{amar natash bow basar! rescind from the flesh i command thee }
<A>__{the girl chokes as if ready to spit.}
<C>__{john}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{amar natash bow basar }
<A>__{another pulse and this time a shape is clearly seen expanding under the child's skin as if the demon inside were trying to burst right through. john backs off watches as the shape ripples her flesh, like fingers caressing from the other side. john glances to hennessey. what the hell? mirror arrives at the doorway, bangs against the jam. john waves them in. the four men heft it into the room.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{lift it. over the bed. up.}
<A>__{john ducks, settles on the girl as they raise it over him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hennessey, tie it off }
<A>__{hennessey is glad to be called into service quickly ties one end of rope to the mirror. john straddles the girl, positions his head between her and the mirror above him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{now close your eyes all of you and whatever happens do not look into the mirror.}
<A>__{the men close their eyes. muscles tense under the weight.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{amar natash bow basar! rescind from the flesh i command thee!}
<A>__{jeanie reacts that shape reappears, contorts the young body all out of proportion. john unblocks the mirror for a second and jeanie is reflected inside. it's not just the image of a young girl in there, but something else. the surface of the mirror flexes in the hands of the men. one starts to look }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{jeanie screams breaks free of the straps. she rises up, grabs john tight around the throat. nails dig deep.}
<C>__{hennessey}
<D>__{john?!}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(looking into mirror)}
<D>__{not yet!}
<A>__{john struggles, puts his hands over her mouth cutting off her air supply. question is, who's going to pass out first? jeanie's body is racked by whatever's inside her. she goes into shock, body collapsing shaking close to death.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{look! look at me!}
<A>__{but she's passing out first. john quickly takes the medallion that caused the earlier reaction }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{goddamit look!}
<A>__{ and presses it against her forehead. eyes snap wide and john unblocks the mirror. jeanie locks on her reflection and the image in the mirror changes drastically.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{smile pretty you vain prick.}
<A>__{the child's reflection has now changed to a pissed off demon. one that knows it just got suckered in. mirror vibrates wildly in the men's grip. demon reflection ripples the glass bending it outward into three d space as the girl takes her last breaths }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{now, hennessey. now!}
<A>__{hennessey pulls the rope with all three hundred plus pounds as john gives the demon face a full extended}
<B>__{finger.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{for your boss.}
<A>__{demon pushes for him but mirror is jerked into motion. swings right out the window but catches on a sliver of wood }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no you don't.}
<A>__{john jumps up and helps push the mirror free.}
<L>__{exterior apartment building huge mirror}
<A>__{falls slow motion from the 7th story tumbling end over end, sunlight beams glancing off the glass, projecting the image of the demon into the la cityscape. onto buildings, sidewalks, a passing truck until all three hundred pounds of iron and glass come crashing down on the taxi's hood.}
<C>__{chaz}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{demon's image shatters on impact glass splintering into a million diamond like fragments that choke the air. the groan of something evil reverberates into the city beyond. chaz looks up, sees he missed dying by three feet.}
<L>__{interior apartment continuous action}
<A>__{jeanie gasps takes her first breath as a child again. and cries. mother pulls her in, hugs her tight. note the girl's fingernails. no longer black. john's beat, reclaims that stub of a cigarette, still burning. takes a drag. he pushes past hennessey who is approaching the mother.}
<C>__{hennessey}
<D>__{now about the fee...}
<A>__{john slips from view into the kitchenette, hides the fact that he has to lean against the door to keep his balance. he catches his breath, looks up and is staring right at a child's crayon drawing magneted to the fridge. a drawing of a figure poking another in the side with a long stick. this image is repeated over and over. john tugs it off the fridge, tucks it away.}
<L>__{interior apartment building stairwell later}
<A>__{hennessey follows john down the spiraling stairs, passing the gathered tenants. a few are freaked, cross themselves. others horrified. but many want to touch them, shake their hands. a shadowy figure several floors up stares over the rail at the heroes below. note the slick suit, the polished veneer. this is balthazar and he definitely does not rent here. he flicks an ancient coin between his fingers. john pauses, gazes up through the stairwell as if sensing something. no one there. balthazar is gone. john shakes off the feeling, continues down the steps where hennessey is shoving his hat in front of the tenants. they're gladly giving to the cause.}
<C>__{hennessey}
<D>__{thank you. yes... gracias...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hennessey.}
<A>__{hennessey stops his panhandling, continues toward the exit.}
<L>__{interior foyer}
<A>__{john and hennessey stop near the front entrance. john rips the white collar from hennessey's neck.}
<C>__{hennessey}
<D>__{i know, i know, but i didn't think she was really possessed, not like that.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm not back an hour and you drag me into }

<D>__{ don't be mad, john, don't be }

<D>__{don't do that shit on me }
<C>__{hennessey}
<D>__{sorry, sorry. here, you can have half.}
<A>__{hennessey starts to divvy the cash but john snatches the hat.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i should take it all, save you from yourself.}
<A>__{he gestures that bagged bottle in hennessey's jacket.}
<C>__{hennessey}
<D>__{it keeps them out, so i can sleep. please, john, i need to sleep.}
<A>__{john stares at his pathetic friend, sighs, finally slips a few bills from the wad and hands them over. hennessey is bubbling with appreciation, starts to follow. john simply holds up a hand. hennessey stops, watches john walk out. alone.}
<L>__{exterior alley by the apartment}
<A>__{john turns the corner, spots chaz punching a dent from the taxi's hood.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i told you to move it.}
<C>__{chaz}
<D>__{well maybe if you had told me you were dropping a three hundred pound mirror with a pissed off demon in it i would have moved it further.}
<A>__{chaz slams the hood. they slide into the car.}
<C>__{chaz}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{well what?}
<A>__{chaz reaches back into john's front coat pocket pulls out hennessey's wad of cash slips off a few bills.}
<C>__{chaz}
<D>__{shouldn't have cut your stay in the land of enlightenment. you were so close to growing a conscience.}
<A>__{john grins, pulls his special lighter, lights a smoke and sits back.}

<D>__{los angeles...}
<A>__{he looks back up at the apartment, still puzzled.}
<C>__{john}

<L>__{interior subway day}
<A>__{angela's (30) weary eyes open. she's on her belly hidden between track ties and shadows even deeper. grips a police issue revolver tight. she's pinned down, unable to move.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{the man is thirty feet down the same track. their voices echo off the curved walls, come from everywhere. how either of these two got here isn't important. who will get out is.}

<A>__{intermittent radio chatter buzzes from angela's walkie talkie. you get the sense angela is not alone in here.}

<D>__{put your weapon on the tracks and step out with your hands above your head.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{or how 'bout you show yourself and i put a bullet in your skull just like i did hers!}

<C>__{man }
<D>__{well ain't this a peach?!}
<A>__{angela looks back, sees several shadows of figures waving far off. her radio is flooded with futzed chatter.}
<C>__{detective weiss }
<P>__{(over radio)}
<D>__{get off the tracks! blueline is coming! clear the tracks!}
<A>__{angela peeks over the track. still no sign of her perp. the train is coming into view and its beam shoots through the tunnel, turning every particle of dust into a supernova. the sound is deafening.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{c'mon, detective, step into the light and be saved!!}
<A>__{angela looks back, squints into the brilliant light. she grips her gun and in one burst of flat out bravado rises as she aims. and there he is the man rising with his own gun. angela fires as both dive off the track. his bullet ricochets behind her. hers finds its mark. man goes down right in the train's path. angela rolls over on the side of the tracks, catches her breath. she closes her eyes and crosses herself as the train roars past in a staccato blur.}

<A>__{john walks in. chaz curses under his breath.}
<L>__{interior 20 lanes bowling alley}
<A>__{evening leagues are going strong. john walks in, looks totally out of place. he moves down the ball rack area, runs his fingers across the various leftovers, finally stops at a pearl white dazzler. he lifts it from the rack, steps out into the prep area in front of one of the few lanes not in use. number 13. john snatches a grease pencil from the overhead, scribbles right on the ball "provisions depleted." he fluffs his trench coat back, steps onto the polished wood with his well traveled oxfords. young bowlers on both sides stop to look at this oddity. an attractive brunette is rather curious. john gives her a wink. her boyfriend doesn't appreciate it. john bowls. perfect hook ball. strike! brunette grins. john returns the smile, heads into the hallway by the pool tables.}
<L>__{interior john's apartment}
<A>__{seems small until you walk in and realize it's as long as a bowling lane. makes that cage enclosed bed at one end seem like it's a mile away. chaz throws the suitcases on it as john arrives.}
