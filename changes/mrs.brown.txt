Slowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on him that he is alone.  He stares at the thrashing trees, waving their mocking arms at him.  His hand lets the pistol drop to his side.  He feels the rain drench down his face. And now, for the first time, we see that his socks have fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds.  He shifts a foot.  His dress-shoes are covered in mud.  He goes on staring into the dark.  Nothing. Just the wind and rain.  Gradually, we pull back, higher and higher.  As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice:}

The tune is some quaint Scottish ballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice, almost drowning out PRINCE ARTHUR, PRINCE LOUISE and PRINCE LEOPOLD who are meant to be accompanying her.  They stand in a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies. Ignoring them completely, VICTORIA bobs up her head with a quizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated. DISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards off, smiling rigidly.  DISRAELI, the consummate politician to his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them.  This man is in raptures of delight.  And the more liquid his smiles, the happier he makes VICTORIA.  He beams, she belts, until her children are drowned out completely. And then, with characteristic suddenness, VICTORIA stops playing and launches into one of her tirades.  The HOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back, but DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern.}
