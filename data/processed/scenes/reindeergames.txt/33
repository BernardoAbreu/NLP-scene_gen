<L>__{interior motel room night}
<A>__{pitch dark. rudy fumbles his way in:}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{...but i got a girl to be with, rum pum pum pum...}
<C>__{merlin }
<D>__{hi, nick.}
<A>__{rudy drops the shopping bags, whirls around, as a stocky black shadow, merlin, all 280 pounds of him, kicks the door shut }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{what the fuck }
<A>__{ and swings a baseball bat toward rudy's chest. rudy gets an arm down to deflect the blow, but it still stings like a mother. rudy howls. merlin comes at him again and this time rudy slips by. merlin's bat shatters a dresser. rudy grabs him by the neck, kicks out his knees and wrests him to the ground. grabs the bat and gets decked from behind by another shadow, pug, a little white guy with a snarl. they go crashing onto the bed, grappling for leverage, and then to the floor where rudy grabs a champagne bottle from the groceries and bashes it backwards, shattering it over pug's head! pug lets go, as rudy scrambles up, and merlin's got him again in a bear hug. rudy's struggling, whirling with him, crashing into one wall, then another, yelling for help }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{heyyy!!! in here!!! heyyy!!!}
<A>__{ until he hears the pump load snap of a shotgun. rudy stops still. a lamp clicks on. standing in silhouette, a figure in a leather duster holds a sawed off on him.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{welcome home, nick.}
<A>__{another lamp comes on. rudy, still in merlin's choke hold, gets a look at the gunman, gabriel. weathered face, stringy hair, early 30's. handsome in a scuzzy way. he's seen a lot of road. rudy stares, totally thrown. pug, the little guy, bad teeth, bad hair, bad skin, gets up spitting blood and champagne.}
<C>__{pug}
<D>__{i owe ya a drink, ya fuck }
<A>__{ and slugs rudy in the gut. merlin yanks him back up. merlin's a black widebody, wears a goatee and brass knuckles. behind merlin stands a fourth intruder, a stone faced indian in a grateful dead longsleeve. jumpy. guarding the door. gabriel's studying rudy, up and down. nods. merlin relaxes his choke hold so rudy can breathe.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you... you don't know me }
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{oh, i know you, nick. i know you real well.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{no, you can't }
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{the hell i can't.}
<A>__{as the room's door gets kicked open }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{watch out, baby! i'm bringing in the fucking tree!}
<A>__{and the silver fake evergreen fills the doorway, getting forced through with ashley's grunts and groans }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{ashley!}
<A>__{merlin traps his jaw shut. the tree comes squeezing through, followed by ashley, face in branches }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i'm telling you, we got the best one in the store... i don't know why people want their houses smelling like the stupid woods...}
<A>__{she's grabbed from behind by jumpy. ashley screams, but he slams her against the wall. the tree hits the ground.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{nick!}
<A>__{rudy fights to help her, but merlin's got him. pug locks ashley's arms. she fights, muffled cries, but jumpy and pug have her held firmly. her face to the wall }
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(re: the silver tree)}
<D>__{hope her taste in men's better than her taste in christmas.}
<A>__{ashley's turned to face him. her eyes widen. gabriel nods.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{hey, sis. happy holidays.}
<A>__{rudy's jaw drops. he looks to ashley. then to gabriel. ashley yells, enraged, kicking and clawing. jumpy slams her back against the wall for her trouble }
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{jumpy, don't hurt her, now.}
<A>__{gabriel steps to rudy. studies him.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{so. this is the guy you been waiting for. man of your dreams.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{gabriel !}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(unimpressed)}
<D>__{must have a way with stationery.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{gabriel, what are you doing!}
<A>__{gabriel raises the sawed off to rudy's chest. rudy flinches, but merlin's got him.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{gabriel!!!}
<A>__{gabriel fixes her with a stare. she shuts up. to rudy:}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'cause she's been good to you.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{gabriel, let him go }
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{read a lot about you, nick.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{what are you doing here?!}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{read you're a man of some knowledge.}

<D>__{gabriel!}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{a man of some travels.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{gabriel, i love him!}
<A>__{rudy's trying to speak, voice choked. gabriel nods to merlin, who again eases his hold. rudy coughs.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i'm... not... nick...}
<A>__{gabriel frowns. rudy turns to ashley.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i'm not him. i...}
<P>__{(then to gabriel)}
<D>__{you want something from nick, you got the wrong guy.}
<C>__{ashley}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{nick...}
<A>__{gabriel looks from her to him, then lowers his sawed off, and swings it into rudy's stomach. rudy buckles. panicked.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{who are you now.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{you got the wrong guy! she thinks i'm nick, i'm not!}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(to merlin)}
<D>__{put him in the truck.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i was in the joint with him! i knew about him and her, okay!? i took his place!}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you what...}
<C>__{rudy}

<P>__{(to ashley)}
<D>__{i i just wanted to be }
<A>__{a glance of regret amidst his desperation. ashley stares back, confused, searching his eyes.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you're not nick mason...}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i shared his cell!}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{but you were saying you were...}

<D>__{so you could get down her chimney.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{and you think telling me that's gonna help your cause.}
<A>__{gabriel ratchets him across the chin with the gun butt. rudy hits the floor. gabriel spins on ashley, enraged:}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{is this him!?}
<C>__{ashley}
<P>__{(reaches for rudy)}
<D>__{don't hurt him...}
<C>__{gabriel}

<A>__{gabriel doesn't shoot. studies rudy.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{well, he's gonna have to learn to give you some respect.}
<A>__{gabriel kicks rudy in the jaw. ashley screams. gabriel motions to his boys: jumpy and pug drag her outside. gabriel kicks rudy again. rudy lies there and takes it. merlin lights a cig, examines rudy and ashley's grocery bags:}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{hey. they got a shitload of cookies.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{take 'em.}
<C>__{merlin}
