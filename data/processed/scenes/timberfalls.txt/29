<L>__{exterior five corners day}
<A>__{mike and sheryl hike up a steep slope. as they step through the woods, they look upon... five large rocks, arranged in an awkward semi circle. they walk into the circle, take off their backpacks.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{this is incredible.}
<A>__{mike opens the tent pouch, starts removing the many parts.}

<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sher. seriously. let's wait `til morning.}
<A>__{obscured pov on sheryl as she stops. looks out towards the water. close on the concealed figure's eyes. two different colors, with his left being void of almost all color. also notice scarring around the left eye, there's no eyebrow and his skin is pale and splotchy. the concealed figure holds all his attention on... five corners sheryl realizes he's right and walks back over to mike.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{mike stares at the many assorted parts of the tent, the sheet of instructions laid out. he holds one of the poles, which consists of separate links connected by a string. he has no idea where to begin.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{do you know what you are doing?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i think its pretty obvious that i don't.}
