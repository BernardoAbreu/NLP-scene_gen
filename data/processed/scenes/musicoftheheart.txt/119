<D>__{don't they realize how much this program helps the kids?}
<C>__{mr. adams}
<D>__{simon's our third child to study with roberta. james is pre med, april's valedictorian now that says something!}
<C>__{mr. klein}
<D>__{i think we should inundate the board and the district with letters.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{you're wasting your time. the board and the district are not gonna pay for this program, no matter how many letters they get.}
<A>__{disappointed grumblings.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{what if we raise the money ourselves?}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{i can't see how they'd object to that.}
<A>__{a beat as people take this in.}
<C>__{concepcion}
<D>__{well once that newspaper article comes out, that should help bring in money.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{yeah, but what if it doesn't? for all we know, it's gonna be buried on the back page. besides, who says anyone's gonna give a damn about our kids?}
<C>__{dorothea}
<P>__{(to roberta)}
<D>__{what if you do a benefit concert? we can raise a batch of money from ticket sales, and then the concert itself could be great publicity. there's word of mouth... you could get reviewed...}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{it better be a good concert!}
<A>__{some people laugh but we see the anxiety on roberta's face.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{we have to offer something more than me and the kids.}
<P>__{(to dorothea)}
<D>__{do you think maybe your husband would perform with us?}
<C>__{dorothea}
<P>__{(slyly)}
<D>__{i'm sure i could persuade him with a little pillow talk. and maybe he can get another violinist too itzhak perlman, perhaps.}
<A>__{this gets people's attention.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{that would be fantastic.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{we could rent a place like the 92nd street y it's perfect for this. it seats about nine hundred people and if we charge between fifty and a hundred a ticket }
<C>__{isabel}
<P>__{(to roberta)}
<D>__{we could probably raise enough to reinstate your program for a year.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{sounds like a plan.}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(half to herself)}
<D>__{it better be a good concert.}
<A>__{the doorbell rings and roberta crosses to get it. dan enters, holding copies of the ny post, the daily news, and a couple of other papers. each paper has been opened to a specific page.}
