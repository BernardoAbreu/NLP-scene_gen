<L>__{exterior steep mountain face day}
<A>__{anna and kristoff hit what looks like a dead end. the face of the mountain goes straight up.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what now?}
<A>__{kristoff looks around, sighs. digs in his rucksack.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{...it's too steep. i've only got one rope, and you don't know how to climb mountains.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{says who?}
<A>__{sven nudges kristoff, who looks up to see anna trying to climb the cliff's flat face.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<P>__{(finding her ridiculous)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(straining)}
<D>__{...i'm going to see my sister.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{you're going to kill yourself.}
<A>__{kristoff watches her searching for footholds and hand holds.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{i wouldn't put my foot there.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{you're distracting me.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{or there. how do you know elsa even wants to see you?}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{i'm just blocking you out cause i gotta concentrate here.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{you know, most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{nobody wants to be alone. except maybe you }
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{i'm not alone.... i have friends, remember?}
<A>__{anna kicks a foot above her head to catch a foot hold.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you mean the love experts?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{yes, the love experts!}
<A>__{anna realizes she's stuck.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{...please tell me i'm almost there.}
<A>__{reveal: she's only about six feet up. her muscles shake.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{...does the air seem a bit thin to you up here?}
<A>__{kristoff smiles, getting a kick out of her.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{hang on.}
<A>__{he pulls the rope from his bag. just then olaf steps out from behind a rock and waves to kristoff.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{hey, sven? not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but i found a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ha ha. thank goodness. catch!}
<A>__{anna drops off the cliff. kristoff catches her.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{thanks! that was like a crazy trust exercise.}
<A>__{she hops down, brushes off her dress, and bounds off. kristoff watches after her, digging her fearless pluck.}
