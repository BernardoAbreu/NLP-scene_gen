<L>__{exterior bullochville train station georgia day}
<A>__{tom loyless, 39, stands waiting by a car dressed in a white suit. laconic, with a dry sense of humor, tom is a man of few words whose poker face hides a true desperation. he holds a telegram from franklin in his hand. as the train pulls in tom looks for franklin among the passengers making their exit. there are two different exits on the platform clearly marked white and colored. whites exit from the front of the train and blacks from the rear. lionel purdy, tiny, and dressed in a mailman's uniform, approaches tom. of indeterminate age and dubious intellect, his mail bag is almost as big as he is.}
