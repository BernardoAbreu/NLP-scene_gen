<L>__{interior elsa's bedroom day}
<A>__{elsa joins indy, waiting in the ransacked room. she looks around in shock.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{my room!}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{mine, too.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{what were they looking for?}
<A>__{she looks to indy, who pulls the grail diary from his pocket.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{this.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{the grail diary.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{you had it? you didn't trust me!}
<A>__{she looks hurt and beautiful. she comes closer to him.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i didn't know you.}
<A>__{she's awfully hard to resist.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{at least i let you tag along.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{oh, yes. give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{knock it off. you're not mad.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{no. you like the way i do things.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{it's lucky i don't do things the same way. you'd still be standing at the venice pier.}
<A>__{she stomps her foot angrily. indy flinches. she starts to walk away but indy grabs her.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{look, what do you think is going on here? since i've met you, i've nearly been incinerated, drowned, shot at, and chopped into fish bait. we're caught in the middle of something sinister here. my guess is dad found out more than he was looking for. and until i'm sure, i'm going to continue to do things the way i think they should be done.}
<A>__{he pulls her to him and kisses her.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{how dare you kiss me!}
<A>__{now elsa reaches for indy and kisses him.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{leave me alone. i don't like fast women.}
<A>__{but he embraces her, and elsa begins to nibble at his ear.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{and i hate arrogant men.}
<A>__{indy smiles slyly as they fall to the bed.}
