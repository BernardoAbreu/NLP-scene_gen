<A>__{the lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. anakin wriggles in. he pulls himself to his feet. there are candles everywhere. a shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut. by its light, anakin sees shmi, hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut. he cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. her eyes are closed. her face is bloodied. she has been terribly beaten. anakin cradles her tenderly.}

<A>__{shmi dies. anakin draws her to his breast. there is silence for a moment. anakin lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on the floor of the tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms.}
