<L>__{interior george & doris' house day}
<D>__{the very same newspaper is being read by an elegant woman sitting at a sumptuous breakfast table. we are in the large dining room of an ultra luxurious hollywood villa. all around her are magnificent furniture, superb paintings and objets d'art, including a beautiful trio of monkeys, one hiding its eyes, one with hands clasped to its ears and the third obscuring its mouth. george comes into the room and kisses his wife. she responds with cold indifference. you could cut the atmosphere with a knife. the woman hands george the newspaper. he knows what's up but tries to laugh it off. she doesn't find it funny, is as cold as stone and barely looks at him. she is obviously extremely annoyed with him. george picks up his dog and puts it on the table. jack drops his head to one side and his big eyes implore seem to implore her forgiveness. it's the exact expression of someone asking to be loved, but doris is implacable. she gets up, walks away and does not turn back. left on his own, george has a closed expression on his face. he seems unhappy to have hurt his wife's feelings. then he realizes that jack is on the table in a ridiculous pose, and signals to him to get down. the dog obeys. george looks at the paper, the cause of his problems.}
