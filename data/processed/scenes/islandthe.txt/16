<L>__{interior. airlock sector six}
<A>__{a sign reads "warning! contamination risk!". lincoln stands by as mccord u n l o o p s a neckchain w i t h a single forked pendant known as a "uni key". he slots it into the top of three keyholes. a light starts flashing and the airlock gives a heavily pressurized hiss.}
<L>__{interior. extractor shaft}
<A>__{a deep steady thrum. giant extractor fans churn above and below, both directions seemingly limitless. the bleak concrete shaft is streaked with soot, threaded by ladders and catwalks. on one such, we isolate lincoln and mccord. b o t h smoking cigarettes.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i t ' s too bad.}
<C>__{mccord}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{t h a t your shift's almost over.}
<C>__{mccord}
<D>__{you mean, these things? well, these things ain't good for you anyways.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{the y taste good.}
<A>__{an exchanged smile. a pause as they enjoy the guilty pleasure.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i like coming here. talking. most outsiders don't like to talk.}
<C>__{mccord}
<D>__{that's because we ain't supposed to. they got rules about fraternization.}
<A>__{lincoln nods. another pause as they drag on their cigarettes.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{what do you do when the shift's over?}
<C>__{mccord}
<D>__{m o r e of the same. they cycle us onto the disposal detail. hump `n dump crew.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{h u m p `n dump crew?}
<C>__{mccord}
<D>__{d e b r i s clearance. we hump the heavy stuff to a site on the outside.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{is it as bad as they say out there?}
<A>__{m c c o r d l o o k s momentarily puzzled. lincoln displays his gasmask.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{the air... the containments.}
<C>__{mccord}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{but not everywhere. not on the island.}
<C>__{mccord}
<P>__{( b e a t , stubs his cigarette)}
<D>__{i don't know too much about that.}
<A>__{lincoln eyes him narrowly. mccord p a u s e s , then tucks his lighter into the cigarette box and offers it with a palliative smile.}
<C>__{mccord}
<D>__{he y , take it from me, you got a sweet deal right here. so why worry, huh?}
<A>__{lincoln shrugs, accepting the gift with a slow exhale of smoke. we tilt up to follow the smoke plume, dissipating into the fans.}
