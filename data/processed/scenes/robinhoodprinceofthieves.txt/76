<L>__{interior cave day}
<A>__{robin's eyes he wakes. squints around him, the dark smoke filled recesses of the caves. the walls weave. eerie watery sounds, like the cries of drowning men. he tries to stand.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{robin!... robin!}
<A>__{a figure in a flowing white robe. angelic. floating towards him... marian. he tries to speak her name. reaches out his hand.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{death is not to be feared, robin. embrace it.}
<A>__{her laugh echoes around the cave, as if hundreds of lost souls are laughing with her. robin crawls away, cover ing his ears. marian lifts his face to hers.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{drink this.}
<A>__{weakly, robin tries to push away the cup. her hand grips his chin, forcing his mouth open.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{drink.}
<A>__{the liquid trickles over his lips. he tries to focus. her features are blurred, her voice hypnotic.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{look at me. listen to me. you belong to me. your soul is mine. you will obey my every word. do you understand?}
<A>__{her face is inches from his. he tries to pull away, his subconscious sounding alarms.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{why, marian?}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{because you love me. say it. you love me.}
<P>__{(as robin struggles)}
<D>__{say it!}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(sinking)}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{kiss me.}
<A>__{he gives himself to her. their lips meet... something changes in his vision. her eyes glow red. her face starts to shrivel he is kissing the wrinkled lips of mortianna. he pulls away... strong arms grab him. he shakes his head, trying to make sense. through his blurred vision, we see he is surrounded by masked men.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(slurred)}
<D>__{where is marian?}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{she is with friends.}
<P>__{(cackles)}
<D>__{your resistence is strong, but useless. sign this.}
<P>__{(as quill is forced into his hand)}
<D>__{you are a druid like your father. you consort with the devil. your confession will be witnessed by the bishop of hereford.}
<A>__{a guard forces robin's hand across the page... then cries out, clutching his back... an arrow lodged be tween his shoulders. in the cave mouth are wulf, bow in hand, bull kneeling beside sarah's corpse, and aslan.}
<C>__{mortianna}
<P>__{(horror)}
<D>__{the painted man!}
<A>__{aslan's war cry richochets off the cave walls. a curved scimitar in one hand, a straight english sword in the other, his arms are lethal windmills. the masked guards are cut down left and right. mortianna retreats, scurry ing into the depths of the cave. bull joins the fray, charging like his namesake, howling in rage, flailing at heads with his quarterstaff. wulf stays in the mouth, picking off men with deadly accuracy. a furious melee. bull and aslan mow down the enemy like hay, battling far superior odds. soon they are the only two left standing. bull peers cautiously into the dark ness. behind him, one of his victims crawls back to his feet... and lunges.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{behind you!}
<A>__{too late. a sword is driven through bull's gut. aslan grabs the attacker by the neck and pile drives him into the cave wall. the man's skull cracks against the rocks. aslan runs to robin's side, as wulf hurries to bull's. robin is slumped against a rock.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(groggy)}
<D>__{marian?}
<A>__{aslan runs to the back of the cave, searching. wulf is crouched beside bull, who murmurs his dying words.}
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{ya be sure sarah gits a christian burial. promise me, boy.}
<C>__{wulf}
<D>__{i promise.}
<A>__{aslan stumbles at the edge of a deep crevasse. far be low he sees mortianna, clambering down the steep rock. for a second their eyes meet. she hisses venom, hatred, fear then is gone.}
