<A>__{behind kathy and arthur, and elsewhere near rafkin and kalina three more doors slide open, unnoticed.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior basement glass corridor with rafkin and maggie}
<A>__{which is exactly what rafkin didn't want to hear... especially in the basement. maggie doesn't look too worried about things. taking things rather nonchalantly, while rafkin appears the frightened rabbit.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{look, you don't believe me, do you? see for yourself...}
<A>__{rafkin puts the ghost glasses on maggie, and pulls her in front of the first glass cube.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{i thought we've been over this. i can't see any ghosts.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{rafkin points into one of the cubes.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{maggie looks around intently, but comes back confused. rafkin looks at her, wondering. he pulls the glasses off her face and puts them on his own. he's shocked. the first two cubes are empty.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(panicking)}
<D>__{oh, no...}
<A>__{rafkin paces in front of the cubes. he peers worriedly into the next cube. at first he sees nothing, when suddenly, a hammer slams against the glass. rafkin whoops and jumps backwards. he grabs his heart.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{never fails... they always wait for you to put your face right up near the glass...}
<A>__{maggie eyes him warily. rafkin takes off the glasses and puts them on maggie. she looks into the cube. and screams.}
<B>__{through ghost glasses}
<A>__{a hugely built middle aged black man appears, dressed in layers of viciously torn leather, with a blacksmith apron covering what remains. in addition, nails and spikes are hammered into his body, from his head down to the sledge hammer that's been nailed to his handless arm.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{oh my god... it's a... it's a...}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{that's right, we're surrounded by 'em all the time. most of 'em can't hurt us. most of 'em don't want to hurt us... but there are exceptions.}
<A>__{the apparition glares at rafkin. he takes hold of a spike embedded deep in his shoulder and pulls. all eight inches of rusting metal comes out. he thrusts it at the glass, and pulls it across the surface in a shower of sparks, as if carving a hello from hell.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{what's he doing?}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{just saying hi. i helped put him here.}
<A>__{the ghost lowers his spike. into the glass he has etched the phrase "u myn." dennis takes a beat, then licks the glass.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(acting tough to ghost)}
<D>__{i love you too.}
<A>__{lightning quick, the apparition lifts his hammer and smashes it against the glass. sparks explode across the corridor. maggie jumps back into rafkin's arms.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{okay, i wanna go now...}
<A>__{maggie swallows hard. rafkin, half smiling, gestures down the corridor, and reluctantly, she follows. at the last moment, rafkin turns and flips the hammer the bird. but the ghost is gone...}
