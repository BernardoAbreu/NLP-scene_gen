<A>__{watson is alone, surveying the damage to his alfa, when he hears footsteps. he turns with a "what now?" expression and a shotgun butt is slammed into his forehead. he goes down. kipling stands over him, flanked by four human thugs. one of these is quint, senior human in harcourt's employ.}

<L>__{exterior zuma beach approach night}
<A>__{harcourt's private limo glides down the narrow access road, passing a lookout car attended by two alien thugs. the limo moves down to the beach, parking near an n.d. van. harcourt exits the limo, walks onto the sand to the back of the van. here he finds kipling and quint and the three human thugs. they have watson chained to the van's rear bumper, facing the sea, and have been working him over with a tire iron. he's bruised and bloody, but still conscious.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{any progress?}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{my arm's gettin' tired and so far, zip.}
<C>__{kipling}
<D>__{he is ss'verdlatya ss'alo to strader.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{what's that mean?}
<C>__{kipling}
<D>__{duty bonded. his allegiance to strader is above pain or life.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{you tellin' me this guy would die before he'd screw his boss and work for us? nobody's that dumb.}
<C>__{kipling}
<D>__{it is something you couldn't comprehend, quinterior}
<A>__{harcourt approaches watson, kneels beside him, careful to keep the knee of his designer pants out of the sand.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{i understand you have been resisting my offer mr. watson. your sense of duty to mr. strader is noble, but no longer an issue, i'm afraid...}
<A>__{harcourt signals and the two thugs drag an alien body from the back if the van: a middle aged alien, strader, shot twice through the front of his silk suit. watson's eyes widen in fear.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i will not make this offer again. i want you to work for me, to manage the nightclub as strader's successor. if you do, you will know a wealth and comfort our people never dared imagine...}
<A>__{watson stares at harcourt, scared but defiant.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{sss'k'a ta'!}
<A>__{harcourt studies watson a moment, perhaps even admiring his resolve. then }
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{it is such a pity to die for an outmoded value.}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{mr. quint, i believe it's time for our friend's swimming lesson.}
<A>__{watson freaks out, howling and lashing against the chains.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<P>__{(to watson)}
<D>__{it's important to learn new skills. essential to your growth as a person.}
<A>__{quint and the thugs free watson from the bumper. he bucks and lunges as they drag him toward the surf. quint addresses one of the thugs, a new guy.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{you never seen this before, have you, billy? oh, man, you ain't gonna believe it... seawater is like battery acid to these guys... i don't know what it is, some kinds chemical reaction. whatta you think it is, watson? whoa, hold him.}
<P>__{(a wave breaks}
<D>__{outside, the foam}
<P>__{rolls in)}
<D>__{what i love about the surf is you can never tell how far up it's going to come until it... whoops, got a little wet there.}
<A>__{the wave just sloshes over watson's lower legs. he screams. flailing, one of his hands dips below the surface of the water. he howls and yanks out his hand. we see the alien hand dripping seawater... then a thousand droplets of purple alien blood begin to bead all over the hand. the thugs get watson swinging.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{last call, sucker. one... two... three!}
<A>__{watson is flung into the surf.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{harcourt and kipling have walked down almost to the waterline. we hear watson's gurgles and screams... then nothing. kipling is very nervous this close to the water. harcourt seems unperturbed.}
<C>__{kipling}
<D>__{when we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops the two who came to question you about hubley.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<D>__{this is getting out of hand. i want you to deal with it. immediately.}
<A>__{a wave rushes up the sand. kipling quickly steps back. harcourt stands firm, staring it down, and the foam stops six inches from his dress shoes.}
<C>__{harcourt}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{we must learn to embrace the things we fear... and from that grow strong.}
<A>__{a moment, then he turns and starts back toward the limo. he motions to strader's body and the surf. the thugs grab the body and heave it into the waves.}
