<A>__{from the way atwood looks at her surroundings as she crosses the living room we get the feel that this woman misses nothing.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{... we think he's either dead or in jail on some other charge. this is probably a copycat.}
<A>__{detective snyder points her down the hall toward the bedroom and follows.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{that's why we called you. you're the god that tells us peons if we have a simple murder here or something we can dump on you.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{bite yourself.}
<A>__{atwood arrives in the doorway of the bedroom where the murders took place and stops. the bodies of the dance couple are now on the floor. the man is propped up against the bed in a sitting position. the woman has her head in the man's crotch. almost like mr. brooks, atwood's nostrils flare, but in atwood's case it's not the scent of death that arouses her but it's like she's searching for the scent of her prey. in a glance she memorizes the room, then steps inside.}
