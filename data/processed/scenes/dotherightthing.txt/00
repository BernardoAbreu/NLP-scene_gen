<A>__{wga #45816 "the greatest miracle christianity has achieved in america is that the black man in white christian hands has not grown violent. it is a miracle that 22 million black people have not risen up against their oppressors in which they would have been justified by all moral criteria, and even by the democratic tradition! it is a miracle that a nation of black people has so fervently continued to believe in a turn the other cheek and heaven for you after you die philosophy! it is a miracle that the american black people have remained a peaceful people, while catching all the centuries of hell that they have caught, here in white man's heaven! the miracle is that the white man's puppet negro 'leaders,' his preachers and the educated negroes laden with degrees, and others who have been allowed to wax fat off their black poor brothers, have been able to hold the black masses quiet until now."}
