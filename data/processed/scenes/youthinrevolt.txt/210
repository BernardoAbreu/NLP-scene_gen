<L>__{interior saunders' mobile home day}
<A>__{nick prances into the living room in his underwear. he starts to head into the kitchen when he catches sight of the full length mirror out of the corner of his eye. he stops in front of the mirror and flexes his biceps. admires himself. francois appears in the mirror behind nick, thompson slung over his shoulder.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{well, good morning, francois. what do you think?}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{what do i sink? i sink now's are chance to run for ze hills.}
<A>__{nick lowers his arms and furrows his brow.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{nick, we are young, yes? is the world not our oyster? beaucoup des filles. do you not want to know what it is like to make love to another girl?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i do, but... we've come so far. what about sheeni?}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{forget sheeni. yes, she will always be ze first conquest, but all zis time you saught zis was ze end, ze one and only, when in fact it is only ze beginning.}
<A>__{nick lifts his eyebrows with dawning epiphany. in the reflection we can see behind nick as albert leaps onto the love seat and barks at the sound of approaching sirens. nick runs to the window just in time to see half a dozen law enforcement vehicles pull up.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sheeni, the police are here!}
<A>__{he ducks down from the window as a chopper buzzes overhead.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{quick! maybe i can sneak out the back!}
<C>__{megaphone }
<D>__{nick twisp! we have you surrounded!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't understand. how do they even know i'm alive?}
<C>__{sheeni }
<D>__{well, i called them of course.}
<A>__{nick spins to face her. she's standing in the doorway and there's not a hint of wrong doing in her face.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{well, thanks a pantsful!}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{but, nickie, it had to be done.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{but... but why?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{i can't very well marry a wanted man, honey. look at it this way, in a few months you'll be a free man and we can be together in paris.}
<A>__{nick looks to francois in disbelief. but the frenchman just rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{you might as well break it to her now, nick.}
<A>__{a long pensive beat as nick contemplates telling her he may never see her again. but behind sheeni's air of control, nick finally sees the vulnerability he's had in his hands all along.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{francois is right of course, but on the other hand, why be cruel? after all, sheeni had managed to give me hope every step of the way. and if hope is what sheeni would now need to go on, well then...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{as always, you are right, my love.}
<A>__{sheeni beams. francois smacks his forehead with hand.}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{merd.}
<A>__{the frenchman in the mirror sticks the barrel of the thompson in his mouth and blows himself out of frame just as... ...the front door bursts open and the fbi agents surround nick.}
