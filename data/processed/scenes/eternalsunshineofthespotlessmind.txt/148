<A>__{joel and clementine review their separate lacuna packages together.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{says you were a bully...}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{a bully? moi?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{that's what it says. you drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{well, sounds like me. sorry, man.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{says you were jealous and suspicious.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{did i use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{doesn't sound like me.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{says you were constantly calling me a slob.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{it's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly familiar and bored. don't you think?}
<C>__{joel}
<P>__{(considering)}
<D>__{i sort of do. but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality. cleaned up enough to be erotic.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{we should have sex. it's old hat for us.}
<A>__{she smiles at nervous joel.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{you know my body like the back of your hand.}
<A>__{she unbuttons her blouse.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{every curve, every freckle.}
<A>__{she takes off her shirt. he stares at her. he has clearly never seen this body before.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{you're so beautiful.}
<A>__{she approaches him, kisses him, his arms wrap around her waist for the first time.}
