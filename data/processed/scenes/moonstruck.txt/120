<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{ronny is walking along the same stretch of sidewalk as loretta just was. he looks like hell, too. his hair is wild and he hasn't slept. he's thrown on an old leather jacket and brown leather gloves. he has a love bite on his neck, too. he starts to sing "o soave fanciulla". he sings it any old way, occasionally getting a good attack, occasionally just muttering his way through. sings as much of it as he remembers, which is a lot.}
<B>__{we watch ronny walking from the back now}
<A>__{he's singing away, carelessly sauntering along. he passes an italian couple of middle age. they smile as they recognize what he is singing. they start to sing along with him. they sing till they get to the ceiling of the aria, and to a resting place a little beyond. then they nod to each other appreciatively and go on their ways, ronny turning his back to the camera, and they walking into it.}
