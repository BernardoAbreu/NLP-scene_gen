<L>__{interior burch's dungeon morning}
<A>__{solomon again awakens. he hears sounds beyond the door...footsteps. eventually the door opens. enter james burch who runs the slave pen and ebenezer radburn who works as a turnkey and overseer. as the door opens, this is the first light to seep into the otherwise near black room. the shine is painful to solomon's eyes. with no salutation whatsoever, burch asks:}
<C>__{burch}
<D>__{well, my boy, how yah feel now?}
<A>__{solomon rises up as best he can. with all the resolve he can put together he states what he considers to be fact:}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{i am solomon northup. i am a free man; a resident of saratoga, new york. the residence also of my wife and children who are equally free. i have papers. you have no right whatsoever to detain me }
<C>__{burch}
<D>__{yah not any }
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{and i promise you i promise upon my liberation i will have satisfaction for this wrong.}
<C>__{burch}
<D>__{resolve this. produce your papers}
<A>__{with confidence solomon goes to the pocket of his trousers. he searches one, then the other, but they are empty. he feels quickly about himself, but clearly his papers have been lifted. solomon's confidence shifts, but to resolve rather than fear. papers or none, he will not be easily cowed. still, burch asserts:}
<P>__{burch (contâ€™d)}
<D>__{yah no free man. and yah ain't from saratoga. yah from georgia.}
<A>__{a moment. not a word spoken among the trio, but solomon and burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man yielding. burch says again:}
<C>__{burch }
<D>__{yah ain't a free man. yah nuthin' but a georgia runaway.}
<A>__{burch waits for solomon to acquiesce. solomon does not in any way. both men exchange a long and daring stare. the two are clearly at an intellectual stand off. burch, leans to radburn, says something which we cannot}
<B>__{distinguish.}
<A>__{radburn walks off camera and returns with a pair of "instruments:" a paddle the flattened portion, which is about the size in circumference of two open hands, and bored with a small auger in numerous places. he also carries a whip. a cat o nine tails; a large rope of many strands. the strands unraveled and a knot tied at the extremity of each. burch says again:}
<C>__{burch }
<D>__{yah a runaway nigger from georgia.}
<A>__{solomon stands with a quiet stoicism. he will say nothing of the kind. as that is the case, solomon is seized by both men. he is pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his back. radburn then steps on his chains, holding solomon down in a bent position. with no preamble, burch begins to beat solomon about the back with the paddle. burch strikes him wordlessly no taunting, no sneering. solomon screaming against each blow. his back immediately swelling with welts and}
<B>__{bruises.}
<A>__{this beating continues on and on and on until quite literally burch wears himself out with the effort. dripping in sweat and panting:}
<C>__{burch }
<D>__{yah still insist yah a free man?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{...i...i insist...}
<A>__{burch regrets hearing this. not from sympathy, but rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to beating solomon. yet, as if returning to work, burch returns to pummeling solomon. burch punctuates the blows with:}
<C>__{burch}
<D>__{yah a slave. yah a georgia slave!}
<A>__{burch continues to strike, and strike... this time until the paddle snaps in half. burch then grabs the whip. hardly missing a stroke, he whips solomon relentlessly, the flails cutting into solomon's back. again, burch's arm tires before solomon "breaks."}
<C>__{burch }
<D>__{are yah slave?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{... no ...}
<A>__{burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping... solomon's back is now torn open with lacerations and oozing with blood. finally burch can whip no more. he pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough energy to take up his instruments and exit. radburn lingers for a moment. he takes the irons off solomon's legs. opens the window some. as he makes these gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one wrought with poor sincerity:}
<C>__{radburn}
<D>__{i seen a good many of the black kind just where yah're. sick. make me sick. often times the situation was resolved, and i think; what was all the beatin' and abuse for? things end as they should, and the violence was for naught. so why cause trouble when they ain't no cause for it? be of a cooperative nature, and things don't need be particularly unpleasant.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{or, yah can carry on like yah been, and i fear yah won't live to see sunday nexterior}
<A>__{with that thought, radburn exits. solomon rests. but to rest seems like giving in to defeat. he begins pulling on his chains. but for all his struggling, the chain loosens none. solomon calls out:}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{help me! someone help me!}
<A>__{if anyone at all hears him, they do not respond. solomon continues his plaintive cry for assistance.}
