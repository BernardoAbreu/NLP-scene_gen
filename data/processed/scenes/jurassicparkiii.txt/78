<L>__{exterior jungle day}
<A>__{still following the faint ringing, grant and eric turn to find}
<B>__{a sail}
<A>__{moving through the low trees. we recognize it as the back of a spinosaurus. we might think it's any random spinosaurus, except for the ringing coming from somewhere inside it. grant and eric press back against a tree, keep perfectly still as they hear the thoooomb, thoooomb, thooomb of the creature's footsteps reverberating. it's tail rustkes against the brush. it's moving behind them, and it's close. we hear the ringing move from left to right as it passes. so far, its has no idea they're there. looking across the clearing, eric is startled to see}
<B>__{paul and amanda}
<A>__{are no more than 20 yards away, also hiding. an involuntary reflex, eric calls out...}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{mon! dad!}
<A>__{grant immediately covers the boys mouth. but it's to late. the dinosaur has stopped. we still can't see it. we don't know how close it is. paul and amanda spot eric with grant. they're a thousand emotions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed. they want to run to him, to yell out to him, but the monster is close. grant takes his hand off eric's mouth. they both stay completely silent. all this time, the sat phone is ringing. than it stops. and after an agonizing beat, the beast moves. at first we're not sure which direction it's headed, but finally we can tell its moving away. once the sail is finally out of sight, eric breaks from grant's hold and dashes to his parents' arms. they coop him up. hug him, kiss him, their affection unquenchable. he's crying.}
<C>__{amanda}
<P>__{(reassuring him)}
<D>__{sweetheart, you're okay.}
<P>__{(reassuring herself)}
<D>__{you're okay.}
<P>__{(disbelieving)}
<D>__{you're okay.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{never had a doubt. never did. us kirby men, we stick around, huh?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{we do.}
<A>__{looking at her grubby son, amanda licks her shirttail, trying to rub his face clean.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{honey, there's not enough spit in the world for that.}
<A>__{she laughs. it's the first times she's laughed in two months. billy crosses the distance to grant.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{we need to keep moving.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{alan, i want to tell you that i'm so sorry about the...}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{billy, i can't talk to you now.}
<A>__{he walks off. billy follows him.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{please, okay? just yell at me. call me an idiot. an asshole. stupid. tell me i screwed up because i know i did.}
<A>__{grant doesn't respond.}
<C>__{billy }
<D>__{i thought if we could get a raptor back to the mainland, we could get serious money for it. enough to fund the digging for 10 years. more. whatever it took.}
<A>__{grant shakes his head, disgusted, but doesn't stop.}
<C>__{billy }
<D>__{you have to believe me. i did it with the best intentions.}
<C>__{grant}
<P>__{(finally turning on him)}
<D>__{some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. you rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{you're no better than the people who built this place.}
<A>__{grant keeps walking, leaving billy with his guilt.}
