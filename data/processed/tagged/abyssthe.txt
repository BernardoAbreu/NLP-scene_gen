<D>__{tell me later.}
<A>__{he grabs her head in both hands and pulls her mouth to his. they lock together in a fierce kiss, fueled by passion and terror... the naked realization of love hanging over the abyss of death. she breaks away at the last possible second and quickly pulls his helmet over his head. seats is down over the neck ring. lock the bail out handle, sealing it. even with her head press up into the highest point of the ceiling, lindsey's mouth is barely above water. she give a scared little laugh.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{this is maybe not such a great plan, is it?}

<C>__{one night}
<D>__{hey. hey! hey!! look... it's bud.}
<C>__{monk}
<D>__{that's impossible.}
<A>__{lindsey bolts to the screen. stares at the message printing out. a huge grin wraps around her face.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{no it's not.}
<C>__{mcbride }
<D>__{what's it say?}
<A>__{lindsey take the mike and sits before the screen. during the message, her voice will go through an emotional spectrum from confusion to wonder, to a childlike joy.}

<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{it says... "virgil brigman back on the air have some new friends down here i guess theyve been here awhile they've left us alone but it bothers them to see us hurting each other getting out of hand lately"}
<A>__{lindsey grins as she reads the next part...}
<C>__{linsey}
<D>__{"they sent a message hope you got it"}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{i'd say that's a big 10 4, jack.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{"they want us to grow up a bit and put away childish things of course its just a suggestion."}
<L>__{interior benthic explorer bridge day}
<A>__{beyond the windows the ocean is calm. the sky steel gray put placid. mcbride turns to commodore demarco and the navy contingent, his eyebrows cocked.}
<C>__{mcbride}
<D>__{looks like you boys might by out of business.}
<C>__{bendix}
<D>__{something's going on down there. i'm getting some big readings....}
<A>__{bendix is hunched over the sonar, and we can see the screens lit up like a wurlitzer.}
<L>__{interior deepcore}
<A>__{in deepcore the crew becomes aware of a strange subsonic rumbling. the sonar is going crazy. one night puts the headphones of her passive sonar rig up to her ear, then jerks it away.}
<C>__{one night}
<D>__{whew! whatever this is, it's major.}
<A>__{the rumbling increases and a glow diffuses the water. the glow intensifies until a blinding shaft of light blasts through the viewport, bathing the whole interior in a cold white radiance. a last message appears on the screen: keep you pantyhose on youre gonna love this the radiance intensifies. everyone covers their eyes. it flares to white out.}

<L>__{interior exterior explorer bridge day}
<A>__{bendix and the bridge crew are going nuts. all their instruments are pegged.}
<C>__{bendix}
<D>__{active is pinging back something big... it's enormous! coming up right under us.}
<C>__{demarco}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{bendix}
<D>__{where? everywhere!!}
<P>__{(looks out the window)}
<D>__{over there! port bow.}
<L>__{exterior benthic explorer and ocean}
<A>__{a depression appears in the surface of the sea a hundred yards off, not swirling down like a whirlpool, just dimpling down. it gets wider. deeper. rapidly becomes a yawning pit. the ocean is opening. now the surface is churned by turbulence. slow massive roils of tremendous power boil up from the depths. mcbride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better. the open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across. the ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom. something rises in the center of the opening. a massive spire. smoothly curving and iridescent. off the starboard beam, a quarter mile away, another spire rises. tons of seawater fall from its sides with a thunderous roar, the energy of niagara. off the port bow... another spire. and another, beyond the destroyer albany, dwarfing it. six towers... plus one larger, in the center. rising. one the explorer's deck, a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out the sun. the air, the sea, the deck... all vibrate with the thunder of}
<B>__{creation.}
<A>__{and now for the payoff shot: we're high, looking down. the spires form a perfect ring a mile across. a vast dark form, like a great shadow, rises from}
<B>__{the depths beneath the ships. the spires are connected. it is all one. the nti ark.}
<A>__{it surfaces with slow majesty, gently beaching all the ships on its broad back. we recognize it as the structure into which bud was led by the angelic being, which we assumed was a city. the explorer rocks gently on its flat hull, clunking massively to one side as it settles. the bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of the vast, slightly curved hull. the missile cruiser rocks back and forth nearby, high and dry... its prop whining futility. on explorer's deck, mcbride, bendix, demarco, the rest of the navy contingent... they're all standing there open mouthed, in a dream like daze. touched by the hand of god.}
<C>__{bendix}
<D>__{look...}
<A>__{what they see fifty yards away, between them and the albany, sits deepcore two. it looks like a particularly ugly and unwanted toy, sitting on the glistening plain of the nti ark's hull. closer, on trimodule c, as the hatch at the bottom opens. catfish's feet appear, bicycling. he swings down to the pearlescent 'deck'. stands there blinking in the sunlight, mole like. jammer plonks down behind him. he turns, lifts lindsey down. hippy, sonny, and the rest, emerge into the light of the sun. a deliverance from the blackest night they will ever know.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{we should be dead. we didn't decompress.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook up coke.}
<C>__{hippy}
<D>__{they must've done something to us.}
<A>__{lindsey has tears streaming down her cheeks... for the sun, for life, for their deliverance and the larger one she knows has happened, an epiphany for the whole human race.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{oh, yes. i think you could say that.}
<A>__{she blinks. seeing something not far away. she gives a little laugh, or something between laughing and crying. reverse, as bud walks up the curving incline of one of the mouth like enterances to the nti structure. his suit is casually unzipped and the fbs helmet dangles from one hand jauntily. she starts toward him. breaks into a run. then stops a few feet from him. watching him come to her. his smile, his eyes illuminating her. he stops and she touches him, lightly. is this real? the look at each other, wonderingly a moment. then laugh. she sniffs loudly.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{hello, brigman.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{hello, mrs. brigman.}
