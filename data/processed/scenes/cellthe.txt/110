<A>__{novak drops to the floor below. instantly affected by the similarities and the differences to the idealized cell of stargher's mind, he feels another wave of dizziness, but pushes on. and is hit hard by the sight of drowned julia, her motionless body floating past him. her eyes open and bubbles drift from her nose and mouth. novak bangs on the plexiglas and calls to her.}

<D>__{julia!}
<A>__{the thick plexiglass still remains, but she now can see him. novak pulls his id badge and smacks it against the glass.}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{move aside!}
<A>__{he pulls his gun and takes aim. julia swims to the top of the cell and presses herself against the ceiling. bang bang bang bang bang bang. novak fires a circle of shots into the thick plastic. water slowly leaks, but the damn thing is still solid. he lifts the industrial vcr and rams it at the bullet damaged section. crack! crash! water pours from the cell. julia's body descends on the torrent of water. novak reaches inside and pulls her to safety. he's just about to give her cpr when she coughs, sputters, and thirstily drinks in oxygen. holding her tightly, novak sinks to the floor, the water from the cell spilling everywhere.}
