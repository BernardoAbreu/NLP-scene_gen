<A>__{kumar reaches for the weed, but the hippie asshole knocks his hand away...}
<C>__{hippie asshole}

<A>__{hippie asshole sizes kumar up and then gives kumar him a measly dime bag...}
<C>__{hippie asshole}

<C>__{hippie asshole}
<D>__{one who understands the concept of supply and demand, dude.}
<A>__{kumar and the hippie asshole stare each other down. after a couple seconds, kumar shakes his head, pissed off. he takes out his wallet and hands all his cash to the hippie asshole.}
<C>__{hippie asshole}
