<L>__{128 ramel's house. impasse st. vincent de paul.}
<A>__{outside inside. day. august 26. impasse st. vincent de paul, noon. there are helicopters in the sky, and paras fill the alley. their faces are pale and tense, their eyes wide open, their hands clutch their machine guns. there is a strange silence. then a movement at the back of the alley, a voice, a brief greeting. mathieu has arrived and he is saying to an officer:}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{now is not the time for heroes. give me the megaphone.}
<A>__{mathieu takes the megaphone in his hands and approaches an open door. through the doorway the inner courtyard of the house is visible where the corpses of four paras are strewn about. ramel and si mourad are on the first floor balcony, lying in wait behind the railings, so they are able to watch the door, courtyard, and the stairway that leads from the balcony to the terrace. on the terrace there are other paras who are facing the balcony. from time to time they release a burst of machine gun fire. the voice of mathieu is heard over the loudspeaker.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{ramel ... si mourad ... use your heads. if you go on like this, i wouldn't want to be in your place when you are captured ... because you will be captured in the end, and you know it too. surrender! if you do it immediately, i promise that you will not be harmed and you will have a fair trial. can you hear me?}
<A>__{ramel and si mourad look at each other.}
<C>__{mourad}
<D>__{who is speaking?}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{mathieu. colonel mathieu.}
<C>__{mourad}
<D>__{we don't trust you, colonel. come forward, show yourself.}
<A>__{a moment of silence.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{i don't trust you either. first stand up so i can see you, and keep your hands still and well in sight.}
<A>__{mourad hesitates an instant, glances at ramel, then:}
<C>__{mourad}
<D>__{okay. but we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. give us a written statement, mathieu, and then we'll surrender.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{how can i give you this statement?}
<C>__{mourad}
<D>__{we'll lower a basket from the window ...}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{okay, i will make the statement in writing ...}
<A>__{mourad shows his companion the two large time bombs that are on the floor in front of him. he takes one, begins to prepare it, and regulates the mechanism. at the same time, he tells ramel in arabic to go find the basket. ramel crawls past the doors which are all closed, and asks for a basket. a door opens and an old woman appears. she hands him a basket with its cord rolled up.}
<C>__{mourad}
<P>__{(without turning around)}
<D>__{a newspaper too, or a piece of paper ...}
<A>__{ramel brings him the basket and newspaper. mourad has loaded the time bomb mechanism, and the tic toc sound is sharp and clear. now he has to move the second hand. mourad's hands do not tremble, his glance is attentive, concentrating. ramel watches him without saying a word; his fear is obvious. without moving, his eyes glued to the bomb dial:}
<C>__{mourad}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{are you ready, colonel?}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{yes ... but let me first see you.}
<A>__{mourad moves one of the clock hands to precede the other one by a minute. immediately afterward he places the flat and rectangular bomb in the bottom of the basket. the basket seems to be empty. the piece of newspaper protects its bottom. mourad tells ramel to get up, and he too gets up. their machine guns are lying on the ground. meanwhile, mourad has begun to count to himself silently, his lips moving: one, two, three, four ... from the terrace, the paras can see ramel and mourad standing up not very far away, their empty hands resting near the basket on the railing. a para shouts:}
<C>__{para}
<D>__{we see them. you can come.}
<A>__{mourad begins to lower the basket very slowly.}
<C>__{mourad}
<P>__{(counting)}
<D>__{60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53 ...}
<A>__{mathieu enters the courtyard together with an officer and other paras. he looks up toward the balcony, smiles, and shows them a folded piece of paper.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{here it is ... you know that when i give my word, i keep it ...}
<A>__{mourad does not answer, but looks at mathieu as if to calculate the distance and time, and slows down even more the basket's descent. mathieu moves forward a few steps, as if to go for the basket that is hanging on the other side of the courtyard, but suddenly he seems perplexed for a second, and then changes his mind. he turns to the nearest para, and gives him the note.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{you go ...}
<A>__{mourad's face has remained motionless. in his expression there is a shade of disappointment. he sees mathieu retrace his steps toward the door, and is now surrounded by a group of paratroopers ...}
<C>__{mourad}
<P>__{(counting)}
<D>__{25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19 ...}
<A>__{the basket has stopped moving two yards from the ground. in order to reach it, the para has to step over the corpses of his dead companions, his face hardens, he reaches the basket, and extending his arm, he throws in the note. the basket does not move; the para looks up.}
<C>__{para}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{hurry up, black bastard!}
<A>__{mourad smiles at him, and mumbles something in arabic, a phrase that he doesn't manage to finish, for now is heard the explosion.}
