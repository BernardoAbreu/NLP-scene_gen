<L>__{interior pool hall day}
<A>__{eddie opens the door and emerges from the back room. a dozen comacho goons have gathered. behind them are another two dozen hostile spectators. but no sign of the backup. he pulls out his gun. the remaining innocent bystanders split for the exit. eddie walks forward into the room. the comachos and their soldiers stand around him. several have guns. eddie keeps them under the point of his gun. he gets to the door and has to turn his back on it to keep the gang in his sights. a gun is pressed into eddie's back. he drops his gun. luis kicks eddie across the room. eddie lands at the feet of the gang.}
<C>__{luis}
<D>__{take him apart.}
<A>__{eddie springs to his feet, and in the same motion decks his nearest attacker. the battle is on. hardwood pool cues crack around him. the first four or five never get a chance to lay a finger on him. battered and broken, they litter the billiard tables and floor. but eddie is outnumbered 20 to 1.}
