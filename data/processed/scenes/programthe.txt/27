<L>__{interior keller center day}
<A>__{the football meeting room. a quarter amphitheatre. the freshman, including darnell, down in front. nervous, talking very little, eyes playing over the pictures of former e.s.u. greats arranged on the wall of honor. behind them, the upperclassmen, bantering, conversation punctuated with laughter. a door opens. the assistant coaches file in. the room hushes immediately. coach winters walks in. the upperclassmen break into applause; the freshmen quickly take their cue and join in.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{good to see you again, gentlemen.}
<P>__{(catching sight of darnell)}
<D>__{jefferson, either take off the earring or put on a dress.}
<A>__{the upperclassmen hoot, as darnell, embarrassed, takes off his earring.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{i wanna talk a little about what we're trying to do here. there are many highly respected people who feel football is about preparation for life.}
<A>__{the players nod reverentially at this established axiom of the football cannon.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{these people are full of shit. you see, football is not like life.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it's better. more exciting, more intense, more fun. in life, people are always wondering how they measure up; whether they're getting ahead or fallin' behind. in football, you know. every week you get a chance to show what you're made of, a chance to demonstrate the physical and personal qualities that all those poor bastards who can't play this game are left to agonize about.}
<A>__{spreading smiles all around. it's good to be a football player.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{last year we didn't make enough of those chances. last year everyone felt we let the school down. fuck the school. we let ourselves down.}
<P>__{(pointing to the wall of honor)}
<D>__{we let down a great tradition, a 120 year old line of champions.}
<A>__{the smiles are gone. lots of set faces now. shame. anger, retribution.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{any football program worth the name is a special brotherhood, an elite corps of warriors, a select group of knights. that first time our starting unit takes the field, the first time we huddle up; that's our inner circle, that's our round table. if i were an upperclassman, i'd be real nervous about my seat, cause we got some very talented new comers this year. guys who want a place at the table.}

<P>__{the podium)}
<D>__{this is the trophy one of our freshman, darnell jefferson, won as a pennsylvania state high school first team all american. you know what this says to me?}
<A>__{the freshmen are hanging on every word.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{not a god damn thing.}
<A>__{he smashes the trophy on the podium, breaking it in half, shattering the base. darnell and the other freshmen are agog. the upperclassmen stifle laughs, particularly ray griffen.}
<C>__{winters}
<P>__{(to the freshmen)}
<D>__{everybody here was a high school all american.}
<P>__{(to all the players)}
<D>__{whatever any of you have done before is out the window. we're startin' over. ground zero. the table is empty. are you ready?}
<A>__{the upperclassmen nod, steely, purposeful. we go to the freshmen. they're not so sure.}
