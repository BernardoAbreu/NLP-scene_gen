<L>__{interior control room. dusk.}
<A>__{christof, a trace of panic in his eyes, turning to chloe.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{did he see it?}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{the reason for christof's concern becomes all too apparent as the helicopter passes over the power plant, where the struggling truman is being escorted away. we see an aerial shot from the helicopter as it emerges directly above the sydney skyline.}
<L>__{interior truman's house kitchen. night.}
<A>__{meryl and truman sit at their kitchen table. truman stoic, tears rolling down meryl's cheeks. truman's airline ticket torn to shreds on the table in front of them.}
<C>__{meryl}
<D>__{let me get you some help, truman. you're not well.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(ignoring her tears and medical advice)}
<D>__{why do you want to have a child with me? you can't stand me.}
<C>__{meryl}
<D>__{that's not true.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(suddenly angry)}
<D>__{don't lie to me!}
<A>__{truman's raised voice backs meryl to her feet. truman follows, getting in her face.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{tell me what's happening?!}
<C>__{meryl}
<P>__{(frightened but remaining poised)}
<D>__{i thought you knew everything. what could i tell you?}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(backing her up against the kitchen bench)}
<D>__{you're part of this, aren't you?!}
<A>__{meryl grabs a kitchen knife from a wooden block to protect herself.}
<C>__{meryl}
<D>__{truman, you're scaring me!}
<A>__{truman looks in her eyes and, with surprising swiftness, grabs her wrist and disarms her.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{no, you're scaring me, meryl!}
<A>__{truman grabs meryl by the hair and turns the knife on her. while pressing the blade to meryl's throat, truman starts to march her around the room, talking to the walls, light fixtures, a mirror, doorknob, framed picture, blank television.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{stop this now or i kill your leading lady.}
<P>__{(to a lamp)}
<D>__{i know you can hear me.}
