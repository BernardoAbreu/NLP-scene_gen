<L>__{interior coffee shop morning}
<A>__{jules and vincent sit at a booth. in front of vincent is a big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a muffin. he seems far away in thought. the waitress pours a refill for both men,}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{thanks a bunch.}
<P>__{(to jules, who's nursing his coffee)}
<D>__{want a sausage?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{naw, i don't eat pork.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{are you jewish?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i ain't jewish man, i just don't dig on swine.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{they're filthy animals. i don't eat filthy animals.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{sausages taste good. pork chops taste good.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{a sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie. i will never know 'cause even if it did, i wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. pigs sleep and root in shit. that's a filthy animal. i don't wanna eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{how about dogs? dogs eat their own feces.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i don't eat dog either.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. but a dog's got personality. and personality goes a long way.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{so by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he's cease to be a filthy animal?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{we'd have to be talkin' 'bout one motherfuckin' charmin' pig. it'd have to be the cary grant of pigs.}
<A>__{the two men laugh.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{good for you. lighten up a little. you been sittin' there all quiet.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i just been sittin' here thinkin'.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(mouthful of food)}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{the miracle we witnessed.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{the miracle you witnessed. i witnessed a freak occurrence.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{do you know that a miracle is?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{an act of god.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{what's an act of god?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i guess it's when god makes the impossible possible. and i'm sorry jules, but i don't think what happened this morning qualifies.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{don't you see, vince, that shit don't matter. you're judging this thing the wrong way. it's not about what. it could be god stopped the bullets, he changed coke into pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys. you don't judge shit like this based on merit. whether or not what we experienced was an according to hoyle miracle is insignificant. what is significant is i felt god's touch, god got involved.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{but why?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{that's what's fuckin' wit' me! i don't know why. but i can't go back to sleep.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{so you're serious, you're really gonna quit?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{the life, most definitely.}
<A>__{vincent takes a bite of food. jules takes a sip of coffee in the b.g., we see a patron call the waitress.}
<C>__{patron}
<D>__{garcon! coffee!}
<A>__{we recognize the patron to be pumpkin from the first scene of pumpkin and honey bunny.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{so if you're quitting the life, what'll you do?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{that's what i've been sitting here contemplating. first, i'm gonna deliver this case to marsellus. then, basically, i'm gonna walk the earth.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what do you mean, walk the earth?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{you know, like caine in "kung fu." just walk from town to town, meet people, get in adventures.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{how long do you intend to walk the earth?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{until god puts me where he want me to be.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what if he never does?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{if it takes forever, i will wait forever.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{so you decided to be a bum?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i will just be jules, vincent no more, no less.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{no jules, you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change. they walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what i throw away, and dogs piss on 'em. they got a word for 'em, they're called bums. and without a job, residence, or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be a fuckin' bum!}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{look my friend, this is just where me and you differ}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what happened was peculiar no doubt about it but it wasn't water into wine.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{all shapes and sizes, vince.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{stop fuckin' talkin' like that!}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{if you find my answers frightening, vincent, you should cease askin' scary questions.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i gotta take a shit. to be continued.}
<A>__{vincent exits for the restroom. jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... pumpkin and honey bunny rise with guns raised.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{everybody be cool, this is a robbery!}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{any of you fuckin' pricks move and i will execute every one of you motherfuckers! got that?!}
<A>__{jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. under the table, jules' hand goes to his .45 automatic. he pulls it out, cocking it.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{customers stay seated, waitresses on the floor.}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{now mean fuckin' now! do it or die, do it or fucking die!}
<A>__{like lightning, pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. while honey bunny screams out threats to the patrons, keeping them terrified.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{you mexicans in the kitchen, get out here! asta luego!}
<A>__{three cooks and two busboys come out of the kitchen.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{on the floor or i will cook you ass, comprende?}
<A>__{they comprende. the portly manager speaks up.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i'm the manager here, there's no problem, no problem at all}
<A>__{pumpkin heads his way.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{you're gonna give me a problem?}
<A>__{he reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the manager's neck.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{what? you said you're gonna give me a problem?}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{no, i'm not. i'm not gonna give you any problem!}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{i don't know, honey bunny. he looks like the hero type to me!}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{don't take any chances. execute him!}
<A>__{the patrons scream. jules watches all this silently, his hand tightly gripping the .45 automatic under the table.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{please don't! i'm not a hero. i'm just a coffee shop manager. take anything you want.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{tell everyone to cooperate and it'll be all over.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{everybody just be calm and cooperate with them and this will be all over soon!}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{well done, now git your fuckin' ass on the ground.}
