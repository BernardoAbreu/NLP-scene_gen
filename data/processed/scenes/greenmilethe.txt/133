<L>__{interior house night}
<A>__{...and comes up the hallway toward the stairs.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{don't you go up there! don't you do it!}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{boss, you just be quiet now and let me be.}
<A>__{coffey mounts the stairs with the others at his heels, heading up toward that quavering voice:}
<C>__{melinda }
<D>__{stay out of here! whoever you are, just stay out! i'm not dressed for visitors, you rat's asshole!}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{coffey enters, trailed by the others. paul pauses, horrified. the woman propped in bed barely resembles melinda moores anymore she looks made up like a halloween witch, her livid skin hanging in a loose trail of wrinkles, one corner of her mouth twisted. yellowish bile stains her chin and the front of her nightgown. her hair has gone white and straw like, her eyes glowering at coffey with lively, irrational interest:}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{oh, so big! pull down your pants! let's have a look!}
<A>__{hal groans with despair. coffey just stands there for a moment, watching her from a distance, then approaches the bed...}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{don't come near me, pigfucker.}
<A>__{...but as he draws closer, a change occurs. her features soften, her eyes become more sane and aware.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{why do you have so many scars? who hurt you so badly?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{don't hardly remember, ma'am.}
<A>__{coffey sits on the edge of the bed. the lights seem to flare hotter and brighter. tears are forming in melinda's eyes.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{john coffey, ma'am. like the drink, only not spelt the same.}
<A>__{she lays back, staring at him with shining fascination. the world seems to be slowing down, growing very still indeed... ...and he starts bending slowly toward her.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{ma'am?}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{yes, john coffey?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{i see it. i see it.}
<A>__{he comes closer...closer still...}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{you be still now. you be so quiet and so still.}
<A>__{he brushes her forehead with his lips...the gentlest whisper of a kiss...then moves his mouth down to hers. for a moment we can see one of her eyes staring past him, filling with an expression of surprise... ...and then her face is lost to view as coffey puts his lips on hers. we hear a soft whistling sound as he begins inhaling the air deeply from her lungs. something hot and glowing starts passing between them, drawn on his breath... the men watch. the house seems to shudder in that moment, as if the entire world has shifted an inch to the right...}
<B>__{downstairs parlor}
<A>__{...and the grandfather clock stops ticking, the pendulum stopping dead, the glass face cracking neatly up the center...}
<B>__{bedroom}
<A>__{...and a windowpane cracks. then another. a picture falls off the wall. a lightbulb bursts, showering glass. paul smells smoke, realizes the fringed coverlet of the bed has caught fire. moving like a man in a dream, he reaches for the waterglass on the nightstand, douses the flames. coffey keeps kissing melinda in that deep and mysterious way, inhaling and inhaling, her hand held in his like a tiny white bird. for a moment we actually hear something screaming, as if some willful imp were being extracted by force... ...and then it's over. coffey raises his head, revealing: melinda's beautiful face. her mouth no longer droops. color is coming back to her hair. her skin is shining with life. coffey regards her raptly for a moment or two, then starts coughing violently. he turns away and drops to his knees, hacking like a man in the last stages of tuberculosis. paul and his men are expecting coffey to spit out the "bugs", but he doesn't he just keeps coughing, deep and hard, barely finding time to snatch in the next breath of air. hal goes to his wife, beyond stunned, sits at her side. she looks back at him with amazement, her face like a dirty mirror that's been suddenly wiped clean. john's coughing grows even worse. brutal drops to his side and slaps his broad, spasming back.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{john! sick it up! cough 'em out like you done before!}
<A>__{coffey just keeps retching, eyes watering from the strain, spit flying from his mouth.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{he's choking! whatever he sucked out of her, he's choking on it!}
<A>__{paul starts toward them. coffey crawls away, pressing himself into a corner with his face against the wallpaper. he's still making gruesome deep hacking sounds, but getting it under control. he weakly waves paul off let me be. paul looks to the bed. hal sits with melinda, stroking her brow. color is blooming in her cheeks even as we watch.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{how did i get here? we were going to the hospital in indianola, weren't we? we stopped and you bought me a packet of posies...}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{shhh. it doesn't matter. it doesn't matter anymore.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{did i have the x ray? did i}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{they both look at him.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it was clear. there was no tumor.}
<A>__{hal bursts into tears. melinda sits up, comforting him. her eyes are drawn to the corner.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{who is that man?}
<A>__{coffey is struggling to rise. brutal does his best to help.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{john? can you turn around? can you turn around and see this lady?}
<A>__{coffey turns. his face is ashen gray, seriously ill.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{john coffey, ma'am.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{like the drink, only not spelled the same.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{no, ma'am. not spelt the same at all.}
<A>__{she pushes the covers aside to rise. hal tries to stop her...}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{melly, no...}
<A>__{...but she pushes his hand gently aside. hal watches in wonder as she stands, takes a first tentative step...and walks to coffey. she gazes up and touches his face.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{i dreamed of you. i dreamed you were wandering in the dark, and so was i. we found each other. we found each other in the dark.}
<A>__{she undoes her necklace, holds it up for him. he hesitates, glances to paul. paul nods it's all right. coffey lowers his head. melinda affixes the delicate chain around his neck.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{it's st. christopher. i want you to have it, mr. coffey, and wear it. he'll keep you safe. please wear it for me.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{thank you, ma'am.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{thank you, john.}
<A>__{her arms go around his neck, hugging him tightly as if she might never let go.}
