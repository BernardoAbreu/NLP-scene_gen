<L>__{interior dining room}
<A>__{bobby enters. sitting at the large table is marat, playing with one of his grandchildren. bobby knocks on the doorframe to announce his entrance. when buzhayev spots him, the child hides behind marat's leg. marat lets out a laugh at this; to the child:}
<C>__{marat buzhayev}
<D>__{no no it's okay. say hello...}
<A>__{the boy waves perfunctorily.}
<C>__{marat buzhayev }
<D>__{now we go this week to the field, okay? to ride the horses? go to mama.}
<A>__{marat addresses the boy clutching his leg (ad lib a russian "go"), kisses him, and the child runs off. bobby steps closer to marat:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{mr. buzhayev... i'm real sorry about what happened the other night.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{[if] i was working, maybe i would've been able to do something, but... anyway, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{marat buzhayev}
<D>__{it's not your fault...}
<A>__{marat darkens considerably. more interior tone, almost as much for himself as for bobby:}
<C>__{marat buzhayev }
<D>__{you can't always control everyone in your family...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{my nephew, he don't come back to the club anymore.}
<A>__{marat brings his hand to his head, looks pained.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{you don't mind my saying, i think that's probably the right thing to do.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{things get back to normal, i'm hoping we could get started on what we talked about.}
<C>__{marat buzhayev}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{we need time for the bad publicity to go away.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{mr. buzhayev, my getting arrested ain't gonna be a problem. i don't got a record }
<A>__{with great effort, marat stands.}
<C>__{marat buzhayev}
<D>__{i know. i don't worry about any of that.}
<A>__{he puts his arm around bobby's shoulder.}
<C>__{marat buzhayev }
<D>__{i used to teach chemistry before i come over here, and now i have the fur store, and this. one thing i learned here, you can always start over. so don't worry someday, we do it. okay? someday.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{yeah... all right...}
<P>__{kalina buzhayev (o.c.; subtitle)}
<D>__{food is ready!}
<A>__{marat looks at bobby with great sympathy as they walk toward the living room.}
<C>__{marat buzhayev}
<D>__{you take some time off, everything will be fixed in a little bit. then you come back. i pay you for the time. come on...}
<A>__{bobby mutters a "thank you." buzhayev touches his cheek. marat then turns back into the dining room, spreading his arms affectionately and wide, yelling "ohhh" to the children as they cheer. angle on bobby as we go to:}
