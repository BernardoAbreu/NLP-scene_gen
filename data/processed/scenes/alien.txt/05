<D>__{where are we?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{sandy, contact traffic control.}
<A>__{melkonis switches on his radio unit.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{this is deep space commercial vessel snark, registration number e180246, calling antarctica air traffic control. do you read me? over.}
<A>__{there is only the hiss of static.}
<C>__{broussard}
<P>__{(staring at a screen)}
<D>__{i don't recognize that constellation.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{dell, plot our location.}
<A>__{broussard goes into action, punching buttons, lighting up all his instruments.}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{i got it. oh boy.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{where the hell are we?}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{just short of zeta ii reticuli. we haven't even reached the outer rim yet.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{what the hell?}
<A>__{standard picks up a microphone.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{this is chaz speaking. sorry, but we are not home. our present location seems to be only halfway to irth. remain at your posts and stand by. that is all.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{chaz, i've got something here on my security alert. a high priority from the computer...}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{let's hear it.}
<C>__{roby}
<P>__{(punches buttons)}
<D>__{computer, you have signalled a priority three message. what is the message?}
<C>__{computer}
<P>__{(a mechanical voice)}
<D>__{i have interrupted the course of the voyage.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{what? why?}
<C>__{computer}
<D>__{i am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{computer, this is captain standard. what conditions are you talking about?}
<C>__{computer}
<D>__{i have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{a transmission?}
<C>__{computer}
<D>__{a voice transmission.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{out here?}
<A>__{the men exchange glances.}
<C>__{computer}
<D>__{i have recorded the transmission.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{play it for us, please.}
<A>__{over the speakers, we hear a hum, a crackle, static... then a strange, unearthly voice fills the room, speaking an alien language. the bizarre voice speaks a long sentence, then falls silent. the men all stare at each other in amazement.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{computer, what language was that?}
<C>__{computer}
<D>__{unknown.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{unknown! what do you mean?}
<C>__{computer}
<D>__{it is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.}
<A>__{there is a pause, then everybody starts talking at the same time.}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(silencing them)}
<D>__{just hold it, hold it !}
<P>__{(glares around the room)}
<D>__{computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?}
<C>__{computer}
<D>__{yes. there are two points of salient interest. number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin. number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{well, it's finally happened.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{first contact...}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{sandy, can you home in on that beam?}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{what's the frequency?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?}
<C>__{computer}
<D>__{65330 dash 99.}
<A>__{melkonis punches buttons.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{i've got it. it's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination 39 degrees 2 seconds.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{dell show me that on a screen.}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{i will give it to you on number four.}
<A>__{broussard punches buttons. one of the viewscreens flickers, and a small dot of light becomes visible in the corner of the screen.}
<C>__{broussard }
<D>__{that's it. let me straighten it out.}
<A>__{he twists a knob, moving the image on the screen till the dot is in the center.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{can you get it a little closer?}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{that's what i'm going to do.}
<A>__{he hits a button. the screen flashes and a planet appears.}
<C>__{broussard }
<D>__{planetoid. diameter, 120 kilometers.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{it's tiny!}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{any rotation?}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{yeah. two hours.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{gravity?}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{point eight six. we can walk on it.}
