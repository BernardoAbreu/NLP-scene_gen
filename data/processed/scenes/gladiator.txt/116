<L>__{exterior colosseum day}
<A>__{commodus, still swathed in the lion skin, his head down, slowly walks out on the platform that now extends from the imperial box. the crowd grows hushed. commodus reaches the end of the platform and waits for a moment. then he dramatically flings off the lion skin. the crowd gasps. he is almost naked, his entire chiseled body is painted in gold. his eyes are lost in an eerie reverie as he looks around at his people. he finally speaks:}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(serene)}
<D>__{rome... this is the day that was foretold. this is the day when your father takes away all fear...}
<P>__{(he holds up his hands)}
<D>__{with these hands i shall destroy your enemies so that you may sleep always and forever in peace. from this day forth let it be known that i, lucius aelius aurelius commodus, have surmounted mortality. that i, lucius aelius aurelius commodus, assume my destined place... at the side of the gods.}
<A>__{the crowd is stunned. a few scattered laughs. lucilla stares at him, disbelieving.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{and as a righteous god, i shall ever protect you. i shall cradle the world on my benevolent hands and clasp it to my heart. so i have spoken! and let the heavens tremble at my might!}
