<C>__{martin}
<D>__{ethan!}
<A>__{ethan turns. now faintly, little more than a shred of sound, is the distant blowing of a bugle.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{listen!... hear it?... there! ain't that a bugle... and firing?}
<A>__{ethan stares and then the bugle sound repeats and the distant crack of shots, from long miles off.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{just hope we ain't too late...}
<A>__{and the two break and run for their horses.}
