<L>__{exterior pembroke village day}
<A>__{forty of marion's men water their horses. marion, with the two great danes at his side, speaks with peter green, a middle aged storekeeper with a marked limp.}
<C>__{green}
<D>__{... four baskets of apples, salt pork, sweet potatoes, jerky, hard tack, salt and powder. it's not much, but i will get you more.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{we can't pay for this...}
<C>__{green}
<D>__{i will give you what i can, when i can. you pay me what you can.}
<A>__{green's daughter, anne, very attractive, around sixteen, joins them. gabriel sees her and sidles over.}
<C>__{green}
<D>__{francis, you remember my daughter, anne.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{nice to see you again, anne.}
<A>__{gabriel clears his throat. anne looks at him coolly.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i know who you are, gabriel marion. the last time i saw you, i was nine and you put ink in my tea.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i... uh... that wasn't me, it was samuel... i mean nathan...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{it was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{uh... uh... i...}
<C>__{green}
<D>__{he's sorry. come.}
<A>__{green heads across the square where some townspeople are giving marion's men provisions. anne and gabriel follow. marion turns to some waiting men, new recruits. billings, nearby, reads a posted broadsheet that announces: "reward offered: for the capture or death of the rebel known as 'the swamp fox'". he tears it down and walks over to marion.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{... and your terms of enlistment will be month to month. every thirty days you can re enlist or return to your families.}
<A>__{reed, the sturdiest of the lot offers his hand to marion.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{i'm in.}
<A>__{the others nod in agreement.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{talk to abner and scott about provisions, powder and mounts.}
<A>__{the recruits head off. billings hands marion the wanted poster which marion glances at and crumbles up.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{twenty men here, seventeen in new brighton, a dozen along the black river. we'll pass three hundred by week's end if this keeps up.}
<B>__{on the other side of the square}
<A>__{gabriel and several of marion's men take supplies from green, anne, and some other townspeople. gabriel looks at anne.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{if i'd known you were going to look like this, i never would have put ink in your tea.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you call that a compliment?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{it's a start.}
<A>__{she gives him a bit of a smile. he checks out her teeth.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{they look nice. as white as can be.}
<A>__{she tries to glare but she can't help but laugh. marion and billings watch as anne gives gabriel some apples which he tosses into the air, one by one, catching them behind his back, a cocky move, executed with a disarming smile that makes anne laugh again. marion smiles at his son's flirtation. billings smiles as well.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{he reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{no, he takes after his mother...}
<A>__{billings is taken aback by the gentleness of marion's words.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{... the younger ones barely remember her but gabriel spent more time with elizabeth... she taught him well, guided him, she was his north star and mine... her father was a minister, in boston, did you know that?}
<A>__{billings nods.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{... gabriel's already a better man than i could ever hope to be...}
<A>__{marion hears himself and pulls his eyes from gabriel, adopting a coarse, joking tone.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{what do you mean, old and ugly?}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{you got me beat on both accounts.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{the hell i do.}
<A>__{they mount up, grateful to leave the sincerity behind. gabriel sees marion and his men starting to ride off. he says goodbye to anne, then runs to his horse, mounting with a dramatic leap. he gallops up, taking his place at his father's side. marion doesn't turn to look at him, but he knows he's there.}
