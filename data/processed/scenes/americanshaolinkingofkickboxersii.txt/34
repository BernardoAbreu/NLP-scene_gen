<A>__{establishing shot of drew, ashema and old man, still sitting at the table, now lit by candles and a lantern. a bunch of tea bowls are scattered in front of drew, as if he's been drinking heavily. he points to his teacup, and ashema shakes her head.}
<C>__{ashema}
<D>__{you've had enough.}
<A>__{drew's shoulders slump even more.}

<A>__{the grandfather keeps talking, even though ashema and drew really don't want to listen.}
<C>__{ashema }
<D>__{he is telling a story about a monk who was refused admission into the temple. it broke his heart not to be allowed to be a monk.}
