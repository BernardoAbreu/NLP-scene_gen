<L>__{exterior neighborhood night semi long shot}
<A>__{the street is deserted. at the right hand side of the screen a light goes on. the camera pans over and we see that miss torso has returned from her date. she is wearing a three quarter length coat over her evening dress. she is inside, with the door two thirds closed, but she leans out to kiss someone goodnight. then it takes some coaxing to get the door completely closed. she turns the key in the lock. she listens a moment then comes to the center of the room. she takes her coat off and drapes it over chair. she removes the screen in front of the ice box, then opens the ice box. she searches it for something to eat; finds a big piece of pumpkin pie. she closes the ice box. she starts to eat the pie as she moves in the direction of the bathroom. stopping a moment, she puts the piece of pie on a table, and proceeds to take off her dress. undoing the zippers, she slides it over her head as she passes into the bathroom. the dress is thrown on a nearby chair, and the bare arm picks up a piece of pie. she is now in the bathroom. we see her slip down the brassiere straps, but the window does not permit us to see any lower. as she munches on the pie, she pulls out a few pins holding up her hair, which she proceeds to brush rhythmically. she turns and moves down her bare back.}
