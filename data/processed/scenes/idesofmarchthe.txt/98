<L>__{interior millennium hotel paul's room day}
<A>__{we're in paul's room. he's lying on the bed, talking on his cell phone. ben sits at the desk working on a laptop.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{absolutely there's no question about it ....}
<A>__{a knock. paul goes to the door, opens it and waves stephen in, shutting the door behind him as he enters.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{but we've got to think broader strokes here, rethink everything....uh huh....yeah, i know how to handle it....look,stevie just got here. can i call you back in a few}
<P>__{minutes? ..okay, bye. (he hangs up)}
<D>__{the governor. we had a good long talk on the way back. he's up to speed with everything.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{how'd he take it?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{better than i thought he would. still won't take thompson's endorsement.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{paul i gotta tell you something.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what's up?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{ida knows i met with duffy.}
<A>__{paul stares at him blankly.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{i don't know how she found out. tried to blackmail me. said she was gonna let the story out if i didn't tell her what happened at your meeting with thompson.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{so it's gonna hit the papers.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{probably. yeah. whoever she takes it to, they're gonna call me for a statement.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{i could just deny the whole thing, but if they call duffy and he admits to it, that could look worse. if i say no comment they won't let up.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i leaked it to ida.}
<A>__{pause. ben looks up from his laptop.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{at the event.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we made a deal.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{paul...they're gonna print that story in the paper tomorrow morning.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{but why? why would you do that to me? why would you do that to the campaign.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the campaign will survive.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{then why would you do that to me?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{makes it easier to let you go.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{why'd you meet with duffy?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i made a mistake a stupid mistake.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no stephen. you didn't make a mistake. you made a choice. you called me and left a message to call back...that it was important. but when i did...you said to forget about it. you chose not to tell me. why did you make that choice?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i didn't think it was important.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sure you did. but you went because you were curious, because you were flattered. because it made you feel special to think duffy wanted to speak to you instead of me. because you thought to yourself: maybe i can get something out of this. because it made you feel big. first campaign i ran tiny little race in kentucky state senate seat. workin for redneck nobody named mcguthrie. had no money, no staff, no fuckin office. everyone thought we didn't stand a chance. there's no way we can compete. and about this time, a guy running a congressional campaign a few districts over gives me a call. says, "i really like what you were able to do for poor ole' sam. but let's face it, he's a goner, so why don't you come work for me?" what do i do? well stephen this is where you and i are different. i told sam about the call. and sam says to me, "paul, you think this other's guy's got a shot at winning, and he can pay you more than anything i can afford, so if it's what you feel you need to do, then i won't get in your way." so i say, "sam you took a chance and hired me when i was even more of nobody than you are, and i'd be damned if i'm gonna jump ship just because the shit hit the fan." we lost the race, but three years later, when sam decided to run for governor who do you think he called? we won that race.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{and twenty years later i'm where i am now. (beat) there's only one thing i value in this world steve, and that's loyalty. without it you're nothing and you have no one. and in politics it's the only currency that you can count on. that's why i'm letting you go. not because you're not good enough. but i value trust over skill. and i don't trust you anymore.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{well it really isn't whether you trust me, it's whether the governor does.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the governor knows, he thinks it's the right thing to do.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{he does.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{if i were you? i'd get a good night sleep because you're gonna get fucking pounded by calls from the press in the morning...}
