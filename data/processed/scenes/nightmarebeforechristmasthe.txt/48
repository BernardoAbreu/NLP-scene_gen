<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior town hall. night.}
<A>__{the town hall is a tilted chautauqua meetinghouse. we hear the noise of the crowd inside and see a few halloweenland latecomers hurry in.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior town hall. night.}
<A>__{jack stands at a podium on a stage at the end of the big meeting hall. set up beside him is a table piled high with (at this point) non descripit objects. the murmuring crowd presses close to the stage. of course, sally and the evil scientist are absent. jack holds up his hands for attention.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{listen everyone. i want to tell you about where i've been!}
<A>__{he sings: >>>>> the town meeting song}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{there were objects so peculiar they were not to be believed all around things to tantalize my brain. it's a world unlike anything i've ever seen and as hard as i try... i can't seem to describe like a most improbable dream... but you must believe when i tell you this it's as real as my skull, and it does exist.}
<A>__{turning to sort through the objects on the table, jack speaks:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{here... let me show you.}
<A>__{the people press even closer.}
<C>__{people}
<D>__{ohhhh....}
<A>__{jack holds up a wrapped gift:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this is a thing called a present. the whole thing starts with a box...}
<C>__{various people}
<D>__{ a box? is it steel? are there locks? is it filled with a pox? a pox! how delightful, a pox!}
<A>__{jack interrupts their excited babbling:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{if you please!!!}
<A>__{he sings on:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{just a box with bright colored paper and the whole thing topped with a bow.}
<C>__{various people}
<D>__{ a bow? but why? how ugly! what's in it? what's in it?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that's the point of the thing, not to know!}
<C>__{various people}
<D>__{ it's a bat. will it bend? it's a rat. will it break? perhaps it's the head that i found in the lake.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{listen now, you don't understand. that's not the point of christmasland.}
<A>__{jack shakes his finger at them:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{now, pay attention.}
<A>__{he takes a christmas stocking off his display table and sings again:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{now we pick up an oversized sock... and bang it like this on the wall.}
<A>__{the irrepressible crowd bubbles over again:}
<C>__{various people}
<D>__{ oh yes, does it still have a foot? let me see... let me look... is it rotted and covered with gook?}
<A>__{jack is getting very frustrated:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{let me explain.}
<A>__{but to no avail...}
<C>__{various people}
<D>__{ small toys? do they bite? do they snap? or perhaps they just spring out and scare girls and boys.}
<A>__{the mayor struts to the front of the audience.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{what a splendid idea this christmas sounds fun. why i fully endorse it! let's try it at once!}
<A>__{but doubt immediately overtakes the mayor as jack expresses his exasperation with the way things are going...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{everyone, please, now not so fast. there's something here that you don't quite grasp.}
<A>__{confident face evaporating, the mayor skulks off. jack looks down at the faces tipped up toward him in the expressions, puzzlement replaces eagerness.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{well, i may as well give them what they want.}
<A>__{jack picks up his song again the showman once more:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and the best, i must confess, i have saved for the last for the ruler of this christmasland... is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice least, that is what i've come to understand. and i've also heard it told that he's something to behold like a lobster, huge and red... and sets out to slay with his raingear on, carting bulging sacks with his big great arms... that is, so i've heard it said.}
<A>__{listening to this, the people of halloweenland are absolutely spellbound, rapt, and quiet for a change.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{and on a dark, cold night under full moonlight he flies off into a fog like a vulture in the sky... and they call him sandy claws.}
<A>__{at this conclusion, a delightful shudder runs through the audience.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{ooooh....}
<A>__{they erupt into giddy chatter. jack watches them from the stage, then turns to his display table and begins gathering up his many christmasland souvenirs.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(sings wistfully to himself)}
<D>__{well, at least they're excited, but they don't understand that special kind of feeling ... in christmasland.}
<A>__{jack shakes a frosty the snowman paper weight and dreamily watches the little snowflakes drift down.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh well....}
<A>__{sighing, he packs his treasures.}
