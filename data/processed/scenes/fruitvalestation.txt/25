<D>__{already took it.}
<A>__{oscar puts his phone back into his pocket. he turns and begins to pump his gas. he sets the handle to automatically pump, and looks up and notices something. we see it is a gnarly looking male pit bull sniffing around a few feet from oscar's tires. it looks to be maybe 3 or 4 years old. oscar whistles at the dog and calls him over. oscar pets him on the head, we see its ears are a bit scarred, but it has beautiful brown eyes. he feels around the dog's neck no collar. oscar looks around for an owner for a beat while the dog licks his hand. click oscar's gas tank is full. he turns away from the dog, places the pump back on the base, and screws his fuel cap back in. he looks back to where the dog was and doesn't see him. he scans the block and panic strikes his face. he takes off running towards the street.}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{shit! no, no, no stop!}
<A>__{schreech... bam! we hear it before we see it. a sickening sound. an animal yelps, a car speeds off. oscar runs into the street chasing a car going too fast for us to see.}
<C>__{oscar }
<P>__{(at the car)}
<D>__{hey! stop you bitch ass muthafucka!!}
<A>__{he stops, turns around, and runs over to something lying in the street. it's the dog, and he's in bad shape. oscar picks the dog up out of the street, and places him on the sidewalk.}
<C>__{oscar }
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{come'on boy. come on.}
<A>__{the dog's breathing grows more struggled.}
<C>__{oscar }
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{shit.}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{somebody help! somebody fucking help!}
<A>__{oscar continues to pet his head. the dog starts to violently shake... he becomes unnaturally still. oscar stares at the dog for a long beat, shaken up by this. he looks around, no one seems to have noticed. he bends down, closes the dog's eyes, and heads for his car.}
