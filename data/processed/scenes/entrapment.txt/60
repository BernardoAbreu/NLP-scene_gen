<L>__{exterior street, shihlin district, taipei late night}
<A>__{ugly section of an ugly town. unmarked warehouses, alleyways teeming with food stalls. hear a motorcycle approach, and see... ...gin driving, mac sits behind her. going real fast, maybe she's showing off, we follow them down a blind alley, as she smoothly wheels them into... ...an open freight elevator. she climbs off, he doesn't. as gin goes to work the controls, mac sees a cat curled in the corner, mewing softly.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{that's madame chiang kaishek, she's my bud. an evil streak a mile wide.}
<A>__{the elevator jolts to life.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{no surprise.}
<A>__{they clang upward. mac seems utterly relaxed. gin paces a little, hugging herself. her features tense.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{tired?}
<A>__{she blinks up. he is straddling the bike. smiling at her.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i have a lot on my mind.}
<A>__{ah. well...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you look beautiful doing it.}
<A>__{he seems to mean that. and it seems to melt her a little. she sags against the wall, closing her eyes, as... ...they jolt to a stop. she pulls the heavy lever, and the door slides noisily open, to reveal... ...a gigantic loft. she flicks on a dim light, but we see only part of the cavernous space. she strolls, madame chiang trotting along behind. mac follows, looking around, then down to see... ...a pile of mail, cables, packages. the unopened mailing tube we saw in the hancock tower penthouse. he crouches, lifts the tube in his hands...}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{you wanna buy a vermeer?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{rather steal it.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{been there, done that.}
<A>__{he nods to himself. guess so. he rises to see her framed against the gaping starlit opening of a huge loading door. the twinkling island lies below. but here, gin stares down at... ...an elaborate architectural model. fifteen feet across, it features an imposing yellow, pagoda roofed building, built into the side of a model mountain. formal gardens, fountains, tiny kuomintang flags. stretching away from the building, a large portion of the city, with shops and alleyways elaborately detailed. as mac joins her...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{national palace museum, taipei, taiwan. repository of four thousand years of chinese culture...}
<A>__{he bends to lift up the detachable roof. all the rooms are detailed within, down to exhibit cases.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{works of gold, bronze, jade, onyx, pots and scrolls, paintings and porcelains and lacquer work. every treasure the kuomintang could loot before the reds took over.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ever rob the place?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{no. if memory serves.}
<A>__{she takes him by the hand, and leads him toward the gaping doorway, walking straight toward it...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you need to eat something, or are you ready for sex?}
<A>__{and just at the edge of it...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{the options seem so limited.}
<A>__{they jump through the opening. and vanish. our angle closes on the doorway, to see out now, sitting like a jewel against the hillside... ...the national palace museum, looking exactly like the model. the town spread out beyond. just as in the model. and now we tilt sharply down to see... ...a loading platform, suspended above the island, only a few feet below our opening. like a balcony without a railing. mac and gin already sinking down onto a waiting futon. looks like he's made his pick. among limited options.}
