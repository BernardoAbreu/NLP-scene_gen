<L>__{interior corridors in ship}
<A>__{roby, faust, and melkonis charge down the hallways until they arrive at:}
<L>__{interior corridor outside food storage room}
<A>__{standard and hunter are waiting for them, in hysterics.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{we saw it inside and slammed the door on it! it's in there now!}
<A>__{on the other side of the door, crashing and banging can be heard.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{what's it doing, having a seizure?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{it started crashing around right after we locked it in.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{now what?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{i guess we open the door and net it.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{i hate to open that door.}
<A>__{again the thing can be heard crashing around inside.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{it looks completely different from the first one it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{well we better do something.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{maybe we don't have to. it's trapped in there. we could just leave it in there all the way back to irth.}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(snaps)}
<D>__{don't be an idiot.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{i know what we can do. we can pump poison gas into the room and kill it. through those ventilator slots there.}
<A>__{he indicates a row of slots in the bottom of the door.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{hey, wait a minute! that's all our food supplies in there! we can't pump poison gas all over them!}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more we can go straight into hypersleep. also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{you win.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{somebody gimme a hand, i will get the stuff.}
