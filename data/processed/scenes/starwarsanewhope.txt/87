<A>__{ben watches luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker" robot. ben suddenly turns away and sits down. he falters, seems almost fainterior}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{are you all right? what's wrong?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i felt a great disturbance in the force... as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. i fear something terrible has happened.}
<A>__{ben rubs his forehead. he seems to drift into a trance. then he fixes his gaze on luke.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you'd better get on with your exercises.}
<A>__{han solo enters the room.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{well, you can forget your troubles with those imperial slugs. i told you i'd outrun 'em.}
<A>__{luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{don't everyone thank me at once.}
<A>__{threepio watches chewbacca and artoo who are engrossed in a game in which three dimensional holographic figures move along a chess type board.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{anyway, we should be at alderaan about oh two hundred hours.}
<A>__{chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table covered with small holographic monsters. each side of the table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. chewbacca seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur covered arms over his head.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{now be careful, artoo.}
<A>__{artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures to walk to the new square. a sudden frown crosses chewbacca's face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot. threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and begins to argue with the huge wookiee.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{he made a fair move. screaming about it won't help you.}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{let him have it. it's not wise to upset a wookiee.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{but sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{that's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. wookiees are known to do that.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{i see your point, sir. i suggest a new strategy, artoo. let the wookiee win.}
<A>__{luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems frozen in place. a humming lightsaber is held high over his head. ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements. han watches with a bit of smugness.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{remember, a jedi can feel the force flowing through him.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you mean it controls your actions?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{partially. but it also obeys your commands.}
<A>__{suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of luke, a "seeker", a chrome baseball like robot covered with antennae, hovers slowly in a wide arc. the ball floats to one side of the youth then the other. suddenly it makes a lightning swift lunge and stops within a few feet of luke's face. luke doesn't move and the ball backs off. it slowly moves behind the boy, then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood red laser beam as it attacks. it hits luke in the leg causing him to tumble over. han lets loose with a burst of laughter.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you don't believe in the force, do you?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{kid, i've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. i've seen a lot of strange stuff, but i've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all powerful force controlling everything. there's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.}
<A>__{ben smiles quietly.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{it's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i suggest you try it again, luke.}
<A>__{ben places a large helmet on luke's head which covers his eyes.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{this time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{with the blast shield down, i can't even see. how am i supposed to fight?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{your eyes can deceive you. don't trust them.}
<A>__{han skeptically shakes his head as ben throws the seeker into the air. the ball shoots straight up in the air, then drops like a rock. luke swings the lightsaber around blindly missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits luke square on the seat of the pants. he lets out a painful yell and attempts to hit the seeker.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{stretch out with your feelings.}
<A>__{luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. the seeker makes a dive at luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the bolt. the ball ceases fire and moves back to its original position.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you see, you can do it.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i call it luck.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{in my experience, there's no such thing as luck.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{look, going good against remotes is one thing. going good against the living? that's something else.}
<A>__{solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the control panel.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{looks like we're coming up on alderaan.}
<A>__{han and chewbacca head back to the cockpit.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you know, i did feel something. i could almost see the remote.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that's good. you have taken your first step into a larger world.}
