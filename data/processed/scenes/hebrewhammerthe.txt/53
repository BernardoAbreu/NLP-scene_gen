<A>__{the hammer's caddy cruises slowly down the street.}
<L>__{interior hammer's caddy continuous}
<A>__{things definitely seem odd. the hammer looks out his left window. two hasidic children decorate a giant christmas tree on the street. he looks to his right. a group of hasidic kids sing christmas carols. the hammer looks through his front windshield. a kid is standing right in the middle of the road! the hammer slams on his breaks, skidding to a stop just inches from the kid. it's shlomo (remember the kid the hammer helped with the yarmulke earlier?), and he has a strange glazed look in his eyes. shlomo holds a videocassette in his hand. the hammer steps out of the caddy, leaving his car door open. we hear the annoying beep, beep, beep door ajar sound.}

<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{huh.}
<A>__{the car door beeps again. the kid looks to it, and the hammer follows his gaze.}
<C>__{shlomo}
<D>__{mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings!}
<A>__{the hammer is baffled. he looks down at shlomo's hand and spots the videocassette. he grabs it from him and examines at it.}

<A>__{the hammer inspects the tape a little longer, and then gives the label a huge lick.}

<D>__{sixty five percent pure. damn! people could get hurt watching this shit.}
<P>__{(to shlomo)}
<D>__{come with me.}
<A>__{a pov shot from inside the hammer's trunk as it opens. hammer stands with shlomo. inside the trunk we see a box of videos. the three on top read, "fiddler on the roof," "yentl," and "chaim potok's the chosen." the hammer grabs a copy of the chosen and hands it to shlomo.}
<C>__{shlomo}
<D>__{chaim potok's the chosen?}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{get yourself home and watch this as soon as possible.}
<A>__{a hasidic kid on a bike with a christmas tree in tow rides past the two. one of the ornaments makes a tinkling sound.}

<D>__{mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings!}
<A>__{the hammer slaps him out of his spell.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{hey, hey, hey! you can beat this. now get going.}
