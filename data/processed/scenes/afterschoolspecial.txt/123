<A>__{deacon walks past his desk and something catches his eye. he stops to look at a picture of himself with fred and matt from fifth grade. he looks really happy in the picture. then, he sees a strip of photo booth pictures taken yesterday with naomi. she's hamming it up for the camera, but you can tell from his expression, they don't belong together. he tosses the naomi picture onto the desk.}
