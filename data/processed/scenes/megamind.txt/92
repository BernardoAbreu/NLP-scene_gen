<A>__{titan stumbles out of the bar, carrying a large sack of money.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{your time has come to an end, titan!}
<A>__{he looks up to see master mind suddenly standing before him.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{there can be only one master criminal in this city and it's me.}

<D>__{i have a better idea now!}
<A>__{two floors up da vinci releases a rope. a copper cage, like the one that caged uberman, drops down on top of titan. titan nonchalantly surveys the cage. he walks to the bars, tries to pull them apart but can't.}

<D>__{that's copper my good man. your one weakness.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{for all your amazing gifts of brawn you are no match for my intellect.}
<A>__{titan thinks for a moment. suddenly, he starts to spin like a human top, drilling himself into the street below. as he disappears beneath the surface, we see a shocked look on master mind's face until titan suddenly explodes out from under the street in front of him. master mind stares up at him, dumbfounded. titan makes like he's going to strike him down, but stops.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{you know what? you're nothing but a bug. not even worth my effort.}
<A>__{he turns his back to master mind and continues down the street. plato makes his way from the shadows to join his master. they watch titan shrink into the distance.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{he's not as dumb as i thought.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{i guess not...funny, though.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{what's funny?}
