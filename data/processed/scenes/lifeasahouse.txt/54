<A>__{sam glances out the window to check on his father, then quickly rummages through every drawer and cabinet looking for what he finds: a prescription bottle. it's vicodin. he checks on his dad through the window again, then opens the bottle and takes out five pills. he fills a glass with water and swallows two, saving three for later. he sets the bottle back where he found it before he drops on the bed with a grin.}
