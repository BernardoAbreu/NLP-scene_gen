<L>__{interior adam's bedroom night}
<A>__{adam jolts out of bed. his clothes are drenched in sweat. he looks down to see rachel sleeping peacefully next to him. he quickly gets out of bed and runs into the bathroom. and by the sound of it, throws up. a lot. rachel mutters something incoherent and then sprawls out, consuming the entire bed.}
<L>__{interior hospital. katie's office next day}
<A>__{adam looks worn and exhausted from the chemo. he's never felt worse.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{so how do you feel after your first treatment?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i feel like i was just gang raped by the buena vista social club.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{is everything with you going to be a joke?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i'm serious. have you heard their horn section?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{adam, you have a responsibility to your mind and body.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i was just injected with three pints of kryptonite. can we please hold off on the new agey stuff.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{you can't just sit there and ignore what's happening to you...you need to stop bottling everything up.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what i need is for people to stop telling me what i need.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{have you considered that this cancer is nature's way of telling you to change the way you live your life?}
<P>__{(off adam's look)}
<D>__{...there's an old saying you can't change the wind, but you can adjust the sails.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{they teach you that in medical school?}
<A>__{katie's patience is waning.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i know you don't like to talk about your feelings, but you have to learn to find an outlet.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{an outlet for what? i have cancer.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{and how is your body ever going to fight the stress of that cancer if you can't even handle your own emotions?}
<A>__{adam snaps, rasing his voice.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well excuse me. you'll have to forgive me for not having a firm handle on my emotions at this particular juncture of my life.}
<A>__{katie's a little shaken by adam's outburst. she stays firm.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{you don't have to be here.}
<A>__{adam knows he went too far. plus, that little outburst lifted a little wight off his shoulders, and he knows it.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i know you're only trying to help.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{this is all too much for me. i don't know what to do. just tell me what to do and i will do it.}
<A>__{katie looks at adam, is he being for real? she's skeptical.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i want you to do some homework. here's a list of books on mind body therapy. they should help you get started.}
<A>__{katie hands adam a sheet of paper with a list of books scribbled on it.}
