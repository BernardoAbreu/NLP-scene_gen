<A>__{cabinent photograph (full screen) of kane as an old, old man. this image remains constant on the screen (as camera pulls back, taking in the interior of a dark projection room.}
<L>__{interior projection room day }
<A>__{a fairly large one, with a long throw to the screen. it is dark. the image of kane as an old man remains constant on the screen as camera pulls back, slowly taking in and registering projection room. this action occurs, however, only after the first few lines of encuring dialogue have been spoken. the shadows of the men speaking appear as they rise from their chairs black against the image of kane's face on the screen. note: these are the editors of a "news digest" short, and of the rawlston magazines. all his enterprises are represented in the projection room, and rawlston himself, that great man, is present also and will shortly speak up. during the entire course of this scene, nobody's face is really seen. sections of their bodies are picked out by a table light, a silhouette is thrown on the screen, and their faces and bodies are themselves thrown into silhouette against the brilliant slanting rays of light from the projection room. a third man is on the telephone. we see a corner of his head and the phone.}
<C>__{third man}
<P>__{(at phone)}
<D>__{stand by. i will tell you if we want to run it again.}
<P>__{(hangs up)}
<C>__{thompson's voice}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{a short pause.}
<C>__{a man's voice}
<D>__{it's a tough thing to do in a newsreel. seventy years of a man's life }
<A>__{murmur of highly salaried assent at this. rawlston walks toward camera and out of the picture. others are rising. camera during all of this, apparently does its best to follow action and pick up faces, but fails. actually, all set ups are to be planned very carefully to exclude the element of personality from this scene; which is expressed entirely by voices, shadows, sillhouettes and the big, bright image of kane himself on the screen.}
<C>__{a voice}
<D>__{see what arthur ellis wrote about him in the american review?}
<C>__{third man}
<D>__{i read it.}
<C>__{the voice}
<P>__{(its owner is already}
<D>__{leaning across the table, holding a piece of paper under the desk light and reading}
<P>__{from it)}
<D>__{listen: kane is dead. he contributed to the journalism of his day the talent of a mountebank, the morals of a bootlegger, and the manners of a pasha. he and his kind have almost succeeded in transforming a once noble profession into a seven percent security no longer secure.}
<C>__{another voice}
<D>__{that's what arthur ellis is writing now. thirty years ago, when kane gave him his chance to clean up detroit and chicago and st. louis, kane was the greatest guy in the world. if you ask me }
<C>__{another voice}
<D>__{charles foster kane was a...}
<A>__{then observations are made almost simultaneous.}
<C>__{rawlston's voice}
<D>__{just a minute!}
<A>__{camera moves to take in his bulk outlined against the glow from the projection room.}
<C>__{rawlston}
<D>__{what were kane's last words?}
<A>__{a silence greets this.}
<C>__{rawlston}
<D>__{what were the last words he said on earth? thompson, you've made us a good short, but it needs character }
<C>__{somebody's voice}
<D>__{motivation }
<C>__{rawlston}
<D>__{that's it motivation. what made kane what he was? and, for that matter, what was he? what we've just seen are the outlines of a career what's behind the career? what's the man? was he good or bad? strong or foolish? tragic or silly? why did he do all those things? what was he after?}
<P>__{(then, appreciating his point)}
<D>__{maybe he told us on his death bed.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{yes, and maybe he didn't.}
<C>__{rawlston}
<D>__{ask the question anyway, thompson! build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{i know, but }
<C>__{rawlston}
<P>__{(riding over him}
<D>__{like any other}
<P>__{producer)}
<D>__{all we saw on that screen was a big american }
<C>__{a voice}
<D>__{one of the biggest.}
<C>__{rawlston}
<P>__{(without pausing for this)}
<D>__{but how is he different from ford? or hearst for that matter? or rockefeller or john doe?}
<C>__{a voice}
<D>__{i know people worked for kane will tell you not only in the newspaper business look how he raised salaries. you don't want to forget }
<C>__{another voice}
<D>__{you take his labor record alone, they ought to hang him up like a dog.}
<C>__{rawlston}
<D>__{i tell you, thompson a man's dying words }
<C>__{somebody's voice}
<D>__{what were they?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{somebody's voice}
<P>__{(hesitant)}
<D>__{yes, mr. rawlston, what were kane's dying words?}
<C>__{rawlston}
<P>__{(with disgust)}
<D>__{rosebud!}
<A>__{a little ripple of laughter at this, which is promptly silenced by rawlston.}
<C>__{rawlston}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{a voice}
<D>__{tough guy, huh?}
<P>__{(derisively)}
<D>__{dies calling for rosebud!}
<C>__{rawlston}
<D>__{here's a man who might have been president. he's been loved and hated and talked about as much as any man in our time but when he comes to die, he's got something on his mind called "rosebud." what does that mean?}
<C>__{another voice}
<D>__{a racehorse he bet on once, probably, that didn't come in rosebud!}
<C>__{rawlston}
<D>__{all right. but what was the race?}
<A>__{there is a short silence.}
<C>__{rawlston}
<D>__{thompson!}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{rawlston}
<D>__{hold this thing up for a week. two weeks if you have to...}
<C>__{thompson}
<P>__{(feebly)}
<D>__{but don't you think if we release it now he's only been dead four days it might be better than if }
<C>__{rawlston}
<P>__{(decisively)}
<D>__{nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick. go after the people that knew kane well. that manager of his the little guy, bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts }
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{i don't mean go through the city directory, of course }
<A>__{the third man gives a hearty "yes man" laugh.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{i will get to it right away, mr. rawlston.}
<C>__{rawlston}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{good!}
<A>__{the camera from behind him, outlines his back against kane's picture on the screen.}
<C>__{rawlston's voice}
<D>__{it'll probably turn out to be a very simple thing...}
