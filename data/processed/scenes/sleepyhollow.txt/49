<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{wait. give me a moment...}
<A>__{ichabod kneels. he removes the woven piece, looking across the diseased lenape's body. something else... the lenape's mouth is agape; teeth rotting. ichabod looks around, finds a twig. he uses it to pull the lenape's mouth open... gets close to peer inside the lenape's mouth.}
