<L>__{interior limousine evening}
<A>__{chance and eve settle in the back seat. as they talk, david starts up the limo, jeffrey joins him in front and the limo pulls out into traffic.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i hope you're comfortable.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. i am.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{these can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to do over a simple little accident. of course, they can be very frightening, and i must apologize for david, he's never had an accident before.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. he's a very careful driver.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{... why, yes, he is... is your leg feeling any better?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{it's feeling better, but it's still very sore.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i see.}
<P>__{(a thought)}
<D>__{... say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(doesn't understand)}
<D>__{your family doctor?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{yes. my husband has been very ill. his doctor and nurses are staying with us. those hospitals can be so impersonal why, it might be hours before you are treated...}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i agree.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you...}
<P>__{(leans forward)}
<D>__{david, we'll just go on home. jeffrey, would you call and let them know?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{yes ma'am.}
<A>__{eve presses a button, the glass partition closes. as the window rolls up behind him, jeffrey dials the limo telephone. there is a moment of silence. eve, still a bit on edge from the accident and feeling a bit uncomfortable with a stranger in the car, presses another button. the limo's bar moves out, revealing a row of decanters and glasses.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{would you care for a drink?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. thank you.}
<A>__{as eve pours cognac into a monogrammed crystal glass, chance notices the limo's tv set.}
<C>__{chance }
<D>__{i would like to watch television.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(a bit surprised)}
<D>__{oh? certainly...}
<A>__{she hands chance the cognac, turns on the tv.}
<C>__{eve }
<D>__{oh, by the way i'm eve rand.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{hello, eve.}
<A>__{chance takes a sip of the cognac, is not accustomed to alcohol, coughs. there is another moment of silence.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{may i ask your name?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(with a slight cough)}
<D>__{my name is chance.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{pardon me, was that mr. chance?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(still indistinct)}
<D>__{no. i'm a gardener.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{oh... mr. gardiner... mr. chauncey gardiner... you're not related to basil and perdita gardiner are you?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{no, eve. i'm not related to basil and perdita.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{oh. well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. we visit their island quite often.}
<A>__{chance reaches out to change the channel on the tv, suddenly realizes he doesn't have his remote control. he starts going through his pockets, searches for it.}
<C>__{eve }
<D>__{did you lose something?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. i lost my remote control.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{oh... well, i'm very sorry...}
<A>__{another pause, chance reaches out, changes channels on tv.}
<C>__{eve }
<D>__{... i will feel so relieved after dr. allenby examines your leg. after that, david can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...}
<P>__{(chance still watches tv)}
<D>__{... is there anything special you would like to watch?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i like to watch. this is fine.}
<A>__{chance watches the news. eve sips on her cognac as david eases the limo out of the city of washington.}
