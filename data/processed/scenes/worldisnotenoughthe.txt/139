<L>__{interior test chamber continuous}
<A>__{ahead of bond, like a deadly spider at the centre of a web, a nuclear bomb suspended over a pit. blast openings range around to channel its fury to measuring equipment. bond is alone with the bomb. an eerie moment. then, he comes to notice a figure, across the expanse of the pit, on the opposite side of the catwalk, a man, with his back to him, in russian army fatigues.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{corporal?}
<A>__{the man turns...}
<B>__{it is renard.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{i see my friend davidov ran into some difficulty.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{indeed.}
<A>__{renard starts toward him. bond draws his gun.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{don't come any closer.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you can't kill me. i'm already dead.}
<A>__{he and bond face off, the malevolent bomb between them, a robot device beginning to lower it into the pit.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{go ahead. shoot. my men will still steal the bomb, and the shot will bring them directly to you.}
<A>__{renard gestures into the pit. bond's p.o.v. two of renard's men in the pit, unaware of what is happening above, working directly with the bomb. one of them is using a manual...it is just like the stolen report, the miratom seal in the corner. bond aims his gun at renard's head.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{who's paying you to destroy the pipeline?}
<A>__{renard resumes walking, around the catwalk at the edge of the pit, toward bond, slowly, surely, totally fearless.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{to die by a man who can't even grasp what he's caught up in...}
<A>__{bond, out of the corner of his eye, sees renard's man remove a small device from inside the bomb. it is the size and shape of a credit card, black, with shiny transistors on it...the man slips it into his pocket.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{revenge isn't so hard to fathom. what's clever is getting someone else to pay for it.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.}
<A>__{bond cocks the pistol.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{who is it?}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{you think i fear death? i welcome it. i get on my knees and pray for it. you, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?}
<P>__{(closer now)}
<D>__{she's beautiful isn't she? you should have seen her before. flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...}
<A>__{bond's eyes flare in fury. he shoves renard into the wall and presses the gun to his temple.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{you will never touch her. you will never get near her.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{consider me ungrateful.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{it's i who should thank you for taking that money back to mi 6. so distressing for m. an explosion inside her lair.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{she'll get over it.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{you even brought the plane for us. we really couldn't have done it without you.}
<A>__{bond strikes him across the temple with his pistol. renard drops to his knees. he touches his temple, looks at the blood curiously, feeling no pain.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{a man tires of being executed.}
<A>__{as bond screws a silencer onto the muzzle of his gun:}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{but then again...there is no point in living if you can't...feel alive.}
<A>__{bond knows that, he's heard it somewhere before...it freezes him, just a beat, but it is enough... suddenly, the noise of footsteps christmas jones, with colonel akakievich and two armed soldiers. we're with them as they turn the corner of the passageway and see bond with silenced pistol aimed at the kneeling renard classic execution stance:}
<C>__{colonel akakievich}
<P>__{(to bond)}
<D>__{drop your gun.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{keep away, colonel.}
<A>__{the soldiers' guns are trained on bond.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{he is an impostor.}
<P>__{(clutching a printout)}
<D>__{there's no davidov at miratom.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{here's your imposter. he's paid off the men on the plane outside. they're not taking the bomb to any russian facility, they're flying it wherever he tells them.}
<A>__{christmas is listening, but akakievich cocks his rifle.}
<C>__{colonel akakievich}
<P>__{(to bond)}
<D>__{i said drop it.}
<A>__{and he means business. bond delays ... but has no choice. he pulls the clip from his gun, tosses it down.}
<C>__{renard}
<P>__{(to christmas)}
<D>__{well done he would have killed us all. i suppose you}
<P>__{(to akakievich)}
<D>__{were you the one who allowed him down?}
<A>__{colonel akakievich looks suitably stung. but renard is looking past him now, as with a quiet whirr, the bomb raises into view on a trolley. renard's team is ready to move.}
<C>__{renard}
<P>__{(to akakievich)}
<D>__{take him away, i don't want him around as we move the bomb.}
<P>__{(whispered, to bond)}
<D>__{you had me. i knew you couldn't shoulder the responsibility...}
<A>__{and renard jams his hand onto bond's shoulder, squeezing his collar bone hard... pain jolts through bond, he drops to his knees in agony. he shoves bond down. bond's hand goes to his shoulder, his mind now racing how did he know to hurt him there? renard's men start to maneuver the bomb toward the curving passageway. it's all too much for colonel akakievich:}
<C>__{colonel akakievich}
<D>__{no the bomb does not go anywhere until i am satisfied. all of you to the surface, now...}
<A>__{renard stops and turns. bond sees him nod to two of his men: one quietly slopes off down the tunnel. the other innocently opens a container...}
