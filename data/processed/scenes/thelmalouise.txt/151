<C>__{hal}
<D>__{son, i gotta feelin' about somethin' and i just wanna ask your opinion. do you think thelma dickinson would have committed armed robbery if you hadn't taken all their money?}
<A>__{j.d. doesn't say anything. they both just sit there for a moment.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{cat got your tongue?}
<A>__{j.d. shifts in his chair.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{how do you know i took it? how do you know they didn't just give it to me?}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{there's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...! and you blew it for 'em. now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, i'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them. i've got no feelin' for you. but i may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance i can actually do them some good, or i'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life. your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life. that's a sincere promise.}
<A>__{hal walks over and opens the door and max and the others straggle back in.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out. and you know judge hainey. he hates this sort of thing. once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high. and then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, i think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{oh, definitely.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<P>__{(convinced)}
