<L>__{interior board room, parrish communications day}
<A>__{parrish enters, joe following right behind him. a euphony of "good morning"'s from the various members of the board, including quince. everyone sits when parrish does but joe, right at home, spots a tray of refreshments: coffee, pas tries, he heads for them.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(to the board)}
<D>__{ this is joe black, a personal associate of mine uh he'll be joining us today. i know it's uh unusual, and my apologies and drew uh carry on.}
<A>__{immediately indications of surprise on board members' faces at parrish bringing in an 'observer', drew's reaction guarded but intense.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(after a moment, to joe)}
<D>__{nice to see you. i didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to the board)}
<D>__{the board of parrish communications is hereby called to order. our sole order of business is an acceptance of john bontecou's generous offer and }
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to drew)}
<D>__{do you have any more of these deli cious cookies?}
<A>__{a hushed silence at the inappropriateness of joe's inter ruption.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{and a cup of tea. with milk, i think. i'd like to try it english style. yes, a cup of tea with milk.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{anything else, mr. black? how about some water?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{why yes, thank you.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{hot or cold.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{cold.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{and a glass.}
<A>__{drew indicates to the board's stenographer to arrange joe's refreshments.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(quietly, indicating a chair)}
<D>__{would you like to sit down, joe?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{joe sits.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{to review we're really crossing the 't's and dotting the 'i's here. bill had a great and conclusive meeting with john bontecou yester day, all that remains for us is to put it to a vote.}
<A>__{smiles and murmurs of a congratulatory receptiveness from the board at drew's news.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(emptily)}
<D>__{thank you, drew.}
<A>__{parrish takes a moment, draws himself up to say something official then stops himself, what follows is spontaneous, reflective, deeply felt.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{umm i did enjoy or rather i was interested in meeting john yes terday impressive... i suppose... but it did get me to thinking. i started in this business because this is what i wanted to do. i knew i wasn't going to write the great american novel, but i also knew there was more to life than buying something for a dollar and selling it for two. i wanted to give the news to the world, and i wanted to give it unvarnished. the more we all know about each other, the greater the chance we will survive. sure, i want to make a profit, you can't exist without one but john bontecou is all profit. if we give him license to absorb parrish communications, and he has his eye on a few others after us, we'll be appointing him to the position he craves gatekeeper. in order to reach the world you will have to go through john bontecou. and not only will you have to pay him to do this, far more expensive, you'll have to agree with him. reporting the news is a privilege and a responsibility and it is not exploitable. parrish communications has earned this priv ilege, john bontecou wants to buy it. as your chairman, i urge you to agree this company is not for sale.}
<A>__{a silence, everybody shifts, the board is in shock, drew is trying to maintain his balance.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{...sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(to the board)}
<D>__{sorry. i know it looks like i'm reversing my field.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{that's your privilege, bill. but given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu ture, the truth is... joining john bontecou is every bit as certain as death and taxes.}
<A>__{joe interjects:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{'death and taxes'?}
<A>__{after a moment.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{"death and taxes"?}
<A>__{another moment.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what an odd pairing.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{it's just a saying, mr. black,}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{of whom?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{it doesn't matter.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{then why did you bring it up?}
<A>__{drew regards joe.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you're not familiar with the phrase, "in this world, nothing is certain but death and taxes"?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i am now.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{glad i could be of some help.}
<A>__{the board is provoked and mystified by joe and even more by his presence, they cast meaningful glances at parrish, drew coolly grasps the irritation of the members. parrish breaks the silence.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{shall we adjourn?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{but the matter's still on the table, bill }
<A>__{edward sloane, a contemporary of parrish's, has been warily silent, but extremely observant. protective of parrish, and sensing his burgeoning difficulty, he interrupts:}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{why don't we let it rest for the moment? give it some air?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{well said, eddie. mr. black, shall we?}
<A>__{joe rises.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to drew)}
<D>__{those cookies were excellent.}
<A>__{he exits with parrish, the door closes behind them. a babble of disturbed reactions from the board.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{who is that guy?}
<A>__{drew grabs a telephone:}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{felicia?}
<C>__{felicia }
<D>__{yes, sir?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{get me a field background check on joe black. litigations. bankrupt cies. credit ratings. the works. got it?}
<A>__{drew hangs up.}
