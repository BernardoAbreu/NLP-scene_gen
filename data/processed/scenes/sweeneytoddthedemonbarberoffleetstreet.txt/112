<L>__{interior bakehouse night}
<A>__{mrs. lovett is standing in horror by the mouth of the chute. the judge, still barely alive, clutches at her skirt she tries to wrench herself away from his vise like grip }
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{die! die! god in heaven die!}
<A>__{the judge's fingers finally relax their grip; he is dead. panting, mrs. lovett, backs away from him and for the first time notices the body of the beggar woman.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{you! can it be? have all the demons of hell come to torment me?!}
<A>__{she grabs the beggar woman and starts dragging her quickly toward the oven as todd races in:}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{why did you scream? does the judge live still?}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{he was clutching, holding on to my dress, but he's finished now...}
<A>__{she continues quickly dragging the beggar woman toward the oven.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{leave them to me. open the doors.}
<A>__{he waves her toward the oven }
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{no! don't touch her!}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{open the doors!}
<A>__{he shoves her toward the oven and leans over to pick up the beggar woman's body }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what's the matter with you? it's only a silly old beggar }
<A>__{then mrs. lovett opens the oven doors the thundering roar from the oven crashes through the room as the fiery light slashes across the floor clearly illuminating the face of the beggar woman. a chord of music as todd realizes who she is. music continues and builds as:}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{oh no! ... oh god ... "don't i know you?" she said ...}
<A>__{he looks up to mrs. lovett:}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you knew she lived. from the moment that i came into your shop you knew my lucy lived!}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{i was only thinking of you!}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(looking down again)}
<D>__{lucy...}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{your lucy! a crazy hag picking bones and rotten spuds out of alley ashcans! would you have wanted to know she ended up like that?}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{you lied to me...}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{no, no, not lied at all. no, i never lied.}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(to beggar woman)}
<D>__{lucy...}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{said she took the poison she did never said that she died poor thing, she lived }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i've come home again...}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{but it left her weak in the head, all she did for months was just lie there in bed }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{lucy...}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{should've been in hospital, wound up in bedlam instead, poor thing!}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{oh, my god...}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{better you should think she was dead.}
<P>__{(passionately)}
<D>__{yes, i lied 'cos i love you!}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{lucy...}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{i'd be twice the wife she was! i love you! could that thing have cared for you like me?}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(a harrowing keen)}
<D>__{what have i done?!}
<A>__{todd's eyes suddenly snap up to mrs. lovett as the glorious "little priest" waltz theme returns }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{mrs. lovett, you're a bloody wonder, eminently practical and yet appropriate as always, as you've said repeatedly, there's little point in dwelling on the past.}
<A>__{he steps toward her, she steps back, unsure, as they sing simultaneously:}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no, come here, my love... not a thing to fear, my love... what's dead is dead.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{do you mean it? everything i did i swear i thought was only for the best, believe me!}
<P>__{(a heartbreaking plea)}
<D>__{can we still be married?}
<A>__{todd steps toward her darkly. she knows she is doomed. but steps into his arms anyway for a final, triumphant waltz:}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{the history of the world, my pet }
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<P>__{(through tears)}
<D>__{oh, mr. todd, ooh, mr. todd, leave it to me...}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{is learn forgiveness and try to forget.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<P>__{(the lost dream)}
<D>__{by the sea, mr. todd, we'll be comfy cozy, by the sea, mr. todd, where there's no one nosy...}
<A>__{he waltzes her toward the roaring oven. she offers no resistance, fully aware of what's coming. the blazing, thundering inferno of the oven makes it seem they are the damned, dancing through hell.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{and life is for the alive, my dear, so let's keep living it !}
<C>__{both}
<D>__{just keep living it, really living it !}
<A>__{the music reaches a thundering crescendo as he flings her into the oven and slams the doors we hear her screaming. and banging on the oven doors. todd sinks to his knees and covers his ears desperately as the banging and screaming and music finally fade to silence. then he slowly drags himself across the floor to the beggar woman. he cradles her head in his arms.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{there was a barber and his wife, and she was beautiful. a foolish barber and his wife, she was his reason and his life. and she was beautiful. and she was virtuous. and he was...}
<A>__{todd folds himself over his dead wife. the only sound his deep, anguished sobs. a long beat. then he becomes aware of something. he looks over to see.... toby staring at him from the open sewer grate. he has seen everything. todd watches as toby silently pulls himself up. todd gently sets lucy down and then, still kneeling, turns to face toby. a long beat as they look at each other. then toby slowly moves and carefully picks up todd's razor. todd looks at him. then slowly unbuttons his collar and exposes his neck. he bends his head back, offering his naked throat. toby slowly goes to him and methodically slits his throat. todd continues to gaze up at toby as we hear the lonely sound of wind escaping from his severed wind pipe. then toby turns and leaves the bakehouse. todd leans forward, dying. we cut to his point of view: the rough brick floor... from the bottom of the frame... a dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up the frame ... the fiery glow from the bake oven reflected in the blood... finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame. we realize this is the first image we saw in the story. todd's perspective. todd's blood. as he dies. as before, the gentleman's face appears, reflected in the pool of blood...}
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{attend the tale of sweeney todd, his skin was pale and his eye was odd.}
<A>__{the banker emerges from the shadows of the bakehouse...}
<C>__{banker}
<D>__{he shaved the faces of gentlemen who never thereafter were heard of again.}
<A>__{the general emerges ... and the tourist ... and the priest ... and the student...}
<C>__{ghosts}
<P>__{(variously)}
<D>__{he trod a path that few have trod, did sweeney todd, the demon barber of fleet street.}
<A>__{then a new ghost ... a face we recognize ... the beggar woman...}
<C>__{beggar woman}
<D>__{he kept a shop in london town, of fancy clients and good renown.}
<A>__{she is joined by the judge...}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{and what if none of their souls were saved? they went to their maker impeccably shaved. beggar woman, judge and ghosts by sweeney, by sweeney todd, the demon barber of fleet street.}
<A>__{the beadle and pirelli join the ghosts...}
<C>__{pirelli and beadle}
<D>__{swing your razor wide, sweeney! hold it to the skies! freely flows the blood of those who moralize!}
<A>__{the ghosts move around the bakehouse, considering the meat grinder and stained cleavers and chopping block...}
<C>__{ghosts}
<P>__{(variously)}
<D>__{his needs are few, his room is bare. he hardly uses his fancy chair. the more he bleeds, the more he lives. he never forgets and he never forgives. perhaps today you gave a nod to sweeney todd. the demon barber of fleet street.}
<A>__{hunting like predators, we begin to move urgently through the ghosts. their long shadows tower bizarrely against the walls and ceiling of the bakehouse. the fiery red roar of the bake oven builds in intensity...}
<C>__{ghosts}
<P>__{(variously)}
<D>__{sweeney wishes the world away, sweeney's weeping for yesterday, hugging the blade, waiting the years, hearing the music that nobody hears. sweeney waits in the parlor hall, sweeney leans on the office wall. no one can help, nothing can hide you isn't that sweeney there beside you? sweeney wishes the world away, sweeney's weeping for yesterday, is sweeney! there he is, it's sweeney! sweeney! sweeney!}
<A>__{we tear through them with increasing frenzy cutting quickly, vertiginous angles as the music builds }
<C>__{ghosts}
<P>__{(variously)}
<D>__{there! there! there! there! there! there! there!}
<P>__{(almost a scream now)}
<D>__{there!}
<A>__{they move away revealing todd and mrs. lovett. facing each other. we circle them:}
<C>__{ghosts}
<D>__{attend the tale of sweeney todd! he served a dark and a hungry god!}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(sharply to mrs. lovett)}
<D>__{to seek revenge may lead to hell.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<P>__{(coldly to him)}
<D>__{but everyone does it, if seldom as well }
<C>__{todd and mrs. lovett}
<D>__{ as sweeney...}
<C>__{ghosts}
<D>__{as sweeney todd... the demon barber of fleet...}
<A>__{the ghosts begin to disappear ... fading into the shadows of the bakehouse ... leaving todd and mrs. lovett alone...}
<C>__{ghosts}
<D>__{... street!}
<A>__{the febrile music continues as todd and mrs. lovett stand alone, continuing to glare at each other. finally she gives him a grim little smile and disappears into the darkness. he stands alone. and we cut to a series of images from earlier in our story, cut to the music todd's life flashing before his eyes the images building as the music races toward its conclusion todd singing slashing smiling striding the final crash of music at the final image: todd kneeling, hunched over the pool of blood on the bakehouse floor. he falls... into the blood. dead. snap to black.}
