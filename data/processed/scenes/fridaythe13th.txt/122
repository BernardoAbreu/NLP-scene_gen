<L>__{interior camp kitchen late afternoon}
<A>__{the kitchen and the main meeting room are really one in the same room, cut off by a partition. the kitchen has a couple of sinks, a heavy old stove, long shelves, a pantry larder, and some windows which look out on the rear. brenda is making a salad for herself. she is a vegetarian. marcie is making a guacamole dip. in the big room there is a fireplace and a ping pong table. jack and bill are playing.}

<A>__{alice smiles. nods.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{the way i feel, that's perfect.}
<A>__{alice goes to the sink and begins to work her way through the dirty dish pan. ned comes flying through the door dressed in various bits and pieces of old indian costumery. he does a bad dance. jack and bill quit their game and come to the doorway.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what the hell?}
<C>__{bill}

<A>__{he takes a letter out of his breechclout. he pretends to read, when really we can see that the paper is blank.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(improvising)}
<D>__{dear mom and dad, camp blood is real fine except for the strange man who flies at night and sucks our counsellor's body...}
<A>__{alice leans against the sink and laughs. she is a very pretty girl, younger than she first appeared.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and, mommy, we really love our counsellor. he says that whenever i'm scared, i can sleep in his bunk with him.}
<A>__{jack and bill laugh. ned takes off his headdress.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{no wonder they lost america. how could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? what's to eat?}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{whatever you make yourself.}
<A>__{alice looks up from her dishes and cocks her head to the side. does she sees something? the camera pans slowly to look over her shoulder. the window pane is dirty and it's a bit difficult to see, but there is something standing there out by a cabin. but it stands, doesn't move... is it a building?}
