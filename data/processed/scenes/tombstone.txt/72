<L>__{int oriental night}
<A>__{morgan is by himself in the empty saloon, calmly shooting pool, his dog jumping enthusiastically at every shot as wyatt enters.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{get down, boy.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{morgan, are you crazy? they're out gunning for us! what the hell're you doin'?}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{what's it look like? they want a piece of me they can come and get it, i'm not crawlin' into my hole.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{morg, use your head.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{i am usin' it, wyatt. been wonderin' how the hell we got in this tangle. you know they hit clum's house, too? shot up his wife. his wife. who ever heard of that? men sneakin' around in the dark, back shootin', scarin' women? they're bugs, wyatt. you know all your smart talk about live and let live? ain't no live and let live with bugs.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{i know, i was wrong. but morg, look, we got to get out.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{listen to yourself, wyatt. lie down and crawl or you might get hurt? what kinda talk is that? that's virgil lyin' over there, wyatt. our own brother. ruined for life. no sir, i ain't going no place. you want to go, fine. i'm stayin' right here and have it out with those bastards.}
<A>__{morgan pulls back his vest, revealing virgil's badge. wyatt drops into a corner chair, defeated. morgan makes a shot, leaving only the 8 ball. a few beats. seeing wyatt's misery, morgan softens, poking him with the cue. wyatt looks up. morgan taps the middle pocket. wyatt shakes his head.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{how much you wanna bet?}
<A>__{wyatt holds up his watch. morgan frowns. wyatt raises his brows:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{i just got it fixed.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{you're on.}
<A>__{morgan has to lean over the table but he sinks the 8 ball, looking over at wyatt in triumph. wyatt applauds, rolling his eyes just as a bullet spangs into the wall by his head. wyatt dives for the floor as another shot pierces the window. wyatt jumps up, bounding to the door to see several figures cash into the darkness. wyatt turns back and freezed. morgan lies across the table with one leg dangling over the edge, jerking and shuddering involuntarily. wyatt rushes to him. the dog whines as doc rushes in with kate and mcmasters. wyatt is trembling.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{no, no! get the doctor! jesus christ!}
