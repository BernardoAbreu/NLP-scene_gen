<B>__{day}
<A>__{sara exits, looking pretty much like she feels. like shit. she walks a few paces. sees patrick. their eyes connect for a brief, awful moment before they continue on their respective ways.}

<B>__{later that day}
<A>__{sara's at her locker. patrick walks up to her. she looks at him, tries to smile past the dour expression on his face.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{patrick doesn't say anything at first. but then:}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{thought you might need this on saturday. i ain't gonna be able to make it.}
<A>__{he hands her an audio cassette of her free form music. sara gazes at it, then up at him, understanding what this means. she won't let him see how it shatters her. he hesitates, as if he wants to say something else. but sara turns her back on him and patrick walks away. another angle toni approaching sara's locker. having seen the encounter between patrick and sara, she's as smug and overbearing as ever.}
<C>__{toni}
<D>__{lovers' quarrel? you're better off. that menace to society would've broken your heart and spent all your money in a news flash. trust me on that, sara.}
<A>__{sara stares at her, uncomprehending at first. she resists the urge to slap the smile off toni's face. she gets in it instead.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{toni, listen carefully. you're a simple bitch and you don't have any friends, black or white, because nobody likes a fucking asshole.}
<A>__{she storms off leaving toni, for once, speechless.}
