<L>__{interior price and claire's room dawn}
<A>__{the first light of dawn strikes claire's bare torso. price's light meter appears at her back price takes a reading, then moves the meter to her neck, another reading. he moves it down her nude body lit beautifully in the vague light, partially covered with a blanket. he scurries across the room, stark naked, with a camera. price begins photographing her. he moves back to her and gently removes the blanket from the rest of her body. his actions are quiet and easy. he stops frequently to admire her. claire lies sleeping nude, except for her socks. price moves around the room picture, picture, picture. claire wakes up slowly and pulls the blanket back over her. she opens her eyes and sees price sitting in a chair several feet away with his camera.}

<A>__{her sense of violation is balanced by this notion. for a moment we sense her attitude can go either way outrage or some sense of being flattered, however ill conceived. she chooses the latter.}

<D>__{girl's names and f stops. terrible.}
<A>__{they curl up together, holding onto each other. a small child crosses the courtyard, peeking at them. a rooster crows.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{call the office. i don't want to go to work today.}
<A>__{the peacefulness is shaken by the roar of an engine close by. a helicopter gunship passes over the courtyard they look up, jolted out of the moment. the war is back.}
