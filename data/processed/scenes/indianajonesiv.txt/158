<L>__{interior coliseum}
<A>__{indiana walks across the coliseum floor. revolver in hand. he moves slowly. cautiously. he is looking for a sign of mephisto. but everything is silent. calm. deserted. mephisto sneaks along the top wall of the coliseum. hiding behind the row of surrounding bells. the nazi unlatches the chain that holds all of the bells in place. the bells begin to fall. thundering down the coliseum stairs. indy covers his ears. the sound of countless clanging bells is nearly deafening. he turns. seeing the enormous bells rolling toward him! indiana begins to run. giant rolling bells chase him from all directions! indy twists...turns...leaps...in an effort to avoid being crushed by the heavy bells. mephisto watches from above. smiling. indy continues to run. a giant rolling bell chases him from behind. the bell gains speed. getting closer. closer. a few feet in front of indy...is the deadly tiger pit. but indy can't stop running, or he'll be crushed by the bell. indiana leaps into the pit! the bell rolls directly over the pit. but indiana is safe. there is a five inch drop from the ground, to the pit's overhead metal bars. indy lies on the bars. safely above the countless tigers. the bells have all come to a stop. they lie around the coliseum ground. still. only one bell gently rocks. it slowly teeters on the coliseum stairs. it hasn't yet rolled off. indiana begins to climb out out of the pit, when suddenly... another gunshot rings out. indy is hit. in the chest. he slips. falls. bis wounded body is sprawled on the bars. teetering. ready to fall into the waiting tigers. mephisto's luger is smoking. the nazi walks down the coliseum stairs. he moves toward indiana. seeing mephisto heading for him... indiana removes his gun. he aims at the nazi. but indy's vision is blurred. his hand trembles. mephisto's silhouette nears... but the bullet zips past mephisto and strikes a section of wood below the teetering bell. this causes the bell to fall...and slowly roll forward. mephisto arrives at the edge of the tiger pit. he is about to shoot indy...then comes upon another idea. mephisto lowers the luger. he gives a swift kick to indy's ribs. indiana falls through the bars. his arm shoots out. with his last bit of strength, indy's hand grabs hold of a bar. clutching on for dear life. his body dangles over the tigers. they snap at his legs. hungry. growling. mephisto smiles. he steps on indy's fingers. grinding them beneath his boot heel. indy cries out... he's going to fall... mephisto pauses. he hears something behind him. a clanging bell. getting closer. louder. mephisto turns. he sees the giant bell. coming at him. only inches away. there is no time to move. the bell rolls over mephisto. knocking him into the pit. mephisto falls through the bars. inside the pit. into the middle of the hungry tigers. mephisto screams. the tigers are upon him. the nazi is ripped to shreds. within seconds, his screams are a memory. a very weak indiana still clutches the bar. he manages to boost himself out of the pit. he takes a few steps. wobbling. blood pours from the wound in his chest. he stumbles. to his knees. his eyes roll back. he falls to the ground. his body is still. motionless.}
