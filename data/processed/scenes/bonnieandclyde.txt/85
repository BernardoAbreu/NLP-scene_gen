<A>__{buck, crouching, shooting with one hand, gets the garage door open. a policeman fires. buck fires back and the cop falls dead in the street. buck, firing, dashes to the police car blocking their escape and releases the hand brake. clyde, bonnie and c.w. leap into their car, gun the motor, still shooting madly. two more police fall dead or wounded. one policeman is hurled through a fence by the blast of a sawed off shotgun. buck jumps into the car with the others. they now begin to bump the police car with their car. the police car picks up speed as they push it and it tears into the street right at the group of firing police. the gang's car turns into the street toward the running blanche. bonnie and clyde are in front; buck and c.w. in the back seat firing back at police. the car pulls alongside the wildly running blanche; the back door is flung open and in almost the style of a cartoon, two hands reach out and lift her off her feet and pull her into the car. they speed away.}
