<L>__{interior jackie's apartment night}
<A>__{max sits on the couch in jackie's apartment drinking white wine. jackie paces in front of him, white wine in one hand, davidoff in the other, going over the details of tomorrow. one could notice a slight change in jackie. there's a bit of an edge to miss brown that's bubbling underneath her cool surface. it's understandable. after all, she's been the architect of this half a million dollars switcheroo. she's moved heaven and earth to make all the pieces fall into place, and all the players thnk what she wants them to think. as she talks to max she knows tomorrow all her hard work will either fail or succeed. but don't take this difference the wrong way. this edge i'm referring to is not one born out of fear (jackie's nervous, but she's not afraid). it's more the edge an athlete might feel before an all important competition.}
