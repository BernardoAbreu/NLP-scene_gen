<A>__{diane looks at jim in silence. her face reveals nothing, but there is a deadness in her eyes. after a moment, she turns back inside, leaving the door open. jim follows his wife inside, closes the door. the camera moves to peek in the kitchen window, from where we watch jim and diane but cannot make out anything they say.}

<D>__{i don't know how diane and i made it through that night, but we did. our marriage had gone right to the brink, but in the end i guess it was saved by one simple fact: we truly loved each other. so we made a commitment to begin the painful process of piecing our lives back together. the worst was over; the mistakes of the past were behind us.}
