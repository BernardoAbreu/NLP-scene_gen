<A>__{rocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of dave, the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead horses. he pauses close to one horse's head. rocklin sees dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances around, and raise it to drink. the bottle is almost to dave's lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. the bottle is knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground. now rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds amusing despite its seriousness. old dave rants and snorts beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and exhibits his utter disgust generally.}

<A>__{he stops talking abruptly because his hand has, quite by chance, felt the spare bottle he carries, which he has forgotten in his anger. a most satisfying smile lights his bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view. he uncorks it, and stepping a few paces from the horse, raises the bottle.}
