<L>__{extremely high angle interior stairway and upstairs landing}
<A>__{we see arbogast coming up the stairs. and now we see, too, the door of the mother's room, opening, carefully and slowly. as arbogast reaches the landing, the door opens and the mother steps out, her hand raises high, the blade of an enormous knife flashing. c.u. a big head of an astonished arbogast the knife slashes across his cheek and neck. blood spurts. the sudden attack throws him off balance. he stumbles back and staggers down the whole of the staircase. he frantically gropes for the balustrade as he goes backwards down the stairs. the camera follows him all the way. a wicked knife keeps thrusting itself into the foreground. as he collapses at the bottom, the black head and shoulders of mrs. bates plunges into the foreground as the camera moves in to contain the raising and descending murder weapon.}
