<L>__{exterior mess day}
<A>__{chino steps outside and lights a cigarette. he puts an arm around lulu, starts to walk off...}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{today's the day, huh?}
<A>__{chino looks over, watches foley approach, lets his arm slip down so he can hook his thumb into lulu's belt... the next thing to having him on a leash.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{you excited?}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{i told you, man, super bowl sunday.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{yeah, but i see you moved it up.}
<C>__{chino}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why you think is today?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{you were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice. but you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five. saving yourself for the main event. then i see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. carbohydrates for endurance.}
<A>__{chino and lulu exchange looks.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{you want, i tole you you can come. you all right, foley. i like you.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{you told me i can come 'cause i caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.}
<A>__{foley smiles at lulu, who glares back at him.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{so what, you finish ahead of schedule?}
<A>__{chino looks towards the fence along the front of the yard.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{you see what they doing, those posts out there? putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there. we wait until super bowl sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days. so we going soon as it's dark. you want i mean it you can still come.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i appreciate the offer. and it's tempting.}
<A>__{foley looks off towards the visitors' parking area, the fence not twenty yards away.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{but, man, it's a long run to civilization. a hundred miles to miami? i'm too old to start acting crazy, try a stunt like that. you make it out, send me a postcard.}
