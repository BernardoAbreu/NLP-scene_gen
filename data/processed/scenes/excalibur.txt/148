<L>__{exterior river night}
<A>__{ragged and bruised, lifeless, he stares into space.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{i have lost my horse, my armor, my sword. i have lost my way. i have lost my strength. i have lost everything... i will not lose hope.}
<A>__{a light bursting through the trees shines on the mud, wordless, harmonies sound somewhere in the forest. perceval sets off toward the source. the burning light blasts into his face but he doesn't flinch. the chorus builds in power. before him, a drawbridge lowers.}
