<L>__{interior sarah's cell day}
<A>__{close on sarah. she is shackled, hands and feet, to the bed. sunlight falls across her pale face. a hand enter frame, gently stroking her cheek. she wakes up to see kyle reese. sitting on the edge of her bed, looking exactly the same as we last saw him in 1984. scruffy blonde hair and a long raincoat.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{kyle..? you're dead.}
<A>__{he gives her a gentle smile.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{i know. this is a dream, sarah.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{oh. yeah. they... make me take this stuff...}
<A>__{he puts a finger to her lips. then silently unfastens her restraints. they gaze into each other's eyes. and in the look that his death and the horror she has been through since hasn't touched their love at all.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{hold me.}
<A>__{she melts into reese's arms. pulls him to her.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{i love you. i always will.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{oh, god... kyle. i need you so much.}
<A>__{she kisses him passionately. they are locked together in a timeless moment. push in tight on sarah as she buries her face in his shoulder. she shuts her eyes tight. stay on sarah as reese speaks. he voice is strangely cold.}
<C>__{reese }
<D>__{where's john, sarah?}
<A>__{sarah opens her eyes and he is no longer in her arms. he is standing across the room. pinning her with an accusing gaze.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{they took him from me.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{it's john who's the target now. you have to protect him. he's wide open.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i know!}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{don't quit, sarah. our son need you.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(struggling not to cry)}
<D>__{i know, but i'm not as strong as i'm supposed to be. i can't do it. i'm screwing up the mission.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{remember the message... the future is not set. there is not fate but what we make for ourselves.}
<A>__{he turns toward the door.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{kyle, don't go!}
<C>__{reese}
<P>__{(turning back to her)}
<D>__{there's not much time left in the world, sarah.}
<A>__{reese goes out the door. sarah jumps from the bed, frantic. yanks the door open. follow her out.}
