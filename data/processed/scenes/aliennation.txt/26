<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{captain. i'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.}
<A>__{warner is surprised. he never expected sykes.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{... all right. detective sergeant sykes, this is detective... jetson.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{we have met.}
<A>__{warner looks up, clocking this. he looks at sykes, starting to smell something fishy. the balding man, goldrup, rises to shake their hands.}
<C>__{goldrup}
<D>__{victor goldrup, mayor's office. congratulations, gentlemen.}
<A>__{warner is starting to suspect what sykes is up to.}
<C>__{warner}
<P>__{(to sykes)}
<D>__{you are to have nothing to do with the investigation into bill tuggle's death. you know that. leave that for fedorchuk.}

<D>__{there's another case i'd like to take. a homicide a newcomer named hubley.}
<A>__{jetson looks over at sykes, knows he's up to something. sykes avoids his look.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{granger and pitts are already on it.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{granger and pitts have one hell of a caseload... and i would have thought with jetson here being the first newcomer plainclothes, and hubley's body being found over in the newcomer community...}

<D>__{don't tell me what to think.}
<C>__{goldrup}
<D>__{he's got a pointerior that's the sort of thing we should be doing with this early advancement program...}
