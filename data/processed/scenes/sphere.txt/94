<C>__{norman}
<D>__{getting anywhere with those?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{there's some sort of pattern here. it'll take a minute.}

<D>__{did i?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you don't remember that?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i don't remember much. it's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue but i can't taste any of it. funny, my senses are much keener though. purer. hearing, seeing, smelling. like, i can smell your sheets, norman. you tried to wash it out earlier, but i can still smell the urine.}

<D>__{don't worry, i'm not going to tell the others. it's normal, really, isn't it? in a crisis. the stress. the panic.}
