<A>__{as martin with slightly averted face crosses to take the bridle of ethan's horse and lead him away.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(wheeling on him)}
<D>__{momento!}
<A>__{martin checks his stride, stares in surprise.}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(contritely)}
<D>__{martin!... here we've been standing... ethan, you haven't forgotten martin?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{oh... mistook you for a half breed.}
<C>__{martin}

<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i will take this...}
<A>__{he completes unlacing the pack and takes it treating it as though it contained something of value. martin watches with a touch of resentment: ethan doesn't trust him. ethan turns and sees the look. he doesn't care what martin thinks, nor does he explain. martin leads the horse off.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{supper'll be ready by the time you wash up... let me take your coat for you, ethan.}
<A>__{he hesitates, then grudgingly surrenders it conscious of its sorry condition.}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(smiling faintly)}
<D>__{and... welcome home.}
<A>__{he just nods, then turns to follow aaron around the side of the house toward the wash up.}
