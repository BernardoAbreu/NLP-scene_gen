<A>__{she takes the car curbside and parks.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{now go ahead.}
<A>__{simon looks back at melvin as does carol. he looks innocent. several beats melvin almost says something a hidden hand gesture from carol stops him. finally.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{well, i always painted. always. and my mother always encouraged it. she was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... i was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. she used to pose nude for me... and i thought or assumed my father was aware of it.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{this stuff is pointless.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{hey you let him...}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{you like sad stories you want mine.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{. go ahead, simon. really. please. don't let him stop you. ignore him.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{okay. well, one day my father came in on one of those painting sessions when i was nine and he just started screaming at her at us at evil. and...}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(very quickly)}
<D>__{... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years he hit my hand with a yardstick if i made a mistake on the piano.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{go ahead, simon. your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i was trying to defend my mother and make peace, in the lamest way. i said, "she's not naked it's art." and then he started hitting me. and he beat me unconscious. after that he talked to me less and less he knew before i left for college, my dad came into my room. he held out his hand. it was filled with money. a big wad of sweaty money.}
<P>__{(gathers himself)}
<D>__{and he said to me, "i don't want you to ever come back." i grabbed him and i hugged him... he turns and walked out.}
<A>__{carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as strange as she does moved by simon's trauma which is so much more complicated than her meat and potatoes troubles. she looks out her window then kisses her fingers and touches them to simon's cheek. a nice, understated, gesture of friendship.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{well, you know i still stay what i said. you've got to get past it all when it comes to your parents. we all have these horror stories to get over.}
<A>__{melvin shifts into the frame.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{that's not true. some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. just not anybody in this car. but lots of people that's their story good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{not it at all, really.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(a veteran's irony)}
<D>__{not at all, huh?!... let's go to the hotel. and if you're lucky tomorrow dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.}
