<A>__{as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size and reaches for the man in black who drops to his knees, spins loose, and slips between the giant's legs.}

<D>__{you're quick.}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{and a good thing too.}
<C>__{fezzik}
<P>__{(getting set for another onslaught)}
<D>__{why do you wear a mask? were you burned by acid, or something like that?}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{oh no. it's just that they're terribly comfortable. i think everyone will be wearing them in the future.}
<A>__{fezzik considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the man in black slips down to avoid the charge, fezzik moves right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the man in black jumps for fezzik's back and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have fezzik's throat, locked across fezzik's windpipe, one in front, one behind. the man in black begins to squeeze. tighter.}
