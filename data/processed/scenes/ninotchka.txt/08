<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{spread out on a table in the royal suite. camera pulls back to a longer shot. we see mercier, the jeweler, examining the jewels with an eyepiece screwed in his eye. around him stand the three russians. mercier, a middle aged man of the greatest suavity and elegance, but a shrewd trader none the less, looks up.}
<C>__{mercier}
<D>__{very good... superb... excellent... it would be foolish to belittle the quality of the merchandise but your terms are impossible. my counteroffer is the absolute maximum.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{but, monsieur mercier...}
<C>__{mercier}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{gentlemen, i will let you in on a little secret... we are only undertaking this deal for the prestige involved, and, quite frankly, we are expecting to take a loss.}
<A>__{iranoff draws buljanoff aside and whispers in his ear.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{capitalistic methods...}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{they accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.}
<A>__{the telephone rings.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(answering phone)}
<D>__{hello... this is buljanoff, iranoff, and kopalski... who?... count d'algout?... no, no... it must be a mistake... we can't be disturbed.}
<C>__{mercier}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i assure you no one else could meet the figure named by my syndicate... at least under the present economic conditions.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{we can wait.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<P>__{(pompously)}
<D>__{do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?}
<C>__{mercier}
<D>__{yes. gentlemen... let's put our cards face down. right now there is a russian commission in new york trying to sell fifteen rembrandts. there is another in london mortgaging the oil fields in baku. you need money and you need it quickly. i think my offer is fair and does not even take advantage of your situation.}
<A>__{close up buljanoff, iranoff, and kopalski}
<C>__{kopalski}
<P>__{(to mercier)}
<D>__{just a minute.}
<A>__{the three russians step to one side.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<P>__{(in a low voice)}
<D>__{he's cutting our throat...}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{but what can we do?... we have to accept.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{comrades! comrades! don't let's give in so quickly. after all we have to uphold the prestige of russia.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{all right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.}
<B>__{shot of the whole group}
<A>__{there is a knock at the door. iranoff walks toward it, unlocks it, opens it a little. in the door appears leon.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{we don't want to be disturbed.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{my name is count d'algout. i telephoned.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{if you want to see us you must come later.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i just want a word with monsieur mercier.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{but you can't...}
<A>__{leon pushes his way in. he approaches monsieur mercier. the russians get between him and the jewels and during the following scene put them back into the safe.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{monsieur mercier. may i introduce myself? i am count leon d'algout. i think i had the pleasure of meeting you in your beautiful shop. i was admiring a platinum watch with diamond numbers.}
<C>__{mercier}
<D>__{oh, yes, yes...}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(glancing at the jewels)}
<D>__{glorious, aren't they?}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{now, monsieur, you have no right...}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(very charmingly)}
<D>__{just a moment.}
<P>__{(to mercier)}
<D>__{i hope you haven't closed this deal, monsieur mercier. it might bring you into serious difficulties.}
<C>__{all three russians}
<D>__{who are you? what do you want? what is this?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{these jewels are the property of the duchess swana of russia, and were seized illegally by the soviet government. i am acting for her highness, the duchess. here is my power of attorney.}
<A>__{he hands it to mercier, who reads it.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{you know, monsieur mercier, this is all non sense.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{these may have been the jewels of the duchess swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the state.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{we'll leave the problem of their ownership to the french courts. meanwhile i have filed a petition for an injunction to prohibit you from either selling or removing the jewels. here is a copy.}
<A>__{the russians take the copy of the injunction, read it flabbergasted. as they do so, leon turns to monsieur mercier.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i thought it my duty to warn you. i would hate to see you get in any trouble, monsieur.}
<C>__{mercier}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(he turns to the russians)}
<D>__{gentlemen, this introduces a new element into our negotiations. until this claim is completely settled...}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{we can call our ambassador.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{i give you my word! they were confiscated legally!}
<C>__{mercier}
<D>__{please try to understand my position. i am not with drawing. my offer stands and as soon as you produce a clear title, approved by the french courts, the deal is settled. until then, good day.}
<A>__{he bows and starts toward the door. leon accompanies him, opening the door as though he were the host.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(intimately)}
<D>__{i hope you will forgive me, monsieur mercier.}
<C>__{mercier}
<P>__{(in a low voice)}
<D>__{on the contrary. i consider myself very lucky. good day.}
<A>__{he bows.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(bowing)}
<D>__{good day, monsieur.}
<A>__{mercier leaves. leon closes the door and turns back into the room to the three outraged russians.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(jauntily)}
<D>__{well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{get out of here!}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. all is not lost. you may have a chance.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<P>__{(bursting forth)}
<D>__{we may have a chance.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{yes... a very slim one. i want to be fair. i don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{we haven't anything to discuss with you. we'll talk to a lawyer!}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{all right go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and i will talk to the judge!}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{that won't help you! you can't intimidate us!}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{soviet russia will put all its might behind this case.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{you think because you represent the former duchess...}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{the duchess...}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{the former duchess!}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{in any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. i warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a french court, and when the duchess takes the stand...}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{all right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! what can she say?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{but how will she look? the fashions this spring are very becoming to her. gentlemen, the judge will be french, the jury will be french, everybody in that courtroom will be french. have you ever seen a french court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? you sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{i suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{oh, no, no. i am not a highwayman, i'm just a nuisance. all i'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{what proposition?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i just said let's have a little lunch.}
<P>__{(picking up the telephone)}
<D>__{room service.}
