<L>__{interior liquor store continuous}
<A>__{at first it all seems overwhelming. fogell is confused, dizzy, and sweating. he steps behind a large beer display and takes a few deep breaths.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{hi there.}
<A>__{fogell flinches, shocked someone spoke to him. he keeps walking. he nears a mother and her 17 year old son. as fogell passes them, the son seems to recognize him. fogell clearly recognizes the son. their eyes meet. fogell looks in the opposite direction.}
<C>__{son}
<D>__{fogell?}
<C>__{fogell}
<P>__{(weird voice, covering his face)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{son}
<D>__{yo, fogell. `sup man. what're you doing here?}
<C>__{fogell}
<P>__{(weird voice)}
<D>__{uh...nothing. not fogell...}
<P>__{(whisper)}
<D>__{shut up, moscovitch. you don't know me.}
<C>__{moscovitch}
<P>__{(knowingly)}
<D>__{oh, oh. cool, cool. good luck.}
<A>__{he puts his head down and quickly walks away. he arrives at the beer and cooler section. clearly intimidated, he slowly opens a beer fridge. he grabs one beer attached to a six pack and pulls it forward. the beer comes loose in his hand as the other five fall to the ground, cracking on impact, and spraying beer all over the place. fogell scrambles to stop the beers from spraying, but soon finds that it is impossible.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{fuck.}
<A>__{a clerk approaches fogell.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{is there a problem, sir?}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{umm, nope, no problem whatsoever.}
<C>__{clerk}
<P>__{(pointing to the beer on the floor)}
<D>__{sir, did you do this? on the floor?}
<C>__{fogell}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think it happened before.}
<A>__{fogell is standing in a puddle of beer with beer sprayed all over his legs, holding a can of beer.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{i think i would know, thank you.}
<A>__{fogell walks away.}
