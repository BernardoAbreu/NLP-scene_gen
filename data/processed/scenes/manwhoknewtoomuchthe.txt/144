<L>__{interior inspector's office (day) medium shot}
<A>__{as ben enters the office, both jo and the inspector look up him inquiringly.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{who was it, ben?}
<A>__{ben adopts as casual an air as he can under the circumstances. he doesn't sit down. he speaks more to the inspector than to his wife, avoiding her eyes.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it was the concierge at the hotel. he heard we were being held by the police and thought there was some way he could help us.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{that was nice of him.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(looking at inspector)}
<D>__{i told him if we weren't back there in fifteen minutes to call the american consulate in casablanca.}
<A>__{the inspector has realised that he won't get any more out of ben.}
<C>__{inspector}
<P>__{(charmingly)}
<D>__{but, monsieur, if you had only told me in the first place, that you wished to consult with your consul!}
<A>__{ben gives him a look.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{let's go, jo.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{there is just one small formality. i must request you to sign a statement of the facts.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{if it doesn't take too long.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{but a moment. i will send for a typist.}
<A>__{reluctantly the inspector reaches for a phone on his desk. jo looks at her husband somewhat puzzled.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{ben...}
<A>__{he gives her a warning glance to be quiet. she does. he reaches out, takes her hand.}
