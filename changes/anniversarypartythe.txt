<ACTION>__{TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY THERRIAN She's in her mid-thirties, with large deep eyes.  She watches her husband unguarded in sleep.  Her pretty face, alert, she's barely breathing.  Traces the just visible lines around his eyes, and mouth.  Brushes fingertips against his eyelashes. TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY'S HAND PULLS THE BEDROOM SHADE. It retracts with a loud WHACK, sun, sky, trees.}

<ACTION>__{We're in the middle of a yoga lesson.  Joe and Sally stand on their mats.  Steven, their instructor, wanders around the couple issuing soft-spoken instructions. A large room with hard wood floors, dominated by a huge fireplace.  The dining room on one side, living room on the other.  Floor to ceiling windows overlook the back porch garden pool... The house is classic Neutra.  All GLASS and}

<ACTION>__{The CAMERA glances off photos of the couple: portraits and candids, their wedding day, with friends, on vacation, tumbling on the lawn, and the like. Some framed and hung, some taped to the fridge or simply leaning on a shelf.  It's clear that at least a handful are by the same photographer, black and whites, grainy and beautiful. There are lots of photos of Joe and his sister Lucy, documenting their relationship from childhood.  There's an ANNIE LEIBOWITZ photo-shoot of Sally carelessly displayed somewhere.}

<DIAL>__{You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.}
<ACTION>__{Sally's started the bath, and is watching him from the doorway.  He meets her eyes mid-sentence.}
<CHAR>__{JOE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Oh?  I don't think tonight.  I'm sure they're well behaved.  All our friends have dogs, and they always want to bring them.  We'd be outnumbered, you see?  So we sort of put a ban on it.  Sorry.}
<ACTION>__{He rolls his eyes.  Sally walks back into the bathroom, she isn't buying it.}
