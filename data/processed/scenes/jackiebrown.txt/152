<L>__{interior ray nicolet's apartment night}
<A>__{a stedicam glides through the apartment, it falls on a beeper "beeping", a gun, a wallet and car keys on a dresser drawer... it leaves that and lands on a tv screen: tom snyder is interviewing a guest on his show ... it leaves that and falls on two empty and one quarter filled beer bottles... it leaves that and falls on a sleeping ray nicolet passed out in his reclining chair. the sound of tom snyder and the faint beeping are heard offscreen.}
