<L>__{interior willy's office a week later}
<A>__{controlled chaos. a week's work has emptied the shelves and cleared the surfaces, but the file cabinet drawers are all half open: willy sorts folders, neatly marking and packing them. white "trans file" storage boxes are piled all over.}
<C>__{messenger }
<D>__{slocum?}
<A>__{willy looks up, at a messenger with another file box.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{messenger}
<D>__{where do you want it?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{the idea here is we're trying to take boxes out not bring more in.}
<C>__{messenger}
<D>__{is that the idea?}
<A>__{willy sourly gestures to a chair; checks the label as the messenger sets it down }
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{whoa wait a second, this is a screw up. i already have these documents. i sent this box: to the defendant, at county.}
<C>__{messenger}
<D>__{i picked up at county. slip says bring 'em here.}
<A>__{messenger holds out a clipboard. willy reluctantly signs. as the messenger leaves, willy cuts the tape and takes out a folder. opens it: crawford has scrawled no in red marker across the top sheet. willy turns to the next page. a big red no across that, too. pulls out more documents flips through: no no no no red letters wriggling across the typed pages, like flip book animation. beat. disturbed, he picks up the phone, dials.}
