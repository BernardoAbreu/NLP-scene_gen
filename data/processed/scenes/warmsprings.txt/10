<L>__{interior sitting room continuous}
<A>__{eleanor roosevelt, 34, is dictating a letter. her enormous eyes, liquid and blue, reveal a woman of extraordinary intelligence and depth.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{unfortunately, i would be of little assistance to the junior assistance league. particularly if my purpose were to appear as an alumna who is gifted at public speaking.}
<A>__{she is dictating to lucy mercer, 27, deeply feminine with a head of soft dark hair and an accommodating nature. she is eleanor's social secretary and closest friend. she is also the woman dancing with franklin the night before.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{and what do you really want me to say?}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{thank you and if you ask again i shall scream?}
<A>__{they share a laugh which is not shared by the homely rumpled mess of a man draped over a sofa in the corner.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{why don't you ask your husband for some pointers? he's a pretty gifted public speaker, don't you think?}
<A>__{louis howe, 48, is a wizened man of limited stature and unlimited soul. franklin's political advisor extraordinaire part consiglieri and part priest. he is the mastermind behind what he believes will be the greatest political career of the twentieth century. he gets up and leans in closely to eleanor. a cigarette dangles off his lip and the smoke rises up and curls in her face.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you should get out once in a while. accepting that invitation would be good for franklin's career.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{mr. howe, wouldn't you be more comfortable waiting for my husband outside?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{in the street, mrs. roosevelt?}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{if you like.}
<A>__{eleanor smiles oh so politely at louis, as franklin enters from the dining room.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i see it's not even eight a.m. and already the gloves are off.}
<P>__{(kissing eleanor on the cheek)}
<D>__{good morning, babs. hello, miss mercer.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{good morning, sir.}
<A>__{quickly, she lowers her eyes to her work.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{you're late. honestly, why do you enjoy keeping people waiting?}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{because they always seem more grateful to see me when i arrive.}
<A>__{he leans in and kisses eleanor on the cheek.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{have a lovely day, babs.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{should i expect you for dinner?}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i have the navy reception this evening. i will be home quite late. unless you've changed your mind about coming?}
<A>__{louis looks up from his paper at lucy who is writing furiously.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{do you wish me to come?}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{well... whatever you'd like.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{thank you, no.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{very well then.}
<P>__{(tipping his hat)}
<D>__{good day, miss mercer.}
<A>__{lucy nods and franklin exits. then louis tips his hat to the ladies and follows him out.}
