<L>__{exterior loading dock day}
<A>__{nick rockets off the loading dock, through the air and down, hitting the concrete driveway. the driveway peels off to the left and slopes downward. nick hangs tight, hugs the curve, and picks up more speed. below, the driveway splits off. to the left, slip stream's main building, and to the right, the parking lot.}
<B>__{guards}
<A>__{are piled into an electric cart, speeding up from the left to cut nick off. it's going to be close... nick forks off to the right dust before they reach him. it's clear sailing now, and up ahead, nick can see alex pulling up to the end of the driveway... whoosh! nick scrapes the board forward, grinding the wheels sideways in order to slow his speed... he leaps. picking the board up with him. and dunks himself smack dab in the back seat of the skylark.}
