<A>__{dickie and ripley travel up to san remo. they sit next to each other. dickie's asleep. ripley lays his head on dickie's shoulder , but as he does that, the ticket inspector announces the san remo stop, taps on the window and dickie stirs. then ripley plays his familiar game of studying his face in the reflection of the train window, so that he can move his head and see his reflection, then back and see dickie's. dickie suddenly catches him staring. ripley looks away.}
