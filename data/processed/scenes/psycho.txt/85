<A>__{standing on the porch of the motel, leaning against a post. he is staring out into the night, a look of guarded, casual innocence on his face, as if he were taking one last moment of peaceful night air before retiring. then he glances down and camera follows his gaze. a hose is lying on the ground outside mary's cabin, its stream of water obliterating the tire marks. after a moment, norman's hand comes into shot, picks up hose, places it in a new position. as camera pulls back, we see that the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the road markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a car had been parked here. after a short wait, norman goes to the hose faucet, turns it off, unscrews the hose. as he rolls the hose, he walks away from the spot, past the office, heading for the path that leads to the house. he goes up the path, pauses at the steps of the house, tosses the curled hose onto the lawn, goes up the steps and into the house. camera follows him in, pauses as he pauses at the foot of the stairs. norman goes up the stairs. on the landing he stops. the door to his mother's room is closed. lying in a heap outside the door are a blood stained dress and a pair of elderly woman's shoes. from an extremely high angle, we look down on norman as he bends to pick up the stained dress and shoes. he rolls the shoes into the dress, tucks the small, neat bundle under his arm, and starts down the stairs, heading for the basement.}
