<L>__{exterior a residential street, washington long shot night}
<A>__{a taxi drives up and stops in front of a handsome residence. it is the burton home. guy gets out of the taxi and goes up the steps. med. shot over guy's shoulder his figure tense, he rings the bell. after a moment's wait, the door is opened from inside and anne burton stands in the lighted hallway. she looks at guy with an anxious, taut expression, searches his face hastily, then as he takes a step inside she is suddenly in his arms. they embrace with wordless fervor.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(holding her close)}
<D>__{anne darling, you're trembling.}
<A>__{anne draws back and looks into his face as if searching for an answer to some question in her mind.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{guy }
<P>__{(her fingers gently touch his face)}
<D>__{i wonder if you know how much i love you.}
<A>__{guy takes her hand from his face, caresses it with his lips.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(forcing a smile)}
<D>__{brazen woman. i'm the one to say that.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(tensely)}
<D>__{but i wanted you to know, before...}
<P>__{(forcing herself to be calm)}
<D>__{before we go into the living room.}
<A>__{father wants to see you.}
<B>__{closeup guy}
<A>__{he looks apprehensively in direction of the living room, conscious of what the news is to be, but covering up. long shot living room from guy's viewpoint senator burton and barbara burton are seated near a desk on the farthest side of the room. senator burton is a distinguished fifty, a man with great pride in tradition, his family and his career. barbara, anne's younger sister, is a lively seventeen who loves excitement, says exactly what she thinks and rarely thinks before she says it. superficially, in height and figure, she resembles miriam. she also weirs glasses. by her gestures we gather she is speaking urgently, but softly, to her father, who lifts a weary hand to quiet her as she looks toward guy in the hallway, barbara keeps quiet and also looks toward guy. they both wait for him to enter.}
<B>__{closeup guy}
<A>__{he steels himself for the long walk across the hall and the living room.}
<B>__{closeup anne}
<A>__{watching guy closely.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{as guy starts to make the long trek across the living room, with anne behind him }
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(stiffly)}
<D>__{good evening, sir. hello, babs.}
<A>__{barbara has been squirming in her seat, then as if jet propelled she catapults out of it and runs to guy, giving him a big hug and a smack on the cheek.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{something awful has happened, guy.}
<C>__{senator}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{sit down, barbara.}
<A>__{subdued, she sits down. but guy remains standing.}
<C>__{senator}
<P>__{(finding it difficult to begin)}
<D>__{there seems to be no way of diplomatically breaking tragic news. i'm sorry, guy, to be the one to tell you. it concerns your wife. she's been murdered.}
<A>__{guy stares woodenly at the senator, is if hypnotized.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{the police have been using everything but radar to locate you.}
<C>__{senator}
<D>__{you're to call headquarters at metcalf.}
<A>__{the full impact of what has happened hits guy once more.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{miriam...murdered.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(with inner tension)}
<D>__{she was...strangled.}
<A>__{slowly guy's eyes meet hers. they are remembering what he said on the phone: "i could strangle her." he sinks into a chair. the senator is quite distressed. during the following scene barbara quietly goes about the business of pouring drinks and serving them. she knows everyone's preference.}
<C>__{senator}
<P>__{(wrylt, to guy)}
<D>__{it happened on an island in an amusement park. it was sort of a lovers lane, i believe. a rather sordid atmosphere.}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(quickly, to guy)}
<D>__{miriam went there with two boys. they were the ones who found her. so they're not suspects. but you probably will be.}
<C>__{senator}
<D>__{young lady, we can't overlook the fact that murder is at our doorsteps. but i forbid you to drag it into the living room!}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(wide eyed)}
<D>__{let's not fool ourselves. the police will say guy wanted miriam out of the way so he could marry anne. in a crime of this sort the police first go after the husband, and guy had every motive.}
<C>__{senator}
<P>__{(aghast)}
<D>__{motive?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{she's right. whichever way you look at it...i'm in a spot.}
<C>__{senator}
<P>__{(disconcerted but whistling in dark)}
<D>__{oh come now, my boy. i'm sure you have nothing to worry about.}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{if he hasn't an alibi for nine thirty tonight he has plenty to worry about.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(who hasn't taken anxious eyes off guy)}
<D>__{you can tell them where you were, can't you, guy?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{at nine thirty i was on the train from new york to washington.}
<C>__{senator}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{there you are.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{who saw you? did you speak to anyone? you'll need a witness, you know.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(as if it didn't matter)}
<D>__{yes, i spoke to someone.}
<C>__{senator}
<P>__{(hopefully)}
<D>__{anyone you know?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{no. his name was collins. he is a professor.}
<C>__{senator}
<P>__{(brightening)}
<D>__{harvard.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{university of virginia.}
<A>__{the senator's expression says: "well, that's not too bad."}
<B>__{closeup anne}
<A>__{her face shows her relief that guy can account for his time.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{then everything's's all right.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{not quite. detectives play a game called motive, motive, who'd got the motive.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(near the breaking point)}
<D>__{i'm sick of hearing that word!}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{he'll still have to answer questions.}
<C>__{senator}
<D>__{routine. pure routine.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i'm afraid there'll be a lot of reporters at your front door in the morning.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{daddy doesn't mind a little scandal. he's a senator.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(answering guy's look)}
<D>__{it can't be helped, darling. it is not your fault. it's not as though anyone can say you had something to do with it.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{someone might say it...i'd do anything to keep you all out of this mess.}
<C>__{senator}
<D>__{profit by my experience, guy. never lose any sleep over accusations.}
<P>__{(an afterthought)}
<D>__{unless they can be proved, of course. we'll help all we can. dreadful business, dreadful. that poor unfortunate girl.}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{she was a tramp.}
<C>__{senator}
<P>__{(pontificially)}
<D>__{she was a human being. let me remind you that even the most unworthy of us has the right to life and the pursuit of happiness.}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(unimpressed)}
<D>__{from what i hear, she pursued it in all directions.}
<C>__{senator}
<D>__{barbara!}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{father, it's getting terribly late, and guy looks so tired...}
<C>__{senator}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{of course, of course. back to bed, barbara.}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(ignoring this to anne and guy)}
<D>__{well, you two. nothing stands in your way now. you can be married right away. think of it you're free!}
<B>__{close two anne and guy}
<A>__{look at one another with a growing realization of what miriam's death actually means to their happiness they are free.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{the senator firmly urges barbara to the door.}
<C>__{senator}
<P>__{(to barbara)}
<D>__{one doesn't always have to say what one thinks!}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(sweetly)}
<D>__{father, i'm not a politician.}
<A>__{the senator gives her a gentle but firm push out of sight.}
<C>__{senator}
<D>__{you won't forget that call, guy? captain turley.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{yes sir. goodnight.}
<A>__{barbara pokes her head quickly around the door.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i still think it would be wonderful to have a man love you so much he'd kill for you.}
<P>__{(she ducks out)}
<B>__{two shot}
<A>__{left alone, guy and anne embrace. anne's nervous tension comes to the surface in a flood of relief.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i told myself over and over i was being silly, but there was one horrible moment tonight when the news came through. i kept remembering what you shouted telephone from metcalf.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{that i could strang...}
<A>__{anne quickly puts her fingers over his mouth.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{don't even say it. forget you ever said it. even more terrifying than the murder itself, guy, was the awful thought that if you had anything to do with it we'd be separated, perhaps forever. i'd never see you again. i couldn't bear it.}
