<A>__{nathan and gabrielle are in bed. nathan stares up at the ceiling. finally:}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i want our boy back.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{oui.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{that bitch. i worked so hard. we worked so hard, you and i. he would've made us famous.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{we still have you and i.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i know. and that's great. but it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if i could find him and bring him back.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{where do we look for little lost puff?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i have some thoughts. i think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{that is horrible. apes are dirty. no?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{you better believe they're dirty! and smelly! and messy! and they don't know their forks from their assholes!}
<A>__{nathan, seemingly in the grips of a sudden horrific migraine, scrunches his face and holds his ears. he relaxes a bit, and gets out of bed. he walks across the room, pulls on some pants, and picks up a container called "stop buggin' me, sunny."}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i'm going alone. this could be dangerous.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<P>__{(pulling covers up}
<D>__{and turning away from him onto her}
<P>__{side)}
<D>__{okay, my sweet. good night.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{a little resistance would be nice, damn it.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<P>__{(without opening her eyes)}
<D>__{please let me go with you.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{okay.}
