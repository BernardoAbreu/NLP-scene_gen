<L>__{exterior wheeler house day.}
<A>__{april drags two overflowing garbage cans to the curb. she stops and looks down the empty road. not a single human being in sight. close on april's face.}
<L>__{interior mrs. givings' car day, 1948. flashback.}
<A>__{mrs. givings sits behind the wheel, driving slowly along a suburban street talking at high speed. frank sits beside her wearing sunglasses. april sits in the back. we don't yet see what mrs. givings is describing, only as it plays on their faces.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{of course, i knew the moment you came off the train what you were looking for... a small remodeled barn, or a carriage house and i just hate to be the one to tell you that sort of thing just isn't available anymore... but i don't want you to despair. there is one place down here i want to show you... now of course it isn't very desirable at this end.}
<P>__{(gestures)}
<D>__{as you see, crawford road is mostly these little cinder blocky, pick up trucky places plumbers, carpenters, little local people of that sort.}
<A>__{frank turns around to april, lowers his glasses. april stifles a giggle.}
<C>__{mrs. givings }
<D>__{but eventually...}
<P>__{(she points, her arm fully extended)}
<D>__{eventually it leads up to revolutionary road, which is much nicer. now, the place i want to show you, is a sweet little house and a sweet little setting. simple, clean lines, good lawns, marvelous for children. it's right around this next curve... now, you'll see it there.}
<A>__{they all look.}
<C>__{mrs. givings }
<D>__{see the little white one? sweet isn't it? the perky way it sits there on its little slope? charming, isn't it?}
<A>__{april smiles. a smile full of promise.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{oh, yes.}
