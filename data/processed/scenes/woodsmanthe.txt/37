<L>__{interior walter's apartment morning}
<A>__{walter stands by the window watching vicki walk towards her jeep. something brushes his leg. he looks down to see the red ball resting by his foot. he turns to see... a glimpse of a young girl as she flashes by the door. she is twelve years old and wears a white nightgown. there is the sound of a car honk, and walter looks out the window to see vicki pull away. he looks back toward the girl. there is nothing there.}
