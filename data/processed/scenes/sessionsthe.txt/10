<D>__{the apostle luke tells us that when elizabeth spoke to mary, the baby in her womb leapt "for lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy". so mary's fear and apprehension slowly gave way to pride and purpose. elizabeth saw the greatness in mary. "blessed art thou among women". elizabeth, pregnant herself with st. john, felt the power of this wondrous woman. it was elizabeth, and her absolute faith, that gave mary the courage she was lacking, and she gave thanks saying: "my soul doth magnify the lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour". may the spirit of the lord be amongst you and remain with you always.}
