<A>__{we see the door frame of the elevator and the floor buttons beside it and, looking down the corridor through the open elevator doors, pinhead and the female cenobite marching towards us. we also see kirsty's finger jabbing frantically at the floor buttons. the doors are not closing. the cenobites are getting very close. finally, just as pinhead breaks from his determined but medium paced stride and speeds up eagerly for the last two or three yards, extending his arm as he does so, the door slams shut across our vision and we hear the elevator machinery start up.}
