<A>__{b 2 a board of chinese checkers camera withdraws and gradually reveals the dietrichson living room night the checker board is on the davenport between phyllis and lola. mr. dietrichson sits in a big easy chair. his coat and tie are over the back of the chair, and the evening paper is lying tumbled on the floor beside him. he is smoking a cigar with the band on it. he has a drink in front of him and several more inside him. in another chair sits neff, his briefcase on the floor, leaning against his chair. he holds his rate book partly open, with a finger in it for a marker. he is going full swing.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i suppose you realize, mr. dietrichson, that, not being an employee, you are not covered by the state compensation insurance act. the only way you can protect yourself is by having a personal policy of your own.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{i know all about that. the next thing you'll tell me i need earthquake insurance and lightning insurance and hail insurance.}
<A>__{phyllis looks up from the checker board and cuts in on the dialogue. lola listens without much interest.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(to dietrichson)}
<D>__{if we bought all the insurance they can think up, we'd stay broke paying for it, wouldn't we, honey?}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{what keeps us broke is you going out and buying five hats at a crack. who needs a hat in california?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i always say insurance is a lot like a hot water bottle. it looks kind of useless and silly hanging on the hook, but when you get that stomach ache in the middle of the night, it comes in mighty handy.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{now you want to sell me a hot water bottle.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{dollar for dollar, accident insurance is the cheapest coverage you can buy, mr. dietrichson.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{maybe some other time, mr. neff. i had a tough day.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{just as you say, mr. dietrichson.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{suppose we just settle that automobile insurance tonight.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{sure. all we need on that is for you to sign an application for renewal.}
<A>__{phyllis throws a quick glance at neff. as she looks back she sees that lola is staring down at her wrist watch.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{phyllis, do you mind if we don't finish this game? it bores me stiff.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{got some thing better to do?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{yes, i have.}
<A>__{she gets up.}
<C>__{lola}
<P>__{(to dietrichson)}
<D>__{father, is it all right if i run along now?}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{run along where? who with?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{just anne. we're going roller skating.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{anne who?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{anne matthews.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{it's not that nino zachetti again?}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{it better not be that zachetti guy. if i ever catch you with that }
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{it's anne matthews, i told you. i also told you we're going roller skating. i'm meeting her at the corner of vermont and franklin the north west corner, in case you're interested. and i'm late already. i hope that is all clear. good night, father. good night, phyllis.}
<A>__{she starts to go.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{good night, miss dietrichson.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. good night, mr. }
<C>__{neff}

<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{now you're not going to take my car again.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{no thanks. i'd rather be dead.}
<A>__{she goes out through the archway.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{a great little fighter for her weight.}
<A>__{dietrichson sucks down a big swallow of his drink. neff has taken two blank forms from his briefcase. he puts the briefcase on mr. dietrichson's lap and lays the forms on top. phyllis is watching closely.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{this is where you sign, mr. dietrichson.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{sign what?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{the applications for your auto renewals. so you'll be protected until the new policies are issued.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{when will that be?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{in about a week.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{just so i'm covered when i drive up north.}
<A>__{neff takes out his fountain pen.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{san francisco, mr. dietrichson?}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{palo alto.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{he was a stanford man, mr. neff. and he still goes to his class reunion every year.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{what's wrong with that? can't i have a little fun even once a year?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{great football school, stanford. did you play football, mr. dietrichson?}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{left guard. almost made the varsity, too.}
<A>__{neff has unscrewed his fountain pen. he hands it to mr. dietrichson. dietrichson puts on his glasses.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{on that bottom line, mr. dietrichson.}
<A>__{dietrichson signs. neff's and phyllis' eyes meet for a split second.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{both copies, please.}
<A>__{he withdraws the top copy barely enough to expose the signature line on the supposed duplicate.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{sign twice, huh?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{one is the agent's copy. i need it for my files.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<P>__{(in a mutter)}
<D>__{files. duplicates. triplicates.}
<A>__{dietrichson grunts and signs again. again neff and phyllis exchange a quick glance.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{no hurry about the check, mr. dietrichson. i can pick it up at your office some morning.}
<A>__{casually neff lifts the briefcase and signed applications off dietrichson's lap.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{how much you taking me for?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{one forty seven fifty, mr. dietrichson.}
<A>__{dietrichson stands up. he is about neff's height but a little heavier.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i guess that's enough insurance for one evening, mr. neff.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{plenty.}
<A>__{dietrichson has poured some more whisky into his glass. he tries the siphon but it is empty. he gathers up his coat and tie and picks up his glass.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{good night, mr. neff.}
<A>__{neff is zipping up his briefcase.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{good night, mr. dietrichson. good night, mrs. dietrichson.}
<C>__{dietrichson}
<D>__{bring me some soda when you come up, phyllis.}
<A>__{dietrichson trundles off towards the archway.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(to neff)}
<D>__{i think you left your hat in the hall.}
<A>__{phyllis leads the way and neff goes after her, his briefcase under his arm. b 3 hallway dietrichson residence (night) phyllis enters through the living room archway with neff behind her. she leads him towards the door. on the way he picks up his hat. in the background dietrichson begins to ascend the stairs, carrying his coat and glass. phyllis and neff move close to the door. they speak in very low voices.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{all right, walter?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{he signed it, didn't he?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{sure he signed it. you saw him.}
<A>__{phyllis opens the door a crack. both look at the stairs, where dietrichson is going up. phyllis takes her hand off the doorknob and holds on to neff's arm.}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{watch it, will you.}
<A>__{phyllis slowly drops her hand from his arm. both look up as dietrichson goes across the balcony and out of sight.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{listen. that trip to palo alto when does he go?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{end of the month.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{he drives, huh?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{he always drives.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{not this time. you're going to make him take the train.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{because it's all worked out for a train.}
<A>__{for a second they stand listening and looking up as if they had heard a sound.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{it's all right. go on, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{look, baby. there's a clause in every accident policy, a little something called double indemnity. the insurance companies put it in as a sort of come on for the customers. it means they pay double on certain accidents. the kind that almost never happen. like for instance if a guy got killed on a train, they'd pay a hundred thousand instead of fifty.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i see.}
<P>__{(her eyes widen with excitement)}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{we're hitting it for the limit, baby. that's why it's got to be a train.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{it's going to be a train, walter. just the way you say. straight down the line.}
<A>__{they look at each other. the look is like a long kiss. neff goes out. slowly phyllis closes the door and leans her head against it as she looks up the empty stairway. b 4 exterior dietrichson residence (night) neff, briefcase under his arm, comes down the steps to the street, where his dodge coupe is parked at the curb. he opens the door and stops, looking in. sitting there in the dark corner of the car, away from the steering wheel, is lola. she wears a coat but no hat.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{hello, mr. neff. it's me.}
<A>__{lola gives him a sly smile. neff is a little annoyed.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{something the matter?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i've been waiting for you.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{for me? what for?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i thought you could let me ride with you, if you're going my way.}
<A>__{neff doesn't like the idea very much.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{which way would that be?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{down the hill. down vermont.}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{oh, sure. vermont and franklin. north west corner, wasn't it? be glad to, miss dietrichson.}
<A>__{neff gets into the car. b 5 interior coupe (night) (transparency) neff puts the briefcase on the ledge behind the driver's seat. he closes the door and starts the car. they drift down the hill.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{roller skating, eh? you like roller skating?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i can take it or leave it.}
<A>__{neff looks at her curiously. lola meets his glance.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{only tonight you're leaving it?}
<A>__{this is an embarrassing moment for lola.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{yes, i am. you see, mr. neff, i'm having a very tough time at home. my father doesn't understand me and phyllis hates me.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that does sound tough, all right.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{that's why i have to lie sometimes.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you mean it's not vermont and franklin.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{it's vermont and franklin all right. only it's not anne matthews. it's nino zachetti. you won't tell on me, will you?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i'd have to think it over.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{nino's not what my father says at all. he just had bad luck. he was doing pre med at u.s.c. and working nights as an usher in a theater downtown. he got behind in his credits and flunked out. then he lost his job for talking back. he's so hot headed.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that comes expensive, doesn't it?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i guess my father thinks nobody's good enough for his daughter except maybe the guy that owns standard oil. would you like a stick of gum?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{never use it, thanks.}
<A>__{lola puts a stick of gum in her mouth.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i can't give nino up. i wish father could see it my way.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{it'll straighten out all right, miss dietrichson.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i suppose it will sometime.}

<C>__{lola}
<D>__{there he is. by the bus stop.}

<C>__{lola}
<D>__{he needs a hair cut, doesn't he. look at him. no job, no car, no money, no prospects, no nothing.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i love him.}
<A>__{she leans over and honks on the horn.}
<C>__{lola}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{nino!}

<C>__{lola's voice}
<D>__{over here, nino.}

<D>__{this is mr. neff, nino.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{hello, nino.}
<C>__{zachetti}
<P>__{(belligerent from the first word)}
<D>__{the name is zachetti.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{nino. please. mr. neff gave me a ride from the house. i told him all about us.}
<C>__{zachetti}
<D>__{why does he have to get told about us?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{we don't have to worry about mr. neff, nino.}
<C>__{zachetti}
<D>__{i'm not doing any worrying. just don't you broadcast so much.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{what's the matter with you, nino? he's a friend.}
<C>__{zachetti}
<D>__{i don't have any friends. and if i did, i like to pick them myself.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{look, sonny, she needed the ride and i brought her along. is that anything to get tough about?}
<C>__{zachetti}
<D>__{all right, lola, make up your mind. are you coming or aren't you?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{of course i'm coming. don't mind him, mr. neff.}
<A>__{lola steps out of the car.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{thanks a lot. you've been very sweet.}
<A>__{lola catches up with zachetti and they walk away together. b 10 interior coupe neff looks after them. slowly he puts the car in gear and drives on. his face is tight. behind his head, light catches the metal of the zipper on the briefcase. over the shot comes the commentary:}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{she was a nice kid and maybe he was a little better than he sounded. i kind of hoped so for her sake, but right then it gave me a nasty feeling to be thinking about them at all, with that briefcase right behind my head and her father's application in it. besides, i had other problems to work out. there were plans to make, and phyllis had to be in on them...}
