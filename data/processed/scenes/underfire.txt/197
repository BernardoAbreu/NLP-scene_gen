<L>__{exterior plaza of managua's largest cathedral later day}
<A>__{thousands of people have gathered to celebrate in loud and joyous singing, led by a group on the highest cathedral steps, surrounded by revolutionary leaders waving to the crowds. a singing group sings a song to nicaragua, and a song to rafael. rafael's body in a fancy casket is carried in through the crowd to wild cheering and singing. high over the pallbearers' heads it moves through the crowds. price and claire stand to the side watching it all. the celebration is joyously infectious, and for the moment we can forget the bloodshed, forget the problems that lay ahead, forget even the death of alex. price pulls out a camera and begins taking pictures of the celebration. isela is at the microphone with other guerrilla leaders. claire works through the crowd with her mike held high, recording the singing of the crowd. price backs under the awning of a stand selling refreshments, and especially rum and coke mixtures known suddenly and triumphantly as "nicalibres." as price snaps off pictures a voice from an american in casual street clothes drinking at the temporary bar.}
