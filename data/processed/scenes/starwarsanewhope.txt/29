<L>__{exterior tatooine desert lars homestead afternoon}
<A>__{the jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives, including artoo and threepio, in front of the enormous sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house. the jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. the shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be. out of the shadows of a dingy side building limps owen lars, a large burly man in his mid fifties. his reddish eyes are sunken in a dust covered face. as the farmer carefully inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump shouldered nephew, luke skywalker. one of the vile little jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language. a voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead. luke goes over to the edge and sees his aunt beru standing in the main courtyard.}
<C>__{beru}
<D>__{luke, tell owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks bocce.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it looks like we don't have much of a choice but i will remind him.}
<A>__{luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment for sale with the jawa leader.}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{i have no need for a protocol droid.}
<C>__{threepio}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{sir not in an environment such as this that's why i've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that...}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{what i really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{vaporators! sir my first job was programming binary load lifter... very similar to your vaporators. you could say...}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{do you speak bocce?}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{of course i can, sir. it's like a second language for me... i'm as fluent in bocce...}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{all right shut up!}
<P>__{(turning to jawa)}
<D>__{i will take this one.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{shutting up, sir.}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? i want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but i was going into toshi station to pick up some power converters...}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{you can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. now come on, get to it!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{all right, come on! and the red one, come on. well, come on, red, let's go.}
<A>__{as the jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the sandcrawler, artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend threepio. he is restrained by a slimy jawa, who zaps him with a control box. owen is negotiating with the head jawa. luke and the two robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astro droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{uncle owen...}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{this r2 unit has a bad motivator. look!}
<C>__{owen}
<P>__{(to the head jawa)}
<D>__{hey, what're you trying to push on us?}
<A>__{the jawa goes into a loud spiel. meanwhile, artoo has sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract attention. he lets out with a low whistle. threepio taps luke on the shoulder.}
<C>__{threepio}
<P>__{(pointing to artoo)}
<D>__{excuse me, sir, but that r2 unit is in prime condition. a real bargain.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{uncle owen...}
<C>__{owen}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what about that one?}
<C>__{owen}
<P>__{(to jawa)}
<D>__{what about that blue one? we'll take that one.}
<A>__{with a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged astro droid for artoo.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah, take it away.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{uh, i'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. he really is in first class condition. i've worked with him before. here he comes.}
<A>__{owen pays off the whining jawa as luke and the two robots trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{okay, let's go.}
<C>__{threepio}
<P>__{(to artoo)}
<D>__{now, don't you forget this! why i should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!}
