<A>__{nathan drives. he's dressed in spanking new, freshly starched safari clothes, big shiny new hiking boots. lila sits in the front passenger seat. she is dressed in a costume identical to nathan's, but, as opposed to nathan, she seems awkward in it. she fidgets in it, straightens it, sighs, comes to terms with it, and looks dreamily out the window at the passing trees. she is home. that's all that matters.}
