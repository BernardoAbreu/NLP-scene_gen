<L>__{interior cellar. day}
<A>__{michael opens the door. he turns on a dim light. there is a flight of wooden stairs into the murk of a huge pile of coke, poured in from the street. he goes down to the bottom, and picks up a bucket. he digs in to the coke, and at once it comes tumbling down on him in a cloud of dust.}
<L>__{interior hanna's apartment. day}
<A>__{hanna is at the kitchen table, drinking a glass of milk. she has taken off her jacket and loosened her tie. michael comes in with the two buckets of coal, his face and clothes filthy. she roars with laughter, full throated.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{you look ridiculous, look at you, kid.}
<A>__{michael sees himself in the mirror, but she has already got up, going towards the tub in the corner of the kitchen.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{you can't go home like that. give me your clothes, i will run you a bath.}
<A>__{hanna opens the tap. there's a boiler, and steaming hot water comes out. michael takes off his sweater, then stops.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{what, do you always take a bath in your trousers?}
<A>__{hanna takes his sweater and goes to open the balcony door. he undresses. she puts his sweater on the balcony rail.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{it's all right, i won't look.}
<A>__{on the contrary, she turns and walks straight towards him. michael is naked. hanna takes his clothes from the chair. he gets into the bath. she goes to the balcony. in the bath, he submerges himself. hanna goes out and shakes his clothes out in the open air. when he comes up from under the water, she is laying his clothes back on the chair. she picks up the shampoo and hands it to him.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{wash your hair, i will get you a towel.}
<A>__{michael washes his hair, then submerges again. when he comes back up, hanna is holding out a large towel. he gets out, turning away to hide his erection. from behind, she wraps his body and rubs him dry. then she lets the towel fall. she puts her body against his back, and he realises she's naked. he turns and faces her.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{so. that's why you came back.}
<A>__{michael looks at her, awed.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you're so incredibly beautiful.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{now, kid, you know that's not true.}
<A>__{at once she puts her arms round him and they kiss. michael goes down onto the floor, hanna on top of him. all the time, she's staring into his eyes. he can't take it. he closes his eyes and, about to come, begins to scream. she puts her hand over his mouth to smother the noise.}
