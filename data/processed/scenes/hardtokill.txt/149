<L>__{exterior union station night}
<A>__{sonny has made his way into the parking area, amidst dozens of cars, but he has stopped looking back fearfully, worried about o'malley. o'malley bursts from the exit.}
<C>__{o'malley}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{go! sonny get outta here!}
<A>__{in front of the station, a cab is jacked up; the driver replacing a flat. o'malley starts to run toward sonny past the cab, when suddenly: he is shot in the back by nolan! his lurching bulk crashes into cab, knocking it off its jack to the ground. the tire iron (that's used as a jack handle) springs loose, onto the ground near o'malley. seeing the gunmen, sonny in horror crawls under a car. the cab driver flees for his life. o'malley spins back, draws and tries to fire at the oncoming nolan and turner but he is shot twice in the stomach. turner kicks o'malley in the hand, sending the gun flying off under the cab!}
<C>__{nolan}
<D>__{get the kid! he's under the cars!}
<A>__{nolan and turner sprint off after sonny. sonny rolls from under one to another. nolan and turner try to trap him, peering under the cars but sonny is too agile and cat like. turner crouches down, spots sonny.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{give us the tape, kid and we'll take you home.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{fuck you, jack!}
<A>__{turner aims his gun. suddenly: his head turns to squash as: a bloody o'malley stands over him, bashing him with a tire iron! a crowd of bystanders scream in horror at this horrendous sight.}
