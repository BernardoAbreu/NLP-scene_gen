<L>__{exterior basketball court – a game – flashback}
<A>__{the sun beats down on the blacktop. the players are a mixed assemblage of black and white, jumbled together on different teams.}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{my brother derek was pretty much the backbone to d.o.c….before all the bullshit.}
<A>__{tight on derek. he has a shaved head, a germs t shirt on, and eye goggles. derek brings the ball upcourt as lawrence, a monstrous black man in a blue bandana, blatantly hand checks him.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{bring it on, boy.}
<A>__{derek yo yo ‘s the ball in place and grins at this irony.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{president lincoln was a good man, hunh?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{derek blows by lawrence easily for a left handed layup. big lawrence fouls him hard but it still goes in.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{ten a piece! nice left, daddy.}
<A>__{the chubby seth ryan slaps derek’s hand enthusiastically as they get back on transition. derek’s stares at lawrence as long haired cammeron alexander, in a green bay packer jersey, stp hat and jeans, also congratulates him.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{beautiful fucking left!}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{let’s go, o! all we need is one!}
<A>__{lawrence and derek lock eyes, a look exceeding competitive boundary. a look filled with rage.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{dee up now, seth! use that fat ass and keep him out!}
<A>__{seth and the opposing player bang to get position underneath.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(to derek)}
<D>__{this is my house! and i ain’t fuckin’ losin’ in my house! clear it out!}
<A>__{the six five power forward dribbles beautifully up the court – his teammates clearing out the key. defensively, derek is solid.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{you got nothin’. you do the same move every time.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{you mean this one?}
<A>__{he tries to pass derek but derek’s defense is stifling. with another tricky move, jerome inadvertently puts his left elbow into derek’s face, sending him quickly to the pavement. everybody stops.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{that’s fuckin’ offense!}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{all the way!}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{get the fuck outta here! he was movin’ his feet!}
<A>__{a bleeding derek rises, diplomatically. he stares at the bigger player.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(threateningly)}
<D>__{i’ll go if you want to.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{what’s that?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{if you wanna go…let me know. don’t be throwin’ fuckin’ elbows.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{derek?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i think that would be a mistake, man.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i don’t give two fucks what you think.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{just let me know if you want to.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{derek! come on, man.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{shut the fuck up, seth!}
<P>__{(to lawrence)}
<D>__{what’s it gonna be?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{jesus, man. it was an accident, a’ight?}
<A>__{a bleeding derek removes his goggles and walks over to danny and short haired stacey standing courtside. she has a water bottle and a towel for him. he wipes his bloody lip with the towel, takes a sip, and kisses her. cammeron, sweating hard from his heavy attire, stares at the two.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<P>__{(grimacing)}
<D>__{father v? are you copacetic?}
<A>__{derek ignores him and looks at danny and stacey.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you gotta call offense on that.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{not on point game you don’t.}
<C>__{stacey}
<P>__{((gesturing to lawrence)}
<D>__{fuck that, daddy. that chucker can’t be doin’ that shit…especially to you.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{not on point, honey.}
<A>__{he turns back to the court and walks over to big lawrence. he stands in front of him and checks the ball in. cammeron looks over his shoulder at the beautiful stacey. she looks back, uncomfortably.}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{dee up, cam!}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(to the group)}
<D>__{tens! dee up right now! ball in!}
<A>__{lawrence takes the ball, passes it to the wing, and quickly gets it back. lawrence dribbles up top, makes a marvelous}
