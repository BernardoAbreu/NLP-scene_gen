<ACTION_ALT>__{FACE IN ON THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN}
<ACTION>__{sunny and placid then slowly WE BEGIN DESCENDING UNDERWATER Moving down from the bright surface waters, through layers of fish and marine life... A school of vibrantly colored fish move with the current, their numbers are enormous, their movements in unison. Suddenly out of the darkness a barracuda cuts through the school, taking out four or five before disappearing into the shadows.  The school moves on as if nothing happened, quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only seconds before.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{WE MOVE DEEPER AND DEEPER}
<ACTION>__{Fish disappear, darkness envelopes us.  Cold and lifeless where light has never penetrated...Five thousand feet, ten thousand.  Deeper, where only strange, self-illuminating echoniderms move eerily through the currents.  Then suddenly WE HEAR STATIC from RADIO TRANSMISSION.  THEN VOICES...}

<ACTION>__{Several voices suddenly break into argument..."vegetables?" "shit," "burgers"...Suddenly another voice rises above the others.}
<DIAL>__{BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO Okay, cut the chatter.  You're not out of here, yet.  Who's the hook?  Seven?...You got a hook on container 22?}
<ACTION>__{A pause, then more voices.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(redneck drawl)}
<DIAL>__{The man's asking if you're hooked on 22, you dumb shit. JONES' VOICE/ RADIO Watch your mouth, Sixpack.  Hello, Shack, Seven, here.  I ain't the hook, over.}
<ACTION>__{A light flares out of the darkness, suddenly illuminating an IMMENSE SHAPE--fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal nearly seven feet tall.  It is a motorized diving suit and we see the stenciled name, WILLIE across the front breastplate.  As it pivots we see the stationary worklights around the base of a large underwater mining operation, THE SHACK.  Then a woman's voice.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIE'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(woman's voice)}
<DIAL>__{Six to Shack.  I'm the hook.}
<ACTION>__{INSIDE THE SHACK/ CONTROL ROOM littered with papers, half-full coffee cups, and a confusion of wires and very low-tech, high-tech equipment BECK sits at the monitor controls.  He is younger than we expected, twenties, clean cut good looks.  He'll be a hell of a good- looking man at thirty-five, he just needs to be hardened. From the looks of the coffee cups around him he's on his way.}
<DIAL>__{BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO Okay, Six, let's wrap this container and call it a day.}
<ACTION>__{Above him a bank of monitor screens.  Each one labeled with a crew member's name and providing a video picture from a camera mounted on their helmet.  Beck reaches above him and throws a console switch which activates another monitor labeled ROV.  With a joystick he manipulates an outside camera(the ROV), its picture we see on the monitor.  It is moving.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{UNDERWATER}
<ACTION>__{WILLIE'S POV  The inside of her helmet is a grid of LED gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature, atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure. She stops next to a pair of railroad-like tracks and removes the tool attached to the end of her arm.  The move is practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on a set of egg beaters.  First, she inserts the existing tool into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she disengages the tool.  Next, she selects the next tool from the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into position.  Sixpack's voice comes over the radio.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(under control)}
<DIAL>__{Keep your pants on Sixpack. I promise you'll be inside before "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" comes on.}
<ACTION>__{OVER THE RADIO WE HEAR other men's voices laughing.  They like Willie and cheer her on.  "Tell him, Willie," "Atta girl," etc... Willie CLICKS in her last tool and turns.  Expertly she hooks a large dumpster-like container, the container to what looks like an underwater parachute--A CONTAINER TRANSPORTER--which when filled with oxygen it lifts the massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled-in by a winch.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIE'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Six to Shack...Hook's on.  Ready to winch.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{UNDERWATER MACHINERY}
<ACTION>__{Halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and dumpsters squatting in the gloom.  A winch begins grinding and the big, newly hooked container lurches down the tracks. It comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with several others to complete a set.  We hear BECK'S VOICE.}
<DIAL>__{BECK/ RADIO Ok, that's it.  Come on in.}
<ACTION>__{More motor suited DIVERS appear, their helmet lights glaring.  Their breastplate names catch in the dim lights: COBS, BOWMAN, WILLIE. As they approach the UNDERWATER LOCK, where an elevator will transport them up into the Shack, we see signs of human life:  a basketball goal attached to the side of the building; stickers and signs:  "No Bozos," etc.  A formal sign towers over the entrance.  It says: TRANSOCEAN CORP. SHACK 6.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ON ONE OF THE CREW}
<ACTION>__{He moves behind the others.  Suddenly he freezes in his tracks and slowly rotates his helmet--on his shoulder in the glare of his helmet beam WE SEE the a hideous looking SEA SPIDER.  It's thick legs moving eerily down his arm. Carefully, so as not to disturb the creature, a mechanical motor hand moves into position below it, and in one quick movement, snares it. CLOSE ON METAL WAIST POCKET.  The latch opens and the writhing sea spider is shoved inside.  From the pocket WE MOVE UP the diver's suit until we see the name SIXPACK on the breastplate.  He looks around to see if anyone has noticed then continues on toward the shack. ON TWO DIVERS(JONES AND DEJESUS) They walk together to the Shack.  A Latino VOICE, DEJESUS, comes over the radio singing an old Miller Beer jingle in an exaggerated accent.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{INSIDE ON BECK}
<ACTION>__{As he listens to the singing over the tinny speaker, we see he aches to be a part of their comaraderie, but is alienated by age and rank.  He is the shack boss, management.  He listens as a BOOMING BLACK VOICE joins in off-key.}
<CHAR>__{JONES' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{(O.C.)}
<DIAL>__{Mil-ler's tastes too good to hurry through...}
<ACTION>__{As the singing continues, Beck looks over at an empty chair in front of a bank of equipment monitors.  The vital signs of each miner and his equipment are registered on this console.  The chair in front of them sits conspicuously empty.  This doesn't please Beck, neither does a hand written sign under the console which states:  THE DOCTOR IS OUT . DEJESUS' POV Inside his helmet we see the grid of LED gauges monitoring vital signs.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{ON BECK}
<ACTION>__{DeJesus' scream comes over his radio in the control room. Beck hits the elevator switch--nothing happens.  He hits it again harder and suddenly DeJesus voice is drowned out by the SCREAMING VACUUM PUMPS of the elevator.  It's moving! Beck looks up at the monitor of the interior Lift Lock. INSIDE/LIFT LOCK WE SEE DeJESUS'S SUIT dripping wet.  It stands inside the Lift Lock, ankle deep in greasy bilge water. CLOSE ON HIS EYES, for a moment they remain closed, then suddenly they flutter.  He's alive! THE MESS - LATER The blackboard prominently displayed on the wall of the Mess features neatly stenciled letters that say:  "DAYS TILL PICKUP".  The number scrawled on the chalk-smudged board obviously changes daily.  Right now, it's a "3"... A CLUNK, CLUNK and a Coke can rolls out of a compact COKE MACHINE.  A big, sandy-haired man, SIXPACK, takes the soft drink, pops the top and downs it in one long pull while he looks over an arguing group of deep sea miners:  JONES, Black, athletic, 30's;  COBB, 50's, a career miner with a mouthful of gum;  BOWMAN, 35, attractive, hardened woman, she has seen more of the world than any of them;  WILLIE, twenties, fresh good looks, master electrician, optimist. DEJESUS, Latino, wiry muscles, he keeps his head down, still shaken from his experience. The strain of a month of working two miles beneath the ocean's surface has drawn nerves tight.}

Leadership "how-to" books like The One Minute Manager , etc. line his bookshelf with technical manuals on underwater mining.

The room is spooky even with the lights.  The giant machine suits, we saw earlier outside, hang from racks like sleeping monsters. Willie straps on a utility belt and checks her tools--a motorized screwdriver, a power wrench, a long-necked, laser-tipped soldering iron(looks like a long-necked screwdriver)--then splashes through the bilge water to the control switch and hits the START button.

DeJesus' has posters of the Alps, and the Rockies;  Bowman's has clipped pages from "Gourmet" of meals she dreams for; Cobb's has nothing, as if perfectly content to be where he is instead of somewhere else.
