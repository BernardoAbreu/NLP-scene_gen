<L>__{exterior residential street day}
<A>__{todd pedals his bike through town, carrying a brown paper bag under one arm. he turns down dussander's street. he stops in front of the house and heads for the front door.}
<L>__{interior dussander's kitchen day}
<A>__{dussander emerges from the basement just as todd comes into the kitchen. todd sniffs the air, frowns.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what the fuck happened in here?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{ah, boy... i burned my tv dinner, i'm afraid.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{something's come up. sit down.}
<A>__{dussander's studies todd for a moment. although todd appears calm, his tone reflects a somber, business like attitude.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i see.}
<P>__{(sits at table)}
<D>__{what seems to be the trouble?}
<A>__{todd sets his grade card and the envelope on the table. dussander picks up the grade card and examines it.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{quarterly progress report.}
<P>__{(he reads silently)}
<D>__{you seem to have fallen on the rocks, my boy. one b, three c's and a d. hardly the work of a "national merit scholar," or whatever you call yourself.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{this isn't a joke, dussander. i can't blame this on teachers or honors classes anymore.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{looks like you have a problem then.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i have a problem? you still don't get it. i'm out of excuses. do you know what's going to happen when my dad sees that? he's going to hit the fucking roof. he'll get it all out of me. the truth, you...everything.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{boy, it's not my fault your grades have fallen.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{don't be so sure.}
<A>__{dussander throws todd a dismissive wave. he gets up to get a drink}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{please, you don't spend that much time here. i hardly think }
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(quickly, as if confessing something)}
<D>__{i can't study anymore.}
<A>__{pause. dussander looks at him oddly, a bit surprised. but then opens the cabinet and pulls out a glass, allowing todd to continue.}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(with difficulty)}
<D>__{i try. but it's... different now. i sit in front of my books and start thinking about... about corpses, and electrified fences and people getting strangled with piano wire. all that crap you tell me. the next thing i know it's after midnight. i sit in class like a zombie, ...useless. but that's not the half of it. check out the letter.}
<A>__{dussander goes back to the table and picks up the envelope. he opens it.}
<C>__{dussander}
<P>__{(reading letter)}
<D>__{'dear mr. and mrs. bowden, this note is to suggest that we have a group conference concerning todd's first semester grades. in light of his previous good work in this school, the sudden deterioration in his grades suggest a specific problem which should be addressed before his academic advancement is jeopardized permanently. such a problem can often be solved by a frank and open discussion. i am ready to work out a time for us to meet. in a case such as this, earlier is usually better. sincerely yours, edward french.' who is this edward french, the headmaster?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{french? fuck no. he's a stupid guidance counselor.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{guidance counselor? what is that?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{he guides and he counsels. you read the fucking note. do you realize i could have to go to summer school? me, in there with all those fuck ups. i do not want to go to summer school.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{or to the reformatory.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{boy, ...you have a far greater problem than your school grades . before you speak to me about what they will "get out of you", remember the facts. ...seventy thousand people died at patin. have you forgotten that? to the world at large i am the most despicable of criminals, a monster. do you think i would stand aside and let you turn me in so easily? without a fight? is your american self confidence so bloated that you have never once realized you are an accessory to my crimes. you have criminal knowledge of an illegal alien, and have not reported it. don't you see that? and if i'm caught, i will tell the world all about you. when the reporters put their microphones in my face it will be your name i will repeat over and over again. todd bowden, yes that's his name. how long?... oh, for months, almost a year. he wanted to know everything... that's how he put it, yes everything .}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{they'd never believe you.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{perhaps, perhaps not. it's a gamble. how would you explain all those books you were reading to me? my eyes are not what they were but i can still read fine printerior i can prove it.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{so what? i'd say you tricked me.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{why would i do that?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{for friendship, because you're lonely and had no one in your life. no jury would take your word over mine. a nazi? forget it. just get it out of your head. you can't threaten me and you can't scare me. what you can do is find me a pencil.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{a pencil, what for?}
<A>__{todd sets the small paper bag on the table. dussander opens it and removes a small bottle. the label reads: "ink eradicator." he also removes an x acto knife and a few sheets of rub off letters.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{that will take care of the report card, i think. about that fucking letter, i don't know.}
<A>__{todd sits down at the table. he takes the bottle from dussander and examines the report card.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{fuck... come on, a pencil. a sharp one. with an eraser.}
<A>__{dussander pauses. he knows todd is right. slowly, he goes to the counter and opens a drawer. he rummages through it as todd sits with his back to him. dussander picks out a pencil with an extremely sharp pointerior he holds it point out and approaches todd. he gets closer, the point moves in toward the back of todd's head. he holds the point inches from the boy's neck. he deliberates.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{will this do?}
<A>__{todd grabs the pencil. dussander turns toward the window. he thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{tell me, does this french know your parents in a social way?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{him? fuck, no. they wouldn't mix with a geek like him.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{how about professionally? has he ever called them before?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no. i've never needed it. why?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i have an idea. it will require you to make one phone call.}
