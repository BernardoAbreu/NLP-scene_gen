<A>__{back to criswell.}
<C>__{criswell}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{torture! torture! it pleasures me!}
<A>__{the slave girl pulls with all her might and the chains suddenly pop off the hook. she then pushes the iron doors open and dances out into the clearing. the slave dance concludes.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{i'm so frightened.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you've got a right to be. we're trapped by a bunch of fiends.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{those creatures..!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{don't let them hear you.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{what can we do?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i don't know. i just don't know. but don't give up. we're not finished yet.}
<A>__{shirley closes her eyes and sighs.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{easy shirley, easy! panic won't do us any good! let me think. we've got to stall for time.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{i'm afraid i will fainterior}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{whatever you do, don't do that.}
<A>__{the camera zooms back and we see that the wolf man and the mummy are hiding behind bob and shirley. the wolf man has his hand up to his ear so he can hear what bob and shirley are saying. the wolf man and the mummy then creep over toward criswell's throne. the wolf man whispers into the princess of darkness's ear while the mummy and criswell watch. the princess of darkness gets up from the throne and walks over to shirley. shirley grimaces. the princess of darkness unbuttons shirley's blouse, then marks shirley's abdomen with a red (blood?) cross using her long sharp fingernail. shirley screams. the princess of darkness pulls her long dagger out of her belt and raises it, staring into shirley's eyes. suddenly, criswell yells:}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{hold!}
<A>__{the princess of darkness pauses and looks back at criswell.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{let her continue to learn. the time is not yet right that they should join with us.}
<A>__{the princess of darkness reluctantly puts her dagger back in her belt and tucks shirley's blouse back in. the princess of darkness walks back to criswell's throne. he pulls a human skull out from behind his seat.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{...and what is this?}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{a symbol, master.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{what kind of symbol?}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{she loved the bull ring and the matador. she danced to their destruction. now she dances to her own destruction. her dance is of skulls.}
<A>__{the princess of darkness takes the skull from criswell and throws it dramatically into the clearing. the mexican dance (skull dance) ensues.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{she came to us on the day of the dead.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{el dia de los muertos...a celebration in her country.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{her dance has pleased me.}
<A>__{the princess of darkness snaps her fingers, starting the hawaiian dance (snake dance).}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{with the loss of her lover, this one cast herself into the volcano's fire.}
<A>__{a couple times during the dance, there are abrupt cuts to stock footage of a rattlesnake in a bright daylight shot in tall dry grass. (looks like it was from a documentary)}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{she was?}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{as i said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{oh, yes, a religion of sorts.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{it would seem so, master.}
<A>__{hawaiian dance continues, then cut to the mummy and the wolf man.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{i don't like snakes. i remember the one cleopatra used. cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs. you'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.}
<C>__{the wolf man}
<D>__{aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{hurt her? hell, it killed her!}
<C>__{the wolf man}
<P>__{(in agreement)}
<D>__{aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.}
<A>__{hawaiian snake girl continues to dance.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{we had lots of snakes in my ancient egypt...slimy, slinky things.}

<D>__{when i was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.}
<C>__{the wolf man}
<D>__{aaarrrgggaahh.}
<A>__{the hawaiian dance ends.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{she pleases me. permit her to live in the world of the snakes.}
<P>__{(audible cue card flip)}
<C>__{criswell}
<A>__{(continuing, after finding his place on the next cue card)}
<D>__{now, i will talk...to the wolf man...and the mummy.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{as you wish, master}
<A>__{the princess of darkness motions for the wolf man and the mummy to come.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{he wants us.}
<C>__{the wolf man}
<D>__{aaahhnnnahnnnn.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{what do you suppose for?}
<C>__{the wolf man}
<D>__{aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{did you do something to get us into trouble again?}
<C>__{the wolf man}
<D>__{aannnnaahhnn.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{did you howl off key at the moon again?}
<C>__{the wolf man}
<D>__{aannnnaahhnn.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{i can't remember doing anything wrong either.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{come!}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{we better go before we make him mad.}
<A>__{the wolf man and the mummy walk over to criswell's throne.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<P>__{(apprehensively)}
<D>__{we are your servants, master.}
<A>__{the wolf man bows to criswell.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{of course you are.}
<A>__{the wolf man and the mummy crouch in fear as they face criswell.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{have we in some way made you angry, master?}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{you know better than that.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{we don't know of anything, master...}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{then why do you shake so?}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{it's not often an emperor like you calls on creatures like us.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{well rest easy, i'm not angry with either of you.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{aaaahhhh.}
<A>__{the mummy sighs in relief and the wolf man nods.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{then it is some service you desire of us.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{you are the keepers of the damned. you two know them all. and i am tired of this usual type of entertainment. i want...a decided change.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{the moon! ...is soon gone!}
<A>__{the princess of darkness points up at the full moon.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{there is little time left for the remainder of the evening's pleasures.}
<A>__{the princess of darkness gets up from the seat at the end of the altar and walks around beside criswell's throne.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{yes, yes yes i know all that.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{at the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{i suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{it would seem so, master}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{ahh, but i declare there is still time for some thing.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{there are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, master}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{ahh, good. then i will see them. dismiss the rest.}
<C>__{the mummy}
<D>__{yes, sir, master.}
<A>__{bob's hands are wiggling, trying to loosen the rope binding his wrists behind his back around the stone column.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{the ropes are coming loose.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{be careful!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i am it's our only chance.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{nothing is worth your life.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{my guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{i'm frightened. i'm so frightened.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{hold on just a little longer, shirley.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{be careful, oh please be careful. we'll never get out of here alive, i know it. i just feel it.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{yes i feel it in my bones.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you're talking nonsense.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{oh, no i'm not. these heathens probably have an open grave for us.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{they wouldn't dare put us in the same grave or would they?}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{i should hope not. i hate you!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{that sudden?}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{yes, that sudden. if it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this. it's all your fault.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(dejected)}
<D>__{...and i thought you loved me.}
<A>__{the princess of darkness is leaning over, covering her mouth and whispering into criswell's ear, looking over her hand back at shirley.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{not yet. i perhaps have other plans for such a pretty one. no matter, i will tell you when and if you may have her.}
<A>__{the princess of darkness crosses her forearms and bows to criswell.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{the wolf man informs me that the next one is the woman who murdered her husband on their wedding night. now she dances with his skeleton.}
<A>__{the skeleton dance begins. the skeleton dance girl, wearing a white dress and long wedding veil, comes into the clearing with a skeleton. she dances with the skeleton, then dances in the clearing for criswell. the skeleton dance concludes.}
<C>__{criswell}
<P>__{(to shirley)}
<D>__{have you not enjoyed the evening's festivities?}
<A>__{shirley is silent and looks downward.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{ahh, that will soon change when you become one of us!}
<A>__{the wolf man leans back and howls. (he tilts his head back so far his fake rubber wolfman mask comes up and you can see his skin at the bottom of his neck)}
<C>__{the wolf man}
<D>__{wwaaaaaaooooooooooaaaaahhgggghhhaaaa aaaaaaaaahhggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh!}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{it would seem that the wolf man would have you for his own!}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{i have promised both the wolf man and the mummy a reward. it could be that you are that reward.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{you need not worry...not just now, anyway.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{leave her alone, you fiend!}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{fiend is it! you will not be so fortunate. your existence will cease within moments. no one wishes to see a man dance...}
<P>__{(looking at shirley)}
<D>__{and you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{if i could get my hands on you...}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{..oh, you could do nothing!}
<P>__{(to shirley)}
<D>__{i can save you much pain.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{leave her alone, i tell you!}
<C>__{criswell}
<P>__{(to shirley)}
<D>__{i do not joke in my proposal.}
<C>__{princess of darkness}
<D>__{she is to be mine!}
<A>__{it is so}
<D>__{spoken!}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{the princess of darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yet i am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. i have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{no. no! no!}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{i repulse you? very well. it seems you have chosen your own fate. live with it! i should say die with it!}
<A>__{bob looks down somberly, then looks over at shirley.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i've got the ropes loose now. i've got my hands free. be careful don't change your expression too much. they must not catch on.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{what can we do against them?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i don't know, yet. we'll just have to watch our chance. when it comes i will know what to do i hope i will know what to do.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{i still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{all right. put it on heavy.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{my old boyfriend tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this. at least he's got brains.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{him!}
<A>__{i will bet he sleeps}
<D>__{with all the lights on.}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{maybe so.}
