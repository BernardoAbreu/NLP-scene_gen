<L>__{ext dock night}
<A>__{headlights blazing in the darkness, nedry's jeep skids to a stop by the dock where the anne b is preparing to leave. the water is very choppy. nedry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground. he begins to drag it through the mud, toward the ship. captain farrell comes to meet him, along with a couple men, who hoist the incubator easily and carry it toward the ship.}
<C>__{captain farrell}
<D>__{good. glad to see you. were you seen?}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{nah. i'm back in five minutes, they'll never know i was gone.}

<D>__{careful with that thing! it's worth more than the ship.}
<P>__{(to the captain)}
<D>__{when's the copter meeting you?}
<C>__{captain farrell}
<D>__{it's not. the storm's coast to coast,}
<A>__{nobody could land on the water.}
<C>__{nedry}
<P>__{(totally panicked)}
<D>__{shit! what's the backup? i don't like this. maybe we should do it another time, i don't like it. i just don't like }
<C>__{captain farrell}
<D>__{shhh! i wired baker, he'll have a man at the dock in puntaremas. we should be able to make that in time.}
<C>__{nedry}
<P>__{(somewhat relieved)}

<C>__{captain farrell}
<D>__{yeah, now relax. i got a lot riding on this too, you know. no one's going to mess up now. baker's not going to mess up. his people won't let him.}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{ok. ok. here.}
<A>__{nedry pulls an aerosol can out of the baggy crotch of his pants.}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{look, this is insulating spray.}
<A>__{close on nedry sprays a big mound of white foam into his hand,}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{in about eight hours, spray down all the eggs with this stuff. it'll keep 'em warm but not too warm. i hope baker has it together with the dock.}
<A>__{back on cruisers, rest area rain drums down on the cruiser. timmy stares out at the dark. lex stares nervously out the side window. timmy picks up the night goggles and snaps them on.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{hey, these thing work great. i can see in the dark and i can see far.}
<A>__{he swivels away from the t rex paddock and looks out toward the ocean. he reaches up and adjusts the knob.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{hey! i wonder if that boat's still there? it is. i think they're getting ready to go.}
<A>__{tim's pov the fluorescent green image of men untying casting lines on the boat. another lightning flash and lex screams and covers her face. she cries.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{timmy, can you}
<A>__{give her the goggles? lex clamps her hands over her eyes. timmy gently nudges her.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{want to look at the boat, lex?}
<A>__{timmy hands her the night goggles. lex dries her eyes and takes a peek with the goggles toward the ocean.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{hey, that fat guy's down there. is he gonna come get us and take us to grandpa?}
<A>__{lex's pov the picture streaks but clearly reveals nedry shouting at the captain. men heave the incubator onto the ship.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{they have one of those things from the room with all the eggs you know, where they help the baby eggs grow up.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{you mean an incubator?}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{what's the commotion?}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{let me see. give them to men, sweetheart.}
<C>__{timmy }
<D>__{uh, dr. grant?}
<A>__{regis grabs th e walkie talkie and tries to silence timmy. he knows he gets there too late and reluctantly lets timmy have it back.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{we saw that computer guy helping 'em load an incubator onto the ship.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{yeah, he's stealing them, dr. grant! he's stealing my grandpa's eggs!}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{nedry? with an incubator? regis??}
<C>__{regis }
<P>__{(finally acknowledges)}

<A>__{on grant he looks sharply at gennaro.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{we gotta tell hammond and arnold right away. how far is it to the mainland?}
<A>__{on timmy he looks at regis.}
<C>__{regis }
<D>__{uh, it's a hundred miles to puntaremas. about a sixteen hour voyage in this weather.}
<A>__{on grant he fiddles with the radio in his cruiser. no r esponse still.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running around costa rica.}
