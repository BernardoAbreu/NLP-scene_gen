<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior the bull and the bear pub table later}
<A>__{ashby sits with the crew, a few empty glasses in front of him. he looks remarkably relaxed, just another guy hanging around with a group of friends.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{she got one leg out from under him. now we had to lean.}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{so then miles walks straight into the creative director's office and says "the code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!}
<A>__{they all break out into laughter.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{so this is our boss, right? he chases me and miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "you're fired! your whole team's fired!" he starts looking for lily, lupus, gordo }
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{but the best part was that he couldn't find gordo! he was in the bathroom. so he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! and there's gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a pc world magazine!}
<A>__{more laughs.}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{i haven't been able to use a public bathroom since.}
<C>__{lupus}
<D>__{especially with the thing!}
<A>__{lupus's non sequitur brings the whole rhythm of the conversation to a grinding halt.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{uh, right... and that was it. that's when we decided to start our own business. no more shithead bosses.}
<C>__{ashsy}
<D>__{i envy you guys. taking a chance like that.}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{masters of our own destiny.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{so far, masters of our own demise. what bank are you with?}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{city bank of manhattan.}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{that's that gillette guy, right?}
<P>__{(off ashby's nod)}
<D>__{you like him? as a boss, i mean.}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{he's . . . he's okay.}
<C>__{gordo}
<P>__{(goading)}
<D>__{come on...}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{more laughs.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what do you do over at your bank, grant?}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{what do i do? i'm the vp of finance.}
<A>__{the group exchanges looks.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{wow. we haven't met with anyone your level yet. vp? so that means there's you, then the p.}
<C>__{ashby}
<P>__{(confidently yeah. that's right.}
<B>__{freeze frame on ashby...}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{here's where a little research comes in handy. corporate banks give out vp titles like calendars. it's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.}
<B>__{resume action}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{well, typically speaking, they're not. as long as you can demonstrate }
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{a capacity for gross fund recovery. yeah, we got that part.}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{that's right. and tech firms... they 'tend to scare people off.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{they scare people off because most people lack vision. vision and balls. present company excluded of course.}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{we know exactly how we're going to make the money back. there in lies the catch 22}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{i don't follow.}
<A>__{an uncomfortable silence falls.}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{jake...}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{it's alright. grant's one of the good guys.}
<A>__{she throws ashby a flirty smile.}
<C>__{lupus}
<D>__{yeah. he's our boy.}
<A>__{lupus casually punches ashby in the arm. it's meant to be a friendly tap, but it's hard enough to jerk ashby's head to the side. ashby lets out an uncomfortable laugh as he rubs his arm.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(leaning in)}
<D>__{listen, what i'm about to tell you, i'm telling you in confidence, okay?}
<P>__{(off ashby's nod)}
<D>__{have you ever heard of a company called big.com?}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{big.com. that internet thing.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{right. the guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the valley do. they get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. microsoft, intel, oracle, whatever. the beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. the bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. so they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.}
<C>__{ashy}
<D>__{sort of like a letter of intent.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{exactly. but the catch 22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. it could kill a deal. but, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{and you have this letter of intent?}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{yes. that's why i wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{we're getting down to the wire. apparently another company has a similar product in r&d right now. if they beat us to it...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{off the record, i'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.}
<A>__{ashby considers for a moment.}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{should we get another round?}
<A>__{jake and lily share an almost imperceptible look.}
