<LOC>__{EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{LONG SHOT of the solitary figure of a WOMAN standing professionally alone at the end of the street. It is a bright, still night. We can HEAR the Woman whistling 'Stardust' merrily to herself. CAMERA TRACKS around her. A Man's footsteps are overlaid. We HEAR the Man start to whistle 'Stardust' under his breath - haltingly at first, then in time with the Woman. As we approach, she glances at us over her shoulder - then turns round for a better look. Her whistling stops - so, at the same moment, does the man's. CLOSE SHOT of DORA - a plump, attractive brunette - still young enough to need two glances at the customers. She smiles at us - and is pleased with the reception. She hesitates for a long moment, weighing us up carefully... and then - half defiantly, half expecting to be laughed at.}

CLOSE SHOT of a man's hand throwing something into the dustbin. It is an empty packet marked Kodak Film.  CAMERA PANS to Dora's house. It stands next to a chemist shop.

<ACTION>__{She switches on a light - and hurries up a flight of stairs. CAMERA TRACKS after her. She changes her tune to 'Goodnight Sweetheart'... and so - under his breath - does the Man who is following her. A woman with hair like a two-toned car comes down the stairs, winks at Dora - looks at us for a moment with great curiosity... winks... then passes out of camera. Dora reaches the landing - we are close behind her.}

There is a gentle whirring purring sound. CAMERA HOLDS ON Dora - she is staring at something with great curiosity. It turns quickly to bewilderment - and the bewilderment to fear. She steps back from CAMERA - but CAMERA won't have it. Dora is now staring at something in horror - she opens her mouth to scream - a shadow falls across her face. The sound purrs on.}

One half of the room is used for processing, and the other half for filming - and for trade shows. The two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perched all shapes and sizes of cameras, their spectacles glinting in the light. In the processing half two benches (a 'dry' bench and a 'wet' bench) face each other against opposite walls. There are three sinks above the 'wet' bench and an outburst of equipment above the 'dry'. This part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps frowning in the ceiling above the benches. The other part of the room has a window at the far end of it. Heavy drapes are putted across it.
