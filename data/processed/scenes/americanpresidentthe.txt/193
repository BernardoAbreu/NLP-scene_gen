<D>__{we lost quincy, too.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{did he give a reason?}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{he thinks your numbers aren't likely to rebound.}
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{we're three votes down again, sir.}
<A>__{there's a pause before ...}
<C>__{kodak}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{mr. president, as of this morning, sydney only needed one more vote. the motown three have gotta be scared blind. i don't think there'll be a better opportunity.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{the press is expecting an announcement on the crime bill by the sate of the union.}
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{if you agree to stick 455 in a drawer until after the elections, they'll give you the three votes.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and we declare victory, sir.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{we said as a last resort.}
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{we're there, sir. the state of the union is 48 hours away.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{no. come on. there's gotta be three votes someplace else.}
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{there isn't.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{bullshit, leon. there's gotta be somebody we haven't }
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{there isn't, sir.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{storch.}
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{what about storch?}

<C>__{kodak}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{that one too, sir.}
<A>__{shepherd is stopped.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{mr. president, i think we have to do it.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{she is one vote away, a.j. it's important legislation that for the first time has a legitimate chance. i think she deserves every possible opportunity to }
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{she? you meant "it," didn't you, sir? you meant the "important legislation" deserves every opportunity.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{lewis, shut up.}
<A>__{there's a horrible silence in the room. shepherd has locked eyes with lewis.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{you got something to say to me?}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{respectfully, sir. i think we should examine the new poll for more than its value as a box score.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{examine what? they don't like that i'm going out with sydney.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{it's not that simple, sir. i think this poll helps bribg a murky problem into specific relief.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{whose problem we talking about, lewis? yours? you worried about your job? this poll isn't talking about my presidency. this poll is talking about my life. two hundred and sixty four million people have decided }
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{mr. president, two hundred and sixty four million people don't give a damn about your life. they give a damn about their own.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{all right, that's enough.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{mr. president, you've raised a daughter almost entirely on your own, and she's terrific. what does it say to you that in the last seven weeks, 59 percent of this country has begun to question your family values?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{the president doesn't answer to you, lewis.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{oh yes, he does, a.j. i'm a citizen, this is my president, and in this country it is not only permissible to question our leaders, it is our responsibility. but you already know that, mr. president, because you have a deeper love of this country than any man i've ever known, and i want to know what it says to you that in the past seven weeks 59 percent of americans have begun to question your patriotism?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{look, if people want to listen to bob rumson }
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{they don't have a choice! rob rumson's the only one doing the talking. people want leadership. and in the absence of genuine leadership, they will listen to anyone who steps up to the microphone. they want leadership, mr. president. they're so thirsty for it, they'll crawl through the desert toward a mirage, and when they discover there's no water, they'll drink the sand.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<P>__{(evenly)}
<D>__{lewis, we've had presidents who were beloved, who couldn't find a coherent sentence with two hands and a flashlight. people don't drink the sand, 'cause they're thirsty, lewis. they drink it 'cause they don't know the difference.}
<A>__{the room is slightly stunned by what their president has just said. shepherd picks up the polling data and heads to the door...}
<C>__{shepherd}
<P>__{(continuing; on his way out)}
