<L>__{interior california pizza kitchen day}
<A>__{kaufman, hair combed, sits nervously in a booth, watching alice. he tenses as she comes up to him. she smiles warmly.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{hi!}

<D>__{hey! some key lime pie for ya today?}

<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{thank you. that's really sweet of you.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{still reading about orchids, i hope.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{yes, i am, in fact! beautiful flowers.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{a friend of mine has a pretty little pink one, grows right on a tree branch.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{that's what's called an epiphyte.}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(pointing at him excitedly)}
<D>__{right! boy, you know your stuff, huh?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{not really. i'm just learning. epiphytes grow on trees, but they're not parasites. they get all their nourishment from the air and rain.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{well, i'm impressed. that's great.}
<A>__{awkward pause.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{there are more than thirty thousand kinds of orchids in the world.}

<A>__{alice turns back, still smiling.}
<C>__{kaufman }
<D>__{i'm going up to this orchid show on saturday in santa barbara and i }
<A>__{alice's smile slips away. her warmth dissipates.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{oh, um, well }
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i apologize. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{so i will be right back with your pie then.}
<A>__{he nods, watches alice walk away and say something to another waitress. the other waitress looks over at him. he sweats.}
<C>__{kaufman }
<D>__{i am fat. i am old. i am repulsive.}
<A>__{the other waitress brings his pie. he smiles a thank you.}
