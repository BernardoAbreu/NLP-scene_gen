<A>__{sleazy whores lounge around, women at the very bottom of life. they stir and try to look more appealing as the two well dressed gentlemen enter.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{aramis... these are... these are whores!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{so was mary magdalene, and our lord loved her.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{did she have tits like that?}
<A>__{a greasy, disgusting pimp shuffles over.}
<C>__{pimp}
<D>__{what do you want? white? black? both?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{no. we want you, father belles.}
<A>__{the pimp reacts with fury, drawing a pistol.}
<C>__{pimp}
<D>__{get out! now! i will kill you where you stand!}
<A>__{aramis slowly falls to his knees, before the pimp.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{bless me, father, for i have sinned.}
<A>__{the pimp the former father belles, the same man we saw as the priest who prayed with the queen at the royal birth in the opening shoves his pistol at aramis' face.}
<C>__{pimp}
<D>__{don't! get out!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i have sinned. and no other priest's assurance of forgiveness can mean as much as yours. tell me that i can be forgiven, no matter what i have done.}
<A>__{aramis' eyes are hypnotic, staring deep into the fallen priest's soul. porthos is bug eyed, certain aramis' head is about to be blown apart.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{he's going to kill you, aramis.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.}
<A>__{he stares at the pimp. the pimp's finger trembles on the trigger.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i have come to help you make it right. i have come to take you home.}
<A>__{the pimp shakes convulsively; he drops to his knees, bows his head, and weeps.}
