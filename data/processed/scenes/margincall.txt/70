<A>__{a very tight shot of seth sitting fully clothed on the toilet with the lid on. he is crying very, very intensely but almost silently. he puts his head in his hands and just once or twice lets out a loud noise. eventually someone comes into the room and he hears the person go over to the sink and start running water. seth tries to stop himself from crying. eventually he accepts that the guy is not leaving and he comes out of the stall and walks over to the sinks. jared is standing in front of the mirror with his shirt off shaving. his new shirt and tie are on a hanger next to him. seth walks up to a sink next to him and it is very obvious that he has been crying. he undoes his collar and starts to wash his face. finally jared speaks.}
