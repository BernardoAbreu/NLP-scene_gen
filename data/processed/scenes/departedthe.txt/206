<L>__{int colin's apartment later}
<A>__{colin is in the shower. madolyn moves into the kitchen and puts the kettle on. she checks the mail, lying there on the counter. it's tied with a string. she undoes the string and sorts through the mail. suddenly, she freezes looking at: an oversized envelope addressed to colin: [colin sullivan, 20 pickering street, apt tk, boston, ma, zip tk], with a return address of wm. costigan, 13 conant st., boston, etc., etc.] madolyn stares at the envelope, listening to the shower going. billy has written to her fiance. she starts to put the envelope down, and then realizes...she has to hide it...she has to open it. inside the envelope is a jewel case: exile on main street. and a note: play me now. madolyn puts the cd into the machine. she puts on the headset and listens...and listens. colin comes out of the bathroom, dressed in jeans and t shirt, barefoot, his hair wet. he looks at madolyn, realizing that something is wrong.}
