<L>__{exterior alley night}
<A>__{there is a bustle of activity. setting up barricades, uni formed officers are trying to keep new crews and curious onlookers at a distance.}
<B>__{detective lt. moran}
<A>__{lean, fortyish, and comfortable with the gore in front of him, is inspecting the corpse with a medical examiner.}
<C>__{examiner}
<P>__{(studying body)}
<D>__{real clean. no sawing action at all. whatever it was did it in one swipe.}
<P>__{(looks up at moran)}
<D>__{like the other one.}
<A>__{moran gestures to a sword, wrapped in plastic, lying nearby.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{what about that?}
<C>__{examiner}
<D>__{hasn't any blood on it.}
<C>__{moran}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{about the only thing that doesn't.}
<C>__{examiner}
<D>__{i will give it a closer look when i get back.}
<B>__{brenna cartwright}
<A>__{pretty but not beautiful, thirtyish, she exudes a sort of insolent intelligence. an officer sees her duck under a police barricade.}
<D>__{officer #3 come on brenna, you know better than that.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{i'm invited.}
<A>__{she walks to where the medical examiner is organizing his equipment.}
<C>__{brenna}
<P>__{(greeting)}
<D>__{mr. levine...}
<A>__{the examiner turns and smiles.}
<C>__{examiner}
<D>__{hope this isn't past your bedtime.}
<A>__{brenna looks to the now sheeted corpse, blood flowing from where the head should be.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{doesn't have a head, does he?}
<C>__{examiner}
<D>__{this one came unassembled.}
<A>__{lt. moran is standing near.}
<C>__{moran}
<P>__{(no warmth)}
<D>__{just show her what she came for, tom.}
<C>__{examiner}
<P>__{(stands, taps brenna's arm)}
<D>__{come on, this is more your line of work.}
<A>__{brenna and the examiner walk the few yards from the corpse to the sword.}
<C>__{examiner}
<D>__{how's your uncle? i hardly ever see him anymore.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{the examiner stops and gestures to the weapon clothed in forensic plastic.}
<C>__{examiner}
<D>__{there you go.}
<A>__{brenna's expression changes to interest as she kneels down beside it.}
<C>__{examiner}
<D>__{didn't look like it came from "toys are us", that's why i called you.}
<C>__{brenna}
<P>__{(looks up in moran's direction)}
<D>__{didn't think it was my buddy over there.}
<C>__{examiner}
<D>__{figured you knew more about swords than i did.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{claymore.}
<C>__{examiner}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{scottish claymore. take a french epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.}
<C>__{examiner}
<D>__{you're the expert.}
<C>__{brenna}
<P>__{(runs hand along hilt, slightly confused)}
<D>__{it's in good condition.}
<B>__{richard taupin}
<A>__{is being put in the rear of a patrol car. brenna studies his face in the half gloom. there's something different about him. a steadiness.}
