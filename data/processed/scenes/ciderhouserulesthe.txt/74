<L>__{exterior coast of maine day (later)}
<A>__{homer and wally sit on the beach a short distance from candy's blanket. she appears to be asleep. wally looks in her direction before he speaks to homer.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{it's called the burma run. it's about a seven hour round trip flight between india and china.}
<A>__{wally draws a crude map in the sand.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{"burma run" because you fly over burma...}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{and over the himalayas. that's called flying over the hump.}
<A>__{on candy's face: she's not asleep; she's listening.}
<C>__{homer }
<D>__{at what altitude?}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{i've got thirty five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet that's the first mountain pass.}
<A>__{homer looks at wally, thoughtfully.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{what lousy luck i mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!}
<C>__{wally}
<P>__{(conspiratorially)}
<D>__{actually, i volunteered.}
<A>__{homer is shocked; he looks back at candy, lowers his voice.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{it's the flying, right? you love to fly, don't you?}
<A>__{wally nods; he also gives a look in candy's direction before he responds.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{i love the bombing, too. but there's also the himalayas they have the most wicked air currents in the world. i wouldn't miss flying there for anything.}
<A>__{homer's smile suggests that he's impressed, but that he wouldn't have wally's enthusiasm for the task. wally laughs and puts his hand on homer's shoulder.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{oh, i would love that, wally.}
