<L>__{interior guaspari bedroom day}
<A>__{the woman roberta guaspari demetras (38) retrieves the photo album from the floor, looks at a photo and removes it. she's a beautiful woman with large, expressive eyes, but right now she looks like hell. she stares at the photo it's the two couples dancing. a quick glimpse of hurt on her face, then her jaw tightens and she rips the picture in half. there's muffled talking outside the door, and then two young boys' voices.}
<C>__{boy's voice }
<D>__{can you come out now, mommy? please?}
<A>__{she puts the half with her and her husband on the dresser, then tears the woman off the other half and rips her into pieces.}
<P>__{boy #2 (o.s.)}
<D>__{mommy, nick broke my crayon!}
<P>__{boy #1 (o.s.)}
<D>__{well, lexi hit me and he almost broke... he almost broke my ear!}
<A>__{o.s. arguing "i did not!" "yes you did!" "liar!" etc. as if that one action siphoned all her energy, roberta returns to bed, gets into fetal position, and stares at a point beyond the wall, ignoring the o.s. voices.}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{hear that? your boys need you.}
