<A>__{plates of food are piling up on the shelf in front of the cooks. one of them turns the tv off by remote.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{hey! we were watching that! cook #1 the other girls've got orders up... we're not one 'a them goddamn nelson families, y'know.}
<A>__{betty snatches up several plates to help out. ballard's food appears with a clatter of porcelain.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{it's "nielson"... cook #1 yeah, well, we ain't one 'a them, neither.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{go on now...}
<C>__{darlene}
<D>__{when you gonna get those things fixed, anyhow? cook #1 when you all quit watching 'em for a living...}
<A>__{frustrated, betty delivers several plates and drops them at tables where the people know her by name. she moves off toward four local guys in a booth jangling their empty cups. betty weaves her way over to them and pours refills. when a hand strays around to touch her ass, she pushes it away with her foot and keeps right on pouring. absently, betty takes a look around the restaurant. the other waitresses are gone and no one is behind the grill. alarmed, she pushes through the double doors into the kitchen.}
