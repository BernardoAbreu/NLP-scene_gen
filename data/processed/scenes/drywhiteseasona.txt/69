<C>__{cloete}
<D>__{the security police don't arrest people for nothing, ben. leave it alone.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{they could make a mistake.}
<C>__{cloete}
<D>__{blacks lead double lives. one you see and one you don't. these people surprise you all the time.}
<C>__{viviers}
<P>__{(joking)}
<D>__{that's what i like about them.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{we're not concerned with 'blacks.' we're talking about gordon. a good man and very loyal.}
<C>__{susan}

<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{cloete}
<D>__{i fired him a few days before he was arrested for staying away from work for days. and for the sake of the school i say good riddance.}

<D>__{you have to be extra careful about any influences, oom ben. even their churches are breeding grounds for all sorts of evil ideas.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{gordon's not subversive and definitely not a communist.}
<C>__{cloete}
<D>__{then he's got nothing to worry about!}
<C>__{viviers}

<A>__{his sharp tone surprises everybody. he quiets.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{... look, i know the police often know more than we do. i'm not questioning that. i'm as loyal as the next man. but i do know gordon ngubene... there is something wrong.}

<A>__{ben starts pouring, and offers the first glass to bester.}
<C>__{ben}

<A>__{bester shakes his hand.}
<C>__{bester}
<D>__{nee dankie.}
