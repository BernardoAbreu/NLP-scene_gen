<A>__{at this moment we hear a hideous scraping noise and a tow yard employee whips fletcher's bmw into view and. parks... revealing a prominent new scrape on the door.}
<C>__{fletcher }
<D>__{you scratched my car! tow yard employee where?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{right there! tow yard employee oh that? that was already there.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<P>__{(outraged)}
<D>__{why, you you liar! do you know what i ' m going to do about this? tow yard employee what?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<P>__{(angrier and angrier)}
<D>__{..nothing! because if i take you to small claims court, it will just drain eight hours out of my life, and you probably won't show up, and if i finally got the judgment you'd just stiff me anyway, so what i'm gonna do is piss and moan like an impotent jerk and then bend over and take it up the tail pipe! tow yard employee you've been here before, haven't you?}
<A>__{he flips fletcher the keys and goes.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{well i can't remember when i've had more fun, now if you'll excuse me, i have a class.}

<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{you can't go. it's not fair. taking max three thousand miles away is not fair.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{let' s define "fair." last night a five year old boy was crushed because his father lied to him about coming to his birthday party. fair?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{last night }
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{ was none of my business. when it happened two years ago it was my business, but now i don't have to care anymore. see, that's the magic of div orce . but it does matter to max. everything you do matters to him... and everything you don't do.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{all right now let me tell you something...you're absolutely right. i'm guilty of all charges. i'm throwing myself on the mercy of your court.}
<A>__{audrey doesn't know what to say. fletcher seems very sincere, but she can't trust him.}
<P>__{fletcher {cont'd)}
