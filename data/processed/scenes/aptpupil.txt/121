<A>__{the following series of images appear under music: the quiet wing of this hospital has transformed into a frenzied sea of reporters, cameramen, photographers, and police officers. everyone is struggling for a glimpse of the infamous celebrity through the window that looks into dussander's room. inside, weiskopf and richler are speaking to the doctors. getty stands to the side, instructing the deputy who guards the door. through all of this dussander lies like a fossil in his bed as the bodies whirl around him. darren enters the room to change dussander's iv bag. suddenly the door flies open and a young photographer dashes in, snapping pictures wildly. getty and the other officers descend upon him. the camera flashes. other photographers try to get in but are blocked. pandemonium. yet dussander seems oblivious to the commotion. his eyes are nothing more than glazed slits, his mouth hangs open. darren runs toward the door to help. dussander's eyes open slightly. there is life behind them after all. he turns his attention imperceptibly toward his iv bag... the camera moves away from dussander to the window. outside in the parking lot, groups of protesters have gathered. some hold candles. others chant and wave signs. news reporters surround them.}
