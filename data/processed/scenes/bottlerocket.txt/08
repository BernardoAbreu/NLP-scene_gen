<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{every valuable item in the house was on that list.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{that doesn't make any difference. i bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. they have a very special value for her.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{yeah, but i can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. there's just not time for it.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{then you shouldn't of gone in there, dignan. maybe we should of robbed your house. did you ever think of that?}
<A>__{dignan stops walking. anthony looks back at him. pause.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{dignan turns and starts walking the other way.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{i don't appreciate you ridiculing me.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{how was i ridiculing you?}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{you're making fun of my family. you know there's nothing to steal from my mom and craig. you know exactly what you're saying.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{that's not what i meant, dignan.}
<A>__{they both see something. they keep walking. dignan looks back down the sidewalk.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{did you see that?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{yeah, i saw it.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{i'm lookout.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{dignan, it's got an alarm.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{i don't think so. just reach on in.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{that sets it off.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{no, just do it real quick.}
<P>__{(starts down the sidewalk)}
<D>__{i will meet you down there.}
<A>__{dignan cuts into an alley. anthony turns back. looks at a parked car. looks left and right. walks to the car and reaches in the half open window. an alarm goes off. anthony unlocks the door and opens it. leans inside. grabs a wallet off the seat. a man standing on the sidewalk watches anthony get out of the car. anthony looks at him, then walks down the sidewalk not too fast. he turns down an alley and runs.}
