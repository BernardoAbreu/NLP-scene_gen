<A>__{jack washes his face in the cramped bathroom at the back of the bar. in the background, on the stereo, the white stripes cover one more cup of coffee. jack stares at himself in the mirror. he looks exhausted.}
<L>__{interior bar day}
<A>__{jack is sitting at the back of the bar. he has a good view of the whole establishment: including the entrance and the door to the bathrooms. he lights a cigarette. larry comes in and sits opposite him.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(genuinely shocked)}
<D>__{you started smoking again?}
<A>__{jack exhales.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{guess so.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{since when?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{since now.}
<A>__{the waiter slides over and flicks a cloth at the table.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{cafe?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{due.}
<A>__{the waiter disappears. a beat. larry puts an envelope on the table.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{stockholm account. final installment.}
<A>__{jack takes the envelope and puts it in an inside pocket. larry is about to speak but stops. the waiter reappears and puts down two cups of coffee. larry puts two cubes of sugar in his cup and starts stirring. then speaks low and fast:}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you can't stay here, jack. you won't see `em coming, not in a big city. but you can't go far, either. if the gentlemen whose accounts you closed belonged to brink, gallazzo, simenov any of the first division you have four or five hours at most before every airport, train station, bus stop, toll booth and ski lift from stockholm to skopje is under surveillance.}
<A>__{jack smokes.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so.}
<A>__{not a question. an acknowledgement that larry knows exactly what he's talking about. and jack is listening.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{so. you find a hole somewhere nearby and you crawl into it and you stay put until i say it's safe to come out.}
<A>__{jack's expression is as immoveable as a cliff face.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{turn right outside the bar then second left. via spinetti. you'll find a silver citroen c2 with chieti plates. check the glove box and follow the map. castelvecchio. it's a fucking fortress. literally. and as dead as a graveyard. anyone within a three to five mile radius you'll see `em coming.}
<A>__{he pushes something across the table. a mobile phone in a cellophane bag.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{get there. stay there.}
<A>__{larry finishes his coffee and dabs at the corners of his mouth with a napkin.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{do nothing `till you get my call.}
