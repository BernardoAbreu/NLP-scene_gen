<A>__{the apartment is dark as mika enters and turns on the lights. she looks the place over, then goes room to room, turning on every light in the place. the practiced way she does it makes it clear she does this every night. satisfied she's alone, she goes into the bedroom to change.}

<A>__{mika is curled up in a chair and with kgb report. she turns a page and sees a photocopied drawing of a very intricate floor that we now recognize as the nightingale floor. she reads the caption beneath it.}

<D>__{historical evidence suggests that ibn battuta's journey through the far east brought him into contact with what might be one of the oldest of the nine clans. he travels with a group of orphans that are being taken from a city devastated by war to the shido of the ozunu clan. the people of the surrounding province refer to the shido as "the orphanage."}
<A>__{flashback interior orphanage dojo we see battuta, the 14th century muslim explorer sitting among the original leaders of the ozunu clan, watching two children fight.}

<D>__{battuta describes a ceremonial dinner followed by a display of martial skill. the combatants were children neither beyond the age of ten.}
<A>__{battuta masks his revulsion as the battle continues until one child beats the other to death. small fists gleam with blood as one boy pummels the other.}

<D>__{his host explains that a man's life must be made meaningless compared to the life of the clan. own the meaning of a man's life and you own his heart.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{slowly the light in the bedroom hallway goes out. she freezes, and the world seems to freeze with her. she doesn't move, doesn't breathe. she forces herself to sit slowly up, reaching under her bed for a cricket bat. a car drives by outside. could be nothing. could be everything. despite her fear, she edges toward the door. slowly peers around it. the darkened hall is empty. there is a ticking sound, like someone tapping at a window. could be a tree in the wind. could be something else. she moves slowly through her apartment. every shadow could conceal unseen eyes. she comes to the end of the hall, where the overhead light is out. she flicks the switch on and off. nothing. she reaches carefully toward the light bulb. taps it. the bulb rattles, it's just burned out. she breathes a sigh of relief. then she notices that the living room window is open, the blinds gently swaying from the wind, tapping against the sash. she closes it and locks it. looks to her desk, concerned. did she leave the window open? or is something going on. she goes to her desk, anxious, to check on something. she opens a drawer, revealing a box of tampax. pulls out the tampax to reveal a key... a place no guy would think to check. she unlocks a drawer and takes out an unmarked dvd in a slim plastic case. relieved, she starts to put it away...then stops. is it the same dvd? she moves os. moments later... the tv is switched on, and an image begins to play, revealing a time coded security camera, recording an urban street corner in japan. the tape is riddled with digital noise and artifacting. then, slowly, the digital noise seems to coalesce, to grow shapes. the shadows come to life. then with incredible speed two dark figures start battling it out, their blades striking sparks that are still descending after they've slipped back into the shadows. they emerge over and over, brief flashes of clarity like the perfect arc of a calligrapher's brush describing the wing of a bird. fight. retreat. silence. shadows. sparks. mika hits the pause button and moves closer to the screen, examining the figures. one of the figures is wearing a mask, but the face of the other combatant is revealed, albeit somewhat obscured by the dim light and digital noise. as we push in, we see that it's raizo. but she doesn't know that name yet.}

<D>__{...who are you?}
<A>__{she stares at the fierce beauty of his face and touches the screen gently.}
