<L>__{interior dragon mountain continuous}
<A>__{the wild ride suddenly gives way to a multilevel, cavernous chamber made of ice and columns of basalt rock. it's heavily populated with dragons of all kinds, looming in the shadows. hiccup is dropped in the center. he scrambles to his feet, calling out into the darkness.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{we have to head back for my dragon!}
<A>__{a hissing dragon closes in, sniffing, leering, aggressive. hiccup extends and lights his telescoping dragon blade, waving a swirl of fire around himself. the dragon pauses, intrigued, and then watches hypnotically as hiccup pacifies him with calculated sweeps of the fiery blade. the warrior watches keenly from the shadows. several aggressive dragons close in behind hiccup. hearing their hisses, he quickly stows the blade, replaces a cartridge in its hilt, then flips it around and sprays a perimeter of zippleback gas around himself. he clicks the lighter, igniting a flash ring. the testy dragons recoil. he then reaches through the smoke, offering his open hand. the dragons re approach, sniffing him with calmed curiosity.}
<B>__{on the warrior}
<A>__{... tilting his masked head, curious. he dismounts his dragon and approaches hiccup.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{who are you? the dragon thief? drago bludvist?}
<A>__{the warrior circles hiccup in silence, taking in his gear, his dragon blade, his face.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{do you even understand what i'm saying?}
<A>__{the warrior whirls and hammers his staff. in response, a large dragon ascends from the depths, carrying...}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{toothless!}
<A>__{toothless is dumped on the ground next to hiccup, sopping wet. hiccup rushes to him, petting him reassuringly. toothless coos in relief.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{it's okay. i'm glad to see you, too, bud. you really had me worried there.}
<A>__{the warrior rattles his staff at a nearby dragon. in response, it and the surrounding dragons produce firelight from their throats, spotlighting hiccup and toothless. the warrior sets down his staff and shield, then approaches hiccup, cautiously and animal like. toothless snarls and circles hiccup defensively, but then instantly yields to the stranger's outstretched hand. with a quick, disarming gesture, the warrior lays toothless down in a state of bliss. hiccup is astounded. the warrior's hand continues toward hiccup's face. he recoils, but the warrior persists, finding the faint scar on hiccup's chin, glinting in the firelight. the warrior gasps and retreats a few steps.}

<D>__{could it be? after all these years? how is this possible?}
<A>__{the voice is surprisingly female.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{uh, should i... should i know you?}
