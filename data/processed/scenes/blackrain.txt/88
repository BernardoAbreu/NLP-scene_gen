<A>__{a cramped room rear of pachinko parlor we hear the clattering of the machines outside. the man in the hawaiian shirt, mid fifties and badly in need of a shower, is sitting on the floor studying the photos. ich and nick tower above him. the man says something to nick in japanese, then continues to study the photos.}

<A>__{he grabs the man by his shirt collar and shoves him against the wall. the photos spill to the floor.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{who is she?}
<A>__{he bangs the man's head back against the wall. the man starts babbling in japanese. ich, horrified, tries to pull nick off him.}

<C>__{ich}
<D>__{this man must be treated with respect.}
<A>__{ich bows to the man, apologizes in japanese.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{aw, for christ's sake.}
<A>__{they continue speaking in japanese. they bow to one another again. ich gives the man a glass of water, then motions for him to sit down. nick, impatient, starts for the guy again. ich stops him. the snitch holds up one of the photos, and starts babbling.}
