<A>__{more sirens. a cop takes a radio call as he streaks down the long wide avenue which borders gotham park one of the few streets which is relatively clear. the cop at the wheel goes wide eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief. before their eyes, five snowmobiles appear from the cross streets up ahead and converge at the entrance to gotham park. bringing up the rear is santa claus.}
