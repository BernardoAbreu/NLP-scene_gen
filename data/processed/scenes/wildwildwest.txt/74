<A>__{dr. loveless and his visiting foreign dignitaries are sipping champagne. one of them is holding a little dog in his arms, barking at something in the dark. general mcgrath stands at the railing, uncharacteristically pensive. loveless rolls over, hands him a glass of champagne.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{well, general, it's been a long journey from new liberty.}
<A>__{mcgrath visibly winces at the sound of it.}
<D>__{mcgrath sir, there isn't a day that passes that i don't contemplate it.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{yes, and so do i. so do i.}
<P>__{(reflexively reaches for missing legs)}
<D>__{if i'd only had the scientific understanding of gunpowder and primers that i have today... mcgrath that's not what i meant.}
<A>__{loveless looks at him, puzzled, then gets it.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{oh, you mean the stomach churning carnage that earned you your unfortunate nom de guerre...}
<A>__{loveless speaks for the benefit of the others.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{what was that nickname again? mcgrath}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{'bloodbath' mcgrath... the butcher of new liberty.'}
