The humming takes on the same transcendent tonality to which Mikey has become so accustomed at such moments. Mikey sits down on a metal street guardrail, to ponder the sound and the snaking coil of electricity. A strange look of almost religious wonder overcomes his face, as the power line connects to the guardrail.}

Mike's body lies face down in the wet ice. Ben leans down and turns the body over, then stands back in amazement and saddened shock. He stands there for a moment, then picks Mike's body up, carrying him over the hill and onto the street. We see now that he is parked just a short block from the Williams's house. He bypasses his car and walks directly down the street toward the house. The effort is obviously enormous. He falls from time to time, then gets back up.}
