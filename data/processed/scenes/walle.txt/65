<A>__{eve lies in a seemingly endless warehouse of trash. trash, slime, and robot parts everywhere. piles dumped from a variety of ceiling chutes. eve looks down. computer mice crawl over her. one of them has crawled over her reboot button. switched her back on.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{wall e!}
<A>__{a warning alarm sounds. eve spots a platform, loaded with giant trash cubes. it slides into an airlock. inner shield doors lock and seal.}
<C>__{ship's computer }
<D>__{caution: activating airlock disposal...activating airlock disposal.}
<A>__{the exterior hatch flies open. the vacuum of space instantly sucks out the cubed trash. eve begins to panic. calls out again:}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{wall e!}
<A>__{suddenly, her area is flooded in light. she flinches at the sight of}
<B>__{two giant compactor robots}
<A>__{as they rumble up behind her. headlights for eyes. they bear a slight resemblance to wall e. "wall a" emblazoned on their fronts. each grab a ton of trash at once. eve is swept up with the junk. compact it. spit it out... ...eve now trapped in the side of a giant cube. her cube is picked up. transported to a waiting platform. stacked with other massive cubes. eve discovers... ...wall e trapped in the cube next to her.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{wall e!}
<A>__{he groans. not doing well. again the alarms kick in. the platform slides on rails... ...across the safety line... ...into the airlock... ...the inner shield doors begin to close...}
<B>__{inside the airlock}
<A>__{eve needs to act fast. her gun arm stuck inside the cube. struggles to activate it... ...it cocks. blasts herself free. flies over to wall e. he's stuck deep in the cube...}
<B>__{back in the garbage depot}
<A>__{m o suddenly drops from a ceiling chute. lands in a pile of trash. covered with filth.}
<D>__{m o [primal scream.]}
<A>__{on m o's display pov piles of trash everywhere. the airlock doors closing in the distance. zooms in and locks on wall e. his screen reads: "foreign contaminant".}

<P>__{(beeps)}
<D>__{[i have you now!]}
<A>__{m o speeds towards the airlock.}
<B>__{on eve}
<A>__{tugs on wall e. desperate to free him. he's slow to pull loose... ...the gap in the doors narrows... ...eve's never going to make it... on m o racing towards the doors. he's almost at the airlock... the doors slam tight against his roller arms. m o is stuck. the exterior hatch opens: ...eve yanks wall e free... ...the trash flies out into space... ...she flies against the force... ...fights to reach m o... ...grabs onto his roller...}
<B>__{inside the garbage depot}
<A>__{the wall as notice m o stuck in the door. slam the emergency shut off button for the airlock. the exterior hatch closes. eve and wall e fall to the ground in a heap. safe. m o still stuck in the door. shaking uncontrollably with fear.}
<D>__{m o whoa.}
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{the wall as light up a small work space. eve props wall e up against some trash. he's barely functioning. fades in and out of consciousness. just his red "warning" light flashes on his meter.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{("stay awake.")}
<D>__{wall e...}
<A>__{eve gently opens his chest cavity. examines the damage. carefully pulls out his circuit board. charred. shorting out. irreparable. she flies off into the depot. searches for a new circuit board. m o dutifully cleaning wall e. finishes up. his display pov reads: "all clean." m o closes up. satisfied. wall e feebly offers his hand in gratitude.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(weak)}
<D>__{wall e.}
<A>__{m o stares at the filthy hand. cleans it. then shakes.}
<D>__{m o m o.}
<A>__{they sit in awkward silence for a beat.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(really?)}
<D>__{m o? m o m o. wall e}
<P>__{(got it.)}
<D>__{m o.}
<A>__{eve returns with found circuit boards. shows each one to wall e. will any of these work? he shakes his head with a frail "no." wall e opens his compactor. pulls out the plant.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(weak)}
<D>__{di...rec...tive.}
<A>__{eve holds the plant. her "return to axiom superior" flashes in her display. she considers it for a moment... ...then tosses the plant to the floor. i don't care about the plant anymore. she holds her hand out to him.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{directive.}
<A>__{wall e struggles to lift his hand to eve's. he reaches out... ...and bats her hand away. surprises eve. wall e pushes past her. crawls over to the discarded plant. gives it back to eve.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(weak)}
<D>__{errr.....}
<A>__{eve can't make out what he is saying. wall e fumbles around his box. pulls out... ...the zippo lighter. lights it. eve stares at the flame.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{earth?}
<A>__{wall e nods.}
<D>__{wall e earth.}
<A>__{he moves his binocular eyes up and down. like the time he fixed his broken eye. you can fix me, eve. with spare parts in my truck. the truck that is back on...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{earth! earth!}
<A>__{her eyes light up. she understands! no time to lose. she scoops him up...}
<D>__{wall e m o? m o}
<P>__{("i'm comin'!")}
<D>__{wall e!}
<A>__{m o rushes over to wall e. hangs onto his igloo latch with his roller. eve raises her gun arm... ...blasts a hole in the ceiling. takes off with the two of them. up through the garbage chute. the wall as wave goodbye.}
