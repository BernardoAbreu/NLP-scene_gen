<L>__{ext ship night}
<A>__{...aboard the "alexander nevsky," along for the ride whether we like it or not. there are men all around us, dark screaming figures glimpsed and half glimpsed, heavy oilskin clothes flapping in the gale. a group of men are in a life or death tug of war}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{pull, you bastards! pull!}
<A>__{riiiiippp! all eyes turn skyward as the uppermost sail tears loose, the heavy canvas shredding away in huge billowing tatters. the jib arm wrenches free and plummets toward us, trailing rope and fabric. the men dive aside as the jib smashes into the deck like an exploding bomb. splintered shards of wood cartwheel through the air like shrapnel. walton catches a glancing blow to the head and slams face down on the pitching deck. grigori, the first mate, scrambles to walton's aid. walton shoves him off, pushes painfully to his knees. lightning throws his face into a stark relief map of pain and fury: blood is streaming from his hairline, freezing in his eyes, staining his teeth. he gazes up at the mainsail, still intact and straining against the wind. we hear a huge crack! the base of the mast is starting to give.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{cut the damn rigging free before we lose the mast!}
<A>__{long handled axes are grabbed from their mounts. frantic men begin hacking at the ropes. walton snatches an axe from a passing crewman and elbows his way to the front. he attacks a guy rope with primal fury, camera rising and falling with the motion of his axe. suddenly, a chilling cry from high above:}
<C>__{lookout }
<D>__{iiiicebeeeeerg!}
<A>__{the crow's nest (mast #2) the lookout is lashed to the mast by means of a safety rope knotted at the chest. he points ahead. walton and the others spin to look as a panoramic shot of the barents sea reveals a magnificent vista of storming fury. the ship is heading into an enormous field of icebergs dotting the ocean like boulders in a quarry, the nevsky is plying these waters like a man running pell mell through a mine field. an iceberg passes massively and unexpectedly in the foreground, rumbling within yards of the camera, wiping us into darkness...}
