<L>__{exterior police station maryland day rain}
<A>__{ramirez exits with jack and starts across the street in the rain.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{i got to have time to think it over.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{there isn't any time. he's on his way to east berlin. we have word he's planning another attack in europe. he'll be there maybe four days at the most.}
<A>__{ramirez stops dead right in the middle of the street. the traffic swirls around them.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{hey, i don't know what to do anymore, okay? i almost killed some little kid's father today. i don't know about anything anymore.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey, he was a baseball dad. he deserved it. besides, from what i heard his kid was out, so what's the beef?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{i don't know if i could come back from it again.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what happened to i want the son of a bitch dead? you think carlos has had a change of heart and turned nice all of a sudden?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{don't tell me about carlos, jack. i know exactly who carlos is. i know a hell of a lot better than you do. but, maybe there's more important things to me, like keepin' from goin' crazy... like gettin' back to bein' me instead of me bein' some kind of fuckin' maniac.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you want to get back to bein' you? then finish it. kill him. kill him and he's dead and it's over with. you walk away from it now and what do you think you're gonna be like the next time you read that that son of a bitch blew up some airplane full of women and kids.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{hey, the guy deserves to be dead. i know that.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this isn't abstract, annibal. you're walkin' around with his face. sooner or later one of the bad guys is gonna see it like koj did, and next time amos won't be there to take the bullet for you. carlos doesn't forget. you help me get him or you're never gonna know when he's comin' after you... listen to me kid. i don't have any friends, no family, no nothin'. the only relationships i ever had that mattered to me were with the people i killed. but i... i fucking created you! you can't just walk away now.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{you did create me, didn't you... from the beginning... that kid in the hospital in bethesda... when i was supposed to be the doctor... it was all bullshit, wasn't it? all an act...}
<A>__{there is a long pause. jack turns cold as ice.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this doesn't have anything to do with you and me. it's you and carlos. you help me kill him... or i swear to you... i will make sure he knows about you... i will use you for bait. you and your whole fuckin' family too.}
<A>__{ramirez grabs him and throws him against a parked car. he begins choking jack. he may well kill him. though ramirez doesn't see it at first, jack's gun is already out. jack nudges ramirez in the stomach with it. jack is choking, unable to speak, but the gun is speaking for him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{huh? huh?}
<A>__{ramirez looks down and see the gun and loosens his grip.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you want to try and kill me, that doesn't solve your problem, pally. you've got a carlos problem. that's the guy you've got to kill. that's what it's all about now... you... and your family... or him.}
