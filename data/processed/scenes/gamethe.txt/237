<A>__{the door shuts behind them, the stairs only lead up.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{shit, how do we get out }
<A>__{christine stomps his foot and elbows his gut, breaks free and bolts up the stairs. schuyler catches his breath and pursues. beneath him, the stairwell door opens, guards pursue.}
<L>__{189. e x t . c r s r o o f n i g h t}
<A>__{a high ledge surrounds the roof on all four sides, a roof entrance at each side as well. the number "636" is painted large for helicopters; there are air conditioning vents, ducts, etc. a muffled alarm sounds as christine bursts through the door, followed by schuyler. she spins, her back to the edge of the atrium, a black pit in the center of the roof with a sunken glass skylight, a white railing around it. schuyler slams the door, a large number 1 painted on it in blue. he throws the heavy bolt. he and christine circle each other warily, his gun trained on her. pounding from the other side, muffled voices that can't be heard. for the first time, christine focuses on the gun in his hand, then clutches the railing.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{wait a minute. what's that?}
<A>__{schuyler addresses her as if speaking to a child:}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{it's my gun...}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{we didn't give it to you? where did it come from?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{a gun store.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{we searched your house!}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{guess you fucked up again.}
<A>__{christine touches her ear, listening to something, then puts her hand to her mouth, speaks urgently.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{he's armed, he's got a real gun. real situation, real }
<A>__{schuyler steps forward and violently wrenches the ear piece and hand mike away from christine, the wire tears her blouse open.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{yeah, it's real all right.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{schuyler this is all fake , tricks, it's all part of the game }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{stop it. every word out of your mouth is a lie }
<A>__{christine's desperately panicked, fumbling for words.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{the key!! they, we gave you a key to the elevator! why would we do that?! we wanted you to come up }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{of course you did. so you could kill me or, or frame me for murder }
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{no, no, it's the game!! blanks, squibs, high tech special effects, none of it's real! just open that door and i will show you!}
<A>__{schuyler hesitates a moment, looking in the direction of the door.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i open the door and i die.}
<A>__{on the door pounding desperate, but the alarm drowns out the sounds of voices on the other side. schuyler turns quickly as she takes a step towards him. he points the gun at her again. he looks ready to use it. the following dialog overlaps and collides, growing aural chaos }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{you move again i swear i will kill you, you bitch.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{think about it!! they followed you every step of the way, the cab, in the trunk, we had a diver }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{they? we?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{ the guy in honduras, the cop on the train, there was always a safety net, always }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{shut up, shut the fuck up!!}
<A>__{axes dent the metal door, which bulges. he looks at the monitor in his hand, the one he tore from her body, putting it in his own ear, letting the rest of the device dangle.}
<C>__{radio voice }
<D>__{ just hang in there, keep talking him down, we're on our way }
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{we've been trying to end it since you got back, our people came to your house, they tried to bring you in from the subway, you kept running, you weren't supposed to keep getting lost }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{you just said you wanted me to come here you're making this up as you go along!}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{please sky, please. take a breath and think about it!}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{stop. fucking. with my head!}
<A>__{schuyler runs a hand over his sweating forehead, the gun trembling in his hand. christine's regaining control. schuyler's mind whirls, he groans, almost crying as he considers for the first time that she might be telling the truth. she steps closer.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{you're all right, it's ok, just relax...}
<C>__{radio voice }
<D>__{are you there? how's he doing?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{please... when you open the door, the game ends... just open the door... bill fisher's out there, he's fine, nobody got hurt. why would we do the crazy things we did, if it wasn't part of a game? we thought you knew that...}
<A>__{he looks at her, almost ready to lower the gun. he raises his bloody hand to his lips, about to taste it.}
<C>__{radio voice }
<D>__{ we're at the north entrance, number 2, just a few more seconds and we'll nail him }
<A>__{schuyler's eyes dart toward another doorway, on the other side of the atrium, like the one that's bolted. the number 2 is painted on it in red. the handle starts to turn just as christine lunges at him to wrest the gun away. schuyler comes to his senses, struggling. the gun goes off, the report should be deafening. he spins, points the gun at door #2 and fires again, several times. the alarm stops silence. christine stiffens, falls backwards onto the ground, clutching her blood drenched stomach. schuyler just stares. dark blood spills from her mouth as she chokes in pain...}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{oh god. i blew it... we blew it...}
<A>__{door #2 opens and david steps through. he wears a brightly colored, silly looking party hat, carries a magnum of champagne bearing a huge bow that reads, "surprise." blood pumps from his chest. he drops the bottle, which shatters... david collapses amidst the broken glass. a blow of the axe severs the deadbolt and door #1 flies open behind schuyler. feingold is the first of a group to come charging through, he wears a tuxedo with a rose in the lapel, holds the axe. schuyler spins, points the gun at this axe wielding man, then, utterly stunned, lowers it in disbelief. feingold looks from schuyler to the wounded christine her agony is painful to watch. he drops the axe with a clatter and runs to her side, kneels. his voice cracks.}
<C>__{feingold}
<D>__{you shot her!? no!}
<P>__{(looking toward david)}
<D>__{qh god no...}
<A>__{the guard and security man come out on the roof looking very disturbed, followed by the rasta and a few others. many are dressed for a party now. feingold looks to their horrified faces.}
<C>__{feingold}
<D>__{he fucking shot them!!}
<C>__{rasta}
<D>__{i will call an ambulance.}
<A>__{the rasta dashes downstairs. schuyler backs away, drops the gun, staggers over to david. he's gasping for breath. crs employees give the brothers a wide berth, move toward feingold and christine.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{david, david, no, no }
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh god, oh god, sky, save me, i don't wanna die, i don't wanna }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{you're not gonna die. i'm here, you're not gonna die...}
<A>__{david's already dead, eyes wide, body limp. with feingold and christine. he holds his colorful cummerbund over her stomach to staunch the bleeding. she chokes in pain.}
<C>__{feingold}
<D>__{hang on, just hang on, you're gonna make it }
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{that stupid...}
<A>__{they stare over at schuyler, registering david's death. schuyler is now drenched in his brother's blood, rocking him in his arms. most of the assorted crs people move to get out of the building before the cops show, murmuring amongst themselves in fear.}
<C>__{feingold}
<D>__{oh god. i thought you could handle it. all the tests... they said you could handle it...}
<A>__{christine yells at schuyler, unable to stand }
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{you fucking psycho, you piece of shit, how could you }
<A>__{schuyler gently lowers his brother and rises, like a zombie now. the big security man picks up his gun and backs away with it, keeping it out of his reach. schuyler backs away from the body, starts to shake, looks as if he really has lost his mind. feingold sobs aloud.}
<C>__{feingold}
<D>__{god, why there was no pointerior it was supposed to be fun...}
<A>__{schuyler looks back and forth from the wounded christine who gasps silent curses, beyond speech to david's body... he slowly turns to the atrium pit directly in front of him. he's strangely calm...}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{fun...}
