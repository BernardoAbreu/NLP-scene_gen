But they never get the chance because... BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKK!!!!!!!! Machine gun fire shatters the windows on both sides of the room, tearing into their bodies before they even get one shot off. Tearing the orchid plants there to shred. Cat watches in mute disbelief, shocked, as her parents bodies are riddled with heavy caliber rounds making them twitch and dance like marionettes on wires. Their blood splattering across the room, across her. And then... Silence. Silence so complete it is deafening in it's absence of any sound. Cat just sits in her chair. And then the door bursts open and four gunmen storm into the room, their assault weapons trained on the only living thing in the room. Cat. Marco enters.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You in the kitchen. You, the bedroom. You, the back.}
<ACTION>__{The gunmen scatter. Marco has his inquisitive eye on Cat, who does not drop her eyes, impossible to read. One of the GUNMAN strides over to Cat, jams a gun to her head. Cat does not move a muscle. Does not blink.}

<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What do you mean so what? You take a kid, teach them, they have value.}

<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Here's twenty asshole. Go do your job.}
<ACTION>__{Scowling, the gunman joins the others in ripping the house apart, looking for something. Marco calmly goes to the fridge, takes out two bottles of water, cracks the caps, sets one down on front of Cat as he sits opposite her. Her hands are in her lap.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(SOFTLY)}
<DIAL>__{Remember me Cataleya?}

<DIAL>__{The Cataleya orchid. His symbol. Your name. That's good. This way you will always remember him.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(BEAT)}
<DIAL>__{I know this is a terrible thing for you to have seen.}
<ACTION>__{All the while his men are searching, frisking the bodies of the dead, even tearing the heels off their shoes.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Some things are too complicated for a kid to understand. This is one of them. But I am going to try explain it and make it very simple for you. So you understand. Now, you know who Don Luis is?}
<ACTION>__{Cat responds, shakes her head yes. Her hand slips imperceptibly under the table.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{CLOSE ON HER HAND}
<ACTION>__{Touches the handle of the knife taped there.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Of course you do. He was your father's best friend since they're kids. He's like an Uncle to you. You know he has always been good to your family, don't you?}
<ACTION>__{Again Cat shakes her head.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This house, the food you eat, the clothes you wear. Even your school fees. All this comes from Don Luis. You know that?}
<ACTION>__{Again Cat shakes her head.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But when someone is good to you and you are not good to them back, then bad things happen. Things like...}
<ACTION>__{He alludes to the riddled bodies of her dead parents.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This.}
<ACTION>__{Cat looks from the bodies and back to Marco, no emotion in her eyes.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know you are a smart girl. You do well in school. So I know this is not too complicated for you to understand. Am I right?}
<ACTION>__{Cat nods.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good. Now, your father had something that belonged to Don Luis. A little thing. No bigger than...}
<ACTION>__{He holds up his thumbnail.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This. Maybe it was in this.}
<ACTION>__{He holds up the frame, shows where the chip was dug out of the wood.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you know what I am talking about?}
<ACTION>__{Cat nods. CLOSE ON CAT'S HAND Gripping the knife handle.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Excellent. Do you know where it is?}
<ACTION>__{Cat nods.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, if you give it to me, Don Luis will be very grateful. And very generous. He will make sure that you are clothed, fed, and sent to the very best school. You will have everything you want.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{But if you don't give it to him, he will be very unhappy. And you see what happens when he is not happy, yes?}
<ACTION>__{Cat nods yes.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So why don't you just give that little thing which belongs to him. Will you do that?}
<ACTION>__{Cat hesitates for a moment, and then removes one hand from underneath the table, her fist closed tight. Marco smiles, kindly. He holds out his hand.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You are a smart girl.}
<ACTION>__{Marco opens his hand.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<ACTION>__{And just as she is about to open her hand...}
<ACTION_ALT>__{CLOSE ON HER OTHER HAND}
<ACTION>__{Under the table, gripping the handle of the knife taped there.}
<CHAR>__{MARCO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Just tell me sweetheart...what do you want?}
<ACTION>__{In a flash, the knife is whipped out and buried into Marco's unsuspecting, open palm. Driven with such force, the knife pierces through the back of his hand, and sticks into the table beneath; pinning his hand. Marco wants to scream but there is so much pain, nothing escapes his throat.}
<CHAR>__{CAT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(in his ear)}
<DIAL>__{To kill Don Luis!}

<ACTION>__{As she runs through the rooms of the house, sprints to the bathroom where one foot hits the toilet, springing her onto the ledge of a very small window. As she looks back, she sees the gunmen in hot pursuit. And she jumps, head first. Barely squeezing her small frame through the tiny window. And she drops... Six feet down, onto a ledge, that is just beneath the window. She flattens against the wall, holding onto the medal of her father.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ON THE BATHROOM}
<ACTION>__{One of the gunman comes to the window, cannot fit through, looks out, does not see anybody across, then hears something beneath him, looks down, sees the tip of a shoe below. Puts his gun out the window, points it down, and.... BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKKK!!!!!! Lets loose with a barrage from his weapon.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ON CAT}
<ACTION>__{She watches as the bullets split the cement all around her feet. Coming inches from ripping into them. And then the barrage stops.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ON THE GUNMAN}
<ACTION>__{His clip runs out. And as he fumbles to slam another one in...}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ON CAT}
<ACTION>__{She hears the pause. Looks out over the sprawl of houses that stretch up and down the steep hillsides of the favela. She looks down at her open palm at the small chip her father gave her. Pops the chip in her mouth, swallows, leaps over the small divide between her house and the next roof, and takes off running.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ON THE GUNMAN}
<ACTION>__{Gets the clip to fit, sees Cat heading off across the roof, out in the open, exposed, vulnerable. He lifts his gun to shoot, when the gun muzzle is slammed up, peppers the ceiling with bullets. The gunman turns to Marco, holding his bloody rag wrapped hand.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{AN OPEN COURTYARD}
<ACTION>__{Where a half dozen women are doing laundry by an open tap. They look up to the sight of this little girl in the blood splattered school uniform, do not say a word. And neither does Cat. She just runs through to a small gate on the far side of the courtyard, opens it, and disappears. One of the women casually hangs one of her wet sheets over the gate, hiding it.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ON THE GUNMEN}
<ACTION>__{They crash through the vegetable garden. The old man deftly kicks a rake leaning against the wall. It falls in between the rows of tomato vines. When the gunmen sprint through, the first one trips over the rake, goes crashing through the vines, which causes the two men behind him to also trip and fall. The fourth man hurdles his fallen cohorts, bounds over the roof. And the fifth man, looks at the old man. Knows what he has done. Shoots him dead before jumping off the roof.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ON CAT}
<ACTION>__{She races down a steep hill in the crowded favela streets.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ON THE GUNMEN}
<ACTION>__{They enter the laundry yard. The women don't even look up. The gunmen look around, just see laundry hanging from the fence, do not see the hidden door. Race back out.}

<ACTION>__{She runs down a steep alley, filled with people sitting outside their homes, chatting, playing dominoes. At the end of the alley, two motorcycles appear. The riders see Cat, as she sees them. They turn their bikes into the alley... VRROOOM! And bear down on Cat. Cat sprints back up the hill. She goes to escape into one of the open doors, but she finds that one after another the doors have closed shut, the people fled inside. The bikes eat up the hill. Cat's legs are no match for them. It seems she will be caught any second. She ducks down a street where laundry is hung on a concealed metal pipe running the length of the alley. As Cat ducks through the sheets the gunmen gun their bikes right towards her, tear through the sheets...}
