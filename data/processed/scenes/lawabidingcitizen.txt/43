<L>__{interior nick's kitchen morning 42}
<A>__{cleaning up the aftermath of the party: nick up on a step stool taking down the birthday banner; kell in her robe feeding the dishwasher; emma zooming in and out shuttling paper plates and plastic cups into a big trash bag...}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{...and while we were singing karaoke, ashley was all dancing around and jumping up and down and suddenly she gets this look on her face...}
<C>__{kell}
<D>__{i saw it coming.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{...and suddenly she just went barf. total puke moment. and we were all like, ewwww gross! it was so funny...}
<A>__{she's out of the kitchen to grab more stuff. kell starts preparing a bowl of cereal for emma.}

<C>__{emma}
<P>__{(grabs her cereal)}
