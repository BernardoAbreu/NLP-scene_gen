<A>__{lenny slumps in the back seat.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{you're some piece of work, you know that. just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. i mean, between vice and this so called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{what i'm saying. but you still come out this goofball romantic.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{it is my sword and my shield, macey.}
<A>__{lenny finds the anonymous tape in his pocket. he looks a it, puzzled.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{what's that? present from faith?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{no idea.}
<A>__{he opens his briefcase, pops the tape into the deck, puts the squid rig on and closes his eyes. maybe he can forget about faith a minute. he punches play. pov sequence: the first thing we notice is that the pov is distorted visually. the colors are de saturated. almost black and white. yet the detail is crisp and clear, almost hyper real. we are walking down a windowless hallway at a large hotel. an apparently endless row of doors. the wearer's glance goes to the numbers on the doors from time to time. we come to a particular door. there is a do not disturb sign on the door. the wearer moves to the room next door. looks both ways. the corridor is empty.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{it's a test pattern so far.}
<A>__{"our" hands appear, quickly pulling on latex surgical gloves. they look like male hands. the snapping of the rubber is the only sound in the corridor. the pov hunches down to the lock and we see the hands go to work with lock picking tools. several seconds and the lock is very professionally picked.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{alright, a little b&e action.}
<A>__{we enter the dark room, which is vacant. the drapes are open and we see city lights. it is night. one gloved hand picks up the guest directory and looks at it in the moonlight coming in the window: the sunset sheraton. the wearer drops the directory and the hands reappear holding... a black ski mask. he pulls it on, leaving the subsequent pov seen through the eye holes of the mask. the wearer now looks into a mirror on the dresser. he has avoided his reflection up until now. we see a man, dressed in a jogging suit and black fanny pack, and of course the ski mask. totally anonymous.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{hey, getting good. solid suspense build.}
<A>__{the wearer crosses to the balcony door. opens it quietly and goes outside, moving to the wall dividing this room's balcony from the one next door. the wearer climbs the railing and, six stories above the pavement, slips around the wall, stepping down onto the other balcony. we hug the wall, looking furtively into the room. it is a suite. in the living room we see a woman making herself a drink at the mini bar. she turns... it is iris. she is wearing a t shirt and panties. probably ready for bed. she looks like she can't sleep. pours the scotch shakily.}
