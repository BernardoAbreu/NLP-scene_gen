<A>__{kara opens the closet and switches on the light. satisfying danny that it's empty, she breaks into her perfunctory routine.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{stay away monters, stay away ghouls. stay away from danny. you jerks know the rules.}
<P>__{(crossing to danny's bed)}
<D>__{better?}
<A>__{danny giggles as his pretty young mother tucks him in.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{mommy, when can we go home?}
<A>__{kara sighs. they've been through this one before.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{home is here in grandma and grandpa's new house. at least while i'm in college. remember our deal.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{the kids at school said this is a haunted house that a bad man used to live here.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{they did, did they? since when did we start listening to the kids at school?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{but i've seen him!}

<A>__{danny is afraid to tell her.}
<C>__{kara}

<D>__{no, mom keep it on!}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{okay ... but just for tonight.}
<A>__{kara adjusts the closet door, causing one of danny's school drawings to fly off the wall. she picks it up on her way out.}
<C>__{kara}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{good night, danny.}
<A>__{kara softly closes the door. danny lies awake, blankets drawn up to his chin, eyes wide. still very much afraid.}
