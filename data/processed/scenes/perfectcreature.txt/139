<A>__{lilly moves through the derelict place, past fallen beams. it seems empty. then lilly hears it again. a wail. this time she knows what it is; we can tell from the way her eyes glisten. she moves forward, closer to the sound. and finally she sees the brother priest we saw before, who kneels in front of a crate. he looks up at her as she approaches. as lilly moves forward she sees what lies with the crate. wrapped in dirty sacking, there is a baby. in the corner lilly can see a woman the child's mother dead from the infection. the baby cries and lilly can see the tiny fangs of a brother in the baby's mouth.}

<A>__{lilly moves forward. emotional music rises in the soundtrack; evoking memory, the circle completing. lilly reaches out, letting the baby girl grip her hand. lilly reaches into the crate, drawing the baby into her arms, staring down into the baby's face; a face somehow already wise, already serene. broken tears run down lilly's cheek as she presses the baby to herself, all the pain of the past flooding over her, the baby's tiny hands reaching out, clasping onto her.}
