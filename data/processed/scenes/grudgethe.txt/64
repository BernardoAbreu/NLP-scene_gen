<A>__{susan takes a breath and sits down, trying to relax. it's obvious that she feels safer, here in the security room. then she notices movement on one of the security monitors on the screen: the guard continues down the 10th floor hall, stopping at the door to the stairwell. susan leans toward the monitor for a better view. on the screen: the guard opens the stairwell door and leans inside, checking it out. on susan: her eyes are glued to the screen. waiting. on the screen: the guard, finding nothing out of the ordinary, closes the door and continues on down the hall. susan leans back, exhaling. relieved. then the video crackles with a sudden quick burst of static. and susan gasps, sitting upright, as she sees on the screen: the stairwell door opens again. and then something dark moves out of the stairwell, entering the hallway. on susan: she recoils from the screen in horror, unable to tear her gaze away. her mouth opens in a silent scream, her eyes widening as she watches and then she finds the strength to get to her feet.}
