<A>__{harry adds throttle and works the footpedals, using the tail rotor to steer. the chopper had snow skids, and harry is skiing the damn thing down the mountain. the copter is burning as it rockets down the slope on its skids. bullets are hitting the fuselage, and everything around it. skiers are wiping out, hitting trees. a snowmobile hits a rock and flies spectacularly into a ravine.}
