<L>__{exterior street next day}
<A>__{sharon and robby are rolling to a stop in a strip mall parking lot, exiting their car. no rush. she's still very downbeat. as they walk from the car, he keeps glancing at her, concerned for her.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{pogo...?}
<A>__{she puts up a hand to brush all the words away. she can't talk about it. she pushes through it by doing the work.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{which store is it?}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{the little market there. they came through a back window last night. mostly vandalism...}
<A>__{they walk on, but as sharon reaches the sidewalk, a little child, three years old or so, toddles out the door of a shop. a skateboarder is rattling along, and sharon makes a grab for the child, taking his arm gently...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{whoa...}
<A>__{... and pulling him to safety as the skateboarder passes by shouting...}
<C>__{skater}
<D>__{sorry!}
<A>__{and now the worried mother is emerging from the shop...}
<C>__{worried mother}
<D>__{oh, god, thank you. billy!}
<A>__{she picks up her boy, walks back into the shop. sharon stands there as it all blooms inside of her, rocks her, really, this little act, evoking catch, who he is, what he said and what he means to her. robby is a few steps ahead, waiting for her, but she can't move yet, looking around her now at the people walking among the shops and cafes. she picks one. she catches the eyes. she gives a brief smile. the smile is answered, shyly, kindly, the person moves on.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{pogo?}
<A>__{she doesn't move for a moment. then she turns to robby.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{there's something i have to do. i need an address and phone.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{what's the name?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{elanora chu.}
<A>__{robby looks at her, then nods, giving her this.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{let's do it.}
<A>__{they walk back to the car.}
