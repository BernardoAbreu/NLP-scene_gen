<A>__{coll sits on the landing, smoking a cigarette. by luciano's front door the first bodyguard sleeps soundly in the folding chair. the second bodyguard moves from one wall to the other, looking for a comfortable stance, crazy with boredom.}

<A>__{the second bodyguard stands with his shoulder against the wall, facing toward the apartment door, filing his nails. the first bodyguard still sleeps by the door. close on the second bodyguard as he digs under one of his nails with the file, intent on the job. a shadow looms. a hand clasps over his mouth from behind. his body goes rigid. the tip of a knife bursts from under his larynx. as he struggles, the knife rotates 180 degrees in his neck. blood gurgles out of his mouth as his eyes roll back in his head. he slides along the wall to the floor.}
<B>__{mad dog coll}
<A>__{stoops to wipe his bloody hands on the dead man's tuxedo. close on the face of the first bodyguard who seems to stir awake, then doze off again, then finally rouse himself to consciousness. as his eyes blink open, a knife comes crashing into the top of his skull, freezing his bemused expression for eternity. he slumps over in his chair, the knife still planted in his head. coll fishes the keys to the apartment from the man's pocket.}
