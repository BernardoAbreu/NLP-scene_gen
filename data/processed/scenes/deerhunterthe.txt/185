<A>__{nick leans on a railing watching the black, interchangeable cars of a coal train roll slowly by. sal sits with the suitcase of money in his lap, utterly bewildered, crying.}
<C>__{sal}

<A>__{nick looks at sal. his head is spinning and he brings himself back with effort.}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{but, nick... hey, i mean, where would a guy like merle get money like this?}
<A>__{nick is standing slightly behind sal, looking down at the money. the reality of what merle is doing, has nearly overwhelmed him and it is only with tremendous effort that he maintains a casual tone.}

<D>__{oh cards, maybe. poker... it's getting cold, sal. i'm going to take you in.}
<P>__{(starts off)}

<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(starts off again)}
<D>__{well... phantom mary's on my mother's side. naturally no one there admits it because phantom mary's pretty weird... you want to hear the whole story?}
<C>__{sal}
<P>__{(enthusiastically)}
<D>__{yeah!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{like i say, phantom mary's pretty weird... lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called pajamas and a cow called fred. well, last week i got a call from phantom mary, which in itself was very strange...}
