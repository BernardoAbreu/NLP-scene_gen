<L>__{exterior zoo grounds on balloon moving}
<A>__{they rise to an altitude of ten or twelve feet. but o.d. stu's additional weight pulls the balloon back down and both of them hit the ground! they have to run at top speed just to keep pace with the balloon!}
<D>__{stu bone let...go...you...dingleberry...}
<A>__{as he's trying to kick o.d. stu off the rope, a gust of wind catches the balloon and lifts it high into the air. for about three seconds. the boys tumble to earth, off balance, in a heap, bouncing along the pavement. the balloon pulls them over a wrought iron fence and drags them through the alligator pit. giant jaws snap as the boys glide overhead like bait on a hook. as the balloon lifts up again, o.d. stu hauls himself along the length of the rope. he gets close enough to grab stu bone's leg. stu bone reaches down to push him away...grabs a fistful of duct tape... ...and rip! the tape tears exposing the great big gash in o.d. stu's midsection! he tries to pull himself together...}
