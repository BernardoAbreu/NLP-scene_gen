<D>__{mr. i raymond. "ray" to his friends, and, more importantly, to his neighbors. the guy who up until about six weeks ago lived upstairs. i knew it was him the moment i saw the letter. i start to remember things now: his stupid clothing, his music latin, bulgarian, whatever fucking world music was trendy that week stupid laugh, awful cooking smells. i can't remember anything good about him at all. i never liked him much then, and i fucking hate him now... i manage to block out the worst, most painful, most disturbing memory of him until i go to bed.}
