<L>__{exterior castle balcony day}
<A>__{robin grabs marian, pulling her back. carefully lifts her face. her lifeless eyes suddenly flash. she lashes out. a spitfire.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{let me go! who are you?}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(restraining her)}
<D>__{i'm your sworn protector. any way i see fit.}
<L>__{exterior city square day}
<A>__{robin emerges from the castle. draped over his shoulder, marian is kicking and beating at him. he reaches the fountain in the center of the square and tosses her into the freezing water. she leaps to her feet, yelling. slips and tumbles back. water streams from her bridal gown. a crowd gathers, enjoying the show.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{robin? oh god, is that you?}
<A>__{she stumbles out of the fountain... and storms at him, pounding her fists on his chest.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{how dare you?!}
<A>__{robin grins at the crowd.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i think she's feeling better.}
<A>__{marian looks about her... the chaotic aftermath of battle. reality gradually sinks in. she folds against robin's chest. little john arrives, his huge arms enfolding wulf and fanny.}
<C>__{little john}
<D>__{we done it, mate. we clobbered the buggers.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{are you 'urt?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{it will mend.}
<A>__{he spots a group kneeling beside the fallen body of aslan. his smile fades. he runs over. cradles aslan's head.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{aslan, my friend.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{i'm going home the easy way, robin.}
<C>__{friar}
<P>__{(shaking aslan)}
<D>__{you die on me, you son of satan, and i swear i will bury you as a christian in st. catherine's cathedral with a thousand monks chanting prayers for your miserable soul. you hear me?}
<C>__{aslan}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{i have no strength, brother tuck.}
<C>__{friar}
<P>__{(kicking him)}
<D>__{a fine friend you are! by the grace of allah and jehovah we have won the day, and you want to give up the ghost. i will pickle your remains in mead, lay you in your grave with a pig for a companion, and mark it with a cross as big as this castle.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{please! it hurts when i laugh.}
<C>__{friar}
<D>__{see. there's life in the heathen dog yet.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{here, tuck. look after him. you deserve each other.}
<A>__{robin stands, marian joins him. around them cheering grows, till the whole crowd is in unison.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{robin hood! robin hood!}
