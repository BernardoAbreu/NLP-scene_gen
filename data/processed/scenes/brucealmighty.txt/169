<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior city park day}
<A>__{a big blood drive in progre ss. everyone is there, grace, sam, debbie and zoe, ginnie and jack, the kowolski brothers, momma kowolski, evan, susan , dallas, fred. bobby serves various food items from his cart.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you know, french toast was invented by tavern owner, joseph french, who had a poor knowledge of grammar, and did not know how to use the possessive apostrophe, so he called it french toast instead of french's toast...}
<A>__{pull back to reveal bruce, crutch under one arm, cast on his leg, mic in hand, reporting. he's now talking in his own voice, much more himself.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{this is bruce nolan at buffalo's first annual "be the miracle" blood drive. remember, the life you save may be mine, so hurry down. i had a close call and, well, can you imagine what life would have been like without me?}
<A>__{laughs in the background, from the people that know bruce. bruce walks over to the kowolski brothers.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{in honor of this event, the kowolski brothers have baked a one of a kind, creation.}
<A>__{the brothers proudly unveil the special cookie and we see that it's a huge syringe shaped chocolate chip cookie.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{sure, a little creepy and a shameless plug, but we love 'em.}
<P>__{(bruce breaks off a little piece, takes a bite)}
<D>__{mmm, good needle. remember, that's kowolski's bakery. the bakery that gets more air time than a high speed chase.}
<A>__{everyone laughs. the kowolski brothers beam. bruce takes a seat as a volunteer nurse pulls up his sleeve, revealing the prayer beads worn around his wrist. she ties off his arm, starts to probe for a vein.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{to be honest, i've never been a big fan of shots. . .}
<A>__{the volunteer now is swabbing bruce's arm and bruce is starting to sweat.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{okay, we're good to go...they just stick it into my arm. breaking through the skin, of course...}
<A>__{the volunteer pulls out the needle and bruce passes out cold. gasps, the nurse leans close, total silence, then:}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{blllaaaa!}
<A>__{bruce jolts awake making the nurse and several people jump. they all laugh.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{had you going, didn't iiiiii1}
<A>__{he reacts to the nurse poking the needle in. everyone laughs more.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{no, this is nothing. in fact, this is the second time i've given blood this week. for those of you who haven't heard, i ' d like you to meet the soon to be mrs. exclusive.}
<A>__{he throws a look to grace who smiles in return. the crowd applauds.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{this is bruce nolan reporting for eyewitness news.}
<A>__{the camera cuts. bruce lowers his mic, turns to grace.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{so, what'd you think?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i don't know, i thought it was very pleasurable.}
<A>__{bruce smiles, they kiss... as the blood drive continues, we push through the crowd, heading somewhere. bodies clear frame and we see the homeless man sitting on a park bench. his sign reads:}
<B>__{thee end}
<A>__{the homeless man smiles into camera. we continue forward and in a slow, mysterious, subtle fashion his face slowly transforms into the very pleased, face of god, who winks and w. . . e}
