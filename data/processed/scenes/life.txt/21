<L>__{exterior juke joint night}
<A>__{ray dashes into the street, glancing both ways. no sign of winston. damn.}
<L>__{exterior back alley night}
<A>__{winston produces ray's pocket watch and pops it open. a smile crosses his face as the mechanical tune plays. a sheriff's sedan rounds a corner, illuminating winston in its headlights. the car pulls up and sheriff warren pike steps out. distinguished by a casual cruelness, he's a young white man who loves his uniform.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{if it isn't winston hancock.}
<A>__{winston tries to move past pike, but the sheriff blocks his path with a night stick. as winston backs off, another squad car pulls up behind him. two deputies step from the car, guns drawn.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i thought we agreed that you were gonna leave town.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{i tried to leave, sheriff pike. but your wife begged me to stay.}
<A>__{pike slams winston with his club, sending the black man to his knees. as winston struggles back to his feet, a stiletto flashes and he lunges for the sheriff, slashing his cheek. the deputies grab winston from behind, holding him by both arms. the long knife clatters to ground. pike touches his face, examining the blood on his fingers.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{you just committed suicide, boy.}
