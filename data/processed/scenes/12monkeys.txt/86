<D>__{hey, nice ta see ya. lookin' good! hi, there. yes, it has been a long time.}
<A>__{in the b.g., too far away to hear them, agent #4 trails jeffrey and cole as they maneuver through the guests toward the grand staircase.}

<P>__{(whispers to cole)}
<D>__{county hospital, right? 1989. the "immaculate escape" am i right?}

<P>__{(whispers to cole)}
<D>__{who chattered? goines? weller?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all! for the future!}
<A>__{jeffrey studies cole. cole doesn't just talk crazy. he looks crazy!}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{come on, follow me. you don't lock so good.}
<A>__{jeffrey starts guiding cole up the grand staircase as cole, glancing back, spots agent #3 and agent #4, both keeping an eye on him now.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i don't have time to go upstairs. the police are looking for me. i need to know where it is and exactly what it is.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<P>__{(brightening suddenly)}
<D>__{i get it! this is your old plan, right?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{plan? what are you talking about?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{remember? we were in the dayroom, watching tv, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. and you said to me, "wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?" you do remember that, don't you?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{bulishit! you're fucking with my head!}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{and that's when i told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(grabbing jeffrey)}
<D>__{listen, you dumb fuck! the thing mutates we live underground! the world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats. we're like moles or worms. all we want to do is study the original... agent #4's voice okay take it easy. we know who you are, mr. cole.}
<A>__{cole feels a firm grip on his shoulder, turns and sees agert #4}
<D>__{agent #4 let's go somewhere and talk this thing over. okay? just come with me...}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{you're right! absolutely right. me's a nut case, totally deranged. delusional! paranoid. his processor's all fucked up, his information tray is jammed.}
<A>__{agent #4 is wishing jeffrey would chill out even as the third agent is climbing up the staircase to help. cole is like a trapped animal. he's being led down the staircase now with jeffrey, right on his heels, yelling so everyone can hear.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{you know what it is, the "army of the twelve monkeys"? it's a collection of nature kooks who run a store downtown. space case do gooders saving rain forests. i have nothing to do with those bozos anymore. i quit being the rich kid fall guy for a bunch of ineffectual bananas. so much for your grand plot!}
<A>__{cole stares back at jeffrey as both agents hustle cole down the stairs. it sounds true! jeffrey's so confident.}
<D>__{agent #3 take it easy, mr. mason, we've got him. everything's...}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{my father has been warning people about the dangers of experimentation with viruses and dna for years. you've "processed" that information through your addled paranoid infra structure and lo and behold, i'm frankenstein and the "army of the twelve monkeys" becomes some sort of sinister revolutionary cabal. this man is totally batshit! you know where he thinks he comes from???}
<A>__{suddenly, cole, catching the agents by surprise, wrenches free, shoves them aside, and stumbles down the rest of the staircase.}
