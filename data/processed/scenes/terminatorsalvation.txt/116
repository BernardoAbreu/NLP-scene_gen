<L>__{exterior coastal valley day}
<A>__{ a panoramic view of a gorgeous coastal community. the place is lush, green, with well maintained, lovely homes in the distance, a blue sea beyond. the complex of buildings stands a few miles away, at the far end of the valley. marcus, amazed, limps down a gentle slope leading to this seeming paradise.}
<L>__{exterior golf course day}
<A>__{marcus emerges from a small stand of trees and finds himself looking at a groomed fairway. marcus hears a noise nearby a golf ball bouncing on the ground not far away. marcus turns in the direction it came from. an electric golf cart approaches, driven by a handsome, middle aged golfer jeremy who wears casual country club attire, eating from a clear bag of trail mix. jeremy comes to a stop beside marcus.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<A>__{marcus slowly shakes his head, as jeremy climbs out of the cart, looking him over carefully, taking in the exposed metal at his shoulder and leg.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{what the hell is this?}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{you look like you've been hit by a truck }
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{among other things. look, i'm trying to find some friends a couple of kids. they were taken here, i saw some buildings }
<A>__{jeremy eyes him, a little surprised at his ignorance.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{the facility, sure. hop in, i will take you there.}
<A>__{marcus hesitates a beat, can he trust this guy? but jeremy simply seems eager to help, as he guides him to the passenger seat, then gets behind the wheel. with a smile:}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{this round was gonna blow my handicap anyway. i'm jeremy.}
<A>__{he extends a hand. after a beat, marcus reaches toward it }
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{marcus.}
<A>__{jeremy clutches marcus' hand tightly. marcus blinks, jeremy cocks his head, then lets go.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{i can't connect with you at all... your interface must've been damaged. don't worry, soon they'll have you as good as new.}
<A>__{with that, he hits the gas.}
