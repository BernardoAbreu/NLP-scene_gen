<C>__{jasmine}
<D>__{trevor what is it? phone the police!}
<A>__{three heavyset men in balaclava's charge into the front room. jasmine screams, dropping the camera on its side yet still giving a viewpoint on events. three men are on trevor, he's receiving a serious beating.}
<B>__{the music on the sound track begins to get louder.}
<A>__{a man grabs jasmine by the hair and drags her to the middle of the room, she attempts to fight back, feisty as ever. this is bedlam. suddenly someone rushes in from the left and lays a vicious right hook to trevor's head. he goes down like a lead weight. jasmine's crying, fear washing over her. a child cries out from upstairs.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{tell that fucking slag to stop crying... now!!}
<A>__{two hooded men drag jasmine off to another room. she's fighting back clawing at them. trevor's face is pressed against the cold lino flooring. someone has grabbed the camera and angles it on trevor's bloodied features. congealed blood envelopes his eyes and nose cavities. a hand moves into shot and grabs hold of his face, squeezing his cheeks so he looks sadly comic. trevor's eyes flicker open.}
<D>__{voice (os) (cont'd) look into the lens...}
<A>__{trevor fails to comply. the hand slaps him hard and grabs his face again.}
<D>__{voice (os) (cont'd) look into the fucking lens!!!}

<A>__{trevor begins to weep a painful sight.}

<A>__{the voice echoes out.}
