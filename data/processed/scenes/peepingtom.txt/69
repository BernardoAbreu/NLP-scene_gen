<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{you've what?...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{put the...}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{then they'll know someone's here.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{they won't come in.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{they'll wait outside... what's the difference?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{the difference is... a perfect film...}
<A>__{over his shoulder we see the studio camera.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{... have waited... a long time... for this... and so have you ... no one... must interrupt it.}
<A>__{she glances round at the brazenly burning lights; shakes her head despairingly.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{we'll be caught.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what does that matter?}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{matter!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you stand to lose... a job as an extra... i stand to lose... nothing.}
<A>__{she looks at him in silence.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{...the results must be so perfect... that the risks don't count...}
<A>__{close shot of mark.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{so perfect... that even he ...}
<P>__{(he hesitates)}
<D>__{... even he... would say...}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{who don jarvis!?}
<A>__{he looks at her, then nods.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{oh! he'd say:}
<P>__{(imitating the great man's voice)}
<D>__{sign on the dotted line, kiddies! you can use my pen, but bring your own ink!}
<P>__{(her excitement is growing)}
<D>__{mark... if you're sure it's worth it?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it's time to find out, viv...}
<A>__{he walks slowly towards the studio camera. she prepares for the test by switching on music and warming up with dance movements.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{come on! get hot!}
<P>__{(she accents the rhythm)}
<A>__{mark puts the cine camera and the black cloth bag on the dolly, slowly mounts the platform, closes the blimp and swings the camera. we watch him from the top of the studio, from the door of the studio, from the director's chair. and finally we watch him from vivian's pov. she stops dancing but the music continues.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you belong there...}
<A>__{he stares ahead of him, his mind far, far away... then bends and looks into the finder. there is a single harsh chord of music and the screen goes dark. it remains dark for a moment. suddenly the darkness parts like curtains and in the centre we see vivian's face in the finder of the studio camera. (unlike the ground glass of the newsagent's camera, we see everything the right way up and in perfect perspective.) mark hooks a filler light below the camera and switches it on. he adjusts the finder until he has made of vivian's delicate features a radiant miniature. the miniature smiles shyly at him. she has stopped dancing and is looking directly at the camera. music continues.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{i do feel alone in front of it...}
<P>__{(she hesitates)}
<D>__{i suppose stars never do?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{they feel alone without it...}
<P>__{(he looks in the eyepiece)}
<A>__{through the film, we can see only her eyes large and wistful.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{... and the great ones... feel alone... all the time...}
<A>__{she becomes the uninhibited vivian again.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{then i'm great, boy! what is it you want me to act?}
<P>__{(she strikes an}
<D>__{attitude a, la}
<P>__{rabbins)}
<A>__{he looks up from the camera; she smiles and starts keeping time to the rhythm again.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{being frightened to death?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you remembered?}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{yes and i will have a go!}
<A>__{we hear his quick breathing.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{i've been wondering all the afternoon how you'd do it! i will bet you've thought of a wonderful twist!}
<P>__{(she does a wonderful twist)}
<A>__{close shot of mark. he looks down a little sadly and peers into the finder. (the camera dolly is on tracks he tracks forward.) music continues piano. in the finder we see a large trunk 'at greatly reduced prices' on the shelf behind vivian. from vivian's pov we see mark leave the studio camera and hurry towards the trunks. she watches him wide eyed.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{building us a set.}
<A>__{he reaches for the largest trunk.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{why not pull the studio down while you're about it? they can only hang you once.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{exactly.}
<A>__{he carries the trunk towards the studio camera, and lays it carefully on the floor. music continues. vivian peers into the front glass of the studio camera as if it were a mirror. the rhythm of the music changes.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{if only don jarvis could see me now!}
<A>__{she jumps onto the trunk and taps.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{if only i could see don jarvis now!}
<A>__{she giggles again.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{i warn you, mark i'm hysterical... i'd rather act dying of laughter, if it's all the same to you...}
<A>__{she jumps off the trunk onto the floor. he opens the trunk. she jumps into it. her laughter echoes round the deserted studio.}
