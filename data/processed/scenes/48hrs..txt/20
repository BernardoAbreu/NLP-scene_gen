<T>__{transition:}
<B>__{squad room day}
<A>__{cates walks in. several detectives gather around him.}
<C>__{fat cop}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{read the report.}
<C>__{old cop}
<D>__{two cops blown away by a credit card booster... that don't figure.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{no shit.}
<C>__{fat cop}
<D>__{they were good cops.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{they were good cops who fucked up and got careless.}
<A>__{a snotty young cop paces.}
<C>__{young cop}
<D>__{that's what you say, cates...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{young cop}
<D>__{but that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{the truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?}
<A>__{cates looks at the old cop.}
<C>__{old cop}
<D>__{it don't figure.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i need to borrow a piece.}
<A>__{the old cop shrugs... looks in his desk...}
<C>__{young cop}
<D>__{somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{are you gonna tell me about police procedure? do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.}
<C>__{young cop}
<D>__{i guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...}
<A>__{cates loses it for a second, lands on him with both hands, pushes him against a wall... the room goes quiet. cates cools down.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{just shut the fuck up.}
<A>__{the other cops don't intervene. they just watch. cates cools down, straightens up. haden walks by, or, rather, speeds by.}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{cates, i will need to see you in five minutes, exactly five.}
<A>__{the old cop hands cates a gun, a traditional army .45...}
<C>__{old cop}
<D>__{best i can do.}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{d'you read me, cates...}
<A>__{haden continues moving away.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{five minutes. i heard you, your voice carries...}
<A>__{as cates is examining the gun, ruth, a lab technician, enters and drops three 8 x 10's on the desk near cates.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{they're still wet.}
<A>__{cates lifts the blow ups, each one showing a different aspect of a spent bullet.}
<C>__{ruth}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{lots of people getting shot with .44's lately ... last year, it was saturday night specials..now it's heavy stuff. people must be getting madder about something.}
<A>__{cates starts pinning the blow ups onto a large bulletin board on the wall. nearby, at the same time (within cates' line of sight, within earshot), lisa, the hooker, is being interrogated by a police woman who pulls the statement off the typewriter. nearby, the indian hooker is being interrogated in spanish.}
<C>__{policewoman}
<D>__{you're an accessory to murder one, so you're going to have to do a whole lot better than what we got down here, honey...}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{gimme a break, huh? ... look, i got there. he was a trick just like any other for all i knew. that's all there is. he didn't feel like sitting and talking. he was in a big hurry to get laid. i was with him about an hour...}
<A>__{cates has gotten interested in the last part of this ... drifts toward her... a detective comes through, begins distributing i.b.m. printouts to cates, the other nearby officers..}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{we got a print from the hotel room. guy's real name is ganz, albert ganz. a hitter from back east but he worked out here a few years back. armed robbery. broke out of prison two days ago and capped two of the guards. a real animal. wait'll you see this...}
<A>__{cates reads the printout, then smoothly,imperiously, he takes over the questioning of lisa.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{did he give you a return match?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{he wasn't interested.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{maybe he didn't like your performance.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i will take a raincheck...}
<A>__{from the side, ruth is pointing at the photos...}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{this'll interest you, jack...we've got something here from your gun... and these are from the first weapon ganz used...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{here.}
<C>__{cates}
<A>__{she turns, produces the third photo. pins it beside the one from the walden hotel.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{a perfect match for the markings from the first gun he used... but not from the walden hotel... fired at least six hours earlier...at point blank range... right between the eyes. found him on a park bench...}
<A>__{she shows him two more pictures. police forensics shots of henry wong ... very dead on the park bench...}
<C>__{ruth}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ya know, there are some very bad people out there in the world.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{look at it this way, ruth. if there weren't, what would there be for us to do?}
<A>__{lisa continues with the policewoman.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{anyway... so i got there and took him down. he started watching television and then you sensational people started banging on the door... that's all... except ... he's gonna give you guys a hard time.}
<C>__{cates}
<A>__{cates looks up as he hears that remark. notices kehoe, another detective, entering with a long suitcase.}
<C>__{policewoman}
<D>__{what makes you think so?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i think he liked shooting cops a lot more than getting laid.}
<A>__{cates watches kehoe unpack the box.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{is that what this guy ganz had in the hotel?}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{every last bit of it. the big guy's room was empty.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i will help you out.}
<A>__{cates and kehoe start going through the suitcase. kehoe produces a speed loader for a .44...}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{this guy must have had a .44 like yours, jack. now he's got yours.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{kehoe next produces several boxes of shells.}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{this cat was real serious about his artillery.}
<A>__{an attendant comes through, hands kehoe a file. he opens it, shows the file to cates who reads the name under the mug shot.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{billy bear...}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{backup man from the east bay. worked with ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.}
<A>__{kehoe opens the second file. four mug shots are inside.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{who are all these?}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{they all pulled a bunch of jobs with ganz about four years ago.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{uhh ... wong, henry wong. he was in on the same job.}
<A>__{cates spins the file around so that both ruth an kehoe can see it, throws the forensic shots down beside it.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{tell me that's not the same guy.}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{hey ... dick tracy.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{did ganz have a grudge against his old friends?}
<A>__{haden comes out of his office.}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{get in here, cates.}
<A>__{cates ignores him.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i think i wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking. can we find them?}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{here's the file. cates checks the file.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{one of em's in the slam.}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{damn you, cates ... get in here.}
<A>__{cates walks into haden's cubicle.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i want to be left alone on this one. algren was killed with my gun.}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{yeah, i read the report...}
<A>__{haden shuffles some papers, seems to ignore cates.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{hey, the bastard's got my gun. i want it back.}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... in other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... i know, we all know the truth's a little different.}
<A>__{cates almost smiles at haden.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{yeah. it bothers me when cops get hurt while i'm makin' a play. i don't like it.}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{you might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, jack.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... besides, i got a lead...}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{okay. you're not a team player. you gotta do things your own way. fine. nail this guy and make us all look good. but you better watch your ass. if you screw up, i can promise you, you're goin' down.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{you really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. he starts to go.}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{jack?}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{try not to get your ass shot to pieces. we got enough dead cops on this one.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i will keep it in mind.}
<A>__{leaves.}
