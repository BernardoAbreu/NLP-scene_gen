<L>__{interior another house in baalbek day}
<A>__{the sheikh, wearing a fresh white robe and skull cap, comes into the room...}
<C>__{the sheikh}
<D>__{i am very pleased to receive you as my guest, mr. wallace.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{thank you for having us...}
<A>__{reverse: norman's camera crew is setting up. mike wallace is there. a dangerous combination of intelligence, arrogance, and celebrity, there's a kinetic quality about him. wallace sits across from the sheikh on a dais of patterned linoleum in incongruous armchairs against a wallpaper mural of a french formal garden. a sound technician wires the sheikh and mike with microphones. norman says something to lowell and then goes out.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i think i've got a problem with the gennie. i have to go outside.}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(going outside)}
<D>__{norman...?}
<A>__{mike turns his chair to face and slides it closer to the sheikh's chair. the head bodyguard barks something in arabic. the interpreter says something back in arabic. the sheikh, absorbed in his notes for the upcoming interview, ignores all of this.}
<C>__{interpreter}
<D>__{he says you must not sit so close.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(re: bodyguard)}
<D>__{i can't conduct an interview from back there.}
<A>__{the bodyguard, bristling at wallace's tone, barks more confrontational arabic.}
<C>__{interpreter}
<D>__{you must move back your chair.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{will you tell him that when i conduct an interview, i sit anywhere i damn please!}
<C>__{interpreter}
<D>__{there is no interview.}
<A>__{as mike leaps forward, moving inches from the bodyguard's face with such sudden ferocity, even the bodyguard flinches.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{you! i'm talking to you!}
<A>__{more armed men start to enter.}
<C>__{mike wallace }
<D>__{what the hell do you think i am? a 78 year old assassin? you think i'm gonna karate him to death with this notepad?}
<P>__{(to interpreter)}
<D>__{are you interpreting what i'm saying?}
<C>__{interpreter}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{we're there.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{good, well ask him if arabic is his second language.}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(to interpreter)}
<D>__{don't interpret that!}
<P>__{(to both)}
<D>__{hold it. hold it. hold it! slow, slow !!}
<P>__{(to the sheikh)}
<D>__{sheikh, do you mind...if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face mr. wallace?}
<A>__{the sheikh looks up from his notes, nods, fixes his chair, goes back to his notes...}
<C>__{lowell }
<D>__{is that okay?}
<C>__{interpreter}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(bodyguard assents; to mike)}
<D>__{are you ready? or you want to keep fucking around and warm up some more...?}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(wry)}
<D>__{...that's got my heart started.}
<A>__{they know each other well. lowell smiles. wallace sits down.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{alright, todd, give me the three button on mike, please. okay. we are rolling. okay, mike.}
<A>__{they roll camera... "60 minutes"... "hezbollah"...}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<P>__{(charming)}
<D>__{sheikh fadlallah, thank you so much}
<A>__{for}
<D>__{seeing us.}
<P>__{(changes)}
<D>__{are you a terrorist?}
<A>__{the sheikh didn't expect the mike wallace opening shot between the eyes. he recovers...}
<C>__{the sheikh}
<D>__{mr. wallace, i...am a servant of god.}
<A>__{that expression of incredulity...}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{a servant of god? really...}
<A>__{mike, tipping his glasses down while the hostile gunmen, cradling weapons, watch him through the doorway...}
<C>__{mike wallace }
<D>__{americans believe that you , as an islamic fundamentalist, that you}
<A>__{are a leader who}
<D>__{contributed to the bombing of the u.s. embassy.}
<A>__{the ballsiness of wallace, asking these questions in this place, is impressive...}
