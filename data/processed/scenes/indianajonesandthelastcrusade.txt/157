<T>__{cut to brody and sallah :}
<A>__{who attend to henry awaiting indy's return. indy and elsa come forward with the grail. the two nazi soldiers are over awed by the possessors of the grail. they put down their guns and kneel. indy kneels by henry's side and tilts his head forward and holds the grail to his lips. henry is too weak to even open his eyes. henry swallows some of the water. much of it runs down the corners of his mouth. finally indy pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. the color returns to henry's face. henry's eyes open. the first thing he sees is the grail and they light up. then they shift to indy's faceand they light up even more...}

<D>__{it's ours, indy. yours and mine.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{elsa, don't cross the seal. the knight warned us not to take the grail from here.}
<A>__{a rumbling sound is heard and the ground roars and shifts. dirt falls from the ceiling of the cavern. elsa falls on the great seal. the grail bounces away from her grasp. she reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to split open. elsa slips into the crevasse. she screams. elsa is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the grail almost within her reach. as her hands lose their grip, indy just manages to one of them, he himself sliding forward across the slanted floor.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{junior! junior!}
<A>__{with her free hand, elsa is trying to get the grail. indy can't save her unless she gives him her free hand. she has to choose.}

<D>__{elsa! give me your hand. give me your other hand!}
<A>__{elsa just manages to touch the grail. in doing so, she has tipped the balance too farindy slides down another yard, elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to her death.}
<C>__{indy}

<D>__{elsa!!}
<A>__{now the ledge indy lies upon begins to break apart. henry grabs one of his hands as indy struggles to reach the grail with the other.}

<A>__{indy snaps his look up to his father. his father has never called him this before.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(very calmly)}
<D>__{... let it go...}
<A>__{indy abandons the grail and grabs onto henry with both hands. henry pulls him up to safety.}
<B>__{the grail knight}
<A>__{looks through the falling debris to indy and henry. sallah and brody rush from the crumbling temple.}

<A>__{the grail knight raises his arm to henry.}
<C>__{indy}
