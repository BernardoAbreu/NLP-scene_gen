<A>__{phillip glass' cloudscape plays over: chris paddles on. low angle: it is a narrow gorge of solid rock, looking up from hundreds of feet below the canyon crest.}

<A>__{the canyon has widened to beach like banks. music fades. along the banks he sees a young blonde couple. this is mads and sonja, in their 20's, danish. they play at the river's edge beside their campsite, hotdogs cooking on a hibachi. chris averts his eyes when sonja rises from the water, topless.}
<C>__{mads}
<P>__{(yelling out to chris)}
<D>__{hello!}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{mads}
<D>__{you can join us!}
<A>__{chris doesn't know quite what to do. but mads seems quite comfortable inviting a stranger into the presence of his topless girlfriend.}
<C>__{mads }
<D>__{we have hotdogs!}
<A>__{chris can't turn that down! he paddles to within feet of the water's edge.}
<C>__{mads }
<D>__{i am mads.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{hi. alex.}
<C>__{sonja}
<D>__{i am sonja.}
<A>__{chris gives sonja a little wave. she bypasses it, wading up to the kayak, giving him a big hug.}
<C>__{sonja }
<D>__{hello alex.}
<A>__{this couple is extremely energetic. can't wait to please. and a bona fide american adventurer in their midst. it's everything they could've wanted.}
<C>__{mads}
<D>__{we are from copenhagen. and you are from the rapids.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{sonja}
<D>__{my got!}
<C>__{mads}
<D>__{crazy man. you're a crazy man! sonja, he is a crazy man.}
<P>__{(to chris)}
<D>__{i will make you a hotdog.}
<A>__{mads grabs a hotdog from the hibachi.}
<C>__{mads }
<D>__{just one minute. one minute...}
<A>__{sonja has moved to the tent to put on a dry t shirt. but as she moves back to the water's edge, those nipples keep saying hello. chris, meanwhile, simply cannot wipe the smile off his face in the presence of these warm, open people.}
<C>__{mads }
<D>__{i love this. don't you love this? this is nature. we see it in the american movies. how come you're crazy?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{mads}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{because that's crazy! you come down the rapids. what do you want on your hotdog? mustard and relish?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you have ketchup?}
<C>__{mads}
<D>__{no, i have mustard and relish.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{mustard and relish it is then.}
<C>__{mads}
<D>__{sonja, you want a hotdog?}
<C>__{sonja}
<P>__{(in danish)}
<D>__{of course i want a hotdog. why are you stupid?}
<A>__{mads plops two more hotdogs onto the grill.}
<C>__{mads}
<P>__{(translating)}
<D>__{she asked me why i'm stupid. and i say, well...like i ask you why you're crazy and you say "well." where are you going?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i haven't decided.}
<C>__{mads}
<D>__{we like it here very much. we went to los angeles. and then, we went to las vegas.}
<C>__{sonja}
<D>__{las vegas is very nice. the universe is very good.}
<C>__{mads}
<D>__{and then, we come here. maybe you go to mexico.}
<C>__{mads }
<D>__{you can take kayak around lake mead and then take the river down to mexico.}
<A>__{chris likes the idea.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{how far are we from lake mead?}
<C>__{mads}
<D>__{sonja, how far is hoover dam?}
<A>__{sonja grabs a map from the tent, opens and scrutinizes it. we follow her finger tracing the river.}
<C>__{sonja}
<D>__{maybe three hundred thirty kilometers...like two hundred miles.}
<A>__{sonja walks the map over to chris at water's edge and hands it to him. he studies it.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{man, i wonder if i could go all the way down into the gulf of california.}
<A>__{chris traces his finger along the impossibly long route leading to el golfo de santa clara.}
<C>__{mads}
<P>__{(entering the water with chris' hotdog)}
<D>__{i go with you. we leave sonja here. you and me in kayak we go to mexico.}
<C>__{sonja}
<P>__{(in danish)}
<D>__{you're embarrassing. idiot.}
<A>__{mads with a burst of re exhilaration, grabs chris' hand, shaking it violently.}
<C>__{mads}
<D>__{i like the meeting you.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{thank you. i'm very happy to meet both of you too.}
<A>__{sonja heads back for her hotdog taking her t shirt off on the move. chris is about to bust a gut. sonja returns to her sunbathing. these two are a hoot. just then, something catches chris' attention upriver. we can just barely make out the sounds of a jet boat motor. his eyes narrow a bit, then }
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{well, guys i really appreciate the hospitality but i wanna make camp down river a ways so i better take off before dark.}
