<L>__{exterior boxing auditorium (raining) night}
<A>__{a window about three stories high opens on the auditorium side of the alley. a gym bag is tossed out into a garbage dumpster below the window. then, butch coolidge, still dressed in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, leaps to the dumpster below. esmarelda's reaction takes in the strangeness of this sight. gym bag in hand, butch climbs out of the dumpster and runs to the taxi. before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and throws it to the ground.}
