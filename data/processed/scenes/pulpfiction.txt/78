<A>__{everything seems normal. more or less the right number of cars in the street. none of the parked cars appear out of place. none of them have a couple of goons sitting inside. basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of butch's home. butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information. butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. he crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard. across the street from butch's building, on the corner, is a combination donut shop and japanese restaurant. a big sign sticks up in the air, with the name "teriyaki donut" and a graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.}
