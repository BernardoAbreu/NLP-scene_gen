<ACTION>__{It's a bleak, windy morning, the kind that clears the streets of all but the winos (who carry their own heaters), and the point-men for juvenile gangs.  We pick up a solitary figure, Joe Mottola, coming down the street and entering what appears to be an abandoned tenement.  He pauses a second to dust his white-winged alligator shoes on the back of his pants leg.  Sharply dressed and surrounded by the aura of one who is making money for the first time and broadcasting it on all bands, he seems an incongruity in this part of town. We follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second floor flat.  He knocks on the door, is admitted by a cautious doorman.}
<LOC>__{INT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering, clamoring people.  This is a spot for the numbers racket, a place immune from legal interference, where any sucker can bet on a number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the 600 to 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right.  The bettors are queued up in several lines before a long table, where they place their bets and are given receipts in return. Others wait at a cashier's window to pick up previous earnings or to ask for credit. Mottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting slips are being sorted and money counted under the watchful and somewhat impatient gaze of a Supervisor, an older man named Mr. Granger.  The Yankee-White Sox game is heard on the radio in the background. Mottola, noticing that his entrance has aroused little interest, saunters over to the Phone Girl and gives her a little pinch on the cheek.  The girl slaps his hand away, obviously having been through this before.}

<ACTION>__{Mottola emerges from a side entrance into a narrow alley. He walks briskly down to the end and turns left into a large alleyway; this one connecting two streets.  The alley is deserted save for one scruffy, slovenly dressed young stranger coming toward him from the opposite direction.  The man carries a battered suitcase and seems to be in a hurry. Suddenly, Mottola hears shouting coming from somewhere behind him.  He turns around to see a small, weathered looking thief come racing around the corner and down the alley toward him, frantically pursued by a gray-haired black man.  Limping noticeably, the black man manages a few cries for help and then stumbles and falls.  The stranger yells at Mottola to cover his side of the alley, and then readies himself for the arrival of the thief.  Mottola just stands there, not the least interested in the exercise of justice. Just as the thief is about to run on by, the stranger throws his suitcase at the little man's legs, sending him sprawling and separating him from the wallet he's been carrying in his left hand. The stranger makes a dash for the wallet and kicks it back to where Mottola is standing.  Almost by reflex, Mottola picks it up.  The thief scrambles to his feet and starts back toward his new-found enemy, brandishing a knife.  Both the stranger and Mottola brace themselves for an attack. The thief, realizing that there are two people to fight, begins to think better of it.  He is not a young man, nor particularly strong.}
