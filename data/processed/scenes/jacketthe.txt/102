<L>__{interior jacket tunnel passage}
<A>__{starks stands in the lighted tunnel, which only gets brighter as his heart races with fear in the first seconds that he's back in there. then he sees an image of a woman's forehead that lulls him to a calm until his heart slows and the light gradually dims...}

<L>__{interior diner, small town vermont, 2004}
<A>__{starks enters the diner, calming down even more as he spots jackie. she looks up, holding plates in her hand. she's understandably surprised and unexpectedly pleased when she sees him. she greets him with a small smile. she drops off her orders and then walks up to him.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i will be off in 15 minutes. can you wait till then?}
<L>__{exterior ravine, vermont, day, 2004}
<A>__{starks and jackie smoke in the cold, standing next to the hood of her car.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{the jacket. that's what they call it, right?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of dr. becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. that's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients... starks [starting to make sense] so he was giving me all kinds of drugs... jackie [nodding] apparently. he was taking a lot of them, too. it said he was trying out behavior modification treatments that were banned back in the 70s "womb treatment" is the name he gave to what he did to you... starks [cutting in] womb? a fuckin' womb? what kind of animal did he come out of?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{but no one knew until after...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{after i...}
<A>__{jackie nods.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{[beat] you bled to death.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it. starks [digesting] and you're sure my body was found on january 1st?}
<A>__{jackie nods.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{do you really believe me?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i don't know. [beat] i thought i was crazy after you left that day. i died. i still think i could be crazy. but then i replayed that night in my head the parts of it i could remember and it was like...i don't care if i was, or am. i haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [beat] and when you left, all i wanted was...}
<A>__{jackie looks around her; coupled with the cold, her sobriety is obvious. starks takes hold of her and holds her face close to his so that their foreheads touch.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{[softly] i want to trust you. should i trust you?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{then we need to figure out what happened to you. it's the only thing we can do.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{alpine grove still exists. i looked it up on the net. we should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{if they don't take me out before then. [as an afterthought] what's the net?}
<A>__{jackie looks at him and laughs.}
