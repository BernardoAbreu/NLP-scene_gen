<A>__{duane, behind the wheel, stares straight ahead. it is raining very hard, the windshield wipers are moving quickly. the headlights of another car brightens the interior of duane's car as the camera shows first duane, then annie, then alvy tensely staring straight ahead.}
<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{the camera bolds on a quiet new york city street; the buildings, brownstones. it's a warm day people sit on front stoops, window boxes are planted. annie walks into the frame first, then alvy, who is walking to her right. they walk quickly, side by side, their voices heard before they move into the frame.}
