<L>__{interior exterior roy's pickup street sara and roy night}
<A>__{a heavy silence. roy starts to turn on the radio, stops himself. he lights a cigarette, cracks the window.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i didn't like leavin' you so soon after the funeral. i wouldn't have if you hadn't asked me to go. i mean, i could've hung around. helped you say good bye. that's what you were doin', wasn't it?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{roy takes another drag, nods thoughtfully to himself.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{that's what i figured you were doin'.}
<A>__{sara peers out the windshield. baltimore city. the neighborhoods are changing. the streets are getting progressively gritty and dirty. it surprises her. it worries her. roy worries her.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{look. sara. i feel bad too. i mean, we both got hit by the same bolt of lightning. you don't have to pretend this is easy.}
<P>__{(off nothing)}
<D>__{everything's upside down right now but don't worry. we'll work this bachelor father thing out. hell, it ain't like we're movin' in with strangers. we got a pretty good idea about each other, right?}
<A>__{sara looks askance at him, her expression indicating otherwise. a moment. roy's too new at this to hold up both ends of the conversation. the silence deepens. roy switches on the radio.}
