<A>__{madness. cops lining the edge of the stage, looking worried. as jim throws his leather jacket into the cheering crowd and does the ghost dance around the microphone, indian style, one foot, resurrecting the dead, the power of the circle. the stage is bottom lit, dantean in look. the doors casting giant shadows of heroic proportions. dea agents in suits and short hair take photos from the front of the stage, clipboards in hand. blocked by a row of cops, it is impossible for jim to communicate with his audience.}
<D>__{jim & doors there's been a slaughter here don't stop to speak or look around your gloves and fan are on the ground we're getting out of town we're going on the run and you're the one i want to come not to touch the earth not to see the sun nothing left to do but run, run, run let's run, let's run...}

<C>__{mike}
<D>__{stick my dick in their ear!}
<A>__{jim ignoring all this, one hand cupped to his ear listening for the sound of the earth, gone into a shaman like state, weird spiralling chords carrying over the following montage of hallucinatory insanity.}
