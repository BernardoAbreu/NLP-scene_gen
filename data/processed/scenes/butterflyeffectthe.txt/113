<L>__{interior sorority bedroom morning 2002}
<A>__{finally the memory assault is over. evan groans in pain as blood trickles from his nose. an arm reaches over and touches his shoulder.}
<C>__{kayleigh }
<D>__{honey, are you all right?}
<A>__{evan whips around to see kayleigh watching him. not only is kayleigh alive, but she's a ravishing beauty. evan lurches back from the shock of seeing kayleigh and falls to the floor. she sees evan's nose bleed and her eyes go wide.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{oh my god, evan. you're bleeding! look at you!}
<A>__{evan, still stunned, can do little but stare from the floor.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(transfixed by her)}
<D>__{jesus, kayleigh, you're...}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{incredible.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<P>__{(purring)}
<D>__{mmmm... you give good compliment. clean up and come back to bed.}
<A>__{he stands in the middle of her bedroom, surrounded by sorority plaques and pink preppy decor. evan, hardly able to take his eyes off her as she hands him a tissue. he reaches for his clothes at the foot of the bed and comes up with a greek lettered fraternity sweatshirt and brown suede jacket.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{where... where are my clothes?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{those are your clothes, silly.}
<A>__{evan frowns with distaste, grabs a towel and heads out.}
