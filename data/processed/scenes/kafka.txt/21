<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{the old town night kafka walks the crooked streets in the direction of the plume of smoke and illumination coming from the burning restaurant. in the dark distance behind him there seems to be a person following him.}
<B>__{noisy beer shop}
<A>__{neighborhood denizens have come out, hearing all the excitement not far away. kafka walks past. he looks behind him, but the following figure has gone.}
<B>__{twisted little street}
<A>__{kafka comes around a curve and sees ahead a dark figure a black cape standing waiting under a lone lamppost. when kafka gets a bit nearer, the figure starts to walk slowly away, as if expecting kafka to follow.}
<B>__{dirty yard}
<A>__{the dark figure walks alongside a row of black window panes, turning around the corner where they end. kafka follows around the corner and through a dingy doorway.}
<B>__{a lopsided stairway}
<A>__{leads him up to a large attic. warning shadows.}
<B>__{attic}
<A>__{gloomy except for the light around a table at a far end. kafka advances, seeing gabriela sitting there with her same companions from the coffee house. kafka stops in front of the table.}
<C>__{voice from behind}
<D>__{please sit down.}
<A>__{kafka turns to see the last of the group come in, having obviously tailed him all along. a burly man with a beard. the leader of this anarchist cell. kafka sits down, in between a solemn man with a moustache and a woman with a pockmarked face. the seedy youth who led him in completes the circle.}
<C>__{bearded anarchist}
<D>__{we'll save the introductions.}
<P>__{(takes his seat)}
<D>__{we don't know yet if you're friend or foe.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{strangers make better foes than friends. will you tell me who you are altogether, if not individually?}
<C>__{pockmarked anarchist}
<D>__{heralds of a new age does that sound immodest?}
<C>__{bearded anarchist}
<D>__{you could say we represent the un official view of a well ordered society.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(to gabriela)}
<D>__{ah we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{they're ubiquitous. what we try to do ... is make them a little less so.}
<C>__{bearded anarchist}
<D>__{quite a disturbance tonight, yes? and perhaps you recall last month the explosion at the municipal courthouse that sent one of the examining magistrates to join the heavenly choir.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(disbelieving)}
<D>__{... was eduard one of you?}
<C>__{youthful anarchist}
<D>__{the last to join us, the first to leave us.}
<A>__{gabriela darts a fierce look at her overly flippant colleague. and kafka is sad about his dead friend for a different reason.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{... why take me into your confidence?}
<C>__{pockmarked anarchist}
<D>__{that's obvious, isn't it? we have an opening for a new member.}
<A>__{after a moment's pause, kafka stands up.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{i nominated you as a possible candidate. you were eduard's good friend. he read me some of your work.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{you strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice a high concern for the lot of your fellow men. and yet you're able to remain an outsider. with the concomitant air of ... superiority?}
<C>__{bearded anarchist}
<D>__{in short, a higher man. it's what we want. it's what we need.}
<A>__{kafka notices that the bearded anarchist has a tattoo on the back of his hand.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{the distance to my fellow man is for me quite a journey. as for being an outsider, it's never been a matter of choice.}
<C>__{youthful anarchist}
<P>__{(as kafka starts to leave)}
<D>__{ they may have instituted proceedings against you.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(turns)}
<D>__{what proceedings?}
<C>__{pockmarked anarchist}
<D>__{preliminary investigations may already be underway.}
<C>__{bearded anarchist}
<D>__{you were his friend. one link is all they need.}
<A>__{kafka sits down again. he tries not to be distracted by the solemn anarchist who says nothing but who takes an uncommon interest in seeing how many matches there are in the matchbox he's been fiddling with.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{the day he died, eduard was called up to the castle. did you know that?}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{what of it?}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{he was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the medical records division. apparently one of his claims was relevant.}
<C>__{pockmarked anarchist}
<D>__{ merely in the interests of order, you understand. the officials at the castle like to cover their tracks.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{he was never seen alive again.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{and you still maintain what? that he was murdered.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{he was murdered.}
<A>__{a skylight casts moonglow over the proceedings.}
<C>__{bearded anarchist}
<D>__{as you can imagine, a pass into the castle hardly ever granted was an opportunity we couldn't ignore.}
<C>__{youthful anarchist}
<D>__{the castle represents every anachronism that needs to be destroyed if progress is to be made.}
<C>__{bearded anarchist}
<D>__{as you know, it's not the most accessible location. far from being depressed, eduard was particularly excited when he brought us the news of this chance invitation. he set off that evening carrying one of our custom made briefcases instead of his own.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<P>__{(gauging kafka's reaction)}
<D>__{you're shocked at the thought of eduard tossing a bomb through a window.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i have no right to be, i know. my experience with real life is practically nil.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{when you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{people must think the same of me a quiet, dependable person.}
<C>__{bearded anarchist}
<D>__{you don't have to accept everything as true, my friend. you need only accept it as necessary.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{as the bomb never went off, we can only assume he was caught with it and summarily executed.}
<C>__{pockmarked anarchist}
<D>__{ merely in the interests of order.}
<C>__{bearded anarchist}
<D>__{the formality of a trial would be too costly for them. they're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{propaganda of the dead?}
<C>__{youthful anarchist}
<D>__{the castle will deny he was there any longer than his business required. they're just file clerks up there. no doubt he was handed over to the police with the utmost discretion.}
<C>__{bearded anarchist}
<D>__{in any event, we've felt no repercussions as yet. eduard must not have talked. you're the one they contacted.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{so that's who my foes are policemen and file clerks. law and order, you might say.}
<A>__{the solemn anarchist looks up from his matchbox.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{you think what we're doing is so wrong? and what are you doing? pursuing goodness? for what? to answer to some supreme tribunal?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{my only concern is the human tribunal. isn't it yours?}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{yes which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{at the cost of others? you accuse people of murder without trial apparently without irony. did you go to the castle with eduard?}
<P>__{(apparently not)}
<D>__{then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all even before or after he got there.}
<A>__{he stands to leave again.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{your human tribunal will betray you. just as its members will be betrayed when they find no supreme one}
<A>__{kafka starts walking away.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{join us, kafka.}
<A>__{kafka keeps on going, the anarchists growing smaller as they're left behind in their far corner of the long attic.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{it's sheer folly for anyone to try to pull through alone.}
