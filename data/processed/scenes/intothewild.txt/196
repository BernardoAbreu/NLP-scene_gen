<A>__{we see chris jump down off the back of the duck hunter's truck. he slides the kayak off the truck bed onto the street. chris goes into his pocket, pulls out a sealed sandwich bag of cash. he tries to pay the hunters for their time but they refuse the money. nonetheless, chris is insistent and they relent. chris pulls his backpack from inside the bow and saddles it up on his shoulders. the hunters pull away.}
