<A>__{as the hadrosaurs whip past, paul and amanda climb up into a tree. a raptor leaps at paul, barely missing his leg. trying to pull paul up, amanda nearly loses her balance. this time, paul catchers her. billy climbs up a nearby tree of his own in sight of paul and amanda. udesky has nearly reached a tree of his own when he finds himself}
<B>__{headed off}
<A>__{by a raptor. he turns to the other way, but finds}
<B>__{there are more raptors.}
<A>__{he picks up a fallen branch as these dinosaurs cautiously approach. not more than a few feet away, the leader of the trio stops, peering at him. udesky swings hard, but the dinosaurs feints. from behind him, another raptor slashes at the back of his legs, severing his muscles. udesky cries out and drops to the ground.}
<B>__{in the treetops}
<A>__{paul, amanda and billy can hear him.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{udesky.}
<C>__{amanda}
<P>__{(listening)}
<D>__{he's this way.}
<A>__{from here, the thick branches overlap, forming a kind of "second floor" above the ground. it's not easy, but you can move from branch to branch, tree to tree.}
<B>__{on the floor}
<A>__{unable to walk, udesky attempts to crawl away from the animals. the effort clearly causes him great pain. strangely, the raptors suddenly don't seem interested in him anymore. rather, they're "talking" among themselves. udesky is amazed to find him self still alive. suddenly, one of the raptors slashes at him again. but it's delicately not a mortal blow, just a very painful one. udesky cries out, louder this time.}
<B>__{in the trees}
<A>__{hearing the new cry, paul, amanda and billy move faster, now finally seeing udesky on the ground. he's face down, barely moving but still moaning. the raptors are gone. in the lead, amanda starts to climb down. but paul grabs her, holds her back.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's not safe.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{we have to help him.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{he's right. a predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{he's not a kill, he's still alive.}
<A>__{she breaks from paul's grip and drops to the ground. she's only a foot away from the tree when}
<B>__{all four raptors}
<A>__{lead out from their hiding places. they almost catch her as billy and paul pull her back up on the limb the raptors stare up at them, angry their plan didn't work.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{they couldnt climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{they set a trap}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{they actually set a trap.}
<A>__{bored with waiting, the raptors go back to finish off udesky, making a meal out of it. up in the branches, the survivors are horrified and sickened. then, from the deep in the forest, a new raptor cry. the feasting raptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark jungle.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{where's grant?}
