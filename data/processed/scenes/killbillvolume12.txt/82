<L>__{interior snow covered japanese garden night}
<A>__{as snow falls around them, they stand the correct distance from one another. combat music begins playing, but not japanese drums spanish flamenco guitar....... the bride unsheaths her sword quickly...holding it out in front of her...tip of blade pointed at o ren...sword's handle and her fingers wrapped around that handle, up by her cheek...her eyes are reflected on the blade...snow falls around her. o ren begins walking forward towards the bride...she raises up her sword, still in its sheath, in front of her face vertically...then begins slowly unsheathing it...snow falls around her. o ren's feet white socks in wooden clogs, walk forward, crunching snow underneath them... the bride holding sword...eyes reflected in blade...her yellow sneakers crunching snow underneath them... o ren when her sword is fully unsheathed, the japanese combat artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, sword in one hand wood sheath in the other, like a bird.... ....the two women circle each other.... they swing clash dance separate...circle...swing clash dance separate... o ren leaps in the air does a somersault over the bride's head, landing behind her opponent. she brings her sword down in a slashing swing... slashing the bride across her back spinning her around... o ren goes in for the kill...the bride meets her blade... the blades clash and lock...the two women's faces come together as the blades become entangled... o ren moves her arm in a counter clockwise motion that loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into the bride's mouth... knocking her backwards over a small, stone bench flat on her ass in a koi pond. the combat guitar stops o ren doesn't charge the fallen blonde, she laughs;}
<P>__{o ren (english)}
<D>__{silly caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords. bill might of humored you, but you will find neither humor nor mercy at my blade. now unless you intend to commit sepeku among the koi, stand up and fight. you may not be able to fight like a samurai, but you can at least die like a samurai.}
<A>__{the combat guitar starts again...as the bride slowly rises out of the koi pond. she brings up her sword and says calmly to o ren in japanese;}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{attack me. with everything you have.}
<A>__{the two women clash swords furiously, their attack ends with the bride's striking o ren not fatally but deep. they separate... ...breathing hard...cold air coming out of their mouths like two locomotives... o ren looks down to her wound, then back up to the bride. the respect for the bride's ability is transparent. the two women circle stalk each other again... red blood running down yellow legs onto yellow sneakers... wooden clogs crunching the snow, blood trail dripping down legs staining white socks with red... they attack, the geisha figurine and the tall western girl with the mane of whipping blonde hair. they swing twist turn clash, matching blow for blow till they both back off. both women are out of breath and have to stop to recuperate. as they both drink the harsh cold air into their lungs, leaving red blood stains in the white snow, the two females have the same thought. the next clash will be their last.}
<P>__{o ren (japanese)}
<D>__{i apologize for ridiculing you earlier.}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{accepted.}
<A>__{they continue breathing...}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{ready?}
<P>__{o ren (japanese)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the flamenco guitar begins again, as the two women circle each other for their final attack. with all the quickness and skill at their command, they clash in a superb display of samurai swordplay...till...they find themselves on opposite sides of a garden wall... ...the bride and o ren both begin running diagonally through the snow, swords held up high, facing each other, continuing to run even after they passed the wall, screaming their samurai hearts out...}
<B>__{until...}
<A>__{they both swing... ...can't tell who got who... a scalp of long, black hair flies through the air, landing in the white snow. cu o ren ishii facing away from the bride. sword still in her hand. we see she doesn't have the top of her head on. a touch of her brain is exposed. blood droplets streak her face like raindrops. the queen of the tokyo underworld, who's regime has just ended with one swing, stares off into space.}
<P>__{o ren (english)}
<D>__{that really was a hattori hanzo sword...}
<A>__{her sword falls from her grip...in the snow by her feet.}
<P>__{o ren (english)}
<D>__{i always dreamed of owning one...}
<A>__{o ren falls to her knees, toppling forward. left cheek in the snow, just barely alive, she says;}
<P>__{o ren (english)}
<D>__{did he make it for you?}
<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the last thing she says before she dies;}
<P>__{o ren (english)}
<D>__{...he must of liked you.}
<A>__{with her cheek resting against the snow, her eyes close and she's gone. the bride removes a white handkerchief (the one we saw her sewing earlier with "bill" in the corner), and uses it to wipe the blood, once belonging to the first name on her death list, off her hanzo steel.}
<B>__{ex cu the hanzo sword}
<A>__{is returned back to its sheath. the lion's head that hanzo carved into the wood seems pleased.}
