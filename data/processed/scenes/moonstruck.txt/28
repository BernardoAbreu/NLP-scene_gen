<L>__{exterior the castorini house day}
<A>__{the gates in the big archway are opened from the inside. it's cosmo. he's wearing a good but old fashioned suit, an overcoat, and a homburg. he's pulled his car, a 1965 black buick, up to the gate. now that he has the gates open, he gets in the car and drives out to the curb. he gets out and goes back to lock the gates. as he does this, the old man approaches the house with the five dogs and the open umbrella. the old man and the dogs go to the front door of the house. cosmo goes to the door of his car. the two men, father and son, see each other at the moment they grab their respective door handles. they each raise a hand in greeting; it is the same gesture for both men, an eccentric chopping motion. then they open their respective doors. the old man disappears within the house. cosmo drives slowly away in his car.}
