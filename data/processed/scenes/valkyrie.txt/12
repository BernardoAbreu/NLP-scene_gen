<L>__{interior okh headquarters brandt's office continuous}
<A>__{brandt is at his desk, writing as always. tresckow notices brandt's pistol sitting within arm's reach. a clock ticks loudly. imagine it. then wait. finally: brandt puts his pen down, stands and salutes, but the gesture is almost casual. pure formality.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{you'll forgive me, general. this little round up has had me writing reports all day.}
<C>__{treskow}
<D>__{round up?}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{dissenters. a plot against the fuhrer.}
<A>__{tresckow makes a good show of laughing that off.}
<C>__{treskow}
<D>__{who would even have the balls?}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{you'd be surprised, the number of cowards in this army that would be willing to stand against the reich.}
<C>__{treskow}
<D>__{only if the fuhrer were dead, of course.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{of course. it's one thing to think you know what's right. what matters is having the strength to do it.}
<A>__{clunk. brandt produces the package, putting it on the desk in front of him.}
<C>__{brandt }
<D>__{is this what you've come for?}
<A>__{pause. staying cool, tresckow reaches for it:}
<C>__{brandt }
<D>__{perhaps we should open it.}
<A>__{tresckow freezes, studies brandt's cold smile.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{i beg your pardon.}
<A>__{brandt sits back, smiles. does he know?}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{you've come a long way. you must be thirsty.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{i wonder how the fuhrer, who does not partake, would feel about an officer who did so on duty... colonel brandt.}
<A>__{brandt's smile fades. we can't decide why. he picks up the package carelessly. tresckow stays cool despite the armed explosive just a few feet away.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{i took you for another sort, general.}
<A>__{and we realize he really did just want a drink. he knows nothing about what the package hides.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{and i you.}
<A>__{tresckow reaches out, grabbing the package and: bang. the sound of an explosion o.s. takes us to:}
