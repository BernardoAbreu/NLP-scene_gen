<L>__{exterior baxter building day}
<A>__{the press has died down, but there are still plenty of cameras. a maybach sedan rolls up. victor emerges, wearing sunglasses. this time, the press pay no attention to him. no cameras flash. victor tightens, and enters the building.}
<L>__{interior sue's room day}
<A>__{sue walks out of the bathroom in a robe, drying her hair. she notices a familiar book on a shelf: a scrapbook. she flips through it. it's filled with pictures of reed and his inventions a lot less fancy than victor's multimedia globe. she stops at a picture of her and reed in college. a noise, and she turns, flinching slightly, surprised to see...victor. he smiles, standing at the door, watching her.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{god, i've been so worried about you.}
<A>__{she notices the scar on his head.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{victor, your scar }
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i told you, i'm fine. it's you i'm worried about.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to }
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{please, no apologies. i've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. you'll have round the clock care.}
<A>__{he goes for her bag. but she stops him. a half beat.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{thank you, that's generous, but i think i should stay here. with my brother. until we get a handle on this.}
<A>__{victor is not used to being rebuffed. he gives a thin smile.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{sue. i think you should let my doctors have a look at you.}
<A>__{a tense beat. standoff. made more tense by }
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{victor! what are you doing here?}
<A>__{they turn to see reed approaching, with files in hand.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i'm starting to wonder the same thing... how much do you know about what happened to you?}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{not much. we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.}
<A>__{victor pauses. he looks at sue, knowing she's here to stay.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{well, let me know if there is anything i can do. we're all in this together now.}
<A>__{victor shakes reed's hand. his grip is so tight that reed's fingers stretch. victor lets go, and turns to sue, who puts her hand out. he smiles, and shakes. he heads off. reed looks at his hand. shakes his wrist. he looks at victor.}
