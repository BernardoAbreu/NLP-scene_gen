<T>__{round fifteen:}
<A>__{they clinch. they separate. they both...as if mirror images of each other...crouch, looking for shots. ali's right is down. frazier's right is down. as they both rise up out of the crouch, frazier's out of the box first. ali's right is coming around. frazier's left hook slams ali across the jaw. ali goes down. half the crowd roars for frazier. ali gets right up and stands in the corner and takes the mandatory eight count. the right side of his face is swollen like a balloon. they resume... overhead: another clinch ali takes another right, but the ropes hold him up. another left catches ali. frazier's face is a grotesque, swollen mask. he doesn't care.}
<B>__{ali}
<A>__{is exhausted. labored breathing. the crowd cheering frazier.}
<B>__{then the bell.}
<A>__{ali drops his arms. he knows he lost. frazier raises his arms. he knows he won. half the crowd cheers.}
