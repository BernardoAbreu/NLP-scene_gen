<D>__{the doctor told me that i should hold her in my lap, and let klara drive to the hospital. he asked me to bring a small, sharp knife. it had to be clean. there was no time to sterilize properly. he explained how to perform an emergency tracheotomy. how to cut into my daughter's throat and windpipe without causing her to bleed to death. he told me there'd be a lot of blood. i said i didn't think i could do it. 'if her throat closes up and stops her breathing, you'll have to, mr. stephens. you'll have a minute and a half, two minutes maybe, and she'll probably be unconscious when you do it. but if you can keep her calm and relaxed, if you don't let her little heart beat too fast and spread the poison around, then you might just make it over here first. you get going now', and he hung up.}
