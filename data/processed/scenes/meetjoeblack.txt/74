<L>__{exterior garden, country estate sunset}
<A>__{the very last rays of the sun setting over the wide expanse of river, the light catching susan and joe as they enter the garden, the party forming behind them, the river flowing in front of them.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i like you in a black tie.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i love you in an evening gown.}
<C>__{susan}

<C>__{susan}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<A>__{joe attempts to answer, but nothing comes out.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{you won't tell me?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well i }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{and you can't tell me who you are.}
<A>__{again the same indescribable gesture from joe.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{i'm in love with a man, i don't know who he is, where he's going or when.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i can tell you the when part. tonight.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it gets worse.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no worse than it gets for me. i'm in love with a woman whom i don't want to leave.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{then don't.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{we know so little about each other }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{we know all that we need to know }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{but there's so much to tell you }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{don't. that will come later.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{will it?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{lightning struck. we caught it in a bottle. don't let it out. i want to be with you, joe }
<A>__{another moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what will we do?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{'love will find out the way'.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{'love will find out the way'?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it's a saying.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i believe that, don't you?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{yes, that's why i said it.}
<A>__{they are on the brink of some decision, joe is about to make some declaration when allison is heard }
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{there you are!}
<A>__{allison appears.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{what's going on here? tete a tetes on my big night?}
<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{c'mon honey, you're needed.}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{can it wait?}
<A>__{but before he can answer }
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{glad to hear it!}
<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{she takes susan's arm and marches her off, joe, in thrall, watches them go as the music erupts behind them, as 'up' dance tune, a lilting, catchy melody envelops them all. the curtain has risen on william parrish's 65th birthday party.}
