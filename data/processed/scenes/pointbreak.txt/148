<D>__{don't fucking do it, man!}
<A>__{the guy has his hand on the grip of his pistol but it's like the thing suddenly weighs eight tons, he can't seem to lift it from the holster. roach nixon slips up next to him and helps him with it. the guy is visibly trembling. a young jock makes a move to run. 'our' shotgun comes up like a reflex, right in his face. roach nixon throws the guy to the floor by his hair. ahead of us, bodhi is in action. moving to the counter, shouting }
<D>__{bodhi reagan all tellers back away from the counter! hands on your heads! right now!! that's right. you know the drill.}
<A>__{it's like a replay of the robbery utah saw on video. but he's right in the middle of it, like in some kind of nightmare. we're still in pov, the image whipping wildly from side to side as utah scans the room. we whirl dervish among the statuary of the customers and bank employees. our gaze drifts across the floor manager, a short guy in a brown suit standing with his hands clasped behind his back.}
<D>__{bodhi reagan all customers on the floor. let's go! move it! get down! on the floor! right now! let's go.}
<A>__{roach and grommet are pushing them down. utah stands stiffly with the shotgun. he seems dazed. he catches the eye of a customer. in a tenth of a second we see johnny see the customer see his uncertainty. fear has them both hyper aware. johnny gestures fiercely with the shotgun.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{on the floor, asshole! what's your problem?! i blow your fucking kneecaps out, you'll be on the floor!!}
<A>__{the guy hits the deck like a sack of cement. bodhi reagan floats beside johnny, scanning with the casull. he speaks without turning his head.}
<D>__{bodhi reagan kick in the ass, ain't it? gonna be kinda hard to explain though... when they play the tapes back down at the bureau. could look bad on your monthly evaluation.}
<A>__{johnny looks up at surveillance camera. he's quite fucked.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{can we just get the goddamn money and get out of here?! bodhi reagan that's the spirit!!}
<P>__{(to the room)}
<D>__{head's down! eyes down! just a couple minutes of your life and we're gone.}
<A>__{bodhi leaps to the counter, commanding the room. but at this point they diverge from their time proven plan. roach isn't going for the drawers... he's sprinting for the vault.}
<D>__{bodhi reagan you!}
<P>__{(reading a name tag)}
<D>__{miss jennings... of new accounts. be a dear and open the inner gate for my associate. now!!}
<C>__{miss jennings}
<D>__{he he he has the keys. mr. duggan. bodhi reagan whatta say, mr. duggan? wanna give her the keys or do i pick through the blood and chunks for them?}
<A>__{duggan, the bank manager, is surprisingly calm as he takes the keys from his pocket. holds them out to the terrified woman.}
<C>__{duggan}
<D>__{do whatever they say, terry.}
<A>__{miss jennings hurries to comply. she unlocks the steel cage inside the big vault door. roach nixon and grommet lbj take her inside with them. a customer, lying on the floor near the fat guard catches his eye. the guard, face jammed against the linoleum, blanches as he sees the customer lift a corner of his shirt to reveal the butt of a pistol. the customer mouths the words "i'm a cop". the guard is hyperventilating. at the front doors a woman comes in out of the bright sunlight. jfk pulls her in fast and throws her to the floor. then goes back to watching the street. johnny is next to bodhi reagan.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{you're blowing it, man! you're breaking your own rules... pulling too much time! bodhi reagan jfk, how we doin'? nathaniel jfk all clear, man!}
<A>__{inside the vault grommet and roach are pillaging rapidly. their hands blur as nice fat stacks of 20s and 100s are dumped into canvas sacks. on the main floor the off duty cop slips his hands slowly around the butt of his pistol, concealing the move with his body. he signals with his eyes to the fat guard, glancing at the guard's ankle. tight on the guard's ankle where we can see a sliver of back up gun, a tiny .25 auto in an ankle holster. the guard's eyes are pleading with the hard on cop. "don't make me do this". the guy is sweating, shaking. a yellow liquid spreads across the tiles next to his quivering hips. he's actually pissing himself, he's so scared. tight on the off duty cop. watching like a ferret. he cocks his .38. ecu guard's eyes, wide with terror. it happens like lightning. the cop pops to his knees, straight arming the .38. the guard goes for his ankle holster. reagan spins. the cop fires. blam! reagan is catapulted backward off the counter by the impact. he crashes onto a desk on his back. slides off, scattering papers. a teller screams. the cop spins toward utah. johnny throws down the shotgun. shows his palms. he's holding out his gold star.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{federal agent! undercover!}
<A>__{the cop fires twice. two in the chest. utah is hurled back. slams into the tellers' counter. nathaniel lbj lets go with the 12 gauge. boom! the cop spins, hit by some 00 buck pellets. the guard caps off like a maniac. blam, blam, blam, blam!!! all of them wild, but serving to get nathaniel pinned down behind a check writing island. roach nixon leaps the counter and lands behind the guard. the guard's shoulder explodes as roach's 12 gauge detonates. he pitches onto his face, screaming and holding the wreckage of his upper arm. grommet lbj is coming over the counter behind roach as the off duty cop spins and fires. blam! blam! roach takes it in the chest. staggers back, firing into the floor. trips and drops his shotgun. grommet clutches his throat as blood streams over his fingers. in slow motion reagan's face rises above the counter. the mask is askew. in order to see, bodhi pulls it off. the casull comes up in a slow, deliberate arc as the cop turns, terrified now, whipping his gun around, nightmarishly slow as bodhi cocks the casull in dream time and kaboooom!!! the world's most powerful handgun proves its claim at 2000 feet per second. a gout of hamburger explodes out of the cop's chest. he is lifted off his feet. hits and slides across the floor leaving a two foot wide red smear. echoes slap the walls. then all is still. plaintive whimpering and moaning. the air is blue with smoke. johnny is trying to catch his breath. he rips his shirt open to see two deep indentations in the second chance vest. flattened .38 slugs caught in the kevlar mesh. but no blood. bodhi drops over the counter near utah. the two men look at each other. bodhi's eyes seem lost. he stares around at the carnage he has wrought, the bloody wreckage of his ego game. his expression changes to something new truly crazed now. we feel that the madness which has been held in check so long has been let off its leash.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{don't anybody fucking move!}
<A>__{roach, clutching his side, moves to grommet, who is on his knees. beneath lbj's stony countenance a river of blood flows down grommet's chest. roach pulls off the mask. revealing a terrified kid. grommet pulls his blood drenched hand away from his throat, stares at it bug eyed.}
<C>__{grommet}
<D>__{oh no, oh my god, oh god... it's all comin' out man, gotta stop it... it's all gonna come out... do something!!}
<A>__{he's trying to hold it in with his hands. this doesn't work. a paste white frightened kid. eighteen years old. suddenly realizing that this is not some video game. that death is real. he slumps back, losing the battle for consciousness.}
<B>__{we hear sirens approaching.}
<C>__{roach}
<P>__{(freaking to bodhi)}
<D>__{we gotta bug out, man! we're eatin' it bad on this one. let's go!}
<A>__{bodhi reaches down and picks up johnny's fbi shield off the floor. he considers it for a long time. then looks up at johnny. his eyes seem to ask for forgiveness... a moment before he smashes the casull into johnny's skull. johnny's pov, as he drops to his knees. everything going dark as we see bodhi's face distantly, his mouth moving slowly...}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{goodbye, johnny.}
<A>__{the floor rushes up and smashes us in the face. a view of shoes, running away from us, leaving bloody footprints. then total darkness.}
