<A>__{natalie is washing her hands, when she stops to look at herself in the mirror. after a beat, she hears someone crying in one of the stalls. she goes to see if the woman is okay, then stops herself maybe i fired her. she grabs a paper towel, dries off her hands, and leaves.}
<L>__{interior restaurant bar, st. louis hilton evening}
<A>__{natalie sits back down at the table a little visibly shaken.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{natalie}
<P>__{(covers quickly)}
<D>__{yeah. fine.}
<A>__{just then, their food arrives... and there's a lot of food. natalie's eyes move back and forth trying to figure out why there seems to be three main courses and a bunch of sides.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{hungry, much?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{our expense account allots for forty dollars each on dinner. i plan on grabbing every mile i can.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{okay, you got to fill me in on this mile business. what's that all about? are you talking like frequent flier miles?}
<A>__{ryan gives natalie a look is she ready for this information?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{your really want to know?}
<C>__{natalie}
<P>__{(mock serious)}
<D>__{i'm dying to know.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i don't spend a nickel, if i can help it, unless it somehow profits my mileage account. i'm not talking hotel rooms and rental cars either, but internet services, cell phone, music downloads, teleflorists. the works. i shop them according to the miles they pay and i pit them against each other for the most value.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{so, what are you saving up for? hawaii? south of france?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{no, it's not like that... the miles are the goal.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{that's it? you're saving to save?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{let's just say i've got a number in mind and haven't hit it yet.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{wow. seems a little abstract. what's your target?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i'd rather not.}
<C>__{natalie}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{it's a secret target?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{it's ten million miles.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{huh. isn't ten million just a number?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{pi is just a number.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i guess we all need a hobby.}
<A>__{ryan looks back at natalie hobby?}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{oh hey, i didn't mean to belittle your collection. i get it. sounds cool.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i'd be the seventh person to do it. more people have walked on the moon.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{do they give you a parade or something?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{lifetime exec platinum status. you get to meet the chief pilot, maynard finch. and... they put your name on the side of a plane.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{men get such a hard on from putting their name on stuff... you guys don't grow up you just need to pee on everything.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{now, who's stereotyping?}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{fear of mortality. it's like yes, you're going to die one day.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{and why do you suppose that's singular to men?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{probably cause you can't have babies.}
<A>__{ryan can't help but laugh a little.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{if i had that many miles, i'd just show up at the airport, look up at one of those big destination boards, pick a place and go.}
<A>__{this idea sinks in for a second with both of them.}
