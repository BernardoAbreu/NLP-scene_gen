<A>__{hadley sits behind his desk.}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{it's completely legal, jacob. the funds reverted back to the pre trust posture... that means the money was technically gordon's again.}
<A>__{hadley just shrugs...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{but he's not allowed to trade.}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{he didn't trade.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{he put the money into the hedge fund, that's considered capital investment.}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{jacob, gordon never put the money into a hedge fund. he simply took control of the bank.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{bank? what bank?}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{hudson river. i told you about the position in the bank.}
<A>__{jacob's stunned...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hudson river... ? i don't understand.}
<A>__{slam into buchanan new york a sleepy town...}
<C>__{hadley }
<D>__{well, gordon had placed his hudson river shares into the trust before he was convicted. you do know he started out there?}
<A>__{a rental car parks out front of a small bank. jacob emerges and heads for the bank...}
<D>__{hadley (v.o.) (cont'd) okay, then the trust aggressively acquired more shares about two years ago... enough to have a controlling position in the bank.}
<A>__{and jacob stops walking when he sees... a group of angry depositors forming outside and a sign hanging in the doorway... "closed."}
<B>__{and right back to}
<A>__{jacob and hadley...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{but how? gordon wasn't allowed to control the trust.}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{that's right. all of the trust's moves were made by its executor.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{sammy redding?}
<A>__{confused...}
<C>__{hadley}
<D>__{sammy redding? who the hell is sammy redding?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{jacob, the executor of winnie's trust has always been bretton woods.}
<A>__{and as that slams into jacob moore...}
