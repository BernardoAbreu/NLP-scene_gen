<L>__{interior burnett's kitchen morning}
<A>__{pandemonium. there's the two and a half year old, megan, who's taking bites of food and spitting it back out, looking at it, then putting it back in. six year old jill, who is playing refrigerator magnet games on the fridge. and marcus in the middle of it all, deftly side stepping his eight year old boy, quincy, who appears on roller blades whizzing through with a hockey stick and ball. he body checks jill against the ice box.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{mom, quincy pushed me.}
<C>__{quincy}

<P>__{(then, exasperated)}
<D>__{marcus, why do i always have to discipline the kids? you play bad cop for a second.}
<A>__{alongside the kitchen screen door we see lowrey's porsche roar to a stop in the driveway.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{kids, knock it off... or your momma's gonna whoop your butts!}
<A>__{theresa laughs in spite of herself as the kids continue to fight. into this craziness enters mike lowrey...}

<C>__{quincy}
<D>__{tell us some stories, uncle mike. you know, the one about the stewardess?}
<C>__{theresa}

<D>__{you're live with lowrey.}
<P>__{(listens for a long beat)}
<D>__{'scuse me, captain. i think you mean to say, 'get the fuck down here, please?'}
<A>__{burnett automatically pulls on his jacket, hugs the children as lowrey hangs up.}
<C>__{theresa}
<D>__{not so fast. you were going to take the kids to school today, remember, hon? i have a job interview...}
