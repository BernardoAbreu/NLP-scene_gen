<L>__{interior hotel room night}
<A>__{standard fare. two beds and a t.v. chuck's lacing a new pair of sneakers. charles is in the shower. there is a knock at the door. chuck cracks the door. it's charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we gotta talk.}
<L>__{interior boathouse night}
<A>__{the crew stand by the bulkhead. bill tosses down a newspaper. the headline reads: investigation to probe}
<B>__{school ship tragedy.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{we're all going to have to testify. they're going to try to take his license.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{they need it to be simple. they need a reason.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{all of them. everybody waiting on that dock.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{so what are we supposed to do?}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{just tell 'em what we know and be done with it. that's what he'd want.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{easy for you to say.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?!}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{everybody knows why she went over tod. you jibed the boat.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{i was trying to get her up wind! that's what you do when you're hit a beam. or maybe you're too stupid to know that!}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{that's not what skipper thought. he was trying to spill air from the main!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it was coming four points off the bow, terry. he never could have gotten her around.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{were you on deck? i was standing right there and all i know is, he...}
<P>__{(indicates tod)}
<D>__{... disobeyed an order, twice, and the boat went over.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{it didn't go over 'til i turned her starboard!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it was an act of god for christ's sake.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{it was an act of stupidity.}
<A>__{tod lunges at terry. bill and charlie pull them apart.}
<C>__{tod}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{was it my fault we were running all that sail?! was it my fault she wasn't dogged down?!! huh?!! i couldn't help that the ballast shifted...! you son of a bitch!! it wasn't my fault!! it wasn't.}
<A>__{tod breaks down, sodding on his knees.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it's okay, tod.}
<A>__{terry drags on a cigarette, then grinds out the butt.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{then whose?}
<A>__{tod looks up along with bill and charlie, all confused.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{after the lightning strike, we tried to go aloft to drop sail. we'd done it a thousand times. we didn't have to wait for an order. but skipper called us down.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{if the foremast had taken a strike, everyone in the rigging would've been fried. what would you have done?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{we would have scalloped the squares from the deck. right bill?}
<A>__{bill turns and stares into the water, troubled.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{that's right, that's right! bleed the sails from the deck and she could've taken a hurricane!}
<A>__{it's a strong argument. even charlie is troubled by the implication. there is a long moment of silence between them.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{this is crazy. nothing could have prevented what happened.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you guys are missing the pointerior this is all because of phil. phil and his dear old dad.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{how do you think they got this together so fast? he's been laying for skipper since the first day.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{come on. like he's got a vendetta or some such shit?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you got it.}
<P>__{(to chuck)}
<D>__{i told you he was a turn coat the day we kicked him off the boat.}
<A>__{chuck frowns, troubled.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{no. you're wrong.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i'm telling you, the only way to change this is to get phil to call off his old man. and that ain't gonna happen. so the way i see it, it's skipper or us.}
<A>__{the guys react. it's a no win situation.}
