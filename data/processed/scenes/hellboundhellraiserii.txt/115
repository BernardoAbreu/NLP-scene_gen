<L>__{interior basement corridor day}
<A>__{the basement corridor is long, cavernous, and not very pleasant. it has a grimier, more uncared for look than the upper floors and the high ceiling is covered with an intricate system of naked pipes and conduits. the interns wheel larry down this corridor, going so fast that kirsty and tiffany are continually breaking into a trot to keep up with them. at the far and of the corridor are a set of double doors. the nearer they all get to these doors, the tackier the corridor seems to become. the walls now have pipes running over them, as well as the ceiling, and several of these pipes are dripping water into small pools on the corridor floor. the sound of these drips is artificially loud on the soundtrack. finally, the doors are reached and the interns, larry, kirsty and tiffany disappear through them.}
