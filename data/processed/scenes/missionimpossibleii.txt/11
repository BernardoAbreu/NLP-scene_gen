<A>__{close ethan (int exterior safehouse seville day eve) sleeping. his eyes open slowly. he comes to full consciousness, his head still on the pillow. something approaching serious anxiety informs his features. he lifts his head and looks at his left, angle widening. nyah lies on her side facing him, sleeping serenely. anxiety on the order of oh god this isn't approved recruiting technique, confirmed. he lets his head flop back on the pillow. then he turns so he and nyah are profile to profile. as he looks at her sleeping his anxiety fades, replaced by curiosity and even wonder. he lifts his hand and just brushes her cheek. her eyes open. she knows where she is.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{so what've you got against spooks?}
<A>__{nyah smiles.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{when they've got your recruiting technique? not a thing.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{oh. well..this isn't exactly by the book.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{they've got a book for this?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{they've got a book for everything.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{the only other spook i knew was a liar. charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth. he'd lie about his favorite color. but then i reckon it's an occupational hazard. all spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{that's not the pointerior in the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{which is?}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{that they're lying.}
<A>__{ethan laughs.}
<C>__{nyah }
<D>__{..once they know that they can get very very..crosee..}
<A>__{nyah shoulder and moves into ethan.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{so where did i got right?}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{you're not a liar. or you're an awfully good one..}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{..this thing these blokes pinched..}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i don't know that they 'pinched' it. don't even know that they're blokes.}
<A>__{nyah stops to think about this.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{well, then, what i am i doing here? i assume i'm meant to be some sort of thief to catch a thief..}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{so do i. sort of.}
<A>__{nyah looks at ethan, a little worried.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{of what?}
<A>__{nyah laughs.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{ask a question, you get an answer!..}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{damn, you're beautiful.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{that's because i'm on my back.}
<A>__{quick as a cat ethan flips nyah over so she's looking down at him.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{she sinks into his arms.}
