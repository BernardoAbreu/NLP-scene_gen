<L>__{interior lincoln town car moving late afternoon}
<A>__{the car is covered in dust and mud from the road. it's worse inside: food wrappers, empty bottles, pieces of clothing, filthy windows. they've been living in it. wesley's driving now. charlie's almost unrecognizable: a six day beard, uncombed greasy hair, bloodshot eyes, rumpled clothes and an exhausted, faraway look. the photo of betty faces him, taped to the glove box. he is reading from the diary, which he clutches like the bible. they roar along a desert highway, passing a sign that says "grand canyon, this exit. 74 miles." charlie looks up, marking his place.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we should go.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{we don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. we can make vegas in four hours. this one's got to be her.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's a very moving experience, trust me.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{one of the seven natural wonders of the world.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{no... be dark before we get there. you wanna see the grand canyon at night?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what difference does it make? she wasn't in kansas city, or houston, or dallas. we went to every goddamn place del mentioned and no betty. so what the hell makes you think she's in vegas? you think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? vegas is too crass for betty.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{i said, 'no.' n o.}
<A>__{charlie turns to a passage and reads aloud.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{"when i grow up i'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. i always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."}
<P>__{(to wesley)}
<D>__{does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{do you hear yourself right now...? like a fucking madman...}
<A>__{wesley drives on stoically. the exit comes and goes.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{every american should see the grand canyon. are you an american?}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{yes, i am and we're not going. act professional.}
<A>__{charlie stares at him, hate rising from just below the surface. he draws a nickel plated pistol and points it at wesley's head. wesley looks at it and keeps on driving. charlie knows this isn't the way to handle it. he lowers the pistol.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{if you don't take the next turn for the canyon, i'm blowing my goddamn brains all over this car.}
<A>__{he puts the pistol in his mouth and cocks it. wesley looks over, not so sure this time. long shot of the black town car as the turn signal comes on, and it eases onto a lonely dirt road. their headlights pick out a sign that says: "grand canyon fire trail. forestry personnel only."}
