<L>__{interior clyde's cell night}
<A>__{...and enters through a swiveling portal concealed behind the toilet. in deep darkness now, he pulls his cell phone, starts inputting a number boop...boop...boop... and he freezes. realizing... there's somebody in there with him...a silhouette sitting on the floor by the door. the figure reaches out, pushes open the outer door a bit. faint light spills in, revealing:}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i came to talk. guess who wasn't in his cell? imagine my surprise.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{imagine mine.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{beautiful how you played us. getting yourself tossed into solitary pre rigged with exits from all five cells. whichever one we put you in, you had your bases covered.}
<P>__{(faint smile)}
<D>__{i thought i was such a bad ass putting you down here. turns out i was doing what you wanted.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{that's how you play. make the other guy think it's his idea.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you came to talk, so talk.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{been thinking. if i'd done things differently made different decisions from the start we wouldn't have gotten to this pointerior}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{but it happened. and here we are.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{here we are.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{your decisions put us here too. this mess is on both of us.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{you want to hold hands? what's your point?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{we can't change decisions we've made. we can only account for decisions we make from here. i know what mine will be.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what about you? you gonna finish dialing that number, or what?}
<A>__{clyde hesitating, thumb hovering over the number pad.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{if i don't? what are you offering?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you looking to deal?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i'm willing to listen.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{okay, here's the deal. the deal is...there is no deal.}
<P>__{(off clyde's look)}
<D>__{i told you. no more deals with murderers. i'm sticking to that. that's my decision. it's what you taught me. strange as it sounds, i'm grateful for the lesson.}
<A>__{nick rises, steps out pauses, turns back.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{your turn. you make the right decision, i will see what i can do for you. but the wrong decision is one you'll have to live with the rest of your life.}
<A>__{the moment stretches. clyde poised all down to this. in the end, he can't help himself: boop boop boop hits send.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{me too...}
<A>__{nick pushes the barred door shut...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{...because like i said, it's a decision you'll have to live with the rest of your life. which at this point i figure is...}
<P>__{(glances at watch)}
<D>__{...another 35 seconds.}
<A>__{...and turns the key in the lock klatch.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{check mate.}
<A>__{clyde hears a sound...like a phone ringing sort of close but not muffled like the sound cantrell heard... clyde, realization dawning, thrusts his hand out and jerks the cot blanket up, revealing: the steel briefcase under his cot. he glances up to see: nick gone. clyde scrambles to his portal, yanks on the handle... clyde's staging area (under the cells) angle on: the hatch handle rattles now padlocked shut.}
