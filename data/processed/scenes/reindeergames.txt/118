<D>__{hey jumpy, i want to ask you something. you have any problem with the fact that we're on our way to take millions of dollars from an indian casino?}
<A>__{the native american considers. as they walk:}
<C>__{jumpy}
<D>__{nick. it's true that indian gaming's gone a long way toward restoring wealth and pride to communities who've been economically isolated and enslaved for centuries. stronger infrastructure, better schools, higher employment... they're all the results of reservation casino success stories. still, many natives believe that these are temples to a godless materialism and greed that will only infect the souls of indigenous peoples until their love of money has destroyed the spiritual values their ancestors died to protect and their homelands have become no different from any united states suburb, satellite city or industrial park. destroying the indian legacy once and for all and leaving behind a nation of selfish, angry natives, of which i, it's true, am one }
