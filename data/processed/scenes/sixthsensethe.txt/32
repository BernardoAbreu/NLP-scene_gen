<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior den afternoon}
<A>__{the den doubles as a playroom. boxes of old toys sit in the corner. a small, plastic, multi colored table sits on the rug. cole appears in the doorway. malcolm sits up and smiles. he points to the chair on the other side of the coffee table.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you want to sit?}
<A>__{cole nods very softly, "no."}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{don't feel like talking right now?}
<A>__{cole nods again very softly, "no."}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{how about we play a game first?}
<A>__{cole looks a little more interested.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it's a mind reading game... did i mention i could read minds?}
<A>__{cole nods, "no."}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{here's the game. i will read your mind. if what i say is right, you take a step forwards the chair. if i'm wrong, you take a step backwards the doorway. if you reach the chair, you sit. if you reach the door, you can go. deal?}
<A>__{cole tilts his head, then nods, "yes." malcolm presses his fingers to his temples like a vaudeville magician. he closes his eyes tight.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{just after your mom and dad were divorced, your mom went to a doctor like me and it didn't help her. and so you think i'm not going to help you.}
<A>__{beat. cole, surprised, takes a small step forward.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you're worried because she said she told him things. things she couldn't tell anybody else.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{secrets.}
<A>__{cole takes a step. malcolm opens his eyes. he looks right at cole.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you have a secret. but you don't want to tell me.}
<A>__{beat. cole takes another step. the next step will put him at the chair. malcolm lowers his fingers from his temple.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{you don't have to tell me your secret if you don't want to.}
<A>__{malcolm smiles. returns his fingers to the mind reading position. malcolm looks to cole's arm. cole is wearing a large silver watch. it swims on his thin wrist. it could probably slide up to his shoulder. malcolm closes his eyes.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{your father gave you that watch as a present before he left.}
<A>__{cole takes a step back. beat. malcolm lowers his hands surprised.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{he forgot it in a drawer. it doesn't work.}
<A>__{beat. malcolm puts his fingers to his temple. this time a little bit slower. he gazes at cole's school uniform.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you don't like to say much at school. you're an excellent student however. you've never been in any kind of serious trouble.}
<A>__{beat. cole takes a slow step back. beat.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{we were supposed to draw a picture. anything we wanted... i drew a man. he got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.}
<B>__{an uncomfortable silence overtakes the den.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you saw that on t.v., cole?}
<A>__{cole answers by taking a small step back. beat.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{everybody got upset. they had a meeting. momma started crying.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't draw like that anymore.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{how do you draw now?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they don't have meetings about rainbows.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{i guess they don't.}
<A>__{malcolm looks down at cole's feet. they're almost at the doorway. one more step and he's there. cole is very still. he doesn't move at all.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{what am i thinking now?}
<A>__{malcolm takes his time before speaking. he just stares. no fingers to the temple. no games. he just stares. beat.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you're thinking...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't know what you're thinking, cole.}
<A>__{cole quietly takes a step back into the doorway of the other room.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i was thinking... you're nice.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but you can't help me.}
<A>__{cole's tiny figure steps away. malcolm stares helplessly at the empty doorway where his client used to stand.}
<B>__{the den is suffocated with silence.}
