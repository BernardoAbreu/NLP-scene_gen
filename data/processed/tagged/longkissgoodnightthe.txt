<A>__{assaulted from without by snowflakes. wind tossed. inside, a bed, dappled with moon shadow. a little girl, fast asleep. the wind whistles and sighs outside. she dreams... eyelids closed, eyes roving beneath... then suddenly they snap open. a stifled cry. she thrashes for her stuffed bear, as a soft voice says:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{shhhhh.}
<A>__{and there's mom, kneeling beside her. vague shape in the dimness. the full moon throws light across one sparkling eye.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{mommy, the men on the mountain...!}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{shhhh. gone, all gone now.}
<P>__{(strokes her hair)}
<D>__{i'm here. mommy's always here and no one can ever hurt you. safe now... safe and warm... snug as a bug in a rug.}

<D>__{i will sit with you, think you can sleep?}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{turn on the nightlight.}
<A>__{the mother nods. passes her left hand gently over the girl's forehead.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{close your eyes now. i love you.}
<A>__{the child subsides, breathing steady. eyes closed. the mother rises. regards her through the dimness. slowly turns, heads for the door. flicks on a winnie the pooh nightlight her entire right forearm is slicked with blood. more blood on her czech made mp 5 machine gun. she staggers just a little... barely noticeable. passes out on the light. into darkness. sits beside her daughter's bed. the child sleeps peacefully. outside snow slithers at the glass.}

<L>__{exterior suburban street day}
<A>__{children, dozens of them, bursting from houses. slapping of screen doors. a horse driven sleigh is rattling down main street. flanked by kids. christmas carols, droning from loudspeakers. happy, laughing santa waves howdy, chortling his "ho's" in groups of three, meanwhile he's really a grizzled old fire marshall named earl, freezing his nuts off. beside him sits mrs. claus, about whom we notice two things: first, she's the june in this june december pair and second, she's to kill for, an effortlessly beautiful woman. for the record, meet samantha caine.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{how you holdin' up?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{freezing my nuts off.}
<A>__{santa produces a bottle of seagrams. starts to open it.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{put that away.}
<A>__{earl complies, grumbling. some teenage burnouts howl from a street corner:}
<C>__{burnout}
<D>__{ow! mrs. claus is hot!}
<A>__{samantha squirms in her seat, scowling.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{i can't take it, earl, this dumb costume is giving me a wedgie. driving me crazy, but there's these kids here }
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{right, you don't wanna be rootin' }
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{in front of little billy, age four, yeah. "look, mommy, mrs. claus chooses to go butt mining."}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{this is little billy talking?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{age four, kid's unbelievable.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{i'm too old for this, earl.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{yeah, yeah. spare me, i got a prostate the size of a melon.}

<C>__{earl}
<D>__{it's not that fucking little billy again, is it?}
<T>__{series of shots:}
<A>__{throughout the following narration, we watch sam: 1) rallying the varsity cheerleaders; 2) showing off a gerbil to her seventh graders; 3) kneeling in church with her husband, blessing herself; 4) absently fingering a silver key which she wears round her neck; and finally 5) probing at a tiny ridged scar under her hairline.}
<C>__{samantha }
<D>__{eight years. i keep hiring detectives, but they never find anything.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i was born 3000 days ago on the beach in new jersey. i entered the world fully grown, wearing clothes i don't remember buying. nothing in the pockets but a single key, filed smooth.}

<D>__{hal, i gotta tell you, of all the christmas pageants i've seen, this was by far the most recent.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{aw, honey, i had teenage girls playing the wise men, what'd you expect?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{teenage boys?}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{well, i thought they did fine.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{just fine? come on, it was ground breaking stuff. the first nativity where joseph stares at the wise men's tits all night.}
<A>__{she hugs him good naturedly. as they near their house, an eight year old girl drops from a treehouse and comes running, leaps into mommy's arms }
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{hey, you!}
<A>__{the kid leaps into her arms, as we hear:}
<C>__{samantha }
<D>__{her name is caitlin. she's my daughter and when i woke up on that long ago day, she was two months grown in my belly. i don't know who put her there. i may never. i just know she's mine, and she's about to turn eight.}

<D>__{what the hell is this...?!!}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{don't give me an attitude, sir. you're assuming i won't shoot your sorry ass, and everyone knows when you make an assumption, you make an ass out of u and mption. i'm sergeant madigan, vice, and if you cop a 'tude, jerkoff, i will see to it you spend the next ten years in prison getting ass fucked, and if the case is thrown out because my arrest is too violent, then i will personally hire men to ass fuck you for ten years. so if you're an ass fucking fan, go ahead and mouth off, but meanwhile you're under arrest for the crime of prostitution, now shut the fuck up before i cut out your kneecaps and use 'em as ashtrays.}

<L>__{interior prison television viewing room evening}
<A>__{a tired tv set drones to an audience of one. let's call him one eyed jack. in fact, let's give him one eye, the other replaced by a patch. he smokes cigarettes, stubs them out on the chair's armrest. throws offhand glances at the tv screen.}
<C>__{news anchor }
<D>__{...so much for the flame swallowing santa of boone county. meanwhile, ktva news journeyed to upper sandusky, where santa's own mrs. kringle turned out to celebrate her hubby's worldwide tour. after one look at her, i'm thinking santa got what he wanted this christmas.}
<A>__{the happy news chatter continues. jack isn't listening. jack isn't talking or breathing either. he's simply staring at the tv screen, jaw slack...}

<A>__{he screams as we cut to:}
<L>__{exterior woodlands with samantha driving}

<C>__{earl}
<D>__{goddamnit, i'm not drunk. would a drunk man have this much raw talent?}
<A>__{he starts playing the hawaiian nose harp. in sam's ear, she can't help it, snorts laughter the adult deer appears perfectly framed in the sunbird's headlights. dead ahead. sam looks up, face etched in sudden terror. no time to think. swerves, no dice...! broadsides the animal and it comes through the windshield. all two hundred and fifteen pounds of it. fucks up their night altogether. actually, it only makes it halfway through but the damn thing is alive. more than alive. kicking. thrashing. squawling with pain and rage. a flailing hoof takes out earl. kills him in less than a second. collapses his skull. sam rides the wheel, screaming. an antler gouges her chest. rips. draws blood. she swerves, madly hits the tree doing}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{sam goes airborne. explodes through the windshield, outward bound. shower of glass, spritz of blood... and then she's flying. slow motion, end over end... we lose all sound. silence as she tumbles. below and behind her, the sunbird noiselessly erupts. fireball, sky high sam floating. describes a lazy arc in mid air... whoomph ! disappears into the snow. swallows her, leaves a silhouette. around her, trees catch fire. burn. she lies in her impromptu sarcophagus. out of sight. the flaming deer totters from the wreck, thrashing. scene from a nightmare. nightmare part two: from the snow, from the human shaped divot arises a woman of blood. she stumbles from the drift. toward the wreck. and though it's clearly sam caine under all that crimson, there's something wrong about her eyes. en route to the car, she kneels beside the suffering deer, its flesh scorched and torn and kills it. puts it away with a sharp crack !ing blow to the head. stands, eyes squirming with madness... the car's an inferno. earl is dead. she turns away, wiping blood from her eyes comes face to face with a snowman. a jolly white fellow. charcoal briquettes for eyes. she watches, fascinated, as he melts in the blast furnace heat with warning, she screams. crumples to the ground. the snowman's eyes fall out. he melts away and away...}

<D>__{i want a cigarette, why do i want a cigarette...?}
<A>__{outside, snow slithers... her eyelids, slowly closing. slides off the edge of consciousness... in the dream: she stands on a windswept cliff, before an incongruous full length mirror. staring at her reflection it's bleeding from a scalp wound. she probes her head... frowns. nothing. nothing but the tiny ridged scar she's had for as long as she can remember.}
