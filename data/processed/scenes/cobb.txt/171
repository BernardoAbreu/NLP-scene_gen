<D>__{i will, stumpy, i will...}
<A>__{cobb is out of the car on his cane following stump.}

<D>__{oh, i will do that, too.}

<D>__{and look how convenient you've made it.}
<A>__{they look up the entrance to the royston cemetery. a casually maintained slope of several acres up a hill.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{that was your sister alright, and she didn't want anything to do with you either!}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i forgive her.}
<A>__{stump walks into the cemetery to escape cobb, who follows nonetheless with a cool resolution. stump laughs at cobb's comment.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{you forgive her?! that's rich!}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(following along)}
<D>__{forgiveness is crucial to human maturity and religious growth.}

<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{we all need to forgive more, al... you oughta try it. you're too angry. you're all pent up.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{i'm angry?}
<A>__{through the cemetery they keep walking, up a long hill full of tombstones and shrines and sprays of dead and dying flowers and gaudy plastic bouquets. cobb following steadily along with his cane, several paces behind stump. thunder shakes the ground. and more lightning.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{are you angry because i discovered you were a whore? is that it, alimony?}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{i'm angry?!}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{is it the divorce? you gotta let go of it...}

<D>__{i love her! i don't want a divorce!}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{sure ya do. you're just so used to accommodating people that you don't know what you want anymore. i accommodate nobody.}
<A>__{stump whirls near the top of the hill to face cobb who continues making his way along, slowly and surely.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{but you have no friends!}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{do you? who are they?! those drunken hacks you hang out with who all think they're gonna write the great american novel but all they're gonna ever do is bitch and moan and write lousy leads about high school football games? how about the brunette in the courtyard? is she your friend? i heard she fucks everybody she must be everybody's friend!}
<A>__{a mausoleum looms behind stump, bigger than anything in the cemetery, classical, outsized, monumental, even elegant. one simple word is above the door, carved in granite: cobb.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i'm glad we're here i was gonna bring you here anyway sooner or later }
<A>__{stump turns to see the mausoleum, and the word cobb.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{which cobb of georgia is that?}
<A>__{several beats as the men take it all in. finally:}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(with pride)}
<D>__{that is me.}
<A>__{and rain suddenly falls from the skies, threatening to soak the two men. cobb heads for the mausoleum stump follows.}
