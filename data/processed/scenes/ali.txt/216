<L>__{exterior ring, round four, five, six foreman barrage}
<A>__{ali is braced on the ropes, as far back as the ropes will go. foreman throws a barrage of shots, he slams in five and six at a time. the bell.}
<B>__{ali}
<A>__{covers with gloves at his head. elbows at his ribs. when head shots come in, ali slips them the right or left, or turns them into glancing shots, or just leans straight back so that they all fall short by quarter of an inch. the bell.}
<B>__{ali}
<A>__{covering, taking the most powerful hooks foreman's thrown in the fight, one after the other to the body.}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{take it! terrify him with what you can take...}
<A>__{ali's eyes are stars. he sees everything. he sees things no one else can see in the quantum physics of deflecting the force of foreman's blows.}
<B>__{foreman}
<A>__{desperate, pounds a left to ali's side, a blocked left to the head, three lefts to the belly, which get through! ali's left arm convulses downwards, involuntarily, with the blows. what ali's not ready for and doesn't block is the right hand that follows. this shot is jarring and concussive. he grabs foreman's neck and has to hold on. the bell.}
