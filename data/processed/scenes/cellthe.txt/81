<L>__{interior stargher's world}
<A>__{clouds hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with hills. three identical women sit on black earth, their bodies positioned in a uniform pattern. pull back to reveal novak at their feet, in a kneeling fetal position, face down in the gritty soil, a piece of cloth draped over his head. with difficulty, practically inhaling black grit, novak breathes deeply and rises to his knees. his hand moves to his face and he's briefly astounded by the texture of the gravel, the sharpness of it against his face. removing the shroud like cloth, he looks at the soil, smells it, tastes it.}
<C>__{mother one }
<D>__{have you seen him?}
<A>__{novak finds the first of the three visions of stargher's mother addressing him. she, like the other two, speaks in a ghostly monotone, nearly devoid of emotion.}
<C>__{mother one }
<D>__{my boy, my little one. his father took him from me. have you seen him?}
<A>__{as she continues, almost mantra like, woman two begins:}
<C>__{mother two}
<P>__{(similar monotone)}
<D>__{my child is an abomination. he is damned. he has no soul.}
<A>__{the women's repetitive "monologues" overlap. aurual layers now added by three.}
<C>__{mother three}
<D>__{me god me boy. me god good son.}
<A>__{novak takes a moment to absorb his surroundings. the sights, sounds and feel of the place. like being within a dream. as he backs away from the odd quartet, shimmering light dances across his face. shading his eyes. novak searches for the source. opposite him, across the valley, is a sheer rock wall. a massive cliff face pockmarked with rough "windows." like a star, the light sparkles inside one of them, a fragment of mirror reflecting a beam away from novak's face to a path cutting across the valley floor to the base of the wall. the light guiding him, novak follows the path and starts to climb, finding stairs or ladders, passing deep, seemingly infinite passages. like tombs, or the "drawers" of a mausoleum. deep within one of them, the light flickers. fades. and novak crawls into darkness.}
