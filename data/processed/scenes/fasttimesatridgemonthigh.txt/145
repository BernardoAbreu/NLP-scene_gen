<L>__{interior ridgemont gymnasium night}
<A>__{tight angle on the emotion filled face of the lead singer in a cheesy high school band called the t birds. he is bathed in a blue light, singing the last verse of the eagles' 'take it to the limit'. we pull back to reveal a large, clumsy banner reading: last dance. students are pouring into the gym for this event. many have brought their annual yearbooks. on stage, the lead singer snaps his fingers and the band goes into nick lowe's 'heart of the city'. some students start to dance. every one of our characters is either here, or about to arrive. from charles jefferson to spicoli to mr. hand. for once, all classes are partying together. but, just as in the beginning of the year on lunch court, the kids are still cordoned off into their distinctive cliques.}

<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{hey, mon. sign my annual.}
<A>__{spicoli slips the annual into the kid's crotch. the stoner winces in pain, but still opens the book and lingers on all the signings in spicoli's annual. they are all drug related messages from fellow stoners. after a moment, spicoli's friend signs: "thanks for the reds. todd."}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{hey, mon, good thing we're going to mexico this summer. 'cause you're gonna get kicked out of your house when your parents read your annual.}
