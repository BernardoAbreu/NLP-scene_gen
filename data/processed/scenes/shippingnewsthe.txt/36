<L>__{interior gammy bird morning}
<A>__{quoyle enters. billy pretty's on the phone, hand cupped over the receiver, like it's top secret. nutbeem's tuning his ancient shortwave with a butter knife through the hole where a knob ought to be. and as quoyle sets down his sack lunch and thermos, as he peels off his parka, he's staring straight into the eyes of... ...tert card across the way. wearing a wicked and mysterious smile. as quoyle's butt lowers toward his chair...}
<C>__{booming voice }
<D>__{attention quoyle!}
<A>__{ouoyle jumps a foot. looks from card to billy to nutbeem. what's going on?}
<C>__{booming voice }
<D>__{it's an i.q. test, me old son, and you ain't excelling!}
<A>__{whips around. through the glass of the only private office, sits a rumpled codger with a bullhorn. jack buggit, has his rubber boots up on the desk, scale spattered overalls over his compact, sinewy body. his hair is wisps and shocks, and his face is strewn with stubble split by a leprechaun's grin around a stained hand rolled ciggie.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{does payin' yer shameful wage entitle me to a personal audience? or wouldja rather just stand there an' drool?}
<C>__{nutbeem}
<D>__{tell the truth.}
<A>__{jack waving him in, with great energetic loops. the grin more rowdy than his boy's. but the charm is there and more so. quoyle goes...}
<C>__{card }
<D>__{hold onto yer danglies, little sister.}
<A>__{...closes the door behind him. jack's eyes are crinkly blue. they study quoyle good. and right in his face...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i predict! a cockadoodle bright future in journalism!}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{based on my i.q. test, huh. where'd i rate?}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{advanced squirrel. this ties you with me, an' i own the place.}
<A>__{holds out a brown fisherman's hand. quoyle takes it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{pleased t'meetcha, billy says yer workin' out.}
<A>__{a wink.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{tert card says he's keepin' an eye on ya. since he's a self servin' liar, helluva ad salesman tho, it means he's jealous. and nutbeem...}
<A>__{lifts the bullhorn...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{nutbeem's temporary anyway! you hear that nutbeem!}
<P>__{nutbeem (o.s., through glass)}
<D>__{with profound relief!}
<A>__{jack's grin grows a twinkle. soft spot for the brit.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{nutbeem's obsessed with actual news. makes up for it by manning the sexual abuse desk. can't keep up with the volume there, we're runnin' three, four a week.}
<A>__{leans forward. like he's dishing the lowdown.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{card's in charge. ya hear this and that 'bout his typos, but typos is part of gammy bird. everyone gets a laugh, and gets to figger 'em out. better'n a crossword.}
<A>__{stabs out his cigarette. pulls a new one from a damp little box.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{an' billy. well, billy's a writer and a fisherman. me, i'm just a fisherman.}
<A>__{offers the box. quoyle shakes him off.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fishin' and the sea is all i am. my pap the same. my boy.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{so he said. waitin' for his license.}
<A>__{ah. jack's smile doesn't actually fade. but the eyes flicker, and quoyle is sorry he opened his yap.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{naw, my boy's passed. went to sea and there he rests. bless his bones.}
<A>__{his glance goes to a photo. jack and a strapping blond son. not dennis, that's for sure. somehow, we are suddenly down to business...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{want two things from ya, quoyle. first. you cover every local car wreck, take pictures. front page photo every week, whether we have a wreck or not, an' we always do. when we don't, we dip into card's file, he's got some beauties.}
