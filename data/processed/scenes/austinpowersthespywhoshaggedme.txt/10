<A>__{european types stare and pointerior we see austin from behind. his bottom half is blocked by a bicycle. the bicycle moves away. just as austin's bum is about to be revealed a credit appears blocking it. austin turns his head around to the camera and puts his hand to his mouth in an 'oh my!' take and we freeze frame. a man in a raincoat flashes austin, his thingy blocked by a credit. austin just laughs...crazy, man! austin goes around a corner. a moment later he returns, followed by a nude marching band. a sign on the left side of the screen reads "warning! nude beach". austin enters from the left. we see his naked, hairy torso from the waist up. just as he is about to appear from behind the sign, a... credit appears moving left to right blocking his penis lengthwise as he walks. nude beach credit sequence a girl sits on a blanket; a horizontal credit blocks her bare chest. austin lays on his back beside her, trying to be suave; a vertical credit appears. the wind blows away a kite, revealing a stark naked girl. the credit "production design" blocks her chest; the credit "by" blocks her you know what. austin walks into frame; the "production designer's name" disguises his growing interest. austin joins a nude volleyball game in progress. credits appear everywhere to block all possible combinations of nudity. people leap in all directions to make saves, causing credits to appear at crazy angles. a pretty girl watches austin lift weights. her boobs are blocked by the "written by" credit. austin lifts a dumbbell. the credit "mike myers" sticks out from his waist. austin looks proud. a buff naked bodybuilder joins them. he lifts a much heavier weight. a much longer credit sticks out from his waist: "and michael mccullers". austin pouts. austin runs down the beach, his bum blocked by the credit "directed by". he jumps on a trampoline and does the splits in mid air: freeze frame and pan around like in the gap "khaki swing" ad. austin smiles crazily, his penis blocked by "jay roach." austin does a super duper double flip into his jaguar.}

<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{ok. i have a vestigial tail.}
<A>__{everyone is a little grossed out.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{it's more of a nub, really. the spine just goes on a little longer than it should. also, i've dabbled. i mean, perform fellatio once and you're a poet, twice and you're a homosexual. i remember once i was being fisted by sebastian cabot but here's where the story gets interesting. he was lactose intolerant. he could eat red meat all night long, but one sip of milk and it was gastric hell. and i remember we were caught in fragrance delicto by henry kissinger, and you can imagine my humiliation at having hank hear me say, "mr. french, no teeth." one of my greatest disappointments is that i never became a song and dance man. i could have been a quadruple threat, kind of like a despotic ken barry. dancer, singer, actor, and i would possess nuclear weapons, the latter being the most threatening of the four. i once sat on a bus and tried to will myself a menstrual cycle. all i ended up with was a sense of failure and a mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth and perhaps a grudging respect for the weaker sex. i love toe cleavage. for the most part i distrust dogs. i slept in a horse once. it was quite roomy. on second thought, it was the ritz. i named my left testicle 'piss' and my right testicle 'vinegar'. i wrote "it's raining men", or so the christmas babies told me. oh yes, i also made a marzipan voodoo effigy of the fonze while i was in coma after smoking some peruvian prayer hash, but who at the end of the day can honestly say they haven't done that?}
