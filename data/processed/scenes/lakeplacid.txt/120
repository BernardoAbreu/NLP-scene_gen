<D>__{let's get ready.}
<A>__{hector's chopper, cow dangling, is slowly approaching the shore. behind it... the snout and eyes of a giant croc. back on the shore, keough's men ready themselves for action. tranq guns. rifles... the team is mobilized. we hear a distressed cry from the cow.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{he's mooing.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you wouldn't?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{they're coming right in.}
<C>__{kelly}

<C>__{keough}

<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(into walkie talkie)}
<D>__{almost here, hector. don't forget to lift up the cow.}
<C>__{hector }
<P>__{(sarcastic, through walkie talkie)}
<D>__{thank you, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to the team)}
<D>__{you shoot on my order. if he charges, i will be yelling "go" which means drivers take off. and drive fast, they can move on land.}
<P>__{(to keough)}
<D>__{you set?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{don't worry about me.}
<A>__{incredibly... the plan is working. a giant dragon is following a dangled suspended cow to the shoreline. hector dangles the cow closer, they're now nearing shore. the big crocodile, eyes on the prize, is moving in for the flank steak. the time is now.}
