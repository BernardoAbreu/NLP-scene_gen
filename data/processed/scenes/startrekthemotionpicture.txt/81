<A>__{sulu hits a control viewer seems to zoom ahead and in the distance we see a point of light which grows into the luminescent cloud. the same as seen by the klingons and starfleet's epsilon nine station. myster ious, beautiful, and menacing.}

<C>__{decker}
<D>__{that measures twelve power? ten thousands of starships couldn't generate that much...}
<A>__{decker trails his words, realizing that spock isn't hearing a word. spock's attention is on the o.s. main viewer, totally absorbed by something he's feeling. he is slowly rising from his seat, stepping forward kirk becomes conscious of this, turns and sees spock's strange expression. before he can speak:}
<C>__{spock}
