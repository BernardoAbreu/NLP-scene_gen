<L>__{exterior halfway house porch. day}
<A>__{kym, a darkly beautiful girl in her early 20's, is smoking furiously on the porch of an urban halfway house. she glances impatiently at her watch and presses her ear to her cell phone. as she exhales, we hear the rumble of thunder. irritated, she crams her cell phone into her bag. rosa a halfway house staff nurse is patiently handling walter, an irate patient who is screeching...}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i want my fucking zippo now!}
<A>__{walter starts yanking at his hair.}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{walter, that is a behavior...}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(raking his nails against his forearm)}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{and you are making a choice.}
<A>__{her cell phone rings...}
<C>__{rosa}
<P>__{(to walter)}
<D>__{hold on...hello?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{god!}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{don't you get it yet, waldo? she's making a choice not to give you your lighter because you'll torch the self help library again.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i'm walter. kill anybody recently? run anybody over with a fucking car?}
<A>__{kym grinds her cigarette under her heel and blows smoke but gives no signal that she's heard anything. she yanks her cell phone out of her bag as... a tan mercedes station wagon pulls up in front of the house.}
<C>__{rosa}
<P>__{(to kym)}
<D>__{that them?}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{yes. finally.}
<A>__{rosa takes two of kym's several bags. they are oddly matched. a coach tote, a fake prada, a gristedes bag, and a world wildlife fund tote bag.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you're not letting her get behind the wheel are you? are you?}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{walter, you are only responsible for yourself. (to kym) this is all your stuff?}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{you know you never gave me your cell number.}
<C>__{rosa}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{it was a mistake. i'm lucky i didn't get fired. we've discussed this. (she offers her hand) good luck.}
<A>__{kym doesn't appear to have heard her but she shakes the hand barely... so very, very faintly. kym's dad, paul buchman, a tired, prosperous man in his late}
<L>__{50's steps around the car and trots up the porch steps. he is}
<A>__{wearing a big smile and his glasses are foggy. they hug. kym talks rapidly over his shoulder...}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{oh my god. here you are. i thought you were going to abandon me in rehab. it's 12:30. you guys are half an hour late. i've been standing here with these lunatics. you look so great.}
<A>__{paul offers his hand to rosa.}
<C>__{paul}

<D>__{of course, of course.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{let's go, let's go. where is everybody?}
<A>__{carol, a handsome woman in her 40's, waves from the car.}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{hey carol. how are ya?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{hello kym.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{so where's rachel? carol, where's rachel?}
<A>__{kym slides into the back seat as paul loads the car.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{getting everything ready at the house.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{there is so much going on at the house i can't tell you. you know your sister's doing all of it herself.}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(eyeing the rearview}
<D>__{mirror as she arranges}
<P>__{her bangs)}
<D>__{my sister is bending the environment to her will? really?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no wedding planners or anything like that. just her and sidney and a lot of their friends. she is so thrilled you're here. is that everything, sweetheart?}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(distractedly, rifling through her bag)}
<D>__{yah. can we go?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{is there anyone you want to say goodbye to?}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{god no.}
<L>__{exterior interior transitional shots. day}
<A>__{the station wagon travels through a constantly changing series of environments as they journey out of new york city on their drive to suburban connecticut. right away though, kym lights up a cigarette and paul and carol crank their windows.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{so are all these busy young wedding helpers staying at the house? because after eight months of constantly revolving cell mates and crazy people...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you weren't in a cell, kym...}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{...and groups groups groups...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{...and nobody was crazy, nobody was in a rubber room...}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{...i was looking forward to a little privacy for once.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{the only extra person staying at the house is emma, who's actually been staying in your old room. but she can move, i guess.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{rachel and emma. oh, great. how relaxing.}
<C>__{kym }
<D>__{the only two people on the planet less capable of delegating than hannibal! on the eve of a wedding! nachtmare.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{nachtmare?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's a nightmare so bad it's in german.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{rachel must be totally freaking out. is she too tense?...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{she's a wigwam!}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(right on top of him,}
<D>__{rifling through her bag}
<P>__{again)}
<D>__{...is she eating? or are all her latent food issues rearing their heads? is she hoarding snickers and cool whip under the bed like in high school? she never did put that one to sleep.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(genuine)}
<D>__{i don't think that that's a problem for her.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{no offense, dad, but you never thought that was a problem for her. i'm kidding. it'll be great to see her. foodies are the worst, though. they never get it together. there were six of them on my floor in the hospital and you could never get into the bathroom. they would cry at the chocolate pudding and one of them was a guy. i can't wait to see mom.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you'll see her and andrew at the rehearsal dinner tonight.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{can we stop at the 7 11 please? i feel nauseous. i need something to drink.}
<C>__{carol}

<L>__{exterior the buchman house. day.}
<A>__{the station wagon pulls into a circular driveway lined with trees and bushes of beautiful blue hydrangea. there are several late model cars parked in the driveway of the sprawling, shingled house. young people crawling everywhere in the midst of wedding preparation, wrapping garlands and hanging paper lanterns. a little girl tosses rose petals in the swimming pool. the atmosphere is slightly punch drunk and friendly. paul unloads kym's bags.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{i will do it, dad.}
<A>__{she doesn't.}
<L>__{interior buchman living room. day.}
<A>__{kym charges into the house where norman sklear and more friends of rachel are decorating. they stare at her as she runs up the stairs to the second floor. camera runs all the}

<D>__{i have pins all over me. you look great!}
<C>__{kym}

<D>__{kym!}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{emma!}
<P>__{(to rachel)}
<D>__{no seriously, you're so tiny it's like you're asian. dad wants us to sleep in the same room so you'll be able to watch me while he's asleep and i won't sneak out of the house and blow dealers and shoot heroin.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{dad did not say "blow dealers."}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{i told him i'd just sleep in ethan's room.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you can always shoot up in the tree house.}

<D>__{kym, i'm not remotely surprised you're starting your drama already, however it's rachel's wedding and this week it's about her.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{emma, you still have your tiny core of rage! what a relief.}
<A>__{kym flops on the bed and gazes adoringly at her sister for a moment. rachel beams back.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{so are you an actual shrink yet? even though you're like twelve years old?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{psychology. not psychiatry. you know the difference, right?}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{you should prescribe something soothing for emma. like vicodin.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i will have my phd. in a year and a half. and psychologists don't get prescription pads, right kym?}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{they do in guam.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{would you please put that out? emma designed this dress and there's forty seven yards of it and i will go up like the hindenburg.}
<A>__{kym takes a last drag even though she's down to the filter, then flushes the butt down the toilet in the tiny bathroom.}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(over the flushing toilet)}
<D>__{since when are you a designer, emma?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{a while.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{she has this great little boutique in greenwich. she says things like "you need a fabulous jersey pant."}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{that's so great. i think i heard that. isn't this your fifth incarnation or something? weren't you an actress? all the n.e.d.'s in the hospital were actresses...}

<C>__{emma}
<D>__{elvis stoyko the figure skater?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{in her fantasy, she was wearing her hair up and very serious, responsible eyeglasses, because she was a world renowned judge at the winter olympics for men's figure skating. and elvis stoyko was skating in the finals to "could it be magic" for the gold medal. and just when barry manilow is singing "now now now and hold on fast..." there's this electric connection between them and he stops in the middle of his triple lutz...axel...}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{and he skates over to the judges table, all panting and sweaty, with his spangly neil diamond shirt open to the chest...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{there is silence as he stops in front of her, their eyes lock, and he reaches for her hand... and angela takes it!}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{to the roar of the crowd and the shock of the olympic judges!}
<C>__{kym }
<D>__{and he pulls her out of her chair, undoes her hair, and they skate as a pair to the rest of the song!}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and he gets disqualified but he doesn't care!}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{where'd she get the skates from?}
<A>__{they collapse in laughter. kym studies her ass in the mirror.}
<C>__{kym}
