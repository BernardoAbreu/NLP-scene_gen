<L>__{interior olive's bedroom dusk}
<A>__{the sun is setting as olive speaks into her webcam. but this time, we're not seeing it through the lens, but from a different point in the room.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{and here you all are. waiting outside the closet door for me to kiss todd, listening to me pretend to have sex with brandon, paying me to lie for you, calling probably the last virgin in school a whore. guys. seriously.}
<A>__{all of a sudden from outside and downstairs james' `laid' begins to play. olive goes over to the window and sees todd below, holding up a boombox (a la john cusack) and there's a ride on lawn mower (a la patrick dempsey) behind him. upon seeing this, she bursts into laughter, but it couldn't be more romantic.}

<P>__{(shouting down)}
<D>__{who told you that i loved this song?}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<P>__{(shouting up)}
<D>__{i guessed.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i see you've been watching my live webcast. it's still going on, you know.}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{fuck them. they've had enough of you. well, figuratively speaking. i borrowed my neighbor's john deere. come down here.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{that rhymed.}
<C>__{meerkat todd}
<D>__{intentionally.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{be right down.}
<A>__{olive can't get the smile off of her face as she goes back to the camera. we see her through the lens.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{that's todd. not that i owe any of you any more confessions, but i'm really in love with him. and i am going to lose my virginity to him. i'm not sure when. it could happen five minutes from now or tonight or six months from now or maybe on our wedding night, but the really amazing thing is that it's nobody's business.}
<P>__{(as an afterthought)}
<D>__{like, totally.}
<A>__{she turns the camera off.}
