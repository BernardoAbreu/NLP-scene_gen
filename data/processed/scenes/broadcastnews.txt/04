<D>__{...that was, of course, not meant to be taken seriously. a personal note. i am frequently asked what the special difficulties are in being graduated from high school two months shy of my fifteenth birthday. i sometimes think it was the difficulties themselves which enabled me to do it. if i'd been appreciated or even tolerated i wouldn't have been in such a hurry to graduate. i hope the next student who comes along and is able to excel isn't made to feel so much an outcast. but i'm looking forward to college; this is the happiest day i've had in a long time. i thank you and i forgive you.}
