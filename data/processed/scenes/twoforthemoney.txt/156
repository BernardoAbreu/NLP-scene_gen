<A>__{(to brandon, re: walter) look at him. dead man walking, should be getting last rites. hours away from losing everything, but walter he's having the time of his life.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{maybe he thinks he already did lose everything. wall of tvs, the ball's kicked and the game begins the salesroom explodes in cheers after a good play players collide a fumble bounces across the field salesmen clamber atop desks for a better view walter in agony after an interception, a moment later elated when a flag brings the play back the score board fills frame, new york trails 14 7 at the half and pull back to show the tension level in the room is suddenly suspended. we're in the eye of the storm. walter like a fighter between rounds. brandon appears.}
