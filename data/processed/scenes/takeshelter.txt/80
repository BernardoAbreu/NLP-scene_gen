<A>__{as samantha talks to the teacher, curtis looks over flashcards with hannah. he signs "sunshine", a circle in the sky with the hand then coming down, fingers spread. i e. samantha's car interstate night curtis drives while samantha and hannah sleep in the back. surrounding farmland drops quickly into darkness joining a purple sky in the distance. through the passenger window, a streak of lightning breaks across the horizon. then another. curtis, seeing this, repositions to get a better look through the window. it's horizontal lightning that appears to leap from cloud to cloud. well defined bolts that strobe the night sky silhouetting towering thunderheads. curtis looks back to samantha and hannah, still asleep. he pulls the car over to the shoulder of the interstate and continues watching. he climbs out. on the shoulder of the interstate, cars rush by as curtis gently closes the car door. keeping his eyes on the lightning storm, he walks to the shoulder. it's a fantastic display of light. hurried and intense. a bolt of lightning reaches down to the ground. sparks pop off the earth in the distance. another bolt streaks down, getting closer. curtis sees the traffic continuing to pass by at full speed.}
<C>__{curtis}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{is anyone seeing this?}
<A>__{curtis walks to the back window of the car and sees samantha sleeping inside. he reaches out to knock but stops himself. he turns back to the lightning and watches.}
