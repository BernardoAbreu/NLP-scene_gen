<L>__{interior coffee shop morning}
<A>__{a normal denny's, spires like coffee shop in los angeles. it's about 9:00 in the morning. while the place isn't jammed, there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and eating eggs. two of these people are a young man and a young woman. the young man has a slight working class english accent and, like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're going out of style. it is impossible to tell where the young woman is from or how old she is; everything she does contradicts something she did. the boy and girl sit in a booth. their dialogue is to be said in a rapid pace "his girl friday" fashion.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{no, forget it, it's too risky. i'm through doin' that shit.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{you always say that, the same thing every time: never again, i'm through, too dangerous.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{i know that's what i always say. i'm always right too, but}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{but you forget about it in a day or two }
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days of me rememberin' have just begun.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{when you go on like this, you know what you sound like?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{i sound like a sensible fucking man, is what i sound like.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{you sound like a duck.}
<P>__{(imitates a duck)}
<D>__{quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack...}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. because since i'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how i'm never gonna do it again.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{after tonight.}
<A>__{the boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in there, back and forth.}
<C>__{young man}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{correct. i got all tonight to quack.}
<A>__{a waitress comes by with a pot of coffee.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{can i get anybody anymore coffee?}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{oh yes, thank you.}
<A>__{the waitress pours the young woman's coffee. the young man lights up another cigarette.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{i'm doin' fine.}
<A>__{the waitress leaves. the young man takes a drag off of his smoke. the young woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her coffee. the young man goes right back into it.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{i mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. you take more of a risk. banks are easier! federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. they're insured, why should they care? you don't even need a gun in a federal bank. i heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said: "we got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er."}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{did it work?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{fuckin' a it worked, that's what i'm talkin' about! knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a fuckin' finger.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{did they hurt the little girl?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{i don't know. there probably never was a little girl the point of the story isn't the little girl. the point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{you wanna rob banks?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{i'm not sayin' i wanna rob banks, i'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{so you don't want to be a bank robber?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin' twenty.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{and no more liquor stores?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{what have we been talking about? yeah, no more liquor stores. besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. too many foreigners own liquor stores. vietnamese, koreans, they can't fuckin' speak english. you tell 'em: "empty out the register," and they don't know what it fuckin' means. they make it too personal. we keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{i'm not gonna kill anybody.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{i don't wanna kill anybody either. but they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them. and if it's not the gooks, it these old jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations. ya got grandpa irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' magnum. try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. fuck it, forget it, we're out of it.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{well, what else is there, day jobs?}
<C>__{young man}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{not this life.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{well what then?}
<A>__{he calls to the waitress.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{garcon! coffee!}
<A>__{then looks to his girl.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{this place.}
<A>__{the waitress comes by, pouring him some more.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(snotty)}
<D>__{"garcon" means boy.}
<A>__{she splits.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{here? it's a coffee shop.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{what's wrong with that? people never rob restaurants, why not? bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them. restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. they're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting.}
<C>__{young woman}
<P>__{(taking to idea)}
<D>__{i bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{correct. just like banks, these places are insured. the managers don't give a fuck, they're just tryin' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin' diners. waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a bullet for the register. busboys, some wetback gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner. customers are sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on. one minute they're havin' a denver omelet, next minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their face.}
<A>__{the young woman visibly takes in the idea. the young man continues in a low voice.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{see, i got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. 'member all those customers kept comin' in?}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{then you got the idea to take everybody's wallet.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{that was a good idea.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{we made more from the wallets then we did the register.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{yes we did.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{a lot of people go to restaurants.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{a lot of wallets.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{pretty smart, huh?}
<A>__{the young woman scans the restaurant with this new information. she sees all the patrons eating, lost in conversations. the tired waitress, taking orders. the busboys going through the motions, collecting dishes. the manager complaining to the cook about something. a smiles breaks out on the young woman's face.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{pretty smart.}
<P>__{(into it)}
<D>__{i'm ready, let's go, right here, right now.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{remember, same as before, you're crowd control, i handle the employees.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{got it.}
<A>__{they both take out their .32 caliber pistols and lay them on the table. he looks at her and she back at him.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{i love you, pumpkin.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{i love you, honey bunny.}
<A>__{and with that, pumpkin and honey bunny grab their weapons, stand up and rob the restaurant. pumpkin's robbery persona is that of the in control professional. honey bunny's is that of the psychopathic, hair triggered, loose cannon.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<P>__{(yelling to all)}
<D>__{everybody be cool this is a robbery!}
<C>__{honey bunny}

<C>__{jules}
<D>__{those are hash bars?}
<C>__{vincent}

<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{well, the way they pick the shows on tv is they make one show, and that show's called a pilot. and they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows. some get accepted and become tv programs, and some don't, and become nothing. she starred in one of the ones that became nothing.}

<C>__{jules}
<D>__{it ain't no ballpark either. look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin' his lady's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport. foot massages don't mean shit.}

<A>__{they move a little away from the door, facing each other, still whispering.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{look, just because i wouldn't give no man a foot massage, don't make it right for marsellus to throw antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. that ain't right, man. motherfucker do that to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause i'd kill'a motherfucker.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i'm not sayin' he was right, but you're sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothing, and i'm sayin' it does. i've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'. we act like they don't, but they do. that's what's so fuckin' cool about 'em. this sensual thing's goin' on that nobody's talkin about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin' marsellus knew it, and antwan shoulda known fuckin' better. that's his fuckin' wife, man. he ain't gonna have a sense of humor about that shit.}

<D>__{knives. the character i played, raven mccoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. so she grew up doing a knife act. according to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife. but because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat. she could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist when you're keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artist's gonna come in handy. and she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her. if we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode i woulda told and ol joke.}

<C>__{mia}
<D>__{don't you hate that?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{uncomfortable silences. why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{that's when you know you found somebody special. when you can just shit the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i don't think we're there yet. but don't feel bad, we just met each other.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{well i will tell you what, i will go to the bathroom and powder my nose, while you sit here and think of something to say.}

<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{we're lucky we got it at all. buddy holly doesn't seem to be much of a waiter. we shoulda sat in marilyn monroe's section.}

<D>__{pretty smart.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i have moments.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{did ya think of something to say?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{actually, there's something i've wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and i didn't want to offend you.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like mindless, boring, getting to know you chit chat. this sounds like you actually have something to say.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{only if you promise not to get offended.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{you can't promise something like that. i have no idea what you're gonna ask. you could ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended. then, through no fault of my own, i woulda broken my promise.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{then let's just forget it.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{that is an impossibility. trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.}
<C>__{vincent}

<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{tony rocky horror.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{he fell out of a window.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{that's one way to say it. another way is, he was thrown out. another was is, he was thrown out by marsellus. and even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by marsellus because of you.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{is that a fact?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{no it's not, it's just what i heard.}

<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{they certainly do.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{well don't by shy vincent, what exactly did they say?}
<A>__{vincent is slow to answer.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{let me help you bashful, did it involve the f word?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{no. they just said rocky horror gave you a foot massage.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{and...?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{no and, that's it.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{you heard marsellus threw rocky horror out of a four story window because he massaged my feet?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{and you believed that?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{at the time i was told, it seemed reasonable.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{marsellus throwing tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{no, it seemed excessive. but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. i heard marsellus is very protective of you.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{a husband being protective of his wife is one thing. a husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{but did it happen?}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{the only thing antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. i met anwan once at my wedding then never again. the truth is, nobody knows why marsellus tossed tony rocky horror out of that window except marsellus and tony rocky horror. but when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.}

<A>__{everything seems normal. more or less the right number of cars in the street. none of the parked cars appear out of place. none of them have a couple of goons sitting inside. basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of butch's home. butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information. butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. he crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard. across the street from butch's building, on the corner, is a combination donut shop and japanese restaurant. a big sign sticks up in the air, with the name "teriyaki donut" and a graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.}
<L>__{exterior butch's apartment courtyard day}
<A>__{butch is in the courtyard of his north hollywood apartment building. once again, everything appears normal the laundry room, the pool, his apartment door nothing appears disturbed. butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. he steps outside the door and listens inside. nothing. butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it.}
<L>__{interior butch's apartment day}
<A>__{his apartment hasn't been touched. he cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick look around. obviously, no one is there. butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator. he takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it. with carton in hard, butch surveys the apartment. then he goes to the bedroom. his bedroom is like the rest of the apartment neat, clean and anonymous. the only things personal in his room are a few boxing trophies, an olympic silver medal, a framed issue of "ring magazine" with butch on the cover, and a poster of jerry quarry and one of george chuvalo. sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: on the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue. he walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. he opens a cupboard and takes out a box of pop tarts. putting down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two pop tarts and puts them in the toaster. butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something. what he sees is a small compact czech m61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.}

<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<A>__{he picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines it. then... a toilet flushes. butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the kitchen. there is someone behind it. like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, butch freezes, not knowing what to do. the bathroom door opens and vincent vega steps out of the bathroom, tightening his belt. in his hand is the book "modesty blaise" by peter o'donnell. vincent and butch lock eyes. vincent freezes. butch doesn't move, except to point the m61 in vincent's direction. neither man opens his mouth. then... the toaster loudly kicks up the pop tarts. that's all the situation needed. butch's finger hits the trigger. muffled fire shoots out of the end of the gun. vincent is seemingly wracked with twenty bullets simultaneously lifting him off his feet, propelling him through the air and crashing through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom. by the time butch removes his finger from the trigger, vincent is annihilated. butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. his look goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip. with the respect it deserves, butch carefully places the m61 back on the kitchen counter. then he exits the apartment, quickly.}

<A>__{the gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black leather bondage gear. there are zippers, buckles and studs here and there on the body. on his head is a black leather mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. they keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large dog. zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, then lowers into it. maynard hands the gimp's leash to zed, then backs away.}

<A>__{zed grabs marsellus' chair and drags him into russell's old room. russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the misfortune of stumbling into the mason dixie pawnshop. whatever happened to russell is known only to maynard and zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty. as marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with butch before he disappears behind the door of russell's old room.}

<A>__{the gimp flails wildly, trying to get the leash off the hook. he tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and grunts. butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three boxer's punches to its face. the punches knock the gimp out, making him fall to his knees, this hanging himself by the leash attached to the hook, butch removes the ball gag, then silently makes his way through the red curtains.}

<C>__{butch}
<D>__{hey hillbilly.}
<A>__{maynard turns and sees butch holding the sword. butch screams... with one mighty swing, slashes maynard across the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on zed. maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock. butch, while never taking his eyes off zed, thrusts the sword behind him, skewering maynard, then extracts it, pointing the blade toward zed. maynard collapses. zed disengages from marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the tip of butch's sword to marsellus' .45 automatic, which lies within reach. butch's eyes follow zed's.}

<D>__{i gotta take a shit. to be continued.}
<A>__{vincent exits for the restroom. jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... pumpkin and honey bunny rise with guns raised.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{everybody be cool, this is a robbery!}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{any of you fuckin' pricks move and i will execute every one of you motherfuckers! got that?!}
<A>__{jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. under the table, jules' hand goes to his .45 automatic. he pulls it out, cocking it.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{customers stay seated, waitresses on the floor.}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{now mean fuckin' now! do it or die, do it or fucking die!}
<A>__{like lightning, pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. while honey bunny screams out threats to the patrons, keeping them terrified.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{you mexicans in the kitchen, get out here! asta luego!}
<A>__{three cooks and two busboys come out of the kitchen.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{on the floor or i will cook you ass, comprende?}
<A>__{they comprende. the portly manager speaks up.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i'm the manager here, there's no problem, no problem at all}
<A>__{pumpkin heads his way.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{you're gonna give me a problem?}
<A>__{he reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the manager's neck.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{what? you said you're gonna give me a problem?}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{no, i'm not. i'm not gonna give you any problem!}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{i don't know, honey bunny. he looks like the hero type to me!}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{don't take any chances. execute him!}
<A>__{the patrons scream. jules watches all this silently, his hand tightly gripping the .45 automatic under the table.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{please don't! i'm not a hero. i'm just a coffee shop manager. take anything you want.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{tell everyone to cooperate and it'll be all over.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{everybody just be calm and cooperate with them and this will be all over soon!}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{well done, now git your fuckin' ass on the ground.}
<L>__{interior coffee shop bathroom morning}
<A>__{vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside, reads his "modesty blaise" book.}
<L>__{interior coffee shop morning}
<A>__{cash register drawer opens. pumpkin stuffs the money from the till in his pocket. then walks from behind the counter with a trash bag in his hand.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{okay people, i'm going to go 'round and collect your wallets. don't talk, just toss 'em in the bag. we clear?}
<A>__{pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. jules sits with his .45 ready to spit under the table. pumpkin sees jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, briefcase next to him. pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more respectful, him manner more on guard.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{in the bag.}
<A>__{jules drops his wallet in the bag. using his gun as a pointer, pumpkin points to the briefcase.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{what's in that?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{my boss' dirty laundry.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{you boss makes you do his laundry?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{when he wants it clean.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{sounds like a shit job.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{funny, i've been thinkin' the same thing.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{open it up.}
<A>__{jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{'fraid i can't do that.}
<A>__{pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. he aims the gun right in the middle of jules' face and pulls back the hammer.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{i didn't hear you.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{yes, you did.}
<A>__{this exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard it, but honey bunny senses something's wrong.}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{what's goin' on?}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{shoot 'em in the face!}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i don't mean to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time i've had gun pointed at me.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{you don't open up that case, it's gonna be the last.}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(on the ground)}
<D>__{quit causing problems, you'll get us all killed! give 'em what you got and get 'em out of here.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat man, this ain't any of your goddamn business!}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{i'm countin' to three, and if your hand ain't off that case, i'm gonna unload right in your fuckin' face. clear? one...}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{...two... three.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{you win.}
<A>__{jules raises his hand off the briefcase.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{it's all yours, ringo.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{open it.}
<A>__{jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to pumpkin but not to us. the same light shines from the case. pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. honey bunny, across the room, can't see shit.}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{what is it? what is it?}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{is that what i think it is?}
<A>__{jules nods his head: "yes."}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{it's beautiful.}
<A>__{jules nods his head: "yes."}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{goddammit, what is it?}
<A>__{jules slams the case closed, then sits back, as if offering the case to pumpkin. pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to pick up the case. like a rattlesnake, jules' free hand grabs the wrist of pumpkin's gun hand, slamming it on the table. his other hand comes from under the table and sticks the barrel of his .45 hand under pumpkin's chin. honey bunny freaks out, waving her gun in jules' direction.}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{let him go! let him go! i will blow your fuckin' head off! i will kill ya! i will kill ya! you're gonna die, you're gonna fuckin' die bad!}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(to pumpkin)}
<D>__{tell that bitch to be cool! say, bitch be cool! say, bitch be cool!}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{chill out, honey!}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{let him go!}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{tell her it's gonna be okay.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{i'm gonna be okay.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{promise her.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{i promise.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{tell her to chill.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{just chill out.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{what's her name?}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{yolanda.}
<A>__{whenever jules talks to yolanda, he never looks at her, only at pumpkin.}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(to yolanda)}
<D>__{so, we cool yolanda? we ain't gonna do anything stupid, are we?}
<C>__{yolanda}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{don't you hurt him.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{nobody's gonna hurt anybody. we're gonna be like three fonzies. and what' fonzie like?}
<A>__{no answer.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{c'mon yolanda, what's fonzie like?}
<C>__{yolanda}
<P>__{(through tears, unsure)}
<D>__{he's cool?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{correct amundo! and that's what we're gonna be, we're gonna be cool.}
<P>__{(to pumpkin)}
<D>__{now ringo, i'm gonna count to three and i want you to let go your gun and lay your palms flat on the table. but when you do it, do it cool. ready?}
<A>__{pumpkin looks at him.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{one... two... three.}
<A>__{pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table. yolanda can't stand it anymore.}
<C>__{yolanda}
<D>__{okay, now let him go!}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{yolanda, i thought you were gonna be cool. when you yell at me, it makes me nervous. when i get nervous, i get scared. and when motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers get accidentally shot.}
<C>__{yolanda}
<P>__{(more conversational)}
<D>__{just know: you hurt him, you die.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{that seems to be the situation. now i don't want that and you don't want that and ringo here don't want that. so let's see what we can do.}
<P>__{(to ringo)}
<D>__{now this is the situation. normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken. but you happened to pull this shit while i'm in a transitional period. i don't wanna kill ya, i want to help ya. but i'm afraid i can't give you the case. it don't belong to me. besides, i went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass.}
<C>__{vincent }
<D>__{what the fuck's goin' on here?}
<A>__{yolanda whips her gun toward the stranger. vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead aimed at yolanda.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{it's cool, vincent! it's cool! don't do a goddamn thing. yolanda, it's cool baby, nothin's changed. we're still just talkin'.}
<P>__{(to pumpkin)}
<D>__{tell her we're still cool.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{it's cool, honey bunny, we're still cool.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(gun raised)}
<D>__{what the hell's goin' on, jules?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{nothin' i can't handle. i want you to just hang back and don't do shit unless it's absolutely necessary.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{check.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{yolanda, how we doin, baby?}
<C>__{yolanda}
<D>__{i gotta go pee! i want to go home.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{just hang in there, baby, you're doing' great, ringo's proud of you and so am i. it's almost over.}
<P>__{(to pumpkin)}
<D>__{now i want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{which one is it?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{it's the one that says bad motherfucker on it.}
<A>__{pumpkin looks in the bag and sure enough there's a wallet with "bad motherfucker" embroidered on it.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{that's my bad motherfucker. now open it up and take out the cash. how much is there?}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{about fifteen hundred dollars.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{put it in your pocket, it's yours. now with the rest of them wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful little score.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck, i'm gonna shoot 'em on general principle.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{you ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, now hang back and shut the fuck up. besides, i ain't givin' it to him. i'm buyin' somethin' for my money. wanna know what i'm buyin' ringo?}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{your life. i'm givin' you that money so i don't hafta kill your ass. you read the bible?}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{not regularly.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{there's a passage i got memorized. ezekiel 25:17. "the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. and you will know i am the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you." i been sayin' that shit for years. and if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. i never really questioned what it meant. i thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. but i saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. now i'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. and i'm the righteous man. and mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. or is could by you're the righteous man and i'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. i'd like that. but that shit ain't the truth. the truth is you're the weak. and i'm the tyranny of evil men. but i'm tryin'. i'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.}
<A>__{jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table. pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to yolanda. she looks back. grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two run out the door. jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, takes a sip of coffee.}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{it's cold.}
<A>__{he pushes it aside. vincent appears next to jules.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i think we oughta leave now.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{that's probably a good idea.}
<A>__{vincent throws some money on the table and jules grabs the briefcase. then, to the amazement of the patrons, the waitresses, the cooks, the bus boys, and the manager, these two bad ass dudes wearing uc santa cruz and "i'm with stupid" tee shirts, swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 automatics walk out of the coffee shop together without saying a word.}
