<C>__{ma}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{thank you kin'ly but she ain't well.}
<A>__{as rosasharn's eyes drop. ma bends toward her, a shy smile on her face.}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{maybe you wouldn't think it, but your pa was as nice a dancer as i ever seen, when he was young.}
<P>__{(with a little sigh)}
<D>__{kinda makes me think a ol' times.}
<A>__{the three men stroll into sight and stand watching the dancing. one glances at ma and rosasharn but does not speak. ma has smiled back at him. wilkie and jackson are seen; removed somewhat from the dance floor they are peering in the direction of the three men.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{i seen 'em before. worked at gregorio's with 'em. but i never ast 'em.}
<C>__{wilkie}
<D>__{awright. keep your eye on 'em. jus' keep 'em in sight, that's all.}

<C>__{tim}
<D>__{awright. an' if she gets outa han', i will be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.}

<D>__{mighty sure a themselves, looks like.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{all i hope, i hope they don't kill nobody.}
<A>__{in front of the joad tent, dressed to kill, is al, ready for the festivities. he wears a tight fitting wool suit, a tie on his shirt, yellow shoes, and his hair is damp and slicked down. he rubs his hands together in anticipation as he strolls in the direction of the dance floor. at another tent, a blonde girl sits on a box as al enters. casually he throws open his coat, revealing a vivid striped shirt. this is designed to stun his quarry.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{gonna dance tonight?}
<P>__{(the girl}
<D>__{ostentatiously ignores}
<P>__{him)}
<D>__{i can waltz.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(aloofly)}
<D>__{that's nothin' anybody can waltz.}
<C>__{al}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{not like me!}
<A>__{a fat woman thrusts her head out of the tent.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you git right along! this here girl's spoke for. she's gonna be married, an' her man's a comin' for her.}
<A>__{shrugging, al winks at the girl and moves on, stepping and moving his shoulders and snapping his fingers in time to the music, a very gay fellow indeed. the blonde girl's eyes follow him. then she turns and glances cautiously toward the tent. on the dance floor, we see ma and rosasharn as tom enters and stands between them. this is during a pause between dances and only a few couples stand on the floor waiting for the music to begin again. we also see the three men very casually looking around but no more casual looking than wilkie, standing just behind them, idly whistling.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{she's gettin' prettier, ma.}
<C>__{ma}
<P>__{(as rosasharn hides her face)}
<D>__{girl with a baby always gets prettier.}
<A>__{the music starts again, once more the dancers move onto the dance floor. the three men exchange a glance and step casually to the edge of the dancing space, one in the lead. they survey the scene, but for the moment make no further move. the atmosphere is tense.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{excuse me, ma.}
<P>__{(he moves quietly out}
<D>__{of the scene, toward}
<P>__{the three men)}
<A>__{al, taking the blonde girl's hand, steps onto the dance floor. encircling her waist, they begin to dance. they are a smooth, rhythmic couple who move as one being.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{well, you said anybody can waltz... how'm i doin'?}
<C>__{blonde girl}
<D>__{don't hold me so tight.}
<C>__{al}
<P>__{(tongue in cheek)}
<D>__{why, i ain't hardly touchin' you!}
<C>__{blonde girl}
<P>__{(squirming)}
<D>__{you're ticklin' me!}
<C>__{al}
<P>__{(grabbing her still closer)}
<D>__{that comes from not holdin' you tight enough.}
<C>__{blonde girl}
<P>__{(complaining but loving it)}
<D>__{now i can't breathe.}
<A>__{at this moment the leader of the three men (the other two directly behind him) enters the scene.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{i will dance with this girl.}
<C>__{al}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{you an' who else?}
<A>__{behind the three men a solid wall of migrants are closing in quietly, tom and wilkie in the middle.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{don't gimme no argament }
<P>__{(a shrill whistle sounds in the distance)}
<D>__{ you little }
<A>__{his fist goes back, his left hand reaches for al's collar. at the same instant tom grabs him, wilkie claps his hand over the leader's mouth, at least fifteen other men have similarly collard the other two invaders, and they are all lifted bodily. there is not a sound as the three men, held in iron grips, are whisked from the dance floor and into the crowd. two touring cars have stopped in front of the closed gate and the deputies have drawn guns.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{open up! we hear you got a riot.}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{riot? i don't see no riot. who're you?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{deputy sheriffs.}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{got a warrant?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{we don't need a warrant if it's a riot.}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{well, i don't know what you gonna do about it, because i don't hear no riot an' i don't see no riot, an' what's more i don't believe they is no riot.}
<P>__{(waving toward the dance floor)}
<D>__{look for yourself.}
<A>__{as the deputies, puzzled and uncertain, look toward the dance floor, we see the music, the dancing, the gaiety continuing as if nothing had happened. within the joad tent at night, several hours later: the tent is black, tom strikes a match. from a piece of wood on the ground or floor he selects one from several cigarette butts and lights it. while he is doing so, he lifts his head suddenly, and listens. in the camp street we catch sight of legs walking, the ground lighted from a flashlight. two pairs of the legs wear state policemen's leather leggings. the third pair are the caretaker's. they stop behind a car. the flashlight plays on the license plate. one of the state cops leans down to copy the license number in a booklet. then they move on. tom has lifted the edge of the tent a trifle, enough to see out by flattening his head on the floor. the legs are now seen at the joad jalopy. the light is on the license plate. the cop leans over and copies the number. they move on. tom, lowering the edge of the tent, sits up. quietly he pushes aside the piece of carpet that covers him. he is wearing his clothes. we see the policeman's car at the caretaker's hut. the two policemen get into the car.}
<C>__{caretaker}
<D>__{you got no right to arrest anybody without a warrant, you know.}
<C>__{first cop}
<D>__{we'll have a warrant just as soon as we check with headquarters.}
<A>__{the car drives off, leaving the caretaker looking somberly after it. within the joad tent, his cap on, fully dressed for travel, tom is tieing the ends of the carpet into a shoulder bundle. rising, he slings it across his shoulder. as he tiptoes toward the door:}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{ain't you gonna tell me goodbye, tommy?}
<A>__{for a moment he looks into the darkness in her direction.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i didn't know, ma. i didn't know if i ought.}
<A>__{she has risen, pulling the quilt around her. he takes her by the hand.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{come outside.}
<A>__{they go out. tom leads ma around behind the tent, to a section of wire fence. there is a bench there. tom leads ma to it and sits her down. he sits beside her.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{they was some cops here, ma. they was takin' down the license numbers. it looks like somebody knows sump'n.}
<C>__{ma}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{it had to come, i reckon, soon or later.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i'd like to stay. i'd like to be with ya }
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{ an' see your face when you an' pa get settled in a nice little place. i sure wish i could see you then. but }
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{ i guess i won't never be able to do that. not now.}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{i could hide you, tommy.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(touching her hand)}
<D>__{i know you would, ma. but i ain't gonna let you. you hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.}

<P>__{(touching his face with her fingers)}
<D>__{awright, tommy. what you figger you gonna do?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{you know what i been thinkin' about, ma? about casy. about what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. an' i remember all of it.}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{he was a good man.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i been thinkin' about us, too about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. an' i been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled }

<C>__{tom}
<D>__{no, ma. not that. that ain't it. but long as i'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe i can do sump'n. maybe i can jus' fin' out sump'n. jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.}
<P>__{(worriedly)}

<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(laughing uneasily)}
<D>__{well, maybe it's like casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul the one big soul that belongs to ever'body an' then...}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{then what, tom?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{then it don't matter. then i will be all aroun' in the dark. i will be ever'where wherever you look. wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, i will be there. wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, i will be there. i will be in the way guys yell when they're mad an' i will be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. an' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, i will be there too.}

<D>__{good by, tommy.}
<A>__{he walks away. she stands looking after him. he's leaving her forever she knows it. she lifts her hand and waves. she tries to smile. tom turns, waves, smiles. his lips form the words: "good by, ma." then he strides away into the darkness. the scene fades out. the joad truck fades in. it stands loaded in front on the joad tent while al, pa, uncle john, ma, and the little fellas pile in the last article in a fury of excitement. beyond, in the background, another jalopy is being prepared for travel with the same feverish haste. it is day.}
