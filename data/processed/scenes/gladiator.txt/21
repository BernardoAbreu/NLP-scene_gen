<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{you're lying. i could tell when you were lying even when we were children. you hate it.}

<D>__{true. but then you never had to. maximus, stop...}

<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{there was a time when you didn't call me "highness."}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{and there was a time when you were just a little girl drowning in the sea. all that was a different life.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{very different... i wonder if it was better?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{it was more honest.}
<A>__{a moment between them. we sense there is much to be said, much that could be said. finally:}
