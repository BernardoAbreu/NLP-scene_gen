<L>__{int foodway day (1954)}
<C>__{brooks }
<D>__{maybe i should get me a gun and rob the foodway, so they'd send me home. i could shoot the manager while i was at it, sort of like a bonus.}
<L>__{int brooks' room day (1954)}
<A>__{brooks is packing his worldly possessions into the carry bag. undershirts, socks, etc.}
<C>__{brooks }
<D>__{but i guess i'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.}
<L>__{int brooks' room shortly later (1954)}
<A>__{brooks is dressed in his suit. he finishes knotting his tie, puts his hat on his head. the letter lies on the desk, stampe3 and ready for mailing. his bag is by the door.}
<C>__{brooks }
<D>__{i don't like it here. i'm tired of being afraid all the time. i've decided not to stay.}
<A>__{he takes one last look around. only one thing left to do. he steps to a wooden chair in the center of the room, pulls out s pocketknife, and glances up at the ceiling beam. he steps up onto the chair. it wobbles queasily. now facing the beam, he carves a message into the wood: "brooks hatlen was here." he smiles with a sort of inner peace.}
<C>__{brooks }
<D>__{i doubt they'll kick up any fuss. not for an old crook like me.}
<B>__{tight on chair}
<A>__{his weight shifts on the wobbly chair and it goes out from under him. his feet remain where they are, kicking feebly in mid air. his hat falls to the floor. angle widens. brooks has hanged himself. he swings gently, facing the open window. traffic noise floats up from below.}
