<A>__{boom! a flash pops against the croods. swing the camera around to reveal a huge storm hanging like a purple curtain before them. the croods stop dead. the rain line bears down on them. grug tries to punch the drops.}
<B>__{on eep and guy}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you've seen rain before... right?}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{we don't get out much.}
<A>__{guy opens an umbrella to cover himself from the rain. belt pulls eep under the umbrella to be close to guy.}
<C>__{belt}
<D>__{hmmmmm.}
<A>__{belt makes an origami boat. he and sandy sail across the rain puddles. grug seeing guy and eep snuggling under the umbrella, grabs the umbrella away from guy. grug gets hit by lightning. the rest of the croods open their umbrellas to take cover as they enjoy the rain.}
<B>__{on the croods undulating reflection}
<A>__{the croods stand on a tiny island in a shallow ocean eep is pointing at her own reflection.}
<C>__{grug}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{eep, looks dangerous.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{oh dad, you say that about everything.}
<A>__{eep goes to jump in the water. guy stops her.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{careful.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{oh really? okay.}
<A>__{guy cannonballs. then surfaces. eep tentatively hops in. guy steadies her. then shows her how to move her arms in a swimming motion. guy supports eep by holding one hand under her tummy. she begins to swim. gran and ugga smile mischievously a positive vibe is building. the croods all jump at once. grug is left alone. belt uses grug's arm as a diving platform. gran, sandy and belt are doing synchronized swimming. then grug sees eep and guy surface eep is on guy's shoulders! this is too much for grug!}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{augh! no no no! not cool. not cool. not cool.}
<A>__{grug dives in to put a stop to any potential shenanigans. grug's huge tidal wave swamps guy and eep. grug sinks to the bottom. on grug laying on the bottom. his family swims above him on the tails of fishcats, confident and free and buoyant. a lone bubble escapes grug's nose, like oil oozing from a sunken wreck. he's feeling mighty extraneous. grug sees the macawnivore swimming towards him. grug swims for his life. ends in a big splash.}
