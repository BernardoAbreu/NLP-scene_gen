<L>__{interior chinese restaurant night}
<A>__{it is five minutes before midnight, new year's eve. sitting alone in the last booth is fran, a paper hat on her head, a pensive look on her face. there are two champagne glasses on the table, and the usual noisemakers, but the chair opposite her is empty. above the general hubbub, the chinese pianist can be heard playing. after a moment, fran glances off. threading his way through the merrymakers crowding the bar and overflowing from the booths is sheldrake. he is in dinner clothes, topped by a paper hat. reaching the last booth, he drops into the chair facing fran.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{sorry it took me so long on the phone. but we're all set.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{all set for what?}

<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{i know it's a drag but you can't find a hotel room in town not on new year's eve.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(a long look at sheldrake)}
<D>__{ring out the old year, ring in the new. ring a ding ding.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{i didn't plan it this way, fran actually, it's all baxter's fault.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{baxter?}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{he wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{he wouldn't.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{just walked out on me quit threw that big fat job right in my face.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(a faint smile)}
<D>__{the nerve.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{that little punk after all i did for him! he said i couldn't bring anybody to his apartment especially not miss kubelik. what's he got against you, anyway?}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(a faraway look in her eye)}
<D>__{i don't know. i guess that's the way it crumbles cookie wise.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i'd spell it out for you only i can't spell.}
<A>__{the piano player is consulting the watch on his upraised left arm. he drops the arm in a signal, and the lights go out. at the same time, he strikes up auld lang syne. all over the dimly lit room, couples get to their feet, embracing and joining in the song. in the last booth, sheldrake leans across the table, kisses fran.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{happy new year, fran.}
<A>__{fran's expression is preoccupied. sheldrake faces in the direction of the pianist, and holding his glass aloft, sings along with the others. as auld lang syne comes to an end, the place explodes noisily there is a din of horns, ratchets, and shouted greetings. the lights come up again. in the last booth, sheldrake turns back toward fran but she is no longer there. her paper hat lies abandoned on her vacated chair.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{fran }
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{ where are you, fran?}
<A>__{he rises, cranes his neck, trying to spot her in the crowd.}
