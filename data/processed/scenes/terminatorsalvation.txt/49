<L>__{interior service station dawn}
<A>__{kyle and star slither under a partially open garage door. the space is dark, smoke filled... strips of dried meat hang from the hydraulic lift. the two youths look amazed and delighted. kyle shoves the gun into his waistband, moves to the closest strip and peels off a piece, takes a tentative bite, then gnaws ravenously. star leans the shotgun against the wall and follows suit. marcus lifts the garage door and enters, dawn light streaming in behind him.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{kyle}
<P>__{(mouth full)}
<D>__{who cares?}
<A>__{marcus squints at something in the darkness. he takes a step forward, then grabs star's arm.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{spit it out!}
<C>__{star}
<P>__{(chewing)}
<D>__{it's good!}
<A>__{now kyle reacts to what marcus saw, gags and spits out meat. he's staring at a dried, severed human hand, resting on a grille in the sunken service pit, where a charcoal fire smolders. star sees it too, turns and retches, just as three animal like cannibals emerge from the back of the garage two burly, ugly, unshaven men and a wild eyed, unhealthy looking woman with matted hair. we'll call them pig, bull and cow. pig grabs the shotgun, bull grabs kyle and yanks the handgun from his waistband. cow grabs star, shoves her into the center of the garage, beside kyle and bull. bull tosses the handgun to cow who keeps it trained on the kids, sizing them up.}
<C>__{cow}
<D>__{not much meat on `em.}
<A>__{pig eyes marcus, points the shotgun in his face.}
<C>__{pig}
<D>__{this one's fi i ine }
<A>__{marcus raises two fingers like a peace sign then shoves them into the barrels of the shotgun. pig snorts and pulls the trigger click.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{oops.}
<A>__{marcus yanks the gun away and tosses it aside, head butts pig, who staggers backward, blood spraying from his nose. cow points the unloaded handgun at marcus click click. kyle and star get free of bull and dash for the exit, they're out of there in a flash. bull charges marcus, who dodges him, grabs the man and hurls him head first into the charcoal pit his body sizzles against the coals, he screams and writhes. cow picks up an axe with two hands and swings it at marcus who grabs the handle with one hand and yanks it away. cow knows she's met her match, turns and flees, heading out the way kyle and star went. marcus advances on pig and bull, brandishing the axe. pig squirms back across the floor, wiping blood from his face.}
<C>__{pig}
<D>__{we didn't kill `em! i swear to god, they was dead already, we wasn't gonna let `em rot }
<A>__{bull has scrambled out of the coal pit, but is in too much pain to rise.}
<C>__{bull}
<D>__{go `head, take as much as you want, we're on the same side here }
<A>__{marcus looks ready to finish them off but reacts to cries from outside, a loud mechanical rumble.}
