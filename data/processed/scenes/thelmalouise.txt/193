<L>__{interior car day}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{louise... are we still going to mexico?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{thelma pauses while she searches for the logic.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{then aren't we going in the wrong direction?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{well, i figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{just asking.}
<A>__{they are both quiet for a second. louise goes a little faster. thelma is digging through her bag. she hands louise a piece of beef jerky.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i don't want to see any more beef jerky. i mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. it's drivin' me crazy. the whole car smells like it.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{it's good. it's what the pioneers ate.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i don't care what the damn pioneers ate. you just keep that shit away from me, now i mean it.}
<A>__{thelma puts down her bag.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{and i don't want any more wild turkey, either. it's burning a hole in my stomach.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{okay, okay... i've got some tequila. you want some tequila?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{yeah, you want it?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{thelma starts to dig through her bag again.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{it's in here somewhere.}
<A>__{louise is rubbing her face. she looks pretty bad. her hands are shaking.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{shit. i'm gettin' tired.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<A>__{louise does not really seem alright.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i think i've really fucked up. i think i've got us in a situation where we could both get killed. why didn't we just go straight to the police.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{you know why. you already said.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{what'd i say again?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{nobody would believe us. we'd still get in trouble. we'd still have our lives ruined. and you know what else?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{that guy was hurtin' me. and if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse. and probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night. and they woulda made out like i asked for it. and my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now. at least now i'm havin' fun. and i'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. i'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me. and if i haven't, i wanna take this time to thank you, louise. thank you for savin' my ass.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i said all that?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{no, louise, you said the first part. i said all the rest.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(tired)}
<D>__{whatever.}
