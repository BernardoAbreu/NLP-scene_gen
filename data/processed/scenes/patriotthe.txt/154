<A>__{the patriots, continentals and militia, are moving out. most of the tents have been taken down. wagons are rolling out. companies of continentals march off in good order. marion's tent still stands. his men finish packing up, storing their heavy gear in wagons, tying their field gear onto their horses.}
<B>__{in the tent}
