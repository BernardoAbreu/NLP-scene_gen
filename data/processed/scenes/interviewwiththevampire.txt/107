<L>__{interior medieval room}
<A>__{medieval chairs, table, an old coffin, a bed in one corner, a blazing fire. a medieval painting of satan, being banished from heaven, above the fire. armand places the boy on the bed, settling him so he sleeps.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{disappointing, isn't it? to come so far and find so little. jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make believe...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{we had feared we were the only ones...}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{but how did you come into existence?}
<A>__{he glances at louis, then at claudia, who averts her eyes.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{you don't want to answer... two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{are you the leader of this group?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{if there were a leader, i would be the one.}
<A>__{claudia stares at him constantly, guarded.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{so you have the answers...}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{ah! you have questions?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what are we?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{nothing if not vampires...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{who made us what we are?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{surely you know the one who made you...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{but the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...}
<A>__{louis looks at the picture. armand watches him.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{that is a picture, nothing more.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you mean we are not children of satan?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he smiles at louis. a smile of infinite compassion.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{i understand. i saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. i saw you with the boy. you die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. but does that make you evil? or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{then there is nothing.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{perhaps...}
<A>__{he passes his finger through the candle flame.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{and perhaps this is the only real evil left...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{then god does not exist...}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{i have not spoken to him...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{and no vampire here has discourse with god or the devil?}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{none that i've ever known. i know nothing of god or the devil, i have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. and as far as i know, after four hundred years i am the oldest living vampire in the world.}
<A>__{he stares at them, his face angelic, hypnotic, young. his eyes hold them both in a trance.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{my god... so it's as i always feared. nothing, leading to nothing.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{you fell too much. so much you make me feel...}
<A>__{he stares from claudia to louis. he seems to be reading their souls.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{the one who made you should have told you this. the one who left the old world for the new...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{he knew nothing. he just didn't care.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{knew? you mean he is...}
<A>__{claudia appears suddenly to louis' shoulder, interrupting.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{come, beloved. it's time we were on our way. i'm hungry and the city waits.}
<A>__{she stares hard at armand. armand looks from her to louis.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{so soon to go?}
<A>__{he seems genuinely regretful. but claudia pulls louis out.}
