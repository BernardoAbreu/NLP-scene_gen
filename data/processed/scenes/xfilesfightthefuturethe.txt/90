<L>__{interior fbi office dallas morning mulder}
<A>__{enters a forensics lab with a field agent. a legend reads: fbi field office, dallas : 11:20 am.}
<C>__{field agent}
<D>__{you're looking for what amounts to a needle in a haystack. i'm afraid the explosion was so devastating there hasn't been a whole lot we've been able to put together just yet.}
<A>__{they are walking amid boxes of evidence. stacks of debris. there are forensic techs sorting through this material. it looks like the most tedious and painstaking job in the world.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{i'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. maybe something from the fema offices where the bodies were found.}
<C>__{field agent}
<D>__{we weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. they went right off to washington.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{was there anything in those offices that didn't go to d.c.?}
<C>__{field agent}
<D>__{some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. we thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out fema had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{have you examined them?}
<C>__{field agent}
<D>__{no. just fossils, far as i know.}
<A>__{mulder is nodding, when both men look off at something that's caught their attention o.s.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{i'd like this person to take a look, if you don't mind.}
<A>__{their pov agent scully standing in the doorway to the lab. she looks at mulder as if she's come in spite of her misgivings. moving toward them now.}
<C>__{field agent}
<D>__{let me just see if i can lay my hands on what you're looking for.}
<A>__{the field agent nods to scully as he passes, exiting deeper into the room. leaving mulder and scully by themselves momentarily.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you said you weren't coming?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i wasn't planning on it. particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. but i got a better look at the blood and tissue samples i took from the firemen.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{what did you find?}
<C>__{scully}
<P>__{(voice lowering pointedly)}
<D>__{something i couldn't show to anyone else. not without more information. and not without causing the kind of attention i'd just as soon avoid right now.}
<P>__{(off mulder's look)}
<D>__{the virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat i've never seen before. what it did to them it did extremely fast. and unlike the aids virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{how was it contracted?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{that i don't know. but if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.}
<A>__{mulder's reaction is postponed, or at least subdued by the reappearance of the field agent.}
<C>__{field agent}
<D>__{like i said, these are fossils, and they weren't near the blast center, so they aren't going to tell you much.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{he offers scully the small glass vials in which the bone fragments have been separated. she takes them, looking at them on her way over to the microscope. tapping out a tiny fragment onto the viewing bed. she puts her eyes down to the stereoscope eyepieces, then almost immediately looks up at mulder who translates this look almost instantly.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.}
<C>__{field agent}
<D>__{show you right on a map.}
<A>__{off mulder and scully's traded looks:}
