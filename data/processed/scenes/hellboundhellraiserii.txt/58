<L>__{interior hospital room night}
<A>__{kirsty is again lying on her back on top of the bed. she is a stark contrast to julia. no display. no laughter. her eyes are open and red rimmed from weeping now. there is also complete silence. all the more jarring, then, the sudden sound of someone fumbling at the handle of kirsty's door. her eyes widen in alarm and she flings herself off the bed, scanning the room for anything that can be used as a weapon. there is nothing but the chair and she she has all but lifted it aloft when she sees that it is kyle, who comes into the room.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{shit, kyle. this is getting to be a habit. what is it, some kind of shock therapy?}
<A>__{she was angry, relieved, and amused when she realized it was kyle and all these showed in her voice and face. now they drop away completely, replaced by a nervous apprehension as she becomes aware of the blank horror on his face.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{oh, jesus. what is it?}
<A>__{kyle opens his mouth a few times, as if unsure what to say.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{it's all true.}
