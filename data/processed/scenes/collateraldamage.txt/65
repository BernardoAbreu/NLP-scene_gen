<L>__{exterior mompos street night}
<A>__{gordy makes his way along the main drag of the frontier town. a noisy, neon lit strip of bars and brothels. everyone's packing a gun. a new dodge city, where death squad sicarios cruise past in 4x4's blaring salsa.}
<L>__{interior tropicale night}
<A>__{in here, the music's loud rock 'n' roll. gringo music for a gringo bar. the place is busy, with plenty of local "hostesses" for the men. even armstrong, standing half crocked at the bar, is flanked by two scantily clad women. he's got a spoon hanging off his nose. so does one of the girls. armstrong's trying to hang a spoon on the other. gordy slips into the bar. spots armstrong through the crowd. sees armstrong's not wearing his cap, when... the girl with the spoon on her nose turns slightly, revealing she's wearing the cap. it's on backwards, but now gordy can see the "deerborn" logo clearly. gordy wants the guerrilla travel pass inside the cap. it's a desperate move, but he's got no choice. starts toward the girl, when... gordy sees the thin federale enter the front door. the thin federale sees him at the same time. begins moving in on him. gordy moves faster toward the girl. and... the girl unwittingly does him a favor by taking off the cap and setting it on the bar, where it's easier to grab, and then turns her attention to armstrong's antics. the thin detective fights through the crowd after gordy. gordy's almost to the hat. armstrong's still having trouble with the second girl's spoon.}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{i never met a nose i couldn't hang a spoon on.}
<A>__{gordy reaches the bar, snags the cap. glances back, sees the thin federale closing in, turns to run out the back, when... a strong hand stops him. the hand belongs to the fat federale. and now the thin federale's there, too, wielding a stun gun where gordy can see it. people in the bar fall silent. everyone but armstrong, who's finally hung the spoon on the second girl's nose.}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{yahtzee!}
<A>__{and now armstong also realizes something's up. turns and sees gordy. sees the cap in gordy's hand as the fat federale addresses gordy }
<C>__{fat federale}
<D>__{come along, mr. pitt.}
<A>__{whereupon armstrong shouts drunkenly at gordy }
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{police catch you trying to steal my hat, you asshole?!}
<A>__{he staggers toward gordy. grabs the hat.}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{fucking hat thief!}
<A>__{armstrong takes a drunken swing at gordy, but... instead of hitting gordy, armstrong accidentally on purpose clocks the fat detective. then hisses into gordy's ear, clearly not that drunk }
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{get outta here }
<A>__{but then armstrong's legs won't work as the thin federale jams the stun gun against his neck, and 10,000 volts surprise the armstrong neural network. gordy moves against the thin federale in anger, when... the fat federale zaps him with another stun gun, just behind the ear... and gordy gets to know the floor, too.}
