<L>__{interior testing service focus group room day}
<A>__{through a one way mirror, gavin and susan watch as the moderator asks a group of twelve male viewers about the pilot they just watched. their comments are mostly positive. gavin and susan share relieved looks. she has a notepad, as always. one agitated man keeps staring at the mirror, right at gavin. (we recognize him as the parole officer from part one.)}
<C>__{gavin}
<D>__{that guy's looking at me.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{he can't see you.}
<A>__{as a test, gavin waves his arm. the agitated man's expression changes slightly, but it's not clear whether it's in reaction or not. the moderator directs her next question to the agitated man.}
<C>__{moderator}
<D>__{how about you? did you feel it was...}
<C>__{agitated man}
<D>__{it's not real.}
<C>__{moderator}
<D>__{and what do you mean by that?}
<C>__{agitated man}
<D>__{the show's not real. why can't you see that? jesus! are you fucking blind?}
<P>__{(looking at the mirror)}
<D>__{you think you're above it all, don't you? you are trapped here with the rest of them, brother.}
<A>__{he stands up, pushing past the other people to come right up to the one way glass. he stares directly at gavin, even though he shouldn't be able to see him. he shouts:}
<C>__{agitated man }
<D>__{get out. get out! oblivio accebit!}
<A>__{gavin backs away from the glass, freaked out.}
