<L>__{exterior park day}
<A>__{we float down through a serene, leafy park to the children's play area. there, in the sandbox, a beautiful five year old girl plays among a group of kids.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{i have a theory about how this all started...}
<A>__{a six year old boy approaches. he watches the little girl for a moment as she gently shapes her sand castle. and then out of nowhere the little boy pushes the}
<B>__{little girl down.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{why did you do that?}
<C>__{little boy}
<D>__{because you smell like dog poo.}
<A>__{some of the other kids snicker at this brilliant one liner. our little girl's face turns red.}
<C>__{little boy }
<D>__{you're so stupid just like dog poo! you're made of poo!}
<A>__{and then, just to punctuate, he jumps on the sandcastle, smashing it. finally, our little girl starts to cry.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{our beautiful girl sits at a kitchen table with her mom. she can only get out one syllable between big, wet sobs.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{made. (sob) of. (sob) dog. (sob) poo.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{honey, do you know why that little boy did those things? and said those things?}
<A>__{the little girl shakes her head no.}
<C>__{mom }
<D>__{because he likes you.}
<A>__{freeze frame on our little girl's face trying to}
<B>__{process this.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{uh excuse me but what the hell? where did that rumor start? because moms have been spreading it for years.}
<A>__{back to the scene the mom continues...}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{that little boy is doing those terrible things because he has a crush on you.}
<A>__{we see our little girl take this in, like she is just now beginning to understand the ways of the world.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{do you understand what this means? we are all encouraged to believe that if a guy acts like a total jerk that means he likes you. sure, that's a lesson that might serve us as five year olds, but many of us keep believing this advice well into adulthood.}
<L>__{interior dorm room night}
<A>__{a cute college girl sits crying in front of her answering machine, as her roommate looks on.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{then, as we get older, we carry on this tradition of misreading the signals men send by encouraging our friends to do the same...}
<A>__{the machine evilly flashes 0 in the new messages window.}
<D>__{roommate #1 that phi delt so obviously liked you. i'm sure he just lost your number.}
<L>__{interior high rise office day}
<A>__{a hot executive woman stands in the office hallway, watching a sexy male colleague walk by. he does not give her a second glance. her female secretary looks on.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{he's not asking you out because he's intimidated by your professional success and emotional maturity.}
<L>__{interior bar night}
<A>__{a bunch of twenty somethings sipping cocktails. one of them is crying smeared mascara, puffy eyes, etc.}
<D>__{cute twentysomething #1 here's the problem. he likes you too much. you're too pretty and awesome. he can't handle it.}
<L>__{interior burger king day}
<B>__{two female cashiers work side by side.}
<D>__{cashier #1 trust me. it's because he's just getting out of a serious relationship.}
<L>__{interior gym day}
<A>__{two middle aged women work out on ellipticals.}
<D>__{middle aged woman #1 trust me. it's because he's never had a serious relationship.}

<A>__{a pretty young woman weaves banana leaves with a friend.}
<C>__{friend }
<D>__{i'm sure he forgot your hut number. or didn't get enough approval from his father. or was eaten by a giraffe.}
<A>__{this last part seems to cheer up the pretty woman.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{why do we say this stuff to each other? why do we tell each other these lies? gigi (v.o.) (cont'd) is it possible that it's because we're too scared, and it's too hard, to say the one obvious truth that's staring everyone in the face?}
<A>__{the screen goes black. and then the title fades up: he's just not that into you...}
<L>__{interior brewer's art night}
<A>__{gigi, pretty and approachable, sits in a booth at a hip mt. vernon date spot with conor, cute but holding onto his frat boy roots. they sip their near empty cocktails.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{so, janine told me you're a real estate agent.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{yeah. but don't worry not one of the cheesy ones who puts his headshot on bus benches and grocery carts.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{so just like on frisbees and notepads?}
<A>__{conor laughs. gigi smiles she's doing well.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{you got it.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{much classier.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{my thoughts exactly.}
<A>__{gigi sips her drink, and looks at conor.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{i wonder why janine never thought of introducing us before?}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{yeah, i don't know, i ummm }
<A>__{their waitress appears, cutting him off.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{you guys ready for another round?}
<A>__{conor looks to gigi.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{you want one more?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{only if you do. but i mean, if you have to get going i totally ...}
<A>__{gigi trails off. conor considers this for a long moment. we can see on gigi's face that she knows that the outcome of this date hangs in the balance. it's an eternity.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{umm. ok. sure. one more.}
<A>__{gigi breathes a sigh of relief.}
<C>__{conor }
<D>__{you had ketel and soda, right?}
<A>__{gigi nods and smiles, clearly flattered that conor remembered her order. she scoots a little closer to him.}
<L>__{exterior brewer's art night}
<A>__{gigi and conor hug outside the restaurant.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{well, conor, i had a really nice time.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{yeah. it was really nice meeting you.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{b bye.}
<A>__{gigi waves flirtatiously and walks away, smiling. she turns around to look, and sees conor take his cell}
<B>__{phone out of his pocket.}
<A>__{gigi takes her cell out of her purse and dials.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{hey, it's me. he's cute. i think it went well.}
<A>__{she sneaks another look over her shoulder to see conor.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{and i think he might me leaving me a message at home as we speak.}
<A>__{we freeze frame on gigi, mid step. then, the image}
<T>__{slides over to find:}
<A>__{conor also in freeze frame. the image unfreezes and we continue with conor as he dials his cell phone.}

<D>__{conor, that's so nice. thank you.}
<A>__{as anna gets to the checkout, there's one person ahead of her. he looks back to see her he's ben, good looking and supremely likeable. they share a smile.}
<C>__{ben}

<D>__{you've only got one thing.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well, technically it's six. and i'm still mulling over a gum purchase. so...}
<A>__{he steps aside to let her go. she smiles.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hey, let me call you right back.}
<A>__{she hangs up the phone and moves past ben, hands her things to the emotionless cashier. as he rings them up she looks back at ben they share another look. she hands the cashier her atm card he swipes it.}
<C>__{emotionless cashier}
<D>__{oh my word.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{come on. seriously. i just deposited money today. there's no way }
<C>__{emotionless cashier}
<D>__{it's not that. let me check something.}

<D>__{our "sizzlin' summer" promotion. you're our 1000th customer in june.}
<A>__{the cashier reaches under the register and pulls out an igloo cooler and hands it to anna. she beams.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{are you kidding?}
<C>__{emotionless cashier}
<D>__{do i have that kind of manner? a joking manner?}
<A>__{anna looks to ben. she looks like she's about to burst.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i swear to god, this is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me.}
<A>__{ben can't tell if she's kidding.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{is that sad?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no, it's charming. congratulations.}
<A>__{anna smiles wide, admiring her cooler. then }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{wait, no. i can't accept this. you were here first. i didn't win at all.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yes, you did. trust me it's fate. you were meant to have that cooler.}

<C>__{conor }
<D>__{i know. i will call back and say that i'm going to bed.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{at 9:30 pm? genius.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{it is genius. because then i can say: "in case you were going to call me back don't 'cause i will be sleeping."}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{sounds foolproof.}
<A>__{conor pulls off his jacket and tosses it next to a box which contains about 50 frisbees. on each frisbee: a large picture of conor, with his phone number and the title: conor barry real estate agent conor dials his cell phone as he heads back to his room.}

<D>__{i think you were telling me how you don't want to be like your mom and wake up and realize you didn't pursue your dreams.}

<C>__{anna}
<D>__{was i? little intense for grocery store chatter. sorry.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's ok. i might even be able to help you out. there's a guy at my firm who has exclusively music clients.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that would be amazing. what are you like my savior?}
<A>__{anna digs through her purse to find a piece of paper. she writes down her number, and holds it out to him. he looks at it, contemplating. he doesn't take it.}

<C>__{neil}
<D>__{no, babe.}
<A>__{he sits back down, puts his arms around her.}
<C>__{neil }
<D>__{going against nature is like that cat who started nursing that monkey. we're just two people who aren't married.}

<C>__{beth}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{i actually think the odds of having a successful relationship increase by not getting married. look at my parents all marriage got them was thirty two years of misery and joint checking.}

<D>__{ok, so clearly he hasn't called.}

<D>__{you set me up with him.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{no you asked if i knew any guys and i gave conor your number. that's not a set up. when i do a set up i weigh pros and cons. i do my due diligence. all i know about conor is he sold us this house.}

<C>__{amber}
<D>__{caller id was the worst thing that's ever happened to me. total invasion of my personal freedom. when a guy doesn't call me, it is my right my duty even to call him and hang up several thousand times. or at least until his mother shouts at me in albanian and blows a police whistle into the phone. i mean, calling and hanging up is an age old expression of love and frustration and too many wine coolers and who is at& f'ing t to take that away from me?}

<D>__{yeah. "nice meeting you" at the beginning of the date is normal. "nice meeting you" at the end could be a blow off.}

<D>__{maybe it was at the beginning.}

<D>__{then that's fine. he's gonna call.}

<L>__{interior the owl bar night}
<A>__{a speakeasy from the 1900s that hasn't changed much. a piano starts to play on a tiny stage empty. and then a terrified but determined anna takes her place in front of the mic. and begins to sing. it's a "the last goodbye" by jeff buckley barely recognizable more of a torch song. as she sings, she begins to gain confidence. we hear the song over:}

<D>__{how did all this stuff fit in here fine before?}
<A>__{beth comes in after him, holding some of his clothes.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i don't know. it expanded.}

<C>__{neil}
<D>__{okay, okay. you win. just check to make sure there's nothing in the pockets before we give them away.}
<A>__{beth dutifully puts her hands in the pockets. and then she feels something. her face registers curiosity as she pulls out a black velvet ring box. beth looks at it, and when she looks up neil's down on one knee.}
<C>__{neil }
<D>__{i love you so much. so much. i want to make you happy. i need to make you happy for me to even have a shot at being happy, too.}

<C>__{alex}
<D>__{true.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{hmmm. because when i was hurling my body onto yours you did not seem to want to "make it happen."}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{here's the thing about that. you were right. i've gotten so used to keeping myself at a safe distance from these women, having the power that i didn't know what it felt like when i actually fell for one of them.}
<A>__{gigi considers this.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{look, i've just been out with your friend bill. and it just might be exactly what i need. no drama. he calls. he does what he says.}
