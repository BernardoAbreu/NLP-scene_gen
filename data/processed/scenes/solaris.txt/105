<A>__{on the prometheus. rheya is awake, kelvin asleep. she rises and goes to sit in a chair; she is anxious, something we haven't seen before. kelvin wakes up, looks at her. noting her expression:}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{what's wrong.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{you don't love me.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{stop.}
<A>__{a beat. she looks down.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{i have to talk to you... i... i don't know where i came from.}
<P>__{(up at him)}
<D>__{do you know?}
<A>__{he doesn't respond.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{if you know but can't tell me now... will you ever be able to?}
<A>__{calmly:}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{that i am not rheya. that rheya died. killed herself. i'm different.}
<A>__{he's looking at her, and knows this is dangerous territory.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{who have you been talking to?}
<C>__{rheya}
<P>__{(no reason to lie)}
<D>__{sartorius.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{when? when i'm asleep?}
<A>__{she nods. he can only imagine what form sartorius' anecdotes must have taken.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{i'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but i don't know who they are.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{i'm just trying to understand what's going on.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{how have you lived the last ten years? did you love anyone?}
<A>__{a long beat. kelvin shakes his head.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{did you think about me?}
<A>__{another beat. he nods. then:}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{but we fought.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{yes. especially toward the end.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{why did she do it?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{you... she said i didn't love her.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{was she right?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{no. i love you.}
<C>__{rheya}
<P>__{(reflexive, but genuine)}
<D>__{i love you, too.}
<A>__{if she seems satisfied for the moment, kelvin knows the feeling won't last.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{can you sleep?}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{i don't think do. it's not sleep; it's something else. it's all around me.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{those are dreams.}
<A>__{she falls asleep.}
