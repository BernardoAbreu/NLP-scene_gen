<L>__{interior cat's apartment day}
<A>__{cat enters a completely bare bones dwelling, there is nothing that identifies the person who lives here. white bare walls, a table with one chair, a single bed. along one wall, a cabinet. on the window sill a single cataleya orchid. cat waters the orchid. cat opens the cabinet to three computer screens. two of them are divided into quarters and show various views of the building entrance, the lobby, the stairway, the elevator, the hallway. the third screen is dark, until cat hits a button and music fills the apartment. music with a heavy sensual back beat. french rap. ooh la la. and the screen pulses and glows in time to the beat. cat's body responds to the music, moving sexy, her shoulders rolling, her hips swaying.}

<A>__{cat sashays across the open space, a stripper strutting her stuff; shedding, first her blouse, then her jeans, her lingerie, until, by the time she reaches a free standing opaque cylinder of a shower with an opaque shower curtain, she is completely nude. she enters the shower. turns on the water. like a snake shedding a skin, she lets the water divest her of everything that came before.}
