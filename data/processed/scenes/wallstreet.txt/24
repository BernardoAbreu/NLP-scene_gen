<L>__{exterior columbus avenue night}
<A>__{the upper west side. the young, the rich and the restless parade along the avenue, jamming the neighborhood restaurants and bars. bud glides along, feeling a part of the crowd now, past a dreadlocked derelict swigging thunderbird and shouting obscenities, shaking a wooden african spear.}
<L>__{interior restaurant bar night}
<A>__{inside a glitzy neighborhood singles bar in which bud stops, everybody seems to be young and drinking margueritas. bud orders a beer, surveying the room like a veteran, overhearing the conversation of a young trader to two other broker types.}
<C>__{young trader}
<D>__{...you know marty wyndham? he netted $650,000 out of that merger...26 years old, the guy's rambo. got himself a porsche turbo cabriolet about 75 thou, got a house in westhampton, penthouse on second avenue, gets up at 2:30 in the morning, he's in the office at 4...guy never sleeps...rambo genes...}
<A>__{he blathers on as bud surveys the room, noticing an elegant blonde with a striking aloof beauty, very much the debutante dream grace kelly type, so refined that you wonder what she could possibly be doing out at night in public alone. bud summons his courage, catches his breath, makes his way over... she sees him approach, obviously doesn't wish to talk, eyes darting elsewhere like a nervous deer.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(awkward)}
<D>__{hi...can i buy you a drink? i'm celebrating tonight.}
<C>__{blonde}
<P>__{(disdainful)}
<D>__{please, no thanks...}
<P>__{(looking away)}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{look, i know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but i'm different, i never talk to strangers, all my life i've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but i do and if you walk away now i will never see you again or you me. you'll grow old.}
<C>__{blonde}
<D>__{oh really.}
<C>__{bud }
<D>__{i will grow old. we'll both die. and we'll never have known each other. that's sad. at least one drink for a dreamer...what's your favorite drink?}
<A>__{she looks at him, not quite sure. is he serious or glib?}
<C>__{blonde}
<P>__{(uncommitted)}
<D>__{grand marnier.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{sounds like a french word, what is it?}
<C>__{blonde}
<D>__{it's a romantic and tragic drink.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{sounds tempting. i prefer mine with a twist of fate. you know like us meeting. don't go away...}
<A>__{maybe, just maybe she's his! his eyes show it as he hurries back to the bar to order. as he gets the bartender's attention, he turns and sees that she is joined by a man who looks as if he stepped out of the pages of gq. together they walk away. stung, bud watches as the woman of his dreams disappears out the door.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{...i just lost it.}
