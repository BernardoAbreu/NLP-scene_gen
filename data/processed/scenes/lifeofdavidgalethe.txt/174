<L>__{interior wright cabin}
<A>__{bitsey has what looks like an office christmas party. she goes for another tape the last. cheyenne autumn comes up on the screen. she hits eject. she gets up, unsure what to do nexterior she goes back to the bookshelf, pulls books out to look behind them for more tapes, indifferent to the mess. she goes to a filing cabinet, quickly rifles it. she looks around the room, sees something. she goes to a large oak desk with an old typewriter on it. after the other drawers, she looks in the lap drawer. it's empty except for large padded envelope addressed to "bitsey bloom news magazine 40 w. 43rd st. new york, new york 10036." a beat as she stares in disbelief. she rips it open, pulls out a vhs cassette and checks the label: "constance." the phone rings, startling her. she looks at the phone, then at the clock: 5:14. the phone doesn't ring again. a beat of absolute silence. bitsey goes quickly to the vcr and puts in the tape hands shaking. after a few seconds, constance appears standing in her kitchen by the sink, dressed in a bathrobe. she's wearing the kitchen gloves and fills a glass with water.}
<B>__{on video}
<A>__{constance turns from the sink:}
<C>__{constance }
<P>__{(her voice weak)}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{the response is silent, but she nods. a beat she bites her lower lip. in one quick movement she takes the key from the handcuffs and swallows it with the water. it goes down with difficulty; she coughs, then signals she's okay. she puts the glass in the sink. she takes the duct tape roll, rips off a long section, sticks one end to the back of her gloved hand. she tears off another small section, drops the roll on the floor. she tapes the small section over her mouth. she then takes the plastic bag from the counter, looks at it a beat. constance turns toward camera, mouth taped, eyes watering. she nods once, and turns back. she quickly puts the bag over her head. after she has smoothed the excess air out with one hand, she takes the packing tape from the other. she seals the bag around her neck. she smoothly takes off the gloves. they're inside out and she snaps them so that the fingers extend. she drops them upside down on the dish rack. she removes her robe she's nude beneath and tosses it aside. it lands in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. she feels for the handcuffs on the counter, takes them. she sits on the floor, cuffs herself. she rolls onto her side, perfectly still, waiting.}
<B>__{on bitsey}
<A>__{engrossed, trembling. the spell breaks as she comes to the part of the tape she's seen before. averting her eyes, she fast forwards past where constance struggles to where she dies. constance lies perfectly still. a beat.}

<A>__{a man wearing gloves walks into the frame: dusty.}
<B>__{on bitsey}
<A>__{this is what she's needed.}
<B>__{video}
<A>__{dusty goes to constance, kneels and, removing a glove, checks her pulse. he looks briefly up into the camera, then stands. he picks up her robe and comes back past the tripod. a beat. we see only constance's dead body then black.}
<B>__{on bitsey}
<A>__{a hand grabs her shoulder. she screams and spins around. it's zack, breathing hard.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{he didn't show! fuckin' move!}
<A>__{bitsey hits the eject button.}
