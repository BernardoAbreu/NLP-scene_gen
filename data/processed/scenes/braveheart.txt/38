<L>__{exterior macclannough house night}
<A>__{outside the half timbered house, william stands in the shadows of moonlight and tosses a pebble against the wooden upper window. marion opens the shutters and slips out onto the vines, dropping into william's arms. giggling, suppressing laughter, they run to the trees... scottish highlands night hand in hand through the heather they run, silhouettes along a ridge, their breath blowing silver clouds in the moonlight, the scottish wind whipping through their hair. they stop at a grove at the edge of a precipice, overlooking a loch gleaming in the moonlight. so beautiful it's sacred.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you've been here before?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{some nights. i have dreams. mostly dreams i don't want. i started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when i did sleep i'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{did it work?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{no. you don't choose your dreams. your dreams choose you.}
<A>__{he looks at her. they kiss suddenly, so long and hard that they tumble into the heather, rolling, devouring each other. through their passion...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i want... to marry you!}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i... accept your proposal!}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i'm not just saying it!}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{nor i!}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{but i won't give you up to any nobleman.}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(stopping)}
<D>__{you scare me.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i don't want to scare you. i want to be yours, and you mine. every night like this one.}
