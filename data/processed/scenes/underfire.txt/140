<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior streets of managua night}
<A>__{alex, price, and claire get out of a cab and approach a large statue of somoza on horseback, surreally lit by floodlights in the center of a traffic circle. four guardia soldiers are visible on the sidewalk in the b.g. drinking with two women.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{this is what i want to show you.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{we drove through three roadblocks a half hour before curfew so you could show me a statue of tacho.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{it's not tacho. it's mussolini. tacho went to italy to commission a statue of himself, he found a warehouse full of il duces on horseback, got a great deal on one of 'em brought it back and switched heads.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ya can't tell, can ya?}
<A>__{silence. alex knows price too well it's a great story but that's not why they're here.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what the hell are you talking about?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i think what he's trying to say what we're trying to say is that things aren't exactly what they seem to be.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{well, they don't "seem" to be that great so i can't wait for this one...}
<P>__{(mocks silliness)}
<D>__{hey, here we are! two guys in the tropics in love with the same dame... bullets flying!}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{alex! that's not why we're here.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{oh yeah? i left the country because of him...}
<P>__{(points to price)}
<D>__{...and i came back because of him...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and now the cutest couple in town has me looking up a horse's ass on a midnight tour of managua.}
<P>__{(points up the statue's ass)}
<D>__{what are we doing here?}
<A>__{silence. claire addresses alex calmly.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{rafael is dead.}
<A>__{silence. alex isn't quite sure he understood.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{in the picture he's dead?}
<C>__{price}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{dead!}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{how the hell...}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(interrupts quickly)}
<D>__{who cares how?!}
<A>__{silence. a bit of gallows laughter from alex as he circles the statue. price calms and tries to explain.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{alex... i think i finally saw one too many bodies.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{somoza is a killer.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i thought the war would end sooner.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how many reasons do you want?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you saw too many bodies? that's a lot of bodies.}
<P>__{(beat; to price)}
<D>__{you stupid son of a bitch.}
<P>__{(to claire)}
<D>__{did he talk you into it?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{no! i wanted rafael to be alive.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{in some way i understand him doing it, i don't like it but i understand... but you?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i'd do it again.}
<A>__{alex lets it all sink in. these two people about whom he has such passionate feelings have totally exposed themselves to him.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you two have, of course, just served me up your balls if that's what they're called on a platter.}
<P>__{(several beats)}
<D>__{i can bury you both. you're handing me your careers.}
<A>__{they don't respond he's right.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{well, jesus christ... this is a motherfucking story, russell...}
<P>__{(long silence)}
<D>__{what am i supposed to do with it?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{anything you want.}
<A>__{small, tired gallows laughter from alex. there is a long silence before alex speaks, aware of the irony.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{they're holding the lead in the world section for rafael.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{it's great stuff, isn't it? we'd go down in a blaze of glory.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{oh yeah...}
<P>__{(distraught)}
<D>__{i don't know what to do.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i've gotta take some kind of a story back with me. maybe jazy, eh?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{oh jesus.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{it's a little dangerous looking for jazy at the moment.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(mock heroic)}
<D>__{ah, danger i love it. you could ask the pointy shoed little bastard about your pictures... and i could ask him whatever happened to isela.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{she's an officer in the rafael army we saw her in matagalpa.}
<A>__{alex is surprised slightly, but takes pleasure in revealing it.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you mean i slept with a sandinista?}
<A>__{price and claire exchange glances. alex is dead serious.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i guess rafael is alive, eh?}
