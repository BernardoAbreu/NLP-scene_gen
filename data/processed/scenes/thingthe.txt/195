<A>__{perspiring profusely, his hand trembling slightly, prepares to continue the test. he heats the wire. the men are pouring sweat, white knuckled. one of the smaller torches is pointed at nauls. he closes his eyes. macready places the heated wire into his plate. hiss. macready exhales. nauls opens his eyes. macready unties nauls with one hand, while the torch stays glued to the others. macready heats the wire once again. both he and nauls have torches aimed at sanchez. sanchez is near tears. the wire is dipped into the plate... hisssss. sanchez breaks down and sobs.}

<A>__{sits stoicly, while he watches the preparations for his turn.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{let's do it, bwana.}
<A>__{nauls and sanchez take aim five yards away. fierce, determined. the wire comes off the flame into the plate... the harmless hissing. the muscles in childs' face melt into a sigh.}

<B>__{all eyes}
<A>__{snap towards station manager garry. childs, suddenly realizing who he is sitting next to, squirms.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{get me... get me the hell away from... cut me loose, damn it!}
<A>__{nauls rips away his bindings. the other two stand guard. childs scrambles off the couch and onto the floor.}
<B>__{garry}
<A>__{stares grimly ahead. childs soaks his clothing with a can of gasoline. he is then surrounded. the room tenses, adrenalin pumps, breathing halts. the burner. the torches. the wire. the plate. garry's face. hisssss. macready tries again. hiss. the men breathe. their torches are lowered. nauls throws his on the floor. sanchez and childs flop down in chairs. macready wipes his face. a long silence. sanchez weeps quietly with relief.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{i know you gentlemen have been through a lot. but when you find the time... i'd rather not spend the rest of the winter tied to this couch.}
<A>__{a beat. childs starts to giggle. the strain on macready's jaw begins to lessen. garry sits catatonic. nauls scowls at childs' uncontrollable laughter. the infectious rasping causes macready a slight smile as he looks up, taking comfort in the sound of the raging antarctic wind vibrating the roof. nauls, untying garry, grumbles, at childs.}
<C>__{nauls}
<D>__{shut the damn hell up.}
<A>__{childs wipes his eyes and grins over toward macready. his smile fades, macready is now stone faced. childs' grin goes stale, in sudden realization.}
