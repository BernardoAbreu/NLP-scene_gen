<A>__{lightning streaks across the night sky outside. we catch a glimpse of the moon disappearing behind the clouds. genvieve reaches the bottom of the stairs. the tomb itself. water trickles in through cracks in the lichen covered walls, pooling on the tomb floor. genvieve moves forward, her lantern throwing distorted shadows over everything... in front of her is anton lemarche's stone sarcophagus. genvieve kneels in the water, one hand resting on the spiked iron railing which surrounds the tomb. she reaches the other hand towards a scum covered plaque, brushing the grime away... thunder and lightning reach a crescendo as... a skeletal hand rises out of the water, reaching for her. genvieve screams. the lantern falls from her grasp, sputtering out. the hand reaches for her arm and inadvertently clutches her breast instead... genvieve starts to laugh hysterically.}

<D>__{what's the hurry, junior? where you off to?}
<A>__{clyde quickens his pace, pulling ahead of geoff and stopping in front of him. stevie and brad move in on either side. surrounded by peers, it's apparent how small geoff is for his age. on the wall next to them is a bulletin board display. clyde glances at it. geoff follows his gaze.}

<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{fuckin' ass hole.}

<A>__{the woods here have grown long with shadows. the air is still and the sound of birds is conspicuously absent. a wooden archway frames the entrance to the primitive graveyard. scrawled across the weatherstained boards is a child's barely legible attempt at "pet sematary." geoff trepidatiously enters the clearing of crude, crowded graves. collars, leashes, bird cages and other accessories adorn the makeshift crosses and headstones. geoff moves along the outer circle of markers, each crafted by a child's caring hands. as he searches, he can't help but notice the heartfelt epitaphs. on the outer circle, he sees a crate board marker memorializing:}
<B>__{smucky the cat... he was obediant.}
<A>__{moving inward, the markers are older. the ones he can still read convey a sense of the perpetual cycle of life and death. here is a wide, flat, upright board planted deep in the earth: "in memory of marta our pet rabit dyed march 1 1965." the next three rows are illegible, the inscriptions are weathered beyond recognition... and then, chiseled into sandstone: hannah the best dog that ever lived 1929 1939. and now... "meow." fainterior but very much alive. geoff picks up his pace, weaving quickly toward the center. there, he finds tiger. trapped in a rusted old birdcage, its base swallowed by the grave. geoff opens the door and frees tiger, stroking the trembling kitten. geoff's eyes are drawn to the far perimeter... to the deadfall... the deadfall looms on the outskirts of the clearing like a pile of skeletal remains. an abstract stairway to things beyond. a wind picks up just then, sending leaves skittering in waves across the ground.}

<C>__{chase}
<D>__{holy shit!}
<A>__{chase levels his gun with a trembling hand. gus stabs the air with the drill, feeding on chase's horror. chase pulls the trigger. a bullet pounds gus' chest. a spray of flesh explodes from his back. unphased, gus regains his balance.}

<D>__{god i hate when that happens...}

<D>__{no brain, no pain, chase. think about it...}
<A>__{the whirling drill bit is millimeters away from chase's eye. he clutches gus' arm, trying to force the drill aside... at the last second, adrenaline kicks in and chase diverts the drill. it sinks into the counter top nearby... stuck. gus roars, lashing out, but chase manages to duck away... chase catches sight of his gun on the floor. he scrambles for it, scooping it up... bullets are rolling across the floor every which way. chase slaps his palm down on one and desperately fumbles with the chamber... gus' hands clamp down around chase's neck. he swings chase around and slams him against the wall, lifting him off his feet... chase gasps as the life is literally crushed out of him... he brings the gun up beneath gus' chin and jams it into his ruined throat. gus just keeps on throttling him...}
