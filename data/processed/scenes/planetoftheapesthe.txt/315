<A>__{cornelius thumbs through the book, finds the citation and reads aloud:}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{'beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn. alone among god's primates, he kills for sport, or lust or greed. yes, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. shun him. drive him back into his jungle lair: for he is the harbinger of death'.}

<D>__{do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, taylor? that of an animal. if you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.}

<P>__{(shrugs; then, sardonically)}
<D>__{of course, you could return with us. our society might find a place for you and your mate.}

<C>__{zaius}
<P>__{(calmly, without rancor)}
<D>__{because you are a man. and you were right i have always known about man. from the evidence, i believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. his emotions must rule his brain. he must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him even himself.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{what evidence? no weapons were found in the cave.}
<C>__{zaius}
