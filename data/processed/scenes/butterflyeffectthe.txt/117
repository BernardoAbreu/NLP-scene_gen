<L>__{exterior college quad day 2002}
<A>__{kayleigh, wearing a long skirt and tight red sweater, catches the eye of every guy on campus. she and evan stroll arm in arm through the quad. somehow, the world seems brighter now. even the colors seem more vibrant when compared to the somewhat grimmer world we've known. many students wave to evan and call his name. he can't remember all their names but it's kinda cool being the bmoc. evan takes a long look at her and becomes curious.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{well i remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. why would that freak me out?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i dunno.}
<P>__{(goofy smile)}
<D>__{just being weird.}
<A>__{kayleigh playfully sweeps her leg around to kick him on the ass, then smiles as if a ghost must have done it.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{such a goofus. see you tonight.}
<A>__{kayleigh gives him a big unexpected kiss and walks away. after a moment of wow, evan runs off to class himself.}
