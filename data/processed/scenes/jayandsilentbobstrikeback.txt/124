<L>__{interior soundstage bluntcave set}
<A>__{it looks like the batcave, but it's not. off to the side, near the monitor and chair setup, a black director eyeballs the hustling, white crew.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{look at all these crackers, seventy million dollars and i can't even get a black grip?}
<A>__{a white p.a. brings a cup of latte to the director.}
<C>__{p.a.}
<D>__{here's your coffee, sir.}
<C>__{director}
<P>__{(eyes the coffee)}
<D>__{you spit in this? because i know all you white folks are pissed off that the studio'd entrust a multi million dollar to a brother.}
<C>__{p.a.}
<D>__{i didn't spit in it, sir.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{then taste it! go on!}
<A>__{the p.a. takes the cup and sips from it. he tries to hand it back to the director.}
<C>__{p.a.}
<D>__{it's all good, sir.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{no it ain't all good. oh, you think i want it now, after your lips touched the cup? get the fuck off my set!}
<C>__{p.a.}
<D>__{you the man, sir.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{no you the man! and that's the problem!}
<A>__{the director glares at the scared p.a., as he cautiously skulks off. banky edwards approaches.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{uh, chaka? yeah, hi i'm banky edwards, the creator of bluntman and chronic. we met a few weeks back. i'm the executive producer. director chaka oh you're the executive producer, hunh? well go "produce" me a latte no white folks spit in okay fucky?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{banky. i just wanted you to know that i respect your work as an artist. i'm something of an artist myself. i was the inker on the comic book.}
<C>__{chaka}
<D>__{an inker? what, like you trace?}
<A>__{banky's face drops as the a.d. joins them.}
<C>__{a.d.}
<D>__{biggs and van der beek are on the set, chaka.}
<C>__{chaka}
<D>__{i don't see 'em. where are they?}
<P>__{(into bullhorn)}
<D>__{where the fuck are the stars of this piece of shit?!}
<A>__{on the bluntcave set, two massive doors open in the fake rock. smoke pours in, and jay and silent bob now dressed as bluntman and chronic step from the darkness. jay and bob survey the set, amazed.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{this must've set 'em back a couple hundred bucks.}
<C>__{chaka}
<D>__{look at this shit.}
<P>__{(off their outfits)}
<D>__{a gay hood ornament, and the color purple.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{who the fuck are you?}
<C>__{chaka}
<D>__{who the fuck am i? i'm the fucking director, is who i am. chaka luther king. the creator of all of this.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{wait a sec i thought holden and banky created this shit.}
<C>__{chaka}
<D>__{and i'm stealing it. i'm taking it back for all the shit you people have stolen from us! did you know, i came up with the idea for sesame street before pbs? i was going to call it n.w.p. niggaz with puppets.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{alright enough small talk. let's shoot it.}
<A>__{chaka heads back toward his monitor. jay and bob are confused.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{wait, wait, wait!! aren't you gonna direct us?}
<C>__{chaka}
<D>__{i will be directing you to the food stamps line after i fire your ass, if you talk back like that to me again!}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{but we don't know what we're supposed to do here. we didn't even read the script.}
<C>__{chaka}
<D>__{so? neither did i. shit, neither did the studio.}
<P>__{(pointing o.c.)}
<D>__{look man, it's not hard. in this scene, the bad guy breaks into the bluntcave. you make up some shit, fight him for a while, i film it, i yell "cut," and then head back to my trailer, where i got more white women waiting for me there than the first lifeboat off the titanic!}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{they all want a part of the movie, and i got just the part for 'em.}
<A>__{jay and silent bob go wide eyed, as chaka heads off.}
<C>__{chaka}
<D>__{let's roll with the new!}
<C>__{a.d. }
<D>__{quiet on the set! this is a take!}
<A>__{chaka climbs behind his monitor. the p.a. is waiting for him with another cup of coffee.}
<C>__{p.a.}
<D>__{i got you another cup of coffee, sir. spit free.}
<A>__{chaka smacks the coffee out of his hand and sits down. the clapper loader jumps in front of the startled jay and bob, getting ready. after a beat, he turns to silent bob.}
<D>__{clapper loader i just wanna say that i loved when you fucked that pie.}
<P>__{(calling off)}
<D>__{bluntman and chronic strike back, scene thirty seven, take one!}
<A>__{the clapper loader shuts the clapboard and races off. from behind the monitor, chaka calls out }
<C>__{chaka}
<D>__{action!}
<A>__{jay and bob (as bluntman and chronic) look at each other for a beat. then }
<D>__{jay chronic uh snootchie bootchies.}
<A>__{suddenly, the wall to their left explodes. jay and bob hit the deck. through the smoking rubble steps cock knocker the arch nemesis of bluntman and chronic. he's a normal looking man with huge, overgrown fists.}
<D>__{jay chronic what the fuck? cock knocker you thought i'd never find your precious bluntcave, did you, hemp knight? but now you and your sidekick are finally in the grasp of cock knocker! jay chronic why do they call you "cock knocker"?}
<A>__{cock knocker slams one of his huge fists into jay's balls. jay drops to his knees, wailing. cock knocker then pulls a vibrator looking device from his cape. he presses a button on it and a laser beam rises out of the vibrator, like a light saber.}
<D>__{cock knocker any last words before i bust your balls, bluntman?}
<A>__{silent bob quickly looks right, then left. his eyes fall on a wall of armaments, on which hands a silver bong, under the placard: bong saber extremely experimental. do not use. it's out of his reach. silent bob closes his eyes, concentrating. he reached his hand out to the bong saber, attempting the jedi mind trick. suddenly, the bong snaps from the armory into bob's grip. the bong saber blasts to life and bob strikes a defensive pose. bob rushes the astonished cock knocker and the pair start light saber dueling.}
<C>__{chaka}
<P>__{(from behind monitor)}
<D>__{damn! now that was one special effect! this picture's gonna make house party look like house party two!}
<C>__{a.d.}
<D>__{or house party three?}
<C>__{chaka}
<D>__{shut the fuck up!}
<A>__{cock knocker battles bob back. he vogues some impressive blade handling, prompting bob to make a run for it up the ladder of the bong reactor and over cock knocker's head. he lands behind cock knocker, striking another pose. cock knocker then high kicks bob in the face, knocking him on his ass across the floor. cock knocker rushers over to deliver a saber kill shot, when we hear }
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{yo bitch fists!}
<A>__{cock knocker turns to see jay, standing on the rotating monitor station, holding a double sided saber. he clicks it and two beams emit (a la the darth maul light saber in episode one).}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{call me darth balls. bunngg.}
<A>__{jay leaps at cock knocker, wielding the double beamed bong saber.}
<C>__{chaka}
