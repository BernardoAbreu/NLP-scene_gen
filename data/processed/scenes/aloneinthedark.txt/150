<L>__{interior mine entrance hall 163}
<A>__{agent miles and agent feenstra are barricaded behind an old mining vehicle. the bodies of dead agents lie around them. agent feenstra bleeds from the wound in her thigh. the lights on their rifles are the only lights in the hall. an invisible creature jumps out at them, knocking debris out of the way as it charges. agent miles rolls away at the last second as the creature slams into the old mining vehicle. agent feenstra spins around and empties her last clip into the creature, killing it.}

<C>__{agent miles}
<D>__{i die fighting or i don't die at all.}
<A>__{agent miles opens fire into the night. his bullets glow as they streak through the air. feenstra picks herself up and opens fire alongside him. creatures squeal in the distance as the bullets find their marks. feenstra empties out her last magazine. an invisible creature leaps over the barricade and pounces on feenstra, tearing into her. miles shoots at the creature, emptying his last magazine. but he's too late to save feenstra. her torn up body slumps against their barricade agent miles is alone. he is out of ammunition. he pulls the trigger futilely. miles stands firm. he flips up his visor. miles closes his eyes. he is hoisted into the air by an invisible creature and thrown to the ground. invisible creatures tear him apart.}
