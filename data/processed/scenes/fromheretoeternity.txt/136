<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior general's office day}
<B>__{medium shot general slater colonel williams holmes}
<A>__{the american flag, the general's flag and the division flag are the only colorful elements in a rather severe office. colonel williams is reading from a typed report.}
<C>__{colonel williams}
<D>__{ in addition to inefficiency in administering his command and neglect of duty, captain holmes has been guilty of indefensible cruelty to the aforesaid private prewitt. this extended to instigating and encouraging wholly unauthorized and discreditable tactics to force the soldier to join the inter regiment boxing team. these findings are the result of personal investigation by the inspector general and are corroborated by numerous members of g company.}
<A>__{colonel williams puts his report on the general's desk. holmes' face reflects a weary resignation as if underneath he has really expected something like this for a long time. he makes no move to speak. the general is angry clear through.}
<C>__{general slater}
<D>__{i'm waiting for your reply to this.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i haven't any, sir... the charges are true.}
<C>__{general slater}
<D>__{holmes, the first thing i ever learned in the army was that an officer takes care of his men. it seems to be the first thing you forgot. it's monstrous to think of anybody like you in command of troops. and believe me, you won't be for long. my only regret is that we have to keep you in uniform until a court martial is concluded.}
<C>__{general slater}
<D>__{in the meantime, of course, i'm relieving you of your present duties.}
<A>__{he indicates the meeting is over. holmes rises, is about to leave, pauses.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{if there were any way to avoid a court martial, sir. any way...}
<A>__{the general frowns, is unresponsive. holmes looks to colonel williams helplessly.}
<C>__{colonel williams}
<D>__{there is one alternative, general... if you're so disposed. a resignation for the good of the service under ar 600 275.}
<C>__{general slater}
<P>__{(thinks a moment)}
<D>__{i will give you a chance you don't deserve, holmes. write a letter of resignation and have it on my desk this afternoon. i will consider accepting it. only because as far as i'm concerned, the quicker you're out of the army the better for everybody. especially the army.}
