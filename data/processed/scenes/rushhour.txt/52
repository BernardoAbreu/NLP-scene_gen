<A>__{under the mercedes, the device javal planted there begins to emit thick, white cs tear gas.}
<L>__{interior mercedes day}
<A>__{the gas pours in through the ventilation system. everyone inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably. the driver grabs his amd 74 machine gun and pops the door locks.}

<A>__{the driver, mrs. han, joy, sam and lisa pile out of the car. jittering with excitement, fear and speed, javal hops out of his van, holding a benelli m 1, a semi automatic shotgun. he shoots the driver in the chest. the blast from the shotgun muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it is blindingly bright, even in broad daylight, belching a huge cluster of glowing, white hot magnesium. the driver flies back against the mercedes, emptying his machine gun into the air. the wound in his chest is full of burning magnesium shrapnel.}

<A>__{the other drivers in the intersection see this and go completely nuts. some duck for cover under their dashboards. others peel away. a few collide with oncoming traffic. the carpool lady in the cherokee pushes the kids down on the floor. the fruit vendor hides by rolling under a car. sam and joy are incapacitated by tear gas coughing fits. mrs. han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away. javal punches her, knocking her down. he turns to lisa, surprised to see her. sweating, he points the shotgun at her... almost pulls the trigger... then notices mrs. han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it. he spots a motorist in a ford escort, peering cautiously over his dashboard to get a look at the action. javal shoots the motorist through the windshield with another bright, searing blast of magnesium. the motorist and the entire front of his car burst into flames. mrs. han is on her knees, sobbing. javal grabs her by the arm and pulls her to the back of the van. he opens the doors.}
