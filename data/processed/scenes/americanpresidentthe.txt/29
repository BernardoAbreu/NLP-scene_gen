<L>__{interior the billiard room night}
<A>__{shepherd has converted one of the rooms on the second floor residence. his expert shot demonstrates that playing pool is something he does almost as well as being president. a.j. stands to the side with his pool cue.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{mcsorley, mccluskey and shane know we're making our move on the crime bill. they're circling the wagons on the assault weapons.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{should i meet with them?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{let lewis take a pass at them first.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{fine. 2 in the side.}
<A>__{shepherd sends the two ball flying into the corner pocket.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{nice shot, mr. president.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{nice shot, mr. president? you won't call me by my name when we're playing pool.}
<A>__{a.j. assesses the table.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{i will not do it playing pool, i will not do it in a school, i do not like green eggs and ham, i do not like them sam i am.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{at ease, a.j., and get away from the pocket. 9 in the corner.}
<A>__{shepherd makes the shot.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{leo solomon phoned. he said he was thrilled with the deal you made this morning.}
<A>__{shepherd lifts his cue for a moment...trying to think it there was something he was supposed to tell a.j.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i forgot to tell you.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{it's a waste of time.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{not our time. gdc makes a big push for the votes, and when they come up short, we move in with the softer bill, to get passed, we're everybody's hero. 3 in the side.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{also, sydney wade called.}
<A>__{shepherd, a hair too excited by this news, misses by a mile.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{sydney wade?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{she wanted to apologize one more time for her behavior. 3 in the side.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{did she say anything about me?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sydney wade?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{when she called.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{did she say anything about you? 13 in the corner.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{no, it's just that we had a nice couple of minutes together. she threatened me and i patronized her and we didn't have anything to eat, but i thought there was a connection.}
<A>__{a.j. is staring at him in disbelief.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{she didn't say anything about me?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{well, no, but i could pass her a note before study hall and }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{tell me this: hypothetically, what would happen }
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{i feel a nightmare coming on. 1 in the corner.}
<A>__{he misses the shot.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{ if i called sydney and asked her to be my date at the state dinner thursday night?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{you're not serious.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{don't i sound serious?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{the president can't just go out on a date.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{why not? jefferson did. wilson did.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{you're not }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{wilson was widowed during his first term. he meets a woman named edith gault. he dated her, courted her, married her, and somewhere in there managed to form the league of nations.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{mr. president, this is an election year. if you're looking for female companionship, we can make arrangements that'll insure total privacy and }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i don't want you to get me a girl, a.j. what is this, vegas?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{no, sir, this is the white house.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{and i'm talking about something that in no way is at conflict with my oath of office. i'm a single adult, and i met a woman that i'd like to see again socially. how's that different from what wilson did?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{the difference is he didn't have to be the president on television. you've said it a million times: if there were a television set in every living room 60 years ago, this country does not elect a man in a wheelchair.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{we'll take a hit.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{how big?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{i don't know. five points. maybe more.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{five points we're standing here talking about?!}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{it could be more.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i drop five points when wisconsin doesn't make it to the rose bowl. 5 in the corner.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{do you want me to have kodak put together some numbers so we know what we're talking about?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no. no. i don't want to check a polling sample to see if this is okay, like i'm asking permission to stay out an hour past curfew. this isn't the business of the american people.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{mr. president, the american people have a funny way of deciding on their own what is and what is not their business.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i like her, a.j.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{stop being my chief of staff for one minute.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{give her a call.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{janie!}
<P>__{(to a.j.)}
<D>__{she didn't say anything about me?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{she said you're taller than she thought you'd be.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{that's something.}
<A>__{janie enters }
<C>__{janie}
<D>__{yes, sir?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i need you to track down a phone number.}
