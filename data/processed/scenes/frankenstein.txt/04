<A>__{arctic twilight total, stunning silence. a glittering wasteland of ice. breathlessly cold. even the sun seems frozen, barely hanging on the horizon. pellets of snow scour the permafrost like broken glass, driven by a desolate arctic wind. it's as if hell had erupted through the floor of the earth in the form of ice. nothing could survive here. nothing. slow pan reveals a distant ship frozen in the ice, tilted at a permanent list. silent. we see no signs of life. supe title: "the arctic, 1839." various lingering angles provide ominous detail shots of the nevsky a flap of frozen canvas creaks in the wind... the pilot's wheel is now a crystalline sculpture of ice. the forward mast lies across the deck like a broken limb, extending out over the ice on a tangle of rigging... the ship's prow is smashed open above the water line... a familiar rosary lies broken on the deck. beads scattered. |a tiny christ figure lies with arms thrown wide, painted eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet of ice... high, high angle from the top of mast #2. a breathtaking perspective of the entire ship below, guaranteed to induce vertigo. the corpse of the lookout is suspended below us at the end of the frozen rope, his posture mimics the christ figure: his arms thrown wide, dead eyes staring up at the sky through a thin sheet of ice. a ghastly still life, the corpse twisting ever so slightly on the wind, rope creaking... a sailor thrusts into frame swaying precariously in the rigging, widen to reveal two more men as they reach out with long gaffing poles to snag the corpse.}
