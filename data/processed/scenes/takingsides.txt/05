<L>__{interior ruined cinema day}
<A>__{dark. on a screen: scenes from leni riefenstahl's triumph of the will. over this:}
<C>__{a man's voice}
<D>__{look at them. men, women, kids. boy, did they love him. you see, steve, adolf hitler touched something deep, real deep and savage and barbaric, and it won't just go away overnight. it's got to be rooted out. you know what i think? i think they were all nazis. and let's face it, their leaders, those bastards now on trial in nuremberg, couldn't have done it alone. it's these people, they gave all the help that was needed. willingly.}
<A>__{the film changes with a scratchy music soundtrack wagner. shots of high ranking nazis in an audience including josef goebbels, listening. and they're listening to and watching wilhelm furtwangler conducting. at the appropriate moment:}
<C>__{the man's voice}
<D>__{that's him. furtwangler. wilhelm furtwangler.}
<A>__{the nazis applaud. goebbels shakes hands with furtwangler. the film ends. sitting in the ruined cinema are two men: general wallace, with files on the table, and, beside him, major steve arnold. a projectionist is standing in the door of the projection room.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{so, you never heard of him.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{do you know who arturo toscanini is?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{he's as big as toscanini, maybe even bigger. in this neck of the woods, he's probably bob hope and betty grable rolled into one.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{jeez, and i never heard of him.}
<A>__{wallace glances at the file.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{you were in insurance before the war.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{right. claims assessor.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{conscientious, determined, dogged.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{they said i was dogged?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.}
<P>__{(looks up at steve.)}
<D>__{now we can't take every nazi in this country to trial, although i would like to; it's an impossibility. so we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{like this bandleader.}
<C>__{wallace}
<P>__{(a smile)}
<D>__{well, he's more than just a bandleader, steve. he's a great conductor, a gifted artist. but we believe that he sold himself to the devil. your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the nazi party. don't be impressed by him. i want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. find wilhelm furtwangler guilty. he represents everything that was rotten in germany.}
<A>__{steve wants to rise, but wallace puts a hand on his shoulder to make him sit again.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{stay put, steve. there is some other stuff that i'd like for you to see here. background.}
<A>__{he nods to the projectionist, then starts to go, but stops.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{oh, one thing that may be a problem. our occupation authorities in wiesbaden have a duty to help these poor unfortunates with their defence. they keep repeating: 'we must be just, we must be seen to be just.' well, i've only one thing to say to the liberals in wiesbaden: fuck 'em.}
<P>__{(as he goes)}
<D>__{you answer to no one but me. is that understood?}
<P>__{(to the projectionist in the door)}
<D>__{show him the film.}
<C>__{projectionist}
<D>__{yes, sir. roll it.}
<A>__{wallace goes. the projectionist starts the next reel. on the screen: a berlin sequence. bombs falling. ruins, a city devastated, empty. flags of the four allied nations. posters of truman, stalin, churchill.}
<C>__{archive film voice}
<D>__{that is the hand that dropped the bombs on defenceless rotterdam, brussels, belgrade. that is the hand that destroyed the cities, villages and homes of russia. that is the hand that held the whip over the polish, yugoslav, french and norwegian slaves. that is the hand that took their food.}
<A>__{steve watches expressionless.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{next reel, please.}
<A>__{on the screen: shots of camp survivors. then shots of emaciated corpses being bulldozed into mass graves.}
<C>__{archive film}
<D>__{sanitary conditions were so appalling that heavy equipment had to be brought in to speed the work of cleaning up. this was bergen belsen.}
<A>__{the moment this appears, steve rises and goes quickly. on the screen: piles of cadavers.}
