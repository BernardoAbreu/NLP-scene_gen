<C>__{lauren}
<D>__{are you acting like this because of the wedding? tell me the truth?}
<C>__{harley}
<P>__{(head down)}
<D>__{not at all. swear to god.}
<C>__{lauren}
<D>__{because i don't want to be one of those couples where the guy goes into a coma the whole time we plan the wedding. it's not worth it to me.}
<A>__{harley looks up, sees the hotel doc walk by the reception clerk. the doc gives her a wink and a "thumbs up" and keeps on walking.}

<A>__{oprah close on tv in jane and jake's room. reverse jane and jake sitting up in bed, in their robes, watching oprah and eating chicken soup on trays. jake reaches for the salt. jane eases it away from him. jake looks over at jane, oozing with love and appreciation.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{see. just that move...you have no idea. not everyone's like that...}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(mutes oprah, then:)}
<D>__{jake, i have a confession to make. back when we broke up... i knew it wasn't all your fault.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you mean that? you've never said that to me before.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i know. because when you cheated, i didn't have to. but i think in some way, i gave up on us and i'm not sure you ever really did.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i still haven't.}
<A>__{jake takes jane's hand. she looks down at his wedding ring, then turns her eyes back to oprah. a beat, then:}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{are you and agness... still having sex?}
<A>__{jake doesn't answer. jane turns, looks right at him.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{only if she initiates it.}
<A>__{jane groans.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i'm trying not to rock the boat at home until you and i figure this out.}
<P>__{(sees her reaction)}
<D>__{this is a little trickier at my end than yours.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{right. yeah. okay....}
<P>__{(rises...)}
<D>__{now i know you're gonna think i'm leaving because of what you just said, but i'm not. i really have to get back to work.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(takes jane's hand)}
<D>__{we got really close there for a moment.}
<A>__{she knows he's right. jane's cell rings. she lets it ring again, then answers it.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(into phone)}
