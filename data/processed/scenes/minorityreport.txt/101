<L>__{interior a wealthy home subburian washington night}
<A>__{senator malcolm releases a self satisfied little belch as he finishes off a late night whiskey in his panelled den. he wanders about admiring himself in the many political photos adorning the cherry wood walls. he's feeling cozy and safe, the way rich people can afford to. no identiscan spiders would ever be sent under his doors. no intrusions of any sort, nothing that a coiffed secretary or a loyal wife wouldn't announce before hand. which is why he doesn't immediately understand the small sound at ear level, coming from just behind him. it's a metallic click click. he turns amiably. his eyes instantly widen, and his knees buckle when he sees he's looking into the barrel of anderson's cocked gun.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{time to upgrade your alarm system, senator.}
<A>__{senator malcolm tries to regain his composure. his fear embarrasses him.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{your work up of witwer. the security panel would've done one.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why do i kill witwer?}
<A>__{the senator finds his voice.}
<C>__{senator malcolm}
<D>__{there's no motive.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{there's, always a motive.}
<A>__{anderson presses the gun to the senator's forehead. he slides the barrel tip back and forth across the senator's sweaty skin. it makes a greasy red mark.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{i could've come to anyone on the panel. but i picked you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{of all the shits on that panel, i like you least of all. so if this gun goes off, i will feel bad, but not, you know, devastated.}
<A>__{you can almost see a thought dawning on senator malcolm. and then, shockingly he spits in anderson's face, and turns and walks to the other side of the den. his tone is mocking.}
<C>__{senator malcolm}
<D>__{what the fuck was i worried about? you can't kill me. the precogs would've seen it.}
<A>__{anderson realizes this, too, lowers his gun. the senator is even laughing now. for a moment anderson does nothing, then he moves toward the senator again. the senator stands his ground smugly.}
<C>__{senator malcolm }
<D>__{witwer's clean. you're clean. there's nothing. no motive. kind of like something kafka would've cooked up.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you like that, cockroach? you're fucked and you'll never know why.}
<A>__{the senator is laughing hard now. anderson lets him.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{tell you something about the precogs, senator. they're great on murder. but it's the little things they fail to see.}
<A>__{anderson hits the senator so hard it bounces him across the floor and into the cherry wood panelling. several of his beloved photos crash down onto him.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{little things like that, for instance.}
<A>__{anderson steps over him, and walks out of the room}
