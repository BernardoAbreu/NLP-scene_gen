<A>__{the door at the end screeches open and milt, still holding the shotgun at port arms, comes cautiously in. this place is really overgrown. milt advances slowly into the jungle of plants, and the director will shoot it as he likes to build the suspense. i'm sure that plants brush his face, and a bug or two maybe even a big plump spider will land on him. he hears a scuttering sound and whirls.}
