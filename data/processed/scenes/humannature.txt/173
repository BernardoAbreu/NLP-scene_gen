<A>__{puff is in his case in formal evening wear in a makeshift opera box. there is a mannequin woman sitting next to him and a boom box pumping out beethoven's fidelio. puff seems attentive, refined, occasionally bringing a pair of opera glasses up to his eyes, pinky extended. outside the case, nathan and lila look on. the opera is over. puff stands, applauds, yells "bravo", and tosses a rose in the direction of the imaginary stage. the rose hits the lucite wall and falls to the floor. nathan and lila stand and applaud puff.}

<D>__{bravo to you, puff!}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{that was wonderful!}
<A>__{puff smiles and performs a foppish bow, almost a curtsy. he picks up the rose, sniffs it, dramatically savoring its scent.}
