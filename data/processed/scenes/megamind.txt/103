<L>__{exterior another bar day}
<A>__{titan emerges with brad and frank. he's holding a beer can and a bag of pork rinds.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{alright, i want this whole thing to look espn professional, understand?}
<A>__{a distant mechanized rumble can be heard. the noise rises, signaling the approach of something powerful. titan and his crew walk out to the center of the plaza as the sound becomes almost deafening.}
<B>__{a tank track}
<A>__{as it moves over the street. we pull back to see a whole line of tanks rolling along the street.}
<B>__{plaza}
<A>__{from the five streets branching off the plaza, a dozen tanks roll toward titan. titan turns to brad and frank.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{you guys are about to get some good footage. i might need a little room, though.}
<A>__{brad and frank look at each other and run to take cover behind a nearby building. meanwhile, titan nonchalantly sips from his beer as the tanks begin to surround them. feedback belts out of one of the tank's loudspeaker's, causing titan to do a mock wince.}
<C>__{tank loudspeaker}
<D>__{titan, we have orders from the city of metro to take you into custody. if you do not give your self up willingly, we will be forced to open fire.}
<A>__{there's a long pause as no one says anything.}
<C>__{tank loudspeaker}
<D>__{what is your answer?}
<A>__{titan takes a sip of his beverage and unleashes a gigantic burp the shockwave of which sends several of the tanks flying into a nearby building. two of the remaining tanks close in on the villain. both have him dead to rights at point blank range with their massive guns. titan sets down his beer, then calmly plugs a fist into each barrel. they fire. the force of the blast sends them both flying in opposite directions where they crash into nearby buildings. titan bends down and pick his beet back up.}
<C>__{titan}
<P>__{(to beer)}
<D>__{miss me?}
<A>__{titan is suddenly bombarded by a massive barrage of machine gun fire. the force sends him flying into the windshield of a nearby car. he looks up to see an apache assault copter. it's nose mounted gatling gun is turning toward him. titan gets up to his feet and looks down at his beer can. the bottom of it was blown apart in the blast.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{didn't mean to get you involved in all of this.}
<A>__{he stared daggers up at the helicopter pilot just as the gun gets a bead on him.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{hey, man! you killed my suds!}
<A>__{titan throws the can up and slaps it with the palm of his hand. it flies with so much force it knocks the helicopter blade clean off. the rest of the apache crashes to the street like a car dropped off a building.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{that's one was for you, beer.}
<A>__{titan salutes the wreckage and walks away to find brad and frank still hiding behind the building.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{guys, please tell me you got that last bit.}
<C>__{brad helms}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{you're kidding me. i give you my sexiest moves and you mean to tell me it was for nothing?}
<C>__{brad helms}
<D>__{we were afraid something might hit us.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{looks like i've given the story of the century to the wrong man.}
<A>__{he thinks about this for a moment, then it hits him.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{wait. what about that other reporter. blond. not so lumpy on the topper half, but killer legs.}
<C>__{brad helms}
<D>__{roxanne. you want roxanne. she's a much better reporter than i am. you want her.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{where can i find her.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we're actually not supposed to give out that sort of information.}
<C>__{brad helms}
<D>__{1314 mockingbird lane. i believe she lives in a penthouse.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{you've been very helpful.}
<A>__{he tosses brad over his shoulder like a discarded ice cream cone. in the faint distance we see him splash down in the middle of the metro city river.}
