<L>__{ext amsterdam street later}
<A>__{they start to walk. gus takes a cigarette out of his pack, sticks it between his lips. hazel notices he's struggling with something.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{augustus?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{there's something i have to tell you...}
<A>__{they walk in silence a few beats.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{just before you went into the hospital... there was this... i felt this... ache in my hip.}
<A>__{hazel grabs onto his arm, a lump already forming.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{oh no...}
<A>__{gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth, clenches his teeth tightly, trying not to cry.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i had a pet scan.}
<A>__{gus sits down on a bench. looks up at her. tries to smile. before he even says it, she knows.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{it lit up like a christmas tree, hazel...}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{oh god.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{the lining of my chest, my liver... everywhere.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{oh my god no!}
<A>__{hazel loses it in that moment, falling on top of him, hugging him for dear life, her head in his lap.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i'm so sorry, augustus. i'm so so sorry }
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i'm sorry too }
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{it's so unfair }
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i should have told you }
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{it's so fucking unfair!}
<A>__{a beat. gus still trying not to cry.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{apparently the world is... not a wish granting factory.}
<A>__{and at that point, gus lets it go, lets himself cry and be sad and feel awful. but just for a second. then he shakes it off, pulls hazel's face up to his, tries again to smile through the tears.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{don't you worry about me, hazel grace. i will find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time.}
<A>__{she hugs him, perhaps a little too tightly. he winces.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{does it hurt?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{it's ok.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm ok.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{but of course it's not ok. not by a mile. hazel takes a moment to look at him, touches his cheek.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i'm just... i'm very fond of you.}
<A>__{he grabs her hand and holds it.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i don't suppose you can forget about it, treat me like i'm not dying.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i don't think you're dying, augustus. you've just got a touch of cancer.}
<A>__{gus nods. squeezes her hand.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{would it be absolutely ludicrous to make out right now?}
<A>__{hazel doesn't answer. she just kisses him, hard. and on the two of them, so in love, we cut to:}
