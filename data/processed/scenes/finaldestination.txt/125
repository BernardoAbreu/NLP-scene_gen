<D>__{we're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.}
<P>__{(to carter)}
<D>__{keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.}
<A>__{carter, however, continually glances into the rearview mirror, checking alex. finally, hotheaded and unable to withhold it any further...}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{alright, browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about ms. lewton, or what?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{why do you think i was hiding?}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{billy told the f.b.i. he saw you runnin' away from her house.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{they blame me for everything. her, tod, the plane crash...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{your shoe prints were in the blood. your fingerprints on the knives...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i already told you...}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i'm not talkin' about if you did it. or if you knew she was dead...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{did you know she was going to be nexterior.. before she was?}
<A>__{alex looks at clear, her expression asking the same question...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(almost to himself)}
<D>__{when she died... at that moment, i could tell she saw something... horrible.}
<A>__{the three others turn quiet, considering what it must be...}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{out of us... who's next to see it?}
<A>__{alex eyes them... hesitant to respond.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{please tell me i'm gonna get to see the jets win the super bowl.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{me, right? that's why you're not saying.}
<A>__{billy looks out the window, despondent.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{shoulda felt up tammy in the pool, that time...}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(to billy)}
<D>__{whatta you whinin' about? he said i'm nexterior}

<C>__{carter}
<D>__{you have a responsibility to tell me.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{is knowing going to make it easier? it makes it harder.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{you get off havin' control over me. let me choose how to deal with it.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it doesn't matter who's nexterior.. we're all on the same list.}
<A>__{the three are silent.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{aww, fuck... really?}
<A>__{carter's expression becomes frightened, but he cannot have this. he counters with an irrational bravado.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{then why bother? what's the fuckin' point? terry and me will be back together on the other side, so why wait any longer?}
<A>__{carter bares down on the wheel, hits the gas...}
