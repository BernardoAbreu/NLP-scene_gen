<L>__{interior baptist hospital afternoon}
<A>__{barbara jean is in bed. a doctor is there, along with a crowd of publicity people and well wishers, including: triplette, reese, bud. barnett hovers over barbara jean. the atmosphere is stifling.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{barbara, i'd like to talk to you and barnett alone.}
<C>__{barnett}
<D>__{anything you say.}
<A>__{he turns to the visitors.}
<C>__{barnett}
<D>__{doctor says you'll have to go on out now}
<A>__{there are tones of disappointment, most of them are very involved in their own conversations. triplette walks toward the bed, but can't really get close enough. he finally captures barnett as the people start to leave.}
<C>__{triplette}
<D>__{excuse me, barnett, how's she doing?}
<A>__{barnett turns and studies him for a moment as though he remembers who he is. he doesn't.}
<C>__{triplette}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i feel as if i know you. i'm john triplette... a friend of del reese... i was at the airport. i just wanted to introduce myself. i'm a great fan of hers. if there's anything you need, just give me a call. i'm at the sheraton south.}
<C>__{barnett}
<D>__{she's going to rest now.}
<C>__{triplette}
<D>__{okay, i just wanted to see if i could help out at all.}
<A>__{the crowd is almost out of the room now. we see glenn there as he steps into the hallway.}
<C>__{barnett}
<D>__{i appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.}
<C>__{triplette}
<D>__{oh, sure.}
<A>__{he stands there too long.}
<C>__{barnett}
<D>__{what do you really want?}
<C>__{triplette}
<D>__{not a thing, barnett, really. i need a little information. but, ah, it can wait.}
<C>__{barnett}
<D>__{you bet.}
<C>__{triplette}
<D>__{okay. thanks.}
<A>__{barnett says "you bet" again and closes the door after triplette. barnett returns to the bed with barbara jean and the doctor.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{well, it's exhaustion, pure and simple, and you're going to have to take a rest or you're going to be in big trouble.}
<C>__{barnett}
<D>__{she has to be at the opera tomorrow night and then she can go home.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{she's not going anywhere, barnett. this is precisely what i'm talking about. she is collapsing. she cannot go on without a rest or she will have to stop altogether for a long time.}
<C>__{barbara jean}
<D>__{well, i have to go: it's too late to be replaced, and, besides, i just can't do that. those people get disappointed. they've come in from all over, you know, and this miss foxy who's been writing to me for years is going to be there from michigan.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{you cannot leave this bed until i say so. the two of you have to understand that. barnett, you've got to stop this dovetailing and give her some rest. you don't need to make that much more money.}
<C>__{barnett}
<D>__{it's not the money. the friends and neighbors love her and they want to see her. we got a debt to the public.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{well, they are not going to see her tomorrow night, and i suggest you get on the phone and make the necessary arrangements.}
