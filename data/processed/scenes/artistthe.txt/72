<L>__{interior george's house (1931) day}
<D>__{crossfade to a man's pair of shoes with used heels and uppers. george's dog comes to sit at his feet. the date is superimposed on the screen: 1931. the camera climbs up his legs to reveal george lying fully dressed in his bed, obviously at home in view of his attitude. he's changed. and even if his suit is still pretty smart, he's become more "common", less unattainable. he seems to have lost whatever it was that made him so superb. primarily he's a bit drunk, somewhat hesitant. george gets up and closes his murphy bed, the kind of bed that slots up into the wall to look like a closet. then he walks across the living area. his home has changed too, it's fallen in class and is a lot more modest than the one we were used to seeing him in. we do however recognize some of the objects, furniture and paintings from his old house, notably the huge portrait of him smiling. he goes into the kitchen which is open onto the rest of the apartment. there's nothing in the refrigerator. he looks for something to drink but there's only one bottle left in the rack. he lifts it up. it's empty. he opens a closet. inside, a tuxedo hangs among a number of bare hangers.}
