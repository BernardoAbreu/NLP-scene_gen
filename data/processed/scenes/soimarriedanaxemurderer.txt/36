<B>__{alcatraz}
<A>__{we open on the loud banging of a cell door. we find our tour group in the holding area. the park ranger is a beefy man in his late fifties and talks with emotionless, military precision.}
<C>__{park ranger}
<D>__{hello, everyone i'm a park ranger and i will be leading you on the tour. all the park rangers here at alcatraz were at one time guards, myself included. my name is john johnson, but everyone here calls me vicki. will you please follow me?}
<A>__{they are led out. we see that alcatraz is a sinister place. cold and unforgiving. the park ranger leads them to the center of a cell block.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{you're glowing, charlie. the man's in love.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{sssh... stop it. i'm trying to listen.}
<C>__{park ranger}
<D>__{this is the main cell block area. home to such famous criminals as al capone, micky cohen, joseph "dutch" critzer, and robert stroud, the famous bird man of alcatraz. follow me, please.}
<A>__{the park ranger leads them past the famous visiting rooms, the mess hall, all the way to the solitary confinement area.}
<B>__{a cell}
<C>__{park ranger}
<D>__{this is the cell for solitary confinement, that over the years has come to be known as times square.}
<A>__{tony and charlie are at the back of the tour group.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{so did you and harriet?... you know...}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{sssh i don't want to talk about it.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{with that look, you don't have to talk about it. the grin alone could get you five to seven years.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{tony, get your mind out of the gutter. all you need to know is that she's a sweet, kind and loving person.}
<C>__{park ranger}
<D>__{now this is something none of the other tour guides will tell you. in this particular cell block machine gunn kelly had, what we call in the prison system, a "bitch." and one day, in a jealous rage, kelly took a makeshift knife, or "shiv," and cut out his "bitch's" eyes.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{look, what can i tell you. i'm smitten. i'm in deep smit. i dunno. i just don't wanna talk about it, because then i start analyzing and that's not good for me.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{good. i think that's good. just let it happen.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{exactly. that's what's gonna be different this time. something strange happens, let it go. it's not my business... like ralph. she says ralph in her sleep.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{who's ralph?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't know who ralph is. moreover, i don't want to know.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{park ranger}
<D>__{and as if blinding his "bitch" wasn't enough retribution for kelly, the next day he and four other inmates took turns pissing into the "bitch's" ocular cavity.}
<A>__{tony and charlie look at each other. they're a little queasy.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{exactly.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tony, i'm happy. don't let me screw this one up.}
