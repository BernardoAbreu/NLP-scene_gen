<L>__{exterior earth day (12,000 b.c.)}
<A>__{the world turns below us, vast and slow. a rumble. a shadow sweeps over the land. we move with the shadow. we cast the shadow. landscapes slide by. reduced by altitude to abstractions: river deltas, forests and flood plains. a raw natural world. no trace of civilization. the shadow glides over mountains and glaciers. across an ocean and a pale beach. over lowland plain at the foot of a volcanic mountain it stops.}
<L>__{exterior lowland plain day}
<A>__{three figures walk out of the shadow. they are men and yet not men. their skin is snow white. their features heavy and classical as if rodin's thinker had risen from his seat. their smooth heads are earless and hairless. their glittering eyes entirely black. against the stark land their height is impossible to judge. they are engineers. two of them are cloaked in dark robes of strange design. the third is naked. one of the cloaked engineers opens a featureless black box: inside lies a cake of dark, sticky material. the naked one lifts the dark cake with ceremonial slowness. it hums and buzzes. foams into iridescent spheres. he raises the seething cake to his mouth like the sacrament. black scarabs boil out of the dark material. swarm over his lips. glittering insects that chitter and bite. under the swarm his lips melt away. a horrific vision of teeth, black blood, dissolving bone. they are devouring him.}
<T>__{flash on:}
<A>__{a fevered glimpse of the microscopic: cells rupture and bleed. protein chains unfold. a dna spiral unravels. the scarabs fill their bellies with genetic material.}
<C>__{the engineer}
<A>__{...spreads his arms. stands cruciform, nearly headless. the scarabs swarm his shoulders, his chest. when they reach his hips, he collapses sideways, toppling majestically like a felled tree. engulfed. the two cloaked engineers watch impassively. behind them, a vast black ship hangs in the sky. as if blown by a great gust of wind, the scarabs disperse in their millions in all directions. living dna on the wing. where the sacrificial victim fell, nothing remains.}
<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{a pristine wilderness. the volcanic mountain in the distance. a primitive woman stands on a height, staring in amazement: far off a great dark ship hovers over the plain. a black scarab lands on the back of her neck. bites deep. injecting its cargo of dna into her blood.}
<T>__{flash on:}
<A>__{a microscopic invasion. cells pierced and infused. dna strands twining and mating.}
<B>__{close on the woman}
<A>__{pupils dilating with shock, breath hissing into her lungs. she slaps the back of her neck. looks at her hand. the scarab lies in her palm. as she watches, it crumbles to dust and blows away.}
<T>__{fade to black:}
<C>__{on black}
<A>__{drifting motes of light against the dark: a starscape. an excavator floats into view: a sturdy vehicle equipped with robotic arms. bright floodlights beat at the darkness. inside the cockpit a bubble of glass sits a beautiful woman. this is dr. jocelyn watts, 32, a precocious scholar of many disciplines. a scientist accustomed to field work. the cockpit is sweltering: she wears shorts, boots, a t shirt and still her arms and legs gleam with sweat. watts works the controls. the excavator descends toward a rocky surface. silt billows up as the excavator approaches: we're not in space at all, but deep underwater. the excavator's thrusters are cowled propellers. the "stars" are plankton shining in the floodlights.}
<L>__{interior excavator continuous}
<A>__{watts steers the excavator to a steeply sloping cliff wall. a sea trench yawns below her, its depths lost in darkness.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{moving to survey site b... closing on object four. the large oblong.}
<A>__{she watches the screen of a ground penetrating radar system. a bright signal return: something hidden in the cliff in front of her. something big.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{there you are.}
<L>__{exterior sea trench continuous}
<A>__{watts carves into the cliff with the excavator's digger arm. silt and boulders fall into the yawning trench below. she brings a water cannon to bear: uses its jet to blast away loose silt and stones. the cliff face collapses: a muddy landslide into the deeps. watts backs away from the collapse, thrusters whirring to keep her out of the turbulence. a cloud of silt clears. in her floodlight beams, the obelisk stands revealed its outlines worn by the ages. easily thirty feet tall. watts stares at the obelisk, stunned. her voice is husky:}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{martin. here.}
<A>__{a second excavator glides out of the dark. at the controls: professor martin holloway, 48, visionary genius and archaeologist. dark haired and lean, with the rangy build of a frontiersman. he's dressed in work trousers and a t shirt. stubbly chin. he plays his floodlights over the obelisk.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{look at that.}
<L>__{interior watts's excavator}
<A>__{watts floats her excavator down the front of the obelisk. scanning the alien texterior suddenly she stops. grips the obelisk with her excavator's arms to anchor herself in place.}

<D>__{coming.}
<L>__{exterior sea trench}
<A>__{holloway pilots his excavator expertly up to watts's. mates the two vehicles at their aft hatchways.}
<L>__{interior watts's excavator}
<A>__{behind watts, a hatch opens with a splatter of water. holloway climbs in. squeezes into her cockpit. a tight fit. he's distracted by her body, pressed so close but she has eyes only for the inscrutable writing outside the glass.}

<D>__{same thing again.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{what do you see?}

<D>__{hundreds of tons.}
<L>__{exterior mediterranean sea day}
<A>__{a research vessel at anchor on a turquoise sea. bright sun. in the distance, a coastline dotted with villas. the horizon is dominated by the volcanic peak the same peak we saw in the distance in the prologue. aboard the research vessel, cranes lift watts and holloway's excavators out of the sea and onto the deck.}
<L>__{interior research vessel aft deck day}
<A>__{under an awning, prints of the obelisk's faces are stretched on the deck fifteen feet long. watts and holloway crawl over the alien text, red markers in hand. parsing, translating, calculating. they're tanned, fit, the wind in their hair. the mediterranean coast in the distance. it's an idyllic way to work. but they're utterly absorbed in the task at hand. aft deck night they're still at it. lights illuminate the workspace. the obelisk prints are blanketed with markings and annotations. holloway sits at a table. watts sits on the marked up prints. both working through calculations on electronic slates. holloway looks up.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{i have a solution. a single match.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{me too. checked it twice.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{you first.}
<A>__{watts holds up her slate: it displays a set of stellar coordinates. a detailed star map. holloway holds up his own slate: an exact match. they lock eyes in electric excitement.}

<D>__{what do we do now?}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{we go there.}
<L>__{exterior weyland's wheel (earth orbit)}
<A>__{a gleaming space station like a five spoked wheel rotates grandly against the pacific ocean a thousand miles below. black letters on the white metal read: weyland's wheel. a round shuttlecraft approaches the station.}
<L>__{interior shuttlecraft (zero gravity)}
<A>__{a spacecraft no bigger than a private jet. holloway and watts sit strapped into acceleration chairs. the only two passengers aboard. new to space travel, watts tears her eyes from the spectacle of earth outside the window. holloway plays with a pen, batting it from hand to hand in the zero gravity.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{what's first? you do climate, i do genetics?}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{archaeology first. let our ancestors tell the tale.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{you think he's serious?}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{serious enough to send his private shuttle.}

<D>__{weyland can send his shuttle out for pizza.}
<P>__{(delicately)}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{martin. if this meeting goes like the others, maybe we should...}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{it won't go like the others.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<A>__{holloway plucks the pen from the air. he points out the window, where the crescent moon shines like a toothy grin.}

<A>__{the shuttle docks with the wheel's hub a perfect fit.}
<L>__{interior weyland's wheel spoke elevator (zero gravity)}
<A>__{a gleaming capsule elevator with windows to the stars. holloway and watts float weightlessly inside, moving from handhold to handhold. the door closes. watts grabs holloway by the collar. pulls them roughly together. they kiss. not for the first time. they have a way. watts's hair and clothing float free: she's a naiad in holloway's arms.}

<A>__{the elevator descends along the spoke to the rim.}
<L>__{interior weyland's wheel rim foyer}
<A>__{a luxurious lobby. tasteful lighting. eames era furniture in wood and chrome: the past's vision of the future. at the rim, the wheel's rotation supplies gravity. an elevator door opens. watts and holloway step out holloway with a sleek metal folio slung over his shoulder. the floor is the outer surface of the wheel: in both directions it curves upward out of sight. the walls are all windows: on one side, earth rotates lazily. on the other, a wheeling field of stars. david, an android, stands waiting for them. he's cunningly built, but no one would mistake him for a real human being.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{professor holloway. dr. watts. my name is david.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{hello, david.}

<C>__{weyland's office}
<A>__{peter weyland sits behind a mahogany desk. he's a warren buffet type: a country sage, horse sense and hard knocks. he might be seventy years old, or a hundred and seventy. behind him stands director lydia vickers, a slim woman of 45 in a costly business suit. shrewd and watchful. once a great beauty, she now trades in ruthlessness. david stands against the wall. watts and holloway settle into chairs in front of weyland holloway holding the metal folio.}

<A>__{holloway looks at him, startled.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{we sent you a prospectus that...}

<A>__{holloway swallows. lays the metal folio on weyland's desk.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{i'm an archaeologist.}
<A>__{he touches a tiny remote. holographs appear in the air over weyland's desk: the folio is a three dimensional imager. pictures of a younger holloway in the field: excavating ruins in egypt, china, peru, greece.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{in my studies i discovered a pattern i couldn't explain. every eleven hundred years, sudden advances in agriculture, tool use, technology. inventions. something caused a great leap forward. every eleven centuries. the pattern holds as far back as our data goes.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{tens of thousands of years. i had to understand this. it became the focus of my work.}
<A>__{weyland nods. holloway glances at watts and forges on.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{dr. watts was a student of mine.}
<A>__{watts touches her own remote. the holographic display turns to scientific diagrams. images of a very young and beautiful watts in the laboratory.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{i was analyzing historical changes in human dna. i found the same pattern. every eleven centuries, a pulse of new information in the genome of the human race. all over the world. evolution can't do that. something was changing us. changing the dna of our species.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{humanity's been visited. visited by...beings from somewhere else.}
<A>__{behind weyland, vickers can't suppress a scowl of disdain.}

<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{lydia vickers, director of operations. practically my right hand.}

<D>__{they guided us to civilization. lifted us up, again and again. i call them the engineers.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{once you know what you're looking for, it's amazing how the evidence falls into place.}
<A>__{photographs flicker through the display: holloway and watts in the field, excavating new sites. intimately close. their finds: columns of writing on stone tablets in egypt, china, cambodia, peru. patterns of lines, curves, and dots.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{this is the writing of the engineers. we've found it on every continent. and last year, we found our rosetta stone.}
<A>__{the display shows the engineer obelisk under the sea.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{the writing is a formula giving the location of a single star in our sky.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{which star?}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{we're keeping that confidential for now. but that's where we want to go.}

<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{it's a chance to be part of a revolution in scientific...}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{don't sell me, professor. you've been turned down by every university and government agency under the sun. nobody's going to gamble that kind of money on your hunch.}
<A>__{holloway deflates. watts winces. this is a bloodbath.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{nobody but me.}
<P>__{(he grins)}
<D>__{i've read your research.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{that's impossible. our research is }
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{quantum encoded on secure servers, yeah. we have an a.i. division, you should know. doing impressive things.}
<P>__{(he leans across the desk)}
<D>__{i know which star you're wishing on.}

<D>__{biotechnology was good to me. fusion power. lately doing well with gravity systems.}
<A>__{he swivels his chair toward the window. earth shines outside.}

<C>__{watts}
<D>__{he made the heaven and the earth.}
<A>__{weyland jabs a finger at her like she's won a carnival prize.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{that's what i'm talking about. you left out my favorite part. the piece about earth. david.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{for eons, earth's climate swung from hothouse to ice age. explosions of life, then mass extinctions. but twelve thousand years ago the swings stopped. the holocene epoch began a period of anomalous tranquility. the rise of civilization began only then.}
<A>__{holloway and watts stare at david with new appreciation.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{and that change coincides with a visit by the engineers. they didn't just change us. they changed our world.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{that's the piece i mean. engineering earth. god stuff.}
<A>__{he swivels back to his desk. rummages in a drawer.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{my people checked your science. they say it's solid.}
<A>__{he pulls a thick contract out. drops it in front of holloway.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{i will give you your expedition. ship and crew, supplies, support. one condition.}
<A>__{holloway picks up the contract with the cautious joy of a man double checking a lottery ticket. his voice is husky:}

<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{you get the discovery. control of the site. but any technology you find? anything at all. that's mine.}
<A>__{holloway reaches out slowly and picks up the contract. riffles the pages of small print legalese.}

<A>__{vickers stares at weyland in shock.}
<C>__{white landscape}

<L>__{exterior deep space}
<A>__{a black void shot with stars, far from any sun. a sturdy prospecting ship forges through space, travel worn but built to last. it carries the weyland industries logo. the name painted on its hull is magellan.}
<L>__{interior magellan bridge}
<A>__{the ship's nerve center and control room. six control stations, empty and quiet. interior lights dimmed to blue. the entire forward bulkhead of the bridge is a window: wall to wall, floor to ceiling. at the window stands the android david. he gazes at the cosmos with an expression of utter serenity. after a long moment he turns away. massive shutters close over the window as he walks off.}
<C>__{corridor}
<A>__{david walks the ship's long central corridor. the ship is silent. the lights dimmed to blue. he is alone.}
<C>__{hypersleep compartment}
<A>__{a long steel room containing a dozen plexiglass sarcophagi, six on each side. sleep freezers. inside each freezer: the shadowy shape of a human body rimed with frost. david walks through the compartment, surveying the sleepers.}

<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{give us a moment, will you?}

<C>__{david}
<D>__{your hypothesis is...bold. the audacity of it. your climate data's undeniable: the holocene epoch was engineered. dr. watts, your genetic studies are equally conclusive. pulses of cultural change are harder to prove, but even there your case is strong. i believe in your "engineers."}
