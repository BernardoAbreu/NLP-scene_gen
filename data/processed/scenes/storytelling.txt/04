<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{vi}

<C>__{vi}
<D>__{marcus...you'll write something better next time!}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{patronizing fuck! if you had just been honest with me in the first place i wouldn't have read it. i knew it was shit. but idiot! i believed you!}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{that's not fair! i was honest! just because i wasn't sucking up like that bitch catherine.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{well, i sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{i admit it i was scared! i was shocked, in fact , by what he said. and he's so...convincing. i'm sorry if i let you down, but really, i still say he's just one opinion. i don't even like his books that much. they're all so aggressively confrontational. i don't care if he's won the pulitzer prize.}
<A>__{catherine and mr scott walk by together in the distance.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you just want to fuck him. like catherine and every other white cunt on campus.}
