<D>__{mr. chairman, fellow delegates my distinguished colleague from italy. her majesty's delegation has listened with great patience to the southern european position on this problem, and while we find it charmingly stated, we cannot possibly agree with its content. in 1937, in the british colonies of kenya, uganda and tanganyika and, if i'm not mistaken, more or less in somaliland a programme of crop rotation was instituted vis a vis arable land which had never before known the plough, beginning before the soil was able to know the sort of fatigue now plaguing most of western europe. in 1937, therefore, her majesty's government at that time his majesty's government was able to properly assay the situation. we therefore oppose the resolution.}
