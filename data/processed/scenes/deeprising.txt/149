<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior vault room night}
<A>__{trillian steps up to the vault, looking around, a bit nervous, something is definitely not right here.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{helloooo?}
<A>__{she shrugs, must be her imagination. from inside her low cut dress she pulls the captain's gold security card. she is about to run it through the reader slot when...}
<B>__{v.o.}
<A>__{ahem... she spins to...hanover, mason, mamooli and chin. looking grim.}
<C>__{trillian}
<P>__{(recovering)}
<D>__{i'm sorry... this area is for authorized personnel only. as the assistant to the purser, i'm afraid i will have to ask you to vacate...}
<A>__{mason and chin lift their pulse rifles. kachunk!!}
<C>__{trillian }
<D>__{or maybe not.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{where is everybody?}
<A>__{trillian is confused }
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<A>__{hanover steps forward, right in her face.}
<C>__{hanover}
<P>__{(threatening)}
<D>__{i mean...where is everybody?}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{poolside?}
<A>__{hanover grabs trillian by the throat and slams her against the wall. he rams his gun against her forehead.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{you tell it straight or i pull the trigger. who are you?}
<C>__{trillian}
<P>__{(choking)}
<D>__{a passenger...}
<A>__{hanover blinks.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{where are the other passengers?}
<A>__{trillian shrugs. mason grabs the card out of her hand.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{forget her...let's get what we came for and get the hell out of here!}
<A>__{mason runs the card through the slot. the electronics kick in. lights flash. tumblers roll. click! it unlocks. hanover's headset comes alive with mulligan screaming.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{mulligan?? what?? i can't hear you?? repeat i...}
<A>__{ mason jerks the vault door open. a fire axe swing down into his head, whump! kills him instantly. eyes wide open. everybody freaks out. jumps back. hanover lets go of trillian, and stares into the vault directly at nigel canton. holding the axe.}
<C>__{canton}
<D>__{oh my god. i didn't mean to...}
<A>__{behind canton the captain is on the floor, in severe pain, his clothes are ripped up, revealing nasty looking red scars, blistered and puffy, all over his chest and arms.}
<C>__{canton }
<D>__{i thought it was one of them!}
<A>__{chin jams his rifle to the middle of canton's forehead, and cocks a round into the chamber.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{stand down soldier!}
<A>__{but this is one soldier who is slow to obey the order. hanover grabs chin by both shoulders and gives a colossal yank.}
<C>__{hanover }
<D>__{i said...}
<A>__{he slams chin against the wall. in the process he loses his headset.}
<C>__{hanover }
<D>__{stand down!!}
<A>__{chin and hanover stare at each other, their chests heaving. mason finally drops to the ground. all she wrote.}
<C>__{canton}
<D>__{i didn't mean to! i though it was one of them!}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{one of who?!}
