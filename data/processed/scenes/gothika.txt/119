<L>__{exterior barn later}
<A>__{miranda comes crashing out of the barn, doubles over and throws up. the bright light outside blinding her momentarily. her bloodshot eyes taking a moment to register }
<B>__{the patrol car}
<A>__{parked in front of the house. a police officer cautiously peering inside her stolen car. he looks up and notices her. miranda hesitates. nowhere to run. the officer waves. his name is turlington.}
<C>__{officer turlington}
<D>__{howdy there.}
<A>__{he says this while already strolling over. miranda's mind races a mile a minute }
<C>__{officer turlington}
<D>__{everything okay?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{y yes.}
<C>__{officer turlington}
<D>__{that your vehicle, ma'am?}
<A>__{she stares at the young, friendly cop. his left hand resting on his belt. right next to his gun. but it seems as if he has no idea who she is. at least not yet.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{yes i i just pulled over. i was looking for a bathroom. morning sickness, you know...}
<C>__{officer turlington}
<D>__{congratulations. but i'm afraid this is private property you can't just waltz on in. you understand that.}
<A>__{she nods, nerves shot to hell. starts walking.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i will be on my merry way now. my husband will never forgive me if i get a ticket for trespassing.}
<A>__{the cop nods at that, seeming to have a fair grasp of marital dynamics. he flashes a smile but suddenly stops, whips out his gun and trains it on her }
<C>__{officer turlington}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<P>__{(clicks the safety off)}
<D>__{lady, stay right where you are.}
<A>__{miranda shuts her eyes, busted. freezes.}
<C>__{officer turlington}
<D>__{hands up where i can see them.}
<A>__{miranda awkwardly raises her shaky hands.}
<C>__{officer turlington}
<D>__{nice and slow, start talking to me. and make it good. tell me just exactly who that is.}
<A>__{a confused miranda slowly turns in the direction he's looking to see tracy seaver at the barn door. dragging herself in agony, clearly in a severe state of shock. battered, yet somehow incredibly still alive. but just barely.}
