<D>__{a dream? of course i have a dream i just don't know what the hell it is.}
<P>__{(shrugs and smiles)}
<A>__{ed's image freezes, while he has a funny cute expression on his face. pull back to reveal a tv in a conference room with ed's frozen image on it. cynthia is there with her bosses, the people who run the network that owns real tv. the top man is mr. scharlach. his deputies are ms. seaver and mr. mcilvaine. this is not the same place where we met cynthia and her staff. this is richer, more corporate and formal.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{he's who we want to go with.}
<C>__{scharlach}
<P>__{(doubtfully)}
<D>__{this guy.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i polled my staff. the men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. and one of the men said he's fuckable.}
<C>__{scharlach}
<D>__{i'm not sure about the entire concept.}
<A>__{cynthia is frustrated.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{look it's not like we're burning up the airwaves now. we're running neck and neck with the gardening channel. if people just tune in to this twice a day for five minutes, we're a hit. plus we can sell advertising every second, running at the bottom of the screen... and the beauty is this guy doesn't even have to be good. i mean if he's good, great. but if he winds up making an ass of himself, better. mcilvaine how is that better?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{come on. people cannot turn away from an accident. you drive by, you say "ooh, i hope there's not a head lying in the road" but you look ! see, nobody in america wants to be nobody. this guy wants to be famous. so, basically, the deal is he agrees to drive down the highway a hundred miles an hour blindfolded and we get to see if his head winds up rolling down the highway. fun for the whole family. so let's do it.}
<A>__{she stops, waiting for approval.}
