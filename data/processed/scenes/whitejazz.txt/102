<L>__{exterior fern dell park evening}
<A>__{rolling green. half dirt, half asphalt path. i scan for any back up. nothing. junior already there. astride like gary cooper. his eyes bloodshot from here. my gun riding quick draw style. the heft feels good. unbutton my coat to show him the file as i approach, tucked right behind my .45.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{where's the knife.}
<A>__{junior, this evil little curl. he turns. follow him over a small knoll: that gray packard, waiting. a silhouette behind the wheel. as we near it the lights come on, blind me.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{turn your lights off...and just come out and talk to me...fritz.}
<A>__{a pause in the car, junior looks at me like i'm rasputin, divining answers from the marine layer moving in over la. the lights pop off and i hear a tired laugh coming from the car that we've all heard before.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{third party confirmed...i fucking knew it.}
<A>__{fritz koenig steps out of the packard.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{not much with these sub rosa things...}
<C>__{me}
<P>__{(a nod to the packard)}
<D>__{i thought it was noonan tailing me.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{bradley's greatest stroke was enlisting you to his side.}
<A>__{junior, jumpy in my periphery. i don't like it.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{wilhite ran magdalena for you, not narco.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{when did you know?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{i didn't. i had a feeling. i smelled cover up all over hector's disappearance and wilhite wouldn't have the muscle or the mind set to kingpin something that big by himself...you knew about bradley trying to buy him out?}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{he was offering to exonerate hector and clear his criminal record. hector met with wilhite and i to inform us of his decision...}
