<L>__{interior chamberlan's toy dept. night}
<A>__{we are looking at a big, fuzzy, smiling, pink stuffed elephant. willie's hand hesitates between this elephant and the one behind, which is purple. we hear him muttering:}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{shit... which did he say?}
<A>__{the hand finally leaves with the purple elephant. we hold for a long beat. the hand reenters to put back the purple and take the pink. willie turns around holding the stuffed elephant. marcus and lois are standing there presenting a grotesque picture: lois has a shopping cart filled with shoes, scarves, jewels, a salad spinner, purses, a block of ginsu knives, an abdomen exerciser. she wears a pair of sunglasses from which a price tag dangles, and a long ermine stole. next to her marcus holds the santa bag bulging with indeed, sprouting cash.}

<D>__{well, i don't think that store dick is gonna want this.}

<C>__{willie}
<D>__{dead, huh...}
<A>__{again, he licks his lips.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{...i didn't even know he was sick.}

<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you gotta be able to rely, willie.}

<D>__{fuck me...}
<A>__{he ducks, clutching the elephant to his chest, and scurries behind a counter.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{...fuck me fuck me fuck me...}
<A>__{gunfire fills the air. exploding merchandise chases along the counter behind willie as the cops seek to put him down. under the gunfire we hear marcus's maniacal laughter. willie reaches the end of the counter. a brief open space separates him from a stairwell; he dashes across as gunfire redoubles and plunges down the stairs.}
<L>__{exterior chamberlain's loading dock night}
<A>__{willie bursts out onto the loading dock still holding the elephant. he dives into his mercedes and peels out.}
<L>__{exterior saguaro square mall parking lot night}
<A>__{rounding the corner of the loading dock, willie comes upon a fleet of squad cars idling in the street. cops yell, draw their guns and fire as willie clips a couple cars, skids and slues, and finally is clear of the pack. he roars up the road as policemen leap for their vehicles, crank up their sirens and pursue.}
<L>__{interior mercedes moving night}
<A>__{willie drives, his jaw set, a desperate man in a santa suit. he glances up at the rearview which shows many flashing light bars.}

<L>__{exterior the kid's house neighborhood night}
<A>__{willie's car corners onto sage terrace on two wheels, slams back down onto four, fishtails up to the kid's house and squeals braking into its driveway. the police vehicles, in hot pursuit, squeal, skid, and slew around in a jumble at the foot of the lawn. cops leap out of their cars just as willie jumps from his.}
<C>__{megaphone voice}
<D>__{halt, put your hands up!}
<A>__{willie is sprinting up the walk toward the front door. his voice echoes lone and weak after the boom of the megaphone:}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{up your ass!}
<A>__{he bounds up the stoop.}
<C>__{police voice}
<D>__{all right, boys nail him!}
<A>__{a ripple of gunfire. at the top of the stoop, facing the door, willie staggers, rolls his eyes, and drops.}

<A>__{drawn by the noise, an adorable six year old in a nearby house slides open his second story bedroom window to look.}
<T>__{his high pov:}
<A>__{frozen in a semi circle at the foot of the neighboring lawn, an army of cops has guns trained on the felled santa claus, who is sprawled on the neighbor's stoop, motionless. his hand stretches toward the front door holding a fluffy pink elephant un delivered... the six year old draws in his breath and screams. he is joined by his equally adorable little brother and sister who look, and scream, with him. somewhere, a neighborhood dog barks. a cop looks up at the window and the three shrieking children.}

<L>__{interior the kid's house day}
<A>__{after a long beat, willie's voice:}
<C>__{willie }
<D>__{dear kid. i hope that you got my present and that there wasn't too much blood on it, although there was blood on the present you gave me which didn't keep me from enjoying it, so maybe the blood doesn't matter so much i guess.}
<A>__{we are fading in on a shelf in the kid's bedroom where the stuffed elephant sits, in a place of honor, its fur indeed stiff and stained with dried blood. the kid's bedroom is no longer in disarray, things are neat and comfy. we pan off of it to find this letter, crudely handwritten, tacked up on a little bulletin board.}
<C>__{willie }
<D>__{...anyway, just in case they took it as evidence i am also sending you a t shirt. i hope it's the right size. i am healing up good and they tell me that i will soon be one hundred percent even with eight bullets dug out of me because they didn't hit any vital organs, just my liver which is fucked anyway, ha ha ha. anyways...}
<A>__{our continuing pan brings us to the open door of the bedroom and we hear the sound of the tv in the living room. we track toward it.}
<C>__{willie }
<D>__{...thank you for giving that letter to the cops. i forgot i asked you to do it but it's a good thing you did or santa's little helper would've plugged his ass. and now the cops know i wrote it, which is gonna keep my ass out of jail. that, plus everyone agreeing that the phoenix police department shooting an unarmed santa was even more fucked up than rodney king. the cops are treating me like fucking royalty now which is new in my experience. they are gonna make me a sensitivity counselor so that tragedies like this will never again embarrass the whole fucking department. whatever.}
<A>__{grandma is in the living room watching tv. we track past her towards the jacuzzi area.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{...as for my little helper, i am sorry to have to tell you that him and his prune faced mail order wife are gonna be exploring mountains with your dad. i hope your dad doesn't go sucking shit from them like i did. meanwhile, i told the cops you had no one to take the fuck care of you, so they set it up with mrs. santa's sister watching you till your dad gets back in one year and three months. they made her a guardian pro temp or some such shit... anyway, she makes better money than bartending and seems to like you and your house and jacuzzi.}
<A>__{sue is in a towel, holding a highball as she climbs out of the jacuzzi. the kid walks by her carrying a bucket. she tousles his hair affectionately as he goes by. he's never looked better. we track towards the foyer. it's empty but the front door is open. we track towards it. we go out the front door...}
<C>__{willie }
<D>__{...so i will be staying in phoenix now, telling the police how screwed up they are which is not a bad job as jobs go. they're supposed to let me out of this hospital room soon so i will see you when i come over to fuck mrs. santa's sister in the jacuzzi. until then, don't take no shit from nobody. least of all yourself. anyways... see ya soon...}
<A>__{the kid is dipping a toilet bowl brush into a bucket of soapy water on the front stoop.}
<C>__{willie }
<D>__{...santa.}
<A>__{as the kid turns and hunkers down to scrub the dried blood off the stoop, we see the back of his t shirt. shit happens}
