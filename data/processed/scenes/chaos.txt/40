<A>__{black clad #1 and #4 remove from their bag ropes, pulleys, an iron spike and hammer. #1 also removes... a spear gun. #1 connects the rope to a spear. fires the spear into the wall above the bank's front windows! he snags a 2nd spear, repeats. police tech van the detectives huddle. impatience level high.}
<C>__{conners}
<P>__{(to dax)}
<D>__{try again.}
<C>__{dax}
<D>__{he's not picking up.}
<C>__{conners}
<P>__{(stern)}
<D>__{try again.}
<A>__{dax, humbled, does as ordered.}
<C>__{conners}
<P>__{(glances about)}
<D>__{where's our fearless captain?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{went uptown to brief the commissioner.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{so you're here in his place.}
<A>__{conners fumbles with the wrapper, but eventually sticks another piece of gum in his mouth. teddy notices.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{nicotine gum.}
<C>__{teddy}
<P>__{(shock)}
<D>__{you quit smoking?}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{caffeine, too, if you must know.}
<P>__{(another shock)}
<D>__{what? a man's capable of change.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{a man, yes. you... i'm not so sure.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{don't worry, i still have a vice or two.}
<C>__{dax}
<D>__{fifteen rings. no answer.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{try again in five.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{what are they doing in there?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{wasting our time.}
<A>__{time. the word rings in conners's head. he starts to put it together.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{precisely. he knows police protocol, not to mention the shit in our own precinct. he's disguising his voice, means he's got a record and has done this before. he's heavily armed and well connected. he knows he's surrounded. he hasn't asked for a damned thing. he drops that hint about sunrise, prepping us for a long wait. he's buying time. why?}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(brainstorming)}
<D>__{to figure out his next move. he wasn't expecting us.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{no, he wasn't expecting you. he said, he thought you were still suspended.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{probably thought it would take the whole day for you to find me. giving him the time he needs.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{he's stalling.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{he almost has what he came for.}
<A>__{conners nods, eyes dekker as if for the first time.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{or... he's got what he came for and he's waiting for his ticket out of here.}
<P>__{(the decision)}
<D>__{we're going in.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{the bank has three points of entry. teddy and vincent, take a swat team, head to the west side. we'll have the swat commander take the east. dekker, you're with me. where is the swat commander?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i will find him.}
<A>__{vincent leaves conners with dekker and teddy.}
<C>__{teddy}
<P>__{(to conners; concern)}
<D>__{that's a big call, quentin. thought about what you're doing?}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{you questioning me, teddy?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{unfortunately... yeah.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{i question how you can fuck that asshole and still manage to look in the mirror.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{i'm not going to get into this now. and you're one to talk. i hear...}
<C>__{conners}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{the hostages are in imminent danger. they've confessed to killing someone, an automatic murder one charge that's a life sentence, maybe a needle for all of them. so why keep witnesses around to testify? longer we wait, the greater the risk. we need to go in. now.}
<C>__{teddy}
<P>__{(beat; then relents)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{even dekker seems to agree with that theory. vincent arrives with the swat commander, 40's, a former navy seal with a "don't fuck with me" attitude.}
<C>__{swat commander}
<D>__{i got snipers up top and ten soldiers on the ground.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{what's the best way in?}
<C>__{swat commander}
<D>__{tear gas, blow the doors...}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{hold on. no explosives. i got forty civilians in there, too great a chance. any other way?}
<C>__{swat commander}
<D>__{there's no pussy way in. the doors are locked electronically from the inside. we ain't getting in without force.}
<C>__{conners}
<P>__{(beat; thinks)}
<D>__{what if we cut the power? that will disable the system and we can open the locks manually, come in that way?}
<C>__{swat commander}
<P>__{(thinks; concedes)}
<D>__{that'll work.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{so we'll take the pussy way, commander. we cut the power and go in at 11:15 sharp!}
