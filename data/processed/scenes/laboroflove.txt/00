<A>__{a three lane highway relegated to one lane. the serpentine line of cars bottlenecks as it slithers by. an arch of orange and red flares outlines the area of shattered glass and twisted metal. we are at the site of a gruesome car accident. an ambulance and four police cars are on the scene. two cars are involved in the crash. the first, a silver cadillac with its front caved in a perfect semi circle; there is no one inside the car. the second car is a different story entirely. a dark green honda prelude crushed against the concrete median that separates the south bound lanes from the north bound lanes. all the windows have imploded. the original seventeen foot length of the car, compressed to ten. the hood has folded back into the front seat. this car is not empty! through the sliver that used to be a window, we see a female hand, purple, swollen and bloody. some drivers have stopped their cars on the shoulder and have walked over to the flares. a set of cops wave them back.}
