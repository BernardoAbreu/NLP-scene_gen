<A>__{josh wanders out of the kitchen, examining the house as if seeing it for the first time. he is smiling...happier than we have ever seen him. elise sits on the couch amongst the remains of tucker's paraphernalia of the paranormal. josh approaches her, standing over her.}

<D>__{what's the matter, elise?}
<A>__{she spins around and lifts tucker's camera up to her face, aiming it at him. she depresses the trigger and takes a photo of him, bathing the whole corridor in white light. josh recoils back in shock. elise lowers the camera. she is terrified. josh suddenly lunges at her, slapping the camera out of her hands.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{why the fuck would you do that? why would you do that? why?!}
<A>__{he slams her against the wall, his hands around her throat. elise chokes in terror, terrified of him.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{you of all people! you know! why would you do that to me when you know what you know? you bitch!}
<A>__{he abruptly stops attacking her, staggering backwards, examining his hands as if he can't believe what he's done. seething with fury. panting. elise collapses, catching her breath. josh swipes a framed photo off the wall and storms away, heading down the corridor... ...swallowed up by the darkness.}
