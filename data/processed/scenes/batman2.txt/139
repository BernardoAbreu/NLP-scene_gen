<D>__{tie the cord to the handle of your box.}
<A>__{provost lets the phone drop. he grits his teeth, but hastens to obey. as he's knotting the cord around the handle of the box, a dinky bird flutters down through the trap and sends him into a panic. practically weeping, he reaches for the phone.}

<D>__{when you're done, i want you to give two sharp yanks on the cord.}
<A>__{cowering in terror, provost reaches for the cord and yanks it twice.}
<C>__{provost}
