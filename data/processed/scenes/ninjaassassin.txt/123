<L>__{interior orphanage kitchen dining dormitory dojo night}
<A>__{the fires are ripping through the interior, leaping from bamboo furniture to paper shoji screens to polished wooden floors as raizo kicks down the burning wall of the empty dorm, the futons smoldering. raizo continues into the next hall to find takeshi waiting for him. an apparition in the wavering blaze of heat, silhouetted against a wall of fire.}
<C>__{takeshi}
<D>__{come, little brother, let us play like old times}
<A>__{they spring at other. meeting in the middle of the hallway as the flames dance around them...recalling the lanterns they used to fight through, in the days of their training. their weapons ring out a frenzied drum roll of steel on steel. neither giving an inch. evenly matched in skill and ferocity. locking together for a moment takeshi smiles.}
<C>__{takeshi }
<D>__{no death tasted as sweet as hers.}
<A>__{raizo's back glistens orange in the firelight, sweat pouring as he strains, attacks, defends and attacks again. takeshi jumps over them, twists mid air and ducks low beneath raizo's swinging chain as raizo stumbles back on the polished floor, blocking takeshi's attack, but takeshi catches his wrist in an iron grip. as he brings his sword around, raizo gets a loop of chain around the blade and locks it tight. both men spin in their sudden embrace. faces inches from each other.}
<C>__{takeshi }
<D>__{i watched you die when i pierced her heart. you have always been too weak to be ozunu.}
<A>__{takeshi's finger trips a hidden button on the sword. the blade retracts back through the handle and a yard of steel jolts out from the hilt of takeshi's sword. he moves to slam it into raizo's side...but raizo flips over him, holding onto the hilt and as he lands he drives the steel into takeshi's heart. he still stands for a beat, more by inertia than will, then slumps, dead, to the floor. raizo stalks down the hall. one last task ahead of him.}
