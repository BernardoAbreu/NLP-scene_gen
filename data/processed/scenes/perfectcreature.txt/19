<L>__{int: jamestown slum, tenement office continuing}
<A>__{jones has the slum landlord by the throat.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{you're a fucking liar!}
<C>__{slum landlord}
<D>__{no, no, i swear it, i gave 'em their boosters, both of 'em. i'm a responsible landlord, i swear to god. there must've been something wrong with them vaccines.}
<A>__{lilly stares at the slum landlord; shock in her face, and anger.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{this is a civil health violation! you're going to the hell house for this. you can forget lovely doris here where you're going.}
<A>__{we see the woman who was screaming before, the prostitute; she makes an obscene gesture at jones. as this is going on frank and the other man we've seen are tearing the place apart, looking for something. they don't find it and frank's look tells lilly so. lilly's face is a mask. she is watching the slum landlord very carefully. he keeps looking down; strangely, nervously.}
<C>__{slum landlord}
<D>__{i don't know what you're on about. i've done nothing, i swear to god, i've done nothing.}
<A>__{lilly lets her eyes drift down, all the way down to the chair legs, which rock unevenly on the floor. lilly is staring at the scratched, worn floor boards which move. cut to frank, prizing back the floor boards. jones restrains the slum landlord. lilly watches. frank pulls the floor boards away easily. we see that hidden in the floor cavity are packets of something. frank pulls them out. rips one of the plastic bags open. in it are packets with the words "jamestown borough civilian influenza vaccination." frank holds it up for lilly to see. the slum landlord is now looking three ways at once. lilly slowly begins to approach the slum landlord.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{it is my pleasure to inform you that you are under arrest for trafficking influenza vaccine.}
<C>__{slum landlord}
<D>__{i want my lawyer.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{this is a violation of the 12 10 health act, whereby you have withheld borough sponsored vaccines from your tenants.}
<C>__{slum landlord}
<D>__{i want a lawyer!}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{anything you say will be held against you as evidence and, by endangering the public good, you are not entitled to a lawyer.}
<A>__{the slum landlord just stares at her.}
<C>__{slum landlord}
<D>__{fuck you then.}
<A>__{lilly smiles grimly.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{there's only one other thing.}
<A>__{lilly gives the slum landlord one almighty slap across the face that stuns him. then jones grabs the slum landlord and drags him off, but we stay on lilly. her face. she stoops and lifts something from the landlords desk. a public health flier saying "fight influenza. ask your landlord for your free vaccine now." then from the corner of the room, the prostitute pipes up, impatiently waving a cigarette at lilly.}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{oi! how about me? he promised me some of that. i earned it.}
<A>__{cut to}
