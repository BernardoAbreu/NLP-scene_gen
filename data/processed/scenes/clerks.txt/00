<A>__{a dog sleeps on a neatly made bed. a clock reads twenty to six. a shelf of books holds such classics as dante's inferno, beyond good and evil, the catcher in the rye, and the dark knight returns. a framed diploma, dusty and unkempt, hangs askew on the wall. a snapshot of a girl is stuck in the corner, and a bra weighs one end down. a phone sits quietly atop a bundle of laundry. it suddenly explodes with a resounding ring once, twice, three times. a closet door swings open, and a half clad figure falls out. the phone rings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking it off the trash can, o.c. the rumpled figure lays with his back to the camera, phone in hand.}

<D>__{swear you'll be in by twelve and i will do it....twelve...twelve or i walk.}
<A>__{the phone receiver slams into the cradle. the rumpled figure slowly sits up and remains motionless. he musses his hair and stands. the dog stands and wags its tail. a hand pats its head. the rumpled figure lays down on the bed. we now see his face. it is the face of dante and this is dante's room; this is dante's life. dante grabs the dog and wrestles it.}
