<L>__{interior walter's apt. night}
<A>__{walter sits at his table, a scrap of wood in his hand. he whittles away at the wood. it is the rough outline of a heart with wings. there is a loud knock on the door. walter gets up. the knock comes again, even harder. walter goes to the door and opens it. the smiles fades from his face. sergeant lucas pushes the door open further and walks right in. he wears a well tailored suit.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{hiya, walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{cop.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{sergeant lucas.}
<P>__{(flashes his badge)}
<D>__{may i come in?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you are in.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{so i am. but i always like to ask.}
<A>__{walter closes the door behind him. lucas walks around the apartment. walter watches him, uneasy.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{what's up?}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{have a seat.}
<A>__{walter hesitates, then obeys.}
<C>__{lucas }
<D>__{you don't know?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{i think you do.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{why don't you just tell me?}
<A>__{lucas walks over to the window.}
<C>__{walter }
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i haven't broken any laws.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{then you won't mind if i look around.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i would.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{got something to hide?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{doesn't everybody?}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{i could get a search warrant.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{if you could, you would have brought one today.}
<A>__{lucas looks at walter. he looks at the table.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{cherry?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{unusual design for a contemporary piece.}
<A>__{lucas runs his hand along the surface.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{it's not for sale.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{who said i wanted to buy it?}
<A>__{lucas walks back to the window.}
<C>__{lucas }
<D>__{two nights ago, a ten year old girl was attacked not too far from here.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{seems there's been a number of attacks on young girls in the vicinity. kind of a coincidence, wouldn't you say?}
<A>__{walter stands up.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{if you tell me when this happened }
<A>__{walter places his hands in his pockets. lucas whirls around.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{move your fucking hands away from your pockets!}
<A>__{walter does.}
<C>__{lucas }
<D>__{sit down!}
<A>__{walter sits.}
<C>__{lucas }
<D>__{we know every step you make, every goddamn step! we know when you sleep, when you eat, when you shit, and when you jack off.}
<A>__{lucas leans over the table, nose to nose with walter.}
<C>__{lucas }
<D>__{and when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? is that when you jerk off?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you can't talk to me like }
<C>__{lucas}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{like a piece of shit? in my eyes, you are a piece of shit. think anyone would miss you if i threw you out the window right now?}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{i could say you jumped when i came in. who are they going to believe? not you, because you'd be a dead piece of shit.}
<A>__{beat. lucas taps walter onl the forehead and smiles.}
<C>__{lucas }
<P>__{(feigning kindness)}
<D>__{we just want to make sure you're being a good boy, walter. okay?}
<A>__{walter is silent. lucas taps him again.}
<C>__{lucas }
<D>__{okay?}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{lucas rises, spits his gum in the sink, and leaves. walter leans over squeezing his head tight between his hands. the sound of children fades in and walter looks up. the girl with the red ball stands across from him in the doorway to his bedroom. she smiles and bounces the ball. walter folds over, cradling his head in his arms.}
