<A>__{chuck takes a swallow of water, washes it around in his mouth, then swallows. with his wet tongue he licks his cracked lips. the sun breaks through the clouds. with what strength he has left, chuck raises the canopy, fastens it. he sits in the meager shade, his head between his knees. closes his eyes. just for a minute.}
<L>__{exterior ocean day later}
<A>__{a different sort of shadow crosses chuck's face. he opens his eyes. there, riding right beside his raft, is a ship, a huge rusty tanker. someone shouts down in a language we don't understand. chuck sits up, can't believe it. struggles to cover himself.}
