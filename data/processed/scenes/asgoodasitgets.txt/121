<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(gently; almost lovingly)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, melvin but whatever this is is not going to work.}
<B>__{on melvin}
<A>__{he takes this hard. it forces him to half whisper something he hasn't at all said to himself... given his history... this is an extraordinary intimacy.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i'm feeling... i've been feeling better.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{melvin, even though it may seem that way now you don't know me all that well...}

<D>__{... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...}
