<L>__{interior hannah's room }
<A>__{hannah, wrapped loosely in cotton sheets, smiles as she listens to the goatee kid, who sits cross legged at the foot of her bed, fully clothed.}
<C>__{goatee kid}
<D>__{i'm telling you, the tango is ail about latent homosexual love. look at the way they dance it's sodomy.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{stop it.}
<A>__{hannah looks up, sees grady in the doorway and blushes. she pulls the sheet up, gives an oddly formal wave.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{grady. hi. what's up?}
<A>__{jeff eases off the bed, past grady uneasily.}
<C>__{goatee kid}
<D>__{i will be ...somewhere else.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{hey, jeff. if you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.}
<A>__{jeff nods puzzled then goes. grady smirks.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{he cribbed that from borges.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{it beats 'what's your major?'}
<A>__{grady nods, detecting a new aloofness in her voice.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{right. anyway, i was wondering if i could borrow your car. mine's sort of out of commission.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{sure. the keys are on the dresser next to. ..to your book.}
<A>__{the hitch in hannah's voice hangs in the room like a cloud.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{i uh, i didn't finish, i ...fell asleep.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{that good, hub?}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{no, it's not that, it's...}
<A>__{hannah glances at the huge stack of paper sitting on her dresser, then, hesitantly, looks back to grady.}
<C>__{hannah green}
<D>__{it's just that, you know, i was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us ' that writers make choices at least the good ones. and, don't get me wrong. i'm not saying the book isn't really great i mean, really great but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and ail the dental records and so on and i don't know, maybe i'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...}
<P>__{(with trepidation)}
<A>__{...you didn't make any choices at all. and i was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always ...under the influence.}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(stung)}
<D>__{hh huh. well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, i'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. and furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book i wrote, as you say, 'under the influence, ' happened to win a little something called the pen award which, by the way, i accepted 'under the influence. '}
<A>__{hannah nods, averts her eyes, and immediately grady feels ridiculous. he starts to say something, but instead gathers his manuscript and exits.}
