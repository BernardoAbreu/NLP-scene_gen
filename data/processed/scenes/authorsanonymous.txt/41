<L>__{interior restaurant #1 day}
<A>__{the two middle aged women (customer #1 and customer #2) sit across from each other in the nearly deserted restaurant. body language suggests an intense, passionate, personal chat.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{a writer has to hear everything. on the streets. in the restaurants.}
<A>__{but something's amiss. customer #1 stops abruptly, glancing at the table next to them: william has suddenly materialized. sitting with a cup of coffee and a legal pad, scribbling.}
<D>__{william (v.o.) (cont'd) my dialogue has to be real so i'm everywhere. standing behind you at the checkout stand.}
<A>__{customer #1 resumes conversation, but looks sharply back at william. his head is tilted towards them. listening.}
<D>__{william (v.o.) (cont'd) peeing next to you at the urinal. i watch. i listen.}
<A>__{customer #1 says something to customer #2. looks back at william. his head is still cocked as he makes notes.}
<D>__{william (v.o.) (cont'd) writing down scraps of conversation.}
<A>__{customer #1 grows more agitated. customer #2 tries to calm her down. finally, customer #1 shoots up and marches over to william, her finger jabbing in the air towards the notebook. william shrugs, playing dumb.}
<D>__{william (v.o.) (cont'd) that's right. i eavesdrop.}
<A>__{customer #1 reaches down and grabs the notebook from william. he tries to stop her, but too late.}
<D>__{william (v.o.) (cont'd) how else do you accurately capture the misery of the human condition?}
<A>__{she reads the page and shows it to cutomer #2 who reads the notes and is equally shocked.}
<D>__{william (v.o.) (cont'd) now bukowski says "an intellectual says a simple thing in a hard way."}
<A>__{the two women start yelling at william. he keeps shaking his head. customer #1 tears the page into shreds.}
<D>__{william (v.o.) (cont'd) "an artist says a hard thing in a simple way."}
<A>__{waitress #2 comes over. the women talk to her and she starts yelling at william. customer #1 poking her finger in his chest. escalates to a push. the cook comes out and starts yelling at william.}
<D>__{william (v.o.) (cont'd) gotta love it. that's me. simple. real.}
<A>__{surrounded by yelling people, william breaks through the circle and moves towards the door. the bus boy yells, too.}
<D>__{william (v.o.) (cont'd) powerful. an artist.}
