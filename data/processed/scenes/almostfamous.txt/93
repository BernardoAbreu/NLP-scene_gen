<P>__{(angry, louder)}
<D>__{i miss you and i love you!}
<A>__{william now notices penny standing nearby, picking at a salad from a paper dish. looking at her, he lets loose with what he believes is a private confession.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i love you!!}
<A>__{penny smiles knowingly, collecting his affection like another backstage pass, and turns away. camera stays on william. he is suddenly and deeply embarrassed. he's just told her that he loves her and she knows it. he hangs up, traumatized.}
