<L>__{interior mmcr. day}
<A>__{on a large center display screen, we see luke and the mars one crew, sitting around their kitchen table in the hab, finishing lunch while taping this video message.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{we're all trying not to go too nuts up here, but we think there's a good chance this could be an extrusion from some subsurface, geothermal column of water. and if we're right...}
<A>__{he looks at his crew. they beam like cats who ate canaries.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{...then we've found the key to permanent human colonization.}
<B>__{in the mmcr}
<A>__{there's an excited buzz among the assembled technicians, flight engineers, and scientists. this would be a fantastic, epochal discovery.}
<B>__{mcconnell}
<A>__{sits at the center console, wearing a headset. he's now the mars one capcom (capsule communicator), and his manner is brisk, efficient, all business. a technician leans in for instructions.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{tell geology and hydrology we need to scramble on this. full court press.}
<A>__{the technician nods, hurries away. mcconnell, sharing the intense excitement of those around him, stares up at}
<B>__{the screen}
<A>__{where luke and his crew are still smiling, well knowing the excitement their bombshell will create.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{anyway, we'are going out to take a closer look at it, try to get an idea of its composition.}
<P>__{(checks his watch)}
<D>__{by the time you receive this, we should be just about on site.}
