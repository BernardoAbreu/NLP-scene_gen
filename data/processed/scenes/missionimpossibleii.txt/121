<A>__{ethan and ambrose round a bend and face one another. without hesitating, they charge towards each other. as they near one another, each leaps forward and off his bike, and they collide hard in mid air. they fall to the ground fighting as their bikes skid and ethan's explodes, raining debris upon them. ethan and ambrose rush towards one another. ethan flips ambrose to the ground. ambrose pulls a gun from his ankle holster. as ethan knocks it away, he loses his own gun and they both fall off a 30 foot cliff.}
