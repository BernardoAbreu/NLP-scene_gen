<A>__{john sits back down. he steals side glances at her. her mouth. her red painted fingers knitting fast. john flips through the channels the money programme. antique's roadshow. cup rugby. eventually he offers nadia the remote control. she takes, aims it at the t.v. but doesn't press it. just as it seems she won't, she does: university challenge. they watch university challenge with nadia still aiming the control and smoking. after another long pause she flips the button the money programme. antiques roadshow. rugby. she flips again then hands the controls back to john and they watch university challenge. nadia puts down her knitting, stretches and yawns.}
