<L>__{exterior backyard evening}
<A>__{the pigeons take to the air like an explosion. the chickens start to cackle and run about as harry reaches for one with his cane. the sound of the boy next door practicing with his trumpet adds to the bedlam. suzie is standing on the steps, shouting to harry. the noise of the panicked chickens and the boy playing the trumpet next door drown out suzie's voice. not getting harry's attention, she hurries down the steps. harry has caught a hen that is screaming her head off. he looks around and finds suzie hurrying towards him.}
