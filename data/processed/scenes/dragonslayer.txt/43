<B>__{lake of fire}
<A>__{the earthquakes have subsided; the water is calm. galen stares bleakly into the flames. as he watches, they gather themselves into a lazy spiral. gradually the spiral speeds up and becomes a vortex. now the flames become tinged with green, and as the cavern moans with the sound of rushing air, a form takes shape at the crest of a jet of flame. it is ulrich, supine as upon his pyre, reforming before galen's eyes.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{ulrich! magister! over here! i can see you! over here!}
<C>__{ulrich}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{not so loud. i'm not deaf, you know.}

<D>__{no? oh well, no time anyway.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{valerian is standing in the unearthly twilight, anxiously peering into the mouth of the lair. suddenly she is hit from behind by a gust of wind. she does not turn to see the enormous vermithrax alighting silently behind her. galen & ulrich ulrich raises galen to his feet.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{come along. there's much to be done.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{wait, i have something to tell you.}

<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{well said. now hurry.}
<A>__{he leads the way across the rocks to the shore and into the tunnel.}
<B>__{valerian}
<A>__{time seems to have come to a stop. overhead, the moon is locked in front of the sun. at the lair, valerian stands frozen as the dragon leans over her. the great head sways from side to side. the jaws hinge open. suddenly, valerian recovers herself and makes a run for it, leaping and scrabbling over the rocks. a plume of flame licks at her heels. she sees a protective crevice and heads for it, but a winged claw drops to block her way. she changes direction and is cut off again. cat and mouse.}
<B>__{vermithrax}
<A>__{the pale yellow eyes stare implacably down at the hopeless victim. the igniter jets come on, then off, as the beast suddenly stiffens. the head rotates, almost as if catching a new scent. finally the eyes focus on the entrance to the cavern.}
<B>__{ulrich}
<A>__{there is the sorcerer, leaning on galen, coolly regarding the creature. the old man's expression hardens.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{draco draconis...}
<A>__{the dragon lifts its wings as if to menace them, then flaps twice and is airborne. the thing shoots overhead and, with a rush of wind, flies off into the gloom.}
<B>__{in the rocks}
<A>__{valerian struggles out of her hiding place.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{galen!}
<A>__{galen runs to her. they embrace. when they look up, ulrich is at their side.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{where's my amulet? give it to me, please.}
<A>__{galen's hand locates the jewel under his shirt. he finds himself reluctant to part with it. with a hurricane howl, a column of flame touches down nearby and rushes toward them. they stagger back as the dragon sweeps past.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{be quick!}
<A>__{galen hands his treasure over. ulrich closes his hand around it.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{come close to me.}
<A>__{galen and valerian approach. the old man's hand is suffused with an internal glow. behind them, the dragon is turning for another pass.}
<B>__{vortex}
<A>__{all at once the glow brightens, and in another instant the world spins off into a blur, setting all three afloat in a timeless netherworld. valerian and galen cling to each other in terror.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{don't be afraid. you have served me with great courage. now you must show me you have even more.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{anything!}
<A>__{the voices seem to be coming from a huge distance. starlike gleams whiz by, and fleeting glimpses of half recognizable faces and forms. the wizard's eyes are like glittering crystals. tiny motes and planetoids dance in the hairs of his beard. he seems wreathed in luminescence.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{you must destroy the amulet, and me along with it.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{you brought me from the flames, you must send me back.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{when the time comes, you'll understand. here.}
<A>__{he dangles the amulet in front of galen. even more reluctantly than he let it go, he takes it back.}
<B>__{mountain top}
<A>__{abruptly, the vortex is gone and they find themselves atop a rocky crag overlooking the eclipse darkened fields and farms of urland. galen glances at his surroundings and stares at the amulet, full of awe.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{i know what you're thinking. you have learned much and done well. don't worry, you won't need it any more.}
