<L>__{interior st. thomas aquinas catholic church day}
<A>__{whip in a dark suit walks amidst mourners who file out of the church. the center of attention is a large, distraught woman in her 60's being consoled by what appears to be her son and his wife. the woman wears a pin that holds a photo of trina. whip stands at the bottom of the steps, watching folks, looking for someone. suddenly, a 9 year old boy stands in front of him. the boy locks eyes with him.}
