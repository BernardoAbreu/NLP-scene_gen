<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{more rows of stainless steel doors under hissing steam pipes. the light is dim here, and several bulbs are burned out. but the numbers on the storage rooms are much higher now. the three men come out of the darkness. frock rounds a last corner and wheels to a stop.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{this should be it. can you read the number?}
<A>__{pendergast reaches up above them and taps the light bulb. it comes on and they all see the heavy steel door of the storage area. d'agosta's jaw drops and his toothpick falls out. the door has been scored from top to bottom by long, vicious, claws!}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<A>__{frock stares in amazement, shaken. he runs a finger down the deep ruts.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{something tried to get into this room!}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{and failed. these doors are solid steel.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{this means there must be an animal loose in the museum!}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{i wouldn't be so sure.}
<A>__{pendergast takes frock's keys and opens the door. it swings wide on oiled hinges. d'agosta turns on a light.}
