<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior sideline day}
<A>__{shane is sitting on the bench holding his head and his side. he's talking quietly to mcginty.}
<B>__{on wilkinson}
<A>__{he's on the field calling for a fair catch. he makes it.}
<C>__{al }
<D>__{... one minute twenty remaining, and even though dallas didn't score, they sure ate up a lot of the clock.}
<A>__{another angle wilkinson he's leading the offense out onto the field.}
<C>__{boomer }
<D>__{and it looks like falco cannot answer the bell. he's still on the bench and it appears that safety earl wilkinson will be leading the redskin offense.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{they just need to get the ball in field goal range.}
<C>__{al }
<D>__{and for pacifico, that's anything up to sixty five yards.}
<A>__{another angle wilkinson he takes the snap from the shotgun and keeps the ball on a sweep. he plows for twelve yards.}
<C>__{al }
<D>__{that's good for twelve yards. the clock stops on the first down. the redskins have no time outs left.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{mcginty is still bent over him.}
<D>__{mcginty i need your hands in there for the field goal. i can't trust franklin to hold. he almost dropped the extra pointerior}
<A>__{shane is in major pain but nods his head.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i can do it.}
<B>__{on wilkinson}
<A>__{he rolls again, but no one is open. he crosses the line of scrimmage, is hit and goes down.}
<B>__{on clock}
<A>__{it continues to run and passes twenty seconds as we watch.}
<B>__{on redskins}
<A>__{they're hurrying back to the line of scrimmage. wilkinson stands over center. on the snap, wilkinson throws the ball out of bounds.}
<C>__{al }
<D>__{wilkinson throws it away, and with twelve seconds remaining, the redskins will try a forty eight yard field goal to tie it up. that's almost a chip shot for pacifico.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{he shakily follows pacifico out onto the field. reese evans catches up with him.}
<C>__{evans}
<P>__{(to shane)}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{just make it a good snap.}
<P>__{(to pacifico)}
<D>__{and you'll do the rest, right?}
<A>__{pacifico doesn't answer.}
<B>__{on ball}
<A>__{evans leans over it.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{he's kneeling in the middle of the field waiting for the snap. but something is bothering him.}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(to pacifico)}
<D>__{lou, are you alright?}
<A>__{pacifico looks up from where he is set up for the kick. there are tears in his eyes.}
<C>__{pacifico}
<D>__{i'm sorry. they know where my family lives.}
<A>__{shane tries to digest what he just heard.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{evans}
<P>__{(through his legs)}
<D>__{come on, shane!}
<A>__{shane looks back at pacifico and makes a decision.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{hut!}
<A>__{the ball is snapped perfectly. shane catches it and spots it perfectly. pacifico moves to kick it. and shane pulls the ball away. pacifico flies through the air like snoopy as he kicks nothing but air. he lands hard. shane jumps to his feet and starts running.}
<C>__{al }
<D>__{it's a fake! falco has it!}
<A>__{on mcginty he's in shock.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{he has totally caught the cowboys by surprise. he sweeps around the right side. the dallas middle linebacker has recovered and is moving quickly to cut shane off. but reese evans comes out of nowhere and crushes the guy with a flying block. shane cuts downfield and heads for the end zone with nobody near him, except: for the same safety from the first half who waits for him at the ten. the safety smiles as he takes a bead on shane. shane heads right for the guy. he puts his head down and smacks helmets with the safety. the guy goes down and shane runs over him and into the end zone.}
<C>__{al }
<D>__{falco scores!}
<A>__{on mcginty he jumps into the air. on o'neil he jumps out of bed. on todd, rod and bob they jump on each other.}
<B>__{on annabelle}
<A>__{she's jumping for joy.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{he spikes the shit out of the ball. and then sees something up field.}
<C>__{al }
<D>__{wait a minute. wait a minute. we've got a flag down.}
<A>__{shane stands stock still in the end zone watching the ref call the penalty.}
<C>__{ref}
<D>__{clipping. number 77 offense.}
<B>__{on mickey lee}
<A>__{he's wearing number 77 and he collapses in tears. on todd, rod and bob they are now sobbing in agony. on o'neil he's being helped back to bed by augustine.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{he's walking slowly back to the line of scrimmage. on mcginty he looks sick. shane walks up to pacifico who is down. his arm is being immobilized by a team trainer.}
<C>__{pacifico}
<D>__{i broke my arm.}
<P>__{(big smile)}
<D>__{thank you. you saved my ass.}
<A>__{shane nods. in his earpiece, he hears mcginty.}
<P>__{mcginty (v.o.)}
<D>__{someday, you can explain what that was all about. we got no kicker, so you gotta take it in. your pick. you're the leader.}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{what would unitas do in this situation?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<A>__{shane leans into the huddle.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i'm so sorry, shane. i'm sorry, everybody.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{no problem, mickey.}
<P>__{(to evans)}
<D>__{hell of a hit, reese.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{that's the one i was looking for. i can retire in peace now.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{right after this play. so besides me, who really wants the ball?}
<A>__{he looks around the huddle. he studies each face. and then he comes to rest on brian murray. brian's eyes are shining. he doesn't need words here.}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(to murray)}
<D>__{yeah. you want it, brian. let's hook up.}
<P>__{(signs as he}
<D>__{says}
<P>__{it)}
<D>__{blue left slot open 'a' right. two jet 'x' drive. on three. gentlemen, it's been an honor sharing the field of battle.}
<A>__{everybody puts their hands into the middle. they break the huddle with a roar.}
<B>__{on clock}
<A>__{three seconds are showing.}
<B>__{on line of scrimmage}
<A>__{shane leans over reese and calls it.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{blue 58! blue 58! hut! hut! hut!}
<A>__{shane nods. on the snap, shane rolls left.}
<B>__{on reese evans}
<A>__{he cuts his man at the knees.}
<B>__{on mickey lee}
<A>__{he takes two men down.}
<B>__{on murray}
<A>__{he cuts on a deep post.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{he steps up and throws a clean bullet downfield. he roars in pain as he throws it.}
<B>__{on murray}
<A>__{the pass is perfect. he pulls it in and beats his man to the end zone. redskins win.}
<B>__{on crowd}
<A>__{it roars! "hail to the redskins" is deafening. todd, rod and bob are screaming. o'neil kisses augustine. annabelle throws a punch into the air. mcginty is all smiles. shane walks up to him and they shake hands. pilachowski and banes hug. lee and andre are hugging and crying. cochran is on his knees praying. reese evans joins him. wilkinson hugs jamal. clifford franklin, hometown boy, throws himself into the stands where fans mob him.}
<B>__{on eddie martel}
<A>__{the washington redskins first string quarterback is so pissed off he jumps up from his seat and turns quickly to go up the steps and out of the stadium. but he slips awkwardly and falls. he grabs his knee and screams.}
<B>__{on brian murray}
<A>__{he's still in the end zone, holding the ball up to the crowd. the roar is deafening. brian's pov we hear nothing, but somehow the pure energy of the moment comes through.}
<B>__{on shane}
<A>__{in the silence, he's walking in slow motion toward annabelle. and everybody is smiling.}
