<L>__{interior cave beneath camelot}
<A>__{they pass through jaws of stalactites and stalagmites. merlin cracks his staff whip like and a ball of fire billows up from the tip and illuminates a cave wildly veined and filigreed with minerals and crusted with growths of crystals. the light goes out but the malachite and the gold, the quartz, diamond and beryllium burn dully. he turns to her, suddenly tall and unstooped, younger, sleek and evil.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{in the folds of the earth where the forces that hold the world together are more alive, my power is strongest. here i will possess you, as a man possesses a woman. and the god, the eunuch, the mule that i was, will be no more.}
<A>__{he sweeps her up into his arms.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{you are truly magnificent!}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{flattery! do you think i am ignorant of your stupid little games? preying on you weakness of others. that's your power, a petty evil. mine is great. great plans. impossible dreams. laughable endings...}
<A>__{he deposits her on bare rock. he kisses her. she pushes him away.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{merlin, the powers of summoning, the true name of the charms of doing and undoing. show me!}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{i won't. you would misuse such power. i have paid enough for you, and i will have you.}
<A>__{she leans forward and kisses his ear and whispers.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{make magic, my foolish wizard. for our love. weave a marvelous room around us, a room worthy of our coupling.}
<A>__{she draws closer, kissing him deeply. he breathes heavily.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{what do you want? you must desire it for me to weave it.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...}
<A>__{morgana falls silent as merlin raises a hand, majestically intoning a harsh repetitive charm. the mineral veins of the cave begin to glow and fog seeps out from them enveloping the couple.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{desire it and it will be as you desire.}
<A>__{morgana burns with intensity. merlin utters a formula and the fog coalesces around them into the shimmering presence of crystal walls, fountains raining jewels, flowers made of scented air, a bed of glass shot with light and covered with skins of animals dead before the time of man, goblets of ruby, tapestries woven of golden hair. she reaches out to touch the wall and her hand plunges through the unmaterialized illusion.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{it's only a semblance. you disappoint me.}
<A>__{she begins lacing up her loosened gown.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{don't touch the walls. come close to me.}
<A>__{she does, a mad hope in her eyes. she kisses his chest.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{do it, merlin, the deepest secret. fix it with the charm of making, for our endless pleasure.}
<A>__{he utters the ancient charm, morgana listening closely, memorizing it. the illusion is all of a sudden solid.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{for you...}
<A>__{she runs her hand across the hard crystal surface, her eyes gleaming. from outside the wondrous room they can be seen to embrace. he carries her to the magical bed where he makes love to her, as they disappear from view in its effulgent light. she comes out through the crystal door, burning with evil intent. she turns to watch him asleep in the bed. she utters the charm of summoning learnt from merlin, and the room melts into an eddying carmine fog. within it, merlin struggles to awaken from the torpor of love, alarmed. outside, morgana utters the charm of making and the gaseous mass begins to crystallize. inside, merlin is rising to his feet, breathing the red fog, his movements slowing to a standstill, his mouth opening in a scream of horror. the cloud has metamorphosed into a magnificent cluster of red crystals. morgana peers into its facets and there she sees, in fragments, merlin's terror... an eye, the gaping mouth, a clawing hand as he is entombed in the stone. she laughs in triumph.}
