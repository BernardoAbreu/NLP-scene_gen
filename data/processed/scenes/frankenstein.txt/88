<A>__{the creature comes blundering into view. on the move. he knows not where. just away, he arrives at a pond. water. he's thirsty. he scrambles to water's edge, starts lapping it up with his hands. he pauses, noticing his broken reflection. the water settles and his face comes clearly into view. he throws his hands up and shrieks, terrified at his own reflection... ...and then he realizes it's him down there. he stirs the water with his fingertips to make sure. he reaches up, touching his face, utterly horrified at the sight of it... ...and utterly heartbroken. he drops his face into his hand and weeps helplessly. barking dogs in the distance. he looks up, thinking they're after him. a moan of grief. he pushes to his feet. tracking the creature faster and faster through the trees, running from this world he's been born into. gasping for breath. crashing through branches. the barking draws closer. he hurls himself into a thicket, scrambling to hide himself, covering himself with dead leaves. panic. exhaustion. mortal terror. he flinches as something comes crashing through the brush nearby. the legs of a doe come into view. staggering. falling. thrashing down into a cushion of dead leaves. two arrows protrude from her heaving side. a tiny fawn stumbles into view on ungainly legs, mouth open, frothing with exhaustion and terror. waiting for his mother to rise. her thrashing grows weaker. dying. the creature moans at the sight. the fawn turns, meets his gaze. an extended beat. a rush of empathy. the creature reaches out. the fawn takes a few hesitant steps toward him. the barking draws closer. hunters shouting. the creature's fingertips make contact with the fawn... a pack of the biggest, nastiest staffordshire terriers you've ever seen throw themselves howling and snarling onto the doe, savaging her like whirling dervishes, the creature lets out a shriek, snatches up the fawn as he lunges to his feet, crashes off through the foliage with the fawn cradled to his chest. the dogs take off after him.}
<B>__{dollying the creature}
<A>__{running full tilt, shrieking in terror all the way. trying to save the fawn. trying to save himself. the dogs are snapping at his heels, trying to sever his hamstrings and bring him down. he hears rushing water ahead, crashes headlong through a thicket...}
