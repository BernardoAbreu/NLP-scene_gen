<L>__{int: convenience store. day}
<A>__{pov randal: the empty counter and then a little girl comes into view, smiling and holding money. she can't be any more than five.}
<C>__{little girl}
<P>__{(innocently)}
<D>__{can i have a pack of cigarettes?}
<A>__{randal, without looking up from his magazine, completes the transaction. the little girl puts a cigarette in her mouth. randal hands her matches. dante returns to the counter as the girl skips away. dante holds a price gun.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? damn, that's eerie.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{you know how much money the average jizz mopper make per hour?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{what's a jizz mopper?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{he's the guy in those nudie booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{nudie booth?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{nudie booth. you've never been in a nudie booth?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i guess not.}
<A>__{a female customer pops items onto the counter. dante rings her up.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{oh, it's great. you step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{what kind of show?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do. these chicks do it all. they insert things into any opening in their body...any opening.}
<P>__{(to customer)}
<D>__{he's led a very sheltered life.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(indicating customer)}
<D>__{can we talk about this later?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{the jizz mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and i don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.}
<C>__{customer}
<P>__{(grabbing her bag, disgusted)}
<D>__{this is the last time i come to this place.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{using filthy language in front of the customers...you should both get fired.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{we're sorry, ma'am. we got a little carried away.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{well, i don't know if sorry can make up for it. i found your remarks highly offensive.}
<A>__{the customer stands silently, awaiting something.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{well, you think that's offensive...}
<A>__{randal flips open the magazine's centerfold a graphic picture of a woman with her vaginal lips and anus spread wide open.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{...then check this out. i think you can see her kidneys.}
<A>__{randal checks out the centerfold wistfully. dante frantically apologizes to the rapidly exiting customer.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{ma'am, ma'am, i'm sorry! please, wait a second, ma'am...}
<A>__{the customer is gone. dante's pursuit stops at the counter. dante turns on randal.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{why do you do things like that? you know she's going to come back and tell the boss.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{who cares? that lady's an asshole. everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. this job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i'm gonna hear it tomorrow.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{you gotta loosen up, my friend. you'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{what for? they don't bother me if i don't bother them.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{liar! tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{there aren't.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{how can you lie like that? why don't you vent? vent your frustration. come on, who pisses you off?}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{it's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{let's hear it.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{the milkmaids.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{the milkmaids?}
<A>__{insert: milk handler a woman pulls out gallon after gallon, looking deep into the cooler for that perfect container of milk.}
<C>__{dante }
<D>__{the women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. as if somewhere beyond all the other gallons is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.}
<B>__{end insert}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{you know who i can do without? i could do without the people in the video store.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{which ones?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{all of them.}
<A>__{montage insert #1 video jerks a series of people addressing the camera, asking the dumb questions.}
<C>__{first}

<C>__{second}
<P>__{(in front of stocked new release shelf)}
<D>__{do you have any new movies in?}
<C>__{third}
<D>__{do you have that one with the guy who was in that movie that was out last year?}
<B>__{end insert}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{and they never rent quality flicks; they always pick the most intellectually devoid movie on the rack.}
<A>__{montage insert #2 "ooooh!..." an identical series of customers finding their ideal choices.}
<C>__{first}
<D>__{ooooh! home alone!}
<C>__{second}
<D>__{ooooh! hook!}
<C>__{third}
<D>__{ooooh! navy seals!}
<B>__{end insert randal}
<A>__{it's like in order to join, they have to have an iq less than their shoe size.}
<B>__{dante}
<A>__{you think you get stupid questions? you should hear the barrage of stupid questions i get. montage insert #3 dumb questions a series of people standing in various locations throughout the convenience store, asking truly dumb questions.}
<C>__{first}
<P>__{(holding coffee)}
<D>__{what do you mean there's no ice? you mean i've gotta drink this coffee hot?!}
<C>__{second}
<P>__{(holding up item from clearly marked $.99 display)}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{third}
<P>__{(peeking in door)}
<D>__{do you sell hubcaps?}
<B>__{end insert}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{see? you vented. don't you feel better now?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{because my ex girlfriend is getting married.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{jesus, you got a one track mind. it's always caitlin, caitlin, caitlin...}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(jerking head toward door)}
<D>__{veronica!}
<A>__{dante gives randal a shove to shut him up. veronica enters the store, carrying books and something covered with aluminum foil.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{what happened to home by twelve?}
<A>__{dante is suddenly by her side, taking the books from under her arm.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{he still hasn't shown up. why aren't you in class?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{lit 101 got canceled, so i stopped home and brought you some lunch.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. what do you think it is? it's lasagne.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{really?}
<P>__{(kisses her forehead)}
<D>__{you're the best.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i'm glad you've calmed down a bit.}

<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(to o.c.)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<P>__{(to veronica)}
<D>__{yes, i've calmed down, i'm still not happy about it, but i've been able to deal.}
<A>__{randal makes loud slurping noises from o.c.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(to o.c.)}
<D>__{why don't you go back to the video store?}
<A>__{randal walks past the two, and pats veronica on the head. he exits.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you had to tell him.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i had to tell someone. he put it into perspective.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{at least he wasn't thirty six.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{and that made you feel better?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{and he said most of them are college guys, i've never met or seen.}
