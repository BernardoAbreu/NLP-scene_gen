<A>__{price is led into a lineup of 10 people, all nicaraguans. the room is narrow and so brightly lit that at first he covers his eyes. figures move in the shadows a guardia soldier moves up and down the lineup, stopping to point at a prisoner. in the line we recognize the waiter from the viking club. price speaks to the soldier in a calm, reasoned tone.}

<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{price holds up his hands he may be fearless, but he's not stupid. the soldier pulls a knife, then pulls his own tongue from his mouth, and makes motions with the knife as if cutting out his tongue. the message is clear price doesn't speak. the soldier walks up to the waiter and points. the waiter is frightened. through the shadows we see an officer talking with a civilian in a hat. the civilian points to a door. the waiter is led away through a door protesting desperately as he goes. the soldier moves to the next prisoner he too is led away. this repeats itself until the soldier arrives at price.}
<B>__{the soldier points to price}
<A>__{price's p.o.v. through the shadows the civilian is in a discussion with the officer it is clear that his opinion affects the decisions. for a moment price doesn't know where he's going to be led. the civilian points to a different door it opens and price steps down off the display rack into a room. through the door as price steps through, the action continues with the other nicaraguan prisoners. price looks around quickly, but the civilian and officer are gone. he is quickly shown into a bare office.}
