<A>__{jeffrey leaves and aunt barbara moves about tapping on the walls. she moves into a dark area and taps. something falls. she reaches down. in extreme closeup we see a termite walking by her shoe on the thick carpet. then in extreme closeup we see aunt barbara's fingers pinch the termite and bring it up in front of her thick glasses for a look. she looks at the termite, then looks back at the walls. we glide along the dark walls of the house.}
