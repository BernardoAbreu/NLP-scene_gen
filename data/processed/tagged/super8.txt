<D>__{december 16, 2010}
<A>__{over black we hear the dull sounds of industry; a muffled mass of machines, gears, steam. fade in on: a sign. twelve feet across. painted decades earlier, grim covered black, white and red. it reads in large 40's era, hand painted type, "safety is our primary concern!" then: "days since last accident" and below that, numbers, painted on hanging metal cards. four possible digits can hang here, but there are currently three: "784." slowly push in on this sign as a man appears, rising on a forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit. removes the "4" from its hooks. then removes the "8." then the "7." finally, he hangs up a number. "1." the man lowers out of frame as we creep even closer to the hanging single digit, wondering about the accident... and how bad it was and the factory sounds grow deafening and as it builds to a crescendo, we cut to silent blackness:}

<L>__{exterior joe's house porch day}
<A>__{shiny black loafers. black pants, three inches too long. we boom up, stopping at a boy's hand reaching into the black suit jacket pocket. pulls out a woman's gold necklace with a locket. he holds the locket. rubs it gently with his thumb. continue to boom up. we now see the boy's face. this is joe lamb, 14. on the precarious edge of adulthood. he looks out at the horizon with stricken eyes. he moves forward and we pan, so we're behind him now. in the frosty distance, past countless leafless trees and modest homes, is a steel mill. smokestacks and structures. the lifeblood of this late 70's town.}

<L>__{exterior joe's house day moments later}
<A>__{a wide shot. a grey, snow covered, early february day here in lillian, ohio. many cars are parked outside the house, notably a sheriff's department squad car in the driveway. joe, a vision of black on white in his too big black suit, now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years. he solemnly looks down at the locket he still holds. no doubt trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around his mother's neck. then a sound. joe looks up. a car has arrived a distinct 1968 buick gsx a yellow muscle car with a black racing stripe down its center. joe watches as the car sits there for a moment. then a man gets out. someone joe has seen before, but doesn't know personally. a man in his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt. he's not exactly sloppy, but if you look closely, you could tell he's been drinking. this is louis dainard. joe watches louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the porch and inside the house. joe's eyes glued on the house for a while. then he looks back to the locket. he opens it, and stares at the picture inside (which we do not see). and as he stares, tears come to his eyes. a moment broken by the sound of raised voices joe turns toward the house. after a beat, the sound of something breaking something glass. then the house back door bursts open joe cranes his neck and what he sees he'll never forget: his father, jack, leading an in pain and hand cuffed louis dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad car. when he slams the back door, he sees joe. sort of freezes as their eyes lock. but jack's more uncomfortable}
<T>__{than comforting:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will be home soon.}
<A>__{and jack gets into the car and drives away. joe watches them drive off. and after a beat, he looks down at the locket again. mom's just gone. finally he closes it and we hear an oddly loud snap and our screen goes black. over darkness: applause then a lone voice: "i want you... to want me!" drums kick in, cheap trick blasts. cut to:}
<L>__{exterior middle school day}
<A>__{hundreds of kids eagerly leave their last day of school for the year, winter a memory. girls emphatically embrace each other good bye. boys run off, just happy to be out. lots of "have a great summer!" dolly with joe, who walks through the crowd alone, backpack on shoulder. suddenly charles is there, red faced he hands joe pages:}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{that was the longest day ever here.}

<A>__{they head across the street to the 7 eleven. suddenly cary is there, a burn wrap on his right arm now:}
<C>__{cary charles}
<A>__{martin booted all over his locker, it was the grossest one yet let joe focus, he's reading.}

<A>__{as they head to the doors:}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i was returning that book on codes and ciphers she was in the silent reading section i thought, "screw it." so i asked her if she'd play hathaway's wife.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you talked to alice dainard really?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{you're not supposed to talk at all in the silent reading section }

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ was she nice? why is she doing this? i don't understand, we don't even know her }
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{maybe she just wants to be in a good movie, y'ever think of that?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i don't think that's what it is }
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i've been working on this movie for months. i'm just trying to make it good.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(reading, disapproving)}
<D>__{hathaway's married now? really?}
<A>__{charles swipes the pages from critic cary.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what was she reading?}

<A>__{darkness. then a door opens. it's detective hathaway (played by martin), in silhouette. he enters. it's an old warehouse, dirty, cobwebbed, crowded with crates, old machinery, chemical barrels and junk. the detective turns on his flashlight aims it sweeps it across the space the light hitting the lens for a moment. the detective walks through the spooky, dark space. a low, growling industrial drone makes the whole place oddly creepy. then: a sound quick but strange slithering and the detective aims his flashlight tense. he watches. waits. we see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through thick dust in the air. it's an old office door, ajar. hathaway is still. nervous. watching the door waiting for it to open... and then from the darkness behind him a terrifying open mouthed zombie appears attacks and the detective turns his flashlight knocked to the ground and hathaway falls too the wild eyed gaping mouthed zombie drooling as it tries to bite hathaway's flesh we recognize that the zombie is cary. actually, not a bad performance. the detective pulls out his gun but the zombie grabs his wrist they wrestle with the gun the zombie wanting to rip into hathaway's neck but hathaway sees three sharp tipped nails sticking out of an old piece of wooden crate and after a significant struggle, hathaway pushes the zombie back so his head is impaled by the nails which we see enter his skull!!! the zombie (stuck to the crate via the nails) screams and dies and just at hathaway catches his breath the image dims and freezes; the projector has just been stopped. we are in:}

<C>__{charles charles' mother }
<A>__{jesus, that's what i've been explaining: in the scene we're filming tonight, the wife telling the detecting she's scared for him, that she loves him charles! i'm coming!!! so when he investigates the zombie stuff you'll be scares you'll feel something because you don't want him to die because they love each other! does that make sense?}

<A>__{we hear a distant rumbling like something far off, but mechanical. then:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{shhh. this way.}
<A>__{they begin their walk into the dirt tunnel, a tall oval tunnel, twenty feet tall }
<L>__{interior tunnel #1 (w furniure) night}
<A>__{we're so far away, that the screen is mostly black, with a small speck of sparkly light. they come to an area littered with the stuff of a living room. they look up: another hole leading down, dug straight through a house. they continue, coming to an intersection where a new tunnel branches off.}
<L>__{interior tunnel #2 night}
<A>__{there's dim light from up ahead, where the tunnel bends. the rumbling mechanical sound louder now. joe and cary slowly move forward seeing something off camera that scares and amazes them all at once. it's a hundred foot diameter, forty foot tall underground space, filled with a mechanical marvel a massive, bizarre contraption combining thousands of mechanical pieces, from the missing microwaves, car engines, antennas, and countless other devices wires and cables hang and connect everywhere, all leading to the dirt ceiling, heading up, to somewhere above ground. the thick with fumes space chugs and hums with a slowly increasing pitch, as it it's warming up, getting ready to finally, actually work. they cross to the other side. cary bumps into a hanging sheriff pruitt. cary is about to scream, but joe puts a hand on his mouth and leads him away from pruitt.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{it's sheriff pruitt.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i know. cary look.}
<A>__{makeshift hanging bulbs provide some light; a number of other tunnels are visible from here, too. joe and cary look at the space in disbelief.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{we're under the water tower.}
<A>__{then joe sees something that makes him grab at cary's shirt. cary looks: through the mass of metal and machinery and dangling cables, at the other end of this underground experiment, is the creature. hunched over. back to the boys. and it's savagely eating something. it moves a bit: we see it's a human leg. joe and cary would scream if they didn't need to stay quiet. in a panicked whisper:}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{it's eating a person.}
<A>__{joe moves away from cary to get a better view of the other side of the machinery and there he sees, in an inset section of the rock wall, three human bodies, hanging lifeless from their feet, wrapped in some kind of thin shellac. tight on joe as he sees, among them, alice. his heart pounds, his resolve quadruples. cary sees her too }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{she's here. we're going to use your firecrackers.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{i don't think it's going to hurt it, joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{there are other tunnels.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i need you to make noise. lots of it, right here, in two minutes. make it loud and make it last gimme some sparklers.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(goes through his bag)}
<D>__{ why what are you gonna do ?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(takes sparklers and a lighter from cary)}
<D>__{make sure you're gone by the time it blows: you can't be here, you gotta run.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<A>__{but joe's already gone. stay with cary, who opens his backpack, starts pulling out his amazing array of explosives, glancing up to make sure he's out of the creature's view }
<L>__{interior tunnel #3 night}
<A>__{move fast with joe as he races, a lit sparkler giving him his light the mechanical rumbling all but gone now. joe runs, looking for another way into the creature's massive space he finally finds another intersection he turns into it he disappears down the tunnel }
<L>__{interior tunnel #2 night}
<A>__{cary's made a long, insane pile of firecrackers he uses an open m 80 and begins laying a squiggly, long line of gun powder back, away from the firecrackers away from the entrance to the creature's contraption space.}
<L>__{interior tunnel #4 night}
<A>__{joe races down the dirt tunnel, the sound of the mechanical rumbling and its increasing pitch getting louder. the sparkler dies as light begins to reveal joe, who slows peers around the dirt tunnel bend he is now on the other side of the space. he sees the creature then looks across to the lifeless body of alice. his heart sinks.}
<L>__{interior tunnel #2 night}
<A>__{cary's done laying out the charges he pulls out his lighter ffft! ffft! the damn thing won't light }
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{ come on damnit!}
<A>__{fft! fft! no go he keeps trying.}
<L>__{interior tunnel #4 night}
<A>__{joe watches as the creature finishes with its meal and heads for the other hanging bodies push in on joe, desperate }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ cary, come on, come on }
<L>__{interior tunnel #2 night}
<A>__{cary frantically trying the lighter fft! fft! fft!}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{ damnit!!!}
<A>__{he looks up watches the creature grab and pull alice's lifeless body down from her hanging position it moves with her to where he was eating the teacher cary shakes the lighter, starting to cry and he flicks it and fffffth!!! it lights! he touches it on the gun powder and runs off }
<L>__{interior mechanical contraption space night}
<A>__{the creature pulls away the fibrous covering over alice its tentacles slither out.}
<L>__{interior tunnel #4 night}
<A>__{watching this is horror, joe's about to run in just as babababababababam!!! the creature jerks up from its almost meal of alice, looks toward the explosive sounds, then leaves her, quickly moving for the tunnel }
<L>__{interior tunnel #2 night}
<A>__{the creature arrives in the smoke filled tunnel, as the fireworks fill the tunnel with bright, multi colored lights }
<L>__{interior mechanical contraption space night}
<A>__{joe sprints in, gets to alice lightly slaps her face }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ alice, please please }
<P>__{(nothing slap)}
<D>__{alice, wake up!}
<A>__{nothing so he fucking slaps her face hard and she suddenly inhales sharply, he eyes wide, terrified }
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{alice! you're alive! can you hear me? are you okay?!}
<A>__{she's catching her breath, nodding, looking at him, amazed }
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{what is this? what are you doing here?!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm just doing the best i can to save you.}
<A>__{she grabs him and hugs him tight, teary and grateful during which quietly:}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{how did you know?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{your dad. he told me. he was worried. and flipping out.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ we need to move }
<A>__{but she breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt, intense:}
<C>__{tina }
<D>__{excuse me?}
<A>__{tina, a 24 year old , disoriented woman with curlers in her hair, wakes up.}
<C>__{tina }
<D>__{where are we?}
<L>__{interior mechanical contraption space night}
<A>__{joe and alice have helped down one familiar face: sheriff pruitt. they're out of breath, but their survival instinct has kicked in:}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{i left my bag in my car. then i went to my car to get my bag }
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{it's been experimented on for years. it's terrified and exhausted and hungry, it just wants to go home. when it touched me, i knew }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{alice, help me get the sheriff down.}
<T>__{time cut:}
<C>__{sheriff pruitt}
<D>__{follow me. i can get us out of here.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{sheriff, we came that way.}
<C>__{sheriff pruitt}
<D>__{don't argue with me.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{come on, kids, let's go with the sheriff.}
<A>__{joe and alice follow. they run into a tunnel. we push in on the mechanical device the pitch increasing more now as if it's about to "function" the creature returns and sees that the humans are gone. he takes off.}
<L>__{interior tunnel #4 night}
<A>__{sparkler lighting the way, we're with joe and alice pruitt and tina behind them:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{sheriff, i really think we're going the wrong way.}
<C>__{pruitt}
<D>__{we'll talk about it when we get up top.}
<A>__{they continue following pruitt.}
<C>__{cary }
<D>__{joe!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i told you to get out!}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{i thought this was the way out. i tried! hey, alice, welcome back }
<C>__{pruitt}
<D>__{kids, come on, we gotta go.}
<A>__{but he's looking back and his sparkler illuminates the creature that is right up ahead and tina screams they all do as pruitt turns and is taken, lifted high, killed in the dark as they all turn and run pruitt's horrible screams terrifying as the foursome sprint in the opposite direction! after running hard for a beat: they haul ass, but after a long moment tina is grabbed away}
<L>__{into the darkness!!! her screams continue behind them }
<A>__{they run and run and run, but then boom: they hit a dead end. a dirt wall. no more tunnels. no options. out of breath, they turn but dare not go back toward the horrifying blackness. the only sound the sparkler, their erratic breathing and the distant increasing pitch of the creature's mechanical device. the creature is there forty feet from them, approaching! alice screams she and cary more back against the wall and the creature moves for them, but joe yells as}
<T>__{the thing passes the fireworks:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{go! you don't wanna be here, go!}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{joe, what are you doing?}
<A>__{it keeps coming past the fireworks, amazingly backlit as it lumbers toward joe, desperately trying to stand ground:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{we understand! we know how hard it's been! but not everyone is horrible!}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{joe, shut up, it's gonna kill you!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you're gonna be okay now!}
<A>__{and it grabs joe and lifts him alice and cary scream as joe is being squeezed he looks into the glossy black eyes of this beast, which could kill him at any time but in this moment of fear comes something else. simple truth he whispers, shakily:}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{ i know bad things happen bad things happen, but you can still live. you can still live, you can still live, you're gonna be okay }
<A>__{just as we think the creature's gonna kill him: a distant mechanical tone the creature turns, acknowledging that sound then to joe again. it considers him. its eyes' covering peels away revealing huge, wet, vulnerable eyes. and the thing looks at him. really looks at him. in a way, as you imagine his mother once had. and joe feels this too. and after a long, scary beat, the creature sets him down. joe backs up as the creature turns fast and speeds away. joe is stunned. shocked relief. alice and cary, too }
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{okay, wait a minute, what?!}
<A>__{then, over the high pitched mechanical sound comes rumblings like thunder from above and the three look up }
<L>__{exterior lillian, ohio main street night}
<A>__{the kids round a corner on main street, countless metallic objects anything metal and loose has been invisibly dragged floating toward the water tower at different speeds and with different personalities, metal objects bullet}
<B>__{to the top of the tower and stick there.}
<A>__{suddenly, the diner window shatters as a stove rips through it we pan with it as it tumbles toward and up the water tower! hundreds of objects move past them from bicycles to silverware and sinks! dishwashers and tvs smash through the town's appliance store window a tv floats, unplugged, past the kids and it is on and shows an episode from the twilight zone all things eventually slamming into the water tower, the objects beginning to crush together, forming one dense metallic mass! bam! bambam! sounds like gun blasts the kids turn: behind them are the red cargo containers one by one those cubes burst through the containers: bam! bambambam! bambam! and they slam into the water tower and they begin to form an odd, huge crescent shape above the tower! alice is cry laughing at seeing it work }
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{ what's he doing...?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{... he's making a model.}
<A>__{again and again, pieces fly overhead, beginning to form what is clearly an alien craft lights beginning to illuminate from inside as it continues one of the spotlights illuminating a jeep that has just arrived: jack gets out. he sees joe. joe is surprised to see him alice concerned.}
<B>__{but then the kids are both incredulous to see jack help louis}
<A>__{out of the jeep the two men move through the debris in the streets, stunned at the activity surrounding them, but focused on their children; a tumbling typewriter almost takes out jack, but he avoids it as it shoots up to the water}

<A>__{jack gets to his son holds his shoulders looks deeply}
<L>__{into his eyes, touches his face and embraces him }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ i got you. i got you.}
<A>__{louis, crying, desperately sorry and she sees this in his sad, wounded face she holds out a hand he takes it and pulls her into an embrace, hugging his daughter desperately. behind them, the ship continues to take shape, almost fully formed but here, as he is being hugged by his father, joe looks down: something in his pocket is moving he considers it, confused for a moment but he reaches in and pulls it out. his mother's necklace and he holds the chain, but the locket pulls toward the water tower wanting to go. joe knows what this means. he looks up at his father, who also understand. and this is when we go into slow motion from here until the end. after a long beat, joe holds the necklace up, toward the tower the thing pulling... tears in joe's eyes as he looks up at it not wanting to let go, but knowing he must. jack, heartsick, watches his son, on the verge of letting go. alice watches joe, on the verge of tears except joe just can't bring himself to do it, not now, not ever. but then something happens. pulled by the invisible force, the locket pops open. and we see what's inside. a photograph of joe's mother. a young woman, holding her one small baby. and joe looks at his mother and in this moment, she at him and jack's eyes suddenly well with tears alice, too, tears streaming down her face and finally jack reaches out and puts his hand on his son's shoulder which was all joe needed, really. and finally... after all... joe lets go. our score soars as, in slow motion, the necklace shoots across the main street up to the water tower! and when it hits, the entire tower implodes from pressure a fireworks like explosion of water bursts and showers the street as the majestic ship completes its formation and that's when joe sees the creature, leaving climbing up the water tower and enters his ship and it begins to lift. as it takes off, the weight of the tower is too much: it}

<A>__{and we push in as donny sleeps, the reflection of the rising ship seen in his windshield }
<L>__{exterior lillian, ohio main street night}
