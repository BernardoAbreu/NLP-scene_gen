<L>__{128. interior williams car church night}
<A>__{sandy laughs as she pulls the car curbside in a quiet street by a church. the church pipe organ music drifts softly into the night.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{you want to tell me about it?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{. ok. it's a strange world, sandy. this is what i have found out. what i think i have found out. dorothy vallens is married to a man named don. they have a son. i think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named frank who has now cut off both of don's ears. i think he is holding them to make her do things for him. i think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. i call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. i don't know what he does but i think he's on drugs supplied by frank. frank is a very dangerous man.}
<C>__{sandy}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{wow. should you tell my father?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{i don't see how i can. and i can't prove any of this. i got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{you saw a lot in one night.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{. actually. i've been in twice.}
<C>__{sandy}
<P>__{(uneasy)}
<D>__{twice. without her sensing anything?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<P>__{(lying)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sandy}
<P>__{(pausing)}
<D>__{did you see her undressed?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{yeah. i mean. a little, . you know.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<P>__{(a searching, slight smile)}
<D>__{that doesn't bother you, does it?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{who, me? why should it?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<P>__{(seeing some jealousy and and happy for it)}
<D>__{that's what i thought.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{you're sure right. it is a strange world.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{why are there people like frank. why is there so much trouble in this world.?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{i don't know. i had a dream. in fact. the night i met you.}
<P>__{(she reflects silently on this before proceeding)}
<D>__{. in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. i guess. until the robins come there is trouble.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{yeah i guess so.}
<P>__{(he turns to her)}
<D>__{you're a neat girl.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{so are you.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i mean you're a neat guy. we better get back.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{i guess so. you want to help me watch frank?. i'm going to stake out frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.}
<A>__{sandy starts the car and pulls out into the street. they begin driving back.}
