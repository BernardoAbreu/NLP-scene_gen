<L>__{exterior empty park morning}
<A>__{though the park is in a poor neighborhood, it is relatively clean. the park is quiet and unused this morning except for two young girls making their way across it. prominent in the background sits an old run down yellow car that jessica drove to the park. jessica is carrying katie, a plain, tiny seven year old girl, in piggy back fashion, with katie's legs dangling out in front of jessica. katie holds jessica tight around the collarbone.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{doesn't carlos want his car back?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{he's letting me borrow it.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{well then why were you late if you had his car?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{i slept late.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{were you drinking last night?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{no. but thanks for asking.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{were you doing drugs?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{katie, i told you, drugs are for losers.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{and you're not a loser.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{and neither are you.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{but it's okay to drink.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{when you're older it'll be okay.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{how old are you?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{old enough.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{but you're not twenty one yet. the law says you have to be twenty one.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{katie, can you not ask so many questions today? i've got too much to think about.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{cause it's your birthday?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{happy birthday!}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{jessica begins walking faster, soon breaking into a crippled run, the weight of katie bearing down on her. they reach their destination a rickety old merry go round. jessica turns her back to the merry go round, allowing katie to step onto it.}
<C>__{jessica }
<D>__{hold on tight or you'll get hurt.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i will.}
<A>__{katie grabs a handle as jessica begins to spin the machine. katie sails around happily as jessica steps back to watch, katie's youthful enthusiasm lulling jessica into a nostalgic gloom.}
