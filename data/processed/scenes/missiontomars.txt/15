<L>__{interior mars one hab. day}
<A>__{the crew of mars one kirov, willis, and cote have joined luke, gathered around some display monitors. they're in nasa jumpsuits; the hab has artificial atmosphere, enhanced gravity, and heat. all are captivated by what they see. on a}
<B>__{video screen}
<A>__{we see a low angle image of an elongated, rubble and dirt covered mountain. hard to tell scale, but it looks huge. what's most striking, however, is a white peak barely protruding through the rubble two thirds of the way along the mountain's ridgeline. its whiteness is in clear contrast to the typical rust orange of the surrounding rubble; what's more, this strange little peak also displays an oddly smooth, multi planed symmetry.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what the hell is that?}
<C>__{cote}
<D>__{no idea, boss.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{where is it?}
<A>__{cote glances at the others. they're all smirking, as if they share some secret joke luke's not yet in on.}
<C>__{willis}
<D>__{you don't wanna know.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{c'mon, what's so funny? gimme the coordinates.}
<A>__{he leans over to read a digital gauge, but cote covers it with her hand, enjoying the tease.}
<C>__{cote}
<D>__{latitude 41 degrees north, longitude 9 degrees west.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{the plains of cydonia. so?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{oh no. you're not telling me }
<A>__{they all laugh as the other shoe drops. luke's expression is incredulous, exasperated.}
<C>__{cote}
<D>__{oui. exactement! it's kirov's fault, he picked today's sector.}
<C>__{kirov}
<D>__{hey, c'mon! we've got a scientific duty to check that thing out.}
<A>__{luke sits, taking over the ares remote control from cote. they all watch as he fine tunes the image, trying without success to coax more resolution.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{great. that's great. the first anomaly we hit, and it's gotta be in the one place guaranteed to make nasa look ridiculous... you know how many books have been written about that damned mountain?}
<C>__{cote}
<D>__{the egyptians put it there.}
<C>__{kirov}
<D>__{no, the amazons.}
<C>__{willis}
<D>__{no, it was little green men!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{and all because a couple of lousy impact craters happen to look like eye sockets. if this gets out, we'll have every ufo kook on earth spouting off on the six o'clock news... c'mon, people, gimme a read here. is that a cinder cone?}
<C>__{kirov}
<D>__{nah, too smooth. too angular. volcanic upwelling?}
<C>__{cote}
<D>__{no fissures. no caldera.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it's an upwelling, for sure. but maybe not volcanic...}
<A>__{the others look at him, puzzled. luke leans in closer, with growing excitement. he points to the screen.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{look at the color. and see how shiny it is? i could swear that's ice...}
<C>__{cote}
<D>__{this far south?}
<C>__{willis}
<D>__{impossible. you can't have ice at this latitude. not unless...}
<A>__{they look at each other, luke's excitement now leaping from one to another of them. they're almost trembling.}
<C>__{willis}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{how far away is it?}
<C>__{kirov}
<D>__{sixteen kilometers northeast. take us twenty minutes to get there.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(considers a moment)}
<D>__{let's send a packet to micker. then we'll go check it out.}
