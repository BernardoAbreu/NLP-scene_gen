<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{corporal howard, name some reasons why a marine would get a code red?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{being late for platoon or company meetings, keeping his barracks in disorder, falling back on a run...}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{have you ever received a code red?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{yes sir. we were doing seven man assault drills, and my weapon slipped. it's just cause it was over a hundred degrees and my palms were sweaty and i'd forgot to use the resin like we were taught.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{and what happened?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{that night the guys in my squad threw a blanket over me and took turns punching me in the arm for five minutes. then they poured glue on my hands. and it worked, too, 'cause i ain't never dropped my weapon since.}

<C>__{howard}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{you got a code red 'cause your palms were sweaty. why didn't santiago, this burden to his unit, ever get one?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{dawson wouldn't allow it, sir.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{dawson wouldn't allow it.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{the guys talked tough about santiago, but they wouldn't go near him. they were too afraid of dawson, sir.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{object. the witness is characterizing.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i will rephrase. jeffrey, did you ever want to give santiago a code red?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{why didn't you?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{'cause dawson'd kick my butt, sir.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{good enough. lt. ross is gonna ask you some questions now.}

<C>__{howard}
<D>__{sir, you see, code red is a term we use it's just used down at gitmo, sir. i don't know if it actually }
<A>__{ross has produced another book.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{we're in luck, then. the marine corps guide for sentry duty, navy base guantanamo bay, cuba. i assume we'll find the term code red and its definition in this book, am i correct?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{no sir.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{no? corporal howard, i'm a marine. is their no book, no manual or pamphlet, no set of orders or regulations that let me know that, as a marine, one of my duties is to perform code reds?}
<C>__{howard}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{no sir. no books, sir.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{no further questions.}

<C>__{howard}
<D>__{lt. kaffee, that's not in the book, sir.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i don't understand, how did you know where the enlisted men's mess hall was if it's not in this book?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{i guess i just followed the crowd at chow time, sir.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{no more questions.}
<A>__{kaffee chucks the book back on ross's desk.}
