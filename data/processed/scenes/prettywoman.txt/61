<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{vivian.}
<C>__{mr. thomas}
<D>__{miss vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the regent beverly wilshire.}
<A>__{vivian says nothing.}
<C>__{mr. thomas }
<D>__{mr. harris, however, is a very special customer. and we like to think of our special customers as friends. as a customer, we would expect mr. harris to sign in any additional guests. but as a friend, we're willing to overlook it, i'm assuming you're a... relative?}
<A>__{vivian finds herself nodding.}
<C>__{mr. thomas }
<D>__{i thought so. you must be his...?}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{niece?}
<C>__{mr. thomas}
<D>__{of course. naturally when mr. harris leaves, i won't see you in this hotel again.}
<A>__{vivian bites her lower lip, nods.}
<C>__{mr. thomas }
<D>__{good. we understand one another.}
<P>__{(as a gentle afterthought:)}
<D>__{i would also encourage you to dress in a more appropriate manner.}
<A>__{vivian's face screws up as she tries hard not to cry.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{that's what i was trying to do.}
<A>__{she can't help it, the tears come. vivian pulls out the money edward gave her. she drops it on the desk. it's a moist looking wad now.}
<C>__{vivian }
<D>__{i was trying to get some other clothes... but... they wouldn't... they made me feel like shit...}
<A>__{she can't go on. mr. thomas politely glances at the money. he unfolds it, smoothes it and hands it back to her. he sighs. he picks up the phone. he dials.}
<C>__{mr. thomas}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{women's clothing.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{bridget, please.}

<D>__{bridget, hello, this is barnard thomas over at the regent beverly wilshire. well, thank you, that's flattering. i'd like to ask a favor of you. i'm going to send someone over. her name is vivian. she's a guest of ours. a very special guest.}
<A>__{he glances at vivian. with those simple words, he'd made her feel better.}
<C>__{mr. thomas }
<D>__{she's from out of town and she needs a little help in dressing. perhaps you could help her out. thank you very much. she'll be right over.}
<A>__{he sets the phone down and smiles patronizingly at vivian.}
<C>__{mr. thomas }
<D>__{there you are. if you have any other problems, come ask for me personally. i'm mr. thomas.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{barney.}
