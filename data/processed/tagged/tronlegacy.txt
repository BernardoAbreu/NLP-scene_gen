<D>__{a quantum digitizer. prototype, only one of its kind. flynn designed it to break down physical objects into high resolution data. luckily, we salvaged his key components and back engineered the system.}

<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{we think it happened.}
<A>__{meg agrees. rush gets a chill.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{it was a fluke. but flynn worked for years, down here, trying to make it happen again. one day a test went bad. a plasma reaction destroyed this lab. flynn was reduced to ash.}

<C>__{rush}
<D>__{i was never told how he died. it was all just weird, you know, because flynn's the guy who hired me. but he was strange, kept to himself, i didn't know what job i was supposed to be doing.}
<P>__{(to sinclair)}
<D>__{then you came onboard, the company woke up, we had a direction. it was kind of pathetic, because by the time flynn died, everybody was too busy to care.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{he was brilliant in his way, but genius without discipline leads to nothing. his reckless habits nearly ruined this company... and for sure got him killed.}
<A>__{a last look at the charred remains of flynn's machine.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{that kind of accident can't happen again. we've upgraded the system in ways flynn never could. the chips didn't exist until now.}

<C>__{meg}
<D>__{hey, jo jo. have good trip?}
<A>__{she puts the rat in on her shoulder, feeds it a tidbit. then she scrutinizes rush. rush considers meg, then turns to sinclair.}

<D>__{greetings.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{hey guys. this is rush and his main man krod. they defected from plexor's forces to fight with us.}
<A>__{a buzz of hope penetrates gloom. nobody has defected from plexor before.}
<C>__{code monk n1j}
<D>__{we made progress decoding x net's power supply encryption.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{excellent. let's see.}
<A>__{in a make shift lab, code monkeys demonstrate, working at mind boggling speed, assembling a small intricate hologon device (conical pyramid shaped encryption key).}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{i've seen that somewhere.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{it's the encryption pattern on plexor's disk.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{good eyes. we've got mole programs who score chunks of plexor's personal code anywhere they can find it. these guys fit the pieces together.}
<C>__{flynn }
<D>__{it can take a quadrillion combinations.}
<C>__{code monk j2r}
<D>__{we just snagged the last piece, but the battle cost us big time.}

<D>__{time is running out!}
<A>__{rush approaches code monkeys as they toil blur speed, trying to fit the final code piece a flat square. pyramidal hologon looks exactly like the x net desk toy we saw in rush's cubicle.}

<D>__{yow. i get tired just watching these dudes.}
<A>__{rush sees: compilers try to fit the square inside the pyramid.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{just for laughs, try putting the circle on top of the pyramid.}
<C>__{code monks}
<P>__{(unison)}
<D>__{that's incongruous.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{if i'm wrong, ding me.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{what have we got to lose? try it.}
<A>__{code monkeys place the square on top of the pyramid. bingo. square spins into a circle, latches and lights the entire hologon lattice. intricate 3d code patterns animates.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{not bad.}

<D>__{good thing you didn't terminate us.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{how do we use this thing to shut down plexor?}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(picks up hologon)}
<D>__{it's a copy of plexor's master key. we can break into any x net facility and fry the power supply.}

<D>__{but once plexor knows we have it, he'll change the code.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{yep. we've got one shot.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{then we should take out the power supply to plexor's main server.}

<C>__{quantz}
<D>__{we can pull it off, can't we flynn? one final assault on plexor's central server?}
<C>__{boole}

<A>__{flynn sits nearby, trying to patch his corrupted leg.}

<D>__{do they have any idea our world exists? do they understand what a user is?}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{programs once connected freely with their users. but plexor shut down the i o ports, severing all links. he controls all contact with the world we once knew. programs operate on his instructions or none at all.}
