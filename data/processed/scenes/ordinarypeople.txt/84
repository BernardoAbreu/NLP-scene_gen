<C>__{friend}
<D>__{say. after going to a new high, it falls to 112 1 4 and then rallies on good volume. i shoot an order to buy 4000 at the market. if i get the 4000 shares at 113 3 4, i know something's wrong.}
<C>__{friend }
<D>__{but suppose the order to buy the 4000 shares i put in at the price of 113 3 4, i get 2000 at 114, 500 at 114 1 4, and the rest on the way up, so the last 500 shares i pay 115 1 2, then i know i'm right.i'm going to peel off here.}
