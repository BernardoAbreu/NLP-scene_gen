<A>__{it's beautiful here, striking and sad. now on foot, castor follows eve up a bluff, through a phalanx of graves with no idea where she's leading him. finally she stops at a crucifix topped headstone. castor joins her and reads the etched marble stone:}
<D>__{matthew archer, age 5 beloved son & brother we cherish you always}
<A>__{stunned, castor watches as eve kneels beside the marker.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{happy birthday, matty.}
<A>__{she places a few child's toys on the marker... a shark... a little bulldozer... a spaceship. overwhelmed with grief, she collapses into castor.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{he took our baby, jon. he took our little boy.}
<A>__{full screen castor's face he stares at the grave of the boy he killed the boy whose mother is weeping into his chest. the ever present smirk is long gone as castor stiffly returns eve's embrace maybe, just maybe, feeling the victim's pain.}

<D>__{stop crying... stop crying... stop ...}
