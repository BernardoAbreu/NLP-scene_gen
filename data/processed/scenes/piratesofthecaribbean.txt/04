<L>__{interior governor's mansion foyer day}
<A>__{the caller, dressed in rough clothing, stands in the foyer, looking very out of place, and knowing it. he holds a long presentation case. he polishes the toes of his boots on the back of his calves, but it doesn't help.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{ah, mr. turner! it's good to see you again!}
<A>__{the caller turns it is will turner. handsome, with a watchful demeanor that gives him weight beyond his years.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{good day, sir.}
<P>__{(holds out the case)}
<D>__{i have your order.}
<A>__{swann hurries to him, opens the case. inside is a beautiful dress sword and scabbard. swann takes it out reverently.}
<C>__{will }
<C>__{will }
<D>__{the blade is folded steel. that's gold filigree laid into the handle. if i may }
<A>__{he takes the sword from swann, and balances it on one finger at the point where the blade meets the guard.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{perfectly balanced. the tang is nearly the full width of the blade..}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{impressive. .. very impressive. commodore norrington will be pleased, i'm sure. do pass my compliments on to your master.}
<A>__{will's face falls. clearly, the work is his, and he is proud of it. with practiced ease, he flips the sword around, catches it by the hilt and returns it to the case.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(bows slightly)}
<D>__{i shall. a craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated }
<A>__{he stops speaking abruptly, staring past swann elizabeth stands on the stairs. granted, the dress may be painful to wear, but holy smokes!}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{elizabeth! you look stunning!}
<A>__{will tries to speak, but can't. he gives up, smiles to himself, and simply nods emphatically.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{will! it's so good to see you!}
<A>__{her hand goes to the chain around her throat (the medallion is hidden in the bodice of her dress).}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{i dreamt about you last night. will reacts with surprise: "really?}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate }
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(ignores her father)}
<D>__{about the day we met. do you remember?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i could never forget it, miss swann.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{will, how many times must i ask you to call me 'elizabeth'?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{at least once more, miss swann. as always.}
<A>__{elizabeth is disappointed and a little hurt by his response.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{well said! there's a boy who understands propriety. now, we must be going.}
<A>__{swann takes the case from will, opens the door for elizabeth. elizabeth straightens her back, gathers her skirts and strides past will.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{good day, mr. turner.}
