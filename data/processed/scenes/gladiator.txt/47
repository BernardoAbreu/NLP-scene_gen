<A>__{maximus and juba share a small, filthy cell. the cell door faces the open compound. across the compound they can see the much more comfortable cells of the "star" gladiators such as vibius. they both sit on the floor, leaning against the wall. juba is eating a bowl of food with a wooden spoon. maximus' bowl and spoon are at his side, he has not touched them.}

<D>__{in the village i come from there was a man once. he went fishing one day and his boat was attacked by crocodiles. one of them ate his leg. he pulled himself to the shore and a lion attacked him. it ate one of his arms. he dragged himself through the desert on the way home and a scorpion stung his eye. so he only had one eye. when he reached the village i sat with him. i said, "you have lost a leg, an arm and one eye. you must have a mighty will to live." he said, "no, lord, it's just better than the alternative."}
