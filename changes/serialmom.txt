She waves cheerfully out the kitchen window to the passing GARBAGEMEN on the back of a Baltimore County garbage truck and then turns to her husband and children and expertly begins to serve breakfast. DAD, EUGENE, the ultimate nice guy and a dentist by trade, divides the morning paper up between himself and son CHIP, a cute semi-hip kid who is still in high-school.  Daughter, MISTY, a pretty and slightly overweight college student, frantically prices the junk she plans on selling at the flea market after classes while gulping down a light breakfast.}

Ripple effects dissolve to the present as the wheels of MOM'S car skid to a stop.  The car door opens and MOM's sensible shoes step out as "Mom Psycho Theme" builds. MOM closes car door quietly, watches DOTTIE HINKLE up the street undetected and then takes the scissors from her purse and hides them up her sleeve. As MOM sneaks up street towards DOTTIE, intercut are obsessional flashbacks of details of the traumatic parking place incident;  MOM'S POV of DOTTIE pulling into space, DOTTIE'S maddening nonchalance as she snottily gets out of her car and trots right past MOM without the slightest apology, MOM'S sputtering face paralyzed with anger when she realizes there is nowhere else to park. Back in the present, MOM starts walking faster and faster as she sees DOTTIE begin to pack up her gardening tools to go back inside her house. Arriving just a second too late as DOTTIE closes the door behind her, MOM spots a can of gasoline near DOTTIE's lawnmower.  Thinking fast, MOM dumps gas on DOTTIE's mail in the mailbox on porch, lights it on fire and runs from the flames, happily throwing a coin into DOTTIE's wishing well as an afterthought.

"CAMEL LIPS" incites the crowd from the stage to fight back against the police. SCOTTY is running toward stage in terror, looking over his shoulder and seeing MOM gaining on him. DAD gets caught in a mob of slam dancers and is lifted off his feet and tossed through the air by the crowd. MISTY, CHIP and BIRDIE see DAD airborne and start slamming into the crowd to save him.

The LEAD SINGER thinks it's a joke, pours a little Jack Daniels on the smouldering corpse and then jumps back in comic over-reaction when the flames light up again. MOM, now caught in the front row of laughing slam-dancing spectators, turns to her dumb-struck family, smiles and sticks fingers in her ears, mimicking that the music is much too loud. DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD slamdance MOM from both sides and knock her to the ground and handcuff her. DAD puts his arms around CHIP, MISTY and BIRDIE as they hang their heads in sorrow.
