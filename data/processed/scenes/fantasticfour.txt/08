<L>__{exterior lake launch facility day}
<A>__{a helicopter shot through trees. we soar over timberland, and find something massive looming on the horizon: a spacecraft. a sleek take on a space shuttle. modern tech combined with industrial design that nasa could never afford. the craft's nose is pointed straight up, ready for launch. workers in jumpsuits are scattered around the two hundred foot tall scaffolding, performing routine checks.}
<L>__{exterior gantry overlook day}
<A>__{ben stares up at the craft. a sneer on his face.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{can't do it. i cannot do it.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{external srbs, orbital system engines. its just like the shuttles you flew in }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no. i cannot take orders from that underwear model. that wingnut washed out of nasa for sneaking two victoria secret wannabes into a flight simulator.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{youthful high spirits.}
<A>__{they walk toward the base of the scaffolding.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{they crashed it into a wall. a flight simulator.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{i'm sure he's matured since then.}
<A>__{close on johnny storm, leaning over to kiss a hot redhead. pull back to reveal he's riding a motorcycle, and she's driving a red corvette with license plate: frankie. pick up reed and ben, watching through binoculars.}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{when have i asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?}
<C>__{ben}
