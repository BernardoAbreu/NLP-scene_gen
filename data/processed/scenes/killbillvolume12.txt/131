<T>__{we cut to pai mei:}
<A>__{he's just like he was in the films earlier. long white hair, long white beard, long white eyebrowes, same long flowing white robe. everything's the same, except he's older, by about a hundred years. he sits stone still in his sitting area on the other side of the sheer scarlet scrim.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{bill is your master, is he not?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yes, he is.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{your master tells me you're not entirely unschooled. what training do you possess?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{i am proficient in a combination of tiger and crane style. and i am more than proficient in the exquisite art of the samurai sword.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<P>__{(he makes a snorting sound)}
<D>__{the exquisite art of the samurai sword. don't make me laugh. your so called exquisite art, is only fit for japanese fat heads. you really are a silly ass.}
<A>__{this brings up the bride's eye...she glares at the old man.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{impudent dog! you dare glare at me!}
<A>__{she lowers her eyes.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{i'm sorry master }
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{ silence! i do not wish to hear your unintelligible excuses.}
<A>__{pause...}
<B>__{then...}
<A>__{pai mei softly laughs to himself, and strokes his long white beard...}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{your anger amuses me. do you believe you are my match?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{are you aware i kill at will?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{is it your wish to die?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{then you must be stupid. rise stupid, and let me get a better look at your ridiculous face.}
<A>__{she rises. cu the bride through the scrim, eyes down. pai mei laughs to himself again;}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{you breathe hard. the one hundred steps robbed you of your wind. so your stupidity is matched only by your weakness. is there anything you do well? oh yes, you speak japanese. i despise the goddamn japs. i would of thought an american would be immune to their pompous posturing. apparently i was wrong. go to that drawer.}
<A>__{the blonde woman goes to a large wooden drawer. she opens the drawer; it's filled with just about every type of edged weapon.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{remove the sword.}
<A>__{the bride removes a large heavy steel chinese sword. pai mei rises from his sitting position, for the first time, parts the scrim, and approaches the bride.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{let's see how good you really are. try and land a blow. if you land a single blow, i will bow down and call you master.}
<A>__{the bride doesn't need a second invitation, she attacks with the sword. he deftly moves out of the way. the fighting style is now like an old shaw brothers film, with pai mei dodging at will all of her rapid sword slashes. quick and skillful as her moves are, they're also full of effort and frustration. while pai mei effortlessly moves out of the sword's path. he's amused, and speaks while they fight;}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{come now woman, can't you even hit an old man?}
<A>__{she tries more...}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{your ability really is quite poor.}
<A>__{he strikes her with a blow to her chest, delivered with an open palm, that sends her flying back hard against the wall. she clutches her chest, and coughs up some blood. pai mei laughs as he strokes his long white beard.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{ha ha ha ha ha! i've fought cripples who posed more of a challenge. now fight, goddamn you!}
<A>__{she attacks with a wild cat's fury. he hops and ducks and dodges her sword easily. he leaps high up in the air, and lands standing on the blade of her sword. the bride looks down the blade of her sword and can't believe it. pai mei smiles at her and says;}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{from here you can get an excellent view of my foot.}
<A>__{he does a backflip off the sword, kicking the bride in the face in mid somersault sending her crashing through a wood}
<B>__{wall.}
<A>__{the bride emerges from the hole in the wall. pai mei stands waiting for her, twirling the sword in his hand like a cheerleader twirling a baton, till the twirling stops. the sword's handle is pointed towards the bride.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{give up? or care to try again?}
<A>__{the bride's face shows determination. not to win, not even to land a blow, that she knows is impossible. this man's ability is truly amazing. however be that as it may, she's determined not to quit, and through not quitting, she's determined to distinguish herself in his eyes...in some way. she takes the sword from him and tries again. but this time, pai mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the sword, manipulating it into positions that would do the young girl harm...like bringing the blade up against her other arm...poised to cut it off.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{that blade's sharp. careful not to cut off your own arm.}
<A>__{...then he twists her arm, till the blade's against her own throat.... ...then twists again till it's against her hip... ...then twists again while kicking her leg, till the blade's edge is against her thigh...}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{if you can't fight any better than that, what use do you have for a leg?}
<A>__{he lets go of her arms, she swings furiously at him... ...he calmly spins out of the way. then, he kicks her in the stomach, doubling her over, then he brings the sword between her legs, blade edge against her crotch.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{now that really would be a shame.}
<A>__{he takes the sword from her grasp... swings once... the blades's against her jugular. he swings twice... the blade's against the pocket of her throat. he swings a third time... the blade's against the nipple of her right breast.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{your swordsmanship is amateur at best.}
<A>__{he tosses the sword in the air, catching it by the tip of the blade. then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on the top of the bride's head. she lets out a howl, and falls to the floor, holding the lump on her noggin.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{i'm a hundred and fifty years old, and you can't even make me break a sweat.}
<A>__{he chops the sword in half with his hand.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{let's see your tiger and crane style match my eagles's claw.}
<A>__{again she attacks...again he eludes. like a gordon liu and lo lieh film, they do their animal style martial arts dance. as she strikes and he blocks...he yells out;}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{...pathetic.....terrible...you idiot, you should've landed that blow...you call that crane?... enough, i grow bored.}
<A>__{with little effort on his part, he reaches out and grabs her wrist, twists...she's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in the air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers. he could literally break her arm in half.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{i asked you to show me what you know, and you did. not a goddamn thing.}
<A>__{he twists her wrist... ...the pain is excruciating.....}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{like all yankee women, the only thing you know how to do is order in restaurants and spend a man's money.}
<A>__{he twists more... she cries out.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{excruciating isn't it? i asked you a question!}
<A>__{through gritted teeth, she answers;}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{i could chop off your arm at will. i think i shall.}
<A>__{he raises his other hand to chop off her arm. the bride screams in english;}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{no please don't!}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{if you wish to speak romantic languages, you've come to the wrong place.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{please don't cut my arm off!}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{it's my arm now. i can do with it what i please. if you can stop me, i suggest you try.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{i can't!}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{because you're helpless?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{have you ever felt this before?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{compared to me you're as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle, aren't you?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yes!!!}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{that's the begging!}
<A>__{he lets go of her wrist. she cradles her still throbbing arm.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{is it your wish to learn how to make others as helpless as you were?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{can you cook?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{pai mei}
<D>__{i will be the judge of that.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{draw me a bath...your training will begin tomorrow. that arm is still mine. you may lose it yet.}
