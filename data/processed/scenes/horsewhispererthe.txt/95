<L>__{exterior peterson's stables day}
<A>__{tom stands alone at the stable. opening the bottom door, ducking under the stall, he goes inside.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{okay now... okay now...}
<A>__{walking towards him, tom raises his hand, showing pilgrim a sign of respect, of trust... he quietly makes his way along pilgrim's side, along his flank, prompting pilgrim to move out from the shadows, into the light. tom moves to look at him. and pilgrim suddenly kicks out at him. tom, not cowed, stands his ground. he bends, looking at pilgrim's withered legs. he looks up at his scarred head. he looks into the pools of the horse's tortured eyes. pilgrim stands still allowing tom this brief intimacy. as grace walks towards the stable, she realizes that the door is open and tom must be inside. she is amazed. annie, appearing behind her, is also impressed. tom exits the stable and sees them, as he closes the doors.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well... you're closest anyone's gotten.}
<A>__{he walks straight towards them veering more to grace. he stops in front of her and they look into each other's eyes in a way that reminds us of how tom looked at pilgrim. except, grace is made even more uncomfortable by the intimacy. she turns away and walks to the corral, to lean on a post as if she doesn't care. tom turns to annie.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i have to be honest. i still feel you made a long trip for nothing.}
<A>__{he looks at annie. annie has no more words just an ever present pleading in her face. tom watches as grace makes a small, naked movement putting her hand on her cheek, like a hurt child. he can't help but see these three being connected by one wound.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{but before i even think about it, i need to know something here and now. it's a question for grace here.}
<A>__{grace stiffens.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{when i work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. it doesn't work that way. the owner needs to be involved too.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well, that'll be a little complicated }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. but she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am i right? so here's the deal. i'm not sure i can do anything, but i'm prepared to give it a go }
<P>__{(to grace)}
<D>__{ if you'll help.}
<P>__{(grace gives a bitter laugh)}
<D>__{you have a problem with that?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{isn't it like, obvious?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{not to me. either you want to or you don't.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{look, i will talk to grace and call you later }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. and i don't want to waste anybody's time mostly mine.}
<A>__{grace reacts anew to tom's remark. she likes her mother being dis empowered. annie keenly understands the importance of tom putting it this way to grace. grace has all eyes on her just what she wants. all waiting for her response. she turns away, flicks her head and says:}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{well, there's nothing else to do around here.}
<A>__{annie smiles in relief. but tom isn't satisfied.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{not good enough. i can't help you.}
<A>__{he starts walking away. annie doesn't know what to do. grace mumbles.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what do i have to do?}
<A>__{tom keeps walking out... grace says it louder.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i said, what do i have to do?!}
<A>__{tom stops and looks at her. annie holds her breath.}
