<L>__{interior car. day.}
<A>__{clyde is shaken. he speaks haltingly, panting; trying to get control of himself.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{damn him, that big son of a bitch... he tried to kill me... i ain't got eyes in back of my head... i didn't want to hurt him. it wasn't a real robbery... some food and a little bit of dough. i'm not against him. damn!}
<L>__{exterior speeding car. day.}
<A>__{the car is speeding down an open road. suddenly it begins to buck and cough. there is something wrong with the motor.}
<B>__{close shot. c.w. moss. exterior filling station.}
<A>__{his cherubic cheeks are puffed up as he blows into the fuel lines of clyde's car. there is a distinctly flat sound. reaction: clyde and bonnie. clyde stands by the hood. bonnie remains seated in the car. clyde is covered with sweat and grease clearly he has gotten in his licks on the engine without success. neither he nor bonnie seems impressed by the noise c.w. is making. another angle. c.w. as he screws back the fuel line and moves between bonnie and clyde to the ignition, turning the engine over. it purrs beautifully. clyde is astonished.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{what was wrong, anyway?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(moving back to screw on gas cap)}
<D>__{air bubble clogged the fuel line.}
<A>__{c.w. now stands between bonnie and clyde.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i just blowed her away.}
<A>__{clyde still can't get over it.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{you just blowed it away.}
<A>__{c.w. belches. he is embarrassed before bonnie.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{'scuse me, ma'm... anythin' else i can do for you?}
<A>__{clyde nods vigorously, looking across c.w.'s back to bonnie. bonnie gets the message.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{well...i'm not sure...}
<P>__{(she looks around)}
<D>__{say, them little red things there stickin' up? are they gas pumps?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(he's not too bright)}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{isn't that interesting? how does that there gasoline get in my little old car?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(trying to be helpful)}
<D>__{well, y'see, there's this tank underground, and the gas comes up this tube into the pump and into your car, m'am.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{my, you're a smart fellow. you sure know a lot about automobiles, don't you?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(he has no idea he's being toyed with)}
<D>__{yeah, i do.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{well, would you know what kind of a car this is?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(touching it)}
<D>__{yeah, it's a chevrolet 8 cylinder coupe.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{no, no.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{sure it is.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{no, this is a stolen chevrolet 8 cylinder coupe.}
<A>__{c.w. jerks his hand off it as if he touched a hot stove.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(getting in the conversation)}
<D>__{you ain't scared, are you?}
<P>__{(to bonnie)}
<D>__{i believe he is. what a pity. we sure coulda used a smart boy who knows such a great deal about automobiles.}
<P>__{(suddenly business like, to c.w.)}
<D>__{you a good driver, boy?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(getting quite confused)}
<D>__{i guess so.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(pretending to cool on him)}
<D>__{no, i don't think so. he's better off here...}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{what's your name, boy?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{c.w. moss.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{what's the c.w. for?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{clarence wallace.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{i'm miss bonnie parker and this is mr. clyde barrow. we... rob... banks.}
<P>__{(c.w. reacts with wide eyes)}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(swiftly, testing his mettle)}
<D>__{ain't nothing wrong with that, is there, boy?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{uh, nope }
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(with a put on sigh)}
<D>__{no, he ain't the one.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{unless, boy, you think you got enough guts for our line of work?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(affronted in his dumb way)}
<D>__{what do you mean? i served a year in the reform school.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{oh, a man with a record!}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{now look here, i know you got the nerve to short change old ladies who come in for gas, but what i'm askin' you is have you got what it takes to pull bank jobs with us?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{mr. c.w. moss?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(anxious to prove himself)}
<D>__{sure, i could. sure i could. i ain't scared, if that's what you think.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{prove it.}
<A>__{c.w. walks away from the car. camera remains where it was. we see him walk inside the gas station office, open the cash drawer, close it and come out. he emerges with a fistful of money. he walks over to bonnie's window, sticks his hand inside and drops the money on her lap. we see the bills flutter down. not a word is spoken. bonnie moves over into the middle. c.w. opens the door and gets in behind the wheel. for a moment we see them all sitting there, each smiling their little smile. clyde starts to hum a hillbilly tune quietly. the sound track picks it up (banjo and violin, etc.) and as the music swells, they drive off down the road.}
