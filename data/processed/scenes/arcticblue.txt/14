<A>__{in the passenger seat, mitchell (38), chews tobacco and looks grim. he's a squat, flat faced okie, with curly matted hair and tired grey eyes. he's dressed in a brown long coat and has a colt .45 peacemaker in a quick draw holster strapped to his leg. despite his intimidating air, confrontation is not his style. he spots a figure up ahead, where the road crosses a muddy creek.}
