<D>__{interior mary's apartment court day the sound of groaning. wretching. shooting through a half open door, we see mary hunched over her basin, vomiting. presently, she emerges from the bathroom. white faced. her hands instinctively covering her belly. mary's eyes widen with the implications. interior king's apartment day sir thomas boleyn and the duke of norfolk stare at mary. also present are several physicians and george boleyn..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{are you certain?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yes. sir thomas looks at the physician, who nods..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{in that case...i suppose...someone should tell the king. interior henry's apartment day shooting through a half open door.. sir thomas and the duke of norfolk are having a private audience with the king. sir thomas whispers something in henry's ear..}
<P>__{(we do not hear the words we do not need to).}
<D>__{henry's face breaks out in a smile. he delightedly shakes sir thomas's hand. over this: the sound of a voice..}
<C>__{sir thomas }
<D>__{keep them shut...still shut.. interior court accommodation day a blindfolded mary is led through doors by sir thomas..into a suite of grand, unfurnished rooms, the most prestigious accommodation at court..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{now open! mary removes her blindfold. she gasps in disbelief, turns 360 degrees, staring at the size, and grandeur of the location..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{there's more. thanks to you, i am to become an earl. your brother a viscount. eorge smiles at mary, who's eyes widen..}
<C>__{sir thomas }
<D>__{in addition, we have received a number of new grants and estates. pointedly, to lady}
<P>__{elizabeth)}
<D>__{so our debts are paid off. but lady elizabeth remains granite faced..}
<C>__{lady elizabeth}
<D>__{just be aware. these `gifts', this `favour' can go as swiftly as it comes. these rooms belonged to the duke of buckingham. once the king's closest friend. now his head rots on a spike..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{because he committed treason.}
<C>__{ady elizabeth}
<D>__{but what is `treason'? it's anything the king or his lawyers decide it to be. anything that offends him, or causes him displeasure.}
<P>__{a beat)}
<D>__{and can you assure me we'll never do that? lady elizabeth turns and walks out. mary looks anxiously at sir thomas, who gestures dismissively..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{pay her no heed.. interior mary's bedroom day mary wakes up. she gets out of bed. she goes to the window and draws the curtains. then mary looks down, and gasps. the floor has fresh drops of blood on it. mary goes to her bed, and rips back the sheets. her eyes widen in horror. there is blood all over the sheets. mary covers her mouth. lets out a loud cry. the sound of approaching footsteps as servants come running.. interior mary's apartment day mary lies on the bed being examined by several physicians. sir thomas and the duke of norfolk look on in concern. finally, the physician turns, washing his hands..}
<C>__{physician}
<D>__{happily, the baby lives. she's not miscarried. sir thomas's face. overcome with relief..}
<C>__{physician}
<D>__{but the placenta is weak. for the sake of the child.. the physician clears his throat. this will not be easy..}
<C>__{physician}
<D>__{she must begin her lying in immediately.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{what? mary looks up. her heart sinks.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{but i'm only three months.. interior mary's bedroom court day mary lies in her bed, watching with a forlorn expression as midwives and maids prepare the apartment for lying in. apestries with soothing biblical images are hung on the walls. curtains are drawn for darkness. a large crucifix is placed in a corner. as each tapestry is hung, the room becomes darker... ..and darker. ..and darker. mary cranes her neck to remain in sunlight for as long as possible, but before long.. ..her face slips into darkness, and the room into total silence. and effective imprisonment. interior mary's apartment day darkness. the king stands at the foot of mary's bed. he is clearly uncomfortable in these `maternal' surroundings..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you poor girl. all alone in here. but the time will fly by.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{will it? it's six months?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i know. but the most important thing is a healthy child. enry takes mary's hand..}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{i will come and see you as often as i can. i promise. henry kisses mary, then goes. interior court day the king's birthday. the master of revels has organised a lavish ball. the entire court is assembled and dancing, but henry appears sullen, distant. unable to celebrate. he misses mary. he queen has several of her prettiest spanish ladies in waiting surrounding the king. giggling, fragrant butterflies. but henry shows no interest. the duke of norfolk notices this. a flicker of concern. exterior gardens day an archery competition is in progress. but henry pays no attention. he sits listlessly to one side. ill tempered and missing mary. among the guests are sir john seymour and his children. they notice the king, all alone. they talk among themselves. sensing an opportunity, sir john seymour advances, and presents his pretty daughter jane to the king. the duke of norfolk, (never far away), notices how modestly and demurely young jane seymour flirts. she has been well trained. but she makes no impact on henry. he waves the seymours away. not remotely interested. for the moment. interior mary's room lying in evening the king is visiting mary. he sits by her bed. they hold hands and are talking intimately.}
