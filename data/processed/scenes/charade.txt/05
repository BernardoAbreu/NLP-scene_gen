<C>__{sylvie}
<D>__{but that is no reason to get a divorce!}
<L>__{exterior hotel terrace day}
<A>__{an open balcony running around two sides of the pool, sun worshippers lying in deck chairs. reggie and sylvie appear, their conversation continuing.}
<C>__{sylvie}
<D>__{with a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.}
<C>__{reggie}
<P>__{(sitting)}
<D>__{i admit i moved to paris because i was tired of american provincial, but that doesn't mean i'm ready for french traditional. i loathe the idea of divorce, sylvie, but if only charles had been honest with me that's all i ask of anybody the simple truth. but with him, everything is secrecy and lies. he's hiding something something frightening something terrible and evil.}
<A>__{she stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over her. she wheels, terrified. close shot peruvian snow mask a strange, grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the face except for eyes, nose and mouth. the eyes inside this particular mask stare down at reggie.}

<D>__{does this belong to you?}
<A>__{camera pans down to include jean louis, his hand held firmly by the man in the mask.}
<B>__{wider angle}

<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh, forgive me.}
<P>__{(indicating jean louis)}
<D>__{is this yours?}
<C>__{reggie}
<P>__{(indicating sylvie)}
