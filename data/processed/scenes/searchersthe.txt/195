<B>__{evening}
<A>__{laurie has reached the last page of the letter, reading it by the lamp on the table. jorgensen is knocking out the dead ashes of his pipe. charlie is in the shadows, a guitar in his hands not playing it, but occasionally softly picking a note or chord. mrs. jorgensen is dabbing moist eyes with a corner of her apron.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{...so we're setting out for new mexico territory in the morning... i am sorry i won't be back for christmas again this year...}
<A>__{she swallows hard, pauses a moment in her reading.}
<C>__{mrs. jorgensen}
<P>__{(quick sympathy)}
<D>__{and you knittin' that muffler...}
<C>__{laurie}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{what's the difference!}
<C>__{mrs. jorgensen}
<D>__{well, i just thought it would be a sin and a shame not to let someone get some good of it...}
<A>__{she looks almost too obviously at charlie, which annoys laurie. laurie resumes her letter reading:}
<C>__{laurie}
<P>__{(peering closely)}
<D>__{there's a word crossed out... it looks like 'i wish' or 'i will'...}
<P>__{(she gives up)}
<D>__{anyway... 'i set pen aside in the hope you are enjoying good health and your folks the same... i remain, respectfully...}
<P>__{(forlornly)}
<D>__{yours truly, martin paulie.'}
<A>__{that's all there is. not a cross on it. laurie just looks at it. jorgensen stands, pocketing his pipe, easing the crick in his back. he ceremoniously removes the spectacles and replaces them on the mantel.}
<C>__{jorgensen}
<D>__{they never find that girl.}
<C>__{laurie}
<P>__{(half to herself)}
<D>__{yours truly...}
<P>__{(hotly)}
<D>__{and he even has to write his full name... martin pauley... not even just martie!...}
<P>__{(she stands)}
<D>__{i don't care if he never comes back!}
<A>__{she heads for the front door.}
<C>__{mrs. jorgensen}
<P>__{(rising saying it without conviction)}
<D>__{now, laurie!...}
<A>__{charlie hits the guitar a little stronger. mrs. jorgensen looks at him and the matchmaker is at work.}
<C>__{mrs. jorgensen}
<D>__{charlie, you'll stay for supper?... now i won't take no for an answer.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{thought of saying 'no' never crossed my mind, miz jorgensen... no place i'd rather be than right here, right now.}
<A>__{mrs. jorgensen smiles and moves about her duties. laurie has opened the door and is staring out wistfully... and charlie begins playing and singing a verse from "skip to my lou."}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(singing)}
