<L>__{exterior two lane highway night}
<A>__{just outside town. joe and camille come down the highway at moderate speed. camille's hanging on for dear life, but we can tell she's enjoying it.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{this speed, o.k.?}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{yeh, fine.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{joe immediately accelerates, throwing camille's head back. her shriek is lost in the whine of the engine, as they speed away from camera.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{slow down, damnit. joe... joe!}
<A>__{they approach a high banked turn, beyond which appears to be a long, sheer dropoff. joe looks back at camille, smiles devilishly, not looking where he's going. camille sees they're heading straight for the edge.}
<C>__{camille}
<P>__{(freaked)}
<D>__{joe, look out!!!}
<A>__{too late. joe brakes, fishtails, but goes over the top of the bank, off the edge, flying out into oblivion, camille screaming.}
