<L>__{exterior paris streets night}
<A>__{louis and his platoon of young musketeers ride through the streets, scattering the paupers who sleep there.}
<L>__{interior bastille various shots night}
<A>__{back up the stairs... through one corridor... they start up the second flight of stairs, then stop and scramble back.}
<C>__{aramis}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{someone's coming!}
<A>__{they take cover on either side of the corridor, and lift their swords. it's a man coming down the stairs, with a hooded lantern... they raise their swords to strike }
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{d'artagnan!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{the way is blocked above. the captain of the bastille has turned back from the mission i sent him on, and is in the courtyard with a party of men.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{he lies. he is here to trap us.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i came to see you safely out. check for yourself.}
<A>__{porthos climbs the stairs to check; d'artagnan looks at phillippe, in the mask.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{all you have suffered, i would gladly have borne myself, to keep it from you.}
<A>__{athos spits on the floor, in derision. but porthos comes barreling back down the stairway.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{d'artagnan is right, the courtyard is filling with soldiers!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{this way.}
<A>__{he leads them quickly down a side corridor; the others have no choice but to follow.}
<B>__{a side corridor}
<A>__{d'artagnan leads them around another corner, into a long corridor; at the end of it is a massive door. they reach it, and d'artagnan produces a set of keys marked with the royal seal of the musketeers; he begins unlocking the three padlocks that secure the door.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{they will know you helped us, if we go this way.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{that doesn't matter now.}
<A>__{they open the door... and as they do they see louis and his platoon of young musketeers arriving outside.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{there! stop them!}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{betrayed!}
<A>__{the young musketeers serving the king jump from their horses and grab for the door; but d'artagnan leaps forward, his sword flashing. after a second of surprise, athos, aramis and porthos jump forward too, and there is a brief, bloody skirmish at the door. but the young musketeers have overwhelming numbers, and firearms too; protecting phillippe, the old musketeers draw back inside and succeed at pulling the door shut and latching it quickly.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{back the way we came!}
<A>__{they race back up the corridor the four musketeers, and phillippe, in the iron mask and turn the corner. they reach another inner door, pass through it and see the soldiers of the bastille coming at them.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{back!}
<A>__{they retreat, and porthos slams the second door. like all the inner doors of the bastille, it's heavy wood, a foot thick, and porthos seals it with a huger iron bar. but there's nowhere else to run.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{trapped.}
<A>__{at the far end of the corridor, the king's young musketeers have the same keys to the outer door that d'artagnan did, and they are breaking through. louis and two dozen of his personal bodyguard pour through the door.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{charge them!}
<A>__{the young musketeers obediently charge down the corridor. stepping up shoulder to shoulder aramis, d'artagnan, athos, porthos the four veteran musketeers meet the charge, first with pistols, then with swords, a wall between louis' men and phillippe. the battle in the cramped confines of the corridor is bloody and fierce; the young attackers can only get a few men into the fight at any one time, and those who step before the famous veterans are cut down. louis' young musketeers retreat, to regroup. at louis' end of the corridor louis is furious, jumping at lieutenant andre, who has dragged a wounded comrade back from the fight.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{cowards! twenty run from four?!}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{the corridor nullifies our number... and no one has stomach to fight the captain.}
<A>__{louis is disgusted by this loyalty and he has a solution.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{d'artagnan!}
<B>__{at the other end of the corridor}
<A>__{louis' voice echoes down to the veteran musketeers and phillippe, in the iron mask.}
<C>__{louis' voice}
<D>__{i am not angry with you. i knew you would lead me to them, and so you have! lay down your sword, and i will not punish you! i will let you retire in peace to live out your days in the countryside! and i will give your friends a swift execution, if you surrender now.}
<A>__{the words bounce down the long corridor; then silence. d'artagnan stands holding his sword, staring away from his friends, toward the king and his gang of young musketeers.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{d'artagnan. perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{he is right, d'artagnan.}
<A>__{athos says nothing; but when d'artagnan looks at him, he lowers his eyes in shame for ever having doubted d'artagnan's loyalty and friendship. phillippe speaks up, from behind the iron mask.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{wait. bargain me to louis, for all your lives. you have done your best. let me go, and let all of you find peace.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{no. even if i could give up my friends, i could never give up my son.}
<A>__{this hits them like a bombshell and suddenly it all makes sense; d'artagnan's loyalty to louis, his dogged hope that he could somehow influence him toward goodness. we see their stunned faces, each in turn: athos, aramis, porthos, and phillippe.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i never had any idea you existed... until they found you. and in all that time, i never had a moment's pride as a father until now.}
<A>__{d'artagnan and phillippe embrace, lost father to lost son. from the heavily barred door to their rear comes a powerful pounding; the bastille's soldiers are trying to break it down. time is running out. aramis looks back down the corridor toward the door to the outside, barred now by louis and his young guards, their long muskets bristling like spikes; and yet that way is the only possible hope for escape to the outside.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{d'artagnan... those are young musketeers down there. they have been weaned on our legends. they revere us it is an advantage. why don't we charge them?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i trained those men myself. they will stand and fight. but if we are to die, let it be this way.}
<A>__{he draws his sword and points it into the air. aramis lifts the tip of his sword to join that of d'artagnan. porthos does too... and then athos joins them.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{one for all. all for one.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{if i could have a blade, then i would be please to run with you.}
<A>__{d'artagnan gives phillippe a dagger. they look at each other. then d'artagnan begins to scream. the others take up the shout. then they step around the corner, and charge.}
<B>__{the last charge of the musketeers}
<A>__{we film it in all its glory, a visual feast: the last charge of the musketeers. their capes swirl about time, their hair flies, their legs take on new life. at first the young musketeers at the end of the corridor are frozen in surprise; their youthful lieutenant is awed by the dashing, beautiful bravery of the thing.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{magnificent valor...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{shoot them! shoot them!}
<A>__{louis grabs a musket from one of the reluctant soldiers and fires: sssboom! with the first explosion of gunfire the others pull their triggers; the powder in their weapons flashes and crashes... the musket balls fly down the hallway, sparking off the stone walls and floor, ricocheting, punching holes through the capes and flesh... but still the musketeers charge like the young men they once were still are, in spirit. in the confines of the bastille's stone corridor the noise is deafening, and the space in front of the guards is filled with the dense gray smoke of the gunpowder. none of them can see anything beyond it... and all is quiet.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{draw blades!}
<A>__{the king's guards draw their swords, and wait; are all the old musketeers dead? slowly the figures emerge from the smoke in slow motion, walking now, no need to run. all are wounded, but all are still alive. the four musketeers, along with phillippe, move slowly and steadily toward the blades of the young guards; a fight to the death? so be it. but the young lieutenant will have none of it; as one of his men lifts a sword to plunge it into the chest of d'artagnan, the young lieutenant bats the sword down, with his own.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{he steps forward toward d'artagnan; but instead of thrusting his sword he salutes with it. his men follow suit, saluting and bowing to the courage of these men they have grown up wanting to follow. king louis, for the moment, is frozen. d'artagnan looks back at phillippe; he has bullet holes in two different places at the edges of his clothes, but he is unwounded. then d'artagnan sees louis, with his long dagger, leaping at phillippe.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{d'artagnan throws himself between the two twins and hurls louis backwards, then spins to phillippe.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{phillippe!}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{i am unhurt }
<A>__{louis bounces off the wall and thrusts back again, driving the blade into d'artagnan's back. d'artagnan's face jolts; he staggers, his legs buckle. d'artagnan falls into the arms of his friends. louis stands holding his bloody dagger, everyone staring at him: d'artagnan, the old musketeers, the young ones.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{you! vicious... evil...!}
<A>__{he leaps into louis, overwhelming him in fury, wrenching the dagger from his brother's hand and gripping his throat.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{phillippe...! no... don't... he is your brother!}
<A>__{phillippe releases louis, who falls, choking, gasping. lieutenant andre is surprised by what he just heard.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{brother...?}
<A>__{phillippe darts to d'artagnan, being cradled by athos; athos lifts a hand from d'artagnan's back; it is drenched in blood. d'artagnan is dying. athos, aramis, porthos... none of them can speak. they grip d'artagnan, as if through their will alone they could keep his life from leaking away. the young musketeers stand transfixed, watching their legendary captain die. phillippe sags; his voice from behind the iron mask is torn by grief.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{all this time... i was a lost secret. but you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love. you were the man in the iron mask.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{d'artagnan...}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{shhh. all my life, this is the death i have wanted. to die among you. one for all... and all for...}
<A>__{he is gone. phillippe rises with a slow, terrible resolve, and moves to louis. when louis tries to rise to his feet he finds the blade of the young lieutenant andre pointed at his chest.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{all my life, all i ever wanted to be... was him.}
<A>__{he points to d'artagnan. phillippe rips away the key that dangles around louis' neck.}
