<A>__{logan heads for the gate. shook logan pops his claws. suddenly, the gate slowly opens inviting him to leave. he pauses, momentarily confused. he takes one long look back at the mansion. and then leaves. stay for a moment. watch him go. then pan across a sign which reads professor charles xavier's school for the gifted westchester n.y. panning slowly across the road to the thick woods on the other side of the street. something moves in the trees, catching our eye. someone is watching. it is toad, camouflaged amidst the trees and branches.}
