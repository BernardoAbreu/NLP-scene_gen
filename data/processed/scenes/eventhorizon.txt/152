<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior event horizon bridge}
<A>__{gravity has scattered debris and freeze dried blood about the room. the crew (justin and smith excepted) tries to relax on the chairs of dead men. their faces are wan and haggard. weir relaxes at the table. unlike the others, he seems almost at ease. dj remains forever stoic; starck, animated and nervous. cooper bounces the handball on the floor, a reflex action. miller stares at a video monitor, watching smith repair the lewis and clark. he turns from the window.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{okay, people, there's been a change in the mission. in less than eighteen hours, we will run out of breathable air. our primary objective is now survival. that means we focus on repairing the lewis and clark and salvaging whatever will buy us more time.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{our secondary objective is finding out what happened to this ship and its crew. two months from now, i fully intend to be standing in front of the good admiral giving my report, and i'd like to have more than my dick in my hands.}
<A>__{grim smiles all around.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{peters, i want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.}
<C>__{peters}
<D>__{i can use the station in medical, keep an eye on justin...}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{fine. starck, i want you to repeat the bio scan...}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{what's the point? i will just get the same thing...}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{not acceptable. i want to know what's causing those readings. if the crew is dead, i want the bodies, i want the crew found.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{i can reconfigure the scan for c 12, amylase proteins.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{do it. dr. weir...}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{one of my men is down. i want to know what happened to him.}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{i told you. he was inside the core...}
<A>__{weir starts shaking his head.}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{it was like... nothing was there... and then justin appeared and the core... became metal...}
<C>__{weir}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{no, he didn't.}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{you weren't there. i saw it.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{saw what, mr. cooper? what did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...}
<A>__{cooper throws the ball at him, hard. weir ducks. it bounces wildly around the room. miller catches it.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{cooper! enough!}
<A>__{cooper sits down.}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(turning on weir)}
<D>__{dr. weir, justin may die. whatever happened to him could happen to all of us.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{i don't know what happened to justin.}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{i'm telling you, i saw it...}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.}
<C>__{cooper}
<P>__{(turning on weir)}
<D>__{i know what i saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{it's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core, distorting space time. they could be what hit the lewis and clark.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{what could cause them?}
<P>__{(weir doesn't answer)}
<D>__{what's in the core?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{it's complicated...}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{how much time do you need? we have seventeen hours and forty two minutes. now: what is in the core?}
<A>__{beat. here comes another bomb...}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{a black hole.}
<A>__{the crew stares at him, stunned.}
