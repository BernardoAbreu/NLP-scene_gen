<B>__{the monitor}
<A>__{displays a digitized photo of the millard yearbook staff. dave novotny peers proudly from behind two of the taller students. a cursor in the shape of tiny scissors makes a small circle around dave's face. suddenly, the cursor turns into a tiny hand and drags dave's dislodged head into the trash. tracy concentrates as she deftly controls the mouse.}

<D>__{one of my duties was to clean up the group photos. it was a cinch with our new software.}
