<A>__{valentine's eyes burn into yuri.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(glancing to the open newspaper)}
<D>__{the reason i will be released is the same reason you think i will be convicted. i do rub shoulders with the most vile, sadistic men calling themselves leaders today.}

<D>__{but some of those men are the enemies of your enemies.}
<A>__{valentine is starting to get a sick feeling.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{and while the biggest arms dealer in the world is your boss, the president of the united states who ships more merchandise in a day than i do in a year sometimes it's embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns. sometimes he needs a freelancer like me to supply opposition forces he can't be seen supplying. you call me evil, but, unfortunately for you, i am a necessary evil.}

<A>__{valentine turns on his heel. he is at the door when yuri finally replies.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{what if i'm not? what if i sleep fine at night? what if i sleep better than you? i think that's what truly scares you.}
<A>__{valentine doesn't look back, exits. sure enough, the officer is in the hall as yuri predicted colonel southern.}
