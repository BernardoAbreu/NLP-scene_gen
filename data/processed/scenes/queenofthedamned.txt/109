<D>__{jesse!}
<B>__{angle on david talbot}
<A>__{as he pushes through the sea of white paint and plastic vampire teeth. but she has disappeared. talbot is jostled, dropping his glasses on the ground.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{sorry, grandpa!}
<A>__{talbot crouches down and finds his glasses. reemerging, he senses something and looks up. full shot marius watching him at a distance. next to the real thing, all these fake vampires look ridiculous.}

<D>__{hello, david.}
<B>__{on talbot}
<A>__{speechless.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{i must show you my new paintings sometime.}
<A>__{marius smiles. talbot is awestruck the goal of a lifetime's searching. he tries to say something, but it's too late. flash. marius is moving through the crowd at unnatural speed. enormous pipes spout flames high into the sky, run like a corridor of red light along the crowd, leading to two enormous egyptian effigies of akasha and enkil flanking a stage at the top end. and before the stage stretches a mass of human bacchanalian debauchery... woodstock on mescaline. naked bodies, pierced and tattooed, mingle with the strangest of fashions as crowds gather in circles around their own lit fires, drumming out awesome rhythms. the whole place is an enormous flaming mosh pit naked bodies walk across heads of people while others get tossed and thrown. this crowd is determined to get what they were promised... nothing like they've ever seen. a new world, a world of the initiated who have somehow managed to include themselves in the select number of attendees to a sacred rite. and among the mortals are the immortals. amidst them we see the tattooed vampires, the armani vampire, the others, now dressed in cloaks which they use to hide their knives and sickles.}

<A>__{standing on the strange rocks are the ancient vampires, except for maharet. some of whom can't help but smile at the scene below. marius is now with them.}

<D>__{it's just like nero's day.}
<A>__{they scan the horizon, the darkening sky.}
