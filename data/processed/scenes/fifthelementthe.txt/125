<D>__{really? maybe i can get you on my screen and see you at last!}
<A>__{zorg brings up a huge screen and pushes a few buttons. in the middle of an electronic snowstorm, a blackish, vaguely human, quiverinq form appears. two eyes, like lava, give an idea where the head is. zorg feels sick.}

<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{money is of no importance... i want the stones!}
<A>__{the black liquid oozes all over the screen which starts to melt. zorg sweats profusely, his legs tremble.}

<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{...i can't wait to be among you.}
