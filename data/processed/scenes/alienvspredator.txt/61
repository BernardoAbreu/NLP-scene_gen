<A>__{quinn's body lies near the tunnel entrance. he is covered in frost. looks like he never regained consciousness and has frozen to death. close on quinn as his eyes suddenly pop open. he's alive, but barely. his body temperature is incredibly low and his heart is barely beating. he can hardly move. suddenly the frost around his face begins to crack and melt as this once fearless man sweats with undeniable fear. quinn pov: three predators appear at the mouth of the grotto. they have descended the tunnel. they are headed straight toward him. quinn tries to struggle away from them, but he is frozen stiff. all he can do is watch helpless as the predators get closer and closer. predator vision: in their heat vision, the half frozen quinn is virtually invisible. they are blinded by the bright lights illuminating the pyramid. quinn is holding his breath. he can't believe it as the predators walk straight past him. so close that he could reach out and touch them. after a moment, quinn cranes his neck to see where the predators are going. he sees two shapes headed straight for the pyramid. just when quinn thought he was safe, he turns around and sees the third predator standing right over him. he was never fooled, only waiting for quinn to show himself. close on the twin blades as it scythes down toward quinn.}
