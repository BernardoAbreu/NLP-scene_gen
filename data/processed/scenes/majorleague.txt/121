<A>__{everything from here on will continue to be in slow motion. as duke whips his arm toward the plate, hayes takes off for third. taylor, instead of swinging away, shortens up on the bat and bunts duke's pitch down the third base line. the yankee third baseman, caught completely unaware, charges the ball frantically.}
