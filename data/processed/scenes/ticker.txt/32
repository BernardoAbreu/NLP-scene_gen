<L>__{interior machine shop afternoon}
<A>__{nearly pitch dark inside, shafts of late afternoon sunlight glistens on the battered machines. shadows wash over reilly and glass as they retrace the path reilly and rice took the night before, glass searching intensely, reilly getting more and more uncomfortable.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{so what were they doing here?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{i don't know. you tell me?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{an abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. low rent, too. but, you and rice ruined their perfect hideout.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{you mentioned something called redstone.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{redstone's the army training center in alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{cream of the crop, huh? you?}
<C>__{glass}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{top of my class at west point, thank you very much. then off to redstone. first half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{sounds like terrorist heaven.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{there were a few guys in my class with names like john smith, bill jones. i'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. c.i.a. funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{just how easy is it to build a... device?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{with a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. heck, didn't you ever watch macgyver?}
<A>__{reilly looks at glass strangely until he realizes they've stopped where rice died.}
<C>__{glass }
<D>__{so this is where it happened.}
<A>__{reilly fights the memory... eyes well up, his hand trembles ever so slightly as he points out...}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{girl was here. the guy in charge was over there with one of his men, the other one was back there.}
<A>__{glass gets down on his hands and knees, scans the floor. reilly talks to distract himself.}
<C>__{reilly }
<D>__{bombers, what kettle of fish are they?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. they like scaring people. that's why they call in their threats. same mentality as obscene phone callers.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{no, ninety ninety percent of them are full of baloney. they're into the power trip, not the damage. what scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. the worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.}
<A>__{glass lays out flat on his stomach and searches deep under a machine, picks up a half smoked cigarette butt with tweezers, pulls it out, kneels.}
<C>__{glass }
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{glass straightens it out, reads the brand name, "gallois".}
<C>__{glass }
<D>__{french. doubt somebody who worked here smoked it. only half gone, put it out in a hurry.}
<P>__{(glances around)}
<C>__{glass }
<D>__{figuring the length, assuming it was one of these guys, odds are... it was lit outside.}
<A>__{glass takes off. reilly follows.}
