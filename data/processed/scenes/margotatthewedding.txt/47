<A>__{pauline walks back to the house, buttoning her dress. she looks up suddenly and stops: a man watches her from the lawn. he holds a bouquet of flowers. pauline runs to him.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{jim...}
<A>__{they embrace. her hand cups the back of his neck.}
<C>__{claude }

<L>__{exterior patio late day}
<A>__{pauline, malcolm, margot, jim, claude and ingrid eat fish stew and peasant bread. jim's flowers sit in a vase. he wears a tan knit bracelet that ingrid made.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{it was a difficult decision because claude has so many friends at school now, but it is expensive and bronx science is a great public school.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i didn't get into stuyvesant.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{he's not a good test taker.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i went to stuy.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(caught off guard)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i'd rather stay at packer, but it's so expensive.}
<A>__{malcolm lifts up a bottle of jameson from the floor near his chair and pours himself another stiff drink.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{josh is a great test taker, but claude thinks more abstractly. he's more creative. right?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i guess so.}
<A>__{jim smiles warmly at his son.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i saw the one armed man who really has two arms at the bodega.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{did you give him confusing change?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i did. i tripped him up with some nickels. and a canadian quarter.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you know what i tried the other day? sitting down to pee. have you done this, jim?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no...no.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i did it as a lark. as a joke really. i was going to call pauline in and say, guess what i'm doing here...}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i'm sorry i didn't get to have that experience.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i was thinking, you know, my dad used to say, "why stand when you can sit." and this is a really good example of that. i mean, it took me so long to try because i was embarrassed.}
<P>__{(to the sisters)}
<D>__{you guys do it all the time.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i never sit down in a public place. i squat and hover.}
<A>__{ingrid goes wide eyed for a moment.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{anyway, i recommend it. at least to try it.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{jim, i'm sorry about the room. it's usually malcolm's storage room so it's kind of make shift right now.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{it's fine.}
<A>__{margot stares at jim.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{margot, open your gift.}
<A>__{an unopened present in blue tissue paper sits beside margot's plate.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i get self conscious opening presents in front of people. this weekend is about pauline.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{oh...poo. open it margot.}
<A>__{margot slowly unties the white ribbon and peels away the tape. pauline groans:}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{come on, get to it.}
<A>__{margot takes out a pair of furry slippers.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{those look warm.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i remember last year in vermont you said your feet were freezing.}
<A>__{her eyes find claude who watches his parents carefully. she leans across the table to jim and they kiss chastely and briskly on the lips.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{thank you.}
