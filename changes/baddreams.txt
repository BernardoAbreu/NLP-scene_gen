<ACTION>__{A serene landscape, mist collecting as the red ball of a sun dips behind the mountains. In the middle of a field stands a bare-chested man facing the sunset. He is HARRIS, forty-ish, greying but handsome, and very fit. His hands are outstretched as if embracing an invisible entity. He seems filled with some sort of transcendental power. Now, an air of fulfillment and resolve settles over him. He turns and walks away from us. CAMERA ADJUSTS and reveals--}
<LOC>__{EXT. UNITY HOUSE - LONG SHOT - SUNSET}
<ACTION>__{Once the home of Victorian Gentry, a few seasons of amateur repair work have not compensated for decades of neglect. But now as Harris walks towards it, the fading daylight and long shadows turn it into a fantasy castle. MUSIC ECHOES faintly from within; it's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" by Iron Butterfly. If the music didn't place the era for us, the battered VW MINIBUS parked outside the house does; it's covered with flower paintings, slogans, and the ubiquitous peace sign. As Harris approaches the house, a dozen or so YOUNG PEOPLE rush to greet him and embrace him. Extending his arms out to enclose them all, he goes inside.}
<LOC>__{INT. COMMON ROOM - SUNSET}
<ACTION>__{This was probably a stately parlor in its day. There is a funky assembly of odd handmade furniture. There are muslin curtains on the windows, crude paintings, and quilts covering ripped chairs and couches. Despite the squalor, there is a neatness to the place. Now, the CAMERA begins to ROAM through the room and down the hallways lined with fading wallpaper.}

A HAND reaches in and opens the door, and inside we SEE cartons, antique toys... and then CYNTHIA, a pretty 13 year old girl who wears funky clothing and a haunted, nervous expression.}

<ACTION>__{The VOICES stop as everyone awaits an answer. CAMERA PANS across the common room, to the end we haven't seen yet. In the center of the room is a big cistern or font. As we watch, Harris has just DUNKED someone in it. The person steps out, laughing, sloshing in amber liquid. Standing around are other people, some already dripping wet, others awaiting their turns. Some are clothed and wet, others in varying degrees of undress. It all seems slightly off, slightly eerie, despite their smiles and cheer. Harris splashes himself with the amber liquid from the tub, pushes his hair back.}
