<L>__{interior the changing room}
<A>__{they enter the wood panelled changing room next to the hamilton pool. there are two swimsuits hanging from wooden pegs.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{pick a suit.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{i don't know. it's getting pretty late...}
<A>__{she locks the door to the changing room and begins to walk towards mike damone.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{are you really a virgin?}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{come on...}
<A>__{he could feel his leg starting to shake the slightest bit.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{it's okay if it's your first time.}
<A>__{she gives him a kiss.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{listen. i feel pretty strange here. because mark really likes you, and he's my friend.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{he's my friend, too.}
<A>__{she gives him another kiss. he kisses her in return. standing there, feeling stacy in her bikini, feeling her kiss him, damone also felt some of his reservations slip away.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{you're a really good kisser.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{so are you.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{are you shaking?}
<C>__{damone}
<P>__{(shaking)}
<D>__{no. are you crazy?}
<A>__{it is clear that this is as far as mr. attitude has ever gotten with a girl. stacy takes the initiative, rubbing her hands through his hair, rubbing his sides, kissing his neck, then pulling away.}
<C>__{stacy}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{why don't you take off your clothes, mike?}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{you first.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{how about both of us at the same time?}
<A>__{damone nods, and watches as stacy unhooks her top and steps out of her bikini bottom. she stands naked in the shadows of the afternoon sun. she sits down naked on a red changing room couch, and gathers her legs up to her chest. she watches as damone struggles with his clothes.}
<B>__{angle on damone}
<A>__{hopping on one leg, pulling first out of his pants, then his jockey underwear. bashfully, he goes to sit next to stacy on the couch. they begin to kiss, and it quickly escalates into heavy petting. stacy pulls away.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{i want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{let's continue.}
<A>__{stacy leans back and pulls him on top of her. he enters her and begins pumping so hard, so fast, that he doesn't notice he's banging the sofa into the wall of the changing room. but just as quickly as damone starts, he stops.}
<C>__{stacy}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{hey, mike?}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{what? are you all right?}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{i think we're making a lot of noise.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm really sorry.}
<A>__{he has a strange look on his face.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{i think i came. didn't you feel it?}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{i guess i did.}
<A>__{they lay there, damone still on top of her on the red couch.}
<B>__{angle on damone}
<A>__{as we read the confusion on his face. he is embarrassed, a little confused... mostly he just wants to be alone.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{i've got to get home. i've really got to go, stacy.}
<B>__{angle on stacy}
<A>__{as she looks up at him. she gives him a kiss. damone gets up puts his pants and shirt on. he leaves the changing room.}
