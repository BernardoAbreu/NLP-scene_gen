<C>__{lorraine}
<D>__{i can still hear that voice.}
<A>__{she looks up at josh and screams! over josh's shoulder, crouched down behind the couch and peeking up over the armrest at lorraine, is a diabolical figure. his face is pure red with smeared lipstick. his scalp is completely bald, yet tufts of hair dangle above his ears. other than his face, his skin is charcoal black. lorraine recoils back, utterly petrified.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{lorraine stares eerily into his eyes. frozen.}
<C>__{lorraine}
<D>__{he's here.}
<A>__{renai looks to josh, who is at a total loss. she is crying.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{help us...}
<A>__{his anger fades and he steps over and takes her in his arms.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{i don't know how.}
<C>__{lorraine}
<D>__{i know somebody who can help...if you're willing to ask for it.}
