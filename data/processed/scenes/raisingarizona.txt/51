<B>__{two shot}
<A>__{evelle is screaming at the top of his lungs as the car rocks to a stop. he peers through the windshield, still screaming, but nothing has shot off the roof of the car. he cranes his neck to look up the slant of the windshield toward the roof. this of course gives him no view; still screaming, he thrusts his body out his open window to look up at the roof. his scream is muted as his head disappears from view, then comes back full force as he ducks back in, frantically shaking his head. with this gale's last hope disappears and he starts bellowing also. gale's foot rising from the brake to plunge down on the accelerator.}
