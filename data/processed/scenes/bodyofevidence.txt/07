<L>__{interior cardenas' office day}
<A>__{spacious and sparsely furnished. the walls are empty. no commendations, plaques or photographs to add prestige to the office. cardenas steps into the room and looks at mccurdy who is already seated next to reese and troxell.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<P>__{(to mccurdy)}
<D>__{what are you saying, henry? that his girlfriend fucked him to death?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{a trace of a grin shows on cardenas' face. he walks over to the window and stares outside. reese, troxell and mccurdy wait as he thinks. a beat. cardenas turns back to the room.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what can we prove?}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{we know marsh had a head cold. we found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand. the coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time. he'd keep using more and more never knowing what he was taking.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{any prints on the nasal spray?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{marsh's and rebecca lawson's.}
<C>__{troxell}
<D>__{what if he did know what was in it? a lot of users put it in nasal spray bottles so they can use it in public.}
<C>__{mccurdy}
<D>__{cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{can we put rebecca lawson at the scene?}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{a man across the street from marsh saw her drive up about four thirty sunday afternoon. and her prints are all over the place.}
<A>__{cardenas stands and walks to a dart board on the wall. he gathers the darts, moves back and tosses one.}
<C>__{troxell}
<D>__{marsh's cardiologist told me that after marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day. does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what did he say about miss lawson?}
<C>__{troxell}
<D>__{he can remember at least one occasion and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied marsh to the office.}
<A>__{cardenas throws another dart at the board.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{so she knew about his heart?}
<C>__{troxell}
<D>__{had to. i also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with marsh. there's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting miss lawson.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what about the will?}
<C>__{troxell}
<D>__{that's the best part. she gets it all everything.}
