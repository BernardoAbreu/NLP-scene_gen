<T>__{slam cut to:}
<L>__{exterior ice palace day}
<A>__{marshmallow holds anna and kristoff by the scruff of their necks in one hand and olaf in the other.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{stop. put us down!}
<C>__{olaf}
<P>__{(to marshmallow)}
<D>__{you are a lot stronger than i think you realize.}
<A>__{marshmallow tosses kristoff and anna down the steps.}
<C>__{marshmallow}
<P>__{(like a bouncer)}
<D>__{go away!}
<A>__{anna and kistoff slide past sven, who's got his tongue stuck to the ice railing.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{heads up!}
<A>__{olaf's head smashes into a snowbank nearby.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{olaf!}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{watch out for my butt!}
<A>__{anna and kristoff duck as the rest of olaf slams into the snowbank. marshmallow turns to go back into the castle. incensed, anna tries to march back up the stairs.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it is not nice to throw people!}
<A>__{kristoff grabs her, pulls her back.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{all right feisty pants. calm down. woaw. just let the snow man be.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{let me at him. i want to get him. i.... okay. i'm calm.}
<A>__{anna backs down...for a moment. then she grabs a snowball and throws it at marshmallow. the tiny little ball hits marshmallow's back, not making even the slightest dent. but it's enough to infuriate him. he roars. spikes shoot out of his joints.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{uh oh. now you made him mad!}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{...i will distract him. you guys go.}
<A>__{kristoff pushes anna along. sven runs off in the opposite direction. olaf's belly and butt fall and follow sven.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{no, no, not you guys.}
<A>__{marshmallow goes charging after anna and kristoff as olaf's head falls and lands face down in snow.}
<C>__{olaf }
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{this just got a whole lot harder.}
<A>__{anna and kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope. they tumble to a stop at the bottom just as marshmallow lands hard right behind them. they're off again...through a maze of conifers that sag under the weight of the snow, marshmallow hot on their trail.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{this way!}
<A>__{anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of the snow. the tree snaps upright, knocking marshmallow back.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{ho ho ho!}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i got him!}
<A>__{anna and kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost run right off a cliff. they stop short, toes on the edge.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{whoa, stop!}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's a hundred foot drop.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{it's two hundred.}
<A>__{kristoff ties the rope around anna and pulls tight.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ow.}
<A>__{he drops to his knees and starts digging a u shape in the snow with a pick axe.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{what's that for?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{i'm digging a snow anchor.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(not trusting)}
<D>__{okay. what if we fall?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{there's twenty feet of fresh powder down there; it'll be like landing on a pillow.... hopefully.}
<A>__{they hear an angry roar coming closer.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{okay, anna. on three.}
<A>__{anna preps for the jump like a boxer getting ready to fight.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{okay. you tell me when...}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{one...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{...i'm ready to go....}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{two...}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(pumped up)}
<D>__{...i was born ready! yes!}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{calm down.}
<A>__{a huge tree flies through the air toward them.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{tree!}
<A>__{anna jumps and pulls kristoff over the edge with her. they hang upside down over the cliff by the rope. the rope catches their fall.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{whoa! that happened.}
<A>__{back up top, olaf emerges from the woods. he's a complete mess, all his body parts are in the wrong places. he huffs and puffs, struggling to run.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{ah. ah. man, am i out of shape.}
<A>__{he stops. puts his body back together in the right order.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{there we go. hey, anna! sven! where'd ya guys go? we totally lost marshmallow back there!}
<A>__{marshmallow steps up behind olaf. olaf turns to face him.}
<C>__{olaf }
<P>__{(happily)}
<D>__{hey. we were just talking about you. all good things, all good things.}
<A>__{marshmallow roars and approaches kristoff's snow anchor.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{olaf jumps onto marshmallow's leg trying to stop him, but not making much of a difference.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{this is not making much of a difference!}
<A>__{marshmallow flicks olaf off his leg and right over the cliff.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{whoa!}
<A>__{olaf passes anna and kristoff.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{olaf!}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{hang in there, guys!}
<A>__{marshmallow starts yanking kristoff and anna's rope up.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{wait, what?}
<A>__{kristoff's head hits the cliff.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{aargghh!}
<A>__{kristoff passes out and hangs like a rag doll.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{kristoff!}
<A>__{marshmallow pulls them up. he roars and breathes snow all over them.}
<C>__{marshmallow}
<D>__{don't come back!}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(grossed out by his snow breath)}
<D>__{ugh. we won't.}
<A>__{anna whips out a knife and cuts the rope. kristoff comes to just as they fall. they both scream! slam! reveal: anna opens her eyes to find herself buried up to her shoulders in the soft thick snow. she laughs.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{hey, you were right. just like a pillow.}
<A>__{she looks up to see olaf's upper half hanging onto kristoff's boots, which are sticking out of the snow.}
<C>__{olaf}
<P>__{(shaking the boots)}
<D>__{i can't feel my legs! i can't feel my legs!}
<A>__{suddenly, kristoff's head pops up. he spits out snow.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{those are my legs.}
<A>__{olaf's bottom goes running by.}
<C>__{olaf}
<P>__{(to kristoff)}
<D>__{ooh. hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.}
<A>__{kristoff grabs olaf's head and puts it on his body.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{oh, that feels better.}
<A>__{sven walks up and sniffs olaf's nose.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{hey, sven!}
<A>__{olaf turns to anna and kristoff just as sven goes to bite off his nose and misses.}
<C>__{olaf }
<D>__{he found us.}
<P>__{(to sven, funny voice)}
<D>__{who's my cute little reindeer?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{don't talk to him like that.}
<A>__{kristoff goes over to help anna, who is stuck in the snow.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{he lifts her out easily.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{whoa!}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{they meet eyes. wait. is that chemistry?}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{...um.... how's your head?}
<A>__{she touches the spot where he banged his head.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<P>__{(in pain)}
<D>__{ah! ooh!}
<A>__{he catches himself. waves off the pain with a giggle.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<D>__{i mean, it's fine. ah...i'm good. ha. i've got a thick skull.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{i don't have a skull.... or bones.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{...so....}
<A>__{the awkwardness is killing him.}
<C>__{kristoff }
<P>__{(shy)}
<D>__{now what?}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(shy)}
<D>__{now what?}
<P>__{(then...panicking)}
<D>__{now what?! oh! what am i gonna do? she threw me out. i can't go back to arendelle with the weather like this. and then there's your ice business }
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{hey, hey, don't worry about my ice business...}
<P>__{(noticing something)}
<D>__{worry about your hair?!}
<A>__{she thinks he means it looks bad. she smooths it down.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what? i just fell off a cliff. you should see your hair.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{no, yours is turning white.}
<A>__{she grabs her braid as a tendril turns white.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{white? it's what?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{it's because she struck you; isn't it?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{does it look bad?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{...no.}
<A>__{olaf's head pops up. he's holding his head up off his body to join the conversation.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{you hesitated.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{no, i didn't. anna, you need help. now, come on.}
<A>__{he heads towards the sunset. sven and olaf follow.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{okay! where are we going?}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{to see my friends.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(catching up)}
<D>__{the love experts?}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{love experts?!}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{yes. and don't worry; they'll be able to fix this.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<A>__{he looks her over, remembering the moment he saw the trolls heal her as a child.}
<C>__{kristoff}
<D>__{...because i've seen them do it before.}
<A>__{as they round the bend, the sun sets and olaf turns to sven.}
<C>__{olaf}
<D>__{i like to consider myself a love expert.}
