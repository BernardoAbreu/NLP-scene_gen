<L>__{interior subway. dawn.}
<A>__{brandon sits, looking over at the pretty subway girl sitting opposite the train moves on, after a while stopping at another platform. people get on, people get off. brandon's eyes travel down over the pretty subway girl's legs and up she opens them a little, the dip of her skirt, sinking deep between her thighs she looks up, senses brandon watching. she lets her fingers fall in her lap. brandon shifts a little in his seat to get a better look through the crowd. suddenly she stands and makes her way to the train door. hand reaching out and clenching a metal pole for stability, revealing a wedding ring. brandon's hand reaches for the pole too, touching her as he stands behind her. there is a gentle unison contact. brandon's breath, heavy on her neck. both are frozen to the spot, caught in a mutual moment.}
