<A>__{the lights are still on, grace has fallen asleep on her bed, still in her clothes, paperwork everywhere. case photos now fill the picture frames, cover the walls, even on the ceiling. knocking at the door. grace stirs. crosses to the door, groggy. she checks the peephole. cracks the door. it's inspector laval.}

<D>__{you're everywhere. what's up, laval?}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{a man was killed tonight. attacked from behind. asphyxiated with a nylon cord with handles. and there's a witness. or a suspect. we're not sure yet. we should go.}
