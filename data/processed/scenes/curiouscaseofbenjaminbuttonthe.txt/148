<L>__{exterior tugboat, atlantic ocean night, 1942}
<A>__{captain mike stands by the wheelhouse... silently looking at the ocean... they see bodies of men, dead men, floating by them... one and two at first... then three and four... and then more and more until they are moving through a carpet of bodies...}
<C>__{benjamin button's }
<D>__{the war found us.}
<A>__{as they move through the water... their propeller literally chopping up bodies, to where they have to veritably shut their engines down...}
<D>__{benjamin button's (v.0.) (cont'd) a transport carrying 900 men had been hit by a torpedo. we were first to arrive at the scene...}
<A>__{and as the tug arrives at the scene we see a transport vessel, with a gaping hole in its midships sinking quickly... fuel oil burning on the water... it's then we see the true horror of the men in the water... in the burning black oil... the transport boat silently slips into the water, disappearing under the sea...}
