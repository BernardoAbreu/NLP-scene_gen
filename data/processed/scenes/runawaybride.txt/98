<L>__{interior ike's car later that day}
<A>__{ike drives through hale gobbling french fries from the fast food bag in his lap. ike passes the inn hale bar, same dump of a tavern he talked to bartender at. angle on: maggie's car parked a few cars down. he pulls over and parks. he gets out and speaks into his tape recorder.}
<L>__{interior exterior the inn hale bar day}
<A>__{ike approaches the window of the bar. there's a drunk man and a dog sitting outside. inside, we see two figures from the back, arms around each other. one is definitely maggie. the other is definitely not bob.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(coaxing)}
<A>__{c'mon. let's go. as maggie helps the man get up, we see that it's walter, maggie's father dead drunk.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(belligerently)}
<A>__{i haven't had any fun since you got your driver's license... they stumble and lurch, exiting the bar toward maggie's car.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i'm not exactly having fun, either... steady.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(to dog)}
<A>__{good boy, port hole.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{his name is skipper, dad... steady.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i changed it.}
<P>__{(then to drunk)}
<A>__{see you later, mr. travis.}
<P>__{(then to maggie)}
<A>__{that guy has a problem... maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own. maggie's having trouble keeping him steady as she opens the car door. ike is there in a flash to help her pull walter into the car.}
<C>__{walter }
<A>__{good daughters let their fathers pass out. walter passes out on the front seat.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(without difficulty)}
<A>__{ike... please don't write anything about this }
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{no. forget about it. don't even think about it. maggie looks at him with real gratitude. she swings the car door shut.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{watch your leg, dad.}
<P>__{(then to ike)}
<A>__{i'm so tired of this.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. i will take you for a ride. then we'll come back for him.}
<P>__{(to drunk on bench)}
<A>__{keep an eye on him.}
<C>__{drunk man}
<A>__{i'm too loaded.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i was talking to the dog.}
<P>__{(turning to maggie)}
<A>__{all right? maggie thinks about this for a moment. she takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{okay... i will just grab my jacket.}
