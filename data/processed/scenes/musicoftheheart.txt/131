<L>__{interior roberta's brownstone night}
<A>__{the fiddlefest kids are crammed into roberta's house, (including de sean, guadalupe, ramon, vanessa, shandra, carlos, thomas, stephanie, amanda, kenny, and simon), rehearsing "orange blossom special." they play badly. rachel helps roberta correct students.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{stop! someone's playing the wrong notes! and you shouldn't need your music anymore! except for the bach double, everything has to be memorized by next rehearsal!}
<A>__{the kids look at each other, daunted.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{and you sound like you're sleepwalking. your heart's not even in it.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{maybe 'cause we don't have a place for the concert.}
<A>__{roberta looks at her, and then notices the despondent looks on many of the kids' faces.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{well, you're right. this might all be for nothing. so we can either keep on rehearsing in case we find a place or we can just... give up.}
<C>__{de sean}
<D>__{am i hearing right? did you use the words "give up"?}
<P>__{(to the students)}
<D>__{let's take a vote. how many of you want to give up?}
<A>__{no one raises a hand. roberta takes this in.}
<C>__{guadalupe}
<D>__{see? you taught us well.}
