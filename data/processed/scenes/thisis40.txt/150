<L>__{interior hospital night}
<A>__{debbie and larry sit in the waiting area of the hospital.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i guess the party didn't turn out like you planned.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{it wasn't a good party.}
<A>__{a nurse walks over to them.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{hi. i will bring you in as soon as his x rays are finished.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{is he okay?}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{yeah, he has a broken rib and he's been crying a little bit, but he'll be fine.}
<A>__{the nurse walks away.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you know pete was never a real fighter. but that's why he married you. that's why he loves you. because you're the fighter, and you need that. one person in a relationship has got to punch.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{do you mean that in a good way?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{oh, it's a high compliment.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{listen, i know what you're worried about. you think he's going to turn into me, but i don't think it's going to happen. he's smarter and probably a little cuter. a little less jewy. although, after fifty, that's all going to change. be prepared to wake up one day with a a rabbi. but the good news is, he'll love you forever. that's in our dna. we stick around.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{he worries about you. it puts a lot of pressure on him.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i know. i just don't have anyone else to talk to about it.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you can talk to claire.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{no. if i open up to her she'll leave me.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{no, she won't, larry, she loves you.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i know, but there's a certain point at which you just can't stay.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i guess it's hard to forgive somebody if they don't formally apologize to you.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{are you apologizing?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i'm very close.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yes, i'm sorry. and i'm glad everybody's okay.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{she hugs him and starts to cry a little bit.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i'm off.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{this is awkward.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i need forty dollars for a cab.}
<C>__{debbie}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{that's funny.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{no, i'm not kidding. you drove me. i wasn't prepared.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i only have a hundred.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{that's okay. i will bring you the change.}
<A>__{he grabs the bill out of her purse and walks off.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{all right, give him a kiss for me.}
