<L>__{interior rollo linsky's laboratory afternoon}
<A>__{next to a shallow porcelain tray full of immense and grotesque marine worm specimens lies a large parcel wrapped in brown paper. rollo's plump fingers eagerly open the package to reveal a large variety of delicatessen sandwiches and accessories. rollo offers some to st. luc while stuffing one in his own mouth. there are cokes and old coffees everywhere, plus mustard, relish, and ketchup dispensers of all kinds. rollo and st. luc sit around rollo's desk, a very sleek metal affair. rollo's lab itself is a combination of modern office and biology room in a museum of natural history. specimens of all kinds, in bottles and cases, mounted on glass and wood, floating in preservative baths, are everywhere. there are also a few cages of living insects, moldy aquaria and lab cultures in various stages of neglect. there are also clippings from magazines and newspapers sporting furious underlinings and circlings in red ink which are stuck to walls, doors, bookshelves. despite the potential for chaos, however, there is an underlying order which reflects rollo's own real discipline, which is not always immediately apparent. and the microscopes and glass slides, the stainless steel gynecological table complete with stirrups, metal drug and instrument cabinet, etc., are spotless and in good shape. rollo is rotund, soft faced, and a manic depressive. in his manic phase he is a joker and an elbow nudger, and his general style, even when discussing medical matters in medical jargon, is broad north american jewish. in his depressive phase, he becomes a sullen kid who has an oddly sinister aspect to his character. rollo detaches himself from his baby beef in order to comment on the food that, not so secretly, he loves best of all.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{not exactly the kind of lunch hobbes would have laid on you, rog, but it's all i got, and...}
<P>__{(places hand on heart,}
<D>__{leans over}
<P>__{confidentially)}
<D>__{...all i got i share with you. go ahead. take all you want.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{you touch my spleen, rollo.}
<P>__{(they giggle at an}
<D>__{old medical school}
<P>__{reference)}
<D>__{and here all the time i was thinking if i ever bothered to think about the good old days well, at least there's rollo. he's in vd and he's happy.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{i'm still a vd man under the skin, rog. you know me. i'm a down to earth kinda guy, right?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{well, at least you still talk the same.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{so who changes?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{but you gave up your private practice. suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{that was my father's idea... private practice. he wanted to set me up i couldn't say no. but he's dead now. and me, i'm still a snoop, i gotta do research. look at that beautiful stuff...}
<P>__{(gestures everywhere)}
<D>__{...lookit it!}
<A>__{he jams a final piece of sandwich into his mouth and jumps to his feet, smiling broadly.}
<C>__{rollo}
<P>__{(with great enthusiasm,}
<D>__{indicating the entire}
<P>__{lab)}
<D>__{this is the 'satyr's tongue'!}
<A>__{he pulls a book off a shelf with a bookmark in it. he opens the book at the marked page and hands it to st. luc. as st. luc looks at the picture of a satyr with his tongue hanging out and reads the brief note on how medieval alchemists thought the ground up tongue of the satyr could cure any disease, rollo continues to talk.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{the note includes a warning against swallowing the tongue whole, but we don't see the rest of this caution. 'satyr's tongue' was hobbes's code name for our project. what we were trying to do was to find an alternative to organ transplants.}
<A>__{as rollo speaks, he walks all over the place, picking up and discarding various charts, specimens, bottled and diseased human organs, etc. as he moves around, we catch glimpses of letrasetted signs that rollo has tacked up: 'sex is the invention of a clever venereal disease hobbes'; 'dr. hobbes's prescription: starve a fever, feed an obsession'; 'the road of excess leads to knowledge'; plus several pictures of satyrs with their tongues sticking out, being cut off by alchemists, etc.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{i know. you're bored already. transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<P>__{(shaking his head in protest)}
<D>__{did i say anything?}
<C>__{rollo}
<P>__{(excited, waving}
<D>__{specimens of parasites and diseased organs}
<P>__{around)}
<D>__{look. you got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. now. why not breed a parasite that does something useful? eh? why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? if it takes a little blood for itself, so what? be generous! you can afford it.}
<A>__{he is now in full flight. he leans over st. luc and begins to demonstrate what he says by drawing things on st. luc's stomach with his fingers. st. luc can't hide his amusement.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{you put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. i know what you're gonna say. you're gonna say it's crazy.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{it's crazy.}
<A>__{rollo throws himself back into his chair and grabs a pickle.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{right. it's crazy. but here's the beauty part. ready?}
<P>__{(leans forward for emphasis)}
<D>__{who cares?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{you know and i know that hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? lousy. dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. but he was always a genius at one thing getting grants. could he get grants for crazy projects?}
<A>__{st. luc is about to say something, but rollo answers his own rhetorical question with a flip of the hand, effectively silencing st. luc.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{you know who pays the rent here? eh? the northern hemisphere organ transplant society. and that's for something that's supposed to put them outta business. and they're not the only ones. we got grant money coming out of our ears.}
<A>__{he leaps up again and pulls a sheaf of reprints from medical journals like the journal of venereal disease, etc. he shoves them under st. luc's nose, then grabs a jar with a disintegrating octopus like creature in it and a sandwich at the same time. he smacks down the sandwich in front of st. luc by mistake, then retrieves it and substitutes the jar with the specimen. st. luc sifts through the papers and glances at the specimen. as st. luc looks at the papers, rollo breathes heavily down his neck and points out things of interest.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{see? there? you take a little of this... that's a very rare venereal disease you get in the nomadic crinua people, northeast asia and japan.}
<P>__{(points to a sexy}
<D>__{picture of a japanese}
<P>__{lady in heat)}
<D>__{oo. that one's got it bad. they call it batinh. that means 'kiss' or 'caress.' when you get it it makes your lips itchy, ya wanta kiss everything. i even had it once. i always get everything at least once so i know what the patient's talking about.}
<P>__{(he laughs but he's serious)}
<D>__{and there... you take a little of that... that's beautiful, isn't it? that's flexipes, the world's only cephalopod parasite.}
<P>__{(indicating the jar)}
<D>__{that's him right there. not a very good specimen. related to squids and octopuses. see? he lives in the guts of whales and big dolphins.}
<P>__{(wiggles a finger at the specimen)}
<D>__{ya like 'em big 'n hot 'n wet, don't ya? yeah.}
<A>__{he walks away from the desk. his manner is now more subdued and reflective. it seems as though everything he says provokes a dozen unspoken thoughts. his depressive phase is beginning.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{we don't do it all here, we send out to have tricky stuff done... the cell fusion, enucleation, chromosomal fission, all that fancy close work.}
<A>__{rollo sighs heavily. st. luc gently shoves all the papers aside.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{rollo, how come hobbes killed himself?}
<A>__{rollo toys with the gynecological examination table, sliding the stirrups in and out on their adjustment bars.}
<C>__{rollo}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{funny in the head. high suicide rate in the medical profession. too much body, alla time bodies, bodies.}
<A>__{he now gets close to st. luc, putting an arm around his shoulder.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{rog, i gotta talk serious to you. really. listen. ya listening? ok. i want you to come into this with me. to tell the honest to god truth, i'm lonely.}
<P>__{(begins to pace around again)}
<D>__{all hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. he wanted you in anyway. that's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. we would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<P>__{(a bit uncomfortable}
<D>__{being put on the}
<P>__{spot)}
<D>__{rollo, you know me. once a gp, always a gp.}
<C>__{rollo}
<P>__{(almost angrily)}
<D>__{you want to help sick people for the rest of your life? god forbid i should talk you out of it.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{you oughta be careful yourself. might end up cutting your throat.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{it was women did it to hobbes. couldn't handle them. that girl, that annabelle talk about crazy projects.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{who was she?}
<C>__{rollo}
<P>__{(reluctant to talk)}
<D>__{aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. they caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. she was twelve. don't ask. it was craziness, believe me.}
<P>__{(indicating the gynecological table)}
<D>__{they used to come here sometimes.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{don't ask.}
<A>__{he starts to run down like a spring wound toy at the end of its run. he glances at a picture of annabelle stuck in a corner, which st. luc just notices for the first time.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{i will never really understand how he could do what he did to her.}
<A>__{st. luc looks at his watch and gets up out of his chair for the first time.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{well, rollo linsky... i gotta go open up the store. it's been great to see you again.}
<A>__{he moves toward the door. rollo trails after him, head down, obviously dejected.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{yeah, sure.}
<A>__{they shake hands. st. luc has to open the door himself rollo is really preoccupied. finally he looks st. luc in the eye.}
<C>__{rollo}
<D>__{but you'll think about what i said about working together, huh?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{ok. i will think about it.}
<A>__{rollo manages a smile. st. luc leaves, closing the door behind him.}
