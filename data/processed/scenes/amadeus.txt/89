<L>__{interior salon in salieri's apartment night 1780's}
<A>__{constanze is sitting on an upright chair, veiled as before, the portfolio of music on her lap. through the far door leading from the hall, another servant is peering at her. the first servant joins him and shuts the door on the girl, leaving her alone. we stay with her. the clock ticks on the mantelpiece. we hear an old carriage pass in the street below. nervously she lifts her veil and looks about her. suddenly salieri appears from the music room. he is pale and very tight. they regard each other. she smiles and rises to greet him, affecting a relaxed and warm manner, as if to put him at his ease.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{well, i'm here. my husband has gone to a concert. he didn't think i would enjoy it.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{i do apologize for this afternoon. i behaved like a silly girl. where shall we go?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{should we stay here? it's a charming room. i love these candlesticks. were they here earlier? i didn't notice them i suppose i was too nervous.}
<A>__{as she talks, she extinguishes the candles in a pair of venetian candelabra and subsequently other candles around the room.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{wolfgang was given some candlesticks by king george in england, but they were only wood. oh, excuse me. let's not talk about him. what do you think of this? it's real lace. brussels.}
<A>__{she turns and takes off her shawl.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{well, it's much too good for every day. i keep saying to wolfi, don't be so extravagant. presents are lovely, but we can't afford them. it doesn't do any good. the more i tell him, the more he spends. oh, excuse me! there i go again.}
<A>__{she picks up the portfolio.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{do you still want to look at this? or don't we need to bother anymore? i imagine we don't, really.}
<A>__{she looks at him inquiringly, and drops the portfolio on the floor; pages of music pour out of it. instantly we hear a massive chord, and the great qui tollis from the mass in c minor fills the room. to its grand and weighty sound, constanze starts to undress, watched by the horrified salieri. between him and her, music is an active presence, hurting and baffling him. he opens his mouth in distress. the music pounds in his head. the candle flickers over her as she removes her clothes and prepares for his embrace. suddenly he cries out.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{go! go! go!}
<A>__{he snatches up the bell and shakes it frantically, not stopping until the two servants we saw earlier appear at the door. the music stops abruptly. they stare at the appalled and frightened constanze, who is desperately trying to cover her nakedness.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{show this woman out!}
<A>__{constanze hurls herself at him.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{you shit! you shit! you rotten shit!}
<A>__{he seizes her wrists and thrusts her back. then he leaves the room quickly, slamming the door behind him. constanze turns and sees the two servants goggling at her in the room.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{what are you staring at?}
<A>__{wildly, she picks up the candelabrum and throws it at them. it shatters on the floor.}
