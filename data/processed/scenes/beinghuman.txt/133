<L>__{exterior clearing day}
<A>__{hector and bobby have stopped at a point of bare rock looking out across the broad valley. they are building a pile of stones, a cairn. they work quietly, methodically. the only sounds are of their breathing and the click clack of the stones. we feel the echoes of our many previous hectors and their piles of stones, built for this or that purpose. our doomed surveyors are acting out the same ritual, this time in the name of science. they finish the cairn and erect their heavy tripod over it, and dangle a plumb line from the tripod. bobby scratches the center point on the top stone of the cairn. they are establishing a survey pointerior they talk as they work. when they anchor their tripod, the cold hard sound of their chisels striking rock echoes all through the forest. it unnerves them. they stop hammering and listen to the echo bouncing down the valley.}
