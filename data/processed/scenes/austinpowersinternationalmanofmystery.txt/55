<D>__{oh, god no, i made him sleep on the couch.}
<A>__{in the background, we see austin get off the couch. he is very naked and very hairy. a strategically placed vase of flowers blocks his naughty bits from view.}
<C>__{mrs. kensington }
<D>__{i'm proud of you.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mrs. kensington }
<D>__{because you managed to resist austin power's charms.}
<A>__{austin moves towards the bathroom away from the flowers. right in the nick of time, vanessa holds up a photo of number two and looks at it, blocking his naughty parts.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{well, god knows he tried, but i've been rather firm with him, mummy. you didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. it's bizarre.}
<C>__{mrs. kensington }
<D>__{you can't judge him by modern standards. he's very much a product of his times. in my day he could have any woman he wanted.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{what about his teeth?}
<A>__{split screen hotel room mrs. kensington's house}
<C>__{mrs. kensington}
<D>__{you have to understand, in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. it didn't matter.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{i just don't see it.}
<C>__{mrs. kensington}
<D>__{just wait. once austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{did you ever...}
<C>__{mrs. kensington}
<D>__{of course not. i was married to your father.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{did you ever want to?}
<C>__{mrs. kensington}
<D>__{austin is very charming, very debonair. he's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world renowned photographer. women want him, men want to be him. he's a lover of love every bit an international man of mystery.}
<A>__{we hear the toilet flush. mrs. kensington wipes off the screen. austin re enters from left to right, still naked. vanessa holds up austin's fab magazine shoot from the sixties, and in perfect timing blocks his crotch from the camera.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{you didn't answer my question, mum.}
<C>__{mrs. kensington }
<D>__{i know. let me just say this: austin was the most loyal and caring friend i ever had.}
<A>__{i will always love him.}
<C>__{austin }
<D>__{good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?}
<C>__{vanessa}
<P>__{(to her mother)}
<D>__{do you want to talk to him?}
<C>__{mrs. kensington }
<D>__{no, it's been too long. best to leave things alone.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<P>__{(to austin)}
<D>__{i'm on with a friend!}
<P>__{(to her mother)}
<D>__{look, i'd better go. i love you.}
<C>__{mrs. kensington }
<D>__{i love you, vanessa.}
<A>__{vanessa hangs up. austin enters wearing an "austin powers" robe.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{good morning, vanessa! i hope you have on clean underwear.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{we've got a doctor's appointment an evil doctor's appointment.}
