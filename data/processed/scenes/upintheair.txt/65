<A>__{ryan is just fastening his belt, having just gone through security, when we hear a beeping go off. natalie is trying to find the metal on her body that has set off the machine. she also has forgotten to take her laptop out of her bag. it's a mess.}
<L>__{interior boeing 757 mid flight}
<A>__{ryan is sketching a theoretical book cover for "the backback". natalie is working on an excel document on her laptop she's a loud tapper... hitting the keys with violent strokes. it draws ryan's attention and a raised eyebrow.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{are you upset at your laptop?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{no. why?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{fats domino had a lighter touch.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i type with purpose.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{what are you working on so furiously?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i'm building a work flow of firing techniques. questions & responses. actions & reactions. a script that works kind of like a tributary, taking you through the steps of firing someone.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{who is it for?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{theoretically, you could put it in the hands of anybody and they could be downsizing immediately. all they have to do is follow the steps.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{natalie, what is it, you think we do here?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{we prepare the newly unemployed for the emotional and physical hurdles of job hunting while... minimizing potential legal blowback?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{that's what we're selling. but it's not what we're doing.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{okay, what are we doing?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{our job is to make limbo tolerable to ferry wounded souls across the river of dread and humiliation to the point at which hope's bright shore is dimly visible...}
<P>__{(frankly)}
<D>__{and then to stop the boat, shove'em in the water, and make them swim while we row back to the palace of their banishment to present the employers with our bills.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{that was really impressive. you rehearse that?}
<A>__{natalie smiles and goes back to her work. ryan goes to say something, but holds back for now.}
