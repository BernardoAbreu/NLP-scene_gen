<D>__{fax lists the date of disappearance as august 7. on the map he's written "10 26."}
<A>__{the date on o'ryan's map reads "10 26" beside greenville, tx. so greenville gets the only blue pin on this map. charlton notes today's date: october 17...}

<D>__{any of these bodies been recovered?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{two so far. female, disappeared from dayton, ohio on april 12. and a male, trenton, new jersey, january 5th.}
<A>__{on the map, dayton's got "4 12" written beside it. trenton has "1 5." both have yellow pins in them.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{but both bodies were found over a thousand miles from where they'd last been seen. one in montana, the other in oregon. got autopsy reports on both.}
<A>__{charlton looks to the table, where autopsy reports and autopsy photos sit two victims we've never seen before. we see the victims photographed face up, face down, waist and above, waist and below. charlton gives the photos a cursory glance, nothing more. but we notice something, on one of the bodies: the male from trenton an odd burn mark on his lower left calf. looks almost symmetrical, horizontal across the calf...}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{either of the bodies have the zero on them?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<A>__{charlton, frustrated, shoves those autopsy photos aside. we look to that map, a handful of yellow pins in it...}
