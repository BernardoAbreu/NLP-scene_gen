<C>__{bowman}
<A>__{christ!}
<C>__{crawford}
<A>__{after we find lecktor's response, we substitute our own. somewhere tomorrow night the tooth fairy will actually buy tattler, looking for lecktor's message. here's what he'll find, bill.}

<A>__{'dear avid fan: inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements. mementoes for you at baltimore central. left luggage 72683.}
<C>__{crawford}

<A>__{there was no printerior i'm here for kicks .}
<C>__{beverly katz}
<A>__{one whisker. scale counts and core size match hannibal lecktor's. so does color. the color's different than the tooth fairy's taken in birmingham and atlanta. three blue grains and some dark flecks went to brian's end.}
<C>__{brian zellar}
<D>__{the grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine. must be from the cleaning man. there are several particles of dried blood. not enough to type.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{bowman?}

<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the smithsonian teeth. this is your boy...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he folded the bottom part, including what lecktor tore out. in this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions. we can make out: 'six six six'.}

<C>__{graham}
<D>__{will graham, jack crawford...}
<C>__{chester }
<D>__{we got an ad order in tonight's "tattler" with 'six six six' in it. it's being telexed to you right now.}

<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{(to graham)}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. it's a book code.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not lecktor talking to him.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{book code?}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{'one hundred prayers' could be the page number. the paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. but what book?}
<C>__{cbawford}
<D>__{not the bible?}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{no. galatians 15:2? galatians has only six chapters. the same with jonah 6:8 jonah has four chapters. lecktor wasn't using a bible.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{then the tooth fairy named the book in the part lecktor tore out.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{right .}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what about sweating lecktor?}
<C>__{graham}

<C>__{graham}
<D>__{can we still get lecktor's message out of the paper?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{yes. and i'm leery of running lecktor's message without knowing what it says.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{and if we pull it, we lose a week... we only have two to the next full moon .}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{it's your call, will. what do we do?}
