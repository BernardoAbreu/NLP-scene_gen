<L>__{interior hotel room night}
<A>__{the phone rings. estrella answers.}
<C>__{estrella}
<D>__{william's room.}
<L>__{interior rolling stone office night}
<A>__{ben fong torres is calling from rolling stone.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{can i please speak to him? this is ben fong torres at rolling stone.}
<A>__{estrella panics, hangs up quickly, as if the phone has just caught fire.}
<C>__{estrella}
<D>__{i think i just messed up!}
<L>__{interior radio station night same time}
<A>__{quince raises his head and continues on the air. the same song is still ending.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{look at the dogs, wearing the funny hats. juggling just for you. freaks and family...}
<A>__{penny shoots william a look. do you believe this guy?}
<C>__{quince }
<D>__{it's quince, with stillwater. here. live. it's the night circus.}
<A>__{the band scoots closer to the microphone, ready to talk. quince continues, looking meaningfully at the band. they are waiting... eager for a chance to speak.}
<C>__{quince }
<D>__{every minute a baby is born somewhere.. life. death. hermetically sealed bags of human emotion. bags of love... bags of kindness?}
<P>__{(suddenly, turns)}
<D>__{how'd you get together?}
<A>__{as jeff eagerly speaks, quince lowers his head and listens... feels... the words of his guests.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{well... not to get into a "me" thing... this is jeff talking... but i did start the band, some time, actually, ago. this is back when we were the jeff bebe band, and i placed an ad in a magazine called peaches looking for a guitarist and russell hammond answered.}
<A>__{quince nods, head bowed, swaying slowly.}
<C>__{quince}
<P>__{(with deep understanding)}
<D>__{peaches.}
<A>__{jeff watches quince's head lower. it's hard to know when to talk with quince. the depth of his mellowness is tough to get in rhythm with.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i think he was a gift from god, actually. nobody plays like russell hammond.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(sorta moved)}
<D>__{well, shit. thank you.}
<A>__{he instantly realizes he's slipped, on the air.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{ooops. better hit the delay button.}
<A>__{all eyes turn to quince, whose head stays down, grooving to some inner beat. he says nothing. the band looks at each other. we become increasingly aware that quince may now be asleep. long silence. william shares an amazed look with penny. quince is definitely asleep. russell leans forward and continues talking quietly, with hilarious sincerity.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{okay we're talking now, right? why the fuck do you wait until and interview in arizona to say something nice about me. why don't you say it to my fucking face sometime? because i tell you every time i think you nailed something.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{everybody pays you compliments. it's not my fucking job to kiss your fucking ass all the time.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{well then who's fucking job is it? because my ass is dying for a kiss. and i know yours is too.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{it's my fucking job. you're all geniuses. and let me just add this thought smegma.}
<A>__{penny covers her mouth as offers a look of absurdity to william. he offers one back, as laughs are stifled throughout the room. william shares a look. quince is still deeply asleep, as the usually quiet tony leans forward to speak.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{feces.}
<A>__{he cracks himself up, silently. quince snaps awake, fully in stride.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{the dong is called "love thing." your mind is starting to take effect. they're all here to see you swallow fire. you scream soundlessly... on the night circus.}
<A>__{it's quince, with}
<D>__{stillwater.}
<A>__{"love thing" takes over, as quince swivels in the chair.}
<C>__{quince }
<D>__{i thought that went well.}
