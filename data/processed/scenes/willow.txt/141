<A>__{musicians stike up a welcoming march. willow rides thorugh his village on his little pony, proudly carry ing the sacred book. the nelwyn people swarm around him, wild with excitement and celebration. meegosh runs up, deliriously happy. the high aldwin comes forward, beaming with pride, and honors willow with a nod of approval. willow presents him with the book. old burglekutt peers out. his mouth drops open and he shrinks away from the crowd.}
