<L>__{exterior geonosis, execution arena day}
<A>__{mace windu, obi wan, anakin, padme and an exhausted group of about twenty jedi stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of battle droids. the bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of dead geonosians, shattered droids and jedi. at the foot of some steps, boba fett finds his father's battered helmet. he picks it up. ki adi mundi and the survivors from the raiding party are herded into the arena by superdroids. from the encircling tiers above, thousands of battle droids level their weapons menacingly. in the archducal box, count dooku lifts his hand. the droids lower their weapons. the count calls out to the jedi.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<D>__{master windu!}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you have fought gallantly. worthy of recognition in the history archives of the jedi order. now it is finished.}
<P>__{(pauses briefly)}
<D>__{surrender and your lives will be spared.}
<C>__{mace windu}
<D>__{we will not be hostages for you to barter with dooku.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<D>__{then, i'm sorry, old friend. you will have to be destroyed.}
<A>__{the droids raise their weapons. anakin and padme clasps hands tightly. count dooku raises his hand to give the order to fire. padme looks up suddenlt and whispers to anakin.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{look!}
<A>__{above, six gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. they land in a cluster around the handful of jedi. clone troopers spill out and start firing at the droids. there is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the gunships. yoda appears at the door of one of the gunships.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{come on hurry! hurry!}
<A>__{the surviving jedi dash to the gunships and scramble in. mace windu hangs on tight as the gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim.}
