<D>__{i'm going to start with her so you'll get a good idea what's coming.}
<A>__{he takes hold of violet's pinky finger, stretching it out.}

<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{where is the money?}
<A>__{corky sees violet thrashing helplessly. she has no choice. her mouth opens as the door buzzer rings. caesar is distracted, trying to think who it could be.}

<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i put it inside one of the paint drums.}
