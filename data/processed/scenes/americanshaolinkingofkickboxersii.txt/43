<A>__{the line of disciples has stopped, waiting for drew. drew, back pack in hand, takes his place at the end of the line. they parade past a line of monks assembled in the courtyard inside the temple. as they walk by, some of the monks look nonplused, while a few are put out by the fact that drew is among them. several of the disciples turn around to look at drew, and a couple are openly hostile to him. they file up to a raised platform, on which stand 20 monks, each holding a scroll in their hands, one monk for every new disciple. a gong sounds, and the questions begin.}
<B>__{angle on first disciple}

<C>__{drew}
<D>__{yes, without pause.}
<A>__{the d.s. puts his hands over his eyes.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{i mean, no, of course not.}
<A>__{then, another gong sounds, and the quizzing is concluded. a figure moves down a corridor in beautiful robes. everyone bows down, their eyes on the floor, to the figure, who is moving towards the raised platform in the center. drew, also bowed down, sneaks a peak at the figure. it is san de! san de catches his eye and smiles slightly. he winks at drew, then clears his throat. everyone stands up again.}

<B>__{angle on san de}
<A>__{when the noise subsides.}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{your training begins tomorrow. for now, your shr fu will introduce you to our temple. welcome to shaolin.}
