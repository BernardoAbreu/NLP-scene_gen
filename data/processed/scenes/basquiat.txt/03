<A>__{rene ricard (early 30's), seated at a park bench, hunched over a notebook. he's a raggedy dandy: a poet in a hooded sweatshirt and white hightops. as he writes, he reads aloud, as if addressing posterity.}

<A>__{a head appears from the box. it's jean's. jean sees the start of a crisp, colorful autumn day. the urban park around him is alive with a typically full range of the good and bad in life. he eases himself out of the oversize box in which he has spent the night. there's something about the way that he stands while waking up that suggests he's almost surprised at his own body, the adultness of his limbs just a subtle hint of him coming out of a dream. he squints in the sunlight. he has a soft, gentle, haitian face. his hair is pulled tight to his head. he wears two pairs of blue jeans (one cut like chaps over the other) a paint covered wesleyan university t shirt, and the inside lining of an overcoat. his appearance is unruly, but it's deliberate. he's stylish. he shakes himself off and collects his stuff, which includes: a small book of pontormo drawings, a can of black spray painterior and a cigar box made into a loudspeaker with pencil holes and masking tape. jean walks out of the park and looks up past the buildings at the sky: superimposed in the sky stock footage of a hawaiian surfer jean sees the surfer, 'riding the nose' in glistening, shimmering sunlight.}
