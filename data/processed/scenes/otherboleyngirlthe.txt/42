<L>__{interior cromwell's office day}
<A>__{thomas cromwell, the former assistant to wolsey, who has now replaced him, sits at his desk, writing the letter..}
<C>__{cromwell }
<D>__{..the king has spared you because of his respect and affection for you and because you are the mother of his son."}
<L>__{exterior tower hill day}
<A>__{mary continues to read the letter, as anne is forced to kneel by the executioner..}
<C>__{cromwell }
<D>__{"but you risked your life coming to court and you are advised you not to do so again. you will not be shown the same clemency a second time. your sister anne was tried and found guilty, her crimes were high treason and she deserves to die. cromwell."}
<A>__{mary, who is reading, looks up in horror..}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{anne looks up. she sees the look on mary's face. mary's eyes. anne's eyes. `whoosh', the masked executioner swings his sword. anne is beheaded. mary almost chokes.. the crowd falls eerily silent. a stunned calm descends on tower green. nothing but the sound of the wind. mary sways, then falls backwards, having lost consciousness. she falls, falls..but is caught by a strong pair of arms.. ..william stafford, who has followed her to london. suddenly the crowds burst into life. a great, bloodthirsty roar echoes around tower green as anne's head is lifted aloft.. william stafford carries mary in his arms. they walk against the flow, of teaming crowds, and newly arriving families coming to watch the spectacle..}
