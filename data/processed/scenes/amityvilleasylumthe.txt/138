<L>__{68.interior bedroom lisa's home day}
<A>__{lisa scans down the web page and looks at photos of butch defeo and his family. suddenly she reaches a picture of 13 year old allison and her blood runs cold. she recognises allison as the little girl she encountered in the hospital hallway.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{69.interior hallway high hopes hospital night}
<A>__{lisa and delaney are sat on a bench in the hallway drinking coffee.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{do you know the history of this place?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{there's not much history. we've only been open a couple of years.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{no, i mean the history of the land.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{you mean... what was on the land before the hospital?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{i know a bit about that.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{one twelve ocean avenue. the amityville haunted house.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{well i don't know that it was haunted. lots of people think that's lies. i know about the kid that killed his family. that's true.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i didn't know about it until a friend told me.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{really? it's a famous case.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{how come you never mentioned it?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{you seem spooked already. i didn't want to make it worse.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{y'know why i'm spooked?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{because of the patients on ward x.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{it's not just that delaney. i think this place is haunted. in fact, i'm sure of it.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{you've seen something?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{remember i said i saw a little girl roaming the hallways here? i know who she is. she's one of the defeo children who were killed. you ever seen her?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{honestly?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{to be honest i don't believe in all that ghost stuff.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{well i wasn't a huge believer, but i know what i've seen.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{i believe that you've seen something. some people are more open to that kind of thing, y'know? but me? i'm closed off to that extra terrestrial stuff.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{extra terrestrial is aliens.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{whatever it's called, i don't know.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{so what do you believe in? do you believe in god?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{serious questions tonight.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i'm just curious.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{why do you ask?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{it's something i've been thinking about. how can evil exist in a world that many people believe was created by a loving god?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{i don't believe that god is a bearded man who lives in the sky. or that the devil is a red demon with horns. i believe god and satan are within all of us. god is our human side. satan is our animal side. whether we become good or evil depends which side of us we feed.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{it's a frightening thing to believe that if god exists he is not powerful enough to stop evil.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{free will in the hands of a person who feeds the evil inside them. that's what frightens me.}
<A>__{lisa ponders for a moment.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{doctor mixter must have known what stood on this land before the hospital.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{of course he did. he bought the land and organised the demolition of the house himself.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{why would he build on this land knowing the history of the place?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{he's not superstitious. he's a doctor, they don't usually believe in those things. amityville is full of local legends, going back even before the defeos.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{there's stories about the native americans being slaughtered on this land many years ago. some people even believed the indian chief possessed that kid who killed his family.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{i don't think that's true. if i've learnt anything from the patients on ward x, it's that some people have a mind that works in a different way to other people. those people who do bad things have fed the evil within them more than the good. it's not possession, it's sickness. sickness of the soul.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i don't know what to think.}
<C>__{delaney}
<D>__{just don't let your imagination run away with you lisa. you're a person who feeds that good within you. don't let this place feed the evil.}
