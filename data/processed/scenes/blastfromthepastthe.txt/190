<L>__{exterior avenue night}
<A>__{eve lets troy drive. she clutches the cigar box and rests her head on the seat as they pull away from the curb in front of the bookstore. a low rider passes them on the left. eve sees an old hag being shoved out of the bar and a homeless man slipping into the abandoned malt shop and the cross dressing street walker making eyes at passing cars and adam hanging up the pay phone he just used.}

<D>__{adam!!}
<A>__{angle adam turning when he hears eve yell his name. angle eve running from the car. the cigar box falls to the street and the contents scatter. eve could care less. besides, troy is there to retrieve everything. in a series of cuts and slo mo action the couple race into each other's arms...to the pleasure of all the lowlifes mentioned above. now the street looks more like capra than scorsese. she's surprised that she wants to kiss him so bad. he's surprised that he gets so aggressive.}
