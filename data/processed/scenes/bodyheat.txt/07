<A>__{the hottest january in fifty years has brought the crowds to the beach in search of relief. but they've been disappointed. even the breeze off the ocean seems blown from a hair dryer. still, the nights are a trifle better and the beachfront, the penny arcades, the ice cream stands and bars are busy, even now in the middle of the week. racine comes out of a bar and lights a cigarette, idly watching the passing parade. there is a free band concert in progress at the band shell. racine wanders in that direction.}
