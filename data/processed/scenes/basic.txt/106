<L>__{interior base hospital waiting room day}
<A>__{later. hardy and osborne sit in silence, eyes downcast. waiting. hardy pulls his last cigarette from the pack, lights it, crumples the pack and tosses it into a garbage can.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i pushed him too hard.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you couldn't have known }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{yeah, i could've. should've.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you wanted to get the truth.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{no, i didn't. i wanted to humiliate him. for what he did to dunbar. for fucking over the little guy.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you mean the falsely accused?}
<A>__{hardy looks up at her and nods.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you wanted to break him.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{so did i.}
<A>__{she looks back to the floor. hardy takes a drag from the cigarette, and then tosses that away too. the door opens and styles walks into the room. somber.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{it's over. time of death was 4:42.}
<C>__{styles }
<D>__{jag's been notified and i called the senator myself. my report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{that's horseshit and you know it.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{maybe. but it's my fault and i will carry it.}
<A>__{he sighs and takes a seat next to them.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{we found the cabin. demolished, like they said. no bodies. hurricane like that coulda scooped 'em up, dropped them down two counties over. we'll find them.}
<A>__{hardy says nothing.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{you think you could explain all this to me?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i wouldn't know where to start.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i guess it was about one man framing another. he thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.}
<A>__{styles nods, understanding.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{what happens to dunbar now?}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. you'll understand if i don't walk you out.}
<A>__{hardy gets up to go and then stops. realizing something.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{they're taking your command, aren't they?}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{the senator...}
<A>__{he points to kendall's hospital room.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i'm sorry, bill.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{don't be. i'm not cut out to deal with the west's of the world.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{you're a good soldier, bill.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{i thought you said that wasn't a compliment.}
<A>__{hardy smiles.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{this time it is.}
