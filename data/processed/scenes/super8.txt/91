<T>__{as we cut to:}
<L>__{interior joe's room night}
<A>__{joe sleeps, power still out. then, a knock. he wakes up. another knock. his window. he moves to it. opens it. it's alice. joe is half asleep, but also stunned. very quietly:}
<C>__{alie}
<D>__{ are you were you sleeping?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{before, earlier, b no, you okay?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{oh, you wanna come in?}
<A>__{and alice climbs in. joe sits on the floor. alice does too. it's odd and silent for a moment.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{power's still out.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{room's still messy.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i was in bed, couldn't sleep.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{thinking. i wanted to tell you something, before tomorrow don't let charles blow up your train.}
<A>__{joe stares, amazed at her.}
<C>__{alice }
<D>__{i don't think it's right, do you? i know he's your friend, but he's so bossy }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{he can be sorta li i've known him since kindergarten, though }
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{he shouldn't always get what he wants. i mean, who always gets what they want? i know i don't know you at all. even though... it sort of feels like i do.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{do you not... feel like that?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ no, i totally do, i'm just... sort of in shock at this whole conversation }
<A>__{and the power returns joe's clock light goes on behind him but more chilling, the projector comes back on; the silent home movie of his mother plays. joe crawls to the projector to stop it but:}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{ no, keep it please }
<A>__{alice moves closer to the screen. joe sits behind her. she watches the film. can't take her eyes away.}
<C>__{alice }
<D>__{... is that her?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{... yeah...}
<A>__{and as alice watches, we gently push in... as tears start to fill her eyes. behind her, at a near whisper:}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{... it's so weird watching her like this, like she's still here...}
<P>__{(beat, lost in it)}
<D>__{... she used to look at me, this way... like really look. and i just... knew i was there. that i existed.}
<A>__{a tear drops down alice's face, though joe can't see that. finally, quietly:}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{he drank that morning. my dad.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he missed his shift.}
<P>__{(beat, hard)}
<D>__{your mom took it for him. the day of the accident.}
<A>__{watching his mother, joe is quietly stunned. finally, eyes wet, alice turns to joe.}
<C>__{alice }
<D>__{... i know he wishes it was him. instead of her.}
<P>__{(hard beat)}
<D>__{... and sometimes i wish it was, too.}
<A>__{joe just stares at her... heartsick and speechless. finally:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{don't say that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he's your dad.}
<A>__{just then, the super 8 movie ends: the film flipflipflips. joe turns off the projector but a sound remains. a sort of shudder hum. joe unplugs the projector, but the sound remains. then they look: the shuddering is coming from the cube he took from the crash site, sitting on his desk. joe and alice move to it. he turns on his desk lamp. the cube vibrates, almost imperceptibly.}
<C>__{alice joe}
<A>__{ has this ? no. joe opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush he touches the cube the thing shudders on its own. they are amazed. they get low eyes at desk level the shuddering increases in pitch and volume he reaches out to touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube bullets away across the room and blasts through the wall, leaving a five inch hole in the wall! she screams they both fall to the floor, stunned push in on joe, his heart pounding. he moves to the wall looks through the hole: in the distance, trees and the town water tower.}
