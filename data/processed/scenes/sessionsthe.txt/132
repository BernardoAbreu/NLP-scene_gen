<L>__{interior motel reception. day}
<A>__{the clerk looks bored. vera looks at the time. she seems a little anxious.}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{can i use that phone to call the room?}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{sure.}
<L>__{interior motel room. day}
<A>__{the phone rings, cheryl picks it up.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{cheryl, already dressed, is getting mark dressed. she does up every button of his shirt lovingly.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{what shall we do next time? any requests?}
<A>__{mark doesn't answer.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{mark?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm thinking.}
<A>__{she finishes buttoning him up in silence. a strange feeling, a kind of chill that cheryl senses, pervades the atmosphere.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{we have two sessions left, is that correct?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{that's right. or...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{or, what?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{or, we could stop now.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you mean, make this the last session?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{there is a pregnant pause.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what do you think we should do?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{it's not we, it's you, mark. it's up to you.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i want to know how you feel.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{that doesn't come in to it.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes, it does. i don't just write poems to anyone.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{mark, what do you want me to say? how much i was touched by that? how special this has been to me? is that going to help you? no, it's going to make things worse.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you mean to say, come the sixth session that will be it?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{yes, that will be it. i explained that the first time we met.}
<A>__{mark has a serious and painful moment.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{i'm sorry. if it's any consolation, it's also hard for me to think about it.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{then maybe we should pull the plug now.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{i think maybe we should. it's only going to get harder. i guess you might as well save the money. maybe buy yourself a nice futon.}
<B>__{a little later.}
<A>__{cheryl is getting dressed. mark watches pensively. she pauses and looks at him. he keeps a brave face. there is a knock on the door.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{just a moment.}
<A>__{she and mark make eye contact for the last time. they manage to smile at each other.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{i desperately wanted to feel that because of cheryl, my life had changed. but it hadn't.}
<A>__{apart from her usual things, she is also carrying a long mirror.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{bye, mark}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{as cheryl goes out, vera comes in.}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{everything all right?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{he did great. see you. i'm sorry, i have to run.}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{see you.}
<A>__{vera walks in and closes the door behind her.}
