<L>__{exterior trevor's house evening}
<A>__{balmy and still. on bug zapper above garage, a churning, slow motion swarm of bugs repeatedly throw themselves headlong into the light.}
<L>__{interior trevor's living room continuous action}
<A>__{music plays faintly on the stereo. numerous artifacts occupy the bookshelves. a primitive african masai bow (with two arrows) is mounted on a wall. trevor, tie loosened. ellen, in nylon stocking feet, leaning back against a couch. on the coffee table before them are dirty dishes and half full wine glasses. trevor's lost in a thin introspective smile.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(breaks the silence)}
<D>__{... so you have a wife hiding in a closet somewhere?}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(smile widens)}
<D>__{no. no wife.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{don't you ever get lonely?}
<A>__{trevor considers the question.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(genuinely)}
<D>__{sometimes. there's this passage in god's lonely man by thomas wolfe where he says, '... the whole conviction of my life rests upon the belief that loneliness is the central and inevitable fact of human existence.' i believe that.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{god that's depressing.}
<A>__{they both laugh.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... my new york mentality.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's not always easy looking on the bright side.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{especially after spending a year in and out of a hospital, i would guess.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{actually, that wasn't the toughest part it's the robbery that's been hardest to recover from.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(didn't know about this)}
<D>__{what'd they steal?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{my passion. my old, unguarded self. i resent that. i want them back.}
<A>__{he offers a smile. ellen returns it.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{they're still there. everybody around me seems to have given up. they're all so beaten down. but you're different. you refuse to be beaten.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{so do you.}
<A>__{kindred souls. ellen fills her glass.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{remember the last time a student surprised you?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{you mean where a light goes on?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{yeah. where the kid surpasses all your expectations.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... been awhile. so few you can actually get through to... you?}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{... that would have to be daniel terrazas. this was last year sometime. kid was failing miserably ... but he was the best salsa dancer in the whole school.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(brightens slightly)}
<D>__{uh oh.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{so i made 'im a deal. tutoring in exchange for salsa lessons.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{saw it... jerry springer.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{no, no. he was a perfect gentleman.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{male teachers can't do things like that. they get arrested.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{yep, double standard... by the way, did you know cesar sanchez was special ed?}
<P>__{(as trevor shakes his head)}
<D>__{yep, he never should've been mainstreamed. his i.e.p. says he's l.h. but he acts more like s.e.d.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{severely emotionally disturbed... that's great.}
<A>__{a beat. then ellen gets up, wine glass balanced in her left hand.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{come on, garfield on your feet. lemme teach you how to salsa.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(resisting)}
<D>__{no, no, i'm no good at that.}
<A>__{ellen spins the tuner on the stereo to a latin station and practically yanks trevor to his feet.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{let's go. don't play shy with me, homeboy.}
<A>__{trevor grimaces, awkwardly relinquishes, as ellen walks him through it.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(still holding wine glass)}
<D>__{that's it... okay, follow me. it starts on the one. step forward with your left foot... one. change weight on, two.}
<C>__{ellen }
<D>__{and three, feet back together... now do the same in reverse, starting with your right foot.}
<P>__{(talks their way through)}
<D>__{one, two, three... one, two three...}
<A>__{trevor concentrates. up to speed now. technically he's got it, he just needs to loosen up. ellen suppresses a gleeful snicker. now, trevor attempts to cut loose. he spins ellen once, into a tango step, one two three. now an awkward dip, causing her glass to spill wine down the back of his shirt...}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(horrified, giggling)}
<D>__{oh, my god... your shirt. oh, no, i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(self conscious)}
<D>__{it's alright.}
<A>__{he dashes toward the hallway bathroom.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{can i help?}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{grab the baking soda outta the fridge.}
<A>__{in a flurry, ellen rushes into the kitchen. flips on the kitchen light, jerks open the refrigerator and locates the baking soda. following now, as she moves steadily from the kitchen to the hallway bathroom...}
