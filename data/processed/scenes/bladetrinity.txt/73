<A>__{as king and abigail lead blade towards a stairway, blade catches sight of a little girl (5) peering down at him from atop one of the rafters. as soon as he spots her, she ducks into the shadows. they reach the stairway. automated guns mounted on swivel arms lock on them with infra red targeting beams.}
