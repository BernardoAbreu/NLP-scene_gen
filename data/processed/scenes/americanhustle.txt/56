<C>__{stoddard thorsen}
<D>__{just listen to me. it's beautiful. you have a little stove. you huddle around, you keep each other warm. you drop a line and you just wait. one year my brother says, "let's go in october." he wants to go ice fishing in october. my dad says, "no, the ice is too thin." my brother says i love my brother he says }
<C>__{richie dimaso}
<D>__{i understand what's happening. you're saying your brother went out on the ice, the ice was too thin, he fell through the ice, he went in the water because he was too eager, and you're saying i'm too eager that's what you're saying?}
