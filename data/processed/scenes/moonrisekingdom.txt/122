<A>__{a burning match drops down into the fireplace near the foot of a bunk where sam lies sleeping. he has the sheet pulled up to his chin, but his toes stick out. he opens one eye. dust descends and settles. something scrapes and scratches. the flame burns out. sam slides slowly off the mattress and creeps across the floor. he crouches in front of the fireplace. he flicks on a scout flashlight and sees: the end of a hanging rope. sam leans quickly into the fireplace and looks straight up, shining his flashlight. skotak is looking down at him from the top of the chimney. he puts his finger to his lips. sam}
