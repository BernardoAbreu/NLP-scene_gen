<A>__{ through every room. every corridor. rippling out across the ground and finally dissipating in the hills beyond.}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{on his hands and knees, john takes that first breath. new lungs fill for the first time. no cough. not even a wheeze. face has renewed color. wrists have sealed tight. john is healed. he stands, steps back inside the }
<B>__{physical therapy room}
<A>__{john stops over the body of one seven foot african warrior. he stands immobilized, wrecked with emotion. a sound draws his attention to the one thing that could cause him even greater rage gabriel is hunched over near a wall. jagged cartilage stumps protrude from his back. a pattern of sinew and bone is burned into the floor behind him. it's all that remains of his once majestic wings. john approaches, spots blood dripping from the former angel. he realizes what this means. gets a kick out of it.}

<D>__{human...}
<A>__{gabriel looks up as john retrieves a gun from the wet floor.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you don't deserve to be human.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{then pass judgment on me now.}
<A>__{john raises the gun puts it to gabriel's forehead.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{do it. seek revenge. end my life.}
<A>__{john's finger nudges the trigger.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{kill me! pull the trigger! be the hand of god!}
<A>__{john pauses, realizes what's happening here...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{... and i will be condemned again...}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{do it!}
<A>__{it takes everything john has not to pull that trigger. he lowers the gun, shaking his head.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you're even worthless as bait.}
<A>__{john starts to turn away }
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{deny your true nature today, but what of tomorrow, of the tomorrow after that? it is only a matter of time before you end up right back where you belong. it is who you are, constantine. damned.}
<A>__{john's fist starts behind his back, gains momentum the entire arc until it ends abruptly against gabriel's face. the ex angel is propelled all the way to the wall slams hard against the concrete. body crumples on impact, slides down to the muck. you know this hurt like absolute hell.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that's called pain. get used to it.}
<A>__{john turns toward the double doors stops cold. huddled in the doorway, covered in grime is angela and barry. the experience has obviously left them both drained. john walks across the room, kneels down to them.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{thank you, john.}
<A>__{he nods, beat. wipes a trace of blood off her brow, puts a hand on barry's shoulder. hold a beat on this gritty family tableau.}
