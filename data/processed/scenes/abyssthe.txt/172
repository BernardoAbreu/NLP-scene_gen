<A>__{he yawns as he shambles across the chamber to the corridor door. switches off the lights. goes out. quiet lapping of water in the moonpool. a beat. then... a cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool opening, sending shadows shifting across the top of the chamber. the surface begins to pulsate. suddenly, the water itself rises, forming itself into a shifting, shimmering pseudopod as big around as a man's body. the transparent form pulses... an amoebic mass shivering in the air. it stretches, becoming a more refined form. like a blindly probing glass python, it elongates and weaves across the room. it extends and extends, stretching out from the moonpool, a shimmering tentacle. the 'head' or tip, a featureless liquid bulb, seems somehow to be scanning as it moves forward, as if it can see where it's going.}
