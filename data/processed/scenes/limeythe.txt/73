<A>__{valentine had turned his attention back to adhara and her girlfriend. when he glances back to the deck he's a little concerned not to see gordon anywhere out there anymore just wilson coming back in.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{adjusting his jacket, walking back through the house. behind him, people are rushing to the railing and looking over. a few yells of "call an ambulance!" etc. are heard.}
<B>__{valentine}
<A>__{moves that way.}
<B>__{wilson}
<A>__{moving across the room towards the front door. they are heading right toward each other.}
<B>__{wilson and valentine}
<A>__{pass each other, eyes locked, almost dream like. wilson's eyes cold, though with the hint of a smile. valentine throws a last look back before reaching the deck.}
