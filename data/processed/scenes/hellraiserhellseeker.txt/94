<L>__{interior police station hallway night}
<A>__{still handcuffed trevor is escorted toward the detention area by the cops in the sunglasses. he's silently praying he'll wake up from this one somehow. no such luck. trevor and the cops round a corner and there's lange running up to them.}

<P>__{(to the cops)}
<D>__{quick detour through the morgue boys.}
<A>__{lange leads them to a set of elevators.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{morgue...?}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{that's right trevor. the timing was impeccable wasn't it? it's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. just need you to id it for us.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{where was it?}
<C>__{lange }
<D>__{that's the weird part. it just magically turned up in the river less than thirty yards from where the car had landed. like somebody put it there while we weren't looking.}
<A>__{the elevator doors open and they get in.}
