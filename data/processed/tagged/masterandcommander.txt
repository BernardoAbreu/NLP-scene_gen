<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{exercises?}
<C>__{blakeney}

<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i think that will happen with usage, at least to a certain extent.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{touch wood, mr. blakeney. and i fancy she plans to out run us. ask dr. maturin to join us, he loves a good chase.}
<A>__{blakeney goes below. above, the topmen release more sail which is tightened by the men on deck hauling on cables. those not working sit on a row along the windward gunwale, like the crew of an ocean racing yacht, to counterbalance the pull of the sails.}

<A>__{they are running fast before a dangerous, following sea: a landscape of hills and valleys, the whole thing in terrifying motion. the forecastle now vanishes in foam with every plunge, rising each time with water pouring over the waist and spouting from her scuppers. killick comes up with the coffee pot inside his jacket. jack drinks from the spout, peering ahead into the murk. a wild unruly part of him is loving this. above him, more top men struggle up the rigging, with the mast drawing crazy figure of eights on a rushing sky.}
<L>__{152. below decks}

<L>__{153. on deck}
<A>__{the wind rising from yell to shriek. waves blown flat by it, the ship travelling at a drunken sideways angle across a raging expanse of white foam. four men on the wheel, lashed to it, with the air around them full of water. in the distance a tower of black rock on the rim of the sea, distant rollers breaking against it and surging up to a preposterous height. jack looks up at the great press of canvas as he paces the quarterdeck, the officers glancing from the sails back to}

<D>__{man overboard!}
<A>__{sail and cordage falling over the men at the wheel. a loose block and tackle swinging murderously in the gale. jack fights free from the tangle of ropes as warley vanishes in the foam. the mizzenmast is acting as a sea anchor dragging the ship's head northwards toward the black rocks. jack grabs a speaking trumpet as warley briefly reappears.}

<C>__{jack }
<D>__{reduce sail!}
<A>__{as crewmen scramble frantically into the rigging, jack turns back to see warley desperately swimming toward the trailing wreckage, his mates shouting encouragement over the howling wind. with sails reduced the ship perceptibly slows, but the dragging wreckage is swinging the ship broadside on to the waves.}

<D>__{set to then. set to!!}
<A>__{nagel's face is a mask of horror, but he obeys jacks orders and starts chopping. he and jack work shoulder to shoulder, matching blow for blow the prow keeps turning, wave after wave coming at right angles to the ship.}

<D>__{all hands to the pumps!}
<L>__{158. quarterdeck day}
<A>__{jack and nagel keep hacking at the tangle of ropes. knocking chips off the railing in their urgency to cut free the dragging mast. finally they succeed. the last of the ropes whips away, the broken mizzen disappears aft and the ship swings southward, away from the rocks. the wreckage is swept away by the next wave, leaving warley struggling, his last chance of getting back to the ship gone. then another wave breaks over him and he is gone. nagel is bereft. jack lowers his head.}

<D>__{what is the problem?}
<C>__{stephen}

<D>__{you can be as 'satiric' as you like, stephen, but i have my orders. she is attacking our whalers. for why? without whales we have no boot polish, nor any soap, nor oil for our lamps, not to oil our sabres and muskets. destroying our whalers could win the war for napoleon. which is why we must catch this acheron. as a man of learning surely you can see that.}

<A>__{to reach his quarters he is obliged to walk the length of the berth deck, past howard obsessively cleaning his pistol, another man whittling with a knife, davies adding another link in the tattooed chain about beckett's middle. no one speaks as hollom runs the gauntlet of their stares, acutely aware of his own breathing. it now seems universally to be held that he is the author of all the ship's misfortune. nagle pointedly turns his back, the scars from the flogging gleaming wetly in the lamplight hollom's breath quickens. he stumbles on someone's dunnage, almost trips but is caught before he falls. it's one of nagel's mates.}

<A>__{roused, the duty sergeant turns the glass and time resumes its flow. two bells are hesitantly rung and the crew regain the power of motion, their limbs still spastic with fear. and when the sound comes once more they all freeze. jack joins mowett at the taffrail. the thing is somewhere out there, whatever it is.}

<D>__{....then 'rendezvous portsmouth. god speed, captain pullings.'}
<A>__{a contented smile on pullings face as his promotion is confirmed. he waves across to jack as the acheron makes a sharp turn away from the surprise.}
<L>__{310. deleted 311. about the ship dusk}
<A>__{slowly the crew come back to life as old familiar habits and routines reassert themselves. acting first lieutenant mowett walks the quarterdeck composing a poem in memory of the battle. joe plaice tells a story of witchcraft and haunted ships to a small attentive audience. while awkward davies works further on the tattoo about beckett's waist. the chain begun off brazil now winds its way around most of his torso. blakeney and jemmy ducks are feeding the assorted creatures collected at the galapagos, as... bonden reads his first book, 'diseases of seamen' by stephen maturin, his brow furrowed, his lips moving silently. while the powder monkeys skylark in the rigging}

<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{jack, brother, you're gathering wool.}
<C>__{jack }

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{while i was tending the prisoners they told me their doctor died of fever, two weeks ago. there was no doctor on that ship when we boarded it. and i doubt you will find one there now.}
<A>__{jack goes very still. a silence broken only by the sound of water flowing gently past the hull. he looks down at the captain's sword on the table, the thought of a possible final deception flooding through him.}

<D>__{shall we?}
<A>__{he starts to play, the deep booming sound of the cello carrying through to ....}

<D>__{which it will be ready when it's ready!}
<A>__{in the cabin, the violin joins with the cello. rolling, undeniable music, the music of the waves, resonating through the great ship and filling the night. stephens mind is far away. jack breaks off abruptly:}

<A>__{wide, to see the stern of the ship and a patch of surrounding water lit by the great stern lantern. through the casement windows the two men can be seen playing. wider, to the vast dark sky and the heaving ocean all around, with the stern cabin, a tiny orange light, still faintly visible in the darkness.}
