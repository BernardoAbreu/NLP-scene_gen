<A>__{alice tugs bella and edward to the top of the landing, then skips down the stairs. they look down into the living room hundreds of pink candles and rose filled crystal bowls. rosalie, esme, emmett, carlisle, jasper and alice look up at her, all of them stunningly beautiful. bella would love to disappear, but edward leads her down to the living room where esme and carlisle hug bella warmly.}
<C>__{carlisle}
<D>__{sorry about all this. we tried to rein alice in.}
<C>__{esme}
<D>__{like that's even possible. happy birthday, bella.}
<A>__{flash! alice has snapped a picture of bella with them.}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(re: camera)}
<D>__{found it in your bag. mind?}
<A>__{emmett moves to edward's side. nudges him.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{dating an older woman. hot.}
<A>__{bella caught that. edward elbows him sharply to shut up.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{rosalie steps up. shoves a silver package at bella.}
<C>__{rosalie}
<D>__{it's a necklace. alice picked it out.}
<A>__{she walks away, bored. bella has to smile. she sees jasper across the room. they wave to each other.}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(aims the camera)}
<D>__{show me the love!}
<A>__{edward pulls bella into an embrace, they look deeply into one another's eyes. flash!}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{for your scrapbook. now open your presents!}
<A>__{alice drags bella over to a table piled with elaborately wrapped gifts, a huge cake and a tall stack of china plates.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{alice, i'm the only one who even eats cake. that thing could feed fifty.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{hope you're hungry. here, this one's from emmett.}
<A>__{the others crowd around... jasper somewhat away. bella, no fan of being the center of attention, opens the gift to find an empty car radio box.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{um... thanks?}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{already installed it in your truck.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{finally, a decent sound system in that piece of }

<D>__{no hating on the truck. thank you, emmett.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{open mine.}
<A>__{alice hands her a box. bella starts to open it, but }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{ouch paper cut.}
<A>__{close on bella's finger a single drop of deep red blood appears. bella thinks little of it, but then hears a disturbing, grisly snarl she looks up just as bella's pov jasper lunges toward her! teeth bared, eyes beyond reason edward flings bella behind his own body, causing her to crash into the table, plates shattering as jasper slams into edward; sounds like boulders colliding. edward pushes him, hard; jasper sails backward, hitting the wall. but he ricochets off it and comes back at bella. emmett and carlisle tackle jasper from the side, dragging him to the ground alice helps hold him down }
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(soothingly)}
<D>__{jaz... shhh }
<A>__{... but she stops, her head suddenly jerking toward bella. then everybody's eyes snap toward bella as they catch the overwhelming scent on bella lying amid the shards of broken china. she looks at her arm, seeing now it's been slashed by plate shards; bright red blood pulses out of her, pooling. she looks up bella's pov the cullens (slow motion) all of them now, including edward (but not carlisle) stare down at her, at her blood, with fevered eyes. six suddenly ravenous vampires... slow motion abruptly ends as carlisle jumps to bella's side. edward, though white as a bone, snaps out of it and stands between her and the others.}
<C>__{carlisle}
<D>__{emmett, get jasper out of here.}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{emmett.}
<A>__{emmett reins himself in, elbows rosalie. they drag the snarling jasper out. esme holds her nose, politely exits with the others. alice looks at bella, apologetic }
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i... can't...}
<A>__{she slips out the door. edward's still on guard as carlisle examines bella's arm.}
<C>__{carlisle}
<D>__{i will have to stitch this up.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i will carry her to the kitchen.}
<A>__{he moves to pick her up, but his eyes dart to the blood.}
<C>__{carlisle}
<D>__{i will take care of her, edward.}
<P>__{(edward doesn't move)}
<D>__{check on jasper. go.}
<A>__{edward looks from him to bella. then steps back, allowing carlisle to lift bella and carry her to the kitchen. but just before the kitchen door closes, bella sees edward's agonized face. he turns away, unable to meet her eyes...}
