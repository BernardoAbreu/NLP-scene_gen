<L>__{exterior blast site day}
<A>__{ten police investigators in the crater with grant. outside the crater: pieces of vehicles laid out outside: 1 2 of a door, 1 4 of a front axle, bits of engine. five feet away from that: stacks of bagged evidence, two dozen evidence containers. sykes clambers out of the hole, streaks of re animated mud where sweat streams out of his hairline, mad dashing for his chin. a chunk of metal in one hand, something small in the other: a marble. he drops it in the appropriate cannister then steps to a chunk of metal: one half of an alternator. sykes stares down at the pieces of completely mangled metal. he studies a piece of twisted, half melted iron. thinking... he walks over to a second larger piece of twisted metal. starts trying to fit the two pieces...like a puzzle.}
