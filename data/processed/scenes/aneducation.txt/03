<L>__{interior bedroom. day}
<A>__{jenny's bedroom. books about ponies, a much loved teddy bear; a cello huge in the small room leans against the wall. jenny is bent over a small desk. victorian novels, latin primers and dictionaries teeter in huge towers either side of her. she stands and stretches as she turns to us. she kneels and flicks through her half dozen or so lps on the floor near a cheap record player they're all classical, mostly by elgar, apart from a juliette greco record. this is the one she chooses. as the music begins, she sings along. immediately there is a thumping noise someone underneath her is banging on the ceiling impatiently.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{i don't want to hear any french singing. french singing wasn't on the syllabus, last time i looked. jenny sighs, and reaches for the volume control. she turns the music down so low that she has to lie down and put her head right next to the dansette to hear it. close on jenny as she silently mouths the words along with the almost inaudible track.}
