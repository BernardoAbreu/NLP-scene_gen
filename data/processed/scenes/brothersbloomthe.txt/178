<L>__{exterior beach house night}
<A>__{a wood patio with steps leading down to the sand. bloom watches penelope, now very distant, almost gone. stephen comes out, pulls out a flask.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{hey.}
<P>__{(nothing)}
<D>__{i think that was the most honest conversation we've ever had.}
<P>__{(more nothing)}
<D>__{you actually connected on a few of those punches.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{did you expect me to do it? to come here tonight, end it the way you wrote it? or were you really disappointed i didn't run off with her?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i was disappointed. but i wasn't surprised.}
<A>__{bloom turns and slugs him in the jaw. stephen falls to the sand.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{i let you do your monologue, but you wanna know why i did it? i did it so she'd never want to see me again. to get her away from all this for good.}
<A>__{without looking back bloom walks off down the beach, in the opposite direction of penelope, leaving stephen bleeding in the sand, alone in the dark uncertain night.}
