<L>__{interior mess hall}
<A>__{the meeting is breaking up as the door clangs open and hippy is thrusted inside. his hands are taped behind his back and he stumbles onto his face. coffey steps through smoothly, straight arming the .45. schoenick flanks him with the assault rifle aimed at the group.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{freeze! don't move. that's it.}
<P>__{(to monk)}
<D>__{here, hold this a second. we're going to phase three.}
<A>__{he hands his gun to monk, with the assumption of absolute loyalty from a team member. monk's eyes move between coffey and the pistol. we can't tell what he's thinking. coffey grabs hippy and shoves him onto a chair.}
<C>__{hippy}
<D>__{they're using big geek to take the bomb to the ntis! we set it up to go right to them.}
<A>__{lindsey looks stricken. her plan is betraying them all.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{oh my god... oh no...}
<P>__{(steps toward coffey)}
<D>__{please, you can't. coffey, think about what you're doing... for god's sake }
<A>__{coffey lets her approach him, his eyes glittering. without warning he grabs her by the hair and hurls her against the coke machine, pinning her there with one hand. bud leaps forward.}
<C>__{schoenick}
<D>__{get back!}
<A>__{bud freezes. the rifle's muzzle is aimed for a heart shot. coffey moves up close to lindsey.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{this is something i've wanted to do since i first met you.}
<A>__{his hand reaches down, out of frame. we hear something rip. his hand comes back up... holding a piece of gaffer's tape. he slaps it over her mouth. then pushes her down into a chair. hippy looks at monk and schoenick.}
<C>__{hippy}
<D>__{you boss is having a full on meltdown. guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!}
<C>__{monk}
<D>__{what's the timer set for?}
<C>__{schoenick}
<D>__{three hours.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{shut up! don't talk!}
<C>__{monk}
<D>__{we can't get to minimum safe distance in three hours. the shockwave will kill us. it'll crush this rig like a semi driving over a beer can.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{shut up! shut up! what's the matter with you?!}
<A>__{everybody is twitching a hyper. schoenick is white knuckling his assault rifle... looking from monk to coffey to the group.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{just stay calm. the situation is under control.}
<A>__{coffey backs out quickly with schoenick.}
