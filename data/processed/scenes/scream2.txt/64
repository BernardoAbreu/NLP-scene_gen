<L>__{exterior newsvan campus later}
<A>__{the newsvan is parked at a curb. it sits out of the way overlooking the student commons area. a grassy area where students sit and conjugate. gale walks back and forth with the cellular attached to her ear. dewey sits leans against the van, watching her. he still has a crush but hides it as best he can.}
<C>__{gale}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{the interview's not going to happen. 1 changed my mind. i've harassed the girl enough. it's in poor taste and a bad idea.}
<C>__{from the phone}
<D>__{your entire career is in poor taste...}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{gotta go, call me when you have something nice to say.}
<A>__{gale hangs up, she looks to dewey. smiles.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{so what made you change your mind about sidney?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{mood swing. i'm manic depressive.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{you're a hard one to figure out.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{it's that complex yet shallow quality. it's deliberate.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i think you're all an act.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{and deep down i'm a good person? make no mistake, dewey, i'm a shit.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i know that.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i also know that you're an aging tv reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non positive manner. a coupla failed relationships with i'm guessing balding, older men have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. but i bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.}
<A>__{gale stares at him, stunned. a moment as the tension swirls about them.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{and where did you gain all of your gale weather's insight?}
<A>__{dewey approaches her. gale has never been more taken with him. they stand incredibly close.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{after my spinal cord was damaged i was laid up for over a year. a lot can happen when you're on your back.}
<A>__{they're nearly touching now. just then, randy approaches.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{what'd i miss?}
<A>__{gale backs away from dewey, breathless. her cellular phone rings. she eyes dewey, then hands it to randy.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{i'm not here.}
<A>__{randy takes the phone.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{gale?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{she's not here right now.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{but she's standing right next to you.}
<A>__{shit! randy motions to gale and dewey. it's him. he points around campus, mouthing "he's watching." gale grabs dewey.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{c'mon.}
<P>__{(to randy)}
<D>__{keep him talking.}
<A>__{gale and dewey race off, across the grassy area where students come and go.}
<B>__{on randy}
<A>__{he holds the phone, scared, not knowing what to say?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{so... what's your favorite scary movie? no response. silence.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{they'll never find me.}
<A>__{randy eyes dewey and gale, they move through students, searching.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{what do you care? let 'em have their fun. so, what's up?}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{what's your favorite scary movie?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{showgirls. absolutely frightening. what's yours? wait, let me guess. the house on sorority row? final exam. graduation day? the dorm that dripped blood? splatter university? am i close?}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{closer than you think.}
<B>__{on dewey and gale}
<A>__{they move through passing students.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{he has to be nearby. he likes the game.}
<A>__{dewey is on the his walkie. "i need back up." he has a hard time keeping up with gale. he hobbles along.}
<B>__{back on randy}
<A>__{he goes on a tirade pacing back and forth.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{so what's your deal? can we talk openly for a second? how does one become a serial killer? huh? are you psychopathic or merely psychotic? and what is the distinguishing feature'? were you slapped around as a child? is it hereditary? did your mom take test drugs? you know, have you tried getting laid? it's done wonders for my homicidal tendencies.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{do you want to die?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{gee, let me think. "do you want to... " is that the best you can do? some tired hand me down rehash? hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. no movie rights. nothing. i've been through this before and much better i might add.}
<B>__{on gale and dewey}
<A>__{gale spots a young man, sitting with some other kids. he's talking on a cellular phone. she races to him and rips it from his hands. he leaps up ready to pounce on her. dewey appears.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{it's okay. c'mon, gale.}
<B>__{back on randy}
<A>__{randy won't let up. he continues dissing.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{and if you're such a brilliant smart killer why copycat? why not be original? where's the innovation? let's pioneer some new ground. make a statement. go down in history. now you'll always be the woodsboro copycat killer. that's lame. it's like a bad sequel. and why woodsboro? what about manson, bundy, son of sam? why imitate two high school loser ass dickheads 1 knew the guys. stu was a wussy ass wet rag and billy jesus what a rat looking homo repressed, mama's boy.}
<A>__{suddenly the newsvan door rips open, a ghost masked figure lunges out grabbing randy by the neck. the move is quick and precise. a hard yank and randy is wrenched back into the newsvan. the door slams shut.}
<B>__{on dewey and gale}
<A>__{as they run back to the newsvan. sirens are heard in the distant. gale races up to find randy nowhere.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{randy? randy? where did he go?}
<A>__{dewey circles the van as gale moves to the sliding side door. she tears it open as... randy's body falls out. blood everywhere. his throat slit. gale's scream is heard all over campus.}
