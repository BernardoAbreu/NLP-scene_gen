<A>__{imam and audrey stagger aboard. safe in the light of the headbeams, fry turns back, panting, waiting. waiting.}

<D>__{captain....}
<A>__{he wants her to board the skiff. fry gives it another beat, eyes sweeping the dark rain. and just when we think it's over for riddick terrible screams are heard from both man and predator: there's a helluva fight going on out there. close out there. fry snatches the glow worms off imam's neck... and plunges into the darkness, homing in on the sounds until... a blade flashes in her face . she ducks and spots... riddick. bloody, muddy, he's down on his knees, still trying to fight off the shadow beasts that swirl and slash all around him. around them both .}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{it's me, it's me, it's me!}
<A>__{she gets the light around his neck. now we see his face clearly and see a very human expression there: fear. fry grabs his armpits and tries to pull him up.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{c'mon, riddick said i'd die for them , not you.}
<A>__{he gets his feet under him. gripping each other, they start moving, turning like dancers in a macabre waltz, hoping the predators can't fix on riddick's blood.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{just 10 steps...keep turning, keep turning...that's right...others're already 'board, waitin' for us right now...five steps...c'mon, almost there, riddick... almost there...we're almost }
<A>__{something jolts them. all clicking stops.}
