<L>__{interior jackson, steinem investment house day}
<A>__{credits continue to run. bud moves past the functional reception area, past carolyn, a cheerful young black girl.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{how you doing buddy?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{great carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...}
<A>__{he slips off his overcoat, flicks some lint off his paul stuart $500 suit, and enters the main trading room. brokers mill by their desks, gulping coffee, scanning the papers, the quotrons. the digital clock by the big board counter clicks to 9:26 am four minutes until the market opens. you can smell the hunger. bud takes a deep breath, tosses the newspaper away and struts into the office fuck it it's a new day. moving past dan steeples, a flush faced old timer, a blue and white yale tie, with a carnation in his lapel.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{morning, dan. what's looking good today?}
<C>__{steeples}
<D>__{if i know i wouldn't be in this business. get out while you're young, kid. i came here one day, i sat down, and look at me now.}
<A>__{past charlie cushing, on the phone, a handsome chunk of man with rugged good looks and ivy league mannerisms.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{...hey chuckie, how's the woman slayer?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{...if i had your looks, better.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(used to it)}
<D>__{...takes years of genetics, pal, and a yale education... and the right tailor.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{...not that you learned anything, chunk.}
<A>__{bud reaches his trading desk, whips open his briefcase and pulls out a computer print out of last night's homework.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, marv.}
<C>__{marv }
<D>__{yeah, where's your machine gun.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{joke about it. i was up all night charting these stocks. you want to see this or what?}
<A>__{his associate, marvin, a manicky wise guy, swivels over his chair from a nearby desk. he gives the charts a quick read.}
<C>__{marv}
<P>__{(scowling)}
<D>__{looks bearish to me, buddy. you got it all upside down.}
<P>__{(confidential)}
<D>__{okay, i'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause i feel sorry for you. take the knicks against the bullets, and my pick of the day duke to beat the spread against wake forest.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{thanks, marv, with that i might be able to qualify for welfare.}
<A>__{lou mannheim, strolls in, a dignified looking older broker in his late 60's, wearing an old brown brim hat with button down white shirt, narrow tie, very much a picture from another era... a kind humor in his eyes... but obviously ailing in the legs and breath department.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(friendly)}
<D>__{you got a look in your eye, mr. mannheim... you got something for the small fry...}
<C>__{mannheim}
<D>__{jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. the biggest mistake we ever made was letting nixon get off the gold standard. putney drug you boys might want to have a look at it.}
<C>__{marv}
<D>__{take 5 years for that company to turn around.}
<C>__{mannheim}
<D>__{...but they got a good new drug. stick to the fundamentals, that's how ibm and hilton were built...good things sometimes take time.}
<A>__{the stentorian voice of office manager hieronymus lynch booms over the intercom. we see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit office; tall, balding with a perpetual worried look on his face.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{attention. please. office production is down ten percent this week. i recommend that you all go through your clients' investments for any portfolio adjustments. and don't forget double commissions today on our 'a' or better bond funds.}
<P>__{(looking in bud and marv's direction)}
<D>__{especially you rookies. also, remember, the sales contest ends tomorrow.}
<A>__{bud and marvin roll their eyes. the digital clock flashes}
