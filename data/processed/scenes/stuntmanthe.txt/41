<A>__{a camera rig suspended from the end of the yellow construction crane is photographing the surf where extras in german wwi uniforms unload ashore. the bright little plane has started a lazy dive toward the soldiers, its engine whining. from here it looks as fearsome as snoopy and the red baron.}

<A>__{as the british plane pulls out of the dive, there is a tremendous explosion. in the flash of smoke and flame, barge, rowboats, ammunition and people are blown sky high. the smoke from the exploding ammunition momentarily obscures the scene.}
