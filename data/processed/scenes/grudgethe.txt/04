<A>__{ and walk hand in hand down the much quieter street, away from the crowded thoroughfare. doug smiles as they pass by two japanese high school couples, making out on the street corner. he turns to give karen a sarcastic look but she didn't notice the school kids. she's looking in the other direction, at a trickle of smoke wafting up over a nearby fence.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{doug follows as she walks toward an old temple, nestled beneath a skyscraper. a collision of the ancient and modern. the fence surrounds a graveyard adjacent to the temple.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{we walk past this temple every day, karen }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yeah, but i've never seen this before.}
<A>__{a japanese man stands before an ornate headstone, lighting a bundle of incense and bowing before the grave.}
<C>__{karen}

<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it's not trivia. it's what they believe. and it's far better, by the way, than your little pollution ritual.}
<A>__{doug's grin softens to a smile. he doesn't respond... but the way he's looking at karen makes her curious:}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{he turns away for a moment, almost shyly, dropping his cigarette and crushing it. finally:}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{nothing. i just i like that about you. you seem to be able to remember everything that's really important.}
<A>__{she smiles. a tender moment. then... he checks his watch.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{except the time.}
<A>__{karen checks her own watch, realizing }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{oh, crap }
<A>__{she grabs his hand and starts to walk quickly.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{c'mon, you're gonna be late.}
