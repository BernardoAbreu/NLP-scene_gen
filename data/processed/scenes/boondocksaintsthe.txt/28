<L>__{interior connor and murphy's apt early next morning}
<A>__{connor and murphy, fairly beat up, sit up on their beds. they wear tattered bathrobes and boxer shorts. they put their feet down into their leather boots. the boys examine the extent of one another's injuries and reflect on their hangovers. they both laugh and grab their heads in pain. boom! the door breaks open and in hobbles checkov and vladdy, guns drawn. checkov is all beat up and the ass of his pants is burnt out. a bulky bandage covers his buttocks. vladdy has a large bandage around his head. the boys stand in surprise. ivan smashes connor in the forehead with his gun, sending blood gushing down his face as he falls to the floor. murphy helplessly yells his brother's name as he is brought to his knees by vladdy. ivan positions connor on his knees before the toilet, which is open to the room. checkov puts his foot on connor's head and proceeds, as he struggles, to hand cuff him to the old toilet. so now connor is bleeding and hugging the commode with his hands cuffed behind the bowl base.}
<C>__{checkov}
<P>__{(almost whispering)}
<D>__{i was going to kill you. but i'm not... i'm going to kill your brother. i'm going to take him down to the dumpster and i'm going to shoot him in the head. then i'm going to throw his dead body in the garbage.}
<P>__{(looks at this watch)}
<D>__{trash guys are coming in 10 minutes, gotta go.}
<A>__{checkov walks towards the door and says "let's go" to vladdy.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{it was just a bar fight. you guys are fuckin' pussies!}
<A>__{vladdy pulls him to his feet and leads him away following checkov. connor, blood running from his face, listens to absolute silence for just a moment. suddenly his face reads the gravity of the situation. in a split second he turns into an animal. he's yelling, pulling, tugging and growling. his body is a whirlwind of motion. the skin on his wrists bleeds profusely.}
