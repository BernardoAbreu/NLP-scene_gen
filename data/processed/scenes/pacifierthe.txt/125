<L>__{interior old warehouse continuous}
<A>__{shane follows the hitler youth into a large room, set up with folding chairs. he hides in a dark corner. todd and the hitler youth enter, and take seats. a creepy man in a scarf walks out, and stands in front of them. shane watches as the man addresses the hitler youth.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{alright. all my nazis are finally here. okay, i want all of you at attention.}
<A>__{the nazis stand at attention. shane is horrified...}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{and on stage left (he yells) von trapps! i need my von trapps!}
<A>__{shane watches... as a group of blonde actors, all dressed in lederhosen as the singing von trapp family enter, and join the "nazis." there's also a few nuns, a captain von trapp, and a maria. the creepy man is, in fact, a good natured, slightly foppish director.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{okeydokey. starting from where we left off gimme rolf and liesl let's give you are sixteen a run up der flagpole...}
<A>__{todd heads up to the stage, the director arranges him and the actress playing liesl (40ish) into position. an accompanist begins on piano, todd sings, remarkably well:}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you wait little girl, on an empty stage for fate to turn the light on your life little girl, is an empty page that men will want to write on... actress liesl to write on...}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you are sixteen, going on seventeen...}
<A>__{shane bursts into laughter. his whole face lights up for the first time ever... todd and liesl dance. todd is good, but nervous. he attempts a spinning kick, but he slips, and hits the stage, clutching his ankle. he gets up, and limps to the seats. the director walks onto the stage, upset. he looks up, to heaven:}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{baby jesus, have i done some unspeakable evil that i deserve to be saddled with the world's worst production of sound of music? (he shouts, at the cast:) we open in a week. the set's not finished... the cast is a bunch of clumsy goats every kick ball change would make bob fosse dig himself out of the earth, so he could have a heart attack again.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i'm sorry... i will get it right.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{none of you will ever get it right! which is why, i quit.}
<A>__{he throws down his script. the cast is stunned.}
<C>__{director }
<D>__{and with that, he exits stage right... end scene.}
<A>__{and, on his own cue... he exits stage right, in a huff. the entire cast looks to todd, fuming. shane jumps up from his hiding place, startling everybody. everyone steps back. todd is terrified. shane kneels down beside todd. he closes his eyes, and begins rubbing his hands together like mr. miyagi.}
<C>__{liesl}
<D>__{you gonna fix him?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{no. my hands are freezing.}
<A>__{shane grabs todd's ankle hard and unceremoniously cracks it, and yanks him to his feet.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i'm not going to quit. i hate wresting...}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{at ease. (todd shuts up) would you listen, just once? look, i don't know a hell of a lot about this kinda stuff, but... you're good. a lot to learn, but with hard work, discipline you could make a go of this.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{... but what about murney?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{that guy's an idiot.}
<A>__{todd smiles, relieved. they sit on the edge of the stage.}
<C>__{shane }
<D>__{"sound of music" is a great show. my dad took me to see it when i was a kid.}
<A>__{shane smiles wistfully. todd relaxes.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you don't seem like the musical type.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{come on. julie andrews was hot.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what if... girls'll think i'm... weird or something?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{you know what girls think is weird? wrestling. men in leotards pinning each other to the floor? i've never understood that. chicks dig guys who can dance.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{doesn't matter now anyway... show's off... it's over.}
<A>__{shane looks at the cast, they look pretty glum as they pack up their costumes. todd looks devastated only a moment after shane saw him happier than ever. shane straightens up, grabbing todd by the shirt collar. beat.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{company center stage!}
<A>__{everyone looks around, they're not sure what to do... off shane's glare, they quickly assemble on stage.}
<C>__{shane }
<D>__{do you, or do you not have what it takes to perform this musical?}
<A>__{there's some mumbling. liesl chimes in.}
<C>__{liesl}
<D>__{we don't have a director...}
<A>__{shane shakes his head.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{no director? i have directed rescue missions in afghanistan! i've directed numerous snatch and grabs in countries who's names you are not allowed to know. i have choreographed multi pronged amphibious landings and stealth air attacks!}
<P>__{(full of bravado)}
<D>__{do you think i have the stomach to whip this production into shape, or not?}
<A>__{everyone nods... todd looks up at shane. he smiles.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{yes what? todd cast yes sir.}
