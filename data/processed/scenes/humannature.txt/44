<L>__{exterior zoo day}
<A>__{faded colors. ten year old nathan in a bow tie and shortpanted suit walks along with his uptight, british parents. they arrive at the ape pen. nathan is excited. he jumps up and down. the apes jump up and down also.}
<C>__{nathan as a boy}
<D>__{monkeys! look, mama, monkeys!}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(clamping down on his shoulder)}
<D>__{nathan, those are not monkeys. those are apes. mountain gorillas to be precise.}
<A>__{there is a commotion off screen. two uniformed attendants drag puff's father, straitjacketed and kicking and screaming like an ape, past nathan and his parents.}
<C>__{puff's father}
<D>__{i am not a human being! i am an animal!}
<A>__{nathan, his father, and the other zoo patrons look on curiously, a little frightened. nathan's mother chooses to ignore it.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{and furthermore... tell him, harold.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{uh...}
<P>__{(then by rote)}
<D>__{we must never act like apes, son. for you see, the ape is our closest biological relative specifically the pygmy chimp.}

<D>__{a single chromosome separates us. but you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?}
<C>__{nathan as a boy}
<D>__{no, papa. what?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{culture. civilization. refinement. if we do not have these as humans, then we might as well be living in pens and throwing our feces about, masturbating in public...}
<P>__{(beat, a reverie)}
<D>__{...sniffing red swollen female rump...}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{enough, harold.}
