<L>__{interior hall of the heavens night}
<A>__{food is out. hundreds of tables are set with black linen table cloths. decorations have a dark, haunted house theme. a hum of activity floats up past the vast corinthian columns into the circular dome above.}
<L>__{interior margo's laboratories night}
<A>__{an explosive sneeze rattles the beakers and dislodges the plant specimens. margo interrupts her work at the computer to hand greg a tissue as frock looks on.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{what kind of egg is it?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it's reptilian.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{like the claw.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(cautious)}
<D>__{let's not jump to conclusions. this egg could belong to any number of reptiles, dr. frock.}
<C>__{frock}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{come on, margo. we're on the verge of something huge. let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room. what if john was right. i mean, what if? and he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates. when it got to the museum, it hatched.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{several problems with that theory. for one thing, this egg is intact. for another, according to pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat. everyone on board was killed like beauregard. if the thing hatched in mid ocean, where did it go?}
<A>__{frock has no answer. greg gestures to his computer screen.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{i guess you're not interested in this plant anymore, but the chemical analysis is done. frock reads the computer over greg's shoulder.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{"genus: unknown. family: unknown. order: unknown. phylum: unknown. cripes, margo, what did you give me? is this an animal or one funky shrub?"}
<P>__{(to kawakita)}
<D>__{i see you've been programming the computer vocabulary again.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(points to a hexagonal symbol)}
<D>__{look at this. an ambyloid reovirus protein. that explains why the computer's confused. the plant's infected with a virus.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{that's not so unusual. many plants carry viruses. like the burls on maple trees.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{but a virus normally codes for other viruses. this one's making human and animal proteins. listen to this.}
<P>__{(reads)}
<D>__{"glycotetraglycine collagenoid. weinstein's tropic hormone. 4 monoxytocin supressin hormone."}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{these plant fibers are loaded with hormones!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{what kind of hormones?}
<A>__{kawakita pulls a heavy book from the shelf. the encyclopedia of biochemistry, thumbs to a page and reads.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{4 monoxytocin is... "a hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{try weinstein's tropic hormone.}
<A>__{the tension is rising in the room. frock takes the book, looks this one up, reads silently and removes his glasses.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{a hormone secreted by the human thalamus gland.}
<A>__{kawakita and frock look puzzled. margo rises in agitation.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{this is it. this is what he, or it... is after! the plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!}
<C>__{kawakita}
<P>__{(pales)}
<D>__{eats them?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{yes. whatever killed beauregard may have lived on this plant. when the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach. the killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{beauregard's head.}
<A>__{there's a moment of stunned silence. then a loud buzzer makes them all jump.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it's all right. that means the g.s.e. has finished analyzing the claw dna. greg, you go find pendergast and lieutenant d'agosta now.}
