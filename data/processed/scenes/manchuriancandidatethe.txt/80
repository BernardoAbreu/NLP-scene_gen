<A>__{a narrow, glassed in space with a cluster of monitoring equipment against the wall of darkened windows. fluorescent lights flicker on, revealing a cavernous space below, in which an intricate maze of cages contains unhappy, screaming research monkeys with orwellian stainless steel hardware and antennae bolted to their bisected skulls. strange sounds and various lighting effects emerge from the different sections.}

<C>__{marco}
<D>__{ delp. it's not gws.}
<A>__{delp has known marco too long, and too well, not to take him seriously.}

<D>__{a dozen years ago, the army did this tiny implantable i.d. thing you could imbed it under the skin, then scan it like a bar code for medical emergency information, blood type, dna. pentagon ordered up half a million, and stuck about five thousand experimentally into high risk soldiers and infantry. but the scanners proved skittish and field hospitals hated 'em, so the whole deal got eighty sixed and forgotten.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{the army never put one in me.}
<C>__{delp}
<D>__{that you know of, man. that you know of.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{how'd you find me?}
<C>__{marco }
<D>__{i looked under mad scientists in the yellow pages there was a full page ad.}
<C>__{delp}
<D>__{ha ha.}
<A>__{marco stares down into a big pit. among the racks of equipment are two primate sized stainless steel beds with restraints and i.v. trees waiting.}
<C>__{delp}
<D>__{you seriously believe somebody's messed with your mother board.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{what are you studying here, delp?}
<C>__{delp}

<C>__{delp}
<D>__{nah, cia cut me loose in '97 during the macedonian debacle. now i got this little grant from wal mart.}
<A>__{wal mart? fear? marco looks at the monkeys. doesn't want to know any more. he shifts his gaze back to delp. studies him. then:}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{look, delp. my experiences during the war, in kuwait ... feel dreamlike to me. and my dreams? about what happened? feel as real as you and me, here, right now.}
<A>__{delp just waits.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{it's like ... i feel like somewhere along the line, i've been ... brainwashed. or something. you know? all scrambled up.}
<C>__{delp}
<D>__{we've all been brainwashed, marco. religion, advertising, television. politics. we accept what's normal because we're told it's normal and we crave normalcy. hell, look at the germans under hitler. disco, in the seventies.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and if you're really worried about somebody imbedding electric probes and computer chips in your brain to make you do things it's horseshit, man. turns out pavlov had it right from the getgo. dogs and all. a little ect and sleep deprivation will do the trick for a fraction of the price. ask the uzbeks. and you would remember it.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{what about my dreams?}
<C>__{delp}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{what if all this is the fucking dream and you're still back in kuwait?}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{you're not helping me.}
