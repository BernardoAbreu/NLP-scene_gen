<A>__{through the last traces of early morning mist another group of black clad figures make their way down a lane.}
<L>__{exterior country lane day}
<A>__{an amish buggy, black and highwheeled, stark against the landscape, appears, a spirited chestnut in the traces. framed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern figure of an amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat, his bonneted wife in muted colors, the face of a boy, attired like his father, peering out. the horse's breath smokes on the frosty air, the buggy creaks on its springs, and there's the rhythmic clip clop of hooves on the pavement.}
<B>__{another lane}
<A>__{two amish buggies reach a crossroads, join a procession of three others. they disappear as the lane wends through a leafless thicket of hickory.}
<B>__{valley}
<A>__{a big shot... now the procession numbers almost a dozen buggies... it is headed toward a distant farmhouse.}
<B>__{barnyard}
<A>__{where literally dozens of carriages are parked. the horses have been taken from the traces, removed to the shelter of the barn.}
