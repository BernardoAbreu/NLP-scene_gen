<D>__{mr. morrison, how do you feel about being called the "ultimate barbie doll".}
<A>__{on jim a beat. a sickly smile spreads.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i guess when you say something like that, it's a shortcut to thinking.}
<C>__{journalist 3}
<D>__{then do you "think" about the dreadful reviews your new poetry book has gotten?}

<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{have you bothered to read the poetry ma'm? you keep denying that anything good can come from l.a., i mean isn't that kind of a provincial attitude? that bob dylan's the only poet cause he's from the east coast, but you won't even look past jim's goddamn looks at the words man!}
