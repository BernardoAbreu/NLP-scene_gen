<A>__{to a now virtually complete, half painted white gazebo. slaves continue to work on it. as they do so, bass peels away from the structure to have an overview. he beckons solomon toward him, out of earshot from the slaves who are continuing to work on the gazebo. as solomon approaches, bass shouts }
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{and bring those markers!}
<A>__{solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and approaches bass.}
<P>__{bass (cont’d)}
<D>__{no letter yet.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{you are certain?}
<A>__{bass takes a marker from solomon and slides it into the earth.}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{i have inquired thoroughly. more than is safe for either of us.}
<A>__{bass takes another and pokes it into the ground, improvising a pathway towards the gazebo.}
<P>__{bass (cont’d)}
<D>__{solomon...i have a job or two on hand which will be completed shortly... the work here has grown sparse.}
<A>__{bass doesn't need to spell things out for solomon. solomon's understanding of the finality of the situation should be very clear.}
<P>__{bass (cont’d)}
<D>__{you must know, wherever i am i will press your cause.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{five months. on top of these years. no cause remains.}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{if there is any chance...}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{mr. bass...}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{i will continue to write your people }
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{go home knowing you have tried.}
<A>__{the weight of defeat should hang very heavily with both men. nothing more to do, nothing more to say bass takes solomon's hand, grips it firmly, but low and surreptitiously knowing full well he cannot be seen making contact with a slave. but in the strength of their collective grip, in the emotion in which they hold each other's eyes, we should be able to easily see how greatly bass wanted to be able to help solomon. equally, we can see the depth of regard solomon has for bass. the moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither man can openly speak his regret or thanks. a moment longer, and then bass releases his grip and makes his way marching toward the gazebo, pointing instructions. solomon is left, markers in hand, alone.}
