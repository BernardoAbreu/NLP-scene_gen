<A>__{szpilman looking down from the fourth floor window. peaceful. a few pedestrians. an everyday atmosphere. at the far end, at the t junction with a main road, a tram rumbles down the street and comes to a halt, disgorging passengers on the far side and so out of sight. the tram continues on its way, now revealing the few passengers who alighted '97 women, an old man with a stick. last, three young poles, carrying long objects wrapped in newspaper. one of the men looks at his watch, glances around, then suddenly kneels and puts the package he's carrying to his shoulder. the sound of rapid firing, which makes the newspaper at the end of the packet glow to reveal the barrel of a machine gun. his two companions have also put their packages to their shoulders and begin shooting, all aiming their fire at the schutzpolizei building. the sentry is hit and falls in front of his box. as if these young men have given a signal, now from all over the city comes the sound of gunfire. the pedestrians have scattered except for the old man, gasping for breath, hobbling on his walking stick, who eventually manages to disappear inside a building. rifle and machine gun fire from the schutzpolizei building. the firing intense. the three young poles manoeuvre to the corner opposite the schutzpolizei and toss grenades into the building.}
