<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{jean disappears around the corner.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{three kids in the process of prying a door panel with crowbars. we see that they're removing one of jean's samo pieces from a wall. we read: "pay for soup}
<B>__{build a fort}
<A>__{set it on fire" jean arrives behind them.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{what's up? kid #1 mind your own fuckin' business.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<P>__{(recognizing his work)}
<D>__{that's mine.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{that ain't yours, man. some asshole named samo did this. kid#3 he's dead. that's what i heard. kid #2 he ain't dead yet. he's gonna kill himself. that's why all those art fags in soho are paying more every time we bring one of these in. kid #1 stupid samo... hardly any of this shit left.}
<A>__{the panel is almost pried free without a scratch.}
<D>__{kid #3 this one's damn nice. i say we hang onto it if he's almost dead.}

<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{there you go. now it's worth more.}
<A>__{the kids are outraged, thinking jean's ruined their find. they jump on him. they beat the shit out of him. they're done. jean lies curled up on the ground, trying to talk.}
<D>__{kid #2 what's he saying?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{i'm samo... i'm samo... kid #3}
<P>__{(bending close)}
<D>__{he says he's samo.}
