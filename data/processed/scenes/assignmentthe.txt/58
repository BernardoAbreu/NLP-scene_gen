<L>__{exterior cemetery to abandoned prison montreal day}
<A>__{a camera mounted atop a light fixture pans with jack's car all the way up to the prison entrance. signs on the prison proclaim that it is closed and that trespassing is forbidden. as jack pulls up at the prison, a plainclothed operative comes out and as ramirez and jack pull ramirez's bag out of the car, the operative slips into the driver's side and whisks it away. the ground around the area is full of snow that has not been plowed so the look of desertion is complete.}
