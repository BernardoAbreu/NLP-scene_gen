<L>__{interior technology room corridor}
<A>__{the now four refugees work their way into the final corridor. dark. turns at sharp angles. blind alleys. the floor is uneven, wood aged and twisted. warped by years of water dripping from above. the group strings out as it moves into the darkness, candles held high...}
<B>__{anthony}
<A>__{bringing up the rear, puts his walking stick down snapp!!! everybody stops at the sound.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{what was that?}
<A>__{anthony pulls his stick from the grasp of a }
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{man trap.}
<A>__{they lower their candles. look to:}
<B>__{the floor}
<A>__{interspersed throughout the timbers spring jawed, steel toothed, bear traps. rusted. open. and all around them.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{in case anyone tried to get in and tamper with the technology.}
<A>__{the four of them are standing in the middle of a mine field of man traps. nobody moves.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{what do we do?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{don't move. don't breath.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{we can't just stand here and wait.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{floor's too unstable to try to walk around them.}
<A>__{john pulls a loose board from the corridor wall. turns and kneels at the trap in front of him. pokes the end of the board into the jaws... snap!! the others jump at the sound }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{john what are you doing?}
<A>__{john pulls the stick out of the rusted jaws. moves to the next trap snap!!}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{he's thinking like a leader. everyone: grab wood. spring the traps. clear a path.}
<P>__{(proud of him)}
<D>__{good work, father john.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{brother.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{brother. let's go.}
<A>__{ripley pulls a plank from the wall next to her. exposes a bit of the surface underneath it's metal. she touches the cool, familiar material. smiles. now she knows this is not a dream. she turns and springs the trap in front of her snap!!}
<B>__{the four}
<A>__{slowly make their way down the corridor, one hand holding a candle high, the other poking a piece of wood into the trap in front of them... snap snap...snap. snap. walking carefully around the yet unfired traps....}
<B>__{the door to the technology room}
<A>__{a huge wooden door with no knob or handle. looks like it could almost be part of the wall. john and ripley are the first to it. they put down their planks and begin to feel around the edges of the door for some purchase. the abbot joins them.}
<B>__{back in the corridor}
<A>__{anthony lags behind. he senses a presence in the hallway. hears a sound behind him. we see a glimpse of something he turns towards the sound empty hallway. he thinks. starts forward again with his ear cocked to the rear... snap!}
<B>__{at the door}
<A>__{ripley, john and the abbot knock on the door, walls. ripley leans her head against the wall in frustration and exhaustion. to get this far, and be locked out. she feels sick to her stomach. how long since she had food? she looks over at john. he is staring at her. he turns red at being caught. cute.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i just are you allright?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{tied. without sleep, food i just feel my age.}

<A>__{she wipes her brow and goes back to knocking...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{the wall beneath his fist sounds hollow. fingernails find the edge of the plank and pull the plank slides aside on tiny, rusty pneumatic pistons.}
<B>__{behind the plank}
<A>__{a primitive keyboard. circa late twentieth century.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i think this is it.}
<A>__{ripley and the abbot move over to see.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{technology.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{yeah a hundred years ago. an antique.}

<D>__{go ahead and what?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{open the door, woman.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i will get to it, but listen to me you may dress like you're living in the middle ages but you can't treat me like your chambermaid, or whatever monks had.}
<A>__{up the hall anthony hears the sound again. turns. nothing again. he pauses... turns back quickly the wooden wall moves steps forward }
<B>__{the alien}
<A>__{adapted itself to look like wood. it's body changes transmutes cable like sinew snaking over grained limbs to approximate the more traditional bio mechnoid alien appearance...!}
<B>__{anthony pov}
<A>__{the weary android sees the alien as a conglommoration of his many medieval images of demons. he hears the alien's hollow, raspy breath. it glides towards him... anthony steps back directly into a trap as his mind goes snap!! the steel jaws spring shut on his left ankle. milky blood fluid starts to flow. he finds himself in the same predicament as his vision ankle pinned, the alien's appendages circling him he screams. aaaaaaaaaaaargh !}
<B>__{at the door}
<A>__{ripley is trying to work. she punches numbers into the keyboard. she is too exhausted to see straight. they hear the scream john runs back traps snapping around him ripley turns towards the sound the abbot pushes her back to the keyboard }

<D>__{open it!!}
<A>__{ripley knits her brows. forces herself to focus. her fingers punch the keys.}
<B>__{the alien}
<A>__{steps towards anthony snap snap snap ap !! traps snap closed on its tail, its legs halfway down the hall john snap!! his cassock is snagged in a trap. he tears right out of it }
<B>__{at the end of the hall}
<A>__{anthony is in the clutches of the alien. he whacks at the beast with his staff, but his blows fall like drops of rain on an elephant. the alien lifts him up to face him. anthony screams as his left leg is stretched agsinst the tension of the trap's chain blood pouring as white ribbons from his almost severed ankle.}
<B>__{face to face with the alien}
<A>__{anthony drops his staff and grabs each of the alien's arms with his own android arms. his extra human strength keeps them from squeezing him any tighter, but he cannot avert his gaze from the smooth, eyeless face. the alien considers him. its thin, almost translucent lips pull back to reveal rows of splinter like teeth. the jaws spread, making room for the distended tongue: the alien hisses puts out anthony's eyes with a thin stream of acidic saliva artificial skin bubbles and blisters }
<B>__{john}
<A>__{picks up anthony's staff. begins to flail away at the demon.}
<B>__{at the door}
<A>__{ripley is getting no response from the keyboard.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{what's wrong?!}
<A>__{ripley slides the keyboard out of the wall compartment. the wires are so old they've broken.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{she bites the ends off the wires spits out the insulation. twists the bare wire ends together... sweat runs into her eyes.}
<B>__{john}
<A>__{whacks the alien with anthony's staff again. again. the creature will not let anthony go. the android writhes in its grasp, his face now a blistered, pulpy mass, eyes gone.}
<B>__{ripley}
<A>__{finishes hot wiring. the keyboard hums to life. her fingers fly across the keys }
<B>__{the alien}
<A>__{tail wraps around john's waist pulls him towards it lifts him turns him upside down lips pull back john's hands grope at the floor sharp metal teeth spread }
<B>__{the door keyboard}
<A>__{lights: code accepted ripley's head whips towards the corridor }
<B>__{john}
<A>__{his hand closes around the end of one of the traps he brings it up snap!! it slams closed on the alien's extended tongue ! the beast bellows!! whips its head from side to side can't shake off the trap acid blood sprays out ! lands as pools of fire on the wooden floor.}
<B>__{the door}
<A>__{opens with a strained blast of dust see whorcssh! the abbot leaps inside }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{it's open!!}
<B>__{john}
<A>__{pries anthony's ankle out of his trap. scoops up his staff, drags the moaning android back up the corridor }

<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{hurry }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hurry!!}
<B>__{the alien}
<A>__{yards away limping. hissing.}
<B>__{angry. the keyboard}
<A>__{acceptance tone "bings." the door starts to slide down the alien is feet away }
<B>__{inches...}
<A>__{the door seats itself closed with a solid thud. ripley, panting, rests eyes closed against the rough wooden door. a beat. she turns to the room for the first time and finds }
<B>__{windmills}
<A>__{real man of lamancha wood and cloth windmills. two story high arms slowly rotating. moving enormous volumes of air through the wind tunnel like room. as far as the eye can see. turning, creaking.}
<B>__{whoosh...whoosh...}
<A>__{but no electronics. no radio. no weapons. this is the technology room. ripley collapses to the floor and loses consciousness.}
