<A>__{ash enters from the hallway and turns his head to the sound. main room night ash's pov the rocking chair it rocks back and forth with a definitive motion, halting for a moment at it's pints furthest forward and backward, as if some invisible thing was sitting there and rocking. close shot ash he slowly approaches the chair, scared shitless. medium shot from behind the rocking chair the chair rocks in and out of frame in the foreground as ash takes halting steps towards it. ash gathers his courage and reaches out his hand to halt the rocking motion. slowly his hand approaches the chair. just as his hand goes to touch it, the chair abruptly halts, on its own accord. medium shot ash in a confused state as he backs away from the chair and into the wall. he turns and comes face to face with himself in a hanging framed mirror. he clutches at his face, trying to reassure himself of his sanity.}
