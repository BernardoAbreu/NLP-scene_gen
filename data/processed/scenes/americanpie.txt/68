<A>__{oz and heather are singing with the group, at opposite ends of the room. it's a pop, contemporary arrangement of "how sweet it is." it sounds jazzy, cool. oz looks dazed, like the wind's taken out of him. he sings along, distant. heather, almost defiantly, sings clearer and better than ever. oz watches her, though she never looks his way. at the bride of the song, heather breaks into a solo. she sings beautifully. oz is hooked. the choir teacher halts the song.}
<C>__{choir teacher}
<D>__{okay, heather, that was good, but i want to thicken up that solo. michigan state is this saturday, and i want that part to smoke .}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{i know, my timing's off.}
<C>__{choir teacher}
<D>__{a little, but i think it'll work better as a duet. with a tenor part.}
<C>__{oz}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i will do it.}
<A>__{a beat as the choir teacher is impressed and heather looks indifferent.}
<C>__{oz }
<D>__{i will do it.}
<C>__{choir teacher}
<D>__{okay then. the rest of you okay with that?}
<A>__{the rest of the choir agrees, as heather looks to oz with skepticism.}
<C>__{choir teacher }
<D>__{great. see you tomorrow.}
<A>__{the group starts packing up.}
<C>__{heather}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{because i want to.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{yeah? well you can't fake your way through this. you better practice.}
<A>__{she leaves.}
