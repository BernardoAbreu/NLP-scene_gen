<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{prew and galovitch are standing in front of the captain's desk. prew is at attention, the heavy pack on his back; his face is drawn and tired; his clothes are plastered to him. he has regained his old expressionless look. warden has swung his chair around and is surveying the scene. holmes looks prew up and down, half smiles.}
