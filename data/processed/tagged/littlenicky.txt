<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior suburbia night}
<A>__{a beautiful late summer night. crickets chirping, sprinklers sprinkling. we pan across one particular lawn, up one particular tree, where we see the peeper (jon lovitz) sitting on a limb. he has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a walkman. suddenly the lights turn on.}
<C>__{peeper}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{showtime!}
<A>__{we see a young mother walk into the room outside the peeper's window. she is wearing business attire.}
<C>__{peeper }
<D>__{rough day at the office mrs. dunleavy?}
<P>__{(takes bite of sandwich)}
<D>__{well you'll feel better once you slip off those work clothes and get into some sweats.}
<A>__{the mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing her feet.}
<C>__{peeper }
<D>__{oh my g d, yes! i wish you would let me rub those feet. of course i wouldn't use my hands. heh heh heh heh...}
<A>__{he sips some wine. the mother starts to unbutton her blouse. she takes it off, revealing a nice bra.}
<C>__{peeper }
<D>__{looks like victoria just told me her secret.}
<A>__{the peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook. mouthing the words as he goes.}
<C>__{peeper }
<D>__{thursday the ninth, eight thirty p.m., first brassiere sighting...}
<P>__{(stops writing)}
<D>__{i will pleasure myself to this image for months. months i tell you!}
<A>__{the mother starts to unbutton her pants. her young son walks in wearing a scouts uniform.}
<C>__{peeper }
<D>__{young scottie dunleavy. what unfortunate timing. you mother was just getting comfy.}
<A>__{the son talks to his mother excitedly.}
<C>__{peeper }
<D>__{yes, yes, i'm sure you tied many great knots today or whatever. now get out.}
<A>__{the son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair.}
<C>__{peeper }
<D>__{now what. this simply won't do.}
<A>__{the peeper takes out a cell phone and dials. the son answers.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{peeper}
<D>__{hello, scottie. why don't you go downstairs like a good boy and let your mother freshen up.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{who is this?}
<C>__{peeper}
<D>__{just a little birdie. a birdie who wants to see if your mother's panties match her bra.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{oh my g d scottie. is there a man up our tree?}
<A>__{the peeper gets nervous.}
<C>__{peeper}
<D>__{tell her no. tell her it's just a big bird.}
<A>__{the peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises. we see scottie with his sling shot. the mother nods yes. he shoots it. it hits the peeper square in the head. he falls to the ground with a thud.}
<C>__{peeper }
<D>__{mrs. dunleavy, please come help me. and wear your bikini.}
<A>__{the peeper looks up. he sees scottie pushing a television out the window. it lands on top of the peeper. he's dead.}
<T>__{hard cut:}
<L>__{interior hole day}
<A>__{the peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on all sides. the peeper is falling down, down, down. the whole way screaming like a five year old girl. peeper's pov we see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire. he}
<B>__{screams.}
<L>__{exterior fire gates of hell}
<A>__{we see the gate wall of flames. we hear screaming. wham! we see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in a heap in a shallow pit of coals. dazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the fire wall at different levels. (note: all the arrivals clothes are now burned & shredded).}
<C>__{gatekeeper }
<D>__{welcome!}
<A>__{the peeper looks left to see the gatekeeper standing at his station greeting the new souls with mock cheer.}
<C>__{peeper}
<D>__{am i in hell?}
<C>__{gatekeeper}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{a giant bird appears and bites the peeper's crotch area. we leave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to...}
<B>__{matte painting hell}
<A>__{music up: "running with the devil" by van halen the vast and insane kingdom of hell. a road leads toward it like the yellow brick road only with fire and coals. we see the black castle in the distance. the camera zooms into the castle, to one particular window.}
<L>__{interior nicky's room day}
<A>__{looks like an american teenager's room models, a dresser, heavy metal posters (tons of ozzy stuff) everywhere (but no bed devils don't sleep). nicky is air guitaring to the song. over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled "nicky's monster metal mix." the head demon, jimmy the demon, opens the door, scaring nicky who falls backward into the table, breaking it.}
<C>__{nicky}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{hey...}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{okay, but jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!}
<L>__{interior black palace throne room day}
<A>__{adrian and cassius are playing darts. they're aiming for people's faces that are coming through the wall.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{i knew it. he's finally retiring.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{i've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.}
<A>__{he throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead.}
<C>__{human dartboard}
<D>__{aaaah!}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{if the old man picks me to take over hell, i will keep the torture going twenty four seven. no breaks.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{well dad says it's the breaks that make the torture. you have to let people feel a sense of relief.}
<A>__{cassius whips a dart which hits one of the human dartboards in the eye.}
<C>__{human dartboard}
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaaaah!}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{then again, the beauty of dad retiring is what he says doesn't matter anymore.}
<A>__{cassius pulls out the dart. the eye comes with it.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{i will take that.}
<A>__{cassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it. thwack! it splatters like a grape.}
<C>__{human dartboard}
<D>__{was that really necessary?}
<A>__{nicky enters sheepishly.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{hey, how's daddy's little girl doing today?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{good, thanks.}
<A>__{cassius snaps his fingers in nicky's face.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{hey. hey. hey. wanna mind wrestle?}
<A>__{cassius' eyes start glowing red.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{actually, i will take a rain check on0}
<A>__{nicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible force.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{got ya!}
<C>__{nicky}
<P>__{(picking up his head)}
<D>__{yes, you got me...}
<A>__{nicky's head slams back down again.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{got ya, again!}
<C>__{nicky}
<P>__{(picking head up)}
<D>__{got me for sure, yes...}
<A>__{he grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the head.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{got ya! now here's the big finish...}
<A>__{nicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his own crotch.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{oh no. please cassius...}
<A>__{nicky's hand is being possessed. it gets closer and closer until it latches on to nicky's crotch.}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{aaaaah.}
<A>__{cassius concentrates even harder, making nicky twist his own hand. nicky screams even louder. adrian smiles. they don't notice that dad, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small devil horns), enters behind them.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{what are you boys doing?}
<A>__{cassius releases nicky's hand.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{nothing, dad. just re arranging the furniture.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{cassius, didn't i tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{i forgot.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{maybe this will help you remember.}
<A>__{dad's eyes flash red and cassius punches himself hard in the nose, sending him back against the wall and down to the floor. dad gives nicky a wink. nicky smiles. dad has an air of confidence and power.}
<C>__{dad }
<D>__{now everybody sit down.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{hey, dad, i'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. i really think it's a masterpiece.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.}
<A>__{he leads the boys to the throne area. we see outside the window the peeper staring in sexily. dad looks, shakes his head. just then, the bird appears and attacks him. dad closes the curtains. nicky, adrian and cassius sit on little stools at the foot of his throne. dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip of which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at his three sons.}
<C>__{dad }
<D>__{my dad, your granddad, lucifer, was thrown out of heaven by g d and rules here in hell for ten thousand years. and after this ten thousand years had passed, he decided to abdicate his throne...}
<A>__{confused, nicky sheepishly raises his hand.}
<C>__{dad }
<D>__{...to step aside.}
<P>__{(nicky lowers his hand)}
<D>__{...and let me become the ruler of hell. this, as some of you might know, is my ten thousandth year as prince of darkness. so i think the time has come to discuss who will succeed me.}
<A>__{jimmy the demon walks in.}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{knock, knock.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{yes, jimmy.}
<A>__{he whispers in dad's ear.}
<C>__{dad }
<D>__{no, no, that's not what i said. he can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<P>__{(turning to leave)}
<D>__{oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up hitler's ass at four o'clock.}
<A>__{dad nods, and jimmy shuffles out. dad turns his attention back to his sons.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{this was a very difficult decision, because i have three wonderful sons. i mean, adrian, so smart, so ruthless. and cassius, so strong, so tough. and nicky, so...so...}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{don't worry about coming up with anything. it's cool.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{such a sweet boy. but after much thought and careful consideration, i've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be...me.}
<C>__{cassius and adrian}
<P>__{(dumbfounded)}
<D>__{what!?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{hallelujah.}
<A>__{they all look at nicky.}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{i mean...tough break.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{the important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. and i don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. you need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{dad! this is hoyashit.}
<A>__{dad glares. cassius goes flying back. one of the human dartboards laughs. cassius whips a dart and hits him in the tongue. jimmy enters and points at his watch.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{right. right. send him in.}
<P>__{(to the boys)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, boys. i've got to get back to work.}
<A>__{nicky, cassius and adrian start filing out. adrian stops.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{you sure about this decision, dad?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i'm telling you, pal, it's the right thing to do.}
<A>__{hitler (in a french maid's outfit), is being brought in by jimmy. they head towards the closet. inside the closet is a crate of pineapples. hitler picks out a relatively small one. dad shakes his head "no." dad walks over to the closet. hitler picks out a really big pineapple. dad nods "yes." hitler sadly hands it to dad. jimmy bends hitler over and as dad raises the fruit... close on hitler's eyes as the pineapple's jammed up his ass.}
<C>__{hitler}
<D>__{holy schnit!!}
<L>__{exterior highway to hell day}
<A>__{cassius and adrian are standing by the road still flowing with souls. both are pissed. there's a big, ugly, bigfoot looking monster hanging out with them, kind of nodding along.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{you work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{and he's dead serious.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{it's just such a slap in the face.}
<A>__{adrian turns to the monster.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{yeah, get out of here! beat it!}
<A>__{cassius insanely snaps his fingers in the monster's face. the monster shrugs and walks off.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{twenty thousand years ago, grandpa lucifer said, "it is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven." well, i'm getting tired of serving in hell. we need a place where we can rule.}
<A>__{cassius throws a rock at the monster. he yelps, then turns around, motioning like he's thinking about coming back. cassius sees this and gets enraged.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{oh you wanna be a big man? bring it on!! let's see what you got!}
<A>__{the monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in an "aw phooey" gesture and continues walking away.}
<C>__{cassius }
<D>__{that's what i thought!}
<C>__{adrian}
<P>__{(to cassius)}
<D>__{could you concentrate for five seconds?}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{i am concentrating. where can we rule?}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{what do you think about...earth?}
<A>__{cassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea.}
<C>__{adrian }
<D>__{we could create our own hell there.}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{you saying we go up there and kill everyone?}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{eventually, cassius. but first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...}
<C>__{cassius}
<D>__{...their damned souls will be ours.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{it's our time, brother.}
<A>__{the two look at each other. they start running toward the fire wall. knocking souls out of their way.}
<C>__{gatekeeper}
<D>__{hey, what are you doing?!?}
<A>__{they get closer to the fire.}
<C>__{gatekeeper }
<D>__{you can't go through there. the fire flows in, not out.}
<A>__{they dive through the fire wall. it freezes.}
<C>__{gatekeeper }
<D>__{you know something? you guys suck! you really suck!}
<A>__{sirens go off. dogs start barking. lights flash. and we hear the sound of damned souls hitting the back of the firewall hard.}
<L>__{interior throne room shortly after}
<A>__{dad and nicky are listening to one of nicky's metal mix tapes. we hear the end of pink floyd's "comfortably numb." pause. dad exhales.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{now that was an experience. "you are only coming through in waves." that line blows my mind every time.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{definitely.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. when it's over, that mood has been altered. wow. great shit. what's next?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{well, i thought that after messing with your head, i'd give you a little kick in the keester.}
<A>__{hits the tape player. "enter sandman" blasts.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{who is this, metal lick a?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{metallica, dad. come on.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i was just playing with you.}
<A>__{dad and nicky dance to the song.}
<L>__{interior throne room later}
<B>__{close on dad.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i'm sorry. after careful consideration, i regretfully have to decline.}
<A>__{on person he's talking to: dan marino.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{c'mon, man, i'm just asking for one superbowl ring.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{in exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? you're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, mr. marino.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{you did it for namath.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{yeah, but joe was coming here anyways. just go back to earth and enjoy your records and the hall of fame and the beautiful family and all that.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{this is bullshit, man.}
<P>__{(gets up to leave)}
<D>__{i'm gonna win the superbowl this year, with or without you!}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{now you're talking.}
<A>__{dan exits.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you're a good devil, dad.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{and i also happen to be a jets fan.}
<A>__{nicky and dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint sirens. the gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his knees.}
<C>__{gatekeeper}
<D>__{your highness, cassius and adrian have escaped from hell. they went through the fire, and they broke it. i think they took the new york tunnel. i tried to stop them, but they overpowered me, sir.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{oh, boy. oh boy. calm down. get off your knees.}
<A>__{the gatekeeper stands up.}
<C>__{gatekeeper}
<D>__{thanks for being so understanding, your worship. you're the man. you've always been the man.}
<A>__{dad's eyes glow red as the gatekeeper stands up. two huge boobs grow out of either side of the gatekeeper's head. we only see them from the front for a second. from behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the nipples as he talks to nicky.}
<C>__{gatekeeper }
<P>__{(to nicky)}
<D>__{i'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{coulda been much worse.}
<C>__{gatekeeper}
<D>__{that's what i'm thinkin'...}
<A>__{dad is staring off. he looks shaken.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{this is bad, nicky.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{how bad?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i'm gonna die, nicky. if the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means i will start to deteriorate into nothing.}
<A>__{grandpa lucifer enters.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{what's with all the whoo whoo noises?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{everything's fine, pop.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{last time you said that the renaissance happened.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{please, pop, just go back to your room.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<P>__{(regarding gateskeeper)}
<D>__{can i take him with me and have sex with his head?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{sure, pop. whatever you want.}
<A>__{the gatekeeper walks towards lucifer.}
<C>__{gatekeeper}
<D>__{oh, this is gonna be a whole new lifestyle for me, isn't it.}
<L>__{exterior gates of hell shortly after}
<A>__{we see the coals are cooling down on the road and the damned souls in hell are sneaking off. the demons are baffled and don't quite know what to do. dad, jimmy and nicky walk to the frozen fire.}
<C>__{damned souls }
<D>__{what's going on? where are we?}
<A>__{we keep hearing people hit behind the frozen fire with loud thuds.}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{nothing's getting through that. the fire is solid as a rock.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{we gotta get this bad boy burning again. ideas?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{to do that cassius and adrian have to come back through the other way.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{so go get 'em, dad!}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i'm too weak. the process has already begun.}
<A>__{dad holds up his hand. his pink is hanging by a thread. we see the bigfoot monster grunt disgusted by the sight.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{so go get 'em, jimmy!}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{i'm just a demon, nicky. i don't got devil blood in me. i'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you're not saying it's up to me?}
<A>__{the monster puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as if to say, "oh no."}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{i've never been to earth. i've never even slept over at some other dude's house!}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{you're the spawn of satan. you got it in you.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{nicky, the worst thing that could happen on earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{are you telling me i have to go to earth and kill my brothers?}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{not go. they left together at the exact same time. they gotta come back together at the exact same time.}
<A>__{dad takes an ornate flask from his robe.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{here. get them drunk from this. one sip and they'll be trapped inside. once you've got both of them, you bring the flask back through the gate.}
<A>__{dad's pinky is hanging. jimmy pulls it off and examines it. the monster gags.}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{your ol' man's got less than a week.}
<A>__{nicky looks petrified.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{no. this can't be happening.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{son, just do your best.}
<A>__{nicky looks teary eyed. the moment is broken by the monster, who runs in and pushes nicky through the fire. nicky goes through the solid fire wall. pause. the monster taps his own wrist and looks at dad as if to say, "gotta get a move on."}
<L>__{interior grand central station platform day}
<A>__{a sign: 42nd st. grand central pan down to the darkened bowels of the old station, between two tracks, to a putrid puddle. nicky breaks through the surface, sputtering. we hear a rumbling in the near distance.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{okay. earth. the blue marble. this doesn't look too bad.}
<A>__{nicky sees a fast approaching light, furrows his brow and whammm!}
<D>__{exterior gates of hell moments later}
<A>__{nicky comes shooting through the solid fire wall and lands in the coal pit. his dad limps back to him.}
<C>__{jimmy the demon}
<D>__{you were gone ten seconds. what happened?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{that's a train, son. don't stand in front of them.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{well, i guess i'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{please, nicky, get back up there.}
<P>__{(his ear falls off)}
<D>__{try to hurry.}
<A>__{nicky climbs up and heads back toward the fire wall.}
<L>__{interior grand central station platform day}
<A>__{nicky makes it back through the hole. looks both ways and hops out of the hole. he carefully crosses the tracks and is stopped by the sight of a bulldog, beefy, on the other side. in his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to identify their passengers at the airport. on the sign is scrawled "nicky." nicky and beefy stare at each other a beat.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i'm nicky.}
<A>__{beefy drops the sign from his mouth.}
<C>__{beefy}
<P>__{(voice of sandy wernick)}
<D>__{hey, terrific!! now get off the track and come with me, shitstains.}
<L>__{interior grand central station pavillion day}
<A>__{the throng of commuters making their way through the terminal are giving a wide berth to the filthy man who's looking around suspiciously, talking to the dog.}

<D>__{my name's beefy. i'm an old friend of your father's. he's asked me to help you out.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i just need to find my brothers and be on my way, beefy.}
<C>__{beefy}
<D>__{it's not gonna be easy. your brothers can possess people. so they probably won't look like themselves. you have to be suspicious of everyone.}
<A>__{nicky looks at beefy warily for a beat.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{okay, "bro," this jig is up...}
<P>__{(pulling out the flask)}
<D>__{just get in the bottle. just slide right on in there.}

<D>__{oh. sorry.}

<P>__{(running away)}
<D>__{the devil walks among us!}

<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{yes. what is rent?}

<D>__{eight hundred, split down the middle. tuesdays and thursdays i rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{off limits.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{right. and as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60 40. cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.}

<A>__{we hear the bells toll. we see the beautiful exterior of a large church.}

<C>__{cardinal}
<D>__{in today's gospel, the lord tells us who we are to live if we wish to attain the splendor of heaven... or something like that. jesus sure says a lot of stuff in the bible. moses this. moses that. abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.}
<A>__{the crowd stares dumbfounded. we see that the cardinal is standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box with the top open.}
<C>__{cardinal }
<D>__{yep, the lord sure did say a bunch of hibbity jibbity. but has he ever really done anything for us? has he ever put a jaguar xjr in my driveway? has he ever given any of my enemies the herpes? no. he hasn't done a damn thing for any of us.}

<D>__{middle aged woman the lord gave my son the strength to get off drugs.}

<D>__{no, your best friend fitzie helped your wife conceive a baby. he helped her conceive it all night long.}
<A>__{fitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the wife, starts to "raise the roof." then thinks better of it. the cardinal points to a well dressed man in the front pew.}

<A>__{the mayor has tinfoil on his feet.}
<C>__{mayor}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{well, i wish i could think of something, cardinal, but to be honest with you, i can't. kind of makes you wonder if there even is a lord. if there is any ultimate punishment for our so called "sins." maybe we should all just have fun and do whatever the hell we want.}
<A>__{a hubbub is raised by the crowd. fitzie raises the roof again, this time energetically.}
<C>__{cardinal}
<D>__{amen to that. let the sin begin!}
<A>__{the hubbub grows to a roar. several people start fighting over the money in the collection plate. the cardinal smiles knowingly at the mayor. we hear the cardinal's thoughts in adrian's voice.}
