<C>__{answering machine}
<D>__{you have no new messages.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{if you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose. and when it comes to money, finding it and losing it, you always gotta remember how much of it's just luck...}
<A>__{jake stands his sparse little world, addressing the quiet before he fishes for his wallet, which he can't find.}
<C>__{lily }
<D>__{oops.}
<A>__{the realization makes jake smile. then a flapping sound spins him around to see a pigeon, flapping up against the inside of a partially opened window. visibly upset by the bird, jake moves towards the window and pushes it wide, allowing the bird to escape.}

<D>__{dumb fucking luck.}
<A>__{jake stares out the window after the bird.}
