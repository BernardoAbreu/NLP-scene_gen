<L>__{interior niki's car day}
<A>__{niki gives it everything he's got. tearing through the gears, trying to catch james hunt, breaking as late as he can, engine screaming. he flies over the take off hump between pflanzgarten and swallowtail passes one car after another. into 13th place now. pulling off outrageous manoeuvres. niki's p.o.v: the world flies past in a blur. the steering wheel shakes. the car is right on the edge. cannot be driven any harder. niki approaches the streckenteil adenauer brucke section of the course...turns left at the bergwerk corner. crazy speed. and tight. too tight. a mistake... "thump", his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the inside. niki tries to counter steer, but is travelling at 155 mph. the car jerks horribly to the right.. "crunch", hits the embankment, then "bang", hits the barrier, and is thrown across the track.. fire breaks out in the engine. niki's eyes widen in horror, with another car bearing down upon him...}

<D>__{no...!}
<A>__{the oncoming car crashes head on into our car, "crash", a sickening, terrifying impact. the car explodes. seventy litres of burning high octane gasoline, with niki strapped inside, unable to undo his seatbelt. locked in a blast furnace. niki screams as the flames engulf him. 800 degrees temperature. trapped inside his car. burning smoke fills his helmet, scarring his lungs... pandemonium: commentary in different languages as panicked tv commentators helplessly describe what's happening.. niki's pov: he can just make out the barely recognizable figures of the other drivers rushing towards niki.. their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully to undo niki's seatbelt.. fire extinguishers blast at the car. dry powder extinguishers. covering niki's helmet. blurring his vision, as he cries out in agony, inhaling the powder.. screaming voices. panicked reactions. on the side of the car, the painted name `niki lauda' blisters and melts. then sound fades. as niki blacks out losing consciousness.}
