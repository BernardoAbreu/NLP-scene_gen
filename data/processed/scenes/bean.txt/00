<A>__{a very grand room, with lots of wood and some very famous portraits round the walls. a group of grave gentlemen and gentlewomen. they are the trustees of the national gallery. lord walton, a very grand man, sits at the table head. to his right sits his assistant, gareth. all are deep in thought. lord walton fidgets with a pencil on the table. he raises his head as though about to speak. everyone looks up expectantly. and... lord walton goes back to fidgeting. so does everyone else.}
