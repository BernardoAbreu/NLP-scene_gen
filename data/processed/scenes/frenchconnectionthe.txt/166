<A>__{in the background, the scene is being duplicated by two or three others. overhead view of this headlight and flashlight arena of about 10 or 12 detectives forming small clusters, throwing these guys up against cars, pulling their arms around behind them and throwing cuffs on them while others rapidly frisk them for weapons, taking away one pistol, a couple of knives. mulderig and doyle looking at their man up against the lincoln as russo finishes snapping handcuffs on him.}

<D>__{of all the goddam cars they had to pick to steal hubcaps.}
<A>__{close shot of the front end of the lincoln, upended on a hoist attached to a police tow truck. the area is less brightly lighted by headlights now. some cars have departed with the puerto rican auto strippers. doyle's interest focuses on the car. we pick him up as we pan to him sitting on the running board of the tow truck, talking with its driver, who is making a report on a clipboard. mulderig and russo are standing nearby, talking to two plainclothesmen.}
