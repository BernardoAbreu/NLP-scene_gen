<D>__{lord knows the will of a man gets tested. cruelly most times. but the righteous persevere. they do what needs to be done, even though they don't want to. it's what makes a man, a man. let me tell you the story of judas, he was one of jesus's apostles. judas led roman soldiers to the capture and eventual death of our lord jesus christ. and now, is supposedly seated next to satan, his soul burning in hell forever for this sin. but i don't believe that's the case. i have my own theory. the death of jesus was predicted thousands of years before judas ever came along. and for the prophecy to be fulfilled, jesus had to die. if he didn't, the gates of heaven couldn't be opened for mankind. i don't think, for an instant, judas wanted to be the one, but... someone had to. judas helped jesus, so jesus could die for our sins. save us all. and i believe at this moment... judas is in heaven, despite his sin, because it led to the greater good.}
