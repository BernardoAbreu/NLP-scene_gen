<L>__{exterior cyberspace transition}
<A>__{light speed thrill ride, hurling into digital chaos. rush's electrified body hurtles across the void, eyes filled with terror and awe.}
<T>__{transforms to:}
<L>__{exterior cyberspace x net central server}
<A>__{shimmering bits morph into an awesome cyberscape. rush enters this bizarre world crash flash stranger in a strange land. data energy zaps off his body, interacting with the landscape circuitry around him. he fights it, tries to control it. rush stands, beholds the place. looks at his hands and arms, clad in circuitry. he finds he had landed outside: fortress like x net central server. alarms sounding inside. he turns, looks up a firewall. hundreds of x takk troops hurry to look down. firing weapons. a figure comes at him, down the wall, streaking red. blammo! tron lands on a plateau above rush, gazing down. they face each other, equally perplexed. rush is no longer human, but not quite a program either. energy zaps off his body, infusing the surrounding circuitry. tron stares, unblinking cyber ninja.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{it's you! the intruder!}
<A>__{rush's body circuits pulse with anger data surges out his feet, across floor circuitry, up to the plateau. energy interacts with tron's body circuits, siphoning off bits of code. code races across rush's eyes. identification data.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{you are... tron?!?}
<A>__{x takks hustle onto the scene. tron leaps off the plateau, cutting the data connection. he whips his disk off his back and throws. disk slams rush in the gut, knocks him flat.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{arrrghh!}
<A>__{x takks pursue tron tron recovers his disk vanishes in an outbound data stream, losing his pursuers. x takks pull rush to his feet, shocked.}
<D>__{x takk 1 rx23?! x takk 2 but... you crashed irrecoverably!}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{uh, well, i'm not exactly x takk 3 rx23 has been rebooted!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{rx23 reboot was not authorized!}
<A>__{pushing through police: a sleek, smart cyber babe mega. (she's meg's cyber twin: twice the edge, half the patience, all the curves.) rush is awed by the sight of her.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{yow. i know who programmed you.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{i am mega, x net intelligence.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{mega. cool. i am }
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{a spy? posing as rx23? under which register were you rebooted?}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{i'm a user.}
<A>__{mega and x takks look at him like he's crazy.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{detain this impostor.}
<A>__{x takks move to seize rush.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{no wait, look. we're on the same side here. i got an id on the intruder!}
<A>__{mega touches rush, exciting his energy flow. she reads data streaming in his eyes tron's id info.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{"tron"? x takk 2 how did he get that??}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{plexor must know of this!}
