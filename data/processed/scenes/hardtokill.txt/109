<L>__{interior vestibule day}
<A>__{storm poised inside the front door .45 in hand. in walks ... andy! she nearly faints at the sight of the pistol leveled between her eyes. storm instantly jerks the weapon back. they stand there staring at each other.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{martha's dead.}
<A>__{storm takes andy in his arms. she weeps, sobbing. feeling all the tension and terror of the past days yet somehow knowing she's safe in the arms of this man she loves.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i won't leave you. not ever again.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{i won't let you.}
<A>__{storm holds her, knowing he loves her.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{o'malley was here.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{here? how did you find him?}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{you found him. the old lady was his mother.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and andy ... my son's alive.}
<A>__{andy raises her face to storm's, her eyes welling with emotion. he kisses her. they are standing there, just inside the front door, which has a wood bottom half and a frosted glass top half. suddenly: storm jerks andy sideways into the room with all his strength! he dives with her as the top of the front door explodes inward in a shower of flying glass! boom! boom! boom! three more point blank shotogun blasts blow the rest of the door to hell. angle hallway storm hurls andy so hard and fast it looks like she will land in pieces. he somehow ends up in front of her on the floor as a masked man plunges through the front door into the hallway, shotgun spinning to cover his advance. too late. we hear two loud rounds and the masked man's head snaps violently back and he falls into a pile.}
