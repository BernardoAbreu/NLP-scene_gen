<L>__{interior senate building, amidala's apartment, bedroom night}
<A>__{padme is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. artoo stands in the corner of the bedroom. his power is off.}
<L>__{interior senate building, amidala's apartment, main r0om night}
<A>__{anakin is standing in the living room. he is in a meditative state. it is quiet. we hear distant footsteps in the corridor outside the apartment. suddenly anakin's eyes pop open. his eyes dart around the room. he reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt. the door to the apartment slides open, and obi wan enters.}
<D>__{obi wan captain typho has more than enough men downstairs. no assassin will try that way. any activity up here?}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{quiet as a tomb. i don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.}
<A>__{obi wan checks a palm sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. it shows a shot of artoo by the door, but no sign of padme on the bed.}
<D>__{obi wan what's going on?}
<A>__{anakin shrugs.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{she covered that camera. i don't think she liked me watching her. obi wan what is she thinking?}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{she programmed artoo to warn us if there's an intruder. obi wan it's not an intruder i'm worried about. there are many other ways to kill a senator.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i know, but we also want to catch this assassin. don't we, master? obi wan you're using her as bait??}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{it was her idea... no harm will come to her. i can sense everything going on in that room. trust me. obi wan it's too risky... and your senses aren't that attuned, young apprentice.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{and yours are? obi wan possibly.}
