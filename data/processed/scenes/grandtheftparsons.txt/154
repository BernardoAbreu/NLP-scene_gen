<A>__{the hearse roars away and the cop watches it go.}
<L>__{interior barbara's car. day}
<A>__{barbara drives and susie sits in the passenger seat. it doesn't look as if they've spoken for hours.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{if you hate phil so much, why are you chasing him across california?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{he's got gram and i need him.}
<T>__{con tinue d:}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{well, that's really touching. but... you've got to come to terms with the fact that he's dead.}
<A>__{barbara shoots her a withering look.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i know he's dead, honey. but he hasn't been officially identified, and there's no certificate of death.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{let's just say i'm overly sentimental, okay?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{this is all about money, isn't it?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{isn't everything?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{why do you think you deserve anything?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i was a great support to gram before kaufman came along and spoiled the party.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{phil's not responsible for your problems with gram.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{what do you know?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{i know that he can be a pain in the ass, but when it came to gram, phil only ever did the right thing.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{in his whole life, phil kaufman didn't do anything because it was the right thing to do. you can bet the ranch that wherever he is, he's having some fun.}
<A>__{con tinue d: (2)}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{maybe that's what i like about him.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{sure it is, honey. that's why your bags were packed.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{have you any idea what it's like to really love someone?}
<A>__{barbara laughs.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you might exclusively love phil kaufman but unfortunately, so does he. you're just handy to have around.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{i don't have to listen to this.}
<A>__{susie leans over, grabs the safety brake and pulls it up hard. the car swerves and skids to a stop.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{okay, you vindictive bitch. i'm going with you to joshua tree because my life seems to have been turned upside down and i want to know why. but you don't know me and i won't let you judge me. do it again and i will smash that pretty little face of yours off the fucking road. got it?}
<A>__{barbara dismisses her anger with a tight little smile.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{the truth can hurt, can't it?}
