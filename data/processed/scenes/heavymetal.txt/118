<A>__{all is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and barren desert. the silence is broken by a whistling sound which gets louder and louder. then, thud! a green ball lands in the dirt in front of us. fluttering down around it are hanover fiste's tattered clothes. then the burnt ashes of hanover's body land in a small pile beside his clothes. panning up we see taarna flying on her bird in the distance.}
