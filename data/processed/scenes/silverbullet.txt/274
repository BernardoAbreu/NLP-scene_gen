<A>__{what we see is a tiny boy in a tiny wheelchair moving along a dark, empty ribbon of road under a vast dome of stars. distant sound: the bullet's engine.}
<L>__{exterior a roadside turnout night}
<A>__{sound: fast rushing water. the turnout is packed dirt. there's a grove of trees with picnic tables spotted among them at the back. the sign in the extreme f.g. reads roadside rest area at the top; auger falls in the middle; township of tarker's mills at the bottom. sound: the silver bullet approaching. marty turns in and rolls to the back of the rest area. he stops by one of the picnic tables and dumps the bag of fireworks out onto the picnic table and takes his time selecting the first he's like a wine fancier with a whole cellar of rare bottles to choose from. at last he chooses a twizzer. he takes matches from the pocket of his pajama top and lights the fuse. when it starts to fizz, marty tosses it high into the air.}
