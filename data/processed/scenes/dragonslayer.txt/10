<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{dragon country night the moon shines down on the far reaches of the kingdom of urland, coldly lighting a barren landscape filled with the skeletons of dead trees, blackened rock and bare ground. advancing across this mournful terrain is a troop of armed men leading a blindfolded horse and tumbril. the horse is skittish. finally, in spite of shouts and lashings, it refuses to go further. the leader, horsrik, barks out an order:}
<C>__{horsrik}
<D>__{close enough! bring her out!}
<A>__{a young woman, no more than seventeen, is brought forth from the cart. long black hair falls down over a white tunic. her dark eyes dart fearfully around in her pale face. she is half carried, half dragged to the edge of a steaming crack in the ground where she is manacled to a wooden post. by lantern light, horsrik reads from a parchment scroll.}
<C>__{horsrik}
<D>__{now be it known throughout the kingdom, that this maiden, having lawfully been chosen by a deed of fortune and destiny, shall hereby give up her life for the greater good of urland.}
<A>__{there is a low rumble; the earth shakes. horsrik glances nervously around. he carries on by rote.}
<C>__{horsrik}
<D>__{by this act shall be satisfied the powers that dwell underground and the spirits that attend thereto. in gratitude for this sacrifice his majesty has declared the family what's the name? }
<A>__{he prods the girl, but she is too terrified to speak. beneath them, the earth seems to groan. smoke issues from the mouth of the pit. one of the nervous witnesses leans forward.}
<C>__{retainer}
<D>__{plowman! the family plowman!}
<C>__{horsrik}
<P>__{(rushing it)}
<D>__{ the family plowman to be free of obligations, taxations, levys and imposts for a period not to exceed five years...}
<A>__{the horse suddenly rears, and blindfold notwithstanding, gallops off, dragging the tumbril over the rocks. the men behind horsrik break ranks and scatter.}
<C>__{horsrik}
<D>__{ ordained and signed this day, etc., casiodorus, in his glory the reigning king of this our realm... his seal, his mark, duly read by chancellor horsrik in his holy name.}
<A>__{now horsrik joins the flight, chasing his men back over the murky horizon.}
<B>__{the girl}
<A>__{she strains against her manacles, cocking her head to listen as the rumblings below subside. presently the steam and smoke blow away and she can see the horse pawing and stamping a hundred yards distant, the wheel of the cart jammed between rocks. summoning up a wild will to live, she squeezes her hands against the cold iron rings. no use. she spits on her wrists and twists desperately. blood starts. one hand slips free. she looks at the horse. the animal tosses off its blindfold and looks back at her. now she strains again and pulls her other hand free. she wipes the blood on her frock and sprints toward the horse. but she doesn't get there. the earth abruptly shifts from under her feet, tumbling her among cracked and steaming rocks. when she raises her head a huge shadow has fallen over the horse. there is a piteous whinny, then a roar. the girl's face is suddenly lit by flames. she scrambles to her feet and rushes back the other way.}
<B>__{the chase}
<A>__{the girl hasn't taken a dozen steps when something huge hurtles forward and blocks her way. something scaly and glittering. she whirls and stumbles off in a new direction. this time she's cut off by a monstrous claw tipped with rapier like talons. she screams and crawls away. another claw prevents her escape.}
<B>__{the creature}
<A>__{membranous wings fold down against the night sky. up comes the silhouette of a reptilian head swaying on a serpentine neck. there's an angry hiss. a sheet of flame envelops everything.}
