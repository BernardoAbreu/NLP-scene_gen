<A>__{xander steels himself, takes a few deep breaths. then he sprints to the edge and jumps off the cliff... and that's it. he's gone. one mile, straight down. suddenly we're falling with him. we hear the rush of air as he free falls a dozen feet from the craggy rock face. the force of the wind ripples his cheeks. he streamlines himself into a track position and jets away from the cliff like superman. before he gets too low, he rips the buckle. immediately his jumpsuit tears off his body in multiple layers, unfurling into a full sized parasail. xander looks up at his parasail, relieved, and glides towards the ship.}
