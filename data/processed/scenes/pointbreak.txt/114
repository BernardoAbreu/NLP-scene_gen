<A>__{on a long lens, very stacked up, we see johnny standing at the grody pick up window. he keeps looking at the bank, visible b.g. the pick up window opens and food appears, sliding out. utah turns, pulling out his wallet.}
<C>__{voice from inside}
<D>__{two meatball, one tuna on wheat, two lemonades. total's seven eighty four.}
<A>__{as johnny is counting out the bills, a burgundy thunderbird pulls up in front of the bank. the doors fly open. the ex presidents jump out. they sprint for the entrance. all this out of focus, b.g. johnny misses it as he picks up the food order. the presidents disappear inside. johnny looks toward the bank again. there is no movement. reverse, as utah walks back toward his car. pappas is still under the paper. he slides it down when he smells food.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{here, yours is the one that looks like a road kill. enjoy.}
<A>__{utah throws a big stack of napkins through the window into pappas' lap. still standing next to the car.}

<P>__{(without looking)}
<D>__{damn, i could eat the ass out of an elephant. i shoulda had you get me three a these. what t bird?}
<A>__{pappas is about to take a huge bite when a meatball falls out of the end of the sandwich. it lands on the seat next to him. he looks at it. picks it up. pops it into his mouth and freezes, mouth open. eyes focused on... the ex presidents, in living color, flashing through the doors of the bank 80 feet away. johnny is so astounded he doesn't do anything for about two seconds. pappas coughs out his meatball, eyes bugging.}

<C>__{utah}
<D>__{fbi!! freeze!! right now!}
<A>__{nixon spins, raising his shotgun. but reagan knocks the muzzle down with his hand. shoves him into the car. then reagan jumps behind the wheel. the back wheels light up, smoking, as the t bird launches. utah fires. blam! blam! blam! he puts two into the trunk and blows the back window into junk jewelry. the t bird peels out into traffic, clipping a subaru which locks them up and spins.}
