<L>__{exterior park on a bluff day}
<A>__{the bluff overlooks the ocean. it's a beautiful spot. just the right setting for an outdoor wedding. some folding chairs have been set up and a canvas canopy. gathered for the rehearsal are gary, ryko, chulo, o'neill who is with bobbie, debbie's mother and mr. thomerson, phoebe, ilene, tina, stan, a gray haired priest. father falwell and, of course, rick and debbie. everyone is admiring this picturesque setting. everyone but mr. thomerson. he's very underjoyed at the sight of rick and his friends. mr. and mrs. thomerson are standing with father falwell. they are watching rick holding debbie.}
<C>__{mr. thomerson}
<D>__{the thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.}
<C>__{mrs. thomerson}
<D>__{you can tell a man by his friends.}
<C>__{father falwell}
<D>__{they're not such a bad bunch.}
<C>__{mr. thomerson}
<D>__{no?}
<P>__{(he points off)}
<D>__{that's his best man peeing on a tree.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{in the b.g. we see o'neill's back to us. he is definitely relieving himself on a weeping willow. the wind begins to pick up.}
<C>__{father falwell}
<D>__{if everyone would take their positions...}
<A>__{everyone takes their places for the wedding procession. the wind now takes this time to blow with much greater force. as father falwell opens his bible, the wind rips the pages out of the holy book. they blow to the four corners of the earth.}
<C>__{father falwell}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{oh, dear. well, let's begin. and...}
<A>__{he hums the wedding march. chulo hums along. his humming is a driving jimi hendrix like guitar lick that all but drowns out father's humming.}
<B>__{father falwell}
<A>__{he's orchestrating the proceedings.}
<C>__{father falwell}
<D>__{flower girls... now rick...}
<P>__{(he gestures for him to start down the aisle)}
<D>__{good... debbie and mr. thomerson.}
<A>__{as he gestures for them to make their walk to him, a gust of wind lifts up father's cassock, exposing his bare ass. he quickly grabs his cassock and covers himself.}
<B>__{rick}
<A>__{he begins to walk toward the priest. suddenly, out of nowhere, cole appears at his side.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{cole. don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i want debbie.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{cole...}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you dump her and i will give you cash.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{what's debbie's blue book value right now?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{five thousand dollars.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{they are now standing near father falwell. debbie is approaching them with mr. thomerson. mr. t. shoots cole a signal to up the ante.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{seventy five hundred.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{not interested.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{okay, ten thousand plus a g.e. toaster oven, a litton microwave, a cuisinart...}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i'm marrying debbie.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{michelin tires... brand new. a set of sears best metric tools...}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(to o'neill)}
<D>__{what is this person's story here?}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{the way i see it, the big lug is in love and he's got a lot of major appliances lying around.}
<A>__{debbie and mr. t. have joined rick.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{cole, what are you doing here?}
<C>__{mr. thomerson}
<D>__{he's just trying to save you from making a mistake.}
<P>__{(to rick)}
<D>__{a big mistake.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{thanks, dad.}
<P>__{(to cole)}
<D>__{cole, go away.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{he's gonna hurt you, debbie. he'll never be true to you the way i would.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{thank you. we'll all keep that in mind. 'bye now.}
<A>__{cole turns red with anger.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{rick, me and you aren't through yet.}
<A>__{he runs off.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(a la talk show host)}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, cole whittier. let's hear it for him a funny, funny guy. we love ya, babe.}
<A>__{the wind suddenly picks up. a storm is coming in off the sea. father falwell's cassock blows up again. it starts to rain and hail. everyone runs for cover but rick and o'neill.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(to o'neill)}
<D>__{you think the gods are telling me something?}
