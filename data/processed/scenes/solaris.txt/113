<A>__{quick glimpses of rheya. in several of them she is in repose, thinking, as if to illustrate snow's pointerior}

<A>__{back to kelvin, thinking.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{they come when you sleep.}
<C>__{snow}
<D>__{that's right. and we all have to sleep, eventually.}

<L>__{interior kelvin's room}
<A>__{kelvin on the bed with rheya. their eyes are closed. we think they are asleep until:}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{you don't want me.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{rheya.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{that's what you were saying. i heard what you were saying.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{for a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me. that's all i know right now.}
<A>__{she realizes she doesn't want to argue. not right now, anyway.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{i have these strange thoughts, i don't know where they come from.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i can't explain it.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{neither can i. not any of it. there's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. it's a clean break in the fabric of the universe; a gap. there is nothing to do but experience it, moment to moment, and not let it destroy us.}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{but that's what happened before.}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{not this time.}
<A>__{he kisses her. she wants to believe him, so she says nothing. then:}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{do you want to stay here?}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{if you're here.}
<A>__{they kiss again...}
