<D>__{it's not a charade, all this?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{a charade? how could it be a charade?}
<A>__{she doesn't know, but she does know him. and all these signs of apparent success just don't fit his profile. schindler lets her in on a discovery.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{there's no way i could have known this before, but there was always something missing. in every business i tried, i see now it wasn't me that was failing, it was this thing, this missing thing. even if i'd known what it was, there's nothing i could have done about it, because you can't create this sort of thing. and it makes all the difference in the world between success and failure.}
<A>__{he waits for her to guess what the thing is. his looks says, it's so simple, how can you not know?}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{luck.}
