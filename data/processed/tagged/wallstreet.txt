<L>__{exterior wall street early morning}
<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{. the street. the most famous third of a mile in the world. towering landmark structures nearly blot out the dreary grey flannel sky. the morning rush hour crowds swarm through the dark, narrow streets like mice in a maze, all in pursuit of one thing: money... credits run.}
<L>__{interior subway platform early morning}
<A>__{we hear the roar of the trains pulling out of the station. blurred faces, bodies, suits, hats, attache cases float into view pressed like sardines against the sides of a door which now open, releasing an outward velocity of anger and greed, one of them bud fox.}
<L>__{exterior subway exit morning}
<A>__{the bubbling mass charges up the stairs. steam rises from a grating, shapes merging into the crowd. past the homeless vets, the insane bag lady with 12 cats and 20 shopping bags huddled in the corner of trinity church... bud the fox straggling behind, in a crumpled raincoat, tie askew, young, very young, his bleary face buried in a wall street journal, folded, 'subway style', as he crosses the street against the light.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{why fox? why didn't you buy... schmuck?}
<A>__{a car honks, swerving past.}
<L>__{interior office building day}
<A>__{cavernous modern lobby. bodies cramming into elevators. bud, stuffing the newspaper into his coat, jams in.}
<L>__{interior elevator morning}
<A>__{blank faces stare ahead, each lost in private thoughts, bud again mouthing the thought, "stupid schmuck", his eyes catching a blond executive who quickly flicks her eyes away. paranoia in the elevator. we quickly cut into private lives.}
<C>__{worried man }
<D>__{... he'll sue me, could be for 5 6 million, and he'll get a million, the house, they'll impound my paychecks...damn, damn, why did i sign that contract?}
<C>__{black bike messenger }
<D>__{... gotta get lola in the sack man, take her to the garden for the terrells, jimmy give me the tickets for 12 bucks, i pull the midnight shift, i could do 60 bucks... wow, check those legs out...}
<A>__{his eyes on the same blonde exec who looks away, self conscious about her legs. the elevator stops at a floor, discards only one person. the doors close a little too slowly.}
<C>__{blonde executive }
<D>__{... jerk...}
<P>__{(shifts her thoughts)}
<D>__{call hanratty. the decimal points on the code are uncalibrated. hoskins. the signatures on the bank draft. boyle, that bitch...insurance...tax form. shit, talk to kahn.}
<P>__{(recalling)}
<D>__{that's hanratty, hoskins, bank, boyle and kahn... h2b2k shoot, insurance and theatre tix...h2b2k,i,t and the cleaners! repeat...}
<A>__{catching the eyes of bud fox once again wandering to her. camera moving to bud who looks away.}
<C>__{bud }
<D>__{...sorry, what a fox... funny, the most beautiful girls in the world are always on the street or in elevators, never get to talk to them, shy ... my looks, never had confidence in them ... overcompensating work syndrome... prove your worth with money... 'cept i'm not making any money...}
<P>__{(pause, the elevator at another floor, slow)}
<D>__{... wonder what all these people are thinking about.}
<A>__{camera moving slowly again over the eyes. the silence of individual tension reigns over all.}
<C>__{angry man }
<D>__{...screw him! i will destroy that sonufabitch... he thinks he can break a contract with me he's got something to learn.}
<C>__{secretary }
<D>__{...9:15!... he'll kill me this time, he will really kill me... oh come on elevator!... why do you stop on every floor...}
<A>__{as the elevator stops again to disgorge two people.}
<C>__{bike messenger }
<P>__{(pissed now at the elevator)}
<D>__{... come on man, time is money man... one floor here i could do eleven blocks...}
<C>__{blonde executive }
<D>__{h2b2k,i,t,cl,p,o,t2...}
<P>__{(pause, she looks like she forgot something)}
<C>__{worried man }
<D>__{...goddamn elevators!...people, too many goddamn people in this world!}
<A>__{the elevator finally comes to a slow stop... they wait, plead, beg, screech with the eyes. the door at last opens. none of them acknowledging each other, they all stampede out the door with an audible gasp of release, a collective sign akin to making it to a urinal after a punishing wait... the elevator tension is over, but the killer grind continues.}
<L>__{interior jackson, steinem investment house day}
<A>__{credits continue to run. bud moves past the functional reception area, past carolyn, a cheerful young black girl.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{how you doing buddy?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{great carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...}
<A>__{he slips off his overcoat, flicks some lint off his paul stuart $500 suit, and enters the main trading room. brokers mill by their desks, gulping coffee, scanning the papers, the quotrons. the digital clock by the big board counter clicks to 9:26 am four minutes until the market opens. you can smell the hunger. bud takes a deep breath, tosses the newspaper away and struts into the office fuck it it's a new day. moving past dan steeples, a flush faced old timer, a blue and white yale tie, with a carnation in his lapel.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{morning, dan. what's looking good today?}
<C>__{steeples}
<D>__{if i know i wouldn't be in this business. get out while you're young, kid. i came here one day, i sat down, and look at me now.}
<A>__{past charlie cushing, on the phone, a handsome chunk of man with rugged good looks and ivy league mannerisms.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{...hey chuckie, how's the woman slayer?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{...if i had your looks, better.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(used to it)}
<D>__{...takes years of genetics, pal, and a yale education... and the right tailor.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{...not that you learned anything, chunk.}
<A>__{bud reaches his trading desk, whips open his briefcase and pulls out a computer print out of last night's homework.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, marv.}
<C>__{marv }
<D>__{yeah, where's your machine gun.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{joke about it. i was up all night charting these stocks. you want to see this or what?}
<A>__{his associate, marvin, a manicky wise guy, swivels over his chair from a nearby desk. he gives the charts a quick read.}
<C>__{marv}
<P>__{(scowling)}
<D>__{looks bearish to me, buddy. you got it all upside down.}
<P>__{(confidential)}
<D>__{okay, i'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause i feel sorry for you. take the knicks against the bullets, and my pick of the day duke to beat the spread against wake forest.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{thanks, marv, with that i might be able to qualify for welfare.}
<A>__{lou mannheim, strolls in, a dignified looking older broker in his late 60's, wearing an old brown brim hat with button down white shirt, narrow tie, very much a picture from another era... a kind humor in his eyes... but obviously ailing in the legs and breath department.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(friendly)}
<D>__{you got a look in your eye, mr. mannheim... you got something for the small fry...}
<C>__{mannheim}
<D>__{jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. the biggest mistake we ever made was letting nixon get off the gold standard. putney drug you boys might want to have a look at it.}
<C>__{marv}
<D>__{take 5 years for that company to turn around.}
<C>__{mannheim}
<D>__{...but they got a good new drug. stick to the fundamentals, that's how ibm and hilton were built...good things sometimes take time.}
<A>__{the stentorian voice of office manager hieronymus lynch booms over the intercom. we see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit office; tall, balding with a perpetual worried look on his face.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{attention. please. office production is down ten percent this week. i recommend that you all go through your clients' investments for any portfolio adjustments. and don't forget double commissions today on our 'a' or better bond funds.}
<P>__{(looking in bud and marv's direction)}
<D>__{especially you rookies. also, remember, the sales contest ends tomorrow.}
<A>__{bud and marvin roll their eyes. the digital clock flashes}
<L>__{9:30. the credits close.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{and they're off and running!}
<A>__{the room rises to a subtle but new energy level with the clatter of the ticker, speakers, teletype machines, newsprinters' dow jones and reuters, phones ringing off the hook. brokers are shouting orders, running for tickets, dodging each other; it's a controlled riot.}
<C>__{brokers}
<D>__{here's a hot lead... have i got one for you.... sell ... dump it all!! ... 500 at an eighth, an eighth!... july fifties. april thirties...how bout those decembers? you see where they're going? ... morgan is selling a billion one at the close. yeah. that's right, they're selling all over the place... we're still long on the treasuries $110 million. what about the japs? ...where am i?}
<P>__{(confused at all the phone lights)}
<D>__{we gotta lot of lights here! let's pick 'em up.}

<D>__{jack, take 50 gulf, with a 3 8 top, forget the hundred. what about delroy? i can go long at 23, let's go long...conwest air let me check it...}
<A>__{he looks up at the ticker... stock quotes whizzing by.}
<C>__{bud }
<D>__{up an eighth. how many you want? it's on the floor.}
<A>__{he writes the order up. a shot of charlie cushing yawning as he half listens to his customer, resting the phone on his kneecaps.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the clock... it's 2.30 p.m. we hear the relentless clatter of the board ticker, and the drone of disembodied voices, blarihg market information out of squawk boxes. bud's desk is now cluttered with order tickets, literature, crumpled notes, beverage cups and a half eaten sandwich. he's on the phone and from the look on his face, the caller on the other end is breaking his balls. marvin paces past, making a dramatic phone pitch.}
<C>__{marv}
<D>__{dr. beltzer has to have his information this minute! it concerns his future!}
<A>__{bud waves marvin away, answers his caller, trying to keep cool, worried how as he sees lynch, the office manager, coming over.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{hey howard, i thought you were a gentleman. sure it's gone down a little bit, but you got the tip from your printer, i didn't... yeah you did. that's what you said.}
<P>__{(heated)}
<D>__{i didn't tell you to buy it, why would i tell you to sell it?}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{no, i can't give it back! give it back to who? you own it!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no, he's out right now.}
<A>__{as he looks up and winks at lynch, standing over him.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(cupping the receiver)}
<D>__{... that's what you told us to say.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{give me that phone.}

<D>__{yes, sir, this is the manager. what seems to be the problem?}
<C>__{marv}
<P>__{(into his phone)}
<D>__{what?... well, how was i to know you were in surgery? what am i marvin the mind reader here?}
<A>__{bud whispers, tensely. lynch listens.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{he's lying.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{okay, sir. i will discuss this with the broker and i will get back to you. you're welcome.}
<A>__{lynce hangs up and glares at bud.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{if i'm closing out this account. if he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{mr. lynch, i swear to you, he's lying!}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i don't think you're being fair, sir. you assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{somebody has to pay for that error. and it's not me.}
<A>__{lynch walks off. bud does some quick calculations in his head.}

<P>__{(reappearing)}
<D>__{buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(devastated)}
<D>__{howard the jerk reneged on me. i've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! i'm tapped out man, american express got a hit man looking for me.}
<C>__{marv}
<D>__{hey, things could be worse. it could've been my money. let me help you out, rookie.}
<A>__{he takes out his wallet and loans bud a hundred bucks.}
<C>__{bud}

<P>__{(fervently)}
<D>__{you know what my dream is? one day to be on the other end of that phone...}

<D>__{just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. you forgetting something?}
<A>__{marvin points up at the clock. bud looks up... it's 2:40. bud quickly composes himself. he picks up the phone, dialing purposefully.}
<C>__{marv }
<D>__{buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. i heard this story about gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the challenger blew up selling nasa stocks short.}

<L>__{interior gekko office day}
<A>__{natalie, a classy attractive englishwoman is on the phone with bud, somewhat amused by his manner. she is the personal secretary to multimillionaire, wall street trader and raider, gordon gekko. his windows look out on a panoramic view of the city and east river.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{mr. fox, i've told you before, i'm sure you're a good broker, but our traders talk to the brokers, mr. gekko only deals with investment bankers. yes, i shall give him your message ...}
<A>__{as they're speaking, another secretary leads two well heeled japanese businessmen past her desk. as she opens the door to the inner office and ushers them inside, we catch a glimpse of a figure, pacing back and forth, talking animatedly on the phone by the huge corner window. he is gordon gekko. we hear a deafening roar as we:}

<P>__{(increased laughter, he's getting them)}
<D>__{the new law of evolution in corporate america seems to be 'survival of the unfittest'. well in my book, you either do it right or you get eliminated. teldar paper is doomed to fail. its diversification into casualty insurance has not worked. its crown jewels are its trees, the rest is dross. through wars, depressions, inflations and deterioration of paper money, trees have always kept their value, but teldar is chopping them all down. forests are perishable, forest rights are as important as human rights to this planet, and all the illusory maginot lines, scorched earth tactics, proxy fights, poison pills, etc. that mr. cromwell is going to come up with to prevent people like me from buying teldar paper are doomed to fail because the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, as you very well know, is the only way to stay strong is to create value, that's why you buy stock, to have it go up. if there's any other reason, i've never hear it.}
<P>__{(laughter)}
<D>__{that's all i'm saying...it's you people who own this company, not them, they work for you and they've done a lousy job of it. get rid of them fast, before you all get sick and die. i may be an opportunist, but if these clowns did a better job, i'd be out of work. in the last seven deals i've been in, there were 2.3 million stockholders that actually made a pretax profit of $12 billion. when i bought the ixtlan corporation it was in the exact same position teldar is today i turned three of its companies private and i sold four others and each of these companies, liberated from the suffering conglomerate has prospered. i am not a destroyer of companies, i am a liberator of them. the point is, ladies and gentlemen, greed is good. greed works, greed is right. greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. greed in all its forms, greed for life, money, love, knowledge, has marked the upward surge of mankind and greed, mark my words will save not only teldar paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the usa...thank you.}
