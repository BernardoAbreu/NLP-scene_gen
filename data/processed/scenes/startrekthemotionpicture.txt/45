<L>__{interior recreation deck (m)}
<A>__{we see that all this was being viewed by the crew members (aliens included) assembled on the rec deck. the recreation deck is one of the largest areas on the ship, several deck levels high, a part of one wall consisting of picture windows, through which can be seen sections of the drydock structure outside. on another wall is a large viewer, on which was just shown the klingon transmission. leading off and away from this deck area are what are obviously other specific recreation areas gymnasiums, food centers, game rooms, lounges, etc. another angle of the red deck higher level as the crew members chat in low, grim tones kirk (now with captain's stripes) appears. as he comes into view, the two hundred or so crew below go silent. kirk grimly indicates the now blank viewer:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{that's all we know about it; except that it's now 2.2 days from earth. enterprise is the only federation starship that stands in its way.}
<A>__{another angle crew reactions as the camera finds various faces: human, alien; most young, all intelligent, forthright anxious. kirk has paused a moment, now continues.}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{we assume there is a vessel of some type at the heart of the cloud. our orders are to intercept, investigate; and take whatever action is necessary... and possible.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...we can only hope that the life form aboard that vessel reasons as we do.}
<B>__{angle on uhura}
<A>__{standing near an intercom, which just then has emitted a bosun's whistle intercom signal.}
<C>__{bridge voice}
<P>__{(from intercom)}
<D>__{bridge to captain. priority signal from epsilon nine }
<A>__{kirk leans over to the intercom, speaks into it:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{put it on the viewer here...!}
<A>__{on the rec deck viewer (o) as all eyes turn to the viewer which fades into a view of commander branch, in the epsilon 9 monitor room. branch is tense, reflecting extreme urgency. near branch, working intently at the console are the female lieutenant and a technician.}
<C>__{branch}
<P>__{(from the viewer;}
<D>__{checking console}
<P>__{readings)}
<D>__{enterprise... the cloud is definitely a powerfield of some kind... measures... my god! over 82 a.u.'s in diameter... must be something incredible inside there generating it.}
<P>__{(looks up from console)}
<D>__{we're transmitting linguacode friendship messages on all frequencies. no response.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{i have a null reading at the center of the 'cloud,' sir.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{definitely something inside.. there but all scans are being reflected back.}
<P>__{(studies readings)}
<D>__{receiving an odd pattern now..}
<P>__{(toward branch)}
<D>__{they seem to be reacting to our scans, sir.}
<C>__{branch}
<P>__{(inspecting another console)}
<D>__{some kind of energy surge...}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{enterprise... they could be mistaking our scans as a hostile act...}
<P>__{(reacts at readings)}
<D>__{deflectors, emergency full!}
<A>__{branch hits an alarm button; we hear alarm klaxon sounding. the viewer image distorts, clears again while branch facing his viewer, continues urgently:}
<C>__{branch}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{we are under attack...!}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(to uhura)}
<D>__{external view...!}
<A>__{on the viewer exterior the destruction of epsilon 9 (o) as the image of branch is immediately replaced by an external view of the plantoid, and the luminescent cloud (at about the same distance from which the klingon cruisers were attacked). then it strikes the plantoid with full, cataclysmic force. the viewer image breaks up and immediately the entire starfleet base becomes a maelstrom of flar ing energy, shattered structure, flying debris. and then, all at once, there is nothing empty space, epsilon 9 is gone. we see only the stars; and the mysterious luminescent cloud moving across the distant sky. (note: the above is entirely silent, and when it is finished, not a word is spoken.)}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{viewer off.}
<A>__{another angle kirk as the viewer goes blank, all still facing the screen. then kirk turns to the room as if to comment. then he stops nothing he can say will add at all to what they've just seen. instead:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{pre launch countdown will commence in forty minutes.}
<A>__{another angle crew the scene they have just witnessed still vivid in their minds as they gaze somberly up toward kirk who is exit ing. the bridge crew follows him out. not a word is said as the remainder of the crew waits another moment, then begins to disperse toward their duty stations too.}
