<A>__{sun, passing into mystery. wheatfield, rippling. caitlin is in the yard, chasing a big floppy eared labrador. on the porch, a cricket chirps. hal comes out, sits beside his wife charly as she finishes eating. says softly:}

<D>__{just talked to dr. sullivan, she's gonna need the full braces. even with your teaching, insurance won't cover it... i don't know what to do.}
<A>__{pause. charly says nothing. the dog parades up to caitlin with a stick in its jaws. a farm truck goes by, a faraway speck. charly absent mindedly rolls a steak knife in her fingers. eyes far away. it never occurs to her what she's done until the chirping stops. ten feet away, the knife quivers.}
