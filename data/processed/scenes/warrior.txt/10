<A>__{a big, old school warehouse, where a handful of guys whale away at mma punching dummies and roll around on sweat saturated mats. sun slants through a dirty, industrial skylight. a no frills kind of gym. behind the front counter, fenroy (20s) rolls hand wraps and watches espn's "mma live" on a laptop. on computer screen: espn anchor jon anik interviews promoter j.j. riley, and punkass and skyskrape from tapout.}
<C>__{jon anik }
<D>__{and we return here on mma live, jon anik alongside billionaire fight promoter j.j. riley. the tapout crew is also here. punk and skrape are in the building. now j.j., what led to this project that is redefining mixed martial arts here in the states?}
<C>__{j.j. riley }
<D>__{well, mixed martial arts is a sport that i've always been incredibly passionate about. as for where the idea for sparta came from, i've always kind of dug the grand prix format, so i tracked these guys down to help me out.}
<C>__{punkass }
<D>__{when j.j. came to us he said he wanted to create the super bowl of mixed martial arts.}
<C>__{skrape }
<D>__{and he decided to put up the five million dollar purse, too.}
<C>__{jon anik }
<D>__{well, there you have it. it shall be done. hedge fund king j.j. riley, going from the lion's den of wall street to the cage, promoting the biggest winner take all tournament in mma history. sparta.}

<C>__{fenroy}
<D>__{don't know no fitzy. colt boyd owns this gym.}
<A>__{fenroy goes back to his computer. tommy stands there. notices a sparta poster on the wall reading: "the war on the shore. atlantic city, july 2 3. biggest winner take all in mma history!"}
