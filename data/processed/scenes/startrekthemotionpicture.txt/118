<L>__{interior mccoy's office}
<A>__{as kirk, spock and decker enter, the door snapping shut and spock touching the electronic lock to secure them. he faces the others:}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{captain... this probe may be a key a key to the aliens.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{it's a programmed mechanism , mr. spock...}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{we have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in precise detail. suppose that beneath its programming, the real ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{they had a pattern to follow...}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{... they may have followed it too precisely.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(comprehending)}
<D>__{ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.}
<B>__{angle on decker}
<A>__{also comprehending, and not liking it one bit as spock and kirk are both turning their attention to him.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{exactly.}
<P>__{(to decker)}
<D>__{and you did have a 'relationship' with lieutenant ilia, commander.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{that probe in there in a different form now is the same thing that killed ilia!}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{commander, we're locked in an alien vessel, six hours from earth orbit, our only contact with our captors is the probe. if we can control it, persuade it, use it in some way...}
<A>__{interrupted by the sound of someone trying to open the locked door behind them. then a metal ripping sound as they whirl to see:}
<B>__{medical office door}
<A>__{with the metal buckling, tearing and a single hand slicing the steel door like paper . it is the "ilia" probe, her face absolutely impassive, her whole manner incongruously benign. (behind her, a startled mccoy, chapel and chekov.) "ilia" speaks flatly, blandly.}
<D>__{"ilia" i have recorded enough here.}
<P>__{(motions to kirk)}
<D>__{you will now assist me further.}
<A>__{kirk exchanges a quick glance with spock. then:}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(indicating decker)}
<D>__{the decker unit can assist you with much greater efficiency...}
<A>__{"ilia" has seemed about to object but now her eyes hold on decker. then she nods.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{carry on with your assignment, mr. decker.}
<A>__{another angle across decker to the smashed door (and "ilia") as decker looks at "ilia" who stands at the torn door. you can read decker's mind: i'm supposed to persuade that?! he turns back, finds kirk's eyes on him. decker nods.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{aye, sir.}
<A>__{"ilia" and a reluctant decker exit.}
<B>__{emphasizing spock}
<A>__{looking very troubled as they watch decker and "ilia" leave. kirk notices.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{spock? concerned about his chances?}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{i am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.}
<A>__{spock exits.}
