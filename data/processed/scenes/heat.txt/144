<L>__{exterior sunset. boulevard motel and alley night}
<A>__{neon under the vapor lamps. o.s. the cacophony of horns and sirens. pimps and hookers crowd the background. a crime scene area near the garbage cans is roped off. an ambulance, black and whites, a medical examiner's van clog the alley. crane down as hanna's car pulls in and he approaches the medical examiner, richie, 25 35, black, diamond earring, gray lab coat.}
<C>__{richie}
<P>__{(to hanna)}
<D>__{here's how we found her.}
<A>__{polaroid black prostitute in a nightgown, folded over the lip of a garbage can at the waist. she's a pitiful rag doll. someone killed her and then threw her away.}

<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{how'd she die, richie?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{blunt instrument. cerebral hematoma.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{who are they?}
<A>__{their pov: heavyset black woman and two stunned young boys. she's crying and arguing with two uniformed lapd trying to hold her back. one lapd is a black woman. the heavyset woman doesn't really know what happened yet except it's bad.}

<A>__{richie + hanna}
<C>__{richie}
<P>__{(low; shrugs)}
<D>__{it's fucked up. somebody inside knew the girl and called the family.}
<A>__{now richie bends over the body bag on the ground and unzips it. we don't see the dead girl. we only see hanna. a third uniformed officer in the background spins away.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{oh, this is nice.}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{i wanted you to see this 'cause i got a feeling it's serial and gonna end up in your court.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{homicide getting anywhere?}
<C>__{richie}
<D>__{nowhere.}
<A>__{hanna rises. the mother's arguing with the man cop because she wants to see. horror and hysteria blossoming through shock. she pushes the uniformed cop of the way. hanna goes to try to help. they grapple.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(reaches out)}
<D>__{baby! where's my baby.!}
<A>__{anguish. it's a mess. the woman collapsing into hanna's arms. for one moment hanna's eyes lock onto hers. he freezes. one doesn't forget the look he sees in her eyes.}
