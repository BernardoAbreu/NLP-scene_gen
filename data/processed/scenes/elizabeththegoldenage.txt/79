<L>__{interior study, walsingham's house night}
<A>__{walsingham is at work at his desk. a knock on the door. walsingham does not look up from his papers. william enters, wrapped in a cloak, one hand concealed.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{it's me. william.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<P>__{(still not looking up)}
<D>__{where have you been? we haven't seen you for days.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i met up with some old friends.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{from paris, no doubt.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{and now you've come back.}
<A>__{he looks up at last.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{do you know, i can still remember the day you were born?}
<A>__{he smiles, but there's sadness in his eyes.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{i was eleven years old. and you, this helpless bundle. i looked at you in your crib, with your little wrinkled face, and i loved you from the first. i vowed then to look after you. i watched you grow up with your head in the clouds, always a dreamer. i couldn't follow you there. and now i've failed you, haven't i? forgive me if i haven't loved you enough.}
<A>__{clink. something falls from william's hand to the floor. his face has gone grey.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{did you really think i didn't know?}
<A>__{on the floor a dagger. william opens his mouth to answer, but no sound comes out. walsingham raps twice on his desk. the door opens, and agents 4 and 5 enter.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{was it for money? at least tell me you got a good price.}
<B>__{w}
<A>__{illiam shakes his head.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{what then? what would you murder your own brother for?}

<A>__{walsingham stares at him. a great sadness building.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{eternal life. the bribe no man can refuse.}
