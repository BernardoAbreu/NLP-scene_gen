<D>__{yeah.}
<L>__{exterior highway day}
<A>__{the bus tires sing as it speeds south.}
<L>__{interior greyhound bus day}
<A>__{joe and ratso have reversed places, putting ratso by the window. joe watches a middle aged couple try on their new straw hats, unaware that joe is watching them.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{you get your first palm tree in south carolina.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{how'n hell a dumb bronx kid like you know that?}

<A>__{the metal grating rings as the bus soars onto it.}
<L>__{interior greyhound bus night}
<A>__{two aging young ladies in brand new resort wear are casually examining joe, along with the other men on the bus, but joe is frowning at ratso, who shivers despite the bright sun.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{if you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{i been thinking. i hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{keep the goddam blanket on.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{i mean new york's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'hey, ratso' how does that sound to you?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{sounds like they knew you.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{sounds like crap, admit it. and i'm not gonna have it. i'm rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? that's agreed, okay? we're gonna tell all these new people my name's rico?}
<A>__{joe nods. ratso closes his eyes, momentarily at peace.}
<L>__{exterior highway dawn}
<A>__{the bus passes a florida hotel sign too swiftly to read it.}
<L>__{interior greyhound bus dawn}
<A>__{joe frowns in his sleep, awakens, lifts his stetson to see ratso wide awake, in misery, wiping tears from his eyes.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{hey whatsa matter?}
<C>__{ratso}
<P>__{(barely audible)}
<D>__{i'm wet.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you're what?}

<D>__{hell, don't cry about it!}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{here i am going to florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, i gotta pee all over myself.}
<A>__{joe laughs suddenly, uncontrollably.}
<C>__{ratso }
<D>__{i'm falling apart, that's funny?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(nods, laughing)}
<D>__{you just just what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.}
<A>__{ratso begins to laugh with joe as if it were the funniest thing they'd ever heard. then ratso's face pales as he starts to choke and cough. joe pats him on the back.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{hey, what size pants you wear?}
<L>__{exterior small town street day}
<A>__{the bus is parked in the distance. joe comes from a clothing store, bare headed, wearing plain slacks and sport shirt. he carries the boots, stetson and cowboy suit in one hand, a bundle under his arm. he dumps his cowboy regalia in the trash bin of a sandwich stand and calls to the waitress.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{couple crullers'n coffee to go.}
<A>__{the waitress draws coffee, wraps crullers.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{where you from?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{new york.}
<A>__{joe pays. she smiles, gives him change. joe smiles, starts on toward the bus, hardly aware that he has accomplished something rare and remarkable for joe a simple human contact without fear or threat, a pleasant everyday happening.}
<L>__{interior greyhound bus day}
<A>__{joe and ratso have moved to the seat farthest back, wider than the others. joe blocks the view of the other passengers as he helps ratso into a new pair of corduroy pants and a florida shirt. in the middle of the operation, ratso dozes off. joe shakes his head, scowling, annoyed, but continues, lifting ratso enough to slide the pants around his waist. ratso awakens as joe zips the fly.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{hey, what the hell you doing?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think i'm doing?}
<A>__{they both smile. it isn't funny enough to laugh at. joe arranges the blanket, takes out a package of cigarettes, glances at ratso and puts it away.}
<L>__{exterior traveling shot with bus day}
<A>__{palm trees are streaking past the window. the sun is glaring hot. a group of kids in bare feet and straw hats wave to the bus as it passes.}
<L>__{interior greyhound bus day}
<A>__{ratso's eyes squint in a dazed half sleep. joe leans across to pull down the shade. he hesitates a moment, watching... ... past his reflection, a group of young men on their way to work, carrying lunch pails, dressed exactly as joe is now dressed... ... then joe lowers the blind and seats himself. ratso nods slightly, his voice practically inaudible.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{thanks, joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{shee it, you know, i got this thing all figured out, ratso. i mean rico. when we get to miami, what i will do, i will go to work. i gotta do that, 'cause see, i ain't no kind of a hustler. i ain't even any goddam good as a bum. i'm a nothing, that's what i am. so reckon i'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. okay?}
<A>__{joe glances at ratso, but there is no response. surreptitiously, joe takes out a cigarette, turns his face away from ratso and lights it, hiding it cupped in his hand as he smokes.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{yeah, guess that's what i'm gonna do.}
<A>__{they ride for a moment in semi darkness, joe smoking, looking at the other people on the bus, brighter without the shades down. joe turns, checking the blanket around ratso, noticing that ratso is sitting in a peculiarly stiff, awkward position. joe leans over to straighten ratso's head, blocking our view for a moment. then joe leans back, frowning, thoughtful. we still do not see ratso's face. joe rises slowly, starting forward in the bus... ... passing an older couple, a schoolgirl, two ladies with straw hats, a young man trying to read, pausing when he reaches... ... the driver, staring out at the sunshine parkway with the driver, leaning over so he won't have to speak too loudly.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{yes, sir? joe, my friend's dead in the back seat.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{your friend's what in the back seat?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{dead. dead as a doornail.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{is this some kind of...}
<A>__{he glances at joe, then pulls off the road and stands up.}
<C>__{driver }
<D>__{okay, folks, everything's fine. nothing to worry about.}
<A>__{the passengers crane their necks as joe follows the driver to the rear of the bus. the passengers at the rear are staring ahead, trying not to see what is going on. the driver touches ratso, straightens, touches his hat, but doesn't remove it.}
<C>__{driver }
<D>__{is he kin to you?}
<A>__{joe nods no.}
<C>__{driver }
<D>__{don't you want to close his eyes?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{close them?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{just reach over and close them. that's all.}
<A>__{joe closes ratso's eyes.}
<C>__{driver }
<D>__{i guess we'll just drive on, right? nothing else to do.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no, sir. not till miami. i will see to burying then.}
<A>__{the driver moves to the front and turns to the passengers.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{just a little sickness, folks, nothing serious. we'll be in miami...}
<P>__{(looks at watch)}
<D>__{... in forty minutes.}
<L>__{interior greyhound bus day}
<A>__{joe sits stiffly, very frightened, as the bus starts on. then he glances at ratso, frowning, reaches out an arm and puts it around ratso, settling back, staring straight ahead.}
