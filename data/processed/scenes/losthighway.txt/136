<A>__{the guards release fred into the yard for his exercise. at first the sunlight is blinding, and fred covers his eyes. he moves along the wall, tentative, his fingers feeling the way. fnally he slumps down on his haunches, back leaned against the wall, eyes closed, letting the sun hit his face. very soon, however, the sun passes behind a cloud and fred is bathed in shade. fred stands up, but is almost immediately hit by a searing pain in his head. fred holds his head with his hands, sinks down to his knees. the guard, who has been observing fred from the doorway, comes over to him.}
