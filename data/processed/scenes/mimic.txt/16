<L>__{interior museum exhibit room day}
<A>__{a room of half finished exhibits. a group of sculptors most of them undergraduates work on a gigantic piece representing a termite mound. they're supervised by siri, a punkish young indian research assistant. susan talks to some of the sculptors about a 100 1 scale clay model of an insect's head. she gestures to the model's mandible set.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{...no, guys, these have to fit perfectly. no spaces in between. let me tell you why. insects have no hands. all they have is this set of mandibles.}
<A>__{she grabs the outer mandible set.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{see? this little piggy will grab the prey.}
<A>__{then unfolds a second set...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{then this little piggy will tear it in half...}
<A>__{and a third!!!}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{...and this little one will grind it to a pulp and push it in... all the way into the mouth. these are precision tools here. can you remember that?}
<A>__{the guys nod.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{good. then get it right.}
<A>__{a piece of the termite mound is raised above their heads, revealing... ...peter, at the entrance, still dressed in his jogging sweats. he smiles at susan.}
