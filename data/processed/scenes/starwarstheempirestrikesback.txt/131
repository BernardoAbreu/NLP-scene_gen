<A>__{the falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its turn, asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows. a large asteroid tumbles away from the falcon's path at top speed. several smaller asteroids crash into the big one, creating small explosions on its surface. other asteroids of all sizes pass by in every direction, some colliding and exploding. the tiny millennium falcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain of rocks, followed by four tie fighters, which bob and weave around the asteroids. one of the pursuing tie fighters connects with an asteroid and explodes. the other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of smaller explosions. two huge asteroids tumble toward the millennium falcon, which quickly banks around both of them. the three tie fighters follow in hot pursuit until one of the fighters scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out of control into deep space.}
