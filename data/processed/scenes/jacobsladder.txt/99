<L>__{interior hotel dawm}
<A>__{jacob and michael enter a sleazy hotel near the docks, obviously frequented by a gay clientele. jacob is uncomfortable as they check in. michael, however, seems to know the ropes. they go to a small room.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you come here often?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{sometimes. when it's convenient.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{how do i know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hey, i'm not the problem. you've got bigger problems than me.}
<A>__{michael reaches into his pocket and casually extracts a vial.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i came up with the formula back in nam but i never got a chance to use it.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{never?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'd hoped i'd never have to. just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{don't worry. take it. it'll free your head. come on.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(fearful)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{"yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil," but no one ever said i wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?}
<P>__{(jacob smiles, his mouth open)}
<D>__{stick out your tongue.}
<P>__{(jacob obeys as an}
<D>__{eyedropper deposits a drop of liquid on the}
<P>__{back of his tongue)}
<D>__{that'a boy. now why don't you just lie down and relax.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{one drop?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it's strong stuff.}
<A>__{jacob stretches out on the bed. he stares up at the ceiling and examines its pock marked lunar look. long cracks and shallow craters erode the surface. it is an alien terrain.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i think i'm falling asleep.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{pleasant dreams.}
<A>__{the words send a jolt through jacob's body. he tries to get up but can't. he's frightened.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i can't move.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{just relax.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what's happening? help me.}
<A>__{the ceiling begins to rumble. cracks split wide open. huge crevasses tear through the plaster. jacob's world is crumbling. he stares in horror as demonic forms attempt to surge through the rupture above him. piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the darkness. hooved feet and pointed claws clamor to break through.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{help me!}
<A>__{instantly michael appears standing over him. he is holding the vial with the antidote. he draws an eyedropper full of the fluid and holds it over jacob's mouth.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{take it!}
<A>__{jacob fights him, but michael forces the entire contents of the eyedropper down his throat. jacob gags. he tries to spit it out, but can't. suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks break off and collide like continental plates. the collisons wreak havoc on the demons, chopping and dismembering them. body parts fall from the ceiling like a devil's rain. horrible screams echo from the other side.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't fight it. it's your own mind. it's your own fears.}
<A>__{flashes of light and dark storm over jacob's head, thundering like a war in the heavens. it is a scene of raw power and growing catastrophe. it builds in fury and rage until suddenly the ceiling explodes. jacob's eyes stare into the formlessness expanding around him. all space is becoming a dark liquid void. gradually the liquid grows bluer, clearer. there is an undulating sense to the imagery, a feeling of womb like comfort. strange lights appear and sparkle before us like sunlight on the ocean. jacob is rushing upward, toward the surface. with the delirious sound of water giving way to air, jacob breaks through. to his amazement, he finds himself floating out stretched on shimmering sunlit water. above him are clouds of such wondrous beauty that they cannot possibly be of the earth. pillars of golden light reach down from the heavens creating a cathedral of light. it is a vision of heaven, a vast, almost mythic paradise. jacob is awed. a sudden movement catches his attention. he looks over and sees michael standing before him. only michael looks different. his face seems to radiate an inner light, a transcendental beauty. jacob is nearly blinded by his presence and must shield his eyes to look at him.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{so, how you doin'?}
<A>__{the casualness of the words catches jacob by surprise. he sits up. to his shock and amazement, he finds that he is back in the hotel room. michael is standing at the foot of the bed. jacob is totally disoriented. his eyes move slowly around the room, taking everything in. he doesn't speak.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it was better than you expected, huh?}
<A>__{jacob just stares at him for a while and then suddenly begins to laugh. it is a huge laugh, full of energy and life.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and no more demons. i told you they'd be gone.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i don't believe this. it's a miracle, michael. a miracle.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{better living through chemistry, that's my motto.}
