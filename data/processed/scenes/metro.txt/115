<L>__{interior garage}
<A>__{roper stands in the middle of the garage and takes a final scan... he has the discouraging feeling that korda might have escaped. he heads toward the exit... suddenly a screech of tires... roper whirls to see a sedan bearing down on him. he drives and fires! bullets shatter the windshield. the car continues toward roper. he has to roll out of the path of the car. the car swerves past roper. tries to make it down the ramp. roper fires again, taking out the rear window and a rear tire. the car slides along the guard rail and continues down to the next level. roper runs after it. garage 2nd level as the car reaches the next level, korda loses control and piles into a parked car. korda crawls out of the car clutching his precious satchel of jewels. dazed, he staggers away from the wreck. roper moves to him with a face grim as death. he strips the satchel from korda's hand and slams him against the open car door. korda goes to his knees. roper holds the barrel of his gun right up between korda's eyes.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{give me one reason why i shouldn't kill you right here.}
<A>__{korda stares back at roper defiantly. he knows a cop won't kill him in cold blood... what he doesn't know is that roper doesn't give a shit about those rules at this moment.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{you know sam baffert was a friend of mine. he had a wife... and he had a daughter.}
<A>__{korda stares past the barrel of the gun.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{i don't give a shit about you or your fucking friends.}
<A>__{and that makes roper even angrier... but he keeps it all inside. his expression is as cold as a san francisco night. he yanks back hard on korda's hair. pushes the gun tighter against korda's forehead. he's on the verge of executing this guy.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{you can't kill me like this.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{what if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?}
<A>__{in a flash, roper points the gun upward and fires off a shot!}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{could i kill you then?}
<P>__{(beat, beat)}
<D>__{could i kill you then?}
<A>__{roper jams the gun back under korda's chin. a pull of the trigger would send a bullet straight up through korda's skull. and now korda is fully convinced. he squeezes his eyes closed. face straining so hard, he looks like he's going to burst out of his skin. angle mccall moving across garage into position.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{roper! put it down!... put it down man, we got him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{come on... put it down.}
<A>__{long, long beat. roper eases up and korda smiles. just when we feel the scene is over, roper turns back quickly and kicks korda in the stomach, then grabs korda by the hair, pulls his head back and shoves the gun in his face.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{we do this shit by the book, but you ain't gonna be smiling.}
<A>__{korda is doubled up coughing, spitting up blood. roper walks away as mccall moves in to put the cuffs on korda.}
