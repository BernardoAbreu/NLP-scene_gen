<A>__{helen opens the door of mark's sitting room. we hear mark call out from the inner room:}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{would you... please... wait in there?... developing.}
<A>__{helen goes in, closing the door behind her.}
<L>__{interior mark's sitting room evening}
<A>__{helen enters. she speaks loudly to be heard in the dark room.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{mother heard you come in so i guessed you wouldn't be in bed ...}
<A>__{no reply from the inner room.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{are you sure this is conven...}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{won't be long!}
<A>__{helen glances at her watch... then looks curiously round the room. close shot of vivian's recorder, placed on a chair. close shot of helen. she picks it up and looks at it, curiously, fingering the stops.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{hallo.}
<A>__{helen turns round. mark is standing on the threshold of the dark room.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{hallo, mark...}
<A>__{he walks towards her... he stops suddenly. he is staring at the recorder in her hand.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i hope you don't mind is it a tape recorder?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{gently he takes it from her as if it is a cup with which she has finished and replaces it on the shelf. close shot of helen.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm sure i'm being a nuisance... but, mark, i very much want to...}
<A>__{her voice trails away. close shot of mark. he is holding out a small package.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{happy birthday.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{mark! that's very sweet of you but really.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it isn't much... i don't know anything about... presents for twenty one... but i saw it this morning... so... please.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{thank you...}
<A>__{she takes the package, and unwraps it. inside is a slender brooch}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it's beautiful...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i like the design... more milk?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{more?... no, thank you, mark... and i really appreciate this... i'm going to put it on now.}
<A>__{he watches her hold it against her dress.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{there?... or there?...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{the first place...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i think so too!...}
<A>__{close shot of helen pinning it on. close shot of mark touching his lapel. close shot of helen glancing at her watch. close shot of mark glancing at his. he thinks of the ticking clock in the dark room. helen looks up, and sees him.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i am keeping you.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no... i promise.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{mark, i'm here for some advice.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{from me? please...}
<A>__{he looks as if he has just been voted the best cameraman of the year (unanimously) and the two films he directed have both won oscars (though don jarvis understood them). his delighted astonishment is such that she has to smile.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{... i work in a public library in the children's section... i'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me...}
<A>__{she takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{in my spare time... i write.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what's embar...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i write stories for children... but so did grimm... hans andersen... lewis carroll...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{had any published?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{some short stories.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'd like to read...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i learned today... that my first book... has been accepted! ... for publication in the spring...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{but that's wonderful... what's it about?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{a magic camera and what it photographs...}
<A>__{close shot of mark.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{whatever made you... think of that?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i will tell you one day i promise...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well what does it photograph?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i will tell you that too but, mark... this is the problem... the children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and suggest drawings... but i don't agree.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no nothing's impossible.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{was hoping you'd say that! there must be photographs however difficult to take and i was wondering, mark if you'd...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{oh yes.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{discuss it with me.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{take them.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{mark i can't ask you to do that...}
<A>__{they have cancelled his oscar.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i mean... the publisher's mightn't agree.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'd take them... for you.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes but... the money.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{there are some things... which i photograph... for nothing.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i didn't mean to offend you.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{offend?}
<A>__{close shot of mark.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{helen... if you knew what it meant... for something to happen to me... that i don't have to make happen... it's like... you've given me a twenty first birthday...}
<A>__{close shot of helen looking at him...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what does your camera photograph?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{mark i must go... i just wanted to know... if you'd talk it over with me.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{when please?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that's up to you.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{helen ... i don't know much about... dinner out... but would you come with me?}
<C>__{helen}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it had better be soon...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{are you going away?}

<C>__{helen}
<D>__{thank you for listening... and for my present.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{and for mine.}
<A>__{they look at each other in silence.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{good night, mark...}
<P>__{(turning to the door)}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{good night... helen...}
<A>__{he watches her leave, standing very still. offstage, the time clock explodes. close shot the excited clock. mark's hand silences it.}
