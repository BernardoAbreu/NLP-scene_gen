<A>__{it's now a pattern of white dots that changes the more starks stares at it. beneath it seems to be a smaller pattern with formless shapes and figures that starks tries to discern before they change into something else. only after starks blinks does he start to see the white of the dots is snow from a picture that is slowly and terribly coming together in the following glimpses, each hardly longer than the time between blinks. 1) a little river of red marring the snow around it, spilling from... 2) officer harrison's mouth just seconds before his last breath. his eyes close and starks sees and hears a flash... 3) from the barrel of a gun fired near him. blood sprays starks' hands as he looks down at them and realizes he's in the scene and not just watching it. he looks up from his hands and sees in similar flashes... 1) the snow beneath the blood changing to dirt as starks stares at it. this time, the little river of red comes from... 2) the bodies of iraqi villagers, all still except one... 3) that of a iraqi woman. she unflinchingly lays her hand in the entrails of a corpse and smears its blood on her face just before she lies back down among the dead, content to be one of them. the only sounds during these dreadful images have been a trapped man's anxious breaths and the beats of a heart pumping so fast it could be a drum... the screen goes black and quivers as starks clenches his eyes shut.}
