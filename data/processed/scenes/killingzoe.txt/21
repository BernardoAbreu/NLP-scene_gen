<L>__{interior eric's flat living room night}
<A>__{eric's flat consists of a good sized living room area with a connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back. in the front of the living room there is a small balcony where the sounds of the city pour in. the room itself is a general mess. a bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor. hung up on the wall is a huge, french "dressed to kill" poster. some brazilian gilberto getz music is playing. sitting at the table playing cards are three men: francois, ricardo, and jean. sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is claude and oliver. they all turn as zed and eric walk in.}
