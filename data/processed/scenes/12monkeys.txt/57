<A>__{railly glances in the mirror, sees cole settling back wearily against the seat. she says carefully...}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{i can't believe this is a coincidence, mr. cole. have you been...following me?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you told me you'd help me. i know this isn't what you meant, but...i was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. i probably smell bad. sorry about that. but then i saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.}
<P>__{(sudden pride)}
<D>__{i can read, remember?}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{yes, i remember.}
<P>__{(a beat, then)}
<D>__{why do you want to go to philadelphia?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{it's the next step. i checked out the baltimore information, it was nothing. it's philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.}
<P>__{(pointing suddenly, eagerly)}
<D>__{zs that a radio? does it play music?}
<A>__{railly turns on the radio and immediately we hear the sound of surf and the cries of gulls, background to an oozing baritone commercial.}
<P>__{commercial radio (o.s.)}
<D>__{this is a personal message to you.}
<A>__{cole sits up, alert, listening intently.}
<P>__{commercial radio (cont. o.s.)}
<D>__{are you at the end of your rope? are you dying to get away?}
<A>__{cole's eyes narrow, concentrating on this personal message.}
<D>__{commercail radio (cont. o.s.} the florida keys are waiting for you.}
<A>__{cole frowns as the sound of breaking surf and crying gulls fills the car. it's confusing! he blurts out...}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i've never seen the ocean!}
<A>__{observing his confusion in the mirror, railly assumes her professional tone.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{it's an advertisement, mr. cole. you do understand that, don't you? it's not really a special message to you.}
<A>__{cole frowns. he did think it was for him, but she's probably right.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you used to call me "james".}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{you'd prefer that? ... james...you don't really have a gun, do you.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(cynical laugh)}
<D>__{everybody's got a gun. in this city...}
<A>__{he breaks off reacting to the radio music! fats domino singing "blueberry hill"! cole grins, mouth agape, eyes wide like a kid's.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{can you...can you make it louder? i love hearing twentieth century music! hearing music and breathing air!}
<A>__{as railly cranks up the volume, she watches the mirror incredulously, sees him stick his head out the window into the wind, mouth open, "eating" the air hungrily.}
