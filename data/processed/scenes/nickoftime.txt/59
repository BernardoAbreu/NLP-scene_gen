<A>__{hidden by potted plants and campaign posters at the fringe of the crowd, gene confronts krista, covering her with the pocketed gun. in the background, eleanor grant delivers a ringing speech, accented with applause.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{please...please...you have to believe me... they have my daughter. they want me to kill eleanor grant or they'll kill my daughter.}
<A>__{krista tries to edge away.}
<C>__{krista}
<D>__{all right, let's just...let's get security in on this.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{no! you can't! they're in on it.}
<C>__{krista}
<D>__{i don't see how they could be in on it. they're the best. they're hand picked.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{i don't know. one of them is following me. if he knew what i'd just told you they'd...}
<A>__{gene pulls the gun from his pocket. she recoils, thinking he's going to shoot her.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{look, how did i get in here with this!?}
<A>__{krista stares at the gun. she can't deny the fact.}
<C>__{krista}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{you've got to trust me. i'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. she's only six. she's just a little girl. please, please, trust me.}
<C>__{krista}
<D>__{it's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.}
<A>__{gene looks at her intently.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{you're right, it is.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{gene offers krista the gun. she is surprised, to say the least. she takes it gingerly, with only the tips of her fingers.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{will you trust me now?}
<A>__{she stares at the gun, at the strange man.}
<C>__{krista}
<D>__{i guess i will have to. come on, there's one person we can go to.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{the man following me has a walkie talkie. if he sees i'm not here he'll call his partner. i do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.}
<C>__{krista}
<D>__{he'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. wait a minute.}
<A>__{she steps closer to the platform listens. eleanor grant's voice is heard.}
<C>__{eleanor grant }
<D>__{...i remember that horrible night as if it were yesterday. a phone call pulling me out of sleep, the terrible news...}
<A>__{krista checks her watch.}
