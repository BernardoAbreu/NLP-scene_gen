<A>__{fury makes his way over to erik selvig.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{talk to me, doctor.}
<C>__{selvig}
<D>__{director.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{is there anything we know for certain?}
<C>__{selvig}
<D>__{the tesseract is misbehaving.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{is that supposed to be funny?}
<C>__{selvig}
<D>__{no, it’s not funny at all. the tesseract is not only active, she’s misbehaving.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{how soon can you pull the plug?}
<C>__{selvig}
<D>__{she’s an energy source. we turn off the power, she turns it back on. if she reaches peak level }
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{we prepared for this, doctor. harnessing energy from space.}
<C>__{selvig}
<D>__{we don’t have the harness. my calculations are far from complete. she’s throwing off interference, radiation. nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{that can be harmful. where’s agent barton?}
<C>__{selvig}
<D>__{the hawk? up in his nest, as usual.}
<A>__{clint barton, also known as hawkeye, is on a balcony, observing the lab.}
<C>__{fury}
<P>__{(over barton’s radio)}
<D>__{agent barton. report.}
<A>__{barton zip lines down a rope.}
<C>__{fury }
<P>__{(sturn)}
<D>__{i gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things.}
<A>__{fury and barton walk together toward the tesseract machine.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i see better from a distance.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{have you seen anything that might set this thing off?}
<A>__{a nasa scientist calls for selvig.}
<C>__{nasa scientist}
<D>__{doctor! it’s spiking again.}
<A>__{barton and fury step onto the platform, in front of the tesseract machine.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{no one’s come and gone. and selvig’s clean. no contacts, no im. if there’s any tampering, sir, it wasn’t this end.}
<A>__{while barton is talking selvig walks over to the computer where the nasa scientist is. he looks concerned and worried.}
<C>__{fury}
<P>__{(a little confused)}
<D>__{at this end?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{yeah. the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? doors open from both sides.}
<A>__{the cube sparks.}
<C>__{selvig}
<D>__{what’s that?}
<A>__{it sparks again.}
