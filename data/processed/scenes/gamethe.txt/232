<D>__{yo!}
<A>__{angle into garage the gate guard jogs toward the elevators, pulling his gun. schuyler starts to panic, pulls his own gun and points it at the guard, who freezes and raises his hands. behind him, the security man approaches schuyler from a different angle, his gun out. schuyler can't get a bead on both of them.}
<C>__{security man}
<D>__{you're a dead man.}
<A>__{schuyler looks one more time at the elevator panel at base of panel, a gold keyhole. closer the letters crs are printed beneath it, very small. schuyler shakes his head it couldn't be; but what else can he do? angle into garage the guards are fanning out and getting closer. schuyler reaches with one hand for his keys, fumbling for the small gold key he received at the start of the game. on panel his hand shakes as he tries to insert the gold key... it fits into the hole; he turns it and pushes the button for 12. wider as the doors close, both guards train their guns but too late. schuyler's on his way up.}
