<A>__{the 5th floor is a little used storage level stacked boxes, dusty file cabinets, garbage everywhere ... starkly lit with harsh overhead fixtures as old as the building itself. we recognize this as the room kaylo called from ... more so because his limp body is still duct taped to the rolling office chair, now lying on its side in the middle of the room. a half dozen more hoods are gathered in front of the freight elevator when chev appears behind them, taking everyone by surprise. he’s standing over kaylo’s body, gun drawn, eve’s beaded purse still slung over his shoulder, pissing fire.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{alright, where is that motherfucker?}
<A>__{the hoods are completely taken by surprise; they back away from chev, spreading out.}
<D>__{hood #3 uh ... hey, chev.}
<A>__{the hoods act almost guilty ... it’s obvious everyone knows each other.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{what the fuck is this? hood #1 chevy, baby, take it easy.}
<A>__{chev points the gun at hood #1’s head; the others raise their guns at him.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{like this? where’s verona? hood #1 verona got nothing to do with this.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{what? hood #1 don carlos wants you off the street.}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{carlito? hood #1 you’ve totally lost your shit, dude ... you’re all over the tv ... destroying property, making unauthorized hits ... you’re causing the organization a great deal of embarrassment.}
<A>__{chev gestures toward kaylo in disbelief.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{carlito ordered this? hood #1}
<P>__{(ignoring it)}
<D>__{look, forget about verona. we’ll take care of him. the best thing for you to do is to find a nice, dark, quiet place and just ... die.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{just die. hood #1 yeah. just ... die.}
<A>__{chev’s heartbeat starts to slow. the wooden elevator starts down. he looks around, making eye contact with the other}
<B>__{hoods ...}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{maybe you’re right.}
<A>__{... then down to kaylo’s crumpled body. he sees the stocking feet, the pumps ... his heart starts to jitter thudub ... lub ... thudub ... his vision doubles ... he starts to swoon}
<B>__{...}
<D>__{hood #1}
<P>__{(rationalizing)}
<D>__{i mean we all gotta die sometime, right?}
<A>__{hood #1 snickers. the others share a tense laugh.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{that’s true ... we all gotta die ...}
<A>__{chev stumbles, props himself up with one hand.}
<P>__{chev (cont’d)}
<D>__{right ... so ... let’s all die ... hood #1 eh?}
<A>__{chev brings up his gun in the blink of an eye, draws a bead on hood #1 and is about to set off a shooting gallery, when the elevator bell chimes and the door slides open. eve walks in... looks around, and freezes. they all turn to look.}
<P>__{hood #1 (cont’d)}
<D>__{what the...?}
<A>__{chev affords himself about a second and a half of bug eyed shock before snapping out of it and dropping hood #1}
<B>__{instantly with a shot to the head.}
<A>__{chaos breaks out as the others dive for cover and start blasting. chev yanks kaylo’s chair up and shoves it toward the hoods then makes a break for the elevator shaft, grabbing eve as he goes. kaylo’s body screens chev and eve as they run, taking hits, finally toppling over again. chev takes out another hood on the run, nailing him right between the eyes. chev turns his back on the hoods, covering eve, as they make a dive into the open elevator shaft and takes a bullet in the}

<C>__{chev}
<D>__{ow!}
<A>__{he spins and empties his clip at the hoods, who hit the deck. eve holds his ass as chev looks down the open elevator shaft. the elevator is half a floor down, moving slow. he grabs eve, then the cable... they jump for it.}
