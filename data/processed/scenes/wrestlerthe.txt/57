<A>__{hellbilly cannibal climbs into the ring with his sack and a folding chair. he heads to the center of the ring, where randy awaits. they sit down on chairs facing each other. under hellbilly cannibal's chair is his canvas sack. under randy's is his dollar tree plastic shopping bag. hellbilly cannibal punches randy. randy punches hellbilly cannibal. they take turns punching each other, each shot a little harder than the last. it's like a violent game of "slaps". after a stretch of this, hellbilly cannibal reaches into his sack and pulls out a can of bug spray. he sprays it in randy's face. randy falls off his chair. he staggers around the ring clutching his face, howling in agony. hellbilly cannibal smashes the blinded randy over the head with his chair. randy falls to his knees. hellbilly cannibal reaches into his sack and pulls out a fluorescent light tube. wielding it like a bat, he smacks randy in the face. the tube explodes with a pop. grabbing a folding chair, hellbilly cannibal charges toward randy. he takes a flying leap, riding the chair like a boogie board. just as he's about to crash down on randy, randy rolls out of the way. hellbilly cannibal's spine gets a violent jolt as the chair hits the mat. randy reaches into his dollar tree bag and pulls out an aluminum cookie tray. he smacks hellbilly cannibal in the face with it. the tray makes an awesomely loud metallic clang. randy hits him a bunch more times. randy is starting to get winded. his heart beats faster. he picks up hellbilly cannibal and flings him toward the ropes. hellbilly cannibal, bouncing off, ducks randy's awaiting forearm. he bounces off the opposite ropes and crashes into randy knee first. hellbilly cannibal grabs randy by the hair and smashes his face into the corner post. he scoops him up and flips him over the top rope, out of the ring. randy lands hard on the concrete floor. hellbilly cannibal hops out of the ring with the folding chair. he whales randy in the face with it. randy stumbles backwards toward the metal barricade between the ring and the fans. hellbilly cannibal kicks him in the chest. randy flips over the barricade, into the crowd. fans scatter in an exhilarated panic. hellbilly cannibal throws randy into a row of empty chairs. randy goes sprawling. chairs fly everywhere. randy gets up. his heart is beating loud. fast. randy, dazed, heads toward the snack bar area. hellbilly cannibal follows after him. randy grabs a metal garbage can and whips around with it, smacking hellbilly cannibal square in the face. hellbilly cannibal goes down. randy shakes out the can's contents over hellbilly cannibal, showering him in trash. he shoves hellbilly cannibal's head into the can and falls on it, ass first. randy grabs the ladder resting along the base of the ring. he pounds the garbage can with it, making an unholy racket. with the can still over his head, hellbilly cannibal rises to his feet. he headbutts randy with the can. randy, stumbling around, gets headbutted again. hellbilly cannibal throws off the can and drags randy back to the ring by his hair, carrying the ladder in his other hand. plopping randy down on the mat, hellbilly cannibal sets up the ladder in the middle of the ring. he heads back out and grabs the folding table, setting it up by the ladder. he reaches into randy's dollar tree bag and pulls out a box of thumbtacks. he scatters the tacks all over the table. hellbilly cannibal grabs randy and pulls him up the ladder with him. they stand at the top, perched high above the table. just as hellbilly cannibal is about to push off, randy surprises him with a vicious head butt. hellbilly cannibal is caught totally off guard. randy headbutts him again. randy grabs hellbilly cannibal and pushes off. in mid air, randy does a 180 twist, causing hellbilly cannibal to crash through the table with randy on top of him. hellbilly cannibal rolls around the mat in a daze, his back bloodied and covered with tacks. he staggers to his feet. randy hits him with a dropkick. randy's heartbeat is deafening. all other sounds drop out. randy pulls hellbilly cannibal off the mat. as he gears up for another dropkick, his knees buckle. a look comes over his face. he drops to his knees, one hand on the mat. randy grabs his arm. he massages it. he flops over, clutching his chest. he lies on his back gasping for breath, sucking at the air. randy's pov: the fans are unaware anything is wrong. they assume it's part of the act. hellbilly cannibal sees a look of fear in randy's eyes. he knows this is real. he looks out at the crowd.}

<D>__{put him down.}
<A>__{they lower him to the mat. lex hops out of the ring and grabs randy's ankles. several of the other guys hop out of the ring, supporting randy's underside as they carefully, awkwardly pull him out. by now, the crowd realizes this is real. they surge forward as difusco and the wrestlers carry randy toward the exit.}
