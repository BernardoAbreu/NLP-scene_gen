<L>__{interior lord west's office day}
<A>__{roderick and lord west.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i insist upon being allowed to appear before his majesty and clear myself of the imputations against me, to point out my services to the government, and to ask when the reward, that had been promised me, the title held by my ancestors, is again to be revived in my person.}
<A>__{there is a sleepy coolness in the fat lord west. he hears roderick with half shut eyes. when he finishes his violent speech, which he has made striding about the room, lord west opens one eye, smiles, and says:}
<C>__{lord west}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{have you done, mr. cosgrove?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{lord west}
<D>__{well, mr. cosgrove, i will answer you point by pointerior the king is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know. your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and his majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet. as for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please. and, now, as i have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which i can oblige you.}
<A>__{so saying, lord west raises his hand lazily to the bell, and bows roderick out.}
