<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{he stares off through the windshield. he is really puzzled. he steals a look at sue. he starts to put his arm around her; she moves a little, subtly but clearly. tommy stares off into space again.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i never thought about her. i mean, she wasn't someone you had to think about.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{she was always there keeping to herself in that stupid dress that weird mother.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know what i mean?}
<A>__{sue glances toward him. of course she knows. and he is beginning to understand. tommy looks straight ahead again. he is starting to think. it's not all that easy.}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(almost under his breath)}
<D>__{carrie white?}
<A>__{it does come out as a question.}
