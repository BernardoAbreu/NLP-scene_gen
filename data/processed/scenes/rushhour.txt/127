<A>__{at the complex intersection where highland ends at the 101, javal bears to the right, toward the south on ramp. sabatini and dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it. suddenly, he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van into reverse. he backs off the on ramp, past a row of angry drivers, passing by sabatini and dave. peeling in reverse onto highland, javal stomps on the brakes. the snap buckles holding the ice cream truck superstructure around his van break apart, and the whole thing slides off... blocking sabatini's way. javal drives forward again, this time getting onto the 101 north on ramp.}
