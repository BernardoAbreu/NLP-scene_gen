<A>__{he nods ... the boys are huddled together...}
<C>__{mirror man}
<D>__{poor toby, man...}
<A>__{a few beats of silence as they remember; then shockingly:}
<C>__{the sphinx}
<D>__{if his premature demise has, in some way, enlightened the rest of you as to the grim finish below the glossy veneer of criminal life, and inspired you to change your ways, then his death carries with it an inherent nobility. and a supreme glory. we should all be so fortunate. you can say 'poor toby." i say: "poor us.."}
<A>__{they all stare at him, stunned...}
<C>__{freb}
<D>__{you spoke}
<A>__{the sphinx shrugs...}
<C>__{tumbler}
<D>__{say something else, man}
<A>__{but the sphinx lapses back into his silence ... nibbles a donut ... sips coffee ... memphis smiles ... he takes a stack of bills from the briefcase... to kip:}
