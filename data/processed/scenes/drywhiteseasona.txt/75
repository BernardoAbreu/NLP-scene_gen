<A>__{the car approaches a huge perimeter notice: "you are now entering soweto township. no person without the necessary permit is allowed..." ben is driven into a different world; children playing in dirty streets, in wrecks of cars, open spaces devoid of vegetables, smoke from large rubbish dumps, burnt out skeletons of buses, beer halls and buildings. clusters of policemen in battle dress patrolling in the distance.}
