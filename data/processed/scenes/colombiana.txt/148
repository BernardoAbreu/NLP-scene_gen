<L>__{exterior pepe's warehouse home day}
<A>__{a ramshackle warehouse, it's windows streaked opaque with years of dust and grime, surrounded by a fence, and a weedy garden which is home to dozens of the most unique wind chimes of all sizes and shapes, made from scrap metal. and two of the biggest, most ferocious dogs on earth, laying on their sides, asleep. the dog's ears perk up; hearing something we don't, a low growl begins to rumble deep in their throats. the gate to the garden begins to open, and like a shot the dogs are up, hurling themselves toward the opening gate, eyes flashing, barking loud enough to scare the dead back to life, fangs bared, ready to kill. and then they stop cold when they see who it is coming into their domain.}
<B>__{reverse on cat}
<A>__{holding two very full shopping bags.}

<D>__{ok. ok. now sit.}
<A>__{the dogs obey her in a heartbeat, sitting expectantly. not making a sound.}

<A>__{the dogs can barely contain themselves.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{red, juicy, delicious.}
<A>__{the dogs whimper in anticipation.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{stay.}
<A>__{she picks up the shopping bags, and heads for the ramshackle warehouse. the dogs moan, but do not move, their eyes going from the meat to cat. cat reaches the door. turns. sees the dogs looking at her.}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{good boys.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{eat.}
<A>__{the dogs pounce. each one grabs a roast and tears into the meat with ferocious, pent up glee. cat smiles at the sight, enters the warehouse.}
