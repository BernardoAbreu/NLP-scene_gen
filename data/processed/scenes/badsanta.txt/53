<L>__{interior black angus bar night}
<A>__{a large faux rustic bar filled to capacity with loosened tie middle management. crammed at the far end of the bar, willie stands out like a sore thumb in this thirty ish crowd. we follow his gaze all around the perimeter of the room until it connects with the drunken, glowering face of a hindustani troublemaker, sitting right across from him, startling willie for a moment. willie regains his composure, then gives the guy a puzzled look back, and amused by the guy's unflinching anger, raises his glass in a toast to him as if to say, "whatever... cheers, you nutcase", and turns back to his drink. the man stands up and, never releasing his stare, moves right up to willie, two inches from his face. willie looks up.}
