<L>__{interior caroline's room.}
<A>__{caroline at her desk, sketching. her door is ajar. ally enters, mouth agape as she lays eyes on caroline's collection of artwork on the walls.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{caroline's working on a portrait of tyler on a park bench, cigarette dangling from his bottom lip. a perfect rendering of a fleeting moment.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{caroline shrugs. ally looks over caroline's shoulder.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{that's exactly him. it's like the cigarette is the last coca cola in the desert.}
<A>__{caroline smiles.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{i can't believe he smokes in front of you.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{don't worry, i'm not that impressionable.}
<A>__{ally smiles. caroline goes back to work. ally looks around at all the portraits papering her walls. it stirs a memory.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{you know when i was younger, we didn't have air conditioning in the house, so during the summer my mom and i would go to museums to cool down... she loved them all but the met was always her favorite.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{mine too. the met is one of my favorite places in the world.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{so... i heard you've got an art exhibit coming up.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{you wanna come?}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{was it that obvious? but only if you're ok with it. i don't want to impose and i will completely understand if you don't want some random girl there.}
<A>__{caroline considers this.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you're not random... you're tyler's girlfriend.}
<A>__{ally has never heard anyone say it so plainly. she seems a bit perplexed, then grins. it's okay with her.}
