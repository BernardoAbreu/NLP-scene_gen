<A>__{elle waits for warner, alone at a table. checking her watch to see it's 8:45, she tries not to be sad.}
<L>__{interior harvard law library day}
<A>__{warner and his study group, sarah and claire included, sit at a table, going over their outlines. elle walks up to the table, holding a basket of muffins, bright smile on her face.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{i ' m here to join your study group. and look! i brought sustenance!}
<A>__{she holds up the muffins as the others look up, frowns all around.}
<C>__{warner}
<P>__{(nervously looking at sarah)}
<D>__{elle, what're you doing here?}
<A>__{elle pulls up a chair from another table and holds up a muffin.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{who's first?}
<A>__{she sits down next to warner.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{our group is full.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{oh, god, was this like an rsvp thing?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{no, it's like a smart people thing. and like sarah said, we're full.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{come on we can make room for one more.}
<A>__{sarah looks at warner with evil eyes.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{we've already assigned the outlines, and everyone has started theirs',}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(to warner)}
<D>__{besides, you wouldn't let the fat guy join.}
<C>__{warner}
<D>__{he tried to watch me take'a shower!}
<A>__{sarah looks at elle.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{the answer is no.}
<A>__{warner looks at her, feeling guilty. he shrugs an "i'm sorry", but elle's perkiness has gone. she gathers up her muffins and stands, clutching the basket to her chest as she goes.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{then i guess i will leave you alone.}
<A>__{she walks away, completely deflated, passing by the raging feminist study group. enid calls out.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{maybe there's a sorority you could join instead.}
<A>__{elle stops and looks at her.}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(to enid)}
<D>__{you know, if you'd come to a rush party, i would've at least been nice to you.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{before you voted against me and called me a dyke behind my back?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{i don't use that word. only mean people use that word. you must've heard it from sarah.}
<A>__{she looks back at warner's table and walks off. as she does., she's nearly mowed down by a gaggle of nerds led by dorky david, who knock the muffins out of her hands. she stands there, even more depressed.}
