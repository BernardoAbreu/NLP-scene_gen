<L>__{interior station day}
<A>__{looking up a long escalator, the jewish boy riding down toward us. suede head arrives on the run at the top, races down a flight of stairs, vaults the bannister, slides down a metal slope.... lands on his feet and comes to stand at the foot of the escalator. the boy rides inexorably down. at the bottom, he tries to go around suede head who blocks this way, then another, driving him into a corner. the boy realizes he has nowhere to go finally turns to face his tormentor. their eyes meet for the first time. he is actually bigger than suede head, but not nearly as strong. he won't fight, is simply acknowledging what he can no longer deny. there is even an odd relief that disgusts suede head more than all the rest.}
<D>__{suede head fucking kike.}
<A>__{he slaps him in the face. he stumbles backward. as suede head goes to hit him again, the boy holds his books in front of him. suede head punches the books straight into his face. the boy falls, curls into a fetal position. suede head kicks him....}
<D>__{suede head get up.... get the fuck up....}
<A>__{he won't budge. suede head punches him repeatedly until he hears voices approaching. he runs back up the stairs to the train and only as we follow him do we realize that he is our protagonist. this is danny grown up.}
