<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior resurrection city night}
<A>__{townspeople along the main street. a sense of urgency something's going on.}
<C>__{picard }
<D>__{and it appears the vulcan ship has detected the warp signature and is now on its way to earth.}
<A>__{suddenly something in the night sky catches their attention. a bright light is moving down towards the city. we now realize this is what people are reacting to...}
<B>__{just outside of town}
<A>__{just a hundred yards beyond the city limits we see the massive vulcan scout ship settling down onto the ground. dust flying everywhere. windmill blades spinning wildly from the exhaust.}
<B>__{the townspeople}
<A>__{squinting into the wind, trying to make out what's happening... new angle on a hilltop a good distance away, but with a good view of the entire scene. riker, worf, beverly, troi and geordi watching from a distance as the vulcan ship lands.}
<B>__{just outside of town}
<A>__{picard, ruby and a bandaged, but much healthier zephram cochrane watching the landing. people from town are surging around them. everyone is shocked and amazed at what they're seeing. picard watches with satisfaction this is the moment he's been waiting for. cochrane and ruby are particularly awestruck.}
<B>__{the vulcan ship}
<A>__{settles, engines whining down... dust settling.}
<B>__{picard}
<A>__{moves to cochrane, takes him gently by the arm.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{doctor cochrane... this is your moment.}
<A>__{cochrane looks a little bewildered, tries to grapple with the moment.}
<C>__{cochrane}
<D>__{my god... they're really from another world?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{that's right. and they're going to want to meet the man who flew that warp ship.}
<A>__{cochrane looks at him.}
<C>__{cochrane}
<D>__{and that's supposed to be me...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{zephram, you had the vision to build that ship when no one else on this planet could see beyond their own problems.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you flew that ship... all i did was push a few buttons.}
<A>__{cochrane looks at him for a moment... takes a breath, nods...}
<C>__{cochrane}
<D>__{all right.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and don't worry i will keep your secret.}
<A>__{they hear a mechanical whirr and a hiss of air.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{as a hatch opens on the vulcan ship. the townspeople behind them react with shock and fear... a few people take a step back. picard looks at cochrane, who hesitates for a moment... then finally takes a deep breath... and strides out toward the alien ship. a man alone about to change the course of human history. ruby moves closer to picard and puts her arm around him... and he puts his arm around her.}
<B>__{hilltop}
<A>__{as the rest of our crew is enraptured by the moment... they glance at each other with excitement as they watch history unfold...}
<B>__{vulcan ship}
<A>__{cochrane stops a few feet away from the ship as the hatch swings completely open... light streams out into the night air... and three hooded, robed figures emerge. they stand across from cochrane a moment frozen in time.}
<B>__{the townspeople}
<A>__{watching in awe...}
<B>__{picard and ruby}
<A>__{watching...}
<B>__{the lead vulcan}
<A>__{pulls his hood back, revealing the familiar slanted eyebrows and pointed ears, holding himself with that austere, regal dignity we've come to associate with his race. he steps forward to greet cochrane... raises his hand as if to wave. cochrane raises his hand automatically, as if to wave in return... but then the vulcan splits his fingers in the classic vulcan greeting.}
<C>__{vulcan}
<D>__{live long and prosper.}
<A>__{cochrane tries to emulate the vulcan hand sign...but can't quite do the awkward finger split.}
<C>__{cochrane}
<D>__{um... thanks.}
<A>__{the vulcan cocks an eyebrow at him. the very first alien human relationship is underway...}
<B>__{picard and ruby}
<A>__{are now surrounded by townspeople, who are watching the scene unfold...}
<B>__{hilltop}
<A>__{our heroes share a glance with each other and smile, riker taps his combadge.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{riker to enterprise. five to beam up.}
<A>__{the crew dematerializes...}
<B>__{picard and ruby}
<A>__{have now moved away from the crowd... no one paying attention to them. the bright lights from the vulcan ship cast them in a dramatic silhouette. picard turns to ruby. it's the moment he's been dreading. this is goodbye. she looks at him.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{you're leaving, aren't you?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i have to...}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{where? and don't tell me san francisco...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{no. it's a lot further than that.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{it's the future, isn't it? just like you told scrimm.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i knew you weren't from around here.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(with humor)}
<D>__{no... i'm from france.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{i don't care if you're from france or venus... just take me with you.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{that's impossible.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{this may be hard for you to understand... but i'm duty bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{you've been interfering with my life ever since i met you.}
<P>__{(with meaning)}
<D>__{don't stop now.}
<A>__{picard struggles... he doesn't want to do this, but he's torn between his heart and his duty.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{ruby... i'm sorry.}
<P>__{(remembering his words to beverly)}
<D>__{but our fates lie along different paths.}
<A>__{a long, difficult moment... then he lets her go... turns and starts walking off into the night. she stands where she is, watching him go with tears in her eyes... picard hits his combadge.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{picard to enterprise. one to...}
<A>__{he stops where he is.}
<C>__{riker's com voice}
<D>__{riker here. captain, we didn't get your whole transmission.}
<A>__{picard turns, looks back at ruby. their eyes meet... and he makes the decision.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{to hell with fate.}
<C>__{riker's com voice}
<D>__{say again, captain?}
<A>__{he starts walking towards her. she sees him coming... starts running to him. she throws herself into his arms and he holds her close. they kiss. a magical moment, then...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{enterprise. two to beam up.}
<A>__{they dematerialize holding each other tight...}
