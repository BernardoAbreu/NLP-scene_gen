<L>__{interior young edward's bedroom day}
<A>__{young edward lies in bed, his limbs connected to various pulleys and levers to support his weight. he has a dozen encyclopedias around him, and another dozen on the floor.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{my muscles couldn't keep up with my bones, and my bones couldn't keep up with my body's ambition. so i spent the better part of three years confined to my bed, with the world book encyclopedia being my only means of exploration. i had made it all the way to the "g's," hoping to find an answer to my gigantificationism, when i uncovered an article about the common goldfish.}
<A>__{insert: the encyclopedia article, complete with drawings.}
<C>__{young edward}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"kept in a small bowl, the goldfish will remain small. with more space, the fish can grow double, triple, or quadruple its size."}
<A>__{young edward thinks this through.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{it occurred to me then, that perhaps the reason for my growth was that i was intended for larger things. after all, a giant man can't have an ordinary sized life.}
