<C>__{conor}
<D>__{he told me there could be only one.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: the game.}
<P>__{(conor confused)}
<D>__{you and i conor, we are different from all others around us. you know this, you can feel it. we are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,}
<P>__{(looks away)}
<D>__{permanently.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{you are still so very young.}

<D>__{listen to me. hear the words.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{this is madness!}
<C>__{romirez}
<D>__{it is the truth.}
<C>__{conor}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{romirez suddenly draws his sword and thrusts it into conor's heart. the boy's mouth drops open in shocked terror as his eyes roll up into his head. a shudder, then conor slides off the blade and crashes to the ground.}
