<A>__{garvey has left the spot where we saw him look up to rocklin's window. we now see him as he rounds a rear corner of the building and goes toward the outer stairs leading to the sun up's second floor. he starts up the steps and stops almost immediately and stares o.s.}
<B>__{angel}
<A>__{from garvey's angle as he sees dave bringing clint from around in front of the building toward the stairway.}
<B>__{camera holds}
<A>__{garvey steps quickly to the ground and takes up a position around the roar corner. he watches the two men approach the stairway and go up. he moves out of the shot now, going toward the street. the camera holds on the corner, and we see tala come into view, as though from nowhere, and take the exact position at the building's corner vacated by garvey only a moment before. it is apparent that he is watching garvey, and after a momentary pause he too moves stealthily out of the scene.}
