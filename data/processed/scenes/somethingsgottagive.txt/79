<A>__{erica sits alone at a table in the back of the room, drinking a glass of wine. she looks vibrant. she glances up from her drink and sees what looks like harry making his way around the tables. she leans to the side for a better look, to make sure it's him. it is him and he's corning right toward her. her stomach sinks, her mind races... and before she can come up with a single thought that makes any sense there he is.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(proud of himself)}
<D>__{i knew you'd be here.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i've come a long way to see you, erica.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you mean we're not bumping into each other..? you came here to see me?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yes, i did.}
<P>__{(she seems to shiver)}
<D>__{i'm aware it was a bold move, one of those impulses that grabs you,' but...so far, we're okay; right?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{well, uh, i mean, i'm just...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i will take that as a 'yes'.}
<A>__{harry takes off his coat and scarf, hangs them on a hook.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you want a glass of wine or something?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i was just gonna give you a kiss hello.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{oh, okay.}
<A>__{neither is sure where to go. cheek? lips? he lands on her chin. .not what he wanted, but he takes a seat across from her. she looks at him utterly speechless.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i remember you said if we still know each other we should go to paris for our birthdays, well, we still know each other..".}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{that's true, but, harry, i haven't heard from you in six months.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i know but i've certainly been thinking about you. there's a lot i have to say. first thing is... i'm not mad at you anymore.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{good, 'cause i'm not mad at you anymore either.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's a relief...since i did come all the way to france and everything. and... happy birthday.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(afraid of everything he could possibly say)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and congratulations on your amazing success...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{it's been quite a ride. funny, i thought maybe i'd hear from you when it opened. where've you been?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{after i saw you in the theater that afternoon, i had another "episode...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i was actually okay, but i was sure i was dying and the doctor in the er said i needed to decompress. so i did. i walked out of there and changed my life, sold most of my businesses, packed my bags and moved to an island in the caribbean.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{that's where you've been all this time? in the caribbean?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{actually...no.}
