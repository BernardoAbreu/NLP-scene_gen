<L>__{exterior tverskoy house, st. petersburg night}
<A>__{the karenin coach arrives. it's anna arriving at betsy's. she enters the house in almost unseemly haste. several coaches are waiting.}
<L>__{interior cab, st. petersburg, same time night}
<A>__{vronsky, in a state, lets himself be carried along. then he changes his mind. he puts his head out of the window to shout to the coachman.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{turn round!}
<L>__{interior betsy's reception rooms, tverskoy}
<D>__{house night}
<A>__{anna enters. faces turn to her. she glances around. she knows at once that vronsky isn't there. betsy beckons to her across the room. anna, self possessed, smiling, nodding to friends, pressing a hand held out to her, offering the other hand to be kissed, glides through a crowd of betsy's guests.}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{wasn't nilsson glorious? one sees that she has studied kaulbach, of course . . . there's something louis quinze about tuskevich . . . as if he came with the furniture . . .}
<A>__{betsy is smoking elegantly. she kisses anna.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{he's gone. but you're just in time for the surprise.}
<A>__{there is a series of minor explosions outside and the darkness out there turns into an illuminated garden lit by fountains of fire, sprays of light. the guests react with cries of pleasure and applause. anna turns at once to the window near her, puts her face up against the glass, putting her hands to her temples as if to see the illuminations better.}
<B>__{reverse}
<A>__{her self possessed face, lit by fireworks, falls apart in misery. the firework display continues for a short minute and is applauded. betsy acknowledges the congratulations and sycophancy which are her due. foot men come through the room with trays of ices. anna is still at the window, unaware that there is only darkness outside. in the room, betsy notes the oddity: anna alone with her back to the room.}
<B>__{reverse on anna}
<A>__{anna opens her eyes. she is lost for a moment, perplexed.}
<P>__{vronsky (o.c.)}
<D>__{may i have the honour of bringing you an ice?}
<A>__{anna turns, understanding nothing.}
<C>__{vronsky }
<D>__{ices are being served.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i would prefer to try a cigarette.}
<A>__{she sits down. vronsky takes out a cigarette case. he lights her cigarette. she tries it and coughs.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<P>__{(in french)}
<D>__{courage!}
<A>__{anna smiles. puffs delicately once.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{she gives the cigarette to him.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{i will try another one sometime.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{when?}
<A>__{she looks at him in surprise. he dunks the cigarette in an abandoned dish of ice cream.}
<C>__{vronsky }
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{just as i was thinking your manners have improved since moscow. you behaved badly, very badly.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{and who was responsible for that?}
<A>__{anna gets up and walks over to betsy's chair.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{give me a cup of tea.}
<A>__{betsy obediently gets up to fill a cup from the samovar. vronsky follows anna. this is watched by more than one guest. betsy hands the cup to anna.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{how nice alexei aleksandrevich has arrived.}
<A>__{karenin enters smiling. lisa merkalova and anna's friend share a delicious malicious moment.}
<C>__{lisa merkalova}
<D>__{i'm not sure my nerves can stand another alexei at this moment.}
<A>__{as betsy and karenin move smilingly to greet each other, karenin's radar picks up the two women's intimate laughter. karenin remains at apparent ease, as though unaware of people's glances at vronsky and anna, and he kisses betsy's hand. princess myagkaya has meanwhile gone over to anna. anna likes her and is glad of the diversion.}
<C>__{princess myagkaya}
<D>__{so the schuzburgs asked us to dinner. the sauce was said to have cost a thousand rou bles, and it was ghastly. we had to ask them back. i gave them a sauce that cost eighty five kopeks and it was a triumph.}
<A>__{anna and vronsky laugh. princess myagkaya moves on.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{were you glad to see me or not?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{this must stop. you make me feel as if i were guilty of something.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i want you to go to moscow and beg kitty to forgive you.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{no, that's not what you want. moscow? i can do better than that. tonight i refused a posting to tashkent. i can change my mind, and you'll never see me again.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{if you have any thought for me, you will give me back my peace.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{i have no peace to give. there can be no peace for us only misery or the greatest happiness. you are my whole life now.}
<A>__{she looks at him and nods slowly, as if in thought. betsy diplomatically leads karenin to anna.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{your husband is impossible! his opinions are all wrong but he talks so brilliantly he wins every argument.}
<A>__{anna looks up at her, hearing nothing.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{she notices karenin, who kisses her hand. vronsky acknowledges karenin.}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{i called to take you home.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, i'm staying. send the carriage back for me.}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{he bows to betsy. ignoring vronsky, he turns away.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{vronsky is with one group of guests, anna with another. she is animated, excited, at a small table, involved in a game of cards which she wins, to local applause. she speaks a "must go" to betsy, and swiftly goes to the door.}
