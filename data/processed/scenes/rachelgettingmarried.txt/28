<L>__{exterior ukrainian folk museum. night.}
<A>__{guests leaving.}
<L>__{interior buchman house. night.}
<A>__{kym drops into a chair in the dining room as paul, carol, rachel, sidney, kieran, and emma struggle in with several elaborately wrapped wedding gifts and leftovers from the rehearsal dinner, which they pile on the dining room table. rachel and sidney are having a quiet, tense exchange.}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(to anyone, examining her split ends)}
<D>__{i'm exhausted. is there any watermelon?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{let me see.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(to kym, as if she's joking)}
<D>__{nice apology.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(again, making a joke out of it)}
<D>__{nice apology.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{i was toasting you and i was making amends. it's one of the steps. it's important.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i know what the steps are.}
<A>__{rachel glides to the den and drags out the huge dictionary.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i learned them in school, and i've visited you in various facilities, kym.}
<A>__{sidney and emma share a look. rachel drops the dictionary on the dining room table.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{oh, god. dad?}
<A>__{kym looks to her father. carol returns with a tray and a huge watermelon that's been impaled with an enormous kitchen knife.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{amends. noun. often followed by 'for'. offset a disability or frustration by development in another direction.}
<A>__{rachel blinks at her sister.}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(exaggerated)}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you've never said anything to me, that's remotely apologetic. yet, all of a sudden, at my wedding dinner, in front of everybody, you decide to grace us all with your development?}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{christ. i just got here.}
<A>__{carol hands kym a slice of watermelon.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{here. anybody else?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{"hey everybody! and guests! just in case you might be thinking about something else for five minutes, like, i don't know, my sister's wedding they just cut me loose!}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{i'm a loose cannon, is that hysterical? anyone for some rehab humor? because i'm really fine with acknowledging my disease. and now watch me be really selfless, and weave a lovely blanket apology to my sister for being a tad out of her loop."}
<A>__{rachel giggles. sidney and kieran, staying out of this, exchange a glance.}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(chewing)}
<D>__{you're so cynical. dad, since when has she been this cynical?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{she's making an effort, rachel.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{an effort. that's what it was? because i think she presumes that since everything has always revolved around her disease, everything else is going to revolve around her recovery. that's what i think.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{rachel. she just got home.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{again.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{i had no idea you were so angry, doctor.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm not.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{kymmie, your sister's got a lot on her plate. she's uptight about...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm not uptight, dad.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{she's meeting sidney's folks for the first time, there's menus, there's all that live music, you're home, there's a thousand things to worry about.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{absolutely, a wedding will take it right out of you, boy.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah, it would be so lovely if we could all just...}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(removing seeds)}
<D>__{you people need to purge. you people really should go to nar anon or something. i mean it.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{oh my lord. kym, we have gone through nar anon, baby. you know that.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(turning her head)}
<D>__{you people? you mean the people in this room? your family?}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{all of you people living in this little world of judgement and paranoia and mistrust. i can feel it every second. at the slightest sign of ingratitude or absence of atonement it's like the freaking salem witch trials around here. i might as well be...}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(pouncing)}
<D>__{don't even start...}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(standing next to her husband)}
<D>__{nobody can make you feel any way unless you let them, kym.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{thank you carol, for your inevitable pearl of wisdom, but you people are my family. you people make me feel like shit a hundred times a day. you try living under dad's constant monitoring for five minutes and see how you like it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what constant monitoring?}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{"i will drive you!" "carol, she's back!" "don't sleep here, sleep there." "here. eat this." dad, you're obsessed.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{please. that's hardly news. you may not know this...sure you do...the only way to engage dad in any meaningful communication is to start the conversation with your name. "have you heard from kym? how's kym?" it resuscitates him. it jars him into the moment. like an alarm.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's unfair, rachel. and completely untrue.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and she's even worse! "dad, you're never going to believe this, but i lost the car again." "dad, you're never going to believe this, but that check you sent me never showed up and my landlord hates me." "dad, can somebody meet me downstairs with cab fare and you're never going to believe this but i need to go to the emergency room and my neighbor's suing me and my checkbook got stolen!"}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{gee, rach, sounds like you have some paternal sibling issues to work through.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{are you kidding? the two of you are like a double helix of crises. in the language of psychology one could say you both suffer from acute boundary issues.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{rachel! it's nice that you're getting your ph.d }
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(she throws up her hands.)}
<D>__{ oh god }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{ but don't be patronizing. it's ugly. it doesn't become you.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{how come she gets to spout off about paternal issues, but god forbid i should even reference the "boundary thing," even though i actually know what i'm talking about?}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(waving her arms)}
<D>__{hello? by the way? i'm not in crisis. i haven't been in crisis for a year.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you just got out of rehab!}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{why is this so difficult for you people to understand? it's like you're not happy unless i'm in some kind of desperate situation. you have no idea what to do with me unless i'm desperate. god. why am i the only one who's willing to say this stuff?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{oh, poor you. you're so much more evolved in your suffering. you know what? your suffering is not the most important thing in the world to everybody!}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{there are billions and billions and billions of people, in nations all over the world, who never even think about you! other people have lives! we have lives! i have a life! i'm in school. i'm getting married. i'm...}
<A>__{rachel just stands there, not saying anything.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what?!!}
<A>__{dead silence. everyone stares at rachel. rachel looks at sidney. sidney passes the look right back to her.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm pregnant.}
<A>__{beat, then: huge whoops and hollers!!!!}
<C>__{everybody}
<D>__{congratulations! oh my god! etc!!!}
<A>__{paul hugs rachel and kisses her hair. sidney and kieran hug. emma hugs rachel and kisses sidney. hugging all around. kym is pissed. paul grabs kym and rachel, and hugs both daughters at once. rachel and kym's faces are mushed right next to each other. kym is impatient and stiff in the dreaded double mush. kym breaks from paul's vice like grip.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{that is so unfair!}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(ecstatic)}
<D>__{when did you find out?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{roughly about the day before we decided to get married.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i can barely believe it myself!}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(laughing, mushing rachel's belly)}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{how long? how much pregnant? did you tell your mother?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{we told her at dinner.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{she was so happy }
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{wait! stop! you can't just drop that tectonic bit of information into a completely separate conversation, rachel. you can't do that!}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{kym, you're going to have a niece!}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{or a nephew!}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{oh, god. of course i'm happy for you. but you can't tell me when we're talking like this. it's a total set up!}
<A>__{beat. all the energy drains out of rachel.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i am so fucking exhausted.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{dad, will you tell her i'm happy for her?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i just...i need to go to bed. sidney?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{yeah, okay. great idea. i'm beat too.}
<C>__{kym}
<P>__{(to rachel)}
<D>__{you're leaving? in the middle of this conversation?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{kymmie, she's pregnant. she's exhausted.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{of course. fair enough. i'm off to raid the medicine cabinet.}
<A>__{kym is gone.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{she's not serious?}
<A>__{everyone gathers around rachel.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{oh, rachel darling, and sidney, i couldn't be happier.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{she wasn't serious, was she?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{do either of you want anything? a sandwich? you must be hungry. there's cold saagwala and a little aloo gobi left over?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{no thanks, dad. i really am pretty sleepy.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you're pretty everything!}
<A>__{he mushes her face and kisses her cheek. then he mushes carol's face.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{holy cow. what a day. i think i've aged. i mean it.}
<P>__{(to paul) )}
<D>__{would you mind if i went to bed, darling?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(kissing her again)}
<D>__{of course not. i will be up, carol. i'm just going to load the dishwasher.}
<A>__{sidney intones the opening bars to paul's heroic "dishwasher theme". paul raises the cautionary finger in sidney's direction. sidney stops with the music.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{let me help, it'll be quicker.}
<A>__{now the cautionary finger is levelled at carol.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{don't mess with the king.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{okay,okay.}
<A>__{hands in the air, carol leaves the room.}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{wow. that's it for me too, you guys. good night everybody.}
<A>__{kieran lays a manly, buddy hug on sidney.}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{congratulations, man.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{thanks, my friend.}
<A>__{kieran leaves. now it's just rachel, paul and sidney. paul is beaming like a klieg light.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i've never been so tired in my life.}
<A>__{paul gives rachel a kiss on the cheek and mushes her face some more.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{dad?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes, sweetheart?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i hope it's okay, i told mom at dinner. about the baby.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{of course, lamb chop. i'm so happy! i'm going to be a grandpa!}
<A>__{sidney mushes paul and they attempt a hug and laugh and then they really hug.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i wish ethan were here.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i know, sweetheart. me too.}
<C>__{kieran's voice off}
<D>__{that went well.}
