<L>__{interior deckard's apartment bedroom day}
<A>__{rachael is lying across the bed in one of deckard's shirts, her chin over the edge, her eyes moving around the room. deckard lies next to her. looking like a man who died a voluptuous death.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{when was the last time you cleaned this place?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{hmmm?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{have you ever cleaned your apartment?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{don't be fooled by appearances.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{it appears to be dirty why don't you get somebody?}
<A>__{he rolls over to admire her legs.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{because they would ruin the arrangement.}
<A>__{he kisses the back of her thigh.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{they could clean around the arrangement.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i don't like people snooping around my stuff.}
<A>__{he kisses her other thigh, gets up and goes into the bathroom.}
<C>__{deckard's voice}
<D>__{there's a vacuum in the front room closet is you wanna give it a try.}
<A>__{rachael lies there a moment, then gets up and goes into the front room and opens the closet door. the vacuum is not easy to get to, but finally she wrestles it out. as she starts to plug it in }
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{oh no, don't do that.}
<A>__{he's wrapped in a sheet, watching her from the doorway.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{but if i don't plug it in how can i...}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{never mind the plug, just go through the motions.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{but then how can you...}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i don't like the noise. just practice. practice makes perfect.}
<A>__{she stares at him like he's nuts.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i'm serious. go ahead. show me how you would do it.}
<A>__{reluctantly she makes some half hearted passes with the thing.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{how about under the couch there. come on.}
<A>__{she bends over to get it. deckard pulls up a chair and sits down with his chin in his hands. she looks back at him.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{this feels stupid.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{good for a smart girl to feel stupid. part of your education.}
<A>__{she drops the vacuum and sits on the floor. deckard gets up and comes towards her. her eyes travel halfway down his sheet and she leaves.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{you're sick, deckard.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i never felt better.}
