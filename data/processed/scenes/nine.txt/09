<L>__{exterior hotel excelsior, via veneto day}
<A>__{the convoy comes to a quick stop in front of the hotel excelsior on the via veneto. as soon as guido gets out of the car, the waiting paparazzi snap his picture. beautiful women look at him. guido moves quickly by them. dante and the team hurry after him. fausto tackles dante. and they hurry after guido.}
<L>__{interior presidential suite day}
<A>__{a big suite. about fifty reporters, men and women, are in the room, and an array of microphones are on a coffee table next to a long couch. excited chaos. a radio reporter narrates in the background.}
<C>__{radio reporter}
<D>__{and we're just waiting for the arrival of contini...any moment now could this film put the maestro back on top?}
<A>__{a few news cameras are filming. there's a buffet, and a bartender. and guido comes into the room, shaking hands, patting shoulders, grabbing a glass of champagne. dante and the team follow him in.}
<C>__{radio reporter }
<D>__{and here he is..!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{silenzio, per favore...thank you, thank you...}
<C>__{radio reporter}
<D>__{dante, guido contini's long time producer, is about to speak...}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i want to say a few words from my heart. i am humbled and thrilled to be able to announce that i am producing guido contini's next film, italia, which will star once again contini's longtime inspiration, the international film star, claudia jenssen...}
<A>__{a stunning film poster is revealed claudia jenssen emerging from the colosseum: claudia jenssen. un film di guido contini. italia. flashes. excitement.}
<C>__{dante }
<D>__{...we start shooting in ten days time in cinecitta. that makes it one week from monday.}
<P>__{(to guido, handing over)}
<D>__{thank you, maestro, thank you very much. this is our ninth film together. guido contini.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{thanks for coming, everybody.}
<A>__{pretending to leave, he heads towards the exit and kisses dante on the cheek. he returns to the couch. all the reporters fire their questions at once. the questions come on top of each other, and guido covers his despair with an inflated energy. he takes his sunglasses off and signals to dinardo, a harsh looking woman.}
<C>__{dinardo}
<D>__{maestro contini. maestro contini.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dinardo}
<D>__{grazie. maestro contini, your new film is called italia... big title.}
<A>__{another journalist, leopardi, vile sitting next to her, egging dinardo on almost sniggers with contempt.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{actually, it's my shortest title yet.}
<C>__{dinardo}
<D>__{but hardly a modest one.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{films are not modest. they cost too much, they take too long, and they involve too many people. so they should have grand titles.}
<C>__{dinardo}
<D>__{and might you tell the press what the film is about?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{why? i still don't know what my last film was about.}
<C>__{leopardi}
<P>__{(in a loud aside to dinardo)}
<D>__{that was the problem. nobody else did.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{of course i can tell you what my film is about...i can tell you the story, i can tell you who i am going to cast, the music i want to use, i can tell you everything... but... i... won't. i'm afraid that if i say anything, the word might get out to the press.}
<A>__{general laughter in the room. he wins a round, but is clearly feeling the strain... dante recognizes, steps in.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{our next film will be exactly as it sounds. italia. it's the very spirit of italy italy as myth, italy as a woman, italy as a dream.}
<C>__{leopardi}
<D>__{is this true?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{it sounds fantastic. i can't wait to see it.}
<A>__{he's still winning. ignoring the question, he points to stephanie, a gorgeous fashion reporter he recognizes from american vogue. flirtatious and charming, she wants him and he senses it.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{signor contini.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{stephanie.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{grazie. could you tell the fashionable women of america who your favorite designer is this year?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{i'm less interested in the wrapping than what might be inside it.}
<C>__{reporter one}
<D>__{signor contini! you're a man of the world, yes? educated in britain, a home in biarritz. with italia is it fair to say that you've come home for good?}
<C>__{reporter two }
<P>__{(tries to interrupt)}
<D>__{what do you think of the new wave in the french cinema?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{for good?}
<C>__{reporter four}
<D>__{it's been a long time since you made a movie with your wife, do you plan on casting her in this new film?}
<A>__{guido is spinning plates.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{i told luisa that when we got married i would never again make love to my leading lady.}
<C>__{reporter four}
<D>__{but she hasn't worked at all since working with you.}
<A>__{laughter. everyone starts firing questions at guido again. another reporter asks a question.}
<C>__{reporter five}
<D>__{but why are you being so tight lipped about this film? it's a serious question. what's the big deal?}
