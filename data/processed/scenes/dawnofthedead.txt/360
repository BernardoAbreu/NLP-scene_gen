<A>__{now the zombie is between her and the pyramid, cutting off her immediate route. it is very near. fran backs away a few steps as she tries to strike the flare head on the small striker on the cylinder cap. it doesn't fire... she tries again... and again. now, the zombie has reached the knap sack. it kicks through the items and knocks and rolls the other flares. fran's flare finally catches with a great whoosh, the bright flame startling the woman as well as the zombie. the creature's eyes go wide and it brings its arms up to avoid the brightness. the intense white flame casts an eerie light over the creature and throws the zombie's enormous shadow against the cartons and wall. the creature backs away a few steps almost tripping over the articles on the floor. fran manages to advance close enough to snatch two extra cylinders and skirt around the zombie in a wide arc. the creature swats the air, keeping distance, but threatening. fran considers the firestair door, but decides on the pyramid. she circles around to a point where she can climb up from behind the moaning zombie. she rushes for the cartons and climbs, but loses her footing while trying to hold the flares and crashes into the topmost carton. it starts to slide off the pyramid and tumbles to the floor almost crashing into the zombie. the creature starts to clutch at the pyramid. the stack of cartons is now too short and fran can reach the skylight but can't pull herself up. she accidentally drops two flares, including the lit one. it tumbles to the floor behind the pyramid where it no longer offends the zombie's eye's. now the creature tries to climb to the woman. fran grabs the last flare in her mouth and reaches with both hands for the skylight. she lifts with all her might and her feet come off the cartons but she cannot pull herself up. as she tries to lower her feet back to the cartons, the pyramid shakes and wobbles from the zombie. the creature is making progress; its hands can almost touch fran's foot.}
