<L>__{interior miranda's cell night}
<A>__{miranda's pale skin is visible in the dim monochromatic light. we are moving towards her, seeing her as if from the pov of someone approaching her. we become aware of the ragged breathing sound. miranda opens her eyes, looks this way and that, then closes them again. she is nearly asleep when she hears a sound we've heard before. the strained wet sound. miranda's eyes snap open. she slowly sits up, back against the wall. squinting to cover every inch of the room. and now she sees it: a shadow crouched in the corner. roughly the size of a person. miranda climbs off the bed and slowly walks towards it. scared, but determined. she wrinkles her nose at the putrid smell coming from it. she gets closer... closer... the ragged breathing growing louder as she reaches the shadow she stretches out her hand and finally touches... nothing. she swipes her hand through the air, feeling stupid.}

<D>__{this is not going to work. i'm sick of being watched, and i know this place well and it doesn't smell this bad.}
<A>__{she paces around the room, feels the wall, taps her head.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i'm awake, i'm not dreaming. i'm alive this is not some afterlife mumbo jumbo. so called paranormal activity can be debunked a million different ways. so whatever you are, whatever it is i'm making up here i'm letting you go, i'm setting you free. i'm the wrong person. and i need to sleep. i'm not afraid and i don't believe and i'm fully aware that this is all in my mind fiction a concocted alternate reality and i acknowledge it. and now i'm done with it. i'm going to sleep now.}
<A>__{the moment is as brave as it is ridiculous. she has psyched herself into verbally defeating the ghost. and now she climbs back in bed.}
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(sleepy)}
<D>__{besides, if you really were the ghost of rachel parsons, you would let me out of this cell.}
<A>__{a beat. and now we hear the sound of the deadbolt slide open. the door opens quietly. push into miranda's face. properly scared now.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<A>__{if proof is what she wanted, proof is what she got. from now on we'll refer to the teenage girl as rachel.}
