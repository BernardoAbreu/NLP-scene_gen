<A>__{l'avventura (the adventure) script by michelangelo antonioni elio bartolini tonino guerra translated by louis brigante it is the afternoon of a summer's day. anna, a twenty five year old brunette, comes out from the entrance of a stately building and walks along a pathway that leads up to a dirt road. she is in a great hurry and becomes a little annoyed and surprised at seeing her father, a meticulously dressed and elderly gentleman, standing near the curb busily talking to his chauffeur in front of a black british car.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{so, there you are... i've been upstairs looking all over for you...}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence during which anna's father deliberately ignores her presence. she stares at him intently, trying to determine his mood and wondering how she is going to tell him what she has to say before she leaves. finally, he turns around and faces her.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{oh, i thought you were already on the high seas.}
<A>__{anna is barely able to control her temper, but realizing that the discussion is about to take the usual sarcastic turn, she immediately checks herself.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, not yet, dad.}
<A>__{her father fixes her with a long ironic look. conscious of his daughter's haste, he is apparently trying his best to detain her.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, dad, it isn't.}
<A>__{there is another moment of silence. meanwhile, a car has pulled up on the other side of the road. it is claudia, a twenty four year old blonde and a friend of anna's. both she and the driver get out of the car and remain discreetly in the background, waiting for the conversation to end. anna's father resumes speaking, after a cursory nod to claudia who, in turn, responds with a polite but half hearted smile.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{and how long will you be away?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{four or five days.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(resignedly)}
<D>__{oh, very well. i will just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. i should be used to it by now.}
<A>__{anna glares at him furiously but still manages to restrain herself.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{used to what?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{to the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(protestingly and with a deep sense of compassion)}
<D>__{but how could you say such a thing?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{because it's true. after thirty years not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, i should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{and have you any other truths to tell me?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{you already know what they are.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you mean sandro, don't you? well, i beg of you, please, spare me that. goodbye, dad.}
<A>__{she kisses him on the cheek but the father remains unmoved. it is obvious that he still has something else he wants to say to her. in fact, after gazing upon his daughter with a certain amount of pity, he finally does say it.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{that type will never marry you, my child.}
<A>__{anna has a difficult time restraining herself but manages somehow to keep calm as she answers.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{up until now, dad, i've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{it's the same thing. goodbye, dear.}
<A>__{he now returns the kiss his daughter had given him a short while ago. then, without once turning around, he heads slowly towards the entrance of the house, as claudia comes into the foreground. anna, still very tense and upset over the scene with her father, gets into the car. claudia follows after her, as the driver puts her suitcase into the trunk.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{have you been waiting long? you'll have to excuse me.}
<A>__{anna doesn't answer. she merely pats claudia's hand. the car takes off, as anna's maid, standing to one side of the road, waves a warm goodbye. claudia responds by waving back, but anna doesn't even look around. instead, she turns to the driver and says:}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{please hurry, alvaro. we're late.}
<A>__{the car speeds ahead along the dusty road, across a verdant strip of land, until it reaches the archway of a stone wall fence around which it turns and disappears. it is seen again emerging from behind a cement wall and continues racing swiftly onward over a road that runs between two high walls. there is no sign of traffic. only silence. it is an ancient road, and a very elegant one. claudia looks at it admiringly. anna continues to remain wrapped up within herself. the car now makes another turn, heading into a small, narrow road flanked on each side by gardens of patrician villas. suddenly, it emerges on a drab, modern street amid the kind of traffic typical of any modern town. finally the car enters the street where sandro lives and pulls up in front of a small but very fashionable palazzo. anna and claudia get out. and as the driver starts to remove the suitcases from the trunk, claudia turns to anna and says:}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i will wait for you here.}
<A>__{anna starts to walk across the street and is about to enter a building. surprised, claudia calls out to her:}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{but where are you going?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm thirsty.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{if i had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom i hadn't seen for a month ...}
<A>__{all of a sudden, anna stops. she is pensive, almost sullen.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you know, i could just as well go without seeing him today.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{what! after giving us such a run around...}
<A>__{claudia stops, smiles, and jokingly tries to laugh it off.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i see... so it's farewell to the yacht...and farewell to the cruise...}
<A>__{anna pays no heed to claudia's teasing comments but follows her own original line of thought.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you know, it's terrible to be far away from one another. really, it's difficult to keep an affair going when one is here and the other is somewhere else. but, at the same time...it's comforting. because it gives you a chance to consider what you want and how you want it... but when he's right there before you all the time... well, he's right there...}
<P>__{(then, with a sense of exasperation)}
<D>__{oh, let's go back....}
<A>__{claudia notices sandro leaning out of the window from his apartment on the first floor of the building. he is looking at them attentively. he is a young man of thirty five. his shirt is unbuttoned and the tie around his neck is unknotted. realizing that he has been spotted, he smiles and waves a cheerful hello.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i will be right down.}
<A>__{as if seized by a sudden powerful impulse, anna heads straight towards the of the building. claudia looks at her with astonishment, and watches her disappear into the doorway. then she looks up again at the window. but sandro is no longer there.}
