<L>__{interior classroom. day}
<A>__{jenny, hattie and tina are sitting on their desks, waiting for the start of a lesson. nine or ten classmates are scattered around the room, talking distractedly, but jenny's group is much more animated: tina and hattie are leaning forward, listening to jenny, their eyes bright. they are clearly awestruck by jenny's tales of the outside world.}
<C>__{tina}
<P>__{(to hattie)}
<D>__{i'm not interested in schubert. i want to know what else was on the programme.}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{there was nothing like that. he was the perfect gentleman. he just said he wanted to take me places and show me things.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{things plural? oh my gawd!}
<A>__{more laughter. the english teacher, miss stubbs, young and fresh faced and lively looking, enters, and picks up on the excitement of jenny's coterie.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{i knew that in the end `jane eyre' would work its magic upon you. i'm presuming that's what you're so animated about.}
<A>__{the students start to sit down at desks in a more conventional arrangement.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{`jane eyre' and jenny's new boyfriend.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{he's not my "new boyfriend". god.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{it's true. he's more a man friend, isn't he? he's got a sports car, miss stubbs.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{ah. a mr rochester figure.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{i think he must be as blind as mr rochester.}
<A>__{laughter. jenny pulls a face at her.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{is there no end to your thirst for literary understanding, jenny? as you may have noticed, i'm attempting to turn the subject away from jenny's lurid love life and towards the matter in hand.}
<A>__{she starts to hand out essays.}
<C>__{miss stubbs}
<D>__{and it's quite clear on this evidence that most of you know much too much about the former, and almost nothing about the latter. reluctantly i must concede that jenny is evidently an expert on both matters. excellent as always, jenny.}
<A>__{miss stubbs slaps an essay down on jenny's desk. we can see that it's marked `a+'.}
