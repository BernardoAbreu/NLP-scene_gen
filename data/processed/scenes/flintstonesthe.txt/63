<L>__{exterior flintstone house day}
<A>__{three big dino mounted trucks are parked in front. you have to read the words on all three: "rockstyles of..." "the rich..." "and famous." technicians roll out gear, set up big spotlights, etc. closer yard rockin' leach is surveying the place with an aide. fred and wilma are with them. leach makes a "frame" with his hands, "pans" the area.}
<C>__{leach}
<D>__{hmm. lovely little guest 'ouse, mister flintstone. so simple, so ordinary, so unexceptional... why, h'it's almost quainterior let's say we start with the camera 'ere, except...}
<A>__{leach breaks off, looks over the fence at the rubble homestead. he shakes his head sadly.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{w what's wrong?}
<C>__{leach}
<D>__{well, just look at that yard over there... barbecues and trikes, not exactly the right image...}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{maybe you could move those plants to block them out...?}
<C>__{leach}
<D>__{good idea. rodney, get 'hoppin' with those greens.}
<A>__{the aide nods, gathers some workers. they start moving the potted plants. puzzled, wilma comes over.}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{fred, this was supposed to be a 'typical evening' at the flintstones, and you invited fifty people i don't even know. now what's going on? where are they taking my ficus sauruses?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{it's the rubble yard, wilma. it's just not the right image...}
<A>__{he starts away, suddenly notices his own barbecue and trikes... quickly, without missing a stride, he tosses a tarp over them, slides a potted plant over for good measure. barney and betty's house same time betty, hair and face done, but still in a slip, is putting a reluctant bam bam into a cute little blazer. in the f.g., barney finishes tying a black tie, then struggles into a dinner jacket.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i don't know why you want to go to this thing... after the way fred's been treating you lately }
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{fred's in a high powered executive job, betty. there's a lot of pressure on him.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{yeah... and it's all around his belt. if it wasn't for poor wilma i wouldn't give him the geological time }
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{trust me, betty. after the fibrerock debut, he'll be the same old fred.}
<A>__{both react to the sound of hammering and sawing. curious, they go out the sliding bedroom door into the yard and see their pov the fence the television crew has just finished nailing boards up over the top of the fence. now the big potted plants are dropped into place. with each hammer stroke or thud a little more of the late afternoon sun is shut off until barney and betty are in shadow. finally a canvas tarp is tossed as gracefully as pizza dough, sails into the rubble yard and covers their bird bath. one last stray end lands on barney's head.}
