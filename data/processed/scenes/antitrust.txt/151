<L>__{exterior city park night}
<A>__{they're in a bandshell. the rain falls heavily, drips off the eaves. she holds the filament from teddy's workspace.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{it's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. they upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. they'd be happy just to steal code forever. but when a program gets close to fruition. like teddy. he was almost there.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{but why would they ?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{you know. there is no second place. and what's the risk? the killings're undetectable, they're hand tailored, they make "sense." i mean, they're in the information business. they have scenarios for all of us, too. in case we find out too much.}
<A>__{she's peering at him. he reads her mind.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i'm not one of them. not trying to "suss you out."}
<A>__{she wants to believe him.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{they killed my best friend! i'm living with somebody they pay to go to bed with me. can't you trust somebody just once? i don't wanna be alone here.}
<A>__{his plea is so ardent, his humanity so transparent. but she can't quite do it.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i'm sorry, milo... i'm sorry.}
<A>__{she smiles sadly as she backs away.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(forcefully)}
<D>__{i know why you're so secretive. why you won't let anybody near you.}
<P>__{(quieter)}
<D>__{i know what he did to you.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<A>__{she tries to sound tough; there are tears in her eyes.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{so that's in my file?}
<A>__{he wants to comfort her. he takes a step toward her. she shakes her head: no.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{is that my scenario?}
<P>__{(when he hesitates)}
<D>__{tell me.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{they'd frame him.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{he's out of prison?}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(he nods)}
<D>__{they're already watching you. if they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. he'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."}
<A>__{she draws her hands to her face as the facade cracks. she weeps silently. he moves to her, carefully, slowly, seeing her fear, her trauma. he touches her shoulders. she tenses, tries to back away.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{but he holds on.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{nobody's gonna hurt you.}
<A>__{slowly, he wraps his arms around her. she remains tense for a moment, then yields, pressing her face into his shoulder. the rain drums on the bandshell. after a moment:}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{...milo?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i always felt if a boy i liked ever found out he'd run. he'd think i was unclean.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{no, no. never.}
<A>__{she clings to him tightly, now, the wall of her mistrust breached after all the years of pain, secrecy, shame. a wide shot: they hold each other, alone in the storm.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{all his suspicions were allayed?}
