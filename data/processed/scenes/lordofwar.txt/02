<A>__{ the bullet's crate rattles around in an open bed truck along an industrial road, passes a decapitated statue of lenin. the crate containing our bullet is placed on a ship in the cold grey odessa harbor. a container door closes, plunging the bullet into darkness. the door re opens. the bullet, still in its crate, now basks in bright, tropical sunshine, surrounded by an azure sea. the crate is removed by a pair of slim, dark hands, revealing a glimpse of the bustling, weathered port of abidjan in the ivory coast. the crate is one of dozens unloaded from the ship. bullet's pov from another open air truck, now slogging through a mud clogged road in lush rainforest. the bullet is unloaded from the truck in freetown, sierra leone immediately grabbed by the young hand of a ruf soldier. the bullet is loaded into a 30 round magazine which is inserted into an ak 47 machine gun. the bullet waits in the gloomy chamber. suddenly, from outside, the sound of raised voices and gunfire. the bullet and its neighbors start to rise quickly up the magazine towards the chamber as the kalashnikov is fired. our hero bullet is nexterior will it see action? smack. the gun's bolt strieks the explosive cap, gunpowder ignited, the bullet driven out of the barrel. shed of its casing now only a slug the bullet emerges into bright sunshine. it is flying down the main street in freetown. the bullet gives us a perfect point of view of the bullet ahead of it. they are both flying towards their intended target a wild eyed child soldier, a boy no more than twelve, firing an ak 47 almost as tall as he is. the leading bullet narrowly misses, whistles past the boy's ear, striking the whitewashed wall behind one more pock mark in a building riddled with pock marks. our bullet, following close behind, finds its mark, slamming into the boy's forehead just above his left eye his expression, oddly relieved. the bullet carves through the lobes of the boy's brain where it is enveloped in blood, finally plunged into darkness the bullet's final resting place.}
