<A>__{hunsecker has come forward. but now, as he listens to the gramaphone record playing in the bedroom, hunsecker relaxes, assuming that this is a sign that sidney's suspicions are unfounded.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(coming forward)}
<D>__{what a cornball you are, sidney...}
<A>__{camera tracks to include sidney. he does not share hunsecker's confidence; he knocks again, calling:}

<P>__{(anxiously)}
<D>__{susie!}
<P>__{(in growing fear)}
<D>__{susie!}
<A>__{camera tracks closer to sidney. as he tries the doorknob, camera tilts down. sidney's hand tries the doorknob, finds it locked, shakes it forcefully.}

<A>__{a detail shot. sidney's hand is still shaking the doorknob. he releases it. camera pulls back to a two shot of sidney and hunsecker as sidney retreats from the door in apprehension. now hunsecker has begun to share sidney's anxiety. he moves to the door, knocks and then pounds on it.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(with authority)}
<D>__{susie, this is j.j.! open up!}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{a close up. she comes forward past the blowing curtains. the wind whips at her hair. over scene we hear the rumble of the traffic on broadway far below.}
<B>__{resume hunsecker}
<A>__{he is pounding on the door again. camera makes a quick pan to sidney who, in a split second, realizes that susan may have gone out on the balcony. he turns, dashes towards the study to look out on the terrace.}
<B>__{resume susan}
<A>__{she has now started to climb onto the parapet. sidney leaps into shot, dragging her bodily off the parapet and out of shot. we hear susan cry out, a hysterical gasp. camera, looking through the windows of susan's bedroom, sees the door fly open as hunsecker bursts into the room. he looks swiftly around, advances towards the open window. exasperated by the sound of the gramaphone, he switches it off; he steps out onto the terrace. camera pans with him as he turns to look back into the study where susan's inanimate figure is sprawled on the floor, half across the low upholstered footstool. sidney, white and shaking, is standing over her.}

<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{hunsecker stoops into shot. tenderly, he lifts the girl's body to get it into the arm chair. susan is quite lifeless, limp with the dead weight of a creature that has lost any instinct for self preservation. but as she feels her brother's arms, and as she recognizes who it is, she breaks out in hysteria.}

<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(her body shaking)}
<D>__{go away!...go away!...}
<A>__{hunsecker would like to comfort her, but he dare not touch her again for fear of inviting another rebuff. he is deeply hurt and wounded. embarrassed that sidney should watch this moment, hunsecker rises. to cover his emotion, he walks to the tray of drinks in background; he pours a brandy and comes back. stooping, he offers it to susan. her only reaction is again to wrench herself away from him, facing the opposite direction.}

<P>__{(sobbing bitterly)}

<D>__{yes...yes...yes...}

<A>__{camera follows hunsecker. it now takes in sidney who is standing beside him. sidney has begun to stare fixedly at hunsecker.

<A>__{during the latter part of the speech, susan rises slowly to her feet, staring first at sidney and then, with fearful significance, at her brother. hunsecker does not look at her; he is concentrated on sidney. twice he has been about to demolish sidney, but he now stops, a thought in his head.}
<B>__{hunsecker}
<A>__{he is perfectly controlled, smiling.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{like most italians, sidney's got a big gift for dramatics. i, however, prefer the cool and stubborn facts. sidney has not appeared in my column in weeks check that fact with mary. that leads right to another fact: sidney had nothing to lose tonight! to the contrary, dear only his obvious greed to beat his way back into the column explains his accusations against me! in brief, blackmail!}
