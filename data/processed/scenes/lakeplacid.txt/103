<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior sea chopper continuous}
<A>__{gare still scans the water's surface, looking for any sign of hector. and her face freezes. oh yes, there's the sign.}
<B>__{her p.o.v.}
<A>__{hector continues to backswim slowly to the plane and the croc slowly follows.}
<C>__{gare}
<D>__{hector!!}
<A>__{we can hear the quaking fear in hector's voice. as he continues to slowly backswim.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(to gare; forced calm)}
<D>__{just turn the ignition, it's fuel injected.}
<A>__{gare turns the ignition, the engine kicks and dies.}
<C>__{gare}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{she turns it again and the engine turns over.}
<B>__{angle hector}
<A>__{the crocodile is still right with him as they inch closer and closer toward the chopper.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i know under the circumstances, biting off my head might seem viable. it would cheapen you.}
<A>__{but nothing's funny about this to hector now. what he's staring into is death. his own. gare raises her rifle.}
<C>__{gare}
<D>__{i might get a shot.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(fear in his voice)}
<D>__{no. if you don't kill him instantly, i'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry. and even if you were on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.}
<B>__{angle gare}
<C>__{gare}
<P>__{(re the croc)}
<D>__{jesus.}
<P>__{(to hector)}
<D>__{about twelve more yards. keep coming just like that.}
<B>__{angle hector}
<A>__{craning to see how far away he is and as soon as he breaks eye contact with the crocodile, it growls. hector quickly locks eyes with him again.}
<B>__{angle gare}
<C>__{gare}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<B>__{resume}
<A>__{by now hector is almost to the chopper, the croc is right there too. hector's right hand then goes slowly for his belt though it's impossible to discern why. the crocodile seems poised to finish him. there's a slight growl. and then suddenly, a small underwater pop, followed by an explosion out of the water. it's an inflatable life vest and as it pop tarts out of the water, the croc lunges for it. as the croc goes for the vest, hector makes his dash for the chopper. in almost an instant, he's climbing on board as the croc pulls the vest into darkness underwater. hector's up on the chopper's ski.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{move over!!}
<A>__{the crocodile's head comes thrusting up, its massive jaws snapping shut, missing hector by an inch, maybe two. hector dives into the chopper, screaming.}
<C>__{gare}
<D>__{go!!}
<A>__{she revs the chopper. the croc comes up again, chomping down on one of the landing skis. both gare and hector scream as the whole helicopter is jerked mightily.}
<C>__{gare }
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{go!!!}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i'm trying!!!}
<A>__{the croc releases and the chopper rights itself and begins to thrust off, when the croc surfaces again, mouth open. gare fires her revolver. it might as well shoot bb's. the croc is undaunted but he does miss the ski and by now the chopper is up and running, finally safely out of the reptile's reach.}
