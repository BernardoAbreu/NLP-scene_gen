<L>__{interior dante's inferno day}
<A>__{back at the table, the boys are soaked and huffing as if they just finished the boston marathon. the burgers have been served, but lloyd and harry are still too traumatized to touch them.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that really wasn't very polite of him, was it? maybe we should loosen the screws of his chair.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{harry dunne, i'm surprised at you. perhaps it's about time you brushed}
<A>__{up on a little tome that we god fearing adults call the bible. it's crammed with all kinds of pithy rules to live your life by.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(humbled)}
<D>__{you mean like 'turn the other cheek?'}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{no, i mean like 'an eye for an eye.' hand me those peppers the atomic ones.}
<A>__{harry passes the jar and the two of them load joe mental's}
<B>__{burger with chili}
<A>__{peppers, expertly camouflaging them with lettuce.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{here he comes.}
<A>__{lloyd and harry bite into their food as joe mental sits back down at the table.}
<C>__{mental}
<D>__{feeling any better, boys?}
<A>__{as he pours ketchup on his burger, the guys glance at each other and titter. then he picks it up and brings it to his mouth. just before biting into it, though, he pauses.}
<C>__{mental }
<D>__{so tell me, why you fellas headed to aspen? vacation?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{more like re location.}
<A>__{mental starts toward the burger but stops again.}
<C>__{mental}
<D>__{doesn't look like you packed much. all i saw was a couple bags... and that briefcase.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{the briefcase isn't even ours. some lady just left it at the airport. we're bringing it back to her.}
<A>__{this is news to mental.}
<C>__{mental}
<D>__{you mean you don't even know her?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{not really. i was just her limo river.}
<A>__{mental looks at the two of them and realizes that they're serious. then he breaks out}
<B>__{laughing.}
<C>__{mental}
<D>__{talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time...}
<A>__{lloyd and harry share a confused look. mental shakes his head and bites into his burger, chewing heartily. almost immediately, his happy demeanor is replaced by a look of horror. his face turns red, he grabs his stomach and falls}
<B>__{to the}
<A>__{ground, gasping. the boys look at each other guiltily, then bend down to help him.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hey, you okay, man? it was just a goof.}
<C>__{mental}
<P>__{(strained whisper)}
<D>__{my ulcer... quick... pills... in my coat...}
<A>__{harry checks mental's coat pocket for his antacid pills but unwittingly brings out the black of cyanide pills. he shakes some pills out and hands them to mental, who tosses them in his mouth and starts to munch on them. for a moment, he appears to improve. his breathing slows and he sits up. then his eyes}
<B>__{light up.}
<A>__{mental's pov quick zoom in on the black bottle harry is holding!}
<C>__{mental }
<D>__{you son of a bitch!}
<A>__{mental gurgles and keels over, dead.}
