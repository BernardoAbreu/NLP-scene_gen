<L>__{interior library night}
<A>__{still leaning out the window, we can see meg from here as she reaches the sidewalk and runs up the front steps of the neighbor's house, which is contiguous. straining to see (yet stay in the house), we see meg all the way at the right edge of the frame, as she shifts the gun to the back of her pants and knocks on the neighbor's door, sledgehammer held slightly behind her leg. after a long moment, we hear the neighbor's front door open. the conversation begins. the wind is gusting right in our faces, we can't make out the details, but the gist is clear let me into your house, and don't as me a lot of questions. the neighbor and by the tone of the voice it sounds like an old woman is slow to respond, grumpy. losing patience, meg just pulls the neighbor out of the way and shoves into the house. the neighbor stumbles out onto her front stoop, and we were right, it's an old lady in a nightgown, but she's no shrinking violet. in fact, she's royally pissed off and not at all intimidated.}
<C>__{neighbor}
<D>__{what the hell do you think you're doing, young lady?!}
<A>__{she storms back into her house, following meg. as both of them disappear from the frame, we move out of the library, into the foyer, and move along the common wall, the one shared with the neighbor's brownstone. from the other side of the wall, we can hear muffled voices, arguing, meg and the neighbor shouting at each other. we drift up, up the stairs, and hear the thundering of footsteps on the stairs next door. we keep pace with them, from inside this house. we pass right through the floor }
