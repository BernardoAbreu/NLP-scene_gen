<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Even though it was only a dream, I felt as if my struggle to reach dry land was terrifyingly real. The water was like ice, bone- chilling, cold, and as I made my way from one stone to the next I could feel my strength desert me.}

The song carries beautifully in the night. For the first time PK's focus is broken, but not like the others in the audience, who haven't a clue as to what's happening. He has heard this before. This is familiar. This is for him. A distant knowing flickers in his eyes like a man who has heard the voice of fate whisper his name. Over and over, one phrase is indistinguishable -- the chorus of the song. "Ono  bi shobi ingelosi." The chanting stops as suddenly as it began. A moment passes before the crowd begins to buzz with the phenomenon. The Announcer attempts to bring everyone's attention back to the business at hand.}

Jannie's big, overhand rights almost nail PK until he finds his footing and dances away. Jannie comes after him hard, his schoolmates bellowing encouragement. But PK's far superior boxing skills put Jannie at an immed- iate disadvantage. It is a classic battle of a boxer versus a fighter. PK's jabs keep Jannie at an arm's length, until he closes with a combination. Jannie, willing to take three punches to land one, absorbs PK's point scoring combinations and tries to land knockout punches. When he has had enough punishment he lunges into a clinch.}

<ACTION>__{pounds into Botha's ribs under another wild swinging punch by the giant. Botha shouts and keeps advancing, swinging. PK backs up, peppering him, leading him forward. Left-right. He punishes Botha for each punch the big man throws, but always backing up. Botha, half blind, spitting blood follows. The crowd screams for him to move side to side.   The betting changes fast and furious. PK glances over his  shoulder to the cement wall behind him. He takes two   more steps and then fires two jabs at Botha's face and  then stands stock still. Wild with anger, Botha throws  a huge right hand to PK's head.}
