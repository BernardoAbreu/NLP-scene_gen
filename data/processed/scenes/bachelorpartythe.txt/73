<L>__{interior. bmt subway hurtling northward}
<A>__{half past three, and the car is absolutely empty except for charlie and arnold. arnold is sprawled across the straw seat, one leg buckled beneath him, the other on the floor. he is sleeping heavily. charlie sits expressionlessly, obviously involved in deep introspection. the car buckets along into the night.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior. queens apartment house}
<A>__{arnold and charlie coming up to a landing. it is the third floor; we can see enough of the corridor to see two apartment doors, lettered "3d" and "3c." a small overhead bulb provides a thin sketchy light. charlie and arnold shuffle down the landing to apartment 3d. they pause outside the door. the scene is played in low mutters and whispers.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{well, thanks a lot, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you all right?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{yeah, i'm all right. i'm a little groggy, but i'm awake anyway. you don't want to come in, do you?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, i don't think so.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i think my father and mother are up. i hear voices. my girl must have called them because they wouldn't be up at this hour.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, you just go in and explain to them that you were drunk, and you're sorry, and you'll call your girl the first thing in the morning because she must really be upset about this.}
<C>__{arnold}
<P>__{(who has been}
<D>__{listening at}
<P>__{his door)}
<D>__{i think she's here.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{my girl. i think i hear her voice in there.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, be nice to her, arnold. remember, you woke her up in the middle of the night and probably scared her to death.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{what'll i say to her, charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't know, arnold. what do you feel like saying to her? do you really love this girl? do you want to marry her? are you marrying this girl because your family wants you to marry her, or why?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i think i like her, charlie. it's just that i'm afraid i won't make a good husband.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, tell her what you told me, arnold. tell her you're scared, and that you don't think you'll make a good husband. if she's a halfway decent girl, she'll try to understand how you feel, and, if she loves you, she's going to make it her job to make you happy. that's what love is, arnold, when you have somebody else in the world you want to be happy. my wife, arnold, i don't know what i'd do without her. arnold, i've got a tough grind ahead of me. work all day, i will go to night school at night. but my wife knows that i need this to be happy, and she does everything she knows to help me. and we've got a baby coming. but if you love that baby and you love your wife, then it's easy. everything seems so easy to me now i don't know why i even thought of quitting.}
<P>__{(tears have welled}
<D>__{in his eyes, and he hurriedly puts his hand to his face shading his reddening}
<P>__{eyes)}
<D>__{arnold, i want my wife so much right now. i want her to be happy. i want to just go home and hold her and tell her how much she means to me. i mean, even walter, he's going to die, but don't you think he'll be in tomorrow morning, same old walter, jokes and laughs? he's got somebody to live for. he's even got somebody to die for. i mean, how rich can a man be? and poor eddie i used to be so jealous of him. i used to think he was so free. free from what? from loving a woman, from really wanting a woman. arnold, what i'm trying to tell you is life is nothing if you don't love somebody but life is wonderful if you do love somebody. arnold, i want my wife so much right now ...}
<A>__{arnold is a little embarrassed by his friend's display of emotion and, frankly, hasn't understood a word charlie was talking about.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i'm going to tell her about that woman tonight and everything. i will tell her about that woman.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{arnold, i want to get home so much to my wife right now i'm going to bust.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i will see you, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{good bye, arnold, have a nice honeymoon. i will see you when you get back.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i will see you, charlie.}
<A>__{but he is talking to an empty staircase. charlie has plunged down into the darkness of the floor below. arnold turns and sighs and shuffles back to the door of his apartment. he rings the bell lightly, takes a deep breath. a moment, and the door opens. a girl of about thirty five, bespectacled, rather plain, with a sensitive face, stands in the doorway. arnold stands, his head down in shame.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{hello, louise. i'm very sorry, honest.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{sure, arnold, i know.}
<A>__{she looks anxiously over arnold's shoulder to see if anyone else is there. arnold lumbers past her into the apartment. voices, both male and female, pop out at him. "what's the matter with you, are you crazy?" "what's the matter with you?" "for heaven's sakes, where have you been?" ... the door closes.}
