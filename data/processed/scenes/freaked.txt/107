<A>__{stuey checks to make sure nobody's watching him. they're not. he removes the spring from a pocket pen and picks the lock. stuey searches the floor, and spots the pepsi cup. he'll have to crawl through several pairs of legs to reach it.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{at ees, our plans for your gene machine include everything, except shoes that is. ha ha ha.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{ha ha. gee, i'd love to see your plans.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{we'd love to show you.}
<P>__{(to his assistant)}
<D>__{bill, if you'd be so kind.}
<A>__{bill blazer, a slick and dashing ees marketing executive, strides confidently up to the podium. stuey has to duck the fast approaching legs. bill steps over him, not even noticing he's there. bill takes elijah's "freak world" graphic off an easel, and replaces it with his own. finding no place to deposit elijah's, he simply drops it on the floor. elijah looks a little hurt.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what does today's businessman want? how about a receptionist with six arms, five mouths, and a knockout figure? that'd sure speed things up, wouldn't it?}
<A>__{with a big smile, bill reveals an illustration of a multi limb secretary (in a sexy dress) talking on three different phones, taking notes, and typing, all at once. stuey heads towards the pepsi cup. he brushes against the back of hertz's legs. hertz looks over at elijah beside him, who smiles politely. hertz smiles back, invitingly. maybe there's a few things we don't know about him.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{in the factory, how 'bout a worker with twelve busy hands, no mouth to talk back, and no genitalia or digestive system to distract him from his work?}
<P>__{(he chuckles)}
<D>__{sure! it's what we all dream of!}
<A>__{the ees guys all nod along. except for the workmen, who exchange worried looks. elijah's still not sure what to make of it all. meanwhile, stuey has the pepsi cup of sludge in hand, and he's crawling under the table towards the door. he brushes up against the back of elijah's legs. elijah looks over to hertz, who gives him that smile again. elijah looks away quickly, panicky.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{well, with this skuggs based noxon technology, it's not only possible, it's just the beginning! of course, what happened to our expensive spokesman ricky coogan was an unfortunate coincidence, but profits from these new markets could total in the billions.}
<A>__{all the executives turn to hertz. he cracks a smile.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{ricky who?}
<A>__{the executives laugh heartily. stuey glances across the room to the door. he has to make a break for it, so he does.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{hey! hold on!}
<A>__{stuey freezes. he's right out in the open, in plain view. still, nobody seems to see him. they're still watching bill's presentation.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{secretaries? worker drones? where's the fun? where's the spark? where's the unspeakable evil?}
<A>__{bill laughs pleasantly.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{ha ha. i was just getting to that.}
<A>__{bill launches back into his speech with more intensity than even the best infomercials. meanwhile, stuey inches towards the door, moving as imperceptibly as possible.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{we'll impact every field. cosmetics breast enlargement creams, nosejobs in a bottle. military human death machines that make schwarzenegger look like a pansy! and why stop at consumer products? hell, we can design a whole new consumer! a few well placed drops in the water supply, and bingo! it's a new master race, and we own the copyright! an entire planet of freaks owned and operated by us! every part of their bodies comes from an ees supplier, every thought they think is ees policy! from now on gentlemen, it's ees uber alles! ees uber alles!}
<A>__{the ees guys clap and shout approval. elijah's impressed too. he leans over to hertz.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{this guy's good.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{we lured him away from a.t.&t.}
<A>__{stuey is finally out the door. of course, now they spot him.}
<C>__{security guy}
<D>__{look! the troll!}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{after him!}
