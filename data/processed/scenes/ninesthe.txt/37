<L>__{interior foyer night}
<A>__{his left hand cupped to hold the semen, he pads barefoot from the tv room to the downstairs bathroom. we hear water running as he washes his hands. then it shuts off. we hear a thunk. something hard was dropped on the wood floor. gary hears it too. he steps out of the bathroom, looks around. he takes a few silent paces back in our direction, stopping just before he reaches the two story section of the foyer. that's when he hears it: click click click click on the wooden floor. a jingle of metal. we follow gary's eyes up to the second floor walkway. we can hear the little footsteps, toe nails clicking. faint panting. but there's no dog. back on gary, increasingly unsettled. he's directly below the walkway, and can't see up into it.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{is somebody there? hello?}
<A>__{he claps his hands twice. listens. nothing. he's about to venture a step forward when suddenly}
<B>__{the phone rings.}
<A>__{he nearly jumps out of his skin. it rings two more times before he ducks into the tv room to answer it.}
<C>__{gary }
<D>__{hello?!}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{yes. yes.}
<A>__{he turns his back to the foyer, listening to the instructions on the phone.}
<C>__{gary }
<D>__{nine leopards run through the jungle.}
<P>__{(listening)}
<D>__{i bought two cakes at the store.}
<A>__{his identity evidently confirmed, he hangs up. he looks back into the foyer.}
<D>__{gary (pre lap) (cont'd) the house is haunted. there's a zeitgeist, or something.}
