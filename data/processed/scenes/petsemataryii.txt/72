<A>__{drew is at the bathroom mirror.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{hold still. hold still.}
<A>__{amanda puts the finishing touches of color on drew's lips. she's done an alarmingly good job of turning drew into the joker.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{you make sure you're home by ten. if gus finds out i let you go...}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{i will be home, mom. don't worry. i won't let gus blow up again...}
<A>__{amanda looks drew straight in the eyes.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{drew, i know gus isn't your father, but you never even knew your real father. he walked out on the both of us, and you remember that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{gus isn't that way. he has it in him to love us both. you just have to give him a chance...}
<A>__{drew nods respectfully. amanda gives him a kiss. drawing back, she rubs out the lipmarks she's left on his made up cheek.}
