<A>__{of dachau concentration camp: thousands of bodies are piled and bulldozed... and then back to jim at arlington cemetery reliving it... only the enormity of past evil can prepare him to confront present evil. in a strange way, it reassures him.}

<D>__{...don't underestimate the budget cuts kennedy called for in march of '63 either close to 52 military installations in 25 states, 21 overseas bases, you're talking big money. you know how many helicopters have been lost in vietnam? about three thousand so far. who makes them? bell helicopter. who owns bell? bell was near bankruptcy when the first national bank of boston approached the cia about developing the helicopter for indochina usage. how 'bout the f 111 fighters? general dynamics in fort worth. who owns that? find out the defense budget since the war began. $75 going on a hundred billion ... $200 billion'll be spent before it ends. in 1950 it was $13 billion. no war, no money. sometimes i think the organizing principle of any society is for war. the authority of the state over it's people resides in it's war powers. even eisenhower military hero of wwii warned us about it: "beware the military industrial complex", he said. kennedy wanted to end the cold war in his second term. he wanted to call of the moon race in favor of cooperation with the soviets. he signed a treaty with the soviets to ban nuclear testing, he refused to invade cuba in '62, and he set out to withdraw from vietnam. but that all ended on november 22, 1963.}
<A>__{flashback to the white house, 1963. lyndon johnson is with henry cabot lodge. we see them as shadowy figures from a distance across the wide room, or near a veranda with a porch and plenty of light. johnson, his back to us, talks in a loud, thick texas drawl (mostly muted) and signs a document.}

<D>__{only four days after j.f.k. was shot, lyndon johnson signed national security memo 273, which essentially reversed kennedy's new withdrawal policy and gave the green light to the covert operations against north vietnam that provoked the gulf of tonkin incident. in that document lay the vietnam war.}

<D>__{no chance in hell, mr. garrison. i'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse. you, too. i can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... keep digging. y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of john kennedy. that's important it's historic.}

<D>__{but you don't have a choice anymore. you've become a significant threat to the national security structure. they would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town. you're some kinda ego crazed southern caricature to many folks. be honest the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. you gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack. remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. i hope you get a break...}
