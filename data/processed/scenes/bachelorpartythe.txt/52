<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what's the matter with you?}
<A>__{charlie is off his seat and ready to belt eddie one right on the spot. there is abruptly the imminent reality of a fist fight. the two men are just sullen enough. arnold hurriedly intercedes.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{all right, all right, fellows.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{look, don't get so tough with me, charlie.}

<D>__{well, don't poke me.}
<C>__{arnold}
<P>__{(turning charlie back to his seat)}
<D>__{come on, let's go ... gee ...}
<A>__{for a moment, the sudden, thick hostility fills the silence in the room. nobody says anything. walter is soddenly preoccupied with his own thoughts. arnold is shaken from his recent experience with the woman and from the flaring of tempers. charlie just sits bleakly examining a book of matches he is toying with, trying to bring his temper down. after a moment, he mutters:}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(mutters)}
<D>__{you mess around with other women, it kills your wife and it kills your marriage.}
<A>__{eddie suddenly, sulkily strides for the door of the bar.}

<D>__{all right, you guys go home, and i will go on my merry way.}

<D>__{pauses, then turns, his sudden hot temper gone as quickly as}
<P>__{it had come)}
<D>__{hey, you guys, you guys want to go to a nutty night club, look at the nuts? there's a nutty night club over on second avenue. you know what we can do? charlie, you live in stuyvesant town, don't you?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you know what we can do? we'll take the crosstown. we'll go over to charlie's house, he'll get some money, and we'll go to this nutty night club. it's right down on second avenue. you got any money home, charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what do you say, arnold? you want to go?}
<A>__{arnold shrugs. eddie has started for the door already. charlie wearily gets off his stool, starts to follow eddie out. walter takes his arm.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{charlie, get walter.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{come on, walter....}
<A>__{closeup of walter}
<C>__{walter}
