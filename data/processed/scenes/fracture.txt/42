<A>__{metal chairs. bad light. crawford sits, cuffed, at a table, waiting. looks up as the door unlocks. a guard lets willy in, locks the door behind him. crawford watches willy take a legal pad, files, pens from his briefcase, set them on the table.}

<A>__{willy, now ready, lets crawford study him.}
<C>__{crawford}

<D>__{too busy getting up to speed on armstead pharmaceutical?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i'm not judging you. i think anyone coming from...what you came from then paying your way through east okie cowshit college and tulsa law by writing papers for princeton kids on the internet my god, it must have eaten your liver! sixty thousand dollars in debt, eighty four percent conviction rate: you deserve this.}
<A>__{willy tries to stay in control.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{what the hell have you been doing.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i'm permitted the use of a private investigator.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{not to investigate me!}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{why not? you're investigating me.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{you shot your wife.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{allegedly. that's how it works, right? if i can't introduce something in court as evidence it doesn't exist. legally.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{look i don't want to play games with you.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i'm afraid you have to.}
<A>__{beat. willy reconstructs his formal cool. takes some pages scrawled no from a folder, pushes them across the table.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{is this some form of communication?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{you sent me a box of papers.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{it's called discovery. the state has a legal obliga }
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{there's nothing in it, willy. you haven't 'discovered' anything. have you found the gun?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{not yet.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{does it bother you that i call you willy?}
<C>__{willy}
<P>__{(lies)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{crawford nods. pleased. leans forward.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i'd like you to consider becoming my lawyer. i will pay you. a lot of money.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i'm prosecuting you.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{yeah, but i'm offering you a chance to get on the right side of this whole mess while you still can.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{are you out of your mind?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i think on advice of counsel i will decline to answer that one.}
<A>__{willy studies him. decides: it's an elaborate act. begins to put away his papers.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i don't need the gun to convict you, by the way.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{she was cheating, you know.}
<A>__{willy looks at him, slightly taken aback. he didn't know; it wasn't in the confession. as he considers whether it makes a difference he notices crawford watching, enjoying. willy shuts his briefcase.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{it doesn't matter what she did...tom. what you did is a crime.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{perhaps. but maybe my so called peers will look at me and see themselves. betrayed. frustrated. humiliated. and you and i both know, willy, that people have an infinite capacity for believing in their own innocence.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{great. take the stand. tell your story. i'd appreciate it.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{not to mention the fact you have no actual evidence connecting me to the crime.}
<A>__{willy smiles, gets up.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{except your confession.}
<A>__{crawford watches him go to the door.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{my grandfather was an egg farmer.}
<A>__{willy stops, annoyed.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{is this gonna be about how you had a rough childhood?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i used to candle eggs at his farm. you know what that is? you hold an egg up to a light, and look for imperfections.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the first time i did it, he told me to put the ones that were cracked or flawed in a bucket for the bakery.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he came back an hour later and there were three hundred eggs in the bakery bucket. he asked me what the hell i was doing.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i found a flaw in every single one. thin places in the shell, minuscule cracks.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{look closely enough and you'll find everything has a weak spot...where it can break.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{looking for mine?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{no, i've found yours.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{illuminate me.}
<A>__{crawford considers how to put it.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{you're a winner, willy.}
<A>__{silence. willy pushes the call button by the door.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{huh. well. joke's on me then, i guess.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{yes. it is.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i will see you in court, mr. crawford.}
<A>__{the door unlocks. crawford winks. willy hesitates for a second then leaves.}
