<A>__{(dale, flash) the two pilots are gone, vanished without trace. wind from the shattered windows assaults flash as he charges in. he stumbles forward as the plane noses into a dive. recovering he scrambles into the left hand seat, grabs hold of the bucking wheel yoke, pulls back and kicks at the rudder pedals. dale lurches in against the tornado.}
