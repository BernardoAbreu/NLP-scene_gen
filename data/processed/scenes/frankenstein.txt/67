<L>__{int victor's garret night}
<A>__{the creature lies on an improvised bier of crates, surrounded by shadows and clutter, draped sprawled like christ taken from the cross in michelangelo's "pieta." beakers bubbling and dripping. intravenous lines seeping and secreting. a misty chemical haze in the air. victor is watching his patchwork man. glowering. waiting.}
<C>__{arctic victor }
<D>__{it took nutrients like a child receiving milk... blushed like a young girl with the blood i forced through its veins...}
<A>__{a flash of lightning rips through the skylights, bathing the scene purple white. eerier and eerier.}
<C>__{arctic victor }
<D>__{...all in preparation.}
<A>__{victor's garret day we find victor passed out in a chair. his creation is still taking fluids. gray daylight streams through the windows. there's commotion in the street outside: shouting, horses' hooves clattering on cobblestone, an occasional scream or wail. victor doesn't stir. dead to the world. somebody starts pounding on the door. victor rouses, takes a moment to remember where he is. he lurches from his chair, grabs a canvas tarp, throws it over his "patchwork man." stairwell day henry is pounding. finally the latch is drawn. the door swings open a crack. victor peers out. gaunt and furtive. suspicious. henry is stunned at his dissipated appearance.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{god's sake, what is that stench?}
<A>__{henry peers past him. victor shifts, blocking his view}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{this is a bad time, henry. i'm busy just now. what do you want?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. thousand new cases a day now. classes have been suspended. university's shut down.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{yes? and?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{listen to what i'm saying. the militia's arriving to quarantine the city. most of us are getting out while we still can.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you'll be leaving then.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just as well. you never were cut out for this, henry. goodbye.}
<A>__{and the door slams shut. the bolt is thrown. henry pounds.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{victor! open the door! listen to reason!}
<A>__{nothing. stunned and hurt, henry turns from the door and heads back down the stairs.}
