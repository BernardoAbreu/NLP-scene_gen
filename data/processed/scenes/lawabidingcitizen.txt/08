<L>__{interior city hall conference room day}
<A>__{clyde is seated, speaking slowly and precisely. angle widens, revealing the room, light filtering through blinds, as:}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{when i found my wife and child dead, my little girl's eyes were open.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{the last thing she saw of this earth were the faces of the men who took her life. can you understand that?}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{yes. yes, i can.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{can you? really?}
<P>__{(looks to somebody else)}
<D>__{you?}
<C>__{cantrell }
<D>__{mr. clyde. i don't see this helping.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{no? you married? children?}
<A>__{angle has now widened drifted to include d.a. jonas cantrell, senior attorney for the state. he wears thick glasses and is suffering the early stages of macular degeneration.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{divorced. i have a son and daughter. both in college.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{my daughter was ten. i married late in life.}
<A>__{clyde spreads the crime scene photos further on the table. angle comes around to reveal the third man in the room:}
<B>__{nick price}
<A>__{the d.a. under cantrell focused, exceptional at what he does, the man you'd want on your side.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{you, mr. price? married? kids?}
<A>__{nick doesn't answer, stays focused on the task:}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i've seen the crime scene photos, mr. clyde. many times. they're horrifying. but they don't alter the facts of the case.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{facts? those men are guilty. both of them. you know they are.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{this isn't about what we know. it's about what we can prove in court.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{things have gone against us. tainted crime scene, evidence thrown out...}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{maybe you just haven't tried hard enough.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{look. we've had only one real break in this case. the fact that one asshole has decided to testify against the other asshole.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{in return for immunity. so he gets away with it.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{the other man doesn't. he'll go down for the crime. that has to count for something.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{yes. it counts for half.}
<P>__{(pause, quietly)}
<D>__{don't reward one of the men who murdered my family. please.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{mr. clyde. i can't claim to know what it's like to be in your position. losing your wife and child. but please try to grasp how limited our options are. this is how the justice system works.}
<A>__{clyde sits for a long moment, numb, absorbing this.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{ah. i see my mistake. i came for justice. instead i got a system.}
