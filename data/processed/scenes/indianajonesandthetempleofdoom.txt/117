<L>__{95. interior the temple of death}
<A>__{as the camera pulls back, the mouth of the wind tunnel in which they are standing becomes just a small hole overlooking the stag gering vastness of the incredible temple of death. the colossal subterranean temple has been carved out of a solid mass of rock. a vaulting cathedral like ceiling is supported by rows of carved stone columns. balconies overlook the temple floor. pillared halls leading to dark side chambers. moving out of these chambers, hundreds of faithful worshippers chant as they enter the temple. mammoth stone statues of elephants, lions and demi gods (half man, half animal monstrosities) loom above the swelling crowds or wor shippers. as the wind howls out of the tunnel high above the temple, the worshippers chant in response to the strange tunnel music.}
