<L>__{ext park later}
<A>__{behind the indianapolis museum of art is 152 acres of gardens and grounds. hazel and gus walk together.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{is this where you bring all your romantic conquests?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{every last one.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{probably why i'm still a virgin.}
<A>__{hazel laughs, elbows him.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you're not a virgin.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{are you really?}
<A>__{gus picks a stick up from the dirt. draws a big circle in it.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{see this? this circle is virgins...}
<A>__{now gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{and this... is 17 year old dudes with one leg.}
<A>__{hazel laughs. point made. he grabs her hand, helps her walk up a tiny hill. once up there, gus lays a blanket on the ground. they sit, looking out over a rather odd sculpture a set of giant white bones where children can jump and play.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(explaining)}
<D>__{"funky bones" by joep van lieshout.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{he sounds dutch.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{and he is. much like rik smits. and tulips.}
<A>__{hazel raises an eyebrow at gus. he's sure taking this amsterdam dutch thing pretty far. he removes some sandwiches and orange juice out of a basket.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{sandwich?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{let me guess }
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{dutch cheese. and tomato.}
<P>__{(she takes one)}
<D>__{the tomatoes are mexican. sorry.}
<A>__{they eat for a second, their eyes watching the children play on the bones.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{how cool is that? a skeleton being used as a playground.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you do love your symbols.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{speaking of which...}
<A>__{gus stands up, takes a cigarette, puts it in his mouth. he clears his throat.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you're probably wondering why you're sitting here eating a bad cheese sandwich and drinking orange juice with a guy in a rik smits jersey.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{it has crossed my mind.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hazel grace, like so many before you and i say this with great affection you spent your wish... moronically.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i was thir }
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hush! i'm in the midst of a grand soliloquy here.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{sorry. please, continue...}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you were young. impressionable. the grim reaper staring you in the face. and the fear of dying with your one true wish left ungranted led you to rush into making one you didn't really want, for how could little hazel grace, having never read "an imperial affliction" ever know that her one true wish was to visit mr. peter van houten in his amsterdamian exile.}
<A>__{hazel nods in agreement.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{if you were smart, you would have saved your wish til the time in your life when you really knew your true self.}
<A>__{gus stops talking. hazel is confused.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{but i... didn't save it.}
<A>__{gus smiles.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{good thing i saved mine.}
<A>__{hazel cocks her head to one side. what is he talking about?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{got it in exchange for the leg.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i still have it.}
<A>__{she starts to realize.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{are you saying }
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i'm not gonna give you my wish or anything. but i too have an interest in meeting peter van houten and it wouldn't make much sense to meet him without the girl who introduced me to his book, now would it?}
<P>__{(hazel's eyes widen)}
<D>__{i talked to the genies and they're in total agreement.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we leave on may third.}
<A>__{hazel is so excited that she grabs gus and pulls him into a hug. their faces close, lips inches apart, and just when it looks like something might happen }
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{wait a minute.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you only doing this so i will kiss you?}
<A>__{a beat. gus blinks a few times.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{cause i'd totally kiss you either way.}
<A>__{and kiss him she does. he's surprised. and when it's over, they sit back, look at one another. a magic moment.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{seriously... why are you doing this?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{because hazel grace... i found my wish.}
<A>__{and hazel is beyond touched. we hear:}
<C>__{frannie }
<D>__{are you out of your mind?}
