<A>__{stores of every type offer gaudy displays of consumer items. everything from clothing to appliances. photo equipment; audio and video outlets; sporting goods and weaponry; gourmet foods and natural organic foods. there is a book store, a record store, a real estate agency and a bank; a novelty shop, a gift shop; all with the absolute latest in american consumer items. and at either end of the concourse like the main altars at each end of a cathedral, stand the mammoth two storey department stores; great symbols of a consumer society. down the centre of the ground floor, along with the gardens and park benches, are little stalls. one is a tobacco specialist another jewellery; another is a small photo portrait stall where mothers had their children photographed. there are restaurants and snack bars and numerous coin operated machines selling everything from children's toys to blood pressure readings. there is a large turntable, designed to spin but which is now still, holding a late model car on exhibit. another turntable displays futuristic household appliances. the images are all too familiar, but in their present state they appear as an archaeological discovery revealing the gods and customs of a civilisation now gone. the ghosts of a civilisation, however, are not figments in the mind. they are quite real. and they walk below in the aisles of the great cathedral. at least twenty zombies can be seen from the troopers' perspective.}
