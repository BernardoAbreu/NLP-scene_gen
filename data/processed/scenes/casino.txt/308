<L>__{interior vegas restaurant night}
<A>__{ace and ginger, dressed for dinner just like any other couple, walk towards a table overlooking the colorful lights of downtown vegas.}
<C>__{maitre d'}
<D>__{...good evening. signora.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{gino.}
<C>__{maitre d'}
<D>__{this way.}
<C>__{ace }
<P>__{(as they are led to their table)}
<D>__{the good part was, i had amy back. so, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, i calmed myself down and we went to dinner. i tried to keep things nice and civil, you know. but... hey, twenty five thousand for three suits? that doesn't make much sense.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(seated across from ginger at a booth)}
<D>__{first of all, he's not gonna wear f thousand dollar suits. but let's say he did, which he won't. how you gonna get fitted for twenty five suits in three days? i, um, i mean, how could you get fitted that fast? i can't get fitted that fast, and i pay twice as much.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{i bought him a watch too.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{but even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{at the most, which is impossible for him.}
<A>__{she glances to the table behind them.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. that still leaves what? around ten thousand?}
<C>__{ginger}
<P>__{(staring down at her plate, trying to restrain herself)}
<D>__{would you knock it off, sam?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{i'm just tryin' to figure it out.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{there's nothin' to figure out. i'm home... we're workin' it out.}
<A>__{she lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{yeah, but i've been told that before, 'we're workin' it out.' you think that you're home... after what you just put me through with amy, is a favor to me?}
<A>__{she looks at ace.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{so, counting the watch, let's say another four thousand for expenses over the weekend... of which you must have had a good time. i know he did. that's for sure. i know that... fuckin' piece of shit had a good fuckin' time. on my money. you might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway.}
<A>__{ginger glares at him.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{you're lookin' at me a certain way. you you're teary eyed, huh? you're upset. you're a good actress, you know that? good fuckin' actress. you can fuckin' get that pity out of people. i'm not a john, you understand? you always thought i was, but i'm not. and i'm not a sucker. that fuckin' pimp cocksucker. he's lucky i didn't kill him last time. lucky he's fuckin' livin'. and if you would've stayed with amy... and you would've ran away... you would've been fuckin' dead.}
<A>__{ginger scoots out of the booth and leaves.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{both of you. dead. dead.}
