<L>__{interior logan's room night}
<B>__{screaming}
<A>__{logan's screaming as he comes to. logan's eyes flash open. he looks up and sees a figure looming over him. in a flash he reacts. thud. nothing more. then silence. the door bursts open and cyclops stands in the doorway shocked. frozen. jean is next and finally storm. they can only stare. logan sits upright in bed, claws extended, into rogue's chest. she is literally frozen at the end of his arm. finally, cyclops breaks the silence and moves to grab her.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{don't touch her.}
<A>__{cyclops freezes. logan finally pulls his claws free and retracts them. rogue staggers, she pitches forward and touches his face gently with her hands, as though she would like him to be the last thing she sees on this earth. logan and rogue, locked in a fatal moment of tenderness snaring a look of loneliness that only they can understand. but suddenly, logan seems to change. and before he can say another word, he begins to tremble, then he starts to howl in pain. rogue snaps back, mouth open in a gaping, silent scream. what sound comes out does not match the expression at all. merely a gasp, like steam escaping. through the huge slash in her clothes, we see the wound on her chest slowly vanish. before long, she transforms back into a healthy young girl with no sign of injury. then, her escaping breath begins to accelerate, much in the way logan's did too much like logan's did. it is as if she has taken in his trait of berserker rage. soon she is smashing things all around her. one hand rakes the wallpaper like claws. finally, she gets a hold of herself, becoming the introverted rogue we all know so well. then she stands slowly, looks at the others. and she runs from the room. storm runs after her. the rest turn to logan, who lays on the floor, convulsing. jean goes to help him. she looks back at cyclops. his expression makes it clear that his worst fears about logan have come to pass.}
