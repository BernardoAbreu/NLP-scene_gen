<L>__{exterior park day}
<A>__{a beautiful blue sky. and "lucy in the sky with diamonds" continues as lucy's three year old laughing face swings into frame on a swing then disappears out the other end of frame. now lucy swings back down and out of the other end again... sam's face, glowing with delight, appears against the sky and then disappears. sam and lucy are on swings surrounded by mothers and kids at the park.}

<D>__{daddy, where does the sky end?}
