<D>__{stay there. keep your eyes closed. one final lock, one final key.}
<A>__{david unlocks double doors in a wall with a plastic key card. buzz click! the camera holds on bean, his eyes tight shut. the lights go up on bean's face, a magical golden glow.}

<D>__{right. open now.}
<A>__{cut round and there is this beautiful and very famous painting, lovingly shot. music. atmosphere. glory. bean opens his eyes and looks at the painting.}

<D>__{i'11 leave you with her for a few minutes. i'm sure you'll want to give her a proper inspection. but whatever you do, don't leave the room. megasecurity, okay? catch you.}
<A>__{bean nods. david leaves him. bean is still for a while and then goes up and inspects it closely. he tuts disapprovingly as he spots dust on the bottom of the frame. he blows it away fussily. he steps back to admire the painting. there is dust up his nose and... sneeze all over the painting! he takes out his handkerchief and wipes the spittle off in panic. then looks back at the painting. unfortunately, there now seems to be a big blue mark right across mrs whistler's face.. bean checks his handkerchief. yes, there's wet ink all over it. he finds the leaking pen in his pocket. 0 god. he takes out his shirt, spits on it and tries to wipe the painting, but he can't make the shirt reach it. he takes the painting down from the wall and has another go. no good! the ink just spreads right over whistler's mother's pure white collar. bean now looks round in panic. what the hell can he do? he goes to the heavy door and looks out into the corridor. he hears someone coming, hides and sees a young girl from the catering staff wheeling a slightly squeaky trolley past, covered with a white cloth. he goes back in and has an idea. he goes to a little table in the corner and begins to take thing off it.}
