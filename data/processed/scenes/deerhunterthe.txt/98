<L>__{exterior cratered roadside following day}
<A>__{refugees are streaming down the road in a desperate, frightened human torrent. there is every imaginable means of conveyance from bullock carts to motorbikes but the vast majority, carrying their meager belongings, are fleeing on foot. the burned out car is still in the middle of the road and the great human tide streams around it, as if it were an island. in the distance comes the sound of machine gun fire and mortars are coming in nearby. medvac helicopters clatter overhead with wounded strapped to baskets on the skids. now and then an army convoy comes through, blasting the refugees into the ditch. merle sits alone on the embankment by the side of the road. nick and sal are gone and the area is littered with fresh bandage packages and throw away medical supplies. suddenly a jeep pulls up with a two star general in it.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{where's your unit, soldier?}
<A>__{merle stares at the general blankly, without comprehension. finally, after a long moment, he gives a slight shrug.}
<C>__{general}
<P>__{(to his driver)}
<D>__{c'mon. we'll take him along.}
<A>__{the general and the driver get out and start up the embankment toward merle.}
<C>__{general }
<D>__{little r and r and you'll be standing tall again, son... damn, this is steep!}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{uh oh. sir.}
<A>__{the general looks up at merle. merle is holding the pearl handled revolver and he cocks the hammer with an audible click.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{uh oh.}
<A>__{the general and the driver turn tail, scramble back down the embankment and pile in the jeep.}
<C>__{general }
<P>__{(as they take off)}
<D>__{y'know, there's more fucking maniacs coming out of this conflict...}
<A>__{merle watches them go without expression. on the road below the refugees stream past by the hundreds, by the thousands, by the tens of thousands. for a long moment merle watches, then he jams the gun in his pants and stands.}
