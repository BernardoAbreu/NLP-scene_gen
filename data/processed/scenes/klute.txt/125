<A>__{on the left a portion of the original obscene letter. on the right a series of comparison documents beginning with a portion of a personal letter. we hear trask's, klute's voices over, and occasionally cut to them as }
<C>__{trask's voice}
<P>__{(skipping, summarizing)}
<D>__{all right, there's tom grunemann, you're right, different margins, different spacing absolutely, sloppy, right.}
<C>__{klute's voice}
<D>__{mm.}
<C>__{trask's voice}
<D>__{all right, try this next guy.}
<A>__{the right hand document is switched. klute, trask klute reacts.}
<C>__{trask}
<D>__{think this is our guy?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{i don't know. it looks familiar to me.}
<C>__{trask}
<D>__{thought it might. it's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. man you wanted samples of everybody.}
<A>__{then with subdued satisfaction, switching the projector again.}
<C>__{trask }
<D>__{now the next cat. mm?}
<A>__{screen; documents}
<C>__{trask's voice}
<D>__{same margins top and sides. he does best with his middle fingers; you get fainter registration from outside keys like q, a, l, p and like that. next thing look around apostrophes, how he hits the space bar before }

<D>__{i knew tom never wrote that letter.}
<C>__{trask}
<D>__{what else do you know?}
<C>__{klute}

<C>__{trask}
<D>__{we have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder there's not even a body.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{i don't believe tom's alive.}
<A>__{as klute talks he paces back and forth in the darkness. he crosses in front of the lighted screen; the letters projected on the screen ripple over his face.}
<C>__{klute }
<D>__{but why? why?}
