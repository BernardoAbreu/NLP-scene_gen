<A>__{the townspeople fill the booths, line the walls. they talk excitedly amongst themselves, break into spontaneous applause as ford and the postman enter. the postman is surprised, uncomfortable at this display. but then he sees that a banquet has been laid out on the counter. the centerpiece is a huge vat of steaming stew. the people clear a path for him.}
<D>__{man #1 tell us about the government! woman #1 yes, tell us everything!}
<A>__{startled, the postman doesn't quite know what to say. they seat him at a table but the food looks miles away.}
<D>__{man #2 is there a president?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{yeah. woman #2 what's his name?}

<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{his name is, uh... richard starkey. from maine. he has a saying. 'things are getting better, getting better all the time.'}

<D>__{man #3 he a democrat or a republican?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{parties are over with. the individual is what counts. you vote for the best man.}
<A>__{ellen sets a steaming bowl of stew in front of the postman. famished, he digs in.}

<D>__{woman #4 and the holnists? they're still out there. what's the government going to do about them?}
<A>__{the postman looks at the desperate faces he'd rather get back to his meal but this may be the most important question of all. he doesn't want to lie.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{the government's just getting started. you're on your own for at least eighteen months. man #5 what about the marines corp?}
<A>__{a clamor of holnist questions.}
