<A>__{'s room we hear the distant voice of preysing and the keys of the typewriter rattling. the reason for the blackness is that preysing's back is flat into the camera. his hands are behind his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly. it is an odd effect. we don't know quite what it is.}
<C>__{preysing's voice}
<D>__{both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.}
<A>__{preysing moves forward showing that we are in preysing's room. the change of light shows us plainly the time lapse. flaemmchen is seated at a small table typing. preying strides forward as he strides he says:}

<A>__{during this, flaemmchen, who is tired sits back and rubs her fingers that have been over worked. she glances at her wrist watch. preysing comes and stands behind flaemmchen.}
<C>__{preysing}

<D>__{his mouth and walks away. as he walks}

<C>__{flaemmchen}
<D>__{i don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty if she does her work well, seems so silly. i don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. personally, i hate offices i'd much rather be in the movies.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{movies?}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<D>__{yes, i photograph very well. look }
<A>__{she tosses magazine as if it were nothing at all over to him. he looks down at it without touching it.}
