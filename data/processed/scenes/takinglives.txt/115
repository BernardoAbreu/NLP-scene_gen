<L>__{interior costa's apartment night (3:33 a.m.)}
<A>__{spacious, lofty. costa and grace enter.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{careful.}
<A>__{costa scoots aside a pile of clothing. the newspapers. cool art, sketches, images all over the walls. reminiscent of grace's hotel room. and a very cool view of downtown. grace taking everything in. art books, sketch pads. piled high on the desk. she looks at the ceiling. sees notes and sketches taped up. grace laughs to herself.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's a sty. must be a profiling mother lode.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i'm done profiling you. i got you figured out.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{a failed healer, a failed artist.}
<A>__{grace looking at a drawing on the wall. costa winces, he didn't want her to notice it.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{is that how you see yourself?}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{no. that's you. i did it last night.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{this is how you see me?}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{no. it's how i think you see yourself.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{and how do you see me?}
<A>__{costa licks his lips.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{that would be out of bounds.}
<A>__{grace looking at him. costa looking at her. a staring match. costa and grace try not to laugh. they end up giggling.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i don't know. john, games are fun. but head games are dangerous.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{then keep your head out of it.}
<A>__{a beat. grace shrugs, back to business.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{the justice minister is going to relocate you to another city until mr. asher is in custody.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{i don't know what your deal is. one second you're so there, then all i get is the badge.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i apologize if you've been getting the wrong signal.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{yeah. relocate where?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{another province. they want you on a flight tomorrow morning.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{this monster comes into my life and i have to leave?}
<A>__{a uniform sergeant enters.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{my people are in place.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{thank you, sergeant.}
<A>__{the sergeant exits.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{this is surreal. what do i pack?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what you need. movers can get the rest.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{i need tomorrow morning to finish up my business here.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i will let them know.}
<A>__{this is goodbye. neither of them feels very good about it.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{i thought you were going to check under my bed.}
<A>__{grace smiles, plays along, crosses, looks under the bed, stretching for costa. driving him nuts.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no monsters.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{grace holds out her hand. they shake.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i probably won't see you again until the trial. if there is a trial.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{goodbye, then.}
<A>__{costa leans across her, braces himself against the wall. a bold move. now they are eye to eye. grace kisses costa for a long beat. grace breaks the kiss. holds a finger to her lips; shhh. she turns and exits. the door shuts behind her. costa is going to miss grace.}
