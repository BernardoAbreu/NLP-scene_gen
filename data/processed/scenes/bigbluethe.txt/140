<L>__{exterior committee boat docking day}
<A>__{officials, novelli, lawrence, roberto and of course enzo disembark. there is a lot of excitement on the dock. everyone has already heard the news. people swarm around enzo. lawrence spots jacques in the crowd, and goes to him.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{good huh?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{he really was unbelievable, 328 feet, deeper than the world record...}
<P>__{(then eagerly)}
<D>__{... and, jacques! he held his breath for four minutes and fifty seconds!}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(smiles too)}
<D>__{good... i guess i have tomorrow's work cut out for me as enzo would say...}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{you must be very careful, jacques. at these depths, to hold your breath for over five minutes is... you'd really be pushing it. i think it's very, very dangerous.}
<A>__{jacques sees enzo being carried past on the shoulders of the crowd. he ignores lawrence, runs beside enzo.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{enzo, enzo! congratulations!}
