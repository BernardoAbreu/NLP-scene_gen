<D>__{right?}
<P>__{(nothing)}
<D>__{a person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their luck. maybe my nature does draw me to you, but i don't haveta go with that. i can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! i can do that. otherwise, what is this stupid life that god gave us for what?}
<P>__{(pause, nothing)}
<D>__{ronny? are you listening to me?}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{i'm really afraid.}
<C>__{ronny}

<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{i don't know. everything seems like nothing now against that i want you in my bed. i don't care if i burn in hell. i don't care if you burn in hell. the past and future is a joke to me now. i see that they're nothing, i see they ain't here. the only thing that's here is you. and me. i want you to come upstairs. now. i tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but i couldn't. i couldn't take everything in a hundred years. it's the way we are. we compound each other.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{let me go home.}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{let me go home.}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{i'm freezing to death.}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{come upstairs. i don't care why you come. no, that's not what i mean. loretta, i love you. not like they told you love is and i didn't know this either. but love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. we're not here to make things perfect. snowflakes are perfect. the stars are perfect. not us. we are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! the storybooks are bullshit. come upstairs with me, baby! don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! red meat just like me! it's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! you're a wolf just like me! come upstairs with me and get in my bed! come on! come on! come on!}
<A>__{loretta follows ronny into his building.}
<B>__{now we see the street}
<A>__{just as the door shuts. a moment passes. lights go on in ronny's apartment. out of a doorway on the opposite side of the street steps the figure of a woman. she walks to the middle of the deserted street and looks up at the lighted windows. now we see the woman close up it's chrissy from the bakery her heart is about to break. she loves this man. she looks up at the lighted windows, her feelings hanging by one slender, slender thread.}
<B>__{music}
<A>__{it's "mimi's aria" from the snow scene in la boheme.}
<B>__{we see the street with the figure looking}
<A>__{at the lighted window above. "mimi's aria" plays. this tableau reminds us of the scene in the opera where mimi stands in the snow. the music plays and the woman sings for a long moment. then, the lights in the apartment go out. chrissy shudders almost imperceptibly. her heart has broken. she hangs her head. then she lifts her head and slowly walks away down the street.}
