<C>__{kale}
<D>__{i know, he's a total freak, right?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{and very vague... did he genuinely mean it was nice meeting you or was he sending you a "sinister message?"}

<D>__{are you messing with me?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{maybe a little. did you even notice my hair?}

<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{with the non dent dent }
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{the bumper sticker, the argument, the staring contest and now he's showing up in my kitchen }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{why, because he slashed your mom's tire?}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{ashley rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{kale }
<P>__{(pointing out window)}
<D>__{her car hasn't moved.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{it's called "the day after," kale. nobody moves after a night like that.}
