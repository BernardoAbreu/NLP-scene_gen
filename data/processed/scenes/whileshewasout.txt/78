<A>__{the light illuminates the small cabin of an earth moving truck. the cabin glows like a box in the darkness. there's a figure inside: it's chuckie. he's inspecting a powerful construction flashlight. he switches settings from broad light to concentrated beam. he points the beam through the broken glass window onto tomas, who's standing on a truck tyre knocking out the rest of the glass with his elbow. chuckie leaps down through the broken window, pleased with his find. he switches it to broad beam, whistles.}

<D>__{won't be long before we find her now. this baby could spot a needle in a haystack!}
<A>__{the light dances around illuminating each of their faces for seconds at a time. eerie distorted glimpses. they're traipsing along the rough road, through the mud, towards della. their voices grow louder.}
