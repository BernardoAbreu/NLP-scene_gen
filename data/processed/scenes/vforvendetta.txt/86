<L>__{interior leader's office}
<A>__{finch snaps dr. surridge's journal shut. he sits in front of the leader's desk puffing on his pipe while susan stares coldly.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{that's the last entry until six months later when dr. surridge is back in london. there is no mention of the man in room five again. end of story.}
<A>__{he tosses the journal on susan's desk.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{except that it wasn't the end of the story.}
<A>__{finch rises, crossing to the wastebasket.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{between 2009 and 2012, over forty men and women who were previously stationed at larkhill met with what were believed to be accidental deaths. eventually, only three remained.}
<A>__{he taps his pipe into his hand, pouring the contents into the wastebasket.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{the three he'd been saving until last.}
<A>__{finch brushes the ashes from his hands and begins repacking his pipe.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{everyone who worked at larkhill. everyone who could have identified him. you see there are two possible motives here. not one.}
<A>__{susan raises his head.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{the first is revenge. he escapes from larkhill and vows to get even with his tormentors. the whole exercise an elaborate, chilling vendetta.}
<A>__{when he finishes repacking the pipe, he replaces it in his mouth.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{that's the explanation that i find most reassuring, funnily enough. because that means he's finished. it's over now.}
<A>__{finch begins relighting his pipe.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{the second motive is more sinister. like i said, everyone who could have identified him is dead.}
<A>__{a flame leaps into the air.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{what if he's just been clearing the ground?}
<A>__{another burst.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{what if he's planning something else?}
<A>__{the lighter slips back into his pocket.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{you see, the diary we found was in full view. we didn't have to search for it. he left it there. he wanted us to find it. he wanted us to know the story. or...}
<A>__{finch returns to his chair, letting out a huge cloud.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{for all we know, the diary could be a complete and utter fake. codename v could have written it himself.}
<A>__{finch leans forward.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{he's playing games with us. he might never have been at larkhill at all. do you see? it could all be another smoke screen, a false trail, another cover story }
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{enough!}
<A>__{susan punches the desk.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{mr. finch, would you please explain to me the nature of this meeting?! because i was under the impression that you had some information about the terrorist, codename v!}
<A>__{and punches it again until his fist hurts.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{no more questions, understand! i want answers! i am not interested in where he grew up, what kind of flowers he likes or his favorite color!}
<A>__{susan's collar chokes his face to an unnatural crimson.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{do i make myself clear?}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{yes, leader.}
<A>__{after a moment, finch stands, susan hanging on his last word.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{dismissed. england prevails, mr. finch.}
<A>__{finch turns, susan calling after him as he leaves.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{mr. finch, the girl. do you have anything on the girl?}
<A>__{finch pauses at the door.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{no, leader. not yet.}
