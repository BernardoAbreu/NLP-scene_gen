<A>__{(spring `96) the troops roar as jordan takes center stage.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i'm sure many of you have been hearing rumors lately, about me, about the future of this firm, and that's what i'd like to talk to you about today.}
<P>__{(a few beats, then)}
<D>__{five years ago when i started stratton with donnie azoff, i knew the day would eventually come when i'd be moving on. it's truly with a heavy heart that i tell you that day is here.}
<A>__{the place erupts in a chorus of "no!", "don't go!", etc. jordan raises his hand for quiet.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{thank you for that and for your years of incredible loyalty and admiration.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{the point is though, that under donnie's leadership, along with robbie feinberg and nicky koskoff moving into key management positions, this place is gonna be better than ever!}
<A>__{a smattering of applause. jordan notices a few brokers gravely shaking their heads.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{and the fact that i'm gone won't stop me from giving donnie advice, not that he needs any }
<C>__{donnie}
<P>__{(jumping in)}
<D>__{why would anyone in their right mind not follow jb's advice?}
<A>__{donnie looks petrified; he's used to being an offensive tackle, not the quarterback.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{before i go, there's something i want to remind you all, and that's this stratton oakmont is bigger than any one person, even me. especially me. you guys are stratton, each and every one of you, and that is why it's sure to remain the best brokerage firm in the fucking world!}
<A>__{thunderous applause spreads through the boardroom, all}
