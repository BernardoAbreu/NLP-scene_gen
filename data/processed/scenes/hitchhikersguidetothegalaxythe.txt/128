<D>__{a & s swoop down and soar over the english countryside partially constructed; tall tree stocks with branch and leaves lying beside them, waiting to be attached. men rolling out sod like a giant carpet, etc.}

<D>__{i don't know, perhaps i'm old and tired, but i always think that the chances of finding out what's really going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is say hang the sense of it and keep yourself busy. i'd much rather be happy than right any day.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{and are you?}
<C>__{slartibartfast}
<D>__{no. that's where it all falls down of course.}
<P>__{(slowing the platform)}
<D>__{here we are, then.}
<A>__{l03 the platform slows to a stop. arthur steps out and is stunned to see... his house. it's partially constructed. the chimney lies intact on the ground, waiting to be hoisted up. a row of hedges lies on it's side beside a trench. but it's his house alright.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{is this...?}
<A>__{slartibartfast nods. arthur, in a daze, stumbles toward the house.}
