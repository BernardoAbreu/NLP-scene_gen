<L>__{interior death star garbage room}
<A>__{han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck. luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. he finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. it won't budge.}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{oh! the garbage chute was a really wonderful idea. what an incredible smell you've discovered! let's get out of here! get away from there...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no! wait!}
<A>__{han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. the laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room. everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes almost on top of them. leia climbs out of the garbage with a rather grim look on her face.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{will you forget it? i already tried it. it's magnetically sealed!}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{put that thing away! you're going to get us all killed.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{absolutely, your worship. look, i had everything under control until you led us down here. you know, it's not going to take them long to figure out what happened to us.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{it could be worse...}
<A>__{a loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the murky depths. chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins to back away. han and luke stand fast with their laser pistols drawn. the wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{it's worse.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{there's something alive in here!}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{that's your imagination.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{something just moves past my leg! look! did you see that?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{help!}
<A>__{suddenly luke is yanked under the garbage.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{luke! luke! luke!}
<A>__{solo tries to get to luke. luke surfaces with a gasp of air and thrashing of limbs. a membrane tentacle is wrapped around his throat.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{luke!}
<A>__{leia extends a long pipe toward him.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{luke, luke, grab a hold of this.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{blast it, will you! my gun's jammed.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{anywhere! oh!!}
<A>__{solo fires his gun downward. luke is pulled back into the muck by the slimy tentacle.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{luke! luke!}
<A>__{suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and move in a couple of inches. then everything is deathly quiet. han and leia give each other a worried look as chewbacca howls in the corner. with a rush of bubbles and muck luke suddenly bobs to the surface.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{grab him!}
<A>__{luke seems to be released by the thing.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i've got a very bad feeling about this.}
<A>__{before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and edge toward the rebels.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{the walls are moving!}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{don't just stand there. try to brace it with something.}
<A>__{they place poles and long metal beams between the closing walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant trashmasher rumbles on. the situation doesn't look too good.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{wait a minute!}
<A>__{luke pulls out his comlink.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{threepio! come in threepio! threepio! where could he be?}
