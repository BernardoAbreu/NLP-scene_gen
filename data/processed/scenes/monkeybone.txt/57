<L>__{interior death's office continuous day}
<A>__{a flunky opens the office door, and a long line of reapers glides in. death lugs an enormous musty leather bound book over to a long table. he snaps his fingers and whistles. his pet hellhound a tiny plump weiner dog, with a horned death's head for a face, comes skittering across the office floor and jumps into his lap. meanwhile, the assistant turns on a chugging, card shuffling univac computer, which spits out a length of tickertape.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{chakasandra singh, new delhi. snakebite.}
<A>__{death checks the name against the master list in his big ledger. he pulls out a document and puts his stamp on it the death warrant. this he gives to the reaper at the head of the line.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{mulrooney, lavinia p., dearborn, michigan. head crushed in a pants press.}
<A>__{as the line moves along, we notice an odd looking reaper nearing the desk. his gait is wobbly. his head bobs independently of the rest of his body. there's a big, luminescent stain on the front of his shroud.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{you!!!}
<A>__{everyone freezes as death points a bony finger directly at the wobbly reaper with the iridescent stain.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{you're the customer, okay? you're about to die. it's a big occasion. a formal occasion. and as you shuffle off this mortal coil, the last thing your eyes behold is a grim reaper covered with...}
<P>__{(sputtering)}
<D>__{what the hell is that??}
<A>__{two voices come out from under the shroud at once:}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{cranberry margarita.}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{sex on the beach.}
<A>__{much coughing and throat clearing from under the shroud. by now death's lapdog is growling at the stained reaper, and death can't hear what anyone is saying. he shushes the dog.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{...what??}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{salty dog.}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{sufferin' bastard.}
<A>__{the little hellhound yips viciously. death whacks him on the rump.}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{well whatever it is you get that shroud to the dry cleaner asap! now where were we?}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{clarke p. devereaux, san francisco. complications resulting from coma...}
<C>__{death}
<D>__{oh, wait. says here he's supposed to recover.}
<A>__{a loud chorus of "a wwwww's" from the disappointed reapers. death stamps the word "reprieve" on clarke's warrant. his assistant crosses the room. in the far wall is a steel reinforced vault door with a hydraulic wheel the kind you see at banks. the assistant dials in a combination, turns the wheel, laboriously pulls the door open and steps inside... ...returning, a moment later, with a priceless gold e ticket!! the upper half of the stained reaper begins to gyrate wildly. closeup on stu under the shroud monkeybone is doing an agitated tap dance on his head. his tail whips repeatedly across stu's face.}
