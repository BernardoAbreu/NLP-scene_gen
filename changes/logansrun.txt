<ACTION>__{Shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city of  great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains... multi-leveled  but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering clear tubes of the MAZE- CARS. CLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPS As a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop. ROOFTOP - THE RUNNER The hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runs swiftly  along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator which instantly  starts to descend.}

<ACTION>__{From a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a great  height.  As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out, pushes into  the crowd.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{OUT WITH THE RUNNER}
<ACTION>__{As he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes for a  kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the courtyard. He is  moving even faster now, glancing back as if he fears pursuit. ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR Above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and silver,   a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand -- and watching.  It is FRANCIS.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{WITH THE RUNNER}
<ACTION>__{Moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling the  presence above. He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his face breaks in  terror. He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the hall. THE SANDMAN (FRANCIS) Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{P.O.V.}
<ACTION>__{The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the pool.  People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and fearful.}

<ACTION>__{Emotionless. Aims. Fires. THE RUNNER - CLOSE Seeming to burst aflame in the LENS, then slipping BELOW FRAME to reveal  Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. The crowd closing in  behind him, applauding, congratulating him.}

<ACTION>__{Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a black  flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as the crowd   CHEERS and APPLAUDS him.}

<ACTION>__{The crystal is in the hand of a sleeping INFANT who is behind glass in  one of many cubicles. Standing outside, looking in, LOGAN, dimly lit in   the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant lies, swaddled and  coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which caters to the baby's every need.  Faint MUSIC bubbles like distant laughter.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{OUT LOGAN}
<ACTION>__{Logan is twenty-five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of austere grace. He is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nursery window  into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles THREE SLEEPING INFANTS. Logan is  KNOCKING on the soundless glass.}

We get only a glimpse as the maze-car disappears  into a tunnel. MAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADE As the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a gathering  CROWD. FULL SHOT - ARCADE Glittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some walking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna Park --  you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every delight -- too  much to take in at a glance.}

<CHAR>__{FRANCIS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, why no!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -You have a better idea?}
<CHAR>__{LOGAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(laughs)}
<DIAL>__{No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher With a stuck tape.}

<DIAL>__{Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat)}
<DIAL>__{You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman}
<ACTION>__{They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people to:  RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN! REFRESH AND  RENEW ANYTIME!! As they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly, falling  into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of the men stops  abruptly, almost colliding with them. He mumbles an apology and starts  back to RELIVE. As he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP, his friend shrugs cheerfully to  Logan and Francis and moves on. ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOU They are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comes cannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a pretty young  woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in front of  her with his hands framing his face.}

<ACTION>__{The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway. Logan  and Francis are swallowed up in the group. FULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALL An immense room into which the streams of people coming from the entertainment area are mingling. There is a general air of anticipation  stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and Francis entering,  waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them just as they reach a  beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see Francis. They embrace,  and as they break:}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(smiles)}
<DIAL>__{So do I...but if I don't at least I'll have the ultimate thrill. I'd almost rather have that than renew. 2ND WOMAN I feel the same way. Sometimes I think I'm not even going to try and renew when my time comes. But -- that's three years away. So long.}

<DIAL>__{But you can try.}
<ACTION>__{They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters, moving  with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them, almost knocking  Francis over. He reels, Logan catches him and they recover in time to see   the trio rip wildly through the crowd, knocking people down, screaming  with shrill joy as they disappear.}

The Mark III's laser heads are integrated into the whole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping. The machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray table on an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and Integral with it. From the cryonic receptor base there is a steady exhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurring the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers Which join in solid state circuitry so that any random or involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an equivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise. At one end -- where the halves of the Mark III join, is n console of switches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control the operation from the first injection of cold to the final healing vacuum drafts and scar burnishing. With the air of a magician demonstrating, Doc goes to the console and flips switches. Instantly the table responds -- the platform tilting, the crab-like laser arms descending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash harmlessly across the table.
