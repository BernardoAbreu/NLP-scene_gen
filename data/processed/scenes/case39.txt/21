<L>__{interior corridor day}
<A>__{emily watches in agony as the sheridan family steps into the elevator. parent on each side, lucy gives her one last pleading look then the elevator doors close and she's gone.}
<L>__{interior wayne's office day}
<A>__{emily and wayne in the heat of an argument.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{she doesn't trust anybody. you think i made it up?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i think you'd do just about anything you had to do to help a child you thought was at risk. here are the facts, emily. they haven't laid a finger on her that we can tell. and we have no proof they intend to. meanwhile on your desk right now are thirty plus cases of actionable abuse. what about those?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i'm not giving up on her, wayne.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{yes, you are, you're leaving this alone.}
<A>__{a look that says he means it.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i hope you can live with a dead child on your conscience.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{that's a little unfair, don't you think? i care about these kids as much as you do, but we can't go around yanking them out of their homes on a hunch. parents, even bad ones, have rights, that's how the laws of this great land are written.}
<A>__{emily gives a resigned nod, backing away from him, from the job, all of it.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{so that's it? we let kids get killed until they rewrite the goddamn laws?}
<A>__{she exits before he can answer, doesn't want to hear it.}
