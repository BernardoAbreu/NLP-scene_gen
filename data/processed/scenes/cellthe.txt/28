<L>__{interior riverside county sheriff's station day}
<A>__{in a briefing room we find teddy lee, ramsey, cole and local cops. all in need of caffeine. they complain, gossip, and shoot the shit. resembling a demanding professor, novak enters and through presence alone, lacking any self consciousness about his dishevelled appearance, takes control of the room by holding up a photograph of a young woman.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{donna krozin.}
<P>__{(a new picture every time)}
<D>__{helen francis, teresa manicki...}
<A>__{the chatter dies.}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{antoinette simms, natalie pagels, grace cassatt... anne vicksey.}
<A>__{every person is solemn and focused.}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{smart, gentle, attractive young women. just starting out in life. embarking on careers, going to school, getting married...}
<A>__{he's hooked them. the victims, these women, now mean something to them. with great effect, he holds up grisly post mortem photos.}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{they were killed. kidnapped, tortured, and murdered. by a white male. about 30 years old.}
<P>__{(significantly)}
<D>__{who owns an albino dog. }
<A>__{everyone knows this is a real clue and awareness is heightened. ramsey chimes in.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{a purebred german shepherd.}
<A>__{novak shows them a picture of a white german shepherd taken from a resource on the internet.}
<C>__{ramsey }
<D>__{breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{nicole labetzki. victim seven. forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a k 9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.}
<C>__{teddy lee}
<D>__{the phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago. and we got the match.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{it's his dog.}
<A>__{ramsey holds up a thick list.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{registered breeders of german shepherds.}
<A>__{the list is long and a few of the cops groan. novak silences them with a fierce look that says, "i will not rest until this man is found and neither should you."}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{be thorough, but be fast. this guy's accelerating. he only waited six days this last time. when he started, two months could pass.}
<A>__{a desk seargent enters the room and hands a fax to ramsey. novak is curious about it, but continues.}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{this can mean different things. he thinks we're stupid and can't catch him. he's having fun and needs more. or...}
<P>__{(thinking it through)}
<D>__{this dog hair thing is sloppy. the body this morning was found in less than three inches of water. he knew we'd find her. he wants to be caught. but if we can't stop him...}
<A>__{gravely concerned, ramsey moves across the room.}
<C>__{novak }
<P>__{(dreading what's on that fax)}
<D>__{...he can't stop himself.}
