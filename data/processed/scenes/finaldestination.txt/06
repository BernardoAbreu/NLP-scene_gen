<D>__{i will. don't worry.}
<A>__{the group begins down the airport toward the check in counter. in the f.g., before the boys, strides a girl, clear rivers, 17, reading the tropic of cancer. the loner in the group, clear wears dark colors against the insecerity of her sex appeal. she appears aloof and more wordly then the other students. readying his ticket and documents, tod flips open his passport, checking out his photo.}
