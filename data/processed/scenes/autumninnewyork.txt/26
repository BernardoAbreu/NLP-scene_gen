<A>__{the furniture is antique and dark. the white walls are tinged with yellow from years of cigarettes. in one corner, the paint has chipped off the ceiling in a jagged plate. dolores sits on a worn out leather arm chair, smoking, sipping a cocktail, watching a daytime talk show. in the background, we see charlotte working in the adjoining dining room which she has turned into a lovely sewing room. closer on charlotte. she builds her hat on a hat block a wooden mannequin head. strewn all around her are the materials of her hatmaking bolts of cloth, hat blocks, a sewing table. shannon, wearing sweats and a t shirt, lies on the floor, eating m+m's and drinking diet soda, while heavily marking up a text book with a yellow highlighter. charlotte stops and rubs her eyes, then she glances down at shannon and smiles }

<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{that you're the most beautiful person in the entire world.}
