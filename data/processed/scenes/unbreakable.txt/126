<D>__{my turn.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?}
<A>__{david's grin slowly fades.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{that's not the game.}
<A>__{megan moves her stool closer. they're only a foot or so apart.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{it's a second date. there aren't any rules.}
<A>__{beat. david sips his drink slowly.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm not sure.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{think carefully?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what about the game?}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{it's finished. i won.}
<A>__{beat. david glances at megan. she waits for his answer.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it }
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i had a nightmare one night and i didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think that was the first time.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{does that count?}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{that counts.}
<A>__{beat. megan takes her glass up to her lips. doesn't take a sip. brings it back down.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{do you knowingly keep jeremy and me at a distance?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{megan's face tenses. she's on the verge of getting upset.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i don't know megan.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{it's like you resent us david. resent the life you have.}
<A>__{beat. david doesn't answer.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{you know even if it meant we couldn't be together, i would never have wished that injury on you? what you could so physically was a gift. i would never have wished it to go away.}
<A>__{megan's eyes glaze with water. beat.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{you know that right?}
<A>__{david takes a sip with a trembling hand. david's eyes look up and make eye contact with megan's. he stares at her for the longest time.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{husband and wife sit close together in the corner of the bar on their second date.}
