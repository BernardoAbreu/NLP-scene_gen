<L>__{exterior dupea grounds day}
<A>__{bobby and carl, playing a game of table tennis. tita stands leaning against a tree, watching them. in the b.g., spicer can be seen, meticulously oiling and cleaning the wheelchair. as they volley the ball back and forth:}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you sure you should be playing, carl?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what do you mean? aside from my neck, i'm in superb shape.}
<A>__{carl hits into the net, and as the ball rebounds to him, he tosses it to bobby.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(serving)}
<D>__{i don't know, there's something wrong with the way you move.}
<A>__{carl hits the net again.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i'm not aware of it. like what?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{your serve. two eighteen.}
<A>__{carl serves and as they volley:}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{i'd hate to see you walk across a concert stage like that.}
<A>__{carl tries a smash and mis hits the ball...}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{two nineteen.}
<A>__{... and as he retrieves it:}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(irritated with bobby)}
<D>__{i've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that's what i mean...}
<A>__{carl comes back to the table.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{any particular humor, i meant.}
<A>__{he angrily serves the ball.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(returning)}
<D>__{i think you should get someone to coach you how to walk. i think it's a substantial problem.}
<A>__{he hits a smash and it sails past carl into some shrubbery several yards away.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{dammit!}
<A>__{as he moves after the ball, bobby gestures at him.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{look at that.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{why are you being so mean?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm not. he does walk funny. don't you see that?}
<A>__{she looks at carl, bent over and searching through the shrubs.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{i don't think i'd notice. i'm so used to carl.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(wanting to go on about it)}
<D>__{yeah, well, he's...}
<A>__{she interrupts him, looking toward spicer.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{bobby? do you think spicer is attractive?}
<A>__{he looks over at spicer, polishing the frame of the wheelchair.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i think he's got a terrific personality.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{you know, he was formerly a sailor.}
<A>__{bobby gestures his paddle at carl, on his way back with the ball.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{look, can't you see that, what i'm talking about?}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{sailors are sadistic, i feel.}
<A>__{carl comes up to the table, asserting:}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{see? there's nothing wrong with the way i walk. now where are we?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{at game, carl.}
<A>__{carl serves and they volley briefly. then bobby angles the ball sharply and puts it away.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{that's three games to none, carl.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{all right, let's have a rematch.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i thought you had to go to the mainland today. aren't you going to miss the ferry?}
<A>__{carl takes a quick glance at his watch, then drops his paddle onto the table.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{too bad. just when i was hitting my stride.}
<A>__{he starts away, then turns back.}
<C>__{carl }
<D>__{say goodbye to catherine for me, will you?}
<A>__{as he moves off in the direction of the cars, tita comes up beside bobby.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{can i play now?}
<A>__{carl calls over to them from his car:}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{tell her i will be back sometime tomorrow!}
<A>__{bobby turns to tita.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{where is she, anyway?}
<C>__{tita}
<P>__{(ignoring the question)}
<D>__{my turn.}
<A>__{he hands her the paddle...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{why don't you and spicer play?}
<A>__{... and moves off toward the house.}
