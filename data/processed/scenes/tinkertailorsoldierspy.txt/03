<L>__{exterior subway exit day}
<A>__{shooting up the steps of the exit to the imposing galeria building on the corner ahead. prideaux and the magyar walk up the steps, still paying no attention to each other, and head towards...}
<L>__{interior budapest galeria day}
<A>__{a formerly grand arcade. many of the shops are now closed, the one's that are open don't have much to sell. a cafe occupies the middle space under the high vaulted ceiling. a jazz rock band rehearses in one of the nearby disused shops, incongruous in the window, music muffled by the glass. customers sit around tables playing chess, drinking coffee, a mother breast feeding, the hum of chatter. the ordinary world. we find prideaux and the magyar sitting at one of the tables.}
<C>__{magyar}
<P>__{(hungarian, subtitled)}
<D>__{and porkolts. you know porkolts?}
<C>__{jim prideaux}
<P>__{(hungarian, subtitled)}
<D>__{yes, i've had it.}
<C>__{magyar}
<D>__{it's very good. better than goulash. but you won't get it in budapest now.}
<C>__{jim prideaux}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{magyar}
<D>__{all the pigs have gone to moscow.}
<A>__{he gives a sly laugh. prideaux smiles, draws on his cigarette, nonchalantly examining the people at the tables around them. a waiter arrives, belly bulging out of his grubby shirt, hair plastered to his head. he puts two wizened looking sandwiches in front of them. prideaux's p.o.v. a drop of sweat trickles from the waiter's face, drips onto the table top. the magyar catches jim looking at the droplet and gives a wry smile "nice service." jim smiles back but a bell has begun to ring inside him.}
<C>__{jim prideaux}
<D>__{when do i get to meet your friend?}
<A>__{the magyar chews on his sandwich, notices prideaux is ignoring his.}
<C>__{magyar}
<D>__{i will take you to him. not eating?}
<A>__{prideaux pushes his sandwich across the table, his manner still easy, but his eyes flick after the waiter, who stands at the entrance to the coffee shop, arguing with another man. he looks around the galeria again, looking low checking the feet of the other customers? then raising his gaze, he checks the windows of the apartments above which look down into the arcade. prideaux's p.o.v. an old woman stands in the shadows by a window above. she is watching him. catching his gaze she shrinks back into the darkness and disappears. prideaux's expression doesn't change but he sets his coffee cup down and casually stands. the magyar looks up in surprise.}
<C>__{jim prideaux}
<D>__{would you excuse me a moment?}
<A>__{he starts to walk towards the exit of the galeria. behind him his chair teeters for a moment, then slowly falls back and lands with a crash, sending pigeons fluttering up to the domed ceiling. the waiter starts, turns, sees prideaux leaving. panic flashes across his face, he draws a gun from the back of his belt, aims after prideaux and fires the shot echoing in the cavernous space. the shot misses, ricocheting off the tiled wall and prideaux keeps walking, fighting down the impulse to run, as behind him, out of focus an image from a surreal nightmare: the other customers stop what they are doing, like actors at the end of a scene, and begin to rise, some drawing guns. we hear a muffled voice shouting distantly in russian.}
<C>__{kgb man}
<D>__{no firing!}
<A>__{ahead of prideaux more figures appear, blocking the exit. he looks over his shoulder just as another shot rings out this one catching him above the shoulder blade and sending him flying out of frame. from around a corner a tall, over coated man kgb strides towards the scene, still bellowing in russian.}
<C>__{kgb man }
<D>__{who told you to fire? who told you to fucking fire?}
<A>__{the jazz band have stopped playing and are staring at the ground, arms at their sides, anxious not to see anything. in the top window the old woman slips back into sight. her p.o.v. prideaux lies face down in the arcade below. as we watch one of his arms slides out, leaving a slick of blood. then he's still. below the kgb man has grabbed the waiter and started to beat him.}
<C>__{kgb man }
<D>__{fucking hungarian amateur! we wanted him alive!}
<A>__{behind him we can see the breast feeding mother. she's dead, a bullet hole in the centre of her forehead from the ricochet. the baby continues to suckle on, undisturbed. through the cafe window we can see a man, partly obscured by the crowd in front of us, the only man still seated. he lights a cigarette. close on the lighter as he replaces it. we can make out an inscription: "to george, from ann. all my love." in the galeria the kgb man continues to bellow at the waiter. the baby begins to wail.}
