<L>__{exterior hillside day}
<A>__{hector and beatrice have stopped to eat. they shelter in the fold of a hillside, with a wide stream running some way below. hector feeds beatrice a piece of cheese from his knife.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{hurry up and finish your wine and then we can make love.}
<A>__{hector seems to know what she is saying. he throws down his knife and cheese, lying down with her on the grass. he kisses her breasts and her body eagerly. he lifts her skirts and caresses and kisses her naked legs and thighs. she stretches herself out happily, arms spread wide on the grass. hector talks through his kisses.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{why do you smell so wonderful?}
<A>__{he lifts his head to let her see him sniffing.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{oh, you like my smell, do you? i make it from the flowers. i put it here, and there, and there.}
<A>__{hector kisses her more. she smiles and turns her head to the sky. then she starts to giggle.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{i don't believe it... someone's watching us, the dirty devil... don't look... he's down by the water, by the rocks...}
<A>__{hector doesn't understand, and keeps on with his kissing. only her persistent giggling makes him stop and look up. hector sees him too. down by the stream a head peering over the top of a rock, not even attempting to hide.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{cheeky devil.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{he's not moving. he must've seen us, though.}
<A>__{she sits up and straightens her clothing, suddenly anxious.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{don't look at him anymore. let's go... down the other side of the hill.}
<A>__{but hector still looks at the figure in the distance. there is an uneasy silence while hector works it out. then he speaks.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{it's a dead man.}
<A>__{beatrice doesn't understand. hector stands up, still looking at the figure.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{come on, we're going that way at any rate.}
<A>__{they move cautiously. when they are closer to it, and can see it for what is is, they walk straight for the dead body.}
