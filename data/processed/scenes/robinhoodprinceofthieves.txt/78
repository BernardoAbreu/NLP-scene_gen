<L>__{exterior country lane day}
<A>__{distant thunder. three horses. first wulf's, leading another with the bodies of bull and sarah draped across its back. aslan rides the third, with robin propped up in front of him.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you have fulfilled your vow. now you can leave.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{your gratitude warms my heart.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you ignored my request.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{it is fortunate that i did.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{because of you, another good man is dead.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{he urged me to bring him. he was a brave man and i grieve for him. praise be to allah that i do not grieve for you also. or for my broken vow.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{to hell with your damn vow.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{i am glad you are feeling better.}
<A>__{ahead of them, wulf shouts and reins in. he points into the distance. a huge cloud of smoke is darkening the sky.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{the forest! ride!}
