<L>__{exterior condo beach day}
<A>__{the wooden deck hangs off the back of the beach condo. a picnic table is set with plastic place mats and forks. wind lifts the corner of a stack of napkins. the wind blows harder, fanning the napkins off the table. on the beach, curtis, still working in the sand, puts a top on the sand castle.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{good. we put a top on it.}
<A>__{curtis smooths out the sand in the castle shaped bucket and turns it over to top off their sand mound. he hands the bucket over for hannah to refill. the sound of the waves behind them has stopped. they don't notice. curtis takes two fingers and digs a small trench around the sand castle. curtis looks up ready to sign the letters but sees hannah staring at the water. she looks at him and signs something with her hands.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{what is it honey?}
<A>__{curtis misses it. he shakes his head, "no", and hannah signs again, slowly: "s t o r m".}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{curtis turns to the shoreline, getting to his feet. he looks down at hannah, who watches, mesmerized. scared, she looks to her father. he grabs her under the arms and rests her on his hip. she buries her head into his chest. at the condo, a gust of wind greets samantha as she walks out onto the deck holding a plate of hotdogs and a bowl of chili. she stops, seeing the horizon. her mouth falls open. she slowly sets the plate and bowl down on the table, her mind racing. she looks down at curtis in disbelief. curtis looks up to the condo and makes eye contact. he studies her face. samantha looks at her husband, trying to process it all. she looks out at the horizon then back down to curtis. concern on her face, she nods to him. curtis sees her nod. samantha's eyes, still locked on curtis, soften, as if to apologize. after a moment, she mouths to him, "i love you." curtis nods back to her. she looks back up to the shoreline. on the beach, curtis' feet kick up sand as he rushes back toward the condo. at the condo, samantha hasn't moved from the porch. a light rain begins to fall. her hands grip the railing. she turns her left palm up. dark rain collects there. on the horizon in front of her, the water has receded into the gulf some 100 yards. the dark}
<B>__{sandy bottom looks odd stretched out so far. a storm cell sits massed on the horizon. churning black clouds filled with layers of horizontal lightning.}
<A>__{behind samantha, curtis appears in the open sliding door clutching hannah. the storm cell is reflected in the glass next to him.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{sam.}
<A>__{samantha looks down at her palm. she rubs the thick, viscous rain in her fingers. she looks back up at the storm. on samantha's face,}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{the end.}
