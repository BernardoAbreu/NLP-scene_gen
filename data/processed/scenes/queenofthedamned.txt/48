<L>__{exterior beach night}
<A>__{a million stars...}
<C>__{lestat }
<D>__{i impressed my maker with my thirst for things. he set out to educate me in the unknown. taught me all about the world, its hidden history... and about myself.}
<A>__{tilt down to reveal an old fisherman who cries out as lestat bites into his throat. marius watches as the fisherman's body relaxes. he pulls lestat away.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{that's enough, my son... when you feed, you must hold back from the moment of death. you must never take the last drop, or it will draw you in and you will die...}
<A>__{the fisherman is moaning. looking down at the suffering victim, marius swiftly snaps his neck and dumps him into a boat. he picks up an oar, and with vampire strength, drives it like a stake through the bottom of the boat. water starts bubbling in.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{remember, there is wisdom in the flesh, lestat. a man wears his history on his skin...}
<A>__{marius feels lestat's gaze, turns to him.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{i'm talking about humanity.}
<A>__{as lestat watches the water begin to fill the bottom of the boat...}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{humanity?}
<P>__{(snort)}
<D>__{we're murderers.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{we're more than that. their blood that we take into us carries with it life... their life, their knowledge, their complexity. appreciate your prey, lestat.}
<A>__{marius gazes at the fisherman, then, with vampire strength, shoves the boat far out into the ocean.}
