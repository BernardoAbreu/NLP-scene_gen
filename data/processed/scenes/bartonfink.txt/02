<T>__{fade out:}
<B>__{executive office}
<A>__{barton fink is ushered into a large, light office by an obsequious middle aged man in a sagging suit. there are mosquito bites on barton's face.}
<B>__{reverse}
<A>__{from behind a huge white desk, a burly man in an expensive suit gets to his feet and strides across the room.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{is that him?! barton fink?! lemme put my arms around this guy!}
<A>__{he bear hugs barton.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{...how the hell are ya? good trip?}
<A>__{he separates without waiting for an answer.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{my name is jack lipnik. i run this dump. you know that you read the papers.}
<A>__{lipnik is lumbering back to his desk.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{lou treating you all right? got everything you need? what the hell's the matter with your face? what the hell's the matter with his face, lou?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{it's not as bad as it looks; just a mosquito in my room}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{place okay?}
<A>__{to lou:}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{...where did we put him?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i'm at the earle.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{never heard of it. let's move him to the grand, or the wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{thanks, but i wanted a place that was less...}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{less hollywood? sure, say it, it's not a dirty word. sat whatever the hell you want. the writer is king here at capitol pictures. you don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week that's what we think of the writer.}
<P>__{(to lou)}
<D>__{...so what kind of pictures does he like?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{mr. fink hasn't given a preference, mr. lipnik.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{how's about it, bart?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{to be honest, i don't go to the pictures much, mr. lipnik}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{that's okay, that's okay, that's okay that's just fine. you probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo jumbo to learn. you were dead wrong. we're only interested in one thing: can you tell a story, bart? can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? is that more than one thing? okay. the point is, i run this dump and i don't know the technical mumbo jumbo. why do i run it? i've got horse sense, goddamnit. showmanship. and also, and i hope lou told you this, i bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. did you tell him that, lou? and i don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. coffee?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...yes, thank you.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{lou.}
<A>__{lou immediately rises and leaves. lipnik's tone becomes confidential:}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{...he used to have shares in the company. an ownership interest. got bought out in the twenties muscled out according to some. hell, according to me. so we keep him around, he's got a family. poor schmuck. he's sensitive, don't mention the old days. oh hell, say whatever you want. look, barring a preference, bart, we're gonna put you to work on a wrestling picture. wallace beery. i say this because they tell me you know the poetry of the street. that would rule out westerns, pirate pictures, screwball, bible, roman...}
<A>__{he rises and starts pacing.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{but look, i'm not one of these guys thinks poetic has gotta be fruity. we're together on that, aren't we? i mean i'm from new york myself well, minsk if you wanna go way back, which we won't if you don't mind and i ain't askin'. now people're gonna tell you, wrestling. wallace beery, it's a b picture. you tell them, bullshit. we don't make b pictures here at capitol. let's put a stop to that rumor right now.}
<A>__{lou enters with coffee.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{...thanks lou. join us. join us. talking about the wallace beery picture.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{excellent picture.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{we got a treatment on it yet?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{no, not yet jack. we just bought the story. saturday evening post.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{okay, the hell with the story. wallace beery is a wrestler. i wanna know his hopes, his dreams. naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. and a romantic interest. you know the drill. romantic interest, or else a young kid. an orphan. what do you think, lou? wally a little too old for a romantic interest? look at me, a writer in the room and i'm askin' lou what the goddamn story should be!}
<A>__{after a robust laugh, he beams at barton.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{...well bart, which is it? orphan? dame?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...both maybe?}
<A>__{there is a disappointed silence. lipnik looks at lou. lou clears his throat.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{...maybe we should do a treatment.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{ah, hell, let bart take a crack at it. he'll get into the swing of things or i don't know writers. let's make it a dame, bart, keep it simple. we don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. the important thing is we all have that barton fink feeling, but since you're barton fink i'm assuming you have it in spades. seriously bart, i like you. we're off to a good start. dammit, if all our writers were like you i wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. i'd like to see something by the end of the week.}
<A>__{lou is getting to his feet and signaling for barton to do likewise.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{...heard about your show, by the way. my man in new york saw it. tells me it was pretty damn powerful. pretty damn moving. a little fruity, he said, but i guess you know what you're doing. thank you for your heart. we need more heart in pictures. we're all expecting great things.}
<B>__{tracking shot}
<A>__{we are in the sixth floor hallway of the earle, late at night. a pair of shoes sits before each door. faintly, from one of the rooms, we can hear the clack. clack. clack. of a typewriter. it grows louder as we track forward.}
