<A>__{same "boundary construction" here. kale shoves a screwdriver into the ground a few feet shy of his mailbox. he ties some string to it as he glances over to the other neighbors' (the pilch's) yard, sees their black labra doodle watching him.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{hey doggie, come here...}
<A>__{the dog trots toward kale. it almost reaches his outstretched hand when it suddenly gets zapped by the underground electric fence. it yelps away. spins back around, sits and stares.}
<C>__{kale }
<P>__{(re: his ankle bracelet)}
<D>__{hey, you and me both.}
<A>__{over kale's shoulder in the b.g. ashley lifts more boxes from the back of their station wagon. she sets them on the drive, slams the liftgate. kale turns around. ashley throws him a quick glance, then heads around the back of her house. kale stares after her.}
