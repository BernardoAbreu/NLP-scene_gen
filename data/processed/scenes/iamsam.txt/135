<L>__{interior sam's apartment continuous}
<A>__{rita bursts through the door and then stops. sam has created an origami wall of newspapers, intricately woven together. a fortress against the world. he keeps folding doesn't even look at rita. he's more far gone than she could imagine, she walks gingerly to the wall and knocks gently on it.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{sam, it's rita. can i come in?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no room. no room.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{hey. i lived in the east village. i don't need a lot of room.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sam makes life too hard. sam makes life too hard on everyone.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{sam, i can go at least nine more rounds. but you gotta let me in. please sam. please.}
<A>__{he pulls out one small brick of origami, opening a window.}
<C>__{rita }
<D>__{thank you. now i can see your kind eyes...george told me you needed a break from work.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't want to work there anymore. too many people.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{maybe we could find you a quieter job. because remember one of the judges conditions is you have to earn more money; you've got to keep earning more money for when we get you lucy back.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{lucy doesn't need me anymore. she has a new family. she doesn't need me anymore.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{is that what she said?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{she didn't have to say it. i may be stupid, but i know. i know.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{well that's the first stupid thing i've ever heard you say.}
<A>__{sam looks at her through the window. a chink in the wall.}
<C>__{rita }
<D>__{sam, sam you can get her back. the court favors reunification. the only thing that can block you is if the foster family petitions to adopt. and from what i've heard, lucy's making their life miserable that's our girl. sam, fight for her.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i tried. i tried.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{try harder.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you don't know. you don't know.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i don't know?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you don't know what it is to try and try and never get there. you were born perfect, perfect.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{is that right? everyone else is perfect but only sam feels loss and pain?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that's right. people like you don't know.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{people like me?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{people like you don't know, don't know what hurt feels like, people like you don't feel, don't feel anything.}
<A>__{she slaps him. stunned, he slaps her back. stunned, she slaps him again. he slaps her. she rips the newspaper wall down.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{you think you got the market cornered on human suffering? well let me tell you something about "people like me." people like me feel little and lost and ugly and dispensable. people like me have perfect husbands screwing someone far more perfect than me and my son, my son hates me, i try too hard and i push and he knows it and i talk in that voice, that voice i promised i'd never use, and i've screamed, i've screamed horrible things to him, a five year old because he doesn't want to get in the car at the end of a day and he stares at me with such anger and i hate him then. i know i'm failing you, i know i'm disappointing you, i know you deserve better but get in the fucking car! it's like every morning i wake up and fail, and i look around and anybody, anybody can pull it off, but somehow i can't. and i know, i know i have everything, and i'm still miserable and it's pathetic. i know it's pathetic. no matter how hard i try, something about me will never be enough.}
<A>__{she's crying too hard to continue. he pulls her to him. before she realizes what's happening, she's holding him tightly. he whispers in her ear.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you're enough. you're so much more than enough.}
<A>__{he looks her straight in the eye she's undone by the intimacy of the moment, by the strength of his purity. and staring into his eyes, she begins to sob, walls crumbling. he kisses her elbow, her shoulder, her forehead, her eyes, her tears. and something ignites between them something confused and scary and deep and filled with a passionate ache.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{lovely rita...}
<A>__{on a bed of newspaper that was once a wall they come together, whole again.}
