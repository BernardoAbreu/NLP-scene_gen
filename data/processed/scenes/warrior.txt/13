<D>__{this is the new appraisal figure, and this is how it effects the monthly. as you can see, that puts you upside down on your mortgage. that's the problem. it's the country that did the assessment, not the bank. so, the numbers are what they are, mr. conlon.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{brendan.}
<C>__{dan taylor}
<D>__{the numbers are what they are, brendan. i mean, you're a math teacher, you can appreciate that.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i teach physics.}
<C>__{dan taylor}
<D>__{physics. ok. but the bank has got to go by the new appraisal figures. according to these figures, you're upside down on your mortgage }
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you said that three times already. i get that. but i'm asking you if there's something else you can do. not the bank, you. can you shift things around, restructure }
<C>__{dan taylor}
<D>__{well, you've already refinanced twice.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{because you advised us to do that.}
<C>__{dan taylor}
<D>__{i presented you with that option. it was your choice.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm also showing you netted a substantial payout with the refi.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{we had that conversation. i was paying medical bills. is that in your file?}
<A>__{taylor looks at brendan. takes him a second to remember.}
<C>__{dan taylor}
<D>__{oh, right. sorry. your daughter's...kidney?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{heart.}
<C>__{dan taylor}
<D>__{heart, right.}
<P>__{(off stack of files on desk)}
<D>__{lot of stories.}
<A>__{brendan glares at him.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{so my option is i've got no options? you're not even gonna try to help me?}
<C>__{dan taylor}
<D>__{i am trying, brendan. look, i can get you 90 days to get even }
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{90 days is not enough. my wife and i have three jobs between us and that doesn't cut it. so, what do you suggest?}
<C>__{dan taylor}
<D>__{let me ask you a question: have you considered bankruptcy? it's a viable option. there's no shame in it these days.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{that's not how i do things.}
<C>__{dan taylor}
<D>__{well, then you're looking at foreclosure.}
<A>__{brendan gets up and storms out of the office.}
