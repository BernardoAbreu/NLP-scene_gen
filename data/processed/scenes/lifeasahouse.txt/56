<L>__{interior robin's kitchen evening}
<A>__{robin is sitting alone at the table, doing nothing. the tv is on loud in another room. adam walks into the room in his pajamas. he sits down across from his mother at the table. robin smiles at him. he smiles back as he scoots his chair closer to the table and extends his arms straight out across the top. robin extends her arms and they lock hands near the middle. without a word, they hold hands. adam lets go and climbs on top of the table, scoots across it with a kiss for his mother before he's gone, sliding off the table on his rear and running back to the tv.}
