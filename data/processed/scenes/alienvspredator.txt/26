<A>__{as lex and miller emerge from the mess hall, they see sebastian. he's flushed and excited.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{over here! you're not going to believe this!}
<A>__{he leads them around the corner of the mess hall to reveal a gaping hole in the snow and ice. perfectly round. ten feet across. sebastian and the rest of the team are gathering around the hole. off to one side is quinn's drilling equipment it's not even unpacked.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{it's drilled at a perfect 30 degree angle.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{how far does it go down?}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{all the way to the pyramid.}
<A>__{quinn nods to sven and he lights a flare, then drops it down the shaft. the flare falls... endlessly until its flickering light is finally swallowed in the darkness. it never hits bottom.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{how was it done?}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{thermal equipment of some kind.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{like yours?}
<A>__{quinn shakes his head. he glances at the building closest to the hole. whatever cut through the ice has also cut clean through the building, vaporizing wooden beams and metal walls.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{more advanced. incredibly powerful. i've never seen anything like it.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{i told you i wasn't the only one with a satellite. it must be another team. maybe the chinese ...the russians. whoever it is, they clearly have better equipment than we do.}
<C>__{quinn}
<P>__{(to weyland)}
<D>__{listen, whoever cut this, sliced through pack ice, the building, the beams and solid metal walls. we should find out what cut this before we proceed.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i thought you were the best?}
<A>__{quinn bristles. he doesn't like criticism.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{i am the best.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{it doesn't make any sense. where's their base camp?}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{she's right.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{they must already be down there.}
<A>__{lex examines the ice at the mouth of the hole.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{no. look at the ice. there's no ridges. nobody's been down there.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{satellite passed over eleven minutes ago. get me the data.}
<A>__{max moves off to do that.}
