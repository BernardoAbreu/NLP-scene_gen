<D>__{he i.d.'d the assailant. the description matches you pretty well.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. probably not too many men fit that bill.}
<C>__{lucas}
<D>__{just give me a straight answer, walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.}

<A>__{walter is silent.}
<C>__{lucas }
<D>__{however, we ran an i.d. on the victim. turns out he's wanted in pennsylvania. he raped a boy there.}
