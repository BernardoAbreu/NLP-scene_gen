<C>__{gordon }
<P>__{(speaking with great difficulty)}
<D>__{'my dear wife. i am still in these conditions... worse... and too much pain. they don't want to believe me. you must try to help me. they won't stop. you must care for the children. i don't know anymore if i will come home alive. they're very }

<P>__{(to julius)}
<D>__{you as a lawyer will understand.}
<C>__{emily }
<D>__{we intend starting a civil suit against the police, to do that it is necessary to have as many affidavits as we can from people who have any information about gordon since he was arrested. and this man is vital and so is the indian doctor.}
