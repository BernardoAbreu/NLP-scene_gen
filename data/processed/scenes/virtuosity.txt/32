<B>__{inside the upscale nightclub}
<A>__{sid 6.7 gently caresses the hair of a terrified young woman sitting among several others. you hear the sound of tires screeching to a halt outside. sid 6.7 remains unconcerned. he toys with the woman, pointing the gun in her face, then pulling it back. her expression changes instantly. dramatically.}

<D>__{i just love how responsive you are.}
<C>__{cop l }
<D>__{freeze!}
<A>__{two cops stand in the doorway, weapons aimed at sid 6.7. the cops inch closer to him.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<P>__{(not turning around)}
<D>__{the ushers were not supposed to seat you until intermission. cop #1 put the gun down, nice and...}
<A>__{sid 6.7 spins around and fires twice before he can finish his sentence. both cops receive identical wounds in their shooting arms, reminding you of the wounds parker and john first received in the opening virtual reality sequence. sid 6.7 takes a bow, as if on stage.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you've been a real pleasure...}
<A>__{as he walks toward the exit, he admires himself in the mirror behind the bar. sid 6.7 has never seen his own image in the real world before. he likes what he sees.}
<B>__{outside the upscale nightclub}
<A>__{street traffic is much lighter here. sid 6.7 exits, getting into the vacant police car left by the cops. inside the cops' vehicle sid 6.7 adjusts his seat. the rearview mirror. glancing at himself. then behind him. his pov in the rearview mirror parker becomes visible racing around the corner. running like a dog who's got the scent. inside the cops' vehicle sid 6.7 looks pleased.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{well, look who it...}
<A>__{crack! a bullet spiderwebs the rear window. sid 6.7 punches the gas, taking off in a hurry.}
<B>__{outside the upscale nightclub}
<A>__{parker races after sid 6.7, firing his weapon continuously. without care for the innocent motorists nearby. they scream in absolute terror, but remain unharmed. physically, anyway. parker gives up the chase of sid 6.7's vehicle and runs in the other direction. toward madison as she rounds the corner in their squad car. inside parker's vehicle he opens the driver's side door and shoves madison over.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{what the hell's going on?!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{this is my area of expertise.}
<A>__{he jumps behind the wheel, flooring the accelerator. speeding through the already frightened motorists. madison is pinned to the back of her seat. looking out the window, she looks at the motorists.}
<C>__{madison}
<P>__{(with concern)}
<D>__{what did you do to those people?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{nothing.}
<B>__{on the street}
<A>__{parker's vehicle speeds through city streets. gaining ground on sid 6.7. parker stops for nothing. not for red lights. not for gridlock. when the street becomes impassable, he veers onto the sidewalk. inside parker's vehicle parker's eyes are locked to the road with fierce determination. madison's eyes are a mixture of fear and excitement. she holds onto the door handle for dear life.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?}

<D>__{you know i am.}

<P>__{(in disbelief)}
<D>__{that who i think it is?}
<A>__{parker turns to her, then picks up the radio.}
