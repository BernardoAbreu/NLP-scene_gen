<L>__{ext sid's bail bonds jersey city morning}
<A>__{swearing under his breath, sid is trying to stuff a xmas tree into the back of a station wagon. at least half of the tree is hanging out of the back. milo drinks a beer and watches.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{you gonna give me a hand, or just stand there killing your liver?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{is that a trick question?}
<A>__{sid glares at him. milo sighs, puts down his beer, and grabs part of the tree.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{so i told her, fine, i'd handle xmas this year. i mean, what's to handle? you buy a tree, some gifts, cook a ham, hang some lights. an idiot could do it.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{well, we'll soon find out.}
<A>__{sid checks him out.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{you have plans for the holiday?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{the usual.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{gonna drink some cheap whiskey and put your fist through a wall?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{jealous?}
<A>__{the tree is definitely not going to fit. they let it go, and sid pulls out a small hand saw.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{then forget it.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{forget what?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i've got an open bond, but your thing sounds like more fun. i will give it to doug instead.}
<A>__{sid starts hacking away at the tree.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{whoa. hold up, heidi. what the fuck. i want the job, i'm in the hole.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{you're always in the hole.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{what's your point?}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{the truth is, i'm not sure you're the right person for this job. it could be a total disaster. on the other hand, when one friend sees another friend stagnating in his own filth, he has to do something, right?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{hey. i just woke up. i was gonna shower.}
<A>__{sid drops the saw. with one final shove, the tree is in. phew. sid slams the back shut.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{ok. but remember: you asked for it.}
<A>__{he reaches into his pocket and extracts a folded piece of paper. hands it to milo. milo unfolds it, gives it a quick look. a second look. a third.}
<B>__{time stops. the whole street goes silent.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{are we done yet?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{is this a joke? because if it is, i'm gonna have to kill you.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{it's not a joke.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{she got arrested? and then she jumped bail?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{apparently the whole thing started with some reckless driving, and ended with her assaulting a police officer.}
<A>__{milo gives him a questioning look.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(explaining)}
<D>__{she bit him.}
<A>__{milo snorts.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{yeah. that sounds like her. but here's my question: why the hell did you post her bail?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{hey, i know she dumped you...}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{whoa. she did not "dump me".}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{ok, whatever, i...}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{no, not "whatever". i dumped her.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{the point is, i'm aware you guys have issues, but i'm running a business here. a person needs bail, i don't have time to check with you first.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{well, had you checked with me first, you wouldn't be out of a bond right now.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i'm not out of a bond if you go pick her up. it's five grand to bring her back by 9am, xmas day.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{you're telling me it's five grand to go pick up my ex wife and bring her to jail. (beat) on xmas.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{you're a good listener.}
<A>__{milo takes a deep, calming breath. then he explodes into whoops and hollers. he throws himself into a snow bank and thrashes around. he does a fred astaire around a lamp post.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i take it you're interested.}
<A>__{milo grabs sid and pulls him into a crushing bear hug.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i love you! you're the best friend a guy could ever have!}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{ok, take it easy...}
<A>__{teresa (mid 40's, overly made up, popping gum) pokes her head out the front door:}
<C>__{teresa}
<D>__{sid, you got a dui on line one.}
<P>__{(off their looks) what's going on?}
<A>__{milo drops sid, grabs teresa, and gives her a long, intense kiss. he releases her. she stumbles back a bit.}
<C>__{teresa}
<D>__{ok. (beat) can i have my gum back?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{right. sorry.}
<A>__{he reaches into his mouth, extracts her gum and hands it to her. she retreats back inside. milo beams at sid.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{you know what this is, don't you? karma! payback! you know how they say "what goes around comes around"? turns out it's true!}
<C>__{milo }
<P>__{(checking the paper) that middle}
<D>__{initial stands for rhonda, by the way. she tells people it stands for "rachel", but that's a lie.}
<A>__{sid shakes his head.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i can't believe you guys broke up over a stupid article.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{we didn't break up over a stupid article. we broke up because she is a cheating, manipulative liar.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{are you sure you can handle this?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{why wouldn't i be able to handle this?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{let's face it: you're not exactly rational around her. i mean, if i was a cop working a case and some reporter came snooping around, i'd say "no comment". not "no comment, but care for a cocktail"? and then a month later, running off to some love shack called "caveman's cabin" and tying the knot? who does that?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{that's not even close to what happened. for one thing, it was called "cupid's cabin". and for another, that was before i knew how conniving she was. now i know. so all i have to do is track her down, cuff her up, and bring her in.}
<P>__{(checking his watch) and i've got,}
<D>__{what, two days? shit, man. easy as pie.}
<A>__{famous last words. sid is regretting his decision as he watches milo go dancing down the street... chriron: "dec 23rd. 9:00am. 48 hours to go." with the sound of multiple ringing phones, cut to:}
