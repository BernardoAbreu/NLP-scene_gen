<L>__{exterior jack buggit's skiff morning}
<A>__{steel gray morning. the sea is more than a little rough, as jack lays out his lobster traps. two other boats, not too close by, appear and disappear in mist. he is checking the lines, knotting hefty weights onto the traps to take them down.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{oh, th' gandy goose she ain't no uuuuse cos all her nuts'n bolts is...}
<A>__{stops. halfway to lowering the next trap over the side.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{sweet jesus. i'm turnin' inta alvin cockadoodle yark!}
<A>__{as it nears the water line, jack's cat skipper tom suddenly leaps down onto the trap. jack blinks.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what is this? suicide attempt?}
<A>__{tries to let go of the trap and grab the cat in one motion, but the cat jumps back to the boat, jack stumbling out of his way, steps in the coiled line which whirrs as the trap goes... ...down, the line strangling jack's leg and whipping him flailing over the side in one startling heartbeat. almost comic to watch. but then. it is very quiet. air bubbles appear at the surface. in a few seconds... the water is unbroken. the boat bobs silently in the swells.}
