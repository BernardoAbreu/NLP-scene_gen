<A>__{a smaller, more simple wreath lands on the calm, dark water beyond the jetty twenty seven years later. truman stares at the wreath for a long moment, turns and wanders back towards the shoreline. in his work suit minus his shoes and socks, he sits on the sand. he has a portable tape recorder slung over his shoulder and points a corded microphone at the surf. for a long while we watch truman's impassive face as he makes the recording of the lapping waves, staring up at the handful of stars visible through the gloom. we focus on the lantern room of a nearby lighthouse. from the light's pov, through the green hue of a night vision camera, we observe truman get to his feet and walk towards the dark water.}
