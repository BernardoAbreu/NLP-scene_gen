<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{what are you talking about? this bar is packed with professional people!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... luckily, i'm currently off men, so i've got the luxury of not giving a shit.}

<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{fuck the details, they're always to blame... look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. i see it at my company all day long! so i'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...}
<P>__{(beat)}

<C>__{betty}
<D>__{rosa, i can't believe you're doing all this for me...thank you.}
