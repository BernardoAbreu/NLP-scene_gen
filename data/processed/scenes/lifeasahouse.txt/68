<L>__{interior josh's porsche night}
<A>__{sam and josh are parked on a street that overlooks the valley east of laguna beach. they share a joint as josh explains the specifics of the job.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{you don't have to do a thing. just get in and get out. as quick as you can. close your eyes and think of whatever.}
<A>__{sam hands the joint to josh.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's your deal with alyssa?}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{don't even...i'm there.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i wasn't sure.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{she wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen. i mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing. she like figures things out on her own and then that's it.}
<A>__{a black mercedes benz pulls to a stop a ways down the street. josh hands sam a cell phone.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{if this rings, run.}
<A>__{sam is scared and it shows.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{he already knows everything about what he can't do. you can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm thinking it's too weird now.}
<A>__{josh pulls a baggie of grass and holds it out for sam, who takes it and stuffs it in his pants pocket.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{it beats working.}
<A>__{josh hands sam the jointerior}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{inhale and get out.}
<A>__{sam is quick to inhale, but slow to get out. josh takes the joint and sam steps out. he walks slowly to the mercedes, opens the door and climbs in. josh turns the cd on to guster's "all the way up to heaven." sam closes the door to the mercedes. 'he said to only look up, he said to never look down, down is where we came from...' it's an odd song sung in a happy tempo; a whistling refrain overtakes the lyrics as josh inhales. 'he said to hope for the best and take a load off my chest. soon, i could be happy, and go all the way up to heaven and go all the way back home.' with the music loud, josh misses the police car as it stops behind him without the lights. too late for a getaway, he fumbles for his cell phone and tosses the joint out the open window. the officer approaches the porsche with his hand on his gun.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{what did you toss into the brush?}
<A>__{josh furtively presses send on his cell phone as he faces the officer with a guilty face.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{'he said i might need his help, no one gets high on themselves. i just seem so lonely; he's just trying to be nice and spread around his advice. i could be happy...'}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{turn off the music!}
<A>__{as the music stops, the door to the mercedes opens and sam hops out with his pants around his ankles. the officer notices and walks towards the mercedes. the parking lights flash red as the car starts and flees the scene. sam yanks up his pants and leaps down the hillside, falling and rolling in the brush as the officer yells for him to stop. josh starts his car, but the officer dissuades him from leaving by removing his gun. josh turns off the engine.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{oh, it's working now.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{what did you toss into the brush?}
<A>__{before josh can feign innocence again, the brush starts to smolder. busted.}
