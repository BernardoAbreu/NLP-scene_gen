<L>__{interior tank day}
<A>__{the nazi soldier knocks henry into a pile of boxes, then punches him in the face. as the soldier raises the gun to henry's face, brody hits him over the head with a canister. the soldier falls, discharging the gun into the air. the bullet ricochets around the tank, past the tank driver who is manipulating levers at the control panel. sparks fly; then the bullet pings against the window and ricochets once more, this time passing through the tank driver's hat. blood flows from under the hat as the tank driver slumps forward, his body depressing the levers.}
