<L>__{interior ned's house night}
<A>__{the front door swings open. frank is standing there, dressed in a cheap, loose fitting suit and a t shirt.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i came back for my shower cap.}
<A>__{lana, now wearing the diaphanous gown, pulls him inside. she kisses him hungrily, slipping a frilly plastic shower cap with a gaudy floral design on his head.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{yeah, well you came to the right place.}
<A>__{she walks to the living room. frank follows, still wearing the shower cap. lana snaps her fingers.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{sit down.}
<A>__{he sits in a chair, looking around.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{on duty all night. by the time he wraps up his reports, it'll be close to noon tomorrow.}
<A>__{she sits on the couch, picks up a stack of papers.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{i was just reading over...}
<A>__{she looks up at frank. sees the shower cap.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{take off the hat, frank.}
<A>__{he slips the shower cap off as lana continues.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{i was just reading over my husband's insurance policies. you wouldn't know anything about insurance, would you, frankie?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, matter of fact, i sell policies part time. i got half a brain... or didn't you notice?}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{i musta had my eye on something else.}
<P>__{(hands him papers)}
<D>__{how about a translation.}
<A>__{he flips through, scanning the pages, shrugging.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{standard accident policy... all the usual stuff... blah, blah, blah. the face value is... wow. not bad. three million bucks!}
<P>__{(flips page)}
<D>__{and there's a triple indemnity rider.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{meaning?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{aw, it's just something agents throw in so we can boost the premium. if the policy holder dies under very specific conditions, it pays off three times the face value of the policy.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{nine million dollars...?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah... but it's a sure bet for the company. nobody ever collects.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, like here... it only pays off if he's shot with a pistol, falls from a moving northbound train and drowns in a fresh water stream.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{all three?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{see what i mean, sweetheart? what are the odds of that?}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{it could happen.}
<P>__{(dramatic beat)}
<D>__{suppose it did happen?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{then you'd be rich.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{then we'd be rich.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what're you sayin'...?}
<A>__{she drops to her knees in front of him, her face close to his, speaking with a persuasive urgency.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{we're gonna kill the son of a bitch! and i know exactly how! he has a legal symposium in santa barbara this weekend... all we have to do is get him to take the train up instead of driving.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{how we gonna do that? didn't you tell me he hates trains?}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{that's where you come in, baby. you're gonna rig his car so it doesn't work. that should be no problem for you.}
<A>__{she gets up, walks to the adjoining room... snapping her fingers at her side. he follows. she steps to a table, pulls the cover off an elaborate scale model of dealey plaza and a train station, complete with ho scale model trains chugging around the tracks. she uses a pointer to trace the route to the depot.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{then... we give him a lift to the train station... through dealey plaza, past the book suppository and around the grassy knoll...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{isn't that out of our way?}
<A>__{ignoring this, she turns the lights off, walks over to a screen and picks up a remote control. she clicks the button. a slide projector comes on, throwing an image on frank's back. we can read the words: the plan.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{move, frank.}
<A>__{he moves over. "the plan" appears on the screen.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{and pay attention.}
<A>__{as she talks, images appear on the screen, accompanying her rapid spiel. we see: a shot of the depot, a map of the rail route, a gun, a river, a bingo game, baseball action and a huge dollar sign!}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{ten minutes out of the station he'll be standing in the vestibule between cars... trying to avoid a panic attack. fourteen minutes and ten seconds out, the train crosses the santa ynez river. so at thirteen minutes and fifty four seconds, i shoot him, shove him out the door... he hits the river and drowns. bingo! a triple play. we're rich!}
<A>__{the lights click on.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you been thinking about this a lot, haven't you?}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{no. it just came to me.}
<P>__{(closer, seductive)}
<D>__{i had this image of a big, powerful, throbbing train... plunging into a long, dark, wet tunnel.}
<A>__{they embrace, kissing passionately, dropping out of frame. the model train chugs faster, the train whistle shrieking a long "woooooooo woooooooooo!"... racing into a model tunnel.}
