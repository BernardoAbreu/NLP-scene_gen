<D>__{there's this prejudice against super smart people. people like gary.}
<A>__{gary (early 40's) reads a statement before a congressional sub committee. his voice is pleasant but firm:}

<D>__{do you mind?}
<A>__{larry gets up. two outpost recruiters, redmond price, 31 (gray suit) and danny baylor, 29 (outpost '98 golf shirt) note the walkout. danny scans headshots in a stanford yearbook. (on screen behind them we see seattle: night streets wet down & shimmering; young people entering a club; young people climbing mt. shasta.) finding larry's picture, danny points out the name to redmond, who shrugs: unconcerned.}

<A>__{the double doors swing open (over them, a plate reads: the hewlitt packard auditorium) and larry comes out. up the hallway continuous alice poulson, a very pretty girl of 21 (more hiply dressed than the geeks) searches the hall, reading the names over the doors (nec communications classroom, toshiba computer lab, mitsubishi classroom). she spots larry.}

<C>__{alice}
<D>__{"make" him?}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<A>__{as we hear larry speak, we cut back into: the auditorium continuous the lights are on. milo & teddy stand by a table dressed in outpost bunting, laden with refreshments & giveaways: mousepads, t shirts, caps & books with the outpost logo on them (a simple contour drawing of a frontier outpost). while most students chat earnestly with recruiters, milo & teddy load their plates with pizza and tortilla chips.}

<D>__{i'm not exactly worldly, but i'm the secretary of state next to him.}
<A>__{milo puts some brownies on his plate.}

<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i can't help it. i feel like they'd do anything to keep their }
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{anything? that's not even credible. if he wants to go up there? to check it out? i think you should encourage him.}
<P>__{(seeing larry's incredulity)}

<C>__{milo}
<D>__{oh hi.}

<D>__{...hello?}
<C>__{gary }
<D>__{milo? gary boyd. i'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. we've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. i'd love to show them to you.}

<C>__{milo}
<D>__{all the companies know. the faculties tell 'em. at the target schools.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{in exchange for endowments. they should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.}

<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{my parents're already freaked out i'm staying here. 50 miles from chinatown.}

<A>__{in a tidy, playfully decorated room, alice stirs in bed, sees the space next to her is vacant. tiny room continuous milo sits at a desk, thinking, agitated, in the dim light of a pc. he looks up, sees alice in the doorway.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i think i kind of lost it. i was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'didn't know i even cared about that stuff.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{c'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of time. three of four times.}
<A>__{she picks her way through geek clutter (motherboards, code manuals, coke cans) sits next to him.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{a lot of what larry says is true. they just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they }
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{then you've gotta ask him about that.}
<A>__{he looks at her: you've gotta be kidding.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{it's important.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{if he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.}

<A>__{he doesn't deny it: she sees right through him.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{when i was a kid? and he was moving us all over the place? i spent all my time writing stuff on outpost 1.0. i thought gary boyd was the greatest.}

<D>__{who do you mean by "everybody."}
<A>__{milo almost blushes. he makes an awkward segue.}

<D>__{oh we're not going to the campus.}
<L>__{exterior gary boyd's compound lake washington day}

<A>__{milo and the houseman cross a long room with a lake view. we hear music by satie. the craftsman furniture and lamps are custom made. a cezanne hangs on the wall. another den like room with a view there's a craftsman crib here, stuffed animals, another cezanne. even the toys seem arranged. they enter an anteroom conference room continuous}
<C>__{houseman}
<D>__{have a seat. he won't be long.}
<A>__{milo sits on a bench. he tries not to look, but his childhood hero is partly visible through a glass panel in the door: gary (in a suit and tie) has an open american face. but something goes on behind his pleasant features and self possessed mien: his desire (or need) to solve the problem at hand is so intense it makes him appear vexed even vulnerable. conference room continuous as gary concentrates, two outpost senior managers speak: phil tate, 40 (bald); and randy grimes, 36, (gray eyes).}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{we tried the big vaporware number, gary, it's no sale.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{can we buy into their ipo? or is that a justice dept. problem?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{there is no public offering. the guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in san luis obispo. 'wrote this just to run their web site.}
<A>__{anteroom continuous gary speaks with precise hand gestures: settling the matter. phil and randy gather their papers, and stand. they exit, nodding at milo as they pass. then gary comes out.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{milo? excuse the tie. i was on tv.}
<A>__{milo is a little dazzled as they shake hands: such a fam iliar face, such a big figure in his young life.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{...that's okay.}
<L>__{interior den like room moving}
<A>__{now new age music plays. they move back through the same room, but the cezanne has been replaced by a hieronymus bosch (bodies roiling in hell). milo is puzzled.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{the house knows the paintings i like, it knows my favorite music. same for anybody else who's in the system.}
<A>__{next room still moving as they walk, milo watches a cezanne "original" digitally re configure to a bosch, brushstrokes and all.}

<D>__{cool!}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{would you like a coke or something?}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(too shy, too nervous)}
<D>__{oh. no thanks.}
<A>__{he opens a glass doored refrigerator, scans a shelf with rows of snapples in alphabetical order.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{when we started, i just hired my smart friends. that was great. we got a little bigger, i had to hire smart strangers. much harder.}
<A>__{he selects a kiwi raspberry, they walk on.}

<D>__{now i don't get to hire anybody. but i know you're the guy to write skywire.}
<L>__{interior gary's workroom (lake view) moments later}
<A>__{they enter. an entire wall is taken up by a bosch triptych. as gary crosses to the other side of the room, milo stands by a table covered in art books hundreds of them (soutine, chinoiserie, roy lichtenstein...)}

<D>__{there's more to life than computers? i'm looking into it.}
<A>__{glancing down at the daunting display of books, gary looks vaguely afflicted. he mutters:}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{'once i start looking into something.}
<A>__{looking up now (and much more at ease) he holds up a shiny, detailed metal object: model satellite.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{i've only shown this to three other people. i bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. i keep the coordinates in this room.}
<P>__{(as milo takes it, carefully)}
<D>__{it's left over from sdi. reagan's star wars technology? they orbit 426 miles up.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{low enough to relay internet traffic.}
<C>__{gary}
<P>__{(he smiles: exactly)}
<D>__{among other things... we know convergence is the real super highway: all the pc's, tv's, phones, etc. linked together. why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?}

<D>__{skywire.}

<C>__{gary}
<D>__{you'd have to start practically from scratch. but this is all you'd be working on. no marketing meetings, no product seminars. we can't waste the time. half the valley's working on convergence. so're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'can't finish second, milo. there is no second... now what would you like to ask me?}

<A>__{as they walk, milo chides himself for his reticence. gary seems to read his mind.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{i know what people say, and not just the justice department. we clone ideas, inflict our second rate versions on the world, we haven't done anything original since 1.0.}
<A>__{milo's amazed by gary's acuity. and his candor.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{do i think that's fair? no. i'd put some of our apps up against anybody's. but is there some truth to it?}
<A>__{they have come to a stop in a windowed entryway. milo watches gary keenly. gary nods. he knits his brow.}

<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{yeah? i wanna feel like i did when i wrote that. but i'm 42, that's 100 in cyber years. i look at you and see the things that got me here.}
