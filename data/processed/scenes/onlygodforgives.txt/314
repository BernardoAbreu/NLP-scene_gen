<A>__{chang leans down next to julian and whispers something into julian's ear so softly that we cannot hear it. whatever it says it instantly has an effect on julian. he visibly relaxes. he doesn't make a sound as he's held down. a plastic strap is tied around his arm as a tourniquet. his arm is pulled out. chang swings the axe and chops off first his left hand and then his right. julian grits his teeth throughout. doesn't scream. chang picks up the severed hands and throws them to the wild dogs. the dogs tear into the meat, fighting over their prize.}
