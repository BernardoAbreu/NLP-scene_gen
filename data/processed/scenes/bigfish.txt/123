<C>__{edward }

<A>__{one by one the men jump out, their chutes clipped to a main line. when his time comes, edward leaps... ...but he's stuck. his cord is caught up in the assembly. he twists and struggles, trying to free himself. looking down, he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the darkness. they're already long gone. digging a knife out of his pocket, edward gets to work cutting through the cable. it finally pops. edward jumps from the plane.}
