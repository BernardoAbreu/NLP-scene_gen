<A>__{cleaning vegetables, sandra is separating the roots, shaking the dirt off, cutting away the excess. todd is carefully following her example, cutting the stalks away with the knife. nathan is tottering across the floor an a beginner's wobbly legs.}

<D>__{it seemed like he was never going to walk. then all of a sudden...he's an expert.}
<A>__{whump! nathan falls on his ass.}
<C>__{sandra}
<P>__{(a laugh)}
<D>__{well, not quite an expert.}
<A>__{todd watches sandra go to nathan and hug him affectionately. turning back to the vegetables, stone faced, todd cuts his finger. blood flows. he ignores it, continues working... but sandra, returning to the vegetables, notices todd's cut finger and immediately grabs a rag and takes his hand. todd looks startled is she takes his finger. then, staunching the blood with the rag, she looks him in the eye, curious.}

<D>__{sergeant todd...what's it like...what's it like being a soldier?}
<A>__{what's it like...? todd stares at her, trying to process the question. seeing his difficulty sandra tries to help...}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{what do you think about?}
<A>__{no answer, a stare.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{do you think about food? or women? you must think about something.}
<A>__{todd gulps. his blank stare could pass for stupidity.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{what about feelings then? you must have feelings. you must feel something.}
<A>__{todd wets his lips. he seems about to answer...and yet it's difficult for him. he could kill a person easier. on the floor nathan goos happily, oblivious.}
