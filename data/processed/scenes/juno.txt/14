<L>__{exterior bleeker house morning}
<A>__{paul bleeker steps onto the front porch of his house for early morning track practice. he wears a cross country uniform that reads "dancing elk condors." he is eating some kind of microwaved snack gimmick. bleeker is startled to discover that juno is outside waiting for him. she has somehow arranged the living room set on the front lawn, and is seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe officiously.}

<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i'm pregnant.}
<A>__{stunned silence. juno pops up the footrest of the recliner and leans back comfortably.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{i guess so.}
<P>__{(fidgeting)}
<D>__{what are you going to do?}
<A>__{the dancing elk prep cross country team runs past bleeker's house in a thundering herd, wearing a motley assortment of warm ups. their momentum stirs the crackling fall leaves. they wave and holler at bleeker and juno.}
<C>__{juno }
<D>__{when i see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, i always picture them naked, even if i don't want to. i have intrusive thoughts all the time.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{i'm supposed to be running.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{there's an awkward silence.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{so, what do you think we should do?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i thought i might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. because i heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{yeah, typically. that's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{so that's cool with you, then?}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{yeah, wizard, i guess. i mean do what you think is right.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i'm real sorry i had sex with you. i know it wasn't your idea.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{whose idea was it?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i will see you at school, o.k.?}
