<A>__{hellboy pounds the floor with his rock hand. furiously.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{hang on kid, i'm coming for you!!}
<A>__{the rocks below him start to crumble.}
<L>__{exterior anthill view of underground tunnels and pits day}
<A>__{in an "ant farm" view of the complex, we see hellboy above, pummeling and in the cavern below liz and myers.}
<L>__{interior tunnel "b" underground tunnel cavern area day}
<A>__{dust and rocks fall from above. the four identical creatures move in on liz and myers. myers shoots one in the head three times. the creature shakes off the hits as if pelted with pebbles. one of them springs. as it flies through the air, hellboy crashes through the ceiling. he lands on top of it along with a ton or two of stone. the creature is crushed. two eggs glow, metamorphosing. presto two new sammaels are born. the first two sammaels growl, joined by the two new ones. liz sprints to safety.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{sorry. just couldn't leave you two alone.}
<A>__{hellboy scoops up myers and deposits him next to liz. lit by myers' flashlight, two of the creatures jump. one clamps onto hellboy's back, the other onto his leg. hellboy howls. the third one joins in, like lions dragging down a zebra. this time, though, the zebra fights back. hellboy pulls out his gun and fires a round into the chest of a sammael. two eggs glow two new sammaels are born. they're five. hellboy's torso is covered in blood. he falls to the ground. a fourth and a fifth creature spring onto him, biting. hellboy is in trouble. liz watches and shivers. a ripple of heat shimmers over her body.}

<P>__{(at myers)}
<D>__{hit me.}
<C>__{myers}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{liz is desperate, crying.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{hit me }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{all of my life i've run away from it... now i want it to happen! do it.}
<A>__{hellboy screams. water explodes under the fighting bodies. two of the sammaels turn their attention to liz and myers.}
<C>__{myers}
<D>__{i can't, i }
<A>__{liz slaps him.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i know now: i love him. i've always loved him.}
<A>__{a beat of silence, then myers slaps her across the face, once. hard. the heat ripple builds. the air vibrates around her. her pupils kick back light, like an animal's.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{go now.}
<A>__{myers ducks behind a rock as liz's arms blaze with fire. the two approaching sammaels are ready to pounce. on top of hellboy, one of them turns its head, like a lion hearing the hunter's gunshots. a staggering hellboy sees liz's body shake in a surge of white hot energy.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<P>__{(weak)}
<D>__{liz...}
<A>__{the water at her feet blows away as a concave shockwave of fire expands. the fire engulfs the creatures. devours them all.}
