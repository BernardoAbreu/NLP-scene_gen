<L>__{exterior pier night}
<A>__{the van pulls into a the loading bay of a warehouse at the end of a short pier on the harlem river.}
<L>__{interior warehouse night}
<A>__{bullethead and a henchman pull ray and claude from the back of the van. they find themselves in a dark warehouse filled with crates of contraband.}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{what are they gonna do to us?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you? dine and ditch, right?}
<P>__{(claude nods)}
<D>__{over ten bucks?}
<P>__{(he nods again)}
<D>__{you're probably looking at a thumb.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{a thumb? what do you mean, like cut it off? for ten bucks?}
<P>__{(ray nods)}
<D>__{that include the tip?}
<A>__{claude shoves his hands under his armpits at the sound of approaching footsteps echoing across the vast space. claude and ray peer into the darkness.}
<C>__{spanky}
<P>__{(from the darkness)}
<D>__{you picked the wrong night to fuck with me, ray. i just lost three men and a truck full of canadian whiskey. you know what that kind of thing does to my business? it makes me want to lash out and hurt somebody.}
<A>__{spanky johnson emerges into the light. he uses a small silver spoon to take an ample snort of cocaine into each nostril. he glances at claude.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{who's he? friend of yours, ray?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i never saw this man before tonight. he's a lowlife degenerate who lurks in bathrooms. i'm a professional man, an upstanding citizen. i go to church on sunday.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{then what are you doing here?}
<C>__{bullethead}
<D>__{failure to pay.}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(rattled)}
<D>__{look, mr. johnson, you seem like a reasonable man. i got a good job starts monday. i will pay you back with my first pay check. with interest. i don't want to tell you how to conduct your business, but if you cut off my finger you won't get jack. working an adding machine, i gotta be whole.}
<P>__{(his fingers dancing over imaginary keys)}
<D>__{i need my thumbs and all my fingers for praying and doing good...}
<A>__{spanky holds up a hand, silencing claude.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{the choirboy wants to keep his fingers. who am i to argue? drop him.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{drop him? what does drop him mean?}
<A>__{claude protests loudly as bullethead and the henchman bind his hands and feet. spanky turns to ray.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{you gotta lotta balls showing your face around my club. if a man's gonna run numbers on my side of broadway, you think he'd have the common sense to keep a low profile. but not ray gibson.}
<A>__{the goons hoist claude up on another pulley and dangle him head first over a hole in the floor. several feet down, the harlem river laps against the wooden pylons.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{no, not down there! that water's filthy! help me out here, man!}
<A>__{shrugging, ray pinches his nose and puffs out his cheeks. the goons release the rope and claude plunges into the water. spanky turns back to ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you don't have to drown that fella, spanky. you already scared him half to death. he didn't know who he was fucking with.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{but you do. what does that say about you, ray? what does that say about me? i've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. but he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so i guess i'm gonna have to school you myself.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{come on, spank, i'm just trying to get by here. you remember how it was when you were starting out.}
<A>__{the henchman yanks on the rope. claude emerges from the hole, gasping for breath.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i was supposed to wear this suit on monday!}
<A>__{the henchman releases the rope, sending claude back into the water. ray reaches into his jacket. bullethead pulls a gun and presses it into ray's temple. ray gives him a look and cautiously pulls out his bottle.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{what's that, some of your bathtub brew?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{puerto rican rum. see for yourself.}
<A>__{ray tosses him the bottle. spanky uncorks, sniffs, samples the goods. he's impressed.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{where'd you get this?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{comes up the mississippi. i can get more. a lot more. i was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, i'd be willing to take on a partner.}
<A>__{once again, the henchman yanks on the rope and claude comes up sucking air desperately. he releases the rope, submerging claude for a third time.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{i'm interested. keep talking.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{all i need is the front money and a truck. i could be back in two, three days tops if i had somebody to share the driving.}
<A>__{spanky considers the terms. can he afford to trust ray? can he afford not to?}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{if you fuck me on this one, i will spare no expense.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{understood.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{alright, ray, you've got a deal. pick your man and get going.}
<A>__{ray glances around. the pulley rope is still twitching in the water.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i will take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{if i was you, i'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.}
<A>__{spanky sees ray's pointerior he nods to the henchman, who hoists claude's limp body out of the water and onto the cement. spanky plants a foot on claude's chest and applies pressure. a geyser of harlem river water shoots from claude's mouth as he sputters back to life.}
<C>__{spanky}
<D>__{for your sake, i hope you can drive. somebody give him some dry clothes.}
