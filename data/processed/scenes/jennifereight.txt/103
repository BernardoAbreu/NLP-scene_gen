<L>__{103: exterior shasta trinity institute. night.}
<A>__{this is probably a crane shot. a gale works up the valley. the institute is in total darkness. not a vehicle out front. not a sound except the marauding wind. ross's chevrolet is concealed amongst trees. been here long enough to allow slow flurries to accumulate. it stares towards the building maybe 75 yards away.}
<L>__{104: interior chevrolet sedan. night.}
<A>__{berlin wears a black wool hat. ross a big black overcoat. both got shit frozen out of them. a bottle available and anyone who wants a slug better help himself. plus sleet on the windshield and a lot of stale time. berlin asks what time it is? and ross takes a heave on the booze and waits for about a week to go by.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{where's your watch?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i guess by the bed.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{it's twenty of three.}
<A>__{yawns do a circuit. ross flops in his seat and the angle chang es. the view from the rear covers windscreen and back of heads.}
<D>__{a little young for you, bro?}
<P>__{(gets his eyes)}
<D>__{you think if she could see, she'd be hanging around with an old dog like you? you got a stomach growing around to meet itself behind your back.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{bull shit .. i'm in my prime ..}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{bits.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{what d'you mean, "bits."}
<A>__{a star light on the windshield. distant and nobody seen it yet.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{policemen's bodies age at diff erent rates. look at me. gut in its fifties. balls in their six ties. and feet in their eighties ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{hit those wipers, ross.}
<A>__{urgency snaps him into close up. big noise as wipers clear the screen. "i thought i saw a light?" berlin stares at the instit ute through small binoculars. "there. flashlight went right ac ross those windows!" instant excitement as the adrenalin pumps in. "fourth floor. see it? he's fucken in there!" and suddenly everything including super sinister music is happening at once.}
