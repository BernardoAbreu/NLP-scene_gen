<L>__{exterior warehouse area night}
<A>__{tessio and clemenza quickly load racks of cheap dresses. vito sits behind the wheel of the truck. he seems reserved, and we get the impression that he is studying every move his two friends are making.}
<L>__{interior tenement stairs day}
<A>__{clemenza runs up a flight of stairs with an armful of dresses. he knocks on a door, and a pretty housewife answers.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{lady, i got a bargain on these dresses. five dollars each. you gotta pay at least fifteen, maybe twenty in a store. look at them, first class.}
<A>__{he holds the dresses up and the woman seems interested. she handles a couple of them and stands aside so clemenza can enter her apartment.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{i don't know which one i like best.}
<A>__{she holds the dresses against her body, clemenza approving of each one; and then she goes to her purse and takes out five singles and gives them to him.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{you'd look beautiful in all of these. you should buy at least two.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{are you kidding? my husband will kill me if he knows i paid five dollars for one dress.}
<A>__{she holds one up, then another. she is torn. clemenza shakes his head and straightens the dress on her body. his hand brushes her arm; she looks at him smiling.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{you can have two for five.}
<A>__{she smiles back.}
