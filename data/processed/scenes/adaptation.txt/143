<L>__{interior empty bedroom night}
<A>__{kaufman is on the floor typing. his mini recorder is on.}
<C>__{kaufman's voice }
<D>__{kaufman sits across from valerie, a pretty film executive. he eyes her as she picks at her salad. she looks up and he looks down. he sweats. she compliments him on his work. she rubs her nose. he pulls at his nostrils. he tries to sound like he knows what he's talking about. he's full of shit.}
