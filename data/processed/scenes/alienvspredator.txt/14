<A>__{a storm is brewing. a large gray vessel cuts through the packed ice. a helicopter thunders into view. its twin rotors chopping through the falling snow. it's dropping in altitude. headed for the piper maru.}
<C>__{pilot }
<D>__{weyland 14 to piper maru. we are on approach.}
<L>__{interior piper maru hold number one}
<A>__{surrounded by thermal digging equipment, three separate teams are assembled in the briefing area. team 1: (the scientists) lex, sebastian, thomas, (sebastian's right hand from mexico) and miller. team 2: (the muscle) max and weyland, security personnel adele rousseau (sexy, tough and toned); verheiden a soldier of fortune that has fought in hotspots all over the world and earned a prominent scar down his face as a souvenir; connors (bearded outdoorsman who looks like a chiseled version of the unabomber) and klaus (a big dane built like a viking.) team 3: (the drillers) lead by quinn, (a muscular texan and third generation driller) and roughnecks sven, boris and mikkel. standing between boris and sven, miller looks like a thread of dental floss. miller, excitedly bouncing around the room like a human pinball, jumps inside the cab of one of quinn's large drilling machines. he begins to press buttons like a kid.}
<C>__{verheiden}
<D>__{having fun?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{first real adventure. can't wait to tell my kids about all this.}
<C>__{verheiden}
<D>__{this might be an adventure for you, "dad" but for the rest of us, it's a job. get off the equipment and go back to the suburbs before you walk us all off a cliff.}
<A>__{lex approaches. miller doesn't want to back down so easily in front of her. he holds his ground.}
<C>__{verheiden }
<D>__{get off or you'll be wearing your ass for a hat.}
<A>__{miller moves. he regains his composure.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{nice team spirit.}
<A>__{verheiden looks at his men can you believe this guy?}
<C>__{verheiden}
<P>__{(to max)}
<D>__{keep the beakers away from the gear.}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(to lex)}
<D>__{what's a beaker?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{it's what they call scientists out here. you know...beaker? like in the muppet show.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{beaker... i kinda like that.}
<A>__{thomas approaches sebastian, sitting down.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{weyland's cheque cleared.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{good. we're going to listen to whatever he has to say. we nod, we smile and then we politely decline whatever offer he makes, take the money and head back to mexico.}
<A>__{max looks around the room to make sure everyone is here.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{welcome aboard everybody! please. you probably wonder why this elite team of experts was assembled here? your host will give you the answer now.}
<A>__{the room falls quiet.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{mr. weyland.}
<A>__{a man emerges from the shadows behind max charles bishop weyland. weyland, in his forties, looks more like a big game hunter than the billionaire that he is. an assistant hands a tablet pc to everyone in the room as weyland nods to max to fire up a digital projector, illuminating a large square of the peeling metal wall behind weyland.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{thank you all for coming. seven days ago one of my satellites over antarctica was hunting for mineral deposits when a sudden heat bloom beneath the earth outlined this...}
<A>__{an image comes up on the wall behind weyland. we've seen it before. a pattern of interlocking square shapes. an intense ripple of excitement spreads through the room.}
<C>__{weyland }
<D>__{the red lines indicate solid walls. through thermal mapping we've generated a rough three dimensional image of the structure. it's massive ... containing hundreds of rooms, all built around a central core. my experts tell me it's a pyramid. what they can't agree on is who built it and when.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{what caused the heat bloom?}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{we don't know.}
<A>__{sebastian clicks past the photographs on his tablet pc.}
<C>__{weyland }
<P>__{(snaps slide)}
<D>__{one expert tells me that this feature is reminiscent of the aztecs.}
<P>__{(snaps slide)}
<D>__{another tells me that this is probably cambodian.}
<P>__{(snaps slide)}
<D>__{but everyone agrees that the smooth side is definitively egyptian.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{why would anyone build a pyramid out here?}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{ancient maps show antarctica free of ice. it's likely that the continent was once habitable.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{mr. de rosa?}
<A>__{sebastian steps closer to the wall, examining the pictures and comparing them with the pictures on his tablet pc.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i think your experts are right.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{which one?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{all of them. the egyptians, the cambodians and the aztecs all built pyramids. three separate cultures that lived thousands of miles apart }
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{ with no communication between them.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{yet what they built was almost identical.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{meaning what exactly?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{this might be the first pyramid ever built.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{built by whom?}
<A>__{sebastian can barely contain his excitement.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{the master culture from which all others are derived.}
<A>__{everyone in the room is stunned.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{if it could be the first pyramid, it could also be the last. an amalgam of the ones that came before it. there's no proof of any connection between the cultures.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{this photo is the proof.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(interjecting)}
<D>__{um...i can't tell you who built it but if i could take a sample from it, i could tell you how old it is.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{within how many years, professor?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{actually, it's doctor. and i will give you the exact year.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{well doctor miller, i'm offering to put you right next to this thing.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{where exactly on the ice is this?}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{bouvetoya island. but it's not on the ice. it's two thousand feet under it.}
<P>__{(next picture)}
<D>__{directly below this abandoned whaling station which will serve as our base camp.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{mr. quinn.}
<A>__{quinn steps forward from his men. it's clear that quinn and his men are a tight group that keep to themselves.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{mr. stafford, you're looking at the best drilling team in the world. we'll chew to that depth in seven days.}
<A>__{sven, boris and mikkel nod in agreement.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{and add three weeks on top of that to train everyone here.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{we don't have that kind of time. i'm not the only one with a satellite over antarctica. others will be here soon.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{maybe i wasn't clear. no one in this room is ready for this trip.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{that's why i invited you here.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{bouvetoya is one of the most isolated places in the world. the nearest land is a thousand miles away. there's no help if we run into trouble.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{you're right, it's a no man's land. but the train has left the station. i think i speak for everyone aboard this ship }
<P>__{(points to amazing imagery of pyramid)}
<D>__{this is worth the risk. lex looks around as a chorus of excitement is heard. their minds are made up. she turns to weyland.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{find another guide.}
<A>__{and she walks out.}
