<A>__{the rental van pulls up to a g 3 jet warming up outside a private hanger. the van doors open and the hostages are brought out. harry sees a long black limo pulling up behind the van. the driver, an enormous man names akbar, hurries to open the passenger door. a slender pair of ankles emerge, followed by the rest of juno skinner, looking devastatingly beautiful but now quite sinister. to helen it is like a living james bond film, with the jet, the limo, the terrorists, and now an exotic femme fatale, dressed to kill, approaching them.}
