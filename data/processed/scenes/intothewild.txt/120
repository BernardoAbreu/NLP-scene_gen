<L>__{interior double wide night}
<A>__{as wayne and chris enter, they tip toe over empty booze bottles and passed out work crew; wayne's harvesting team. they make their way to a small table in the kitchenette. remains of the evening's dinner are on the stove. wayne turns on the stovetop coils to heat it up.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{so where is it you're headed?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i was thinking about doubling back through the canadian side of glacier park.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{yeah, i used to have a girlfriend who'd go there, camp on the black feet res. she was into all that american indian stuff.}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{i can bring you to the border at sweet grass once you've had some food.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{well, that'd be great. what do you do out here?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{well, i do a lot of things. computer programming. video game repair. i'm a licensed pilot, own a grain elevator in carthage and another one a few miles out of town. but in the summertime i run a combine crew, follow the harvest from texas way the hell north to the canadian border. we just got done cutting barley for coors and anheuser busch. but then i got this little black box deal on the}
<P>__{side (you know what i mean?)}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you mean those free satellite tv deals?}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(as though he hadn't brought it up)}
<D>__{you said it, not me.}
<A>__{chris is dazzled by this renaissance man of the plains. wayne stands to dish out a couple of plates of heated food. as chris starts digging in, a major gust of wind rocks the trailer.}
<C>__{wayne }
<P>__{(smiling, responding to wind)}
<D>__{ooooooh.}
<A>__{chris doesn't respond, digs into the food. points to the unconscious tribe splayed out. six germanic looking}
<B>__{unconscious bodies.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{who are these guys?}
<A>__{wayne gets a little giggle.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{those are my hudderites. agriculture's a pretty transient business. these guys come off the hudderite colony looking for work. i always got work for people. then that guy }
<C>__{wayne }
<P>__{(pointing at guy making most of his snore)}
<D>__{that's kevin. he's with me most of the time. he's not a hudderite. he's from madison.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{madison. okay.}
<A>__{just then, the rain kicks in full gear outside, pounding the trailer shell. a couple hits of lightning follow.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{listen, you don't want to go out there on the road tonight. why don't you just roll your sleeping bag out and play like a hudderite until morning.}
<A>__{chris looks about. there's not much room but it beats the pelting outside.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{thanks wayne. i will.}
