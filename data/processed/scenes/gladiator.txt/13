<L>__{exterior battlefield sunset}
<A>__{maximus, bloody and spent, walks through the aftermath of the carnage. the wolf of rome is at his side. dead and dying by the hundreds are scattered everywhere. roman surgeons are attending to the wounded. marcus walks to him, embraces him warmly.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{caesar.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{maximus, you prove your valor again. let us hope for the final time here.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i don't think there's anyone left to fight.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{there are always people left to fight...}
<A>__{marcus takes maximus' arm and they walk through the masses of bodies. maximus holds marcus' arm firmly, quietly supporting him as they walk.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{but this night, at least, germania is at last defeated... what will you do now, my friend?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{should caesar permit, i will go home. i've been away too long. i've forgotten my wife's face and i barely know my son.}
<A>__{suddenly, a tethered german prisoner they are passing calls out to them:}
<C>__{german prisoner}
<D>__{this blood means nothing, conqueror!}
<A>__{maximus and marcus stop. a soldier moves quickly to silence the german prisoner.}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(to soldier)}
<D>__{stop...}
<P>__{(to prisoner)}
<D>__{... you speak our language?}
<C>__{german prisoner}
<D>__{you have been in my homeland for twelve years. of course i speak your language. so did my son, who you murdered. so did my daughter, who you raped.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(to marcus)}
<D>__{come, caesar...}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{no. let him speak...}
<P>__{(to prisoner)}
<D>__{... i am rome, what would you say to me?}
<C>__{german prisoner}
<P>__{(points to sunset)}
<D>__{you are that sun, rome, and your time is over... you can slit a thousand throats here, and you can put a thousand babies to the sword, but it will always be our home.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{now it is rome.}
<C>__{german prisoner}
<D>__{it will never be rome. not as long as one german breathes.}
<A>__{the soldier moves to kill the insolent prisoner.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{no... release him. give him safe passage. let him go to his family.}
<A>__{the soldier leads the german prisoner away. maximus and marcus continue walking in silence for a beat. then:}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{tell me again, maximus, why are we here?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{for the glory of the empire, sire.}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{yes. i remember.}
<A>__{they continue walking through the mountains of bodies...}
