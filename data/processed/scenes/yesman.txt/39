<C>__{bank customer}
<D>__{i want to refi my house and spend the capital on my personal business. i see you've got a 5.25 7 year arm, but over at chase they're offering 5.00 7 year arm. can you refi lower, like at 4.85 par example, or am i going to have to bring my beeswax elsewhere?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{bank customer}
<D>__{yes? that's it?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{yup. what's your business?}
<C>__{bank customer}
<D>__{selling beanie babies online.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{adorable.}
<C>__{bank customer}
<D>__{more like highly profitable. i've crunched the numbers.}
<A>__{the woman hands over a scrapbook that's been decorated with construction paper and pictures of beanie babies. carl opens the scrapbook. it's filled with numbers.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{let me just get final approval on this.}
<A>__{carl gets up and walks over to norman. angle on norman's office carl stands before norman.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you're a teller, not a loan specialist.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{no, i know, so if you think this is a bad idea for a loan that's fine but can you please tell her yourself?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{her business plan.}
<A>__{norman grabs the business plan and starts reading it.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{inta maresting. my grandma loves beanie babies. although unfortunately, we have a minimum loan floor of ten thousand dollars. she only wants five.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{that's silly. how're you supposed to start a tiny business if you can't get a tiny business loan?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i don't make the rules, i just break `em.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i don't break them. i just wanted to rhyme. if she wants us to loan her ten thousand or more, great. otherwise, i think her only option is a loan shark.}
<B>__{angle on loan desk}
<A>__{carl sits back down.}
<C>__{bank customer}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{so, what'd he say?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{do you maybe have any interest in borrowing ten thousand?}
<C>__{bank customer}
<D>__{i can't afford the payments on ten. you can't do five thousand? this is the fifth bank i've been to. please?}
<C>__{carl}

<C>__{norman}
<D>__{oooh, thank you. feed the addiction, am i right?}
<A>__{they clink diet cokes. norman downs his entire diet coke in one swallow. carl then heads over to the photocopier. he watches norman out of the corner of his eye. after a couple minutes, norman gets up and heads into the bathroom. carl heads back over to norman's desk and swipes the loan approval}
