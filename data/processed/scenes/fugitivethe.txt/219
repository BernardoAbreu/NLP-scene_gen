<A>__{kimble moves instinctively to the back door. he starts to open it but through the dirty window, he sees the back courtyard covered by more cops. kimble moves back toward the front. unsure of his next move, he's sweating, preparing for the worst. he watches the tac team charge the house but instead of charging through the basement door they move up the front steps and into the house overhead. overhead he hears the screaming from the arresting cops. kimble's pov back steps kimble sees the punk kid try to escape out the back. he runs, sees cops and runs toward kimble's basement door, actually reaching it before he is caught by the cops and pulled away.}
