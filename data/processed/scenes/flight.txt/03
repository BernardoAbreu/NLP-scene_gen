<A>__{she digs in her purse, lights a cigarette and continues digging in her purse. she finds a beat up candy tin. she opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt foils, heroin foils, looking for residue. nothing. she now finds and holds up the 100 bucks she just made. she flips open her cheap phone and makes a call...she thinks better of it and hangs up.}
