<A>__{belinda conine stands before andrew (interior day).}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{you said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." is that correct?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{do you take risks?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{in my work? yes. calculated risks. you have to.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{in general. do you take risks in other areas of your life?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{not unnecessary ones.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{have you ever been to the apollo cinema on sansom street?}
<A>__{joe cringes a little with discomfort.}

<C>__{andrew }
<D>__{now what do we do?}
<A>__{robert laughs, closing the door of the booth.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i think we'll figure it out.}
<A>__{back to the courtroom (interior day): joe sits with a stone sober expression: this isn't easy.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{when? approximately what year did this event take place?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{i guess it was 1984, 85.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called aids, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{it's impossible to know exactly when or how i was infected with hiv.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{but you were having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{that happened once. people weren't talking about aids then, the way we are now. or safe sex.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{you'd heard of aids in 1984, 85?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{i'd heard of something . the gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.}
<A>__{close shot on andrew losing strength.}
<C>__{belinda }
<P>__{(sounds far away)}
<D>__{do you need a break?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{while you were employed at wyant wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{that is not correct. i never lied about it.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?}
<A>__{image: andrew in bob seidman's office, working, spotting a photo on the wall of bob's wife and children (interior day).}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{some do. i didn't.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{as a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{in some situations.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{objection!}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{i will withdraw it. mr. beckett? were you living with miguel alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?}
<A>__{angle on miguel, sitting next to sarah.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{you could have infected him, isn't that right?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{miguel has not been infected. as i said, we weren't aware of aids, then, or how it is spread.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{andrew wipes sweat from his forehead.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{you've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{and it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had aids and fired you.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{do you have any lesions on your face at this time?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{one. here, in front of my ear.}
<A>__{an assistant hands conine a shaving mirror. she holds it before andrew.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{remembering you are under oath, answering truthfully, can you see the lesion on your face, in this mirror, three feet away? answering truthfully.}
<A>__{andrew looks in the mirror: the lesion is not very visible.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{by the time i was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{answer the question, please.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{no. i can't really see it.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{andrew rubs his eyes.}
<C>__{judge garnett }
<P>__{(far away)}
<D>__{this would be a good time to break for the day...}
<C>__{joe }
<P>__{(far away)}
<D>__{your honor? may i have ten minutes in re direct?}
<C>__{judge garnett }
<P>__{(far away)}
<D>__{beckett?}
<A>__{andrew finds the judge looking at him.}
<C>__{judge garnett }
<D>__{can you go on for ten minutes?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<A>__{joe jumps up from the plaintiff's table.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i only need five!}
<P>__{(to belinda, reaching for the mirror)}
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{joe approaches andrew, with the mirror.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{do you have any lesions on any part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{yes. on my torso.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{if it please the court, i'd like to ask mr. beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an accurate idea of what we're talking about.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{we object, your honor. it would unfairly influence the jury.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{your honor, if mr. beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? we're talking about aids, we're talking about lesions. let's see what we're talking about.}
<A>__{angle on members of the jury looking apprehensive.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<P>__{(a moment, then)}
<D>__{i will allow it. would you mind removing your shirt, mr. beckett?}
<A>__{angle on miguel tense.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{allright.}
<A>__{the courtroom turns silent. andrew removes his suit jacket. he's weak, so the smallest gesture requires effort. angle on bob seidman watching. andrew undoes his tie. angle on the marine juror watching. andrew unbuttons his collar buttons, working his way down. angle on sarah beckett watching. andrew stands, pulling his shirttails out of his trousers. angle on charles wheeler watching. andrew removes his shirt there are purple blotches}
<B>__{splayed across his chest and abdomen and arms.}
<A>__{the schoolteacher juror gasps. sarah beckett is silently crying. the lesbian juror closes her eyes.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{thank you.}
<B>__{camera moves in on charles wheeler...}
