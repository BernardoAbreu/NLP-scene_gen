<A>__{reclining on a straw mattress, claude watches intently as daisy gets dressed. the rickety door reverberates with a loud pounding.}
<C>__{hoppin' bob}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{time's up, banks! we got a crowd gathering out here!}
<A>__{claude leaps from the bed and slams his fist against the door.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{woman came all the way from new york, goddamnit! we'll come out when we're good and ready!}
<A>__{daisy quickly buttons up her dress.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{did you go see my cousin maynard like i asked you in my letter?}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{of course i did. he said he'd file an appeal right away. you didn't tell me he was so good looking.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. i hope he don't mess things up.}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{he seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. his offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th street, and he was using all these words i never heard before. he even offered me a job.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{a job, huh? well, that's nice, real nice. you won't have to work long. i will be back soon enough. after i start work at first federal bank of manhattan, i will be keeping you in style. everything will get back to normal again. that's a promise.}
<A>__{daisy smiles weakly and looks away. she doesn't have much faith in this promise.}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{listen, claude, maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{ray gibson?}
<P>__{(thinks about it)}
<D>__{no, no. he's the reason i'm in here, daisy. for all i know, he's got a record a mile long. i got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. you tell maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. understand?}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{sure, claude, whatever you say.}
