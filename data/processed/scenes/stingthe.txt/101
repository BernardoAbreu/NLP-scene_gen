<C>__{garfield}
<D>__{we bought ya a tap into moe anenberg's wire. he's got eyes at every track in the country. you'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as western union gets 'em.}

<D>__{you got moxie, eirie. get yourself a suit.}
<A>__{eirie is so happy, he can barely blurt out a thank you. buck duff, enraged that twist would hire a total amateur, turns in disgust and strides vengefully out of the store.}
