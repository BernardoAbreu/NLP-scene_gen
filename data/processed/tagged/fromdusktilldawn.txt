<A>__{if the titty twister looked like the asshole of the world from the outside, in the immortal words of al jolson, "you ain't seen nothin' yet." this is the kind of place where they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood and the beer at closing. in the back, topless dancers do lap dances with customers, while a sleazy sexy stripper strips to raunchy music, played at ear drum bursting level. two men are in a savage bareknuckle fight, surrounded by screaming customers of bikers and truckers. one of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his name is danny the wonder pony. the woman on his back, in the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is athena, his rider. they dance around to the cheers of the crowd. bikers and truckers play pool in the back. fights break out here about one every ten minutes. the customers may start 'em, but the bouncer, big emilio, ends 'em. seth, richard, jacob, scott and kate walk through the door. they each individually take in the sights and the smells. seth is the first to say something.}

<A>__{the lights go down low. a light hits the stage. the opening notes of the coaster's "down in mexico" fills the room. the crowd hushes up. and on the stage steps santanico pandemonium. this mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that stendhal described in "as the promise of happiness," but the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom. she dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the stage, but like she owned the world. and if the patrons of the titty twister are her world, the world is proud to be her possession. all activity in the bar, save santanico, stops. even the fuller gecko table falls under her spell. especially richard, scott and kate. seth knows this song and accompanies from the table with the guitar. when the music builds to its explosive section. santanico leaps from the stage, landing in the middle of the room. she does an eyes closed voodoo dance in perfect step with the beat. as the music continues to play, a very fucked up looking chet pussy walks in. he goes over to razor charlie and points at seth's table, describing what happened. as the last verse plays, santanico, like a snake, comes up from the ground, on top of the fuller gecko table. richard, kate and scott are enraptured. santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy richard. she stands over him. while moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg. she lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her toes, and sticks it in richard's face.}

<P>__{(to richard in spanish)}
<D>__{drink up.}

<A>__{he plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being staked, chet lets out a sigh of relief. by this time there are not too many people left. most of the vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the customers have been butchered or drained. all that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers and two whores. on the human side are seth, jacob and his kids, sex machine and frost. aside from the children, who are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding wooden stakes. the four human men group together. the four female vampires charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood. seth, jacob, sex machine and frost raise their weapons and slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. all four staked bodies hit the floor. kate and scott run from behind the bar to their father's side. they all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has taken place. the floor is littered with dead bodies.}

<A>__{at that moment a bright flash erupts, illuminating everyone's face. the sound of quick burning flames fills the air. everybody shields their eyes from the intense light, which lasts only a split second. it vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. all that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies once lay. they all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then run for the door. it's locked. they bang on the door, but it's useless. it ain't budging, yet they all go on banging. except for seth. he never ran for the door. he walks over to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it. he takes his dead hand.}

<A>__{jacob runs to a table top. he grabs it and covers the area the bats are trying to claw through. the others grab other items to help secure and barricade the door. as the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and the windows, a dead biker that the vampires fed on, pops open his yellow eyes. he sits up and sees all the furious activity. everyone's so busy they don't notice their new friend. the dead biker vamp sets his sights on kate, who's putting a board into place. he springs to his feet and pounces on her, just as sex machine turns from across the room in her direction.}

<A>__{kate and sex machine give each other a high five and go to work staking the dead bodies. jacob and frost beat down the fire with their jackets and whatever else is at hand. a hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered over. little claws scrape their way through. scott stands in front of the window.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{we got a problem!}
<A>__{seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in scott's direction. the hole in the plaster cracks open and out pops a little, fleshy vampire bat rat head. the bat rat, which is squeaking and hissing its head off, tries to squeeze its body through the newly formed hole. seth, gun in hand, runs to the window. he points the .45, point blank range at the head of the bat rat. the bat rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and yanks his head back through the hole. seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment, when... wham ! the bat rat bursts through the hole, like shot out of a cannon, hitting seth in the gut and sending him flying, landing hard on his back. once seth hits the ground, the bat thing (which has the body of a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity split runs up seth's body to his juggler. seth's hand grabs the bat's neck, and tries to push it away. but the bat thing has its claws dug in seth's clothes. the bat thing is just inches from seth's face. its mouth is snapping.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{get this bastard off of me!}
<A>__{frost leaves jacob with the fire, comes from behind and grabs the bat thing and yanks it off of seth. sex machine and kate are a green, bloody mess from their preventative staking of dead bodies. sex machine kneels by a dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. the body springs up and bites sex machine on the arm. red blood squirts all over. sex machine screams, then brings the stake down in the body's chest. it dies, burns and turns into goo. sex machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of his shirt. he quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him get bit. nobody saw it, everybody was too busy. frost holds the flapping, fighting, snapping bat thing in front of him at arm's length. he struggles with it for a while, then... bashes its head against the bar. the first bash takes some fight out of the little fucker, so... frost bashes his head against the bar six or seven times. he then throws the bat thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a cup next to the register, and rams it in the bat thing's heart. the bat thing coughs and dies. there's a flash of flames, followed by a pile of goo. sex machine and kate have covered up a hole in the plastered window with a table while frost, scott and seth wrestle with the bat thing. jacob has put out the fire. everybody comes together, exhausted, and takes a breather. outside, the bats continue to try and claw their way in.}

<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{okay, does anybody here know what's going on?}

<D>__{yeah, i know what's going on. we got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! that's it, plain and simple. and i don't wanna hear any bullshit about "i don't believe in vampires" because i don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. but i do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes i saw fuckin' vampires! now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.}
<A>__{everybody agrees.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you too, preacher?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm like you. i don't believe in vampires, but i believe in what i saw.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{good for you. now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? crosses hurt vampires. do you have a cross?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{in the winnebago.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{in other words, no.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{what are you talking about? we got crosses all over the place. all you gotta do is put two sticks together and you got a cross.}
<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{he's right. peter cushing does that all the time.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i don't know about that. in order for it to have any power, i think it's gotta be an official crucifix.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what's an official cross? some piece of tin made in taiwan? what makes that official? if a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. the cross is a symbol of holiness.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{okay, i will buy that. so we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{wooden stakes in the heart been workin' pretty good so far.}

<D>__{then who cares?}

<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{yeah, that's true, but i doubt our barricades, that door, those plastered windows and these walls will last two more hours with those bat fucks fuckin' with 'em.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{has anybody here read a real book about vampires, or are we just remembering what a movie said? i mean a real book.}

<P>__{(in a cowboy voice)}

<C>__{seth}
<D>__{aside from they're thirsty.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{well, one thing, they might got super human strength, but you can hurt 'em.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yeah, that bottle upside the head of santanico didn't kill her, but it didn't feel too good either.}
<C>__{sex machine}
<D>__{another thing, you try and ram a broken chair leg in a human, you better be one strong son of a bitch. the human body is one rough tough machine. but these vamps got soft bodies. the texture of their skin is softer, mushier. you can push shit right through 'em. conceivably, if you hit one hard enough, you could take their fuckin' head off.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{you could take their head off.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.}

<D>__{he's a preacher.}
<A>__{frost and sex machine look toward jacob.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{as far as god's concerned, we might just as well be a piece of fuckin' shit. but he's one of the boys. only one problem, his faith ain't what it used to be.}
<A>__{jacob punches seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor. jacob stands over him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i've had enough of your taunts.}
<A>__{seth looks up from the floor.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i'm not taunting you. we need you. a faithless preacher doesn't mean shit to us. but a man who's a servant of god can grab a cross, shove it in these monsters' asses. a servant of god can bless the tap water and turn it into a weapon.}
<A>__{seth rises.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i know why you lost your faith. how could true holiness exist if your wife can be taken away from you and your children? now, i always said god can kiss my fuckin' ass. well, i changed my lifetime tune about thirty minutes ago' cause i know, without a doubt, what's out there trying to get in here is pure evil straight from hell. and if there is a hell, and those monsters are from it, there's got to be a heaven. now which are you, a faithless preacher or a mean, mother fuckin' servant of god?}
<A>__{jacob has to laugh at that. so does everybody else. jacob sticks out his hand and shakes seth's.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm a mean, mother fucking servant of god.}
<A>__{the laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing. it immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit they're in.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i don't know if i can take two hours of that noise.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{you can. you'll take it 'cause ya got no choice. how'd ya like twenty four hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch with only the rotting corpses of your friends to keep you company?}

<A>__{they thought i was dead, so i played dead. they dumped all the bodies in a ditch. all i could do was lie there playing possum. dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me, listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after hour... as frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and the camera moves to sex machine. he's having a hot flash. he can't hear anything. he's looking at frost speaking, but he doesn't hear any sound. then he hears a deep, male voice say:}
<C>__{male voice }
<D>__{thirst.}
<A>__{"who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. he turns around: nobody's there. no one else in the group seems to hear it, a female voice seductively says:}

<C>__{frost}
<D>__{...and then when i came back to my senses, i realized i had killed the entire v.c. squadron single handedly. my bayonet had blood and chunks of yellow flesh on it like some cannibal shish kabob. and to this day i don't have the slightest idea how i }

<A>__{the survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. a lot of what they find is bullshit. pantyhose, coffee, teddy bears, etc. but a few of the boxes are just what the doctor ordered. cases from a sporting good supplier yield a shipment of baseball bats. meant to arrive at toy stores are a shipment of uzi replica squirt guns and a box of balloons. and captured en route to a hardware store are shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers. seth and scott saw the bats into wooden stakes. kate fills the uzi squirt guns with tap water from the backroom sink. jacob, with seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo. vampires all start converging on the back room door, getting their courage back. kate makes water balloons. scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. seth attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer. jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons, turning it into holy water. our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come. the back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes, begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side. the room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching, pounding, squeaking and screaming. finally they're ready. jacob turns to his kids.}

<D>__{before we go any further, i need you three to promise me something. i will fight with you to the bitter end, but when i turn into one of them, i won't be jacob anymore. i will be a lap dog of satan. i want you three to promise you'll take me down, no different from the rest.}

<L>__{interior barroom night}
<A>__{the vampires, bat things and what have you, start breaking down the door. they are in a mad frenzy. they burst through the door. waiting for them are scott and kate holding uzi squirt guns and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like grenades. jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. seth is holding the jackhammer. the survivors walk out of the back room into the bar. the vamps back up, letting them inside. what we have here is a mexican standoff, a la "the wild bunch." a moment of peace before the battle. the vamps just watch the humans. the humans just watch the vamps. then, like the bull in the china shop, seth ends the peace by starting up the jackhammer.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{kill 'em all!}
<A>__{jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react. the kids spray the crowd with uzi fire, burning vampire flesh. the pack of vamps retreat while the fuller squad walk forward. they are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards the door. seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in green vamp blood. jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand and shoots three vampires with blessed bullets with the other. flame bursts from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit. kate and scott both whip water balloons off their belts and toss them into the crowd. they burst and fry several of the vamps, who fall, screaming in pain. from its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat thing drops and hurls toward the group. jacob sees it, raises his gun and fires. the bat thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire. seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming the hammer stake into vampire chests. the front door is barricaded again by a big table and other junk.}

<A>__{seth tries to get to the front door, when sex machine, now a half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from above in front of him. seth rams the stake in its chest. the sex machine thing screams out, lifting the hammer and seth off the ground. seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room, he crashes into a table. the sex machine thing falls back with the jackhammer sticking out of his chest, dead. kate, spraying uzi fire like rambo, sees seth fall. she screams:}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{seth!}
<A>__{seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires on all sides. with no weapons, he puts up on dukes.}

<C>__{seth}
<D>__{anytime.}
<A>__{cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the bar. jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in fiery death. scott fires the uzi and chucks more water balloons. as jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. he can't hear anything. he wonders if he's gone deaf. he starts to hear the words: "thirst, thirst, thirst." he notices the vampires have stopped attacking him. they look at him wit happy smiles on their devilish faces. fangs begin to grow. his eyes are yellow. scott turns to his dad. he sees his father is a monster. jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, grabs scott and sinks his teeth into scott's forearm. scott screams bloody murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood. scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and smashes it against jacob's head. the holy water melts half of jacob's face away. he lets go of scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor. scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. he brings it up to fire. a totally evil jacob, with only half a face, matches stares with the boy he once called his son. scott's eyes turn to steel.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{i swear to god, in jesus christ's name.}
<A>__{he fires, sending a holy bullet into jacob's forehead, creating a hole from which fire shoots out. jacob's entire head bursts into flames, then explodes. from across the room, fate sees her daddy ignite. she cries out. in the thick of the battle, seth yells:}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{fight now, cry later.}
<A>__{kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face with a holy water balloon, which melts his head. a bat thing lands on the back of scott's neck. he screams as it bites into him. he drops the .45. kate sees scott get bit.}

<D>__{oh my god.}

<C>__{scott}
<D>__{kill me, kate!}
<A>__{kate runs for her brother, does a dive and a roll, coming up by the .45, snatching it in one motion and firing three times. one... two... three bat things are hit, shoot flames, then all of them explode, blowing up scott. the remaining vamps approach. all the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy balloon.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{how many bullets left, kid?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{not many.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. make 'em sing for their supper.}
<A>__{the two survivors are backed up against a wall. two bat things do a kamikaze dive from the air toward seth. seth throws the holy balloon at them. direct hit. the two bat things burst into flames and spiral to the floor. the two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before them. a moment of stillness before the attack. kate stands holding the .45, arm outstretched.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(to seth)}
<D>__{should i use the last bullets on us?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.}
<A>__{the vamps begins to close in. kate lines up the .45 sights on the face of an approaching vampire. seth holds the uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first vampire's head that gets in swinging distance. beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that kate shot through the wall. approaching vampires burn. the scorched vamps scream like they've never screamed before.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{shoot more holes!}
<A>__{kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall behind him, daylight comes through, providing kate and seth with a safe, lighted area. the .45's empty. the vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being able to get at them. the two survivors hold hands, when... all of a sudden the door to the titty twister is pounded on from the outside. the vamps look towards it in horror. from the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a spanish accent.}
<C>__{voice }
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{i'm looking for my friend. is seth in there?}

<D>__{danny, manny, knock down the door. hurry, hurry!}
<A>__{the vamps are totally fucking freaked out! they run and fly around the bar in a panic. crying, howling, grabbing onto each other. the front door is torn apart from shotgun fir coming from the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the door. the table in front of the door gives and falls forward. the door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. many vamps are instantly fried, bursting into flames. the mexican gangster carlso and his two henchmen, danny and manny, are horrified at what they see. they cross themselves in fright. vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. sunlight hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room. vamps try and dodge the beams. no dice. all around the vamps combust in fiery explosions. the titty twister is now on fire, burning out of control. seth and kate run through the building and leap through the door into the parking lot.}

<C>__{seth}
<D>__{have you ever been there before?}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{no, but i passed by it a couple of times. it's out in the middle of nowhere. it seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. and it's open from dusk till dawn. you said meet you in the morning.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. and this girl's family's dead.}
