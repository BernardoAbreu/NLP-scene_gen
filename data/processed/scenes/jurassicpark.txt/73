<L>__{int maintenance building }
<A>__{grant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building. he pushes past drums of herbicide, tree pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of cyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators, empty motor oil cans, work lights and cables.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{lex, i don't see any raft.}
<A>__{timmy looks at lex. where is it? lex doesn't know.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{keep going.}
<A>__{grant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe, piles of green mesh. two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{bullseye!}
<A>__{timmy is reliev ed. lex smiles.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{told you!}
<A>__{grant grabs them. looks around, still }
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{no raft. where did you see it, lex?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{actually, i never really saw one. just assumed.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{assumed?}
<A>__{she nods. grant and timmy resume looking. in the rear of the building lex walks below a barred window. slats of light fall on her back. she sees a dark closet door ajar. she brushes the handle. it swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall on her, knocking her to the ground. lex screams, frantically pushing the life preservers off. grant's head pops up. timmy runs to her side. she is wrestling irrationally with the life preservers. timmy drops to the ground.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{lex! lex! you're okay, you're okay!}
<A>__{lex is overcome with fear. timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on.}
<C>__{timm}
<B>__{y}
<D>__{look, lex! look!}
<A>__{she looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing. timmy laughs with her. grant joins them. he sits on a box and laughs.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i'm afraid there's no raft.}
<A>__{grant gets up. he reaches for the hands of the kids. timmy sees it the box grant sat on is labeled: raft storage. timmy smiles.. at the river's edge grant pulls a cord. with a loud hiss, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking and jumping like a wild marionette. then, with a whopping hiss whap! it pops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft. timmy and lex climb in, wearing the life preservers. grant gets in and pushes off with his oars. the small disturbance causes the cicadas to roar. the raft drifts out into the lagoon. grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks. grant surveys the river.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{looks pretty calm.}
<A>__{thump. the raft stops moving. they are aground. lex looks overboard. she reaches in about elbow deep. grant stands and puts the oars in the water. he pushes with all his might. there is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud floor. but it moves. and the raft goes into deep enough water. a general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream. a wide area of the river grant energetically works the oars. close on lex lets her hand trail in the water.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i will row, dr. grant.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{but he's sweating and takes a moment to rest. lex looks down at her hand in the water. it still trails.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{hey, we're still moving.}
<A>__{grant looks into the water. she's right.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{there's a current.}
<A>__{grant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes. the two kids look at him.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{you can't sleep.}
<C>__{grant}
<P>__{(eyes closed)}
<D>__{i'm not sl}
<A>__{eeping... yet.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i will do it!}
<A>__{lex picks up the oars and begins.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{we gotta warn them about the boat.}
<A>__{grant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky. he sighs and takes up the oars again. he rows powerfully with the current. a bend in the river current picks up speed. the water begins to rush and roar.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{cool!}
<A>__{white foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids. they burst out laughing. grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes. another bend now the raft is really racing. the kids hold on tightly as the raft is rocked. white water crashed over, drenching the kids. when grant takes a moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave. the raft tosses right and left. timmy holds the rubber grips. he's yanked to one side. he's knocked to the raft floor. quickly gets his grip again. shouts to grant.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{thought}
<A>__{is looked calm?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{guess i was wrong.}
<A>__{grant looks ahead. the river widens. the raft really starts to fly. lex, gripping very tightly, looks out. water sprays her again and again. her face is serious.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i can't swim!}
<A>__{grant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings. he lashes it around lex and timmy. then he ties it around one of the rubber grips.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{hold on real tight.}
<A>__{they go flying down the river. the roar deafens. the raft lifts out of the water. and crashes down, rocking every way. jagged rocks appear. grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the rocks and the rushing shoreline. the kids duck from sudden overhanging trees. grant looks ahead. he blanches. his pov the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall. they're almost there. at the huge waterfall, water rushes violently, heaving over the magnificent precipice. timmy tries to tighten l ex's vest but is thrown back down . he yells:}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{hold my hand. hold my hand when we go.}
<A>__{the raft spins in the rushing water. everyone is thrown around. the rope holding the kids to the raft tautens. the oars are wrestled out of grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge. at the last moment, grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade. with all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough. to let his hands smash into the overhanging branch. they stop right at the waterfall's edge. grant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch. but the water keeps rushing. his strength ebbs.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{don't let go!}
<A>__{grant's veins pop out in his arms. his hands start to slip off the wet tree bark. lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip. the rubber raft jumps and leaps below him. water pours into the raft. lex tries fruitlessly to let it out. timmy holds down grant's feet.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{you can do it!}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i'm trying. i'm trying ... ooooo!!! ....}
<A>__{his hands slipping, slipping ...}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{no!!!!!}
