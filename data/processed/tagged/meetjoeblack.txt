<A>__{a patch of water. pull back to reveal more water. back farther to reveal an expanse of river, up the bank to massive lawn running up to a great, classic hudson river manor house; the country estate of william parrish.}
<L>__{interior parrish country estate 4:00 am}
<A>__{move through french doors that lead from a wide terrace into an expansive living room, down wide corridors lined with bierstadt and cole paintings, the hudson river school, mists and trees and small boats and distant humans.}
<L>__{interior parrish bedroom 4:00 am}
<A>__{move through the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish ed with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping occupant, william parrish, 64, a warm but commanding face, a man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm. although asleep, there is an uncommon restlessness to him. parrish grips his upper arm as if in pain. now the severity of the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm. the wind comes up, through the wind a voice is heard distantly, or is it the wind itself:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{... yes.}
<A>__{parrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades, the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided. he rises now, crosses to the bathroom. as he pees, a breeze outside the window, the wind again, but then the voice comes up:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{yes...}
<A>__{it is unmistakably a voice, it is not the wind, parrish has heard something, he looks around, but no one is there. he can't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom. all beweild ered, parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed, trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't heard; he is not sure. he pulls the covers up now, not a sound, tries to close his eyes.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{parrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one there, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up, should he not, what is happening? he looks out: absolute stillness and silence, crickets chirp down by the river, a light flickers from a shadboat, parrish closes his eyes but then they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and finally, exhausted, falls back asleep.}
<L>__{exterior rear terrace, parrish country estate next morning}
<A>__{the great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms, speakers, lights. ubiquitous is allison, 35, parrish's older daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she relishing every moment. a painter approaches.}

<L>__{exterior great hall, country estate morning}
<A>__{parrish, groomed for the day, trots down the stairs, observ ing the activity outside through the windows. he checks his watch, strides down the hall, encounters may, 50, a family retainer who is opening the doors to the terrace as parrish passes.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what do you think of all this, may?}
<C>__{may}
<D>__{it's going to be beautiful. and miss allison says the president may come.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{oh, the president's got better things to do than come to my birthday party.}
<C>__{may}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{parrish grins, continues on, is intercepted by allison who, on catching sight of him, bounces in from the terrace.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{daddy!}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{hi, allison }
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{have you got a minute?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{not much more. big day in the big city. what's on your mind?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{fireworks. update we're con structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the state college at new paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a viking funeral with none of the morbidity... the hudson river authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation of course there'll be an overtime bill for the poughkeepsie fire dept...}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{allison, i trust you. this is your thing.}

<D>__{but it's your birthday.}

<A>__{the configuration of seats has drew beside parrish, in front of them quince and susan opposite each other in single seats. just as drew removes color coded folders from his attache case and spreads them out for parrish on his tray table, the pilot waves to drew, indicating 'phone call'. drew gets up and heads for the cockpit, parrish scans the folders, glances over at susan who is making some notes on a file of her own. he motions to her to please come sit beside him, she checks that drew is still busy in the cockpit, tucks her papers into her carryall, and crosses over to parrish who folds away the work that drew set before him into his tray table, locks it.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i thought you were in a meeting ?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i am. with you.}

<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{listen, i'm crazy about the guy he's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry parrish communications into the 21st century and me along with it.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{so what's wrong with that?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{that's for me. i'm talking about you. it's not so much what you say about drew, it's what you don't say.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you're not listening }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{oh yes, i am. not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.}

<D>__{well, it worries me. i want you to get swept away. i want you to levitate. i want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.}

<D>__{'be deliriously happy'. i'm going to do my upmost }
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. if you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? i say fall head over heels. find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. and how do you find him? forget your head and listen to your heart. i'm not hearing any heart.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back. because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this. to make the journey and not fall deeply in love well, you haven't lived a life at all. you have to try. because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.}

<L>__{interior parrish's office day}
<A>__{alone in his office, parrish's ebullient mood immediately changes. leaning against the back of the couch, he stares out through floor to ceiling windows, surveying the manhattan skyline: cogitates. he takes a seat on the couch, opens a folder, suddenly he flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder. it is sharp but brief, he notices it but what it does not continue, he ignores it. parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the pain comes again. he reaches for his shoulder, tries to massage the pain, it does not subside. parrish stands, trying to shake it off, but it refuses to go away, some thing is unmistakably wrong. now a sound which he has come to recognize, makes itself heard:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{frozen with surprise, parrish's eyes search the room for the source of the sound, it comes from no particular direction, yet surrounds him. suddenly parrish's symptoms sharply intensify, he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a corner of the desk, holds on with one hand, with the other clutches at his shoulder and arm, the pain has violently seized the upper part of his body. he breaks out in a sweat, his pallor now waxen as the voice repeats itself:}
<P>__{voice (v.o., cont'd)}
<D>__{...yes.}
<A>__{parrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him on the one hand, the voice coming at him from the outer, each aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself, consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a hallucination but which he is certain is not. parrish is possessed. he angles his face in every direction, arbi trarily chooses one and now embarrassedly, unconsciously, enrage, responds to the voice.}

<D>__{no, you're not. you're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.}

<D>__{it's enough now.}

<A>__{the voice is gone. parrish searches the corner, but the room has lost the quality it had when it was inhabited by the voice, it is now just parrish's office. faint squeals of traffic from the street, then a knock at the door. parrish touches his shoulder, the pain is gone, but he is still wet with sweat, the knock again. parrish straightens himself up, adjusts his tie, runs his fingers through his hair, blinks as he addresses the door.}

<A>__{parrish still doesn't answer, however jennifer is satisfied, correctly hearing his silence as an affirmative. she has her hand on the door, 'open' or 'closed'? he nods and she closes it. utter silence again. parrish's eyes search the room, nothing there.}

<D>__{no }

<L>__{interior guest room, parrish townhouse night}
<A>__{joe has been examining his room, full of curiosity and wonderment at the oddest things, the handle on a casement window, the hem and weight of the fabric of a drape, hinges on the bedroom door. in the process he opens this door, steps out into the hallway.}
<L>__{interior hallway, parrish townhouse night}
<A>__{joe wanders down the hallway past the occasional dufy or miro, a venetian tapestry cheek by jowl with a miniature ming vae, and even a bonsai garden with a trickling vein of water.}

<D>__{yes, sir?}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes, i am. i thoroughly enjoyed this uh peanut butter.}

<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}

<D>__{hand me one of those, will you?}
<A>__{joe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the spoonful of peanut butter, he shifts it to the other hand, can't manage the huge turkish towel one handed, now implants the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands and presents it to susan.}

<D>__{you must have something really big going on with my father }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{'big'?}
<C>__{susan}

<C>__{susan}
<D>__{not the one i met this morning, hit ting on me in as nice a way as i've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out i'm my dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.}

<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what are your intentions? to make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and i don't mind admitting it was turned, i liked it, but ten hours later i feel like a fool. i don't get it. you, my father, here in this house, the cof fee shop, it's making me upset, and i don't like being upset. who are you anyway? and what are you eating?}

<A>__{he finishes the spoonful.}

<D>__{but it's gone now.}
<A>__{he shifts the spoon from hand to hand, starts to stick it in his pocket, realizes this is inappropriate. susan holds her hand out to him, he places the spoon in it and she sets the spoon on the table with the towels. she watches, fascinat ed, as joe licks his gums, enjoying every last bit of his spoonful.}

<D>__{and what?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{and i won't tell anyone who you are.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{sounds fair enough.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{it is a deal?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{a 'deal'?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you give your word, i give mine that we'll do what we say. it's a truth exchanged between two people.}

<D>__{bill }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you've got a deal.}
<A>__{parrish seems relieved. he has now, with some difficulty, completed the tying of joe's tie, adjusts it beautifully on joe's collar, then spins him around in front of a mirror. joe, catching sight of his own appearance, rises to the balls of his feet, quite taken.}

<D>__{this is great!}

<D>__{now what do we do?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{shake hands.}

<A>__{parrish and joe striding downtown, joe's jacket fits per fectly, he blends right in and he clearly enjoys being part of the smart fifth avenue crowd on the way to work. parrish senses joe's pleasure, his slight preening, his eyes check ing out the good looking women headed for the offices at the top of corporate high rises.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you know, i got to thinking last night with you here, and seem ingly occupied, how's your work going uh elsewhere?}
<A>__{a flicker from joe. he has heard what parrish has said, his eyes busy with the grift and the sparkle of the avenue, but he is concentrating on parrish's words.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{when you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i guess so.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{so you understand the concept then. when you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{so you've grasped the idea. con gratulations. now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about.}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{not this.}
<A>__{they stride on, cutting through the crowd, joe all at home in his new surrounding, but parrish just the opposite, un characteristically uncomfortable, phrases forming on his lips but unspoken, then suddenly he blurts out:}

<P>__{(to the board)}

<A>__{parrish takes a moment, draws himself up to say something official then stops himself, what follows is spontaneous, reflective, deeply felt.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{umm i did enjoy or rather i was interested in meeting john yes terday impressive... i suppose... but it did get me to thinking. i started in this business because this is what i wanted to do. i knew i wasn't going to write the great american novel, but i also knew there was more to life than buying something for a dollar and selling it for two. i wanted to give the news to the world, and i wanted to give it unvarnished. the more we all know about each other, the greater the chance we will survive. sure, i want to make a profit, you can't exist without one but john bontecou is all profit. if we give him license to absorb parrish communications, and he has his eye on a few others after us, we'll be appointing him to the position he craves gatekeeper. in order to reach the world you will have to go through john bontecou. and not only will you have to pay him to do this, far more expensive, you'll have to agree with him. reporting the news is a privilege and a responsibility and it is not exploitable. parrish communications has earned this priv ilege, john bontecou wants to buy it. as your chairman, i urge you to agree this company is not for sale.}

<P>__{(to the board)}
<D>__{sorry. i know it looks like i'm reversing my field.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{that's your privilege, bill. but given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu ture, the truth is... joining john bontecou is every bit as certain as death and taxes.}

<D>__{'death and taxes'?}

<D>__{yes.}

<D>__{how nice for you both.}
<A>__{drew takes a moment, then plunges in.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{bill, pardon my candor, but i was confounded by your decision this morning.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i was hired, you told me, to help bring parrish communications into the 21st century. this merger is the vehicle }
<A>__{joe interrupts:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{perhaps a merger is a way to bring bill's company into the 21st cen tury. and perhaps it isn't. and perhaps cheating on your french philosophers exam at the groton school was an expedient way to get your diploma, and perhaps it wasn't. be that as it may, drew, a question can often be argued both ways.}
<A>__{drew is stunned.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{joe, cut it out. and you too, drew.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{i thought this was practically a done deal }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{well now it's undone, okay? forget bontecou! scrub him! i'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. i'm not going for it.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{drew heads for the door, turns around.}
<C>__{drew }
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{can i invite myself to dinner tonight?}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{susan and i had ticket for the knicks game. but she said you guys were getting together }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{dinner? absolutely.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{damn decent of you.}
<A>__{drew exits.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be. a man wants to leave something behind. and he wants it left behind the way he made it. and he wants it to be run the way he run it with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. okay?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{and i don't need your goddamn permis sion either! you! drew! i don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{easy, bill. you'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.}
<L>__{interior salon, parrish townhouse, new york city night}
<A>__{the skyline glitters through the terrace windows. the hour is before dinner, coyle and luisa weave seamlessly among the family, offering hors d'oeuvres and drinks on a tray. allison and susan together by a piano; parrish, quince and a distracted joe are gathered near the terrace. joe's eyes are on susan across the room. her eyes flicker towards him, aware of his gaze.}

<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{...we're never all together two nights in a row. maybe christmas, thanksgiving, that's it. what's going on?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{nothing's going on. maybe he doesn't want to be alone. he's go ing to be sixty five in a minute }
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{...i don't know, daddy seems funny to me. ever since joe showed. it's like he dropped from the clouds...}
<A>__{drew enters. he nuzzles susan's neck, out of the corner of her eye she sees joe still observing them.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{...when daddy walked in with him, he couldn't even remember his name. now he's his house guest. and you know how he hates house guests. what is going on?}

<P>__{(to susan and allison)}
<D>__{good question.}

<D>__{but i've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, i've got some great prospects i've developed. i want to talk to you about them next week.}

<C>__{drew}
<D>__{thanks, quince.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{never mind bontecou. i've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and i'm putting them to see old man.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{are you?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{we'll do it together. i will clue you in. timing's got to be right. the old man says it's up to joe.}

<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i thought you said 'be sorry for nothing'.}

<C>__{drew }
<D>__{do you want to hear it?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{well, i'm going to tell you anyway. i did cheat on that exam at groton. but so did twenty six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today. and i'm expecting you won't mention it again. i don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but i'm willing to pretend i did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones. but can i tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him. what are you, his shadow? do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak? you know some times somebody would like a few min utes alone with w.p. that means without you. okay, pal? let's eat.}
<L>__{interior dining room, parrish townhouse night}

<D>__{ i uh want to thank you all for coming uh my family }

<P>__{(a laugh)}
<D>__{yeah, speak for yourself.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{anyway i remember when you were little girls }
<A>__{an awkward pause. quince chooses to fill the silence.}

<D>__{i love little girls }
<A>__{allison elbows him.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{and now you're all grown up and i'm uh um }
<A>__{parrish struggles to keep his emotions in check, drew clocking his behavior very carefully.}

<P>__{(tentatively)}

<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{there is so much i would like to say but i can't }
<P>__{(another moment)}
<D>__{so i better sit down. carry on, everybody.}

<D>__{you bet.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{with bells on.}
<A>__{the guests try to return to their food, susan is the most concerned about parrish's lapse, she does not say anything but drew next to her senses her empathy and, in something of a display, gives her a pro forma hug. joe has observed every instant of drew's performance, his anxiety is palpable when coyle leans over to serve him, offering a tray of a roast that has been carved.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to coyle)}
<D>__{i would prefer some peanut butter.}

<A>__{joe tries to respond but he can't, his stammer interrupted by susan.}
<C>__{susan }

<D>__{yes. i'm tired.}

<D>__{that was wonderful.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{yeah, it's good to get together.}

<C>__{susan}
<D>__{raise away.}

<D>__{what is the nature of your interest in joe?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"? the nature of it's in there somewhere.}

<D>__{i won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{then what will you say?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't think this is the lightning you are looking for. drew's a good man. i know i didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but i've come to appreciate }

<D>__{now we love drew and joe in verbo ten? what's going on?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{when you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.}

<D>__{then what is it?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it's something.}
<A>__{she kisses him.}

<D>__{...i know you're all as uncomfor table as i am to be meeting without bill, but i got a call last night from john bontecou. not only is he still interested, he is sweetening his offer.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{although it pains me to say it, in my opinion bill parrish dealt with us peremptorily in dismissing any deal with bontecou. therefore, i'm sorry to say that if we are to exam ine this new offer responsibly as the board of directors of parrish communications, we must do so with out its chairman.}
<P>__{(another moment)}
<D>__{oh yes, there is one additional element: bontecou is so anxious to get us, he said he'd take parrish communications with our chairman or without.}
<A>__{the board falls silent. sloane, a peer of parrish's, fidgets. drew milks the moment.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{it's no surprise if i suggest to you that the bill parrish we know is not the bill parrish you saw yesterday. you heard that speech some strange emotional rationale to buttress a knee jerk rejection of a legitimate offer. does it not strike you that something is possibly affecting this man's judgement? more specifically his judgement to make a critical business decision?}
<A>__{silence, the board clocking drew's argument.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{it's not pleasant to say the follow ing, but i would be remiss, in this crisis, if i did not. when we pre sent bill with the improved bontecou offer, and if he refuses to let us consider it once more makes an adamant or emotional rejection we will have no choice but to seek an alternative.}

<D>__{and what would that be?}

<D>__{how did this all come about? crisis bill parrish, crisis his com pany, crisis for us. i came about with the arrival on the scene of mr. joe black. mr. joe who? joe black. he attends our board meet int, he sleeps at bill's house, re sides in his office. never leaves his side. and, in my opinion, is always in his ear. telling him what to do and bill is listening. who is joe black? what is his relationship to bill parrish? and most important, what is behind his influence on our chairman?}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{you're building this thing up too much, drew. he's had advisors be fore. nobody tells bill what to do.}
<A>__{the door opens and felicia enters followed by quince, sur prised at seeing a convened board, but still he is all smiles.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{thank you for coming.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{hello, quince.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{hi, ed, hi folks, i didn't know everybody was going to be here, what a nice surprise. what's the big confab?}
<C>__{sloane}
<P>__{(acidly)}
<D>__{this is a secret meeting.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to quince)}
<D>__{i hope you'll respect its nature what we're trying to do here is gather our thoughts in light of bill's rejection of bontecou's offer and make an appropriate presenta tion to him as to how we think the company might proceed. won't you share with our board the information you gave me last night?}
<A>__{quince hesitates, then realizes what drew has on his mind. he nods confidently to drew, then turns importantly to the board.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{well, i'm happy to tell you i've got good news. as i was telling drew, i've been making a little hay while the bontecou sun was shining two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{how did bill react to the leads you've developed?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{he was interested.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(prompting)}
<D>__{ but he was concerned about the timing?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{the timing yes. he says it's up to joe.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{'it's up to joe'?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{that's what he said.}
<A>__{quince, having dispensed his information, looks proudly around at the board members. they are stunned, sloane in shock. drew is absolutely still, letting quince's words sink in.}
<L>__{interior dining room, parrish townhouse night}
<A>__{parrish, joe, susan, allison and quince are seated at the table, dessert plates in front of them, coffee cups beside. allison and susan's eyes are on parrish, looking for some clue as to why has he gathered the family together yet again. parrish is somewhat within himself, but he peeks over his demi tasse cup at joe, parrish aware of joe's heightened interest in susan, and susan's reciprocation. coyle enters carrying two imposing stemmed silver trays with cakes on them, luisa follows with one other. they set them down in front of parrish.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{annie made them.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{who's annie?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{from la rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in america.}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{this is orange, from real seville oranges. lemon, on a mille feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. and a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't like cake.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{it's for the party, dad }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{oh, the goddam party }
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{'goddam party'!}
<A>__{allison bursts into tears.}
<C>__{allison }
<P>__{(to quince)}
<D>__{did you hear that?}
<A>__{quince quickly slashes a piece, takes a huge bite.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{this is great, honey. the orange. has it got a little vodka in it? like that finnish stuff, orange vodka }
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{put your lips around this one, bill. it's out of this world.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{no thank you, quince.}
<P>__{(to allison)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, honey. i'm no good at this. why don't you choose whatever cake you like?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{i knew you were going to say that. tito puente. the old platoon. now the cake. you just don't care. why did i do this? i should have my head examined. i'm trying to throw the party for the century for my father and you know what he doesn't give a shit.}
<A>__{she bursts into tears all over again.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{but he does give a shit. don't you, bill?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{yeah, i give a shit.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{see. there. what'd i tell you?}
<A>__{joe watches as quince dabs at allison's tears with a napkin.}
<C>__{quince }
<D>__{feel better?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{yeah, but }
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{but what?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{what will i tell annie?}
<A>__{parrish forks a bit of a cake.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{this one.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{the vodka. what'd i tell you?}
<A>__{quince puts a reassuring arm around allison, she seems to relax now, joe has been a keen observer of what has trans pired between husband and wife, between man and woman, a sense that he has taken in the virtue of such a relation ship.}
<L>__{interior salon, parrish townhouse night}
<A>__{after dinner, parrish, allison and susan are gathered to gether. at the bar on the other side of the room, joe watches as quince pours himself a stiff hooker of brandy.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to quince)}
<D>__{cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult western males.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{i didn't know that.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{on the other hand, winston churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety one.}
<A>__{after a moment.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{you're an original, joe. a little hard to figure, maybe...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{and you're a nice man, quince.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{drew appears unannounced in the doorway, exchanges a tense glance with susan, then heads straight for parrish who seems surprised to see him.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{sorry to intrude, bill, but we've got a bit of a crisis downtown it's not something we could talk about on the phone.}
<A>__{parrish takes drew aside.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{the board's real unhappy, pappy they felt you dealt with them pre emptorily, you never gave them a chance to speak }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what is there to say? they know what john bontecou is and if they didn't, they know now.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{yes, you made your feeling abun dantly clear. now they want to do the same with theirs.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what are their feelings?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{if i read this board right now, they want you to accept bontecou's offer.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{over my dead body.}
<A>__{parrish's burgeoning anger has now gotten the attention of joe, susan, quince and allison.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{what do you think the board is going to say when i tell them that?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{with all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.}
<A>__{silence, parrish carefully calibrating drew's remark.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{whose?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{yours.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i'm just giving you the truth. there was a time when william parrish liked the truth.}
<A>__{joe, although across the room, is all attention.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i think it's time you went home, drew.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{certainly. goodnight.}
<A>__{drew goes, everybody is in shock, susan pursues him out into the hallway.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{drew!}
<A>__{he stops.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{never talk to my father like that again.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{don't worry about it. there's a beginning and a middle and an end to everything. and i think i've come to the end of my chapter with the parrishes.}
<A>__{joe has followed them into the hallway.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{and the end began with this guy.}
<A>__{drew looks down towards joe.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{mr. black ? we ran a check on you and you know what we came up with?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no, i don't }
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{not good, not bad, you know what we got? nothing. no credit, no cars, no mortgages no wives. nothing.}
<A>__{joe waits.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{all of a sudden a guy appears on the scene with the chairman of one of the greatest communications corpora tions of the world, the boss makes him privy to all the company's secrets, he attends the board meet ings, and us working stiffs with mba's up the ass and years and years and years of experience, we're left outside with our noses pressed against the window.}
<A>__{joe doesn't respond.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{this is a big time operation, deal ing in big time issues, demanding big time executives who make big time decisions. so, joe, why don't you tell me exactly what it is that's big time about you?}
<A>__{after a moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you first.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(to drew)}
<D>__{why don't you get off his case?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{oh, you're the great joe's attorney now? are we going to go to court? or are we going to go to bed? and i don't mean you and me. i mean you and him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{that's it. it's over. get out.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{so i guess a blowjob's out of the question?}
<A>__{joe clears his throat.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{did you say something?}
<A>__{joe considers him evenly.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{almost.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(to drew)}
<D>__{i said get out.}
<A>__{now drew wheels, heads right for the front door and exits with a slam.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what an angry fellow.}
<A>__{a moment passes before susan realizes she and joe are alone, and joe does as well.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm sorry about }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{please. we don't need to talk about drew.}
<A>__{she regards joe.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no. we don't.}
<A>__{they drift, osmotically, into the library in awkward silence.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{brave you had a chance to look at dad's rare books? jefferson's parliamentary manual, a first edition bleak house }
<A>__{joe comes closer, takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i love your smell.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{ i guess you haven't.}
<A>__{now susan, close to joe, leans closer, her nose in joe's neck. joe holds himself very still.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{i like your smell, too.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it was everything.}
<A>__{silence, the ticking of the clock.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{when i was little, my mother used to say, "darling, you could set your heart by this clock".}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ could you?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{never tried, 'til now.}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{joe, may i kiss you?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{why, yes. thank you.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{susan reaches out for joe, they kiss, he is awkward but his very awkwardness endearing. susan pulls him closer, they linger now, mouths on each other's, then separate.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{the clock ticks on. a sense of foreboding falls over joe's face, his fear that he is passing through some barrier, a point of no return.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{joe?}
<A>__{the apprehensive expression on joe's face fades away.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i don't know who you are.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well...i'm uh, joe. and you're susan. and i uh have this weak feeling in my knees }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{and is your heart beating strangely?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{faster. and i want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me forever.}
<A>__{an intake of breath. she is about to speak.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{and you don't even have to say a word.}
<A>__{their faces inches from each other's.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i have to go home.}
<A>__{but neither susan nor joe moves.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{don't i?}
<A>__{her question makes joe, almost involuntarily, smile. susan takes the opportunity to step back from him. the sound of someone at the door, it is parrish, susan turns, comprehends immediately how the situation will appear to him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{goodnight, daddy.}
<A>__{she drifts right past him, exits. joe and parrish are left alone now, eyes on each other's.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{hello, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{hello. would you like to join me, quince and allison for a nightcap?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{um not right now.}
<A>__{an awkward moment.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{okay. goodnight.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<A>__{parrish turns and exits, joe's head inclines, he breathes in the scent of his collar.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior executive suite, parrish communications next day}
<A>__{parrish, followed by joe, emerges from his private elevator, is greeted as usual:}
<C>__{jenifer}
<D>__{good morning, mr. parrish.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{good morning, jennifer.}
<C>__{jenifer}
<D>__{the board is waiting.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jenifer}
<D>__{didn't you call a board meeting?}
<A>__{jennifer sees parrish is trying to right his balance, she knows better than to press the pointerior}
<C>__{jenifer }
<D>__{yes, the members are waiting. they are in the board room now.}
<A>__{jennifer nods respectfully as parrish doesn't cast a flicker of any further surprise, heads straight for the board room, joe right beside him.}
<L>__{interior board room, parrish communications day}
<A>__{parrish and joe enter, the entire board is assembled, includ ing drew, quince and sloane.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{an odd mixture of responses, the board sheepish and at the same time looking their most dutiful at this odd meeting, its sudden convening clearly a problem for parrish, a prob lem which he does not attempt to hide, only control.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, bill?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't think so. do you?}
<A>__{drew gets the message, at the same time joe is checking out all the attendees, his eyes come to rest on drew.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{to get to the point, we have re ceived new information from john bontecou concerning his desires for this company to merge with his, and we wanted to set the details before you.}
<A>__{a moment as parrish looks around, the moment extends, it appears he may not ever answer.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{bontecou wants a quick response and }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{the answer is no, quick enough for you?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{don't you want to hear the details?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i'm not interested in the details. and i'm not interested in the big picture either. what i am inter ersted in is how my board got conven ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and i am expected to clap for it like a performing seal. no, thank you.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{so i am to understand from your re sponse that you do not want to hear the details of bontecou's offer?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{yes, you are to understand that, and now may i ask you a question?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{certainly, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{are you running this board or am i?}
<A>__{sloane leans in.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{we're not getting anywhere here. why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week }
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{bontecou wants a speedier response than that.}
<C>__{sloane}
<D>__{he'll wait }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{doesn't need to. today, tomorrow, a week from now 'a week from now', who can think about a week from now the answer is going to be the same a loud, unmistakable, all inclusive, airtight 'no'.}
<A>__{a buzz amongst the board, they finally rustle into silence under parrish's withering glance.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{that's it? i've got a busy day and this meeting has already set me behind. shall we adjourn?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{before we do, while we're here, there is a second question the board would like a response to, a far simpler one.}
<A>__{parrish waits.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{who is the man sitting to the right of you?}
<A>__{everybody's eyes are on joe.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i've already introduced mr. black to you all.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{but who is he? what are his creden tials? what is his relationship to you?}
<A>__{no response from parrish.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{the feeling of the board is this: we fear mr. black is not only influenc ing your decisions in regard to this company, but that you are relying on him to make them for you.}
<A>__{quince flinches at these words, his hands clasped in front of him, his knuckles white as parrish regards drew, but still does not answer.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{the lack of response, bill, is not appropriate. we are your board, we have a right to know how you are managing the operations of this company, and most importantly, that you have not delegated someone to do it for you.}
<A>__{parrish squirms, desperately uncomfortable but still does not speak.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{okay, one more time.}
<A>__{drew regards joe.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{who is joe black?}
<A>__{parrish stares stoically into the middle distance as quince's head sinks into his hands.}
<C>__{drew }
<P>__{(to the board)}
<D>__{a motion has been brought before the board to invoke article 19 of the corporate charter.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{in english, please.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{mandatory retirement upon our chairman's sixty fifth birthday.}
<A>__{parrish is expressionless.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{at which time, the chairman will be named emeritus, he will be welcome to attend all meetings, and will serve as international spokesman for the corporation plus, of course, a settlement, a golden parachute of such magnitude that his feet will never touch the ground.}
<A>__{drew pauses.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{please indicate your vote by a "yes" or "no".}
<A>__{a "yes" is heard, now another "yes", now more "yes"es, all reluctant, "no" from sloane, "no" from quince who realizes he is the instrument of parrish's dismissal.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{the motion is passed. we will of course delay the announcement, out of respect for our former chairman, until after the celebration of his birthday this weekend.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{thank you for allowing me to save face, drew.}
<A>__{joe's eyes are riveted on drew.}

<C>__{drew}
<D>__{that we did. thanks to you. he was wobbling, mind you, but you stupid the coup de grace.}

<A>__{quince is struck dumb.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{don't you know what this'll mean? you'll be rich. you'll sell your stock, you can stop kissing ass what'll it feel like to be a man?}

<D>__{you're here?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i am.}
<A>__{he stands, they regard each other for the moment.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{may i take your coat?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer, starts to take off the coat herself, joe comes around her to help, susan senses him breathing in the scent at the back of her neck.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i just thought i'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, i was in the neigh borhood }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{how beautiful.}
<A>__{he starts to hang susan's coat up.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{just throw it on the chair.}
<A>__{joe holds her coat carefully on the chair. an awkward moment, the two of them shifting from foot to foot.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{when i called, they said that you and daddy had just left the office.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{he's taking a nap.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{he must be tired this bontecou thing }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes, he's tired. i believe so.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{you must be hungry?}
<A>__{susan sits on the couch.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no, not anymore. are you?}
<A>__{joe hears the question but doesn't answer, sits down on the couch beside her.}
<C>__{susan }
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{are you cold?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{...no.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{maybe it's the draft through the door.}
<A>__{she gets up, closes the door, sits back down again next to joe. a warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each other, now they fall into a foreplay which susan recognizes as such, joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily but has no knowledge where it is leading. his movements are instinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin gers, odd things about her seem to interest him. this excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the very sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each other are intuitive and spontaneous; even though joe has no know ledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his actions are such that they never beg the question has he done it before. strange territory for joe, not to be 'in control' and exert ing his power, but his inventions and responses in lovemak ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and susan builds. joe has found himself in an unexplored land of feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and yet at the same time, is terrified by it. he feels himself being lured by some power he has not only never been aware of, but is deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is doing is putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on. the powerful contradiction is transmitted to susan, and in the end there is the knowledge they have together made a journey, they both have been swept away in a stream of events they have created; and they don't care about the consequences. spent, they lie in silence. finally susan speaks:}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it's so wonderful to make love to you. it's like making love to some one who has never made love before.}
<A>__{joe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she has said, but to tell her more, even the truth about himself. he weighs, then resists, the impulse.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{her head nestles underneath his arm, she has a sense of his comforting her without knowing that he is doing so.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{did you like making love to me?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i loved it.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{more than you love peanut butter?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{she laughs at the earnestness with which he answers. joe seems to drift away now, they lie together as one but for the first time, she feels separate from him, sensing him gone to some distant, distant land.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{nowhere? i'm...here.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{for how long?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh, i hope a long, long time.}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{hello, bill.}

<D>__{did you have a nice nap?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i couldn't sleep.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm sorry to hear that.}
<A>__{he starts up the stairs.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{no, i will come down}
<A>__{joe waits guardedly at the bottom of the stairs as parrish descends.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{what's going on?}
<A>__{joe senses parrish's tone, doesn't answer.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{i saw you kiss susan.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes, i saw you see me.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.}

<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{well, you goddam well should. you walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{'spooning'?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{yes, and stop repeating everything i sai, and turning it into a question. spooning, fooling around, god knows what. you arrive on the scene why you picked me, i still don't under stand }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to how shall i say instruct. you've lived a first rate life. and i find it eminently usable.}
<A>__{parrish measures joe.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<A>__{joe doesn't answer, riveted now on parrish.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{everybody wants something, joe. you've been taking me from pillar to post here. i thought i knew who you were, and it wasn't a whole lot of fun, however it was almost bear able. now i'm getting something else from you, something very, very strange what is it that you want, joe?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm only following the parrish bywords. looking for that 'ounce of excitement', that 'whisper of a thrill' what there is no sense living your life without. you know what i mean, bill.}
<A>__{parrish's jaw sets.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you're violating the laws of the universe.}

<D>__{any universe that exists or ever existed. you may be the pro, joe. but i know who you are. and you're all fucked up.}

<D>__{how did you meet?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{i was a world class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl and for some reason she took me in.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{but she loves you?}
<A>__{quince smiles, nods embarrassedly.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. i mean the deeper, darkest secrets they don't matter.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{'the deepest, darkest secrets '?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls and then you're free.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what do you mean 'free'?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{free to love each other. com pletely. totally. no fear.}
<A>__{quince seems uncharacteristically within himself.}
<C>__{quince }
<D>__{all that hoopla up there reminds me how i will never measure up to a man like bill parrish or his daughter.}
<A>__{he drains his wine.}
<C>__{quince }
<D>__{do you like me, joe?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh yes, you are one of my favorites.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{what would you say if you knew it was me who brought down bill parrish?}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{i told drew and the board that bill depended on you. drew led me on, but i had no business telling him in the first place. he was setting up bill from day one. drew and bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. bontecou was outside, drew was mr. inside. and i was the fool who made it all happen. oh god, what do i do?}
<A>__{joe regards quince.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{go to bill parrish and tell him everything. he'll forgive you.}
<A>__{quince drains one more glass of wine.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{you think so? how do you know?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{because that's the kind of man bill parrish is.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{well, maybe... i guess you know him better than anybody.}
<A>__{another moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ getting to.}
<A>__{the orchestra behind them plays a few riffs, sound checks, getting close.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{do you think i should wait to tell him 'till after the party?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{quince nods anxiously, then smiles gratefully. they look on as the pre party activities swirl on around them.}
<L>__{exterior front entrance, country estate sunset (later)}
<A>__{the moment just before sunset, the last pre party minutes, a procession of guests' cars winding up to the guest house, being directed into adjacent fields. susan cuts past a re ceiving line that files up the stairs, she skirts the house and heads straight for the action, the party on the lawns in the rear, climbs a terrace where she commands a view of the event on which the curtain is just about to rise.}
<L>__{exterior lawn, country estate sunset}
<A>__{guests milling, emerging from the crowd susan sees, isolated by a fountain, joe. he looks up towards her, he knows she has seen him, they proceed to a rendezvous that has not been prearranged but which they intuit. susan slants through the guests, stopping here and there, excited greetings and cha tter float on the wind, "he, susie!", "what a party", "you look great", she keeps moving, a shimmering wraith. joe is on the right coordinate to meet her, his graceful, unfailing step carrying him speedily to a destination he is not certain of, but where he knows he will find susan.}
<L>__{exterior garden, country estate sunset}
<A>__{the very last rays of the sun setting over the wide expanse of river, the light catching susan and joe as they enter the garden, the party forming behind them, the river flowing in front of them.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i like you in a black tie.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i love you in an evening gown.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it beats a surgical, doesn't it?}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{daddy told me you might be leaving?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes. your father and i, our time together has come to an end.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<A>__{joe attempts to answer, but nothing comes out.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{you won't tell me?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well i }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{and you can't tell me who you are.}
<A>__{again the same indescribable gesture from joe.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{i'm in love with a man, i don't know who he is, where he's going or when.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i can tell you the when part. tonight.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it gets worse.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no worse than it gets for me. i'm in love with a woman whom i don't want to leave.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{then don't.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{we know so little about each other }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{we know all that we need to know }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{but there's so much to tell you }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{don't. that will come later.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{will it?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{lightning struck. we caught it in a bottle. don't let it out. i want to be with you, joe }
<A>__{another moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what will we do?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{'love will find out the way'.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{'love will find out the way'?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it's a saying.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i believe that, don't you?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{yes, that's why i said it.}
<A>__{they are on the brink of some decision, joe is about to make some declaration when allison is heard }
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{there you are!}
<A>__{allison appears.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{what's going on here? tete a tetes on my big night?}
<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{c'mon honey, you're needed.}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{can it wait?}
<A>__{but before he can answer }
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{glad to hear it!}
<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{she takes susan's arm and marches her off, joe, in thrall, watches them go as the music erupts behind them, as 'up' dance tune, a lilting, catchy melody envelops them all. the curtain has risen on william parrish's 65th birthday party.}
<L>__{interior parrish's study, country estate night}
<A>__{quince is "on the carpet", sweating through a confession, parrish moroses but philosophical at his desk.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{...what can i say after i say that i'm sorry? i zipped when i should've zagged, i opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{it's okay, quince. i understand. you've always meant well and i appreciate that. sometimes things just turn out wrong.}
<A>__{a knock on the door, it opens, joe appears.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{excuse me }
<A>__{he starts to step out.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{come in, joe i want to thank you okay, bill?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{as joe enters, quince flashes a warm smile at him.}
<C>__{quince}
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{joe knew the whole story. i told him. it was his idea that i come clean. i mean i wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what i mean?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{yes, i believe i do.}
<A>__{quince now drifts off.}
<C>__{quiche}
<D>__{yeah, well i can tell you guys got business }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{no, i'm out of business, right, quince? however i do have some unfinished business with drew. get him out here. get him on the chopper and get him out here to night. i want to tell this guy how i feel about him face to face.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{oh, that could be a tall order, b.p. i doubt that drew's anxious to see you face to face.}
<A>__{joe steps in.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to quince)}
<D>__{tell drew that bill acknowledges that this was a contest and he's lost. the race is to the swift, but could drew summon a modicum of understanding and allow bill to save face. tell him bill wants it understood in the business community he has merely moved upstairs in his own company, and the executive continuity is unbroken. tonight's the night to do it. he'll introduce drew to his press friends as well as some of his close acquaintances from washington and drew can tell them that everything's sailing along just fine.}
<A>__{parrish is impressed by joe's acumen, a look of grudging admiration. he nods to joe, summarizes:}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(to quince)}
<D>__{all in all, what bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to drew with no hard feelings.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{you think drew will go for it?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{quince, i've got confidence in you.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{sir, i will deliver the package.}
<A>__{he heads out, parrish and joe fall silent.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{not at all.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{how are you doing?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what the hell do you care?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i was just asking, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you 'want to know', i will tell you. you're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the valley of the shadow of death, he's galloping into it. and the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates. and, oh yes, i almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with death.}
<A>__{another moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ and i'm in love with your daughter.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{say again?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm in love with your daughter, and i'm taking her with me tonight.}
<A>__{parrish is stunned.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you're what?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i think you heard me, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you're not taking susan anywhere. and what the hell does that mean anyway?}
<A>__{joe doesn't answer for a moment.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{i thought we had a deal.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm sorry, bill }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry? well, i'm sorry, apology not accepted.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i love her, bill. she is all that i ever wanted, and i've never wanted for anything because i've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{how perfect for you to take whatever you want because it pleases you. it's not love }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{then what is it?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in dulging. it's missing everything that matters.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{which is what?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them. and above all, not hurting the object of your love.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{so that's what love is?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{those were my words, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{well, they're mine now.}
<A>__{joe is silent for a moment, cogitating.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{susan wants to come. she says she's in love with me.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{with you?! who is 'you'? did you tell her who you are?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{does she know where she's going?}
<A>__{joe doesn't answer.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{susan went, in whatever way she did, for that poor sonofabitch whose body you took, and everything else since has been aftermath. you say you love her but you don't know what love is. she 'loves' you but she doesn't know who you are. you make a deal, you're breaking it the bottom line is, joe, you're conducting a great romance under false pretenses.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i don't like what you're saying.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't expect you to.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{are you threatening me?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i certainly hope so i loved susan from the moment she was born, and i love her now, and every minute in between, and what i dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.}
<A>__{parrish is beginning to reach joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{are you telling me i can't be part of it?}
<A>__{a pause, parrish's posture changes.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{why did you come in here and tell me, joe? you are the biggest shot of all, you don't have to ask my permission, but that's what you're doing. you know why? because you've somewhere, somehow, developed into a good guy, and you know this is all wrong... i don't know what you're going to do how can this be love? she doesn't know who you are. why don't you tell her? try it out on her? see what happens. reveal everything there is to know about yourself and let the chips fall where they may.}
<A>__{joe has received what parrish has said.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{okay? i've given it my best shot. i wish i could tell you to sleep on it but...}
<A>__{parrish lets his words drift into silence, he shrugs, joe regards him.}
<L>__{exterior lawns, country estate night}
<A>__{joe makes his way down the path from parrish's study, a weight on his shoulders, his step measured, within himself until he is hit by the lights and laughter and music of the party. he drifts into the center and runs right into susan, couples swirl about them, the eye of a storm of gaiety.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{hello, joe. what'd you know?}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{there's something so indescribably sexy about you in a crowd. i could make love to you right here.}
<A>__{he hesitates, reaches out to take her hand, studies it.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{if you're going to tell my future, you're on the wrong side.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{there is something i do want to tell you }
<A>__{he stammers into silence.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{but you can't.}
<A>__{joe is about to respond but doesn't.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{just then when you hesitated the way you shift from foot to foot, i've always found endearing but just now i got a chill.}
<A>__{but he drifts again, now she takes his hand.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{remember that morning in the coffee shop? you said 'what's wrong with taking care of a woman, she takes care of you "}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{did i say that?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{and i said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.}
<A>__{joe shifts, she smiles at his embarrasement.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{well, you've found one, joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{the 'coffee shop' }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{ that was the place... and you were the guy.}
<A>__{joe seems resigned now, the air gone out of him.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{and you said you didn't want me to be your doctor because you didn't want me to examine you ?}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{well, i got to examine you after all }
<A>__{joe blinks, at a loss.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{i could come with you }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i uh }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you want me to wait for you, you'll be back }
<A>__{joe doesn't answer, susan is suddenly anxious.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{why do i want this night to last forever?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{don't you know, that's what i want more than anything.}
<A>__{he touches her face.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you said before you couldn't tell me who or where, only the 'when' is when now?}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{may i kiss you?}
<A>__{she waits. he kisses her, they fall into a deep embrace.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{that felt like a goodbye.}
<A>__{joe's silence is heavy.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{what's going on, joe? i feel like we're lifting off }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm still here.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{but you're not. you're somewhere else.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{you're someone else }
<A>__{joe is struggling with a response, finally, inevitably, he drifts into a long silence. susan is beside herself, her emotions tossed in every direction, joe steadies her.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{tell me you love me tell me you love me now }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i love you now, i will love you always }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{hold me }
<A>__{he holds on tight to her. they are desperately entwined until finally she releases him.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{susan }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{ yes?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{thank you for loving me.}
<A>__{she smiles wanly, joe leaves her.}
<L>__{interior parrish's study, country estate night}
<A>__{parrish is seated by the window, lights from the party flashing past, the music and laughter audible but muted, the fever of the celebration lost on him, within himself. joe enters, parrish looks up.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{...we should think about getting started, bill.}
<A>__{parrish waits.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{it'll just be us.}
<A>__{the tension in parrish's body releases, he takes a breath.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{joe nods an acknowledgement, but his face reflects his pain. parrish regards him sympathetically. the silence is broken by a knock on the door. parrish, out of politeness to joe, does not respond.}
<C>__{quince }
<D>__{bill ?}
<A>__{after a moment.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{quince appears, flushed with excitement.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{ i got him. the chopper's two minutes away.}
<A>__{parrish weighs the information for a moment.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{how are we on time?}
<A>__{joe shrugs, nods gently.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(to quince)}
<D>__{get him in here.}
<A>__{quince exits, parrish presses the button for the speaker phone.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{...may? i know you're busy, but i want you to put in a call to eddie sloane for me }
<C>__{may }
<D>__{at home, sir ?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{no, he's at the office.}
<L>__{exterior lawns, country estate night}
<A>__{an area on the fringe of the party, the helicopter blades stop spinning. quince hurries to the aircraft door, opens it and drew steps out. quince leads the way through the lights and music. drew, fashioning an imperial entrance for himself, hails partygoers as he passes, quince enjoying the irony.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{this is damn big of bill, i also think it's smart.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{he had no choice. you're a formidable adversary.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{he said that?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{well, you've got him by the short hairs.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{yeah, the short, gray hairs.}
<A>__{he flashes a pleased as punch greeting to some unseen acquaintance as they press on to parrish's study.}
<L>__{interior parrish's study, country estate night}
<A>__{parrish is at his desk, joe in a distant corner of the room.}
<C>__{sloane }
<P>__{(speakerphone)}
<D>__{we're all here, bill }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i appreciate this, eddie, members of the board, this will just take a minute of your time. as the custo dians of the company, you may re ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you }

<P>__{(speakerphone)}
<D>__{we're all ears.}

<C>__{drew}
<D>__{hi, bill, happy birthday }
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{i just wanted to say how appre ciative i am of this uh grand gesture and }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{shut up and sit down.}
<A>__{drew takes a seat.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{you're a worthless sack of shit, you fucked me over, played footsie with john bontecou, sold my company out to line your own pockets.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i don't know where you get that idea the board agreed }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{the board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{is this mr. black's fantasy? another one of his whoppers? aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? no one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.}
<A>__{joe can no longer control himself.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you're the poison, drew. you've operated behind the scenes to suborn the trust of a man who has stamped you with his imprimatur of class and elegance and stature. i've seen all kinds and degrees of deception in my time, but bill parrish has been on the receiving end of machinations so machiavellian that it has rarely been my experience to encounter. and yet he has combatted them stoically, and selflessly, without revealing my identity. had he violated the vow of secrecy he took, his task would have been far easier, he could have turned defeat into victory, but he is too honorable a man to have done that. and now i must release him from that vow. because of me, he has lost his work, his company, his reputation and now he's going to tell you who i am.}
<A>__{parrish is struck dumb. he looks at joe pleadingly, shaking his head imperceptibly, but joe nods to him blithely and then commandingly.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{so tell me, tell me, i'm peeing in my pants.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ and now you're going to pee some more.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{joe, don't do this }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it's time to put this person where he belongs.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{it's not necessary, joe. drew's going to step aside }
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i'm not stepping anywhere }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i appreciate your gentlemanliness, bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home }
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{the dagger ?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i told you to shut up.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to drew)}
<D>__{prepare yourself, drew i am }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{he is }
<C>__{joe}

<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{the treasury department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of john bontecou. they were convinced that bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for. the irs wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{i agreed to cooperate.}

<D>__{and we're very grateful.}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{undisclosed conflict of interest }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{an offense }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{an indictable offense.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i think i'd like to talk to my lawyer }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{no lawyers, drew. we're going to offer you a deal.}
<A>__{drew is all attention.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{confess to the board every details of your participation and then submit your resignation.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{and what do i get?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you get not to go to jail.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you're talking through your hat. you're offering a deal because you've got no proof.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{proof? we've got plenty of proof.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to drew)}
<D>__{and he's talking through his lips.}
<A>__{joe steps forward.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{make no mistake, drew, if you choose to test my resolve in this matter, you'll be looking at an outcome that will have a finality that is beyond your comprehension, and you'll not be counting the days or the months or the years, but millenniums in the house with no doors.}
<A>__{drew slumps.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{all right, you win. as soon as i get back to the city, i will meet with the board.}
<A>__{sloane's voice erupts over the speakerphone.}
<C>__{sloane }
<D>__{you're meeting with the board right now, drew. resignation accepted. moreover, i propose a motion to re confirm william parrish as chairman of the board of parrish communica tions as well as a rejection of the merger with bontecou international. how say you, board?}
<A>__{a chorus of thunderous "yes"es resounds through the}
<B>__{speakerphone.}
<P>__{sloane (o.s., cont'd)}
<D>__{the motion is passed.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than i bargained for. i just wanted to set the record straight.}
<C>__{sloane }
<D>__{but we want you back, bill. mean while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. and mr. black, may we say thank you.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{my pleasure. this is an irs agent's dream. i will be promoted to chief of section off of this.}
<A>__{parrish clicks the speakerphone off. drew is staring at joe, shaking his head.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{who would've ever believed it? you, an irs agent }
<A>__{silence. joe shrugs, smiles.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{'death and taxes'.}
<A>__{the door flies open, an anxious allison appears.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{daddy! we've been looking all over for you this is your party what are you doing in here? never mind. you're on. let's go.}
<A>__{she pulls him out of his chair, hustles him out of the room, joe right behind them.}
<L>__{exterior lawns, country estate night}
<A>__{the guests have formed themselves into a huge audience, the orchestra strikes up "happy birthday" as parrish appears with allison. an enormous cake is unveiled with one great, lit candle, parrish beams then laughs. he pauses over the cake, now blows the candle out. applause, cries of "speech! speech!", parrish tries to demur but the request becomes loud and rhythmic, he holds up his hand, nods, quiets the crowd. joe observes from the fringe.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(to the guests)}
<D>__{i thought i was going to sneak away tonight...}
<A>__{yells of "no!" "never!"}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{...what a glorious night, every face i see is a memory. it may not be a perfectly perfect memory sometimes we had our ups and downs but we're all together, and you're mine for a night.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{ and i'm going to break precedent, and tell you my one candle wish that you would have a life as lucky as mine, where you can wake up one morning and say "i don't want anything more."}
<P>__{(another moment)}
<D>__{sixty five years don't they go by in a blink?}
<A>__{parrish hesitates, waves and steps away, applause that grows into cheers, the music resumes, another dance tune. quince grabs him, pumps his hand and claps him on the back. now parrish spots allison, he wraps her in a tight embrace, they hold each other close for a moment, but then are separated by a surge of guests. parrish sees susan, she smiles but there is a tinge of sadness about her. he heads towards her, they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what a night.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i'm having a helluva time.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you were right about joe, he is going somewhere }
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{susan is examining parrish very closely.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{are you relieved?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{yes, but }
<A>__{parrish hesitates.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{but what?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i want you to know how much i love you. that you've given a meaning to my life that i had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{daddy }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{no i love you so much and i want you to promise me something. i don't want you to ever worry about me. if anything should happen, i'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{ and i have no regrets.}
<A>__{susan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{and i want you to feel that way, too.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i love you, daddy }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{that's why it's okay.}
<A>__{they drift into silence.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{no regrets?}
<A>__{after a moment.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{'no regrets'.}
<A>__{a long silence, susan smiles.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{it's a good feeling, isn't it?}
<A>__{silence again.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{everybody's saying goodbye...}
<A>__{they regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an understanding.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i'm still here.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{would you like to dance with me, susan?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{oh, yes }
<A>__{he starts to lead her to the floor, immediately stops.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{if you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{oh, dad, you're not old. you'll never be old.}
<A>__{he takes her in his arms and they dance away.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{on a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still commands a view of the dance floor, is joe. his eyes are on parrish and susan, he watches them admiringly yet ruefully. a waiter passes, catches sight of joe, stops.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{can i get you anything, sir?}
<A>__{joe regards the waiter for a moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{do you have any peanut butter?}
<A>__{the waiter hesitates.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{i don't think so, sir.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{thank you, anyway.}
<A>__{the waiter moves off. joe's attention returns to parrish and susan, the dance number ends, a boom.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{on the dance floor.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{the fireworks are about to start.}
<A>__{parrish looks up, sees joe up on the terrace, waiting.}
<C>__{susan }
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{shall we?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you go ahead, honey, i'm going to catch my breath.}
<A>__{suddenly he hugs her, holds her very close. she looks at him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she smiles back. now she heads out with the crowd for the fireworks. when parrish senses she is on her way, he turns and heads up towards joe. joe rises to meet parrish as he approaches.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{happy birthday, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{they watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks. joe's gaze lingers.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{did you say goodbye?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{not exactly.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i guess you have your reasons.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{now that we have a moment, would you mind if i expressed my gratitude for what you did for susan?}
<A>__{joe waits.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{i never heard her speak of any man as she spoke of you it was always what i wanted for her but what happens to her now?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i wouldn't worry about it, bill. these things have a way of working out.}
<A>__{joe regards parrish, waits until he has a sense that parrish has accepted what joe has said, then joe continues:}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{and would you mind if i expressed my gratitude...?}
<A>__{parrish waits.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{for you. for the time you've given me. for the person you are.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{don't blow smoke up my ass, you'll ruin my autopsy.}
<A>__{joe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the crowd below, searching.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{it's hard to let go, isn't it?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{that's life. what can i tell you?}
<A>__{a silence, an understanding there is another more to say. joe looks inquiringly at parrish as if to say "shall we?", parrish nods and joe turns with him. they set off now away from the party, up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking the river.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{down below, the party guests' faces are lit by the initial fireworks display. among them is susan, but her interest isn't there. not something pulls her attention, an over powering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a distance, parrish and joe walking away up the meadow. some thing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens her, she turns back to the party, dazed, tracing on the fireworks.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{up the hill parrish's step slows, joe slowing with him.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i'm getting a little dizzy, i can feel my heart pumping }
<A>__{but parrish doesn't wait for a response, just continues on up the meadow, towards the rise of the hill, joe in step with him.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{should i be afraid?}
<A>__{joe stops, parrish stops with him.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{not a man like you.}
<A>__{parrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides out again, joe right with him. in tandem they continue on and disappear over the crest of the hill. a barrage of fireworks lights up the sky.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{down below, susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks up towards the hill. there is nobody there. she hesitates, now glides away from the party, her step quickens as she walks up towards the hill. susan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from over the crest of the hill where joe and parrish disappeared. he is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out, seems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if pulled by a magnet. now she stops again. it is a man, he keeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{joe...?}
<A>__{he smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right in front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so appealing. they are riveted on each other, uneasy and yet close.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{you're here...}
<A>__{he is trying to get his bearings.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ you bet.}
<A>__{something about him makes susan slightly tentative.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{where did you go?}
<A>__{joe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of time and place.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i don't know y'know, i don't know it's all blurred up and hazy. and would y'know what i mean if i said i don't think it's worth figuring out?}
<A>__{some realization is dawning on susan, it renders her lightheaded.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{...but now i'm back.}
<A>__{susan regards joe intently, searching his face for an answer.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, i don't know what else to say. it's a helluva party }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you think so?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.}
<A>__{susan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his jacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling with the last moments fades away. susan slowly realizes this is the young man. she is shaken, a sudden intake of breath.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{hey, you all right?}
<A>__{his hand politely touches her elbow, courteously lending her support.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{the coffee shop }
<A>__{the young man nods, pleased with her recognition.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{i asked you if i said something wrong and you said it was so right it scared you.}
<A>__{susan holds herself very still.}
<C>__{young man }
<D>__{and forgive me for saying this but then you said and it's been with me ever since }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what has ?}
<A>__{he hesitates.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{you said you liked me.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{y'didn't?}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i said i liked you so much.}
<A>__{she falls silent now, overcome by the last moments' revelations. the young man senses her discomfort which is on the edge of pain.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{hey, everything's going great don't y'think?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer for a moment.}
<C>__{young man }
<D>__{don't you feel that way?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{...we know so little about each other.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{but we've got time.}
<A>__{she searches the young man's eyes, his face is open, completely vulnerable, waiting for her response. a long silence, the words come out haltingly:}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i wish you could've known my father...}
<A>__{another moment.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{me, too.}
<A>__{susan signs, the young man smiles gently, they are completely intent on each other.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{...what do we do now?}
<A>__{a long silence.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{it will come to us.}
<A>__{susan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the music comes up from below, the night fills with light. the young man searches susan's face, now takes her hand and together they start back towards the party.}
<B>__{the end}
