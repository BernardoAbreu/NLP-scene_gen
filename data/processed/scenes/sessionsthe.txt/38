<L>__{interior church. day}
<A>__{rod wheels mark into the church.}
<L>__{interior side chapel. day}
<A>__{mark waits in the little side chapel. father brendan enters.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{hi, good to see you. how are things?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{things are sort of confusing at the moment. i would appreciate your advice, as a friend, if you know what i mean.}
<A>__{father brendan sits down on the end of a pew next to mark.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{sure, and i understand what you mean.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{do you remember at one point you suggested i might see a therapist?}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well, one way or another, it's a long story, i ended up seeing a therapist, a particular sort of therapist, a sex therapist.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{my penis speaks to me, father brendan. sometimes i ejaculate during a bed bath in front of my attendant.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{all i feel is shame and mortification, while other men, apparently, get pleasure. i'm sorry if i sound angry.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{don't worry about it. go on.}
<A>__{mark pauses to take a few breaths on his oxygen mouthpiece, then goes on.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{this therapist suggested i could work with a sexual specialist, have sex with someone known as a sex surrogate, who would be sensitive to my special needs. i've been giving it some thought.}
<A>__{father brendan interrupts him.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{hold on. what do you mean "have sex"?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well, i don't really know how to describe...}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{sorry, that wasn't what... i mean, are we talking about sexual intercourse?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{outside marriage?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i did do my best on the question of marriage.}
<A>__{father brendan shakes his head with concern.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{what is the difference between this sexual specialist and a common prostitute?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't know, but i think there's a difference.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{how do you know she's not some hooker gussied up as a social worker, who's just going to rob you?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i trust what my therapist said about her.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{how old are you?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{thirty eight.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{why exactly now?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i never had any spare cash before. that's a major factor, and i'm probably getting close to my use by date.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{and this is what you want my advice about? fornication?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{your advice as a friend.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{and do i have the casting vote, so to speak?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{let's say i value your advice just as much as i do the therapist's.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{you're serious, aren't you?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i think sex is a serious matter. it's one of the most persistent themes in the bible.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{so, is it possible for me to know a woman, in the biblical sense, and do i want to find out?}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{and you want my opinion?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{father brendan contemplates for a few moments. he looks up at the statue of jesus, then makes a decision.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{i know in my heart that he'll give you a free pass on this one. go for it.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{i said, go for it.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{if you feel up to it. do you feel up to it?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{to tell the truth, i'm scared.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{then we should pray.}
<A>__{father brendan and mark pray together.}
<C>__{father brendan }
<D>__{sweet jesus, mark and i sit at your feet and pray that you bless this little journey, this one small step for a man.}
