<ACTION_ALT>__{NOTE}
<ACTION>__{Most of the sequences in this production are filmed using a hand- held camera or a Steadycam. These very mobile cameras move around the set, and get constantly closer and further from the characters. Still, we'll be using the usual technical terms, such as long shot or full shot or medium shot here and there to give the reader an idea of the location of the camera at the beginning of each sequence. And then we'll mention the movements of the camera.}

<ACTION>__{NEW-YORK - AERIAL VIEW - EXTERIOR NIGHT While the camera is flying over New-York, we keep on hearing the jazz music. The camera reaches a round building that looks like a stadium and starts moving around the building. HOCKEY GAME - INTERIOR NIGHT Long shot on the skating rink. A hockey game is in progress on the rink. The camera follows a player, and then pans on the audience. The camera stops on a medium shot of Larry and Carol, a couple in their early fifties. Larry seems fascinated by the game, but Carol seems to find it boring. She looks at the ceiling, and then puts her hand over her mouth to suppress a yawn. Larry turns toward her.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come on.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What?}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You promised to sit through the entire hockey game without being bored and I'll sit through the Wagner opera with you next week.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know, honey, I promised. I know.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I already bought the earplugs.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah. Well, with your eyesight, I'm surprised you can see the puck.}
<ACTION>__{The crowd starts yelling and we guess that one of the players has done something really good. Carol mockingly claps her hands.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yay, hooray.}
<ACTION>__{Then she raises her eyes to the ceiling, seeming more bored than ever. LARRY'S BUILDING - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT A nice-looking apartment building in New-York. Full shot of the lobby. We see the street through the glass door. An uniformed attendant is standing near a counter, on which he is writing on a book. Larry and Carol are coming from the street and entering the building. He is carrying some shopping bags, and she is reading a newspaper, the Daily News.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{God. I can't wait to get into bed and stretch out.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<ACTION>__{The attendant slightly turns around and bows to them. They bow back to him. He goes back to his book-keeping, and the couple keeps on walking through the lobby.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know, there's a Bob Hope movie on television later.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{know. Can you believe this guy in Indiana ? Killed twelve victims, dismembered them and ate them.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Really ? Well, it's an alternative lifestyle.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, I'll say.}
<ACTION>__{They reach the two elevators. Larry presses the call-button on the wall between the two elevators. LARRY'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT Medium shot inside the cabin of the elevator. The inner door slides open. Carol enters first, still reading her newspaper. Larry enters behind her and presses a button on the control panel.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{Hold the elevator.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{I'm coming.}
<ACTION>__{Hearing people's voices, Larry puts his hand on the edge of the door to keep it from closing.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{Hold the elevator.}
<ACTION>__{Paul and Lilian enter the elevator. They are a middle-aged couple. He is bald and tall, and very smily. She is small, with grey hair.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's right.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you.}
<ACTION>__{Lilian has a broad smile when she recognizes Larry and Carol. The elevator door slides shut. Lilian looks at Carol.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I, uh, I see you at the gym sometimes.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, you do ?}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, we live in the apartment down the hall.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, well, I go whenever I have the discipline.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's important to put that time in. It does wonders.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh god, yeah. I agree with you.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Exercising changed my life.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, geez...}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I prefer to atrophy. I'm not a very exercise person.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We bought a treadmill last week.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, well, we had one. But you know, we got rid of it because it was just taking up too much space.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, it-it-it...}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Because you have to turn it on and get on it once in a while. That was her problem.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, I... exactly, I... and it's so confusing, with all those buttons and computerized programs. I'm just never gonna get that.}
<ACTION>__{LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT Full shot of a very sober and modern hallway. Creme-colored walls, grey carpeting, dark wooden doors. We hear the elevator door opening and Carol comes out, followed by Lilian, Larry and Paul. They all talk together and we can hardly understand the following dialogue.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, I know. It's late.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's so wonderful, meeting.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, well, yeah.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It is just like New York. You have neighbors. You never meet them... You guys...}
<ACTION>__{The following line, said by Lilian, is clearer and we understand it better.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{... I've seen you so many times in the hallway, you know... and I've always wanted to come up and say hallo.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, anyway... good night.}
<ACTION>__{Larry and Carol walk away from Lilian and Paul, who remain near the elevator.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{Good night. Such a lovely couple. You know that...}
<ACTION>__{Paul bends down to pick up something on the carpet. Lilian walks one step in Larry's direction.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, uh, say, hello ?}
<ACTION>__{Paul starts opening his apartment door, just across the hallway from the elevator.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{Huh ? Yeah ?}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Huh, listen... why don't you come in for a-a-a second and have a drink with us ? I mean, we'd really love that.}
<ACTION>__{The camera pans around toward Larry and Carol. Larry makes a negative sign with his hand.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, oh well that'd be fine...}
<CHAR>__{PAUL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{She makes great Irish coffee.}
<ACTION>__{Mute conversation between Carol and Larry. Larry evidently doesn't want to accept Lilian's invitation, but Carol wants to.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{Oh, please ? Uh uh, I want you to give me a treadmill lesson.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There's a movie on television I want to watch.}
<ACTION>__{Carol starts walking toward Lilian and Paul's apartment, followed reluctantly by Larry. The camera pans around during Carol's next line, and we see Carol entering Lilian an Paul's apartment.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, about the tread... oh, well, if I can figure it out, then believe me, anybody can.}
<ACTION>__{She laughs, and Larry, entering the apartment behind her, utters a forced laugh. PAUL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT The cosy apartment of middle upper-class people. The decoration looks like them. Medium shot of Lilian walking across the bedroom toward the large double bed. She walks near the famous treadmill.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Have a look at the instructions. They drive me crazy. You know ? I don't know what I'm doing at all. Let's look...}
<CHAR>__{CAROL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{No. Please, it's easy.}
<ACTION>__{Lilian picks up a book on a table near the bed.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Wonderful book they've given me. Now I'm at level five.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{What ?}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That I know.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{You're that advanced ?}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, yeah.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{God, I only got to level two.}
<ACTION>__{Lilian brings the book to Carol.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look at these diagrams. Do you believe this ?}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's amazing.}
<ACTION>__{She is standing near the treadmill. Lilian shows her one of the diagram in the book.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I can't understand this even.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Let me see.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, well. See this ?}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay.}
<ACTION>__{PAUL'S APPARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT One of the wall could be a bay window, but, for the moment, it is entirely covered by a beige drape. Medium shot of Paul bringing a stamp book to Larry.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now, let me show you a mint 1933 airmail. Very rare... and very beautiful.}
<ACTION>__{Larry is seated near a small table, on which Paul puts the book down. Paul sits down next to Larry.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<ACTION>__{Paul picks up a special philatelist magnifying glass and puts it in front of the stamp, for Larry to have a better look at it.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look at that. And this plate block is quite unique because it has a flaw in the engraving. See if you can see it.}
<ACTION>__{Larry, who is not interested in philately at all, scratches his head.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Uh, it's hard for me.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Actually I'll give you a little hint. Right down here in the corner.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That tiny thing there ?}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Interesting, yeah.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ah, you have a really...}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That makes it quite valuable, you see. And I just got a commemorative set of issues that are going to be quite valuable, too.}
<ACTION>__{He picks up a transparent envelope inside which are several stamps.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look at the color, right there. All these are gonna become a real f...}
<ACTION>__{Larry stands up.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, listen... we're probably keeping you up, right ?}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, no-no-no. This is wonderful.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I should be going.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What do you do, if I may ask ?}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Me ? I'm in book publishing. I work up at Harper's.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you really ?}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I own an old, uh, cinema. Having it redone.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Used to have a string of three, but, you know, business is not what it used to be.}
<ACTION>__{He picks up some more stamps from the table.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now, look at these presidentials. Look at the color work. Even the perforations are still intact.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Where's Carol ?}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{All the...}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Because I should really be going, actually.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, really ?}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah. I mean, so, we...}
<ACTION>__{In the background, behind Larry, we see Carol and Lilian entering the room.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Coffee's ready !}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, coffee. I forgot coffee.}
<ACTION>__{He turns around to face the women.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{Good. We can get back to this later. Come on in.}
<ACTION>__{We see Paul's hand on Larry's shoulder, pushing him toward the centre of the room. A little later. Full shot of the room. They are all seated around a low table, Larry and Carol on the sofa, Paul and Lilian on two armchairs. They've just finished their coffee.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, we've never had any children, but it's easy to empathize. Oh, um, uh, what college does your son attend ?}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Brown.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nice color.}
<ACTION>__{They all laugh.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Paul never attended college. He's self-made.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Always regretted it. I think knowledge is the second most important thing. First is health, then knowledge, then money.}
<ACTION>__{Larry puts his cup down on the low table.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know, it's amazing how time, we,... we'll just...}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And, do you work ?}
<ACTION>__{Larry stands up.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Huh ? Do I ?}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<ACTION>__{Larry looks at Carol and sits back on the sofa.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, well, I actually, um, I used to work at an ad agency, but that was many years ago.}
<ACTION>__{The camera moves closer to Carol and Larry.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But... You know, I've been seriously thinking of starting a little restaurant. But, well, Larry, he's trying to talk me out of it.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, she's a great cook, though, really. Her duck and fennel omelette on a bed of scallops and Hollandaise sauce with truffles and sweetbreads'll make you snap into a fetal position and have you in bed screaming for a month.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He loves to tease me, but actually, he really loves exotic food.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{My weakness is any rich dessert, cream, butter, anything with fat.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, really ? Oh well, let... listen... I'll fix you a dessert that'll make your eyeballs roll up. You'll have to exercise for a month to work it off.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<CHAR>__{PAUL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{We're going to Le Cirque for our anniversary.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, really ?}
<ACTION>__{The camera moves around, away from Larry and Carol, to Paul.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{Yes. Twenty-eight years. November.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{Really ?}
<CHAR>__{PAUL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, what do you buy the woman who buys everything ?}
<ACTION>__{The camera moves around backward, away from Paul and back to Larry and Carol.}
<CHAR>__{LILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We already have twin cemetery plots.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, it's... I always think a Bentley is in good taste. You know, or you can go the route that I went with her. On her twentieth, I got her some very lovely handkerchiefs.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah. Oh no. But, you know, they had my initials on them.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, it was a very, very high-class item. I didn't even know her size. I'm going over.}
<ACTION>__{Carol bursts out laughing. Black screen. Actually, we are in : LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT Carol and Larry's apartment is quite different from the one we've just left. It is the apartment of a couple of New-York intellectuals, with nice, artistic furniture. We hear a door opening.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jesus, couldn't you keep the conversation going a little longer in there ?}
<ACTION>__{Lights are switched on. Full shot. We see only part of the hall, the camera being in a corridor, and the walls of the corridor concealing part of the hall. Carol enters the apartment, and Larry holds the door for her.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I was signaling you frantically.}
<ACTION>__{Larry closes the door.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I was just trying to be neighborly.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Neighborly ? If this guy showed me his stamp collection one more time... I mean, my favorite thing in life is to, you know, look at canceled postage.}
<ACTION>__{The camera follows Larry walking in the corridor toward : LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT Actually there are two large beds in the bedroom, the room being divided by a partition set between the two beds. The partition is only a half wall. There is a opening, without door, at each end of the partition, to go from one section of the room to the other.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{Oh, come on, Larry. It was sweet. They, you know, they're looking forward to their anniversary.}
<ACTION>__{Medium shot of Larry taking his jacket off. He puts it on a chair.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, and I'm looking forward to seeing that Bob Hope movie. I don't know why they put it on so late.}
<ACTION>__{The camera turns back to the corridor and Carol, still in the front hall.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know, do you think that's gonna happen to us ?}
<CHAR>__{LARRY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{What ?}
<ACTION>__{Carol walks in the corridor, toward the bedroom.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, that we'll become like them ? You know, just another dull aging couple, you know, with our little walks, you know...}
<ACTION>__{She walks into the bedroom.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{We are a dull aging couple.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Our TV, our lox and bagels. And... and our twin cemetery plots ?}
<ACTION>__{Larry is seated on his bed. Carol looks at some pills bottles on the night table.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, we should be as lucky as them. To, you know, to be in their physical shape, at their age ? They look great. Did you see the dumbbells this guy lifts ? If I lifted dumbbells like those, I would get a hernia the size of the San Andrea's Fault.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How often do you think they make love ?}
<ACTION>__{She goes out of the main part of the room, and the camera follows her. She sits down on the other bed and starts taking her shoes off.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{Oh, you know, probably more than we do, in their shape. You know, I'm sure as much as once a week.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Larry ?}
<CHAR>__{LARRY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{I'm exhausted. What ?}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you still find me attractive ?}
<CHAR>__{LARRY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{Of course. What kind of question is that ? Of course I do.}
<ACTION>__{Carol stands up from the bed and moves across the room. The camera, still located in the main part of the room, follows Carol, so we don't actually see her walking, but we see the partition and the large clock on it.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over from behind the partition)}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, but we're not turning into a pair of comfortable old shoes, are we ? Do you think ?}
<ACTION>__{Carol reappears on the other side of the partition.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(voice over)}
<DIAL>__{Never comfortable.}
<CHAR>__{CAROL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No ?}
<ACTION>__{Larry's head appears in the forefront of the shot. He is still seated on the bed.}
<CHAR>__{LARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't think you have to worry about that.}
<ACTION>__{MARKET PLACE - EXTERIOR DAY Long shot on a large outdoor antique market place in New-York. The camera pans along the stands in the market, showing sellers and customers.}
