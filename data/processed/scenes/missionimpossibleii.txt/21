<L>__{int farmhouse (day)}
<A>__{luther and billy with ethan setting up their operation. there's a blip on one of the screens.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{it's the transponder.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{put in the coordinates and let's get a visual. the visuals aren't coming up.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{the satellite doesn't work as fast as i do.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{yeah, i've heard about you, luther, and i just want to tell you it's an honor and a pleasure to be working with you blokes, whoaa! that's some transponder!}
<A>__{as billy speaks, the visual come on line and nyah has become visible.}
<C>__{luther}
<P>__{(a jaundiced eye, to ethan)}
<D>__{it certainly is. how did we get so lucky?}
<A>__{ethan pointedly ignore the question. pov moving (palm beach day) rounding the tip of the bay's crescent, revealing the beach and dock at ambrose's palm lined residence.}
<B>__{nyah}
<A>__{the speedboat's engine's are cut. nyah looks momentarily stricken. pov nyah (moving) a lone slender figure silhouetted at the end of the dock, still as the piling besides which it stands. but the features remain obscured by the sun at his back.}
<B>__{ethan}
<A>__{leans forward as the slender figure grows larger,}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(to ethan)}
<D>__{is it him, then?}
<A>__{pov moving the tide is too low for the boat to dock, making it necessary for he boat to approach the shore. the slender figure moves off the end of the dock and onto the beach.}
<B>__{the cigarette}
<A>__{idles into shadow water but the props start chewing into the sand the boatman grumbles he can't get any closer. the slender figure has moved to the shoreline and the angle of the light changes ambrose is waiting. nyah hesitates only a flicker of an instant, slips over the side into thigh high water without taking her eyes off ambrose. ambrose strides right on into the bay. as they are just an arm's length apart:}
<B>__{nyah}
<A>__{takes a deep breath, presses the button to scramble the transponder. with ethan (interior sheepfarm safehouse) the picture abruptly goes dead.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{damn. just when it was about to get interesting.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{it's okay. she scrambled the transmission. luther, continue feeding the gps her position.}
<A>__{luther punches in. the signal and the global coordinates are given. they wait.}
