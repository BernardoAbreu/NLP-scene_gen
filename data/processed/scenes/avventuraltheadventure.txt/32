<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{it is morning inside the hotel trinacria. claudia has just had breakfast in her room and is almost finished dressing. it is a rather large room, set out with old pieces of furniture. the place is in a state of disarray, and the door leading into sandro's room is wide open. because of the general disorder, claudia is unable to find her stockings. but instead of being angered by this, she appears quite jovial and laughs gaily. as she continues to look for her stockings, sandro appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{are you ready?}
<A>__{claudia comes up to sandro and gazes upon him with a look of adoration.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(ironically)}
<D>__{but why am i so infatuated with you?}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{yes, yes, yes, yes... right away...}
<A>__{she starts looking hurriedly around the room again but is still unable to locate her stockings. suddenly, up from the street comes the sound of music. it is a popular tune, wild and rhythmic, emanating from a publicity truck as part of some local advertising stunt. claudia is overtaken by the music and cannot resist the temptation to do a little dance for sandro. little by little, she starts swaying back and forth to the music. then, kicking off her shoes, she begins to dance around the room in her bare feet. sandro looks at her, amused but also somewhat impatient.}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(leaving)}
<D>__{okay. i understand. see you later.}
<A>__{claudia rushes up to the door, and feigning an exaggerated attitude of despair, says:}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{and you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{as soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. i will be waiting for you right outside on the square.}
<A>__{claudia is in a playful mood and she is anxious to demonstrate her exuberance.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(teasingly)}
<D>__{very well. but you must first tell me that when you go out without me it's like going out without one of your legs. go ahead, have a look around the town all by yourself, but you'll have to hobble along on only one leg. and you must also tell me that you are filled with a great desire to embrace my shadow on the walls... then you must tell me...}
<P>__{(suddenly her tone of voice}
<D>__{changes and she becomes}
<P>__{quite serious)}
<D>__{you must tell me that you love me.}
<A>__{sandro replies with the same good natured tolerance with which he had been watching claudia as she danced her coquettish dance.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{but you know it already. why must i tell you?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{so, you wonder why?}
<A>__{without waiting for him to answer, she goes back towards the center of the room and once again starts looking around for her stockings. sandro begins to leave.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{then i will see you later.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{okay. in a few minutes.}
<A>__{sandro goes out the door. claudia finally locates her stockings and proceeds to finish dressing.}
