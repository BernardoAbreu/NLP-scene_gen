<A>__{a few cardinals huddle together in silent prayer under michelangelo's famous fresco. most prominent above them is `the creation of adam'. the cardinals look up in horror as the rumbling intensifies. a crack forms on the ceiling, shooting straight through god touching the finger of adam. then the whole fresco breaks apart.}
