<A>__{maurice uses a highway guardrail as a backrest. he takes a seat in the dirt. maurice's hair is damp with sweat. his breathing relegated to slow gasps. his left hand covering his rib cage protectively. blood begins to trickle through the spaces between his fingers. maurice closes his eyes for a moment, before his bent leg goes into spasms... maurice is forced to straighten the leg instantly... jarring his tender rib cafe... maurice clings to the back of his thigh... maurice is defeated... on the verge of tears. he glances way down the road and spots a tiny cloud of smoke miles away in the distance. a car is moving in his direction. maurice looks up into the dazzling white sky. drops of sweat falling into his eyes.}

<P>__{(whisper)}
<D>__{it's over ellen... i failed you again.}
<A>__{maurice looks down the road at the cloud of dust growing larger.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i tried ellen, i really tried... i don't have the strength.}
<A>__{the cloud is now clearly a car... maurice stares up into the sky again... the tears racing the sweat down his cheeks. maurice yells to the heavens.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{you said i would never be alone!... you promised...}
<P>__{(his yelling turns to sobs)}
<D>__{... you promised.}
<A>__{maurice's is interrupted by a slight rustling behind his head. maurice turns and looks through his tears... there, a few feet from him, perched quietly and majestically on the guardrail is a golden eagle. it stands two and half feet tall. it spreads it's great wings. the feathers expand like a blanket, spanning six feet, and throwing a gentle shade on maurice's face. maurice is frozen in wonder. the magic of the moment glows in his eyes. maurice's face gains life... the dark feathered eagle stands like a god before maurice. the moment is breathtaking.}
