<L>__{ext arctic twilight}
<A>__{the body of victor frankenstein lies on an impressive bier of wood, stacked and lashed. his body is wrapped in rough canvas, his face as dead and white as the ice. walton and crew stand facing the bier. walton silently reads a passage from the bible. oily black smoke from a small campfire drifts past. walton closes the book. amens are muttered. walton glances to grigori and nods. grigori moves forward with two other men. they begin dousing the pyre with lamp oil, soaking it. walton moves to the campfire, picks up an unlit torch. he dips it into the fire, igniting the pitch, turns. the men back away, preparing for the coming blaze... ...and a dog starts howling on deck, others joining in. the men pause. gazing across the ice. dread seeping into their bones. there's a figure out there. huge and humanlike in frame. loping slowly over the ice. approaching.}

<D>__{christ.}
<A>__{grigori snatches up the rifle, shoulders it smoothly, cocks the flintlock. walton glances over, pushes the muzzle skyward, denying his aim.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{it has a right to bear witness.}
<A>__{grigori hesitates, nods. if you say so. the men grow more unsettled as the creature draws nearer. frightened muttering. men start backing toward the ship.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{stand fast. all of you.}
<A>__{the men stand fast. the creature stops some thirty yards out. a silent tableau on the ice. the men facing the creature. walton holding the torch. the pyre waiting for the kiss of flame. walton moves forward... ...and a thunderous crack is heard, the men whip their heads as a gigantic plate of ice goes spinning into the air some fifty yards away and comes crashing back down again. it's like tectonic plates building pressure toward an earthquake: once it goes, it goes with terrifying speed and force: crack! another eruption. crack! and another. crack! ice cascading skyward.}

<A>__{walton rushes forward. crack! the ice erupts before him. the torch goes flying. walton sprawls flat on his back.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{back to the ship!}
<A>__{the men don't have to be told twice. they're already in full retreat, scrambling for their lives. ice is detonating for miles around as if pounded by artillery. grigori helps walton to his feet. the torch lies burning not ten feet away. a heartbeat of hesitation. walton wondering if he should go for it. grigori pulling wildly on his sleeve...}
<C>__{grigori}
<D>__{leave it!}
<A>__{...and then the matter is decided for them as a huge rift opens at their feet, running an explosive zig zag course across the ice, separating them from the torch. they fall back to join the retreat, stumbling after the others, pursued by the ice dissolving at their heels. the creature watches his last wish for victor frankenstein snatched away by god's whim and breaking ice.}
<B>__{no}
<A>__{he starts forward. behind him, a detonation of ice throws a massive fist into the air, creating a magnificent halo of cascading water and spinning fragments.}
<B>__{the nevsky}
<A>__{the first wave of fleeing men reach the ship, crowding to the drop net for salvation, scrambling up the side. walton and grigori stumble along, closing distance to the ship. walton glances back, amazed to see:}
<B>__{the creature}
<A>__{racing across the ice, making for the torch, teeth set in a wide grimace of effort. detonations threaten to swallow him from all sides. suddenly, things go from bad to worse.}
<B>__{the nevsky}
<A>__{breaks free with an enormous groan, heeling slowly over, triggering massive eruptions in all directions. the crew hang onto the drop net for dear life. several men plummet into the icy water. the creature is propelled by a detonation as if held stepped on a land mine, cartwheeling helplessly through the air to plunge headfirst into the water, huge plates of spinning ice crashing down after him. gone. walton and grigori are knocked flat as a fissure appears between them. grigori, dazed, is lifted into the air on a teetering table of ice, desperately trying to scramble back but sliding forward nonetheless, rising up and up, a gaping maw of frigid water yawning wider and wider before him. walton grabs the back of grigori's coat and tries to drag him off... but the coat is snatched from his fingers as the ice see saws forward in a complete flip and slams grigori thunderously into the drink.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{grigori!}
<A>__{the nevsky finishes righting itself, swaying ponderously as she finds honest ocean beneath her hull. some men are reaching the top of the net, hurling themselves over the gunwale to the deck. those lower on the drop net are helping their fellows from the water, hauling them to safety. frankenstein's bier is now corkscrewing in slow circles on its own ice floe. the torch is drifting on a chunk of ice. still burning.}

<C>__{walton}
<D>__{grigori!}
<A>__{the first mate breaks surface in the foreground, gasping and strangling for breath, face already turning blue, arms thrashing wildly, dragged down by the now impossible weight of his own clothing. walton strains to reach him, nearly going into the water himself. grigori keeps thrashing and gasping. dying. he's dying right in front of walton's eyes.}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{somebody throw me a gaff!}
<A>__{too late. grigori goes down for the final time, vanishing for good beneath the frigid water. gone. walton throws his head back with a bellow of anguish... ...and grigori breaks the surface again, rising slowly and impossibly from the water. arms and legs windmill against the air, propelled from below with nearly aulic strength. he gazes down in shock at the massive fist clutching his chest... and the arm that grows and grows, rising, lifting him up and up... and the hideous face that breaks the surface beneath him. the face of a nightmare. the creature lunges hugely, hurling grigori through the air right into walton's arms. both men go sprawling. walton scrambles to his knees, makes eye contact with the creature. the monster is exhausted. near his limit. walton thrusts out his arm, fingers grasping to help.}

<A>__{the creature swivels his gaze. the burning torch is drifting away. he looks grimly back to walton. walton beckoning to him. come. grab my hand. the creature swims away, knifing through the water after the torch. walton turns, drags grigori gasping to his feet, helps him limp toward the nevsky across the lurching ice. creature struggles through the water, crushed and battered by ice floes on all sides. going under. walton and grigori slog grimly on across the disintegrated ice, knee deep and nearly walking on water. they sink, finding nothing beneath their feet. lines are thrown down and caught. walton and grigori are hauled from the frigid arctic water and hoisted up the side of the ship. the last ones aboard. burning torch is spinning slowly on its chunk of ice. bony fingers break the surface of the water. a straining hand. the creature's eyes rise from the murk. bleary with exhaustion and cold. he seizes the torch. raises it high. swims grimly on.}
<B>__{aboard the nevsky}
<A>__{the crew bundle walton and grigori in blankets, both men shivering with exposure. walton lurches to the gunwale, gazing off. the men crowd to his side. the creature swims on, head barely breaking the water, torch held high to keep it burning. relentlessly determined. this is the most grueling effort we've ever seen. gasping and sinking beneath the surface... ...and finally grasping with frozen fingers the ice floe upon which lies frankenstein's funeral pyre. he hauls himself from the water. moving now in a slow motion litany of exhaustion. climbing the pyre. scaling the wood. seeking the top. never giving up. the creature joins his maker atop the bier, straddling the wood, holding the torch aloft as if lighting his master's way to the netherworld, frankenstein's personal boatman across the river styx. frankenstein himself lies serenely at his creation's knees, content to be shown the way... the creature turns his face to the sky, gulping air, spreading his arms wide in sublime triumph. feeling the wind on his skin, the sleet on his face, the grim joy in his heart. cold. so very cold. he glances at the torch burning low in his outstretched hand, pitch almost gone, sputtering and trailing smoke. he looks down. at frankenstein. the oil soaked canvas. the saturated wood. there's that smell. yes. he scoops victor up with his free arm and cradles him to his breast, as tender as a mother comforting a baby. walton and the crew gaze in horror. realization dawning:}
