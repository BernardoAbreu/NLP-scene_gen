<L>__{interior evan's cell day}
<A>__{evan enters a dimly lit cell plastered with pictures of jesus christ and various saints. burning flames on open cans of shoe polish serve as candles to the large shrine. there is a stained bare mattress on the top bunk. sitting on the bottom bunk is carlos, 30s, a massive hispanic convict covered with faded indian ink jail tats of christ in agony. carlos stares at evan disinterestedly as evan makes up his bed on the top bunk.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{first time?}
<A>__{evan nods glumly.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{best not bitch up. wind up someone's luggage that way.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{can you protect me?}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{jesus himself couldn't make me take on the brotherhood. when they come, just put your mind in another place, man. be somewhere else.}
<A>__{a buzzer sounds. carlos leaves the cell without another word.}
