<A>__{sam stares out the window at an unfamiliar neighborhood. on his lap, the pink box, now ripped, allowing us to see lucy's birthday cake. it's lopsided from having been thawed and refrozen.}
<L>__{exterior bus stop noon}
<A>__{sam waits for his transfer. he sets the cake down on the bench and takes out a piece of paper with directions written on it. the number 43 bus pull sup and sam consults his paper once more before jumping on, forgetting the cake. the bus goes half a block before it screeches to a halt. sam jumps off and runs back for the cake, but the bus continues on its way. moments later, the number 34 bus pulls up. flustered and worried about being late, sam jumps on. he feels something cold on his hand, looks down, the box is starting to leak ice cream.}
