<L>__{interior osborne house, brown's quarters day}
<A>__{some minutes later, brown is angrily unpacking a trunk. his humiliation expresses itself in the extraordinary ferocity with which he slams down every object. his younger brother, archie, sits on the bed. he's in his early thirties, bright, sharp and dressed in the same distinctive kilt and tweed.}
<C>__{archie}
<P>__{(telling it fast)}
<D>__{so the day they arrive, she greets the sultan and his family with barely a word and then retires to her chamber. the sultan, not used to state occasions without a head of state, is standing in the lobby waiting for someone to tell him what to do. but the court is under strict instructions not to talk in the corridors so nobody speaks to him, not a living soul, for the whole afternoon. so now it's dinner and everyone's standing round the table still not a word waiting for her majesty to arrive. one hour goes by, two, the sultan's getting a wee bit peckish to say the least. so finally, his wee laddy breaks for the cold meats and stuffs a slice in his mouth. well, the uproar when she heard. you'd have thought someone had stolen the crown jewels.}
<A>__{brown stares back, still pissed off.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{so, there are rules. things you do and things you don't do.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i was just telling the woman how i feel, for god's sake.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{you don't tell her majesty how you feel.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i speak as i find, archie.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{not down south you don't.}
<A>__{brown slams a drawer shut. archie lets it go and watches his brother. a beat.}
<C>__{archie }
<D>__{so what did ponsonby do when she started shouting?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i think he nearly ruptured his truss.}
<A>__{a beat, then both men burst out laughing.}
