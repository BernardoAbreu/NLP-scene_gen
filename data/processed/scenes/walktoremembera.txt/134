<L>__{exterior beach (neuse river) late night}
<A>__{a starry night with a bright moon. glimmering silver water. jamie and landon walk onto a dock. distant}
<B>__{fireworks boom.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{it's places like this that make me certain there's a god.}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{you're sometimes not sure?}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{i'm sure. pretty sure.}
<A>__{they reach the end of the dock. she turns to face the wind. it blows her hair. she turns his face the same way.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{it's like the wind. i can't see it but i feel it.}
<A>__{he closes his eyes. feeling the wind. opens them again, rejecting the idea.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{we can measure wind.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{what do you actually know with religion?}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{wonder. beauty. joy.}
<P>__{(beat, quieter)}
<D>__{love.}
<A>__{she's embarrassed. she tries to avoid implying anything.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{my mother told me god is love, so when you're feeling love, you're feeling god.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think talking about these things threatens their very beauty and mystery.}
<A>__{her tone is matter of fact, but landon's got a serious and tender look on his face. he touches her hair.}
<C>__{jamie}
<P>__{(almost a whisper)}
<D>__{i don't understand...}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{maybe you're not supposed to.}
<A>__{he moves closer.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{i might kiss you.}
<A>__{she looks down. shy.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{i might do it wrong.}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(tenderly)}
<D>__{not possible.}
<A>__{he touches her neck, her cheek, her mouth. then leans in and kisses her. a tender, soft kiss. he pulls away. they look at each other a moment.}
<C>__{landon}
<D>__{i love you, jamie.}
<A>__{there, he put it out there, risked looking and feeling foolish. not the old landon. jamie looks away. mixed emotions. happy and sad.}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{now's when you say something.}
<C>__{jamie}
<P>__{(overwhelmed)}
<D>__{i can't.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i can't explain.}
<A>__{she turns back to him, her eyes shining. she touches his face and they kiss again, deeply. but after a few moments, she drops her chin onto his shoulder. smiling, glowing even, but slightly aloof, staring at the water. he pulls away slightly to study her face. he touches her cheek and brings her back from wherever she's been.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{you make me feel...}
<C>__{landon}
<P>__{(hopeful)}
<D>__{loved?}
<C>__{jamie}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{that. and less strange.}
<A>__{tears run down her cheeks. landon wipes them away with his thumbs, attributing them to happiness.}
