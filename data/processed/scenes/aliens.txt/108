<A>__{the apc crashes inside, showering debris. hicks, supporting a limping hudson, appears out of the smoke. the apc pulls up broadside and burke gets the crew door open. drake and vasquez back out of the dense mist, firing as they fall back. drake goes empty, slams the buckles cutting loose his smart gun harness, and unslings a flame thrower. hicks pushes hudson inside, leaps in after him and drags vasquez inside, massive gear and all. she sees a dark shape lunge toward drake. she fires one burst, prone. clean body hit. the flash lights up the hideous inhuman grin, blowing open the thing's thorax. a spray of bright yellow acid slashes across drake's face and chest, eating into him like a hot knife through butter. he drops in boiling smoke, reflexively triggering his flame thrower. the jet of liquid fire arcs around as he falls, engulfing the back half of the apc.}
