<L>__{exterior streets day}
<A>__{hasari, mouth half open, flecked with spume, pulls a huge marwari. he's pouring sweat, his eyes are blood shot. he has never looked more like a horse. they arrive at a cross street. the marwari gets down and pays hasari. hasari slumps against the rickshaw and, while he awaits his next rider, counts his crum pled pile of notes and coins.}
<L>__{exterior clinic day}
<A>__{max, joan, aristotle john, margareta, mehboub, perhaps a dozen others trying to raise the level of the low wall at the entrance with bricks. the wall caves in. other people in the neighborhood rush to rebuild it.}

<P>__{(shouting to the others)}
<D>__{my dear friends, it's just occurred to me what inspired me to stay here.}
<A>__{thinking he's about to make some cogent remark about this unified effort...}
<C>__{margareta}
<D>__{what's that, doctor big brother?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{the opportunity to acquire waterfront property at a reasonable price.}
<A>__{joan begins to laugh; the others don't get it, query each other as to what's funny about that.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i hate to admit it, junior, but that was actually quite witty.}
<A>__{she whacks him on the shoulder with a wet, muddy paw.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{ut nobody laugh; it's a natural disaster we have guests.}
<A>__{everyone turns to...}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{manubai and ravi, their car parked at the entryway to the clinic. a big puddle separates them.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'd throw my cape down, but i'm all out of dry capes.}
<A>__{he sloshes through the water to them, wiping his muddy hands on his pants. he offers a semi clean hand to each in turn.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's very nice to see you. both of you.}
<C>__{ravi}
<D>__{we heard you were still here. vijay wanted to send some things.}

<C>__{max}
<D>__{shall we unload the car?}
<C>__{ravi}
<D>__{yes, yes, by all means.}
<A>__{max whistles, indicates the car. people come and start unloading it, ravi showing the way, leaving max and manubai alone a moment, aloka flicking her eyes at the two of them.}
<C>__{manubai}
<D>__{i'm surprised. i really didn't think you'd stick it out.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{people grow older; sometimes they even grow up.}
<A>__{he smiles a sweet smile at her. she smiles back at him.}
