<L>__{interior palace commodus' bedroom day}
<A>__{commodus is wrapped in a sheet, gazing out a window.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{caesar...}
<A>__{he turns. she stops. he looks as if he has not slept for days. if a word could now sum up his clouded face it is this: tormented. she goes to him, embraces him. he holds her tightly.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{i am sorry to have kept you away... i needed this time to think...}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{of course...}
<A>__{he moves away from her, slowly moving around the room.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{i limited my world to these four walls so as to let my mind free... again and again my mind settles on but one question... what kind of world are we making when the people of rome prefer a slave in the arena to their father?}
<A>__{a beat. commodus' strange philosophical bent is unnerving lucilla.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{it is my responsibility to make the world as it should be. how is it i have made this world?}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{brother, do not be influenced by the mob. they are a great, faceless beast }
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{they are not "the mob," lucilla, they are the people. they are my children and all i want to do is love them.}
<A>__{a beat. he stands before a bust of marcus aurelius. he touches it.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{our father loved maximus... and i love him still... yet he defies me, he tasks me in front of my children. and they love him for it. just as marcus loved him for it. tell me why, lucilla.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{they see themselves in him. they throw in their own sad dreams alongside his. they think he fights for them.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{and what do i do but fight for them?! i give them games to please them. i strangle dissent to give them peace. i empower the praetorians to give them order. what more can i do?!}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{say i should fight him, in the arena. let my children see who the gods truly favor.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{and what if he should win?}
<A>__{a beat. commodus continues to slowly move around the room.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{a god is more powerful than a man...}
<A>__{this odd statement hangs in the air for a moment. then:}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{caesar, you let this unduly worry you. at best he is a passing fancy he is a name, an image on a banner, ephemeral he will be forgotten as the next fancy appears }
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{but i need to know why do they love him?}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{mercy.}
<A>__{he stops. looks at her.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{he will not kill in the arena. he is merciful. as they all wish they were in their own hearts.}
<A>__{something in her words has struck a chord in him.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{and for that moment in the arena they are merciful too. for a moment... they are gods. offering life.}
<A>__{he looks at her.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{but who can be more merciful than the emperor of rome?}
