<A>__{on the monitors above the long row of chambers colorful 3 d images of the prisoner's brains are being constructed, like pet scans. dense digital read outs below, as data is analyzed. (levels of seratonin, endorphins, etc.) beside these are barcodes and small inset photos taken within the chamber, the subjects looking frightened. in the operating theater, the lasers are still now, their grisly work done for the moment, awaiting the next batch. an engineer, a nice looking, well built young man in loose black clothing, moves down the row of chambers, studying results. he speaks into a subtle head set:}

<D>__{32578 acceptable. 32579 no, insufficient neural capacity. 32580 eh, this one shouldn't have even been brought here...}
<A>__{as he speaks, the barcodes on the monitors in question turn either red or green in response to his judgments. he reaches kyle's chamber, we see kyle's anguished face on the monitor photograph.}

<D>__{32581 looks good...}
<A>__{kyle gets a green barcode, the engineer is on to star, he strokes his chin.}

<D>__{be emotionally compatible. pass.}
<A>__{on star's monitor red barcode. the engineer kicks something on the floor, bends down to pick it up star's baseball cap. he flings it expertly into a nearby trash receptacle.}
