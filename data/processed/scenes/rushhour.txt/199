<A>__{carson steps inside. he looks around the bedroom it's empty. no furnishings, the closet shelves are bare, even the pictures on the walls are gone, leaving only their outline. carson cautiously goes into the living room it's also empty. all that remains are a few cardboard boxes, and three flower pots in macrame ceiling hangers by the living room window. some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them.}
