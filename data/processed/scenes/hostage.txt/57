<L>__{interior the smiths' garage night}
<A>__{the garage is dark, lit only by the light that comes from the kitchen's open door, as dennis, mars and a reluctant kevin enter }
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{someone should stay with mr. smith. what if he wakes up?}
<C>__{dennis}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{that's why we tied him, dumbass. now come here and see this }
<A>__{dennis shows them a small casement window, and pushes open the window to reveal a thick hedge }
<C>__{dennis }
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{these bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard. all we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{that's crazy, dennis. the cops will see us.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{not if they're looking at something else.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{mars}
<D>__{let's burn the house.}
<A>__{mars says it so simply that the moment is frozen. mars is holding the big claw hammer, kneading it as if it was a living thing. his face is masked by shadows, but his eyes both glow as if already reflecting flame }
