<A>__{the newsboys are still heard from the street below fainter but very insistent. kane's office is gas lit, of course, as is the rest of the enquirer building. kane, in his shirt sleeves, stands at the open window looking out. the bed is already made up. on it is seated bernstein, smoking the end of a cigar. leland is in a chair.}
<C>__{newsboys' voices}
<D>__{chronicle! chronicle! h'ya the chronicle get ya! chronicle!}
<A>__{kane, taking a deep breath of the morning air, closes the window and turns to the others. the voices of the newsboys, naturally, are very much fainter after this.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{we'll be on the street soon, charlie another ten minutes.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(looking at his watch)}
<D>__{it's three hours and fifty minutes late but we did it }
<A>__{leland rises from the chair, stretching painfully.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{tired?}

<D>__{it's been a tough day.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{a wasted day.}

<D>__{you just made the paper over four times today, mr. kane. that's all }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i've changed the front page a little, mr. bernstein. that's not enough there's something i've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print i've got to make the "new york enquirer" as important to new york as the gas in that light.}
<C>__{leland}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{what're you going to do, charlie?}
<A>__{kane looks at him for a minute with a queer smile of happy concentration.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{my declaration of principles }
<P>__{(he says it with quotes around it)}
<D>__{don't smile, brad }
<P>__{(getting the idea)}
<D>__{take dictation, mr. bernstein }
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{can't take shorthand, mr. kane }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i will write it myself.}
<A>__{kane grabs a piece of rough paper and a grease crayon. sitting down on the bed next to bernstein, he starts to write.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(looking over his shoulder)}
<D>__{you don't wanta make any promises, mr. kane, you don't wanta keep.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(as he writes)}
<D>__{these'll be kept.}
<P>__{(stops for a minute}
<D>__{and reads what he}
<P>__{has written; reading)}
<D>__{i will provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.}

<C>__{leland}
<D>__{that's the second sentence you've started with "i" }
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{people are going to know who's responsible. and they're going to get the news the true news quickly and simply and entertainingly.}
<P>__{(he speaks with real conviction)}
<D>__{and no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.}
<A>__{he looks at leland for a minute and goes back to his writing, reading as he writes. bernstein has risen and crossed to one side of kane. they both stand looking out. leland joins him on the other side. their three heads are silhouetted against the sky. leland's head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into kane's face camera very close on this kane turns to him and we know their eyes have met, although their faces are almost in sillhouette. bernstein is still smoking a cigar.}
