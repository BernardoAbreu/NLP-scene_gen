<L>__{interior jail cell 2:30 am}
<A>__{the cell door slams. harold is behind bars.}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{hey, are you gonna do something about my car? hello?}
<A>__{palumbo is in the main office area, dealing with hippie asshole and his mom. the mom hands officer palumbo a check.}
<C>__{officer palumbo}
<D>__{thanks, mrs. ogelthorpe. your donation to our police charity is very appreciated.}
<C>__{hippie asshole's mom}
<D>__{well, thank you for being so understanding about bradley. i promise you he won't ever do it again.}
<C>__{officer palumbo}
<D>__{oh, i'm sure he won't. not after the talk we had, right brad?}
<A>__{officer palumbo gives hippie asshole a threatening look.}
<C>__{hippie asshole}
<P>__{(shaken)}
<D>__{mom please take me home...}
<A>__{the mom leaves, with hippie asshole clinging to her like a frightened child. palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk, where we see hippie asshole's big bag of weed, along with harold's wallet and laptop. he then starts filing a report on harold... harold looks at officer palumbo through the bars...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{can i at least give you my car's licence plate number?}
<A>__{ignoring harold, palumbo turns up the volume on his radio...}
<C>__{radio announcer}
<D>__{the search for the escaped cheetah continues tonight. it was last spotted in randolph township, heading south...}
<A>__{harold turns around and examines his cell. inside with him is a black man (tarik) sitting down, reading a book. harold sits down, across from tarik. while harold isn't looking, we see officer palumbo take the cash out of harold's wallet and pocket it.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{so what are you in here for?}
<C>__{tarik}
<D>__{for being black.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{come on. seriously.}
<A>__{tarik sits up. he looks at officer palumbo who, with his walkman on, is oblivious to their conversation.}
<C>__{tarik}
<D>__{i am serious. you wanna know what happened?}
<A>__{harold nods.}
<C>__{tarik}
<D>__{i was walking out of a barnes and noble, and a cop stops me. evidently, a black man robbed a store in newark. therefore, since i'm black, it was probably me, right?}
<A>__{harold shrugs his shoulders.}
<C>__{tarik}
<D>__{well that was the logic the cop used. i told him i haven't even been to newark in months. then he pointed a gun at me and told me to stop resisting arrest. i said, "hey, i'm not resisting anything." so he starts beating me with his gun, screaming at me, telling me to stop resisting.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{holy shit. what did you do?}
<C>__{tarik}
<D>__{i kept saying, "i understand that i'm under arrest. please stop beating me." but that didn't work. then another cop showed up. then another. when it was all said and done, it took nine cops to bring me in here.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{that fucking blows!}
<A>__{tarik nods and continues reading his book. harold sees that tarik is remarkably relaxed.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i don't understand how you're able to be so calm about all this.}
<C>__{tarik}
<D>__{son, i'm fat. i'm black. i can't dance. and i have two gay fathers. i've had people messing with me my whole life.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i learned a long time ago, there's no point in getting all riled up every time a bunchy of idiots gives you a hard time. because in the end, the universe tends to unfold as it should.}
<A>__{harold takes this all in.}
<C>__{tarik}
<D>__{so what are you in here for?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{assaulting an officer.}
<C>__{tarik}
<D>__{they tried to pin that shit on you too?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{no. i actually did hit the cop. but only because i was trying to hit my friend. well, ex friend.}
<A>__{suddenly, officer reilly hangs up the phone on his desk. he shouts out to the other officers in the room:}
<C>__{officer reilly}
<D>__{hey, listen up guys! multiple gun shots fired in millbrook park! it sounds bad!}
<C>__{officer palumbo}
<D>__{finally, some action! i'm going!}
<A>__{another cop, officer martone, gets up...}
<C>__{officer martone}
<D>__{no i'm going!}
<A>__{all six officers in the room jump out of their desks and run for the door. harold and tarik can't believe it.}
