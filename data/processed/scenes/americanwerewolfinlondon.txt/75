<A>__{he looks around and sees that there is a small window ajar on the side of the flat about eleven feet off the ground, which can be reached by climbing a brick wall, which he does but not without damage to his bare toes. at the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on seeing david. the hair stands up on its arched back and it glares at david, hissing and spitting. david is disturbed by the cat's hostile behavior.}
