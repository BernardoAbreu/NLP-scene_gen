<A>__{sequence from original script.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior house dawn}
<A>__{the camera moves up the stairs, into the bedroom. still o.s., we hear more heavy breathing... urgent whispers... lust... passion... squeaky bedsprings! a trail of clothes is scattered before us on the way to the bed... shoes, a dress, slip, bra, nylons, panties... greasy coveralls with a "frank kelbo mobile mechanic" namepatch, dirty work boots, a wrench and a gigantic grease gun... the bed shakes violently. a female voice calls the shots as various tools drop to the floor.}
<C>__{lana }
<D>__{oh yes, frank! adjust the stroke by ten percent! that's it.}
<P>__{(clunk! a wrench)}
<D>__{now tweak my points. oh yes, oh yes!}
<P>__{(thunk! pliers)}
<D>__{you got it! stabilize your ball joints and grind my rear differential!}
<P>__{(clink! screwdriver)}
<D>__{now accelerate! floor it! lay rubber, baby! vrrroooooooooommmmmmmmm!}
<A>__{a beat. the light clicks on. lana; a sexy redhead with a cool, manipulative edge, and frank; a slick, smarmy lothario, lay under the sheets, panting, glistening with sweat. lana reaches for a pack of "fatal 100's" on the bedside table.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{not bad for an auto mechanic...}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(grins, cocky)}
<D>__{yeah, well you're not so bad yourself... for a lawyer's wife...}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{better watch your tongue, sweetie, or i will have my husband arrest you.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{busy man. cop and a lawyer. when does he ever find time for you?}
<A>__{she lights a cigarette... exhales a soft, gloomy cloud.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{he doesn't. that's why i need you to keep my engine tuned, frank. why drive a jalopy when you can have a hot rod?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{maybe you should trade him in on a new model.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{i would... if i could make any money on the deal.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(reaches for her)}
<D>__{want to go for another test drive?}
<A>__{the sound of an automobile engine outside. lana stops him.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{pull over and park it, frank. i'm still under warranty.}
