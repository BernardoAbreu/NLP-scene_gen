<L>__{interior ucla screening room day (1965)}
<A>__{on the screen a 16mm black and white student film of a stunning blond in black bra, panties, garters dancing in black heels on top of a tv set. panning down to images of goose stepping nazis and a nuremberg rally on the set. sounds of lovemaking and an indian peyote ceremony from the track, an indian holy man incanting... jim's voice comes on the track as well.}
<C>__{jim's voice}
<D>__{nietzche said "all great things must first wear monstrous and terrifying masks in order to inscribe themselves on the hearts of humanity". listen children to the sound of the nuremberg night.}
<A>__{students in the audience groan at the pretention of it. moving to jim's eyes hidden in his parka hood, peeking through at the screen. a closeup now of jim on screen looking straight into the lens as he takes a hit on a hash pipe, and winks.}
<C>__{jim voice}
<P>__{(on screen)}
<D>__{have you ever seen god? a mandala. a symmetrical angel. felt? yes. fucking the sun. heard? the music. voices. touched? an animal. your hand tasted? rare meat, corn, water and wine}
<C>__{students}
<P>__{(ad lib)}
<D>__{ssssssss... ego trip man, c'mon!}
<A>__{ray manzarek, a tall student with powerful voice and manner, thick glasses, long hair sweeping down over his eyes, leans over to jim.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hey man it's great, don't listen to em, it's non linear man, it's poetry man, everything godard stands for.}
<A>__{the lights coming on as the last absurdist images flicker off. hissing and a big bronx cheer summarize the feelings of the 100 odd students crammed into a bunker like theater. a youngish instructor stirs to the front row from a row of upset faculty. hands shooting up to criticize.}
<C>__{instructor}
<D>__{this is pretty shocking stuff mr. morrison. and i might say indulgent. naziism and masturbation, when used for shock value, are not art. but to be constructive, let's start with your intention. what was it?}
<C>__{student 1}
<D>__{it was a bore!! that's what!}
<P>__{(laughter)}
<A>__{trick, bones and jack, three friends sitting next to jim, shoot their hands up.}
<C>__{trick}
<D>__{hey it was better'n a warhol picture.}
<C>__{girl 1}
<D>__{no it wasn't. it was worse!}
<C>__{trick}
<D>__{a guy sleeping for seven hours...}
<C>__{student 2}
<D>__{...is less pretentious! there was no political consciousness. naziism is...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey hold on man! you guys are the facists!}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{it takes genitalism to absurdity man, just cause the squares here can't dig it cause the film school's still so square...}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{oh c'mon man, give it a break. boo! beatniks go home! take another mushroom...}
<A>__{a cacophony of voices, critics, emotions blend out over jim's quiet eyes.}
<C>__{instructor}
<D>__{hold it down!!... mr. morrison what are your feelings?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i quit.}
<P>__{(walks out)}
