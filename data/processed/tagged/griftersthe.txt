<L>__{exterior ruidoso downs day}
<A>__{an angle establishing the race track, ruidoso downs (pronounced ree oh do so), set among the beautiful mountains of new mexico's lincoln national forest, as a white chrysler turns in with a stream of cars moving toward the parking area. an angle through the open driver side window of the chrysler at lilly dillon, 39 but looking younger, beautiful but cold and watchful. wide shot, track in b.g. as lilly parks the chrysler, gets out, locks the car. as she walks toward the track, wipe right, as scene two wipes in from the left. scene one camera follows lilly as she walks across the large parking area.}
<B>__{split screen.}
<T>__{scene two:}
<L>__{exterior side street day}
<A>__{downtown los angeles, near the courts and the business section. roy dillon, 25, handsome and charming but self indulgent, parks his orange honda convertible, gets out, picks up a large ledger book from the back seat, goes around to open the trunk. an angle on the trunk, establishing the tools of the salesman's trade: catalogs, samples, ledgers full of manuals and product sheets. roy adds the ledger from the back seat, shuts the trunk, walks away.}
<L>__{exterior 6th street day}
<A>__{roy walks around the corner near a bar restaurant. as he approaches it, wipe left, the two half width scenes contracting to one third each as scene three wipes in from the right. scene one: lilly approaches the track's entrance doors. scene two: roy approaches the bar.}
<T>__{scene three:}
<L>__{exterior santa monica boulevard day}
<A>__{a baby blue cadillac parks in front of a jeweler. an angle on the driver's door as myra langtry, 36, beautiful in an impersonal calculating way, gets out, carrying a small jewelry care, and locks the car. at first glance, myra looks rather like lilly. (myra always wears large dangly earrings, and usually wears big lensed dark sunglasses.)}
<T>__{simultaneously:}
<A>__{scene one: lilly enters the track. scene two: roy enters the bar. scene three: myra enters the jeweler's. wipe right and left, as scene two takes full screen.}
<L>__{interior bar day}
<A>__{an angle on a hurried bartender in a full bar, crowded with a noisy lunchtime crowd. in b.g., roy slithers his way to the bar, waving a bill in the air to attract the bartender's attention. an angle on roy as the bartender comes to him. roy puts the bill on the bar, holding it down with one finger, as he shouts his order. the bartender looks down. bartender's pov: roy's finger holds down a twenty dollar bill. an angle steep over roy's shoulder, the twenty visible, as the bartender hurries away to get the drink. roy's hand makes a fist, swallowing the twenty, opens, pushing a ten out onto the bar, holding it there with one finger. an angle on the bartender returning with a draft beer, nodding to other orders shouted to him along the way, putting the beer down, grabbing the bill without looking at it, hurrying away. an angle on roy, content, smiling, sipping his beer. an angle on the bartender, hurrying by, slapping roy's change down, moving on, roy nodding acknowledgement, reaching out. cu, the change, a ten dollar bill on top. roy's hand closes over it.}
<L>__{exterior tote board day}
<A>__{wide shot, the tote board at the track, showing the shifting odds on the horses for the next race, the amounts bet. close shot, number 3. not much bet, odds 70 1.}
<L>__{exterior ruidoso downs day}
<A>__{an angle on lilly, frowning at the tote board. she carries a large heavy shoulder bag, which she opens, looking in it as though it were a file drawer. an angle on lilly studying the contents of her bag, the track beyond her, the mountains visible out beyond the track wall. lilly moves. an angle on a high dollar betting window, as lilly approaches, taking bank banded wads of bills from her bag.}
<L>__{exterior tote board day}
<A>__{a change of numbers sweeps across the board.}
<L>__{exterior ruidoso downs day}
<A>__{lilly moves away from the betting window, tucking betting tickets into her bag. ecu, lilly's bag, compartmented, with stacks of money, small envelopes and notes on notepaper in each compartment. lilly carefully files the betting slips. an angle on lilly looking out at the tote board.}

<C>__{caller }
<D>__{and they're off!}
<L>__{interior jeweler's office day}
<A>__{very quiet, stately; abrupt contrast with the track. a slow ticking clock. myra sits in the client's chair, while at the desk sits the jeweler, a pleasant but overweight man of 40, who studies a jeweled bracelet through a loupe. he sighs, drops the loupe, shakes his head regretfully.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{mrs. langtry, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{why? what's wrong?}
<C>__{jeweler}
<P>__{(personal emotion mixed in)}
<D>__{you are a valued customer, as you know.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{but what's wrong?}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{i can't understand a thing like this. it's something you almost never see.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{what is?}
<C>__{jeweler}
<P>__{(holding up bracelet)}
<D>__{this is some of the finest filigreed platinum i've ever seen. but the stones, no. they're not diamonds, mrs. langtry.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{but they must be! they cut glass!}
<C>__{jeweler}
<P>__{(wry)}
<D>__{glass will cut glass, mrs. langtry. do you know where it was purchased?}
<L>__{interior hotel room day}
<A>__{an expensive hotel room, with a sunstruck day beyond the windows. myra, naked, a few years younger, sits cross legged on the bed and laughs at cole "farmer" langley, 55, stringy bodied, who stands naked, his back to us, hands on hips, presenting himself to myra. she reaches forward, hand hidden by his body as she lifts something that was hanging on something at the front of him. she brings back the bracelet, looks at it, is delighted, puts it on, and then leans forward again toward the unmoving cole, her head hidden by his body.}
<L>__{interior jeweler's office day}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{it was a gift. it isn't worth anything at all?}
<C>__{jeweler}
<P>__{(warm, encouraging)}
<D>__{why, of course it is. i can offer you well, five hundred dollars.}
<A>__{myra expected and needed a lot more. she's worried, tense, but stuck. she nods.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{i will get you a check.}
<A>__{he leaves the room. myra grimaces, in almost physical pain.}
<L>__{interior second bar day}
<A>__{another crowded lunchtime bar. a big beefy bartender moves quickly, carrying a draft beer. an angle on roy, in position, finger holding bill down, as the bartender arrives, puts down the beer, reaches for the bill, stops, stares at the bill. two shot, the bartender and roy, as the bartender gives roy a very cold look. he knows, and roy knows he knows. roy tries an innocent smile, which doesn't work. roy moves. cu, the ten dollar bill, as roy grabs it, but the bartender simultaneously grabs roy's wrist. an angle on roy and the bartender as roy tries to pull away and the bartender holds him with his left hand while reaching under the bar with his right. he comes up with a sawed off baseball bat. roy, seeing it, throws his free arm up to protect his head, but the bartender pushes the blunt end of the bat straight across the bar at a downward angle and hard into roy's solar plexus, driving the air out of him and propelling him back away from the bar, leaving the ten. the nearest customers on both sides become aware that something happened, but nothing follows and they're already involved in conversations. the bartender scoops up the ten as he puts the bat away under the bar. an angle on roy, arms folded across his torso, staring in shock toward the bar, where the space he filled has already been closed in by other bodies. nearly retching, he stumbles toward the door.}
<L>__{exterior ruidoso downs day}
<A>__{an angle on four people at a table, cheering a race, switching to disgust and despair when they lose, moving away from the table, leaving their betting tickets behind. lilly passes by, smoothly and casually scoops up the tickets, moves on along a row of tables, and there finding more tickets.}
<L>__{interior jeweler's office day}
<A>__{myra sits as before. the jeweler enters with a check, which he hands her. she looks up at him, making no move to leave.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{i hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, mrs. langtry.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{it's not your fault.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{you'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, i hope. if there's anything you think we might be interested in...}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{i have only one thing now. are you interested?}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{well, i'd have to see it, of course.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{you are seeing it. you're looking right at it.}
<A>__{the jeweler is puzzled, then startled.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{he turns away, goes behind his desk, sits down, looks at myra.}
<C>__{jeweler}
<D>__{you know something, mrs. langtry? a bracelet like that very rarely happens. a fine setting and workmanship usually mean precious stones. it always hurts me when i find they're not. i always hope }
<P>__{(faint sad friendly smile)}
<D>__{ i'm mistaken.}
<A>__{myra likes him better now, even though he hasn't solved her problem. she rises.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{thank you. for everything you felt you could do.}
<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{roy has been throwing up but is finished now. he's sprawled like a shot deer across the hood of his honda, still clutching his stomach. a police car stops, the passenger cop gets out. he's suspicious at first.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{sir? everything all right?}
<A>__{the sight of the uniform forces roy into gear. he straightens, smiling through his pain.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{getting better. a bad shrimp, i think.}
<A>__{the con's suspicion changes to concern.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{want us to take you to a doctor?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{no no, i'm fine now, thanks, anyway. still got a lot of clients to see.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{take it easy, now.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{oh, i will.}
<L>__{exterior ruidoso downs day}
<A>__{late afternoon. an angle on the parking area, where almost all the cars are gone and the few remaining are widely separated. the white chrysler is one of these. lilly walks to it from the track entrance. an angle on the chrysler as lilly opens the trunk, puts her bag inside. close up, lilly and the trunk. she takes betting tickets from her bag, sorts them, files them in envelopes in different compartments, puts some to one side, then sorts through these separated tickets, throwing some away, keeping some. she takes money from the bag, puts tickets in, closes the bag with the money on the trunk floor. reaching farther in, she lifts the pad deep inside the trunk, lifts the metal floor panel, and reveals a cache mostly filled with money. she adds today's skim, puts everything away, puts the bag back on her shoulder, closes the trunk.}
<L>__{exterior madero apartments day}
<A>__{a shabby apartment hotel on wilshire. an exterior hall balcony on each floor has the entrance doors to the front apartments. roy's honda makes the turn and enters the basement garage.}
<L>__{interior madero lobby day}
<A>__{modest but clean. the owner, simms, a sloppy garrulous old bore, talks with a potential renter.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{put it this way, now. say i rent to a woman, well, she has to have a room with a bath. i insist on it, because otherwise she's got the hall bath tied up all the time, washing her goddamn hair and her clothes and everything she can think of.}
<A>__{in b.g., roy, still in pain, comes out of the elevator, waves to simms, who waves back without pausing in his monologue, and crosses to the mailboxes.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{now, your minimum for a room with bath is three hundred a month, just for a place to sleep and no cooking allowed. and just how many of these tootsies make that kind of money and have to eat in restaurants and buy clothes and }
<A>__{roy, carrying his junk mail and pretending not to be in pain, crosses to simms.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{mr. simms.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(fawning)}
<D>__{why yes, mr. dillon. here's a potential new neighbor, looking at }
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(uninterested)}
<D>__{uh huh. mrs. langtry may drop by.}
<A>__{simms doesn't like mrs. langtry, but can't say so.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{i will send her right up.}
<A>__{roy goes back to the elevator. simms continues his monologue.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{i had my first hotel thirty seven years ago in wichita falls, texas, and that's where i began to learn about women. they just don't make the money, you see, not regular they don't, and there's only one way they can get it.}
<A>__{roy enters the elevator.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{now, that mr. dillon there, that's the fine type of person i have in mind for here. like yourself, i have no doubt. he's a salesman, regular as clockwork, has a suite here. fine man. now, about these women. at first, you know, they just go out and do it now and then, just enough to make ends meet. but pretty soon they got that bank open twenty four hours a day, and then you've got trouble. hookers and hotellin' just don't mix. you'd think the cops'd be too busy catching real criminals, not snooping around after working girls, but that's the way the gravy stains, as the saying is, and i don't fight it. an ounce of prevention is my motto.}
<A>__{myra enters from the front, looks across at simms, points upward. simms calls to her.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{oh, yes, mrs. langtry, he's up there, he's expecting you.}
<A>__{myra crosses to the elevator. simms speaks more softly.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{if you keep out the women in the first place, see, you keep out the hookers, and then you keep out the cops, and that's how you have a clean place.}
<L>__{exterior roy's apartment day}
<A>__{an angle along the balcony, with roy's apartment door in f.g. and los angeles in b.g. myra crosses to the door, opens it with her key, enters.}
<L>__{interior bathroom day}
<A>__{a small crowded old fashioned bathroom. roy, shirt open and trousers pushed down almost to his crotch, looks in the mirror at purplish greenish bruises on his stomach. he touches his stomach, winces.}
<C>__{myra }
<D>__{roy?}
<A>__{he looks at the door, then grins at his reflection.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{your medicine is here.}
<A>__{he leaves the bathroom.}
<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{hotel furniture, shabby and anonymous. on the walls, contrasting with everything else, are two crying clown pictures on black velvet, mounted in big boxy frames. myra stands in the middle of the room, and roy enters, shirt and trousers still disarranged.}
<C>__{myra}
<P>__{(amused by clothing)}
<D>__{well, well. in a real hurry, are we?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{always, for you, baby.}
<A>__{he reaches for her, but she playfully holds him off.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{you aren't taking me for granted, are you?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{taking you for granite?}
<A>__{he grins, as his fingertip prods her breast.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{that isn't granite. if that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.}
<C>__{myra}
<P>__{(playing along)}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(pulling her close)}
<D>__{let's find out.}
<L>__{exterior highway phone booth day}
<A>__{lilly's white chrysler is parked next to an open air phone. traffic whizzes by. lilly talks on the phone, with pen and notebook at the ready. the racetrack is visible in the b.g.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i'm done here. do i come back to baltimore?}
<L>__{interior office day}
<A>__{it could be an expensive, if gaudy, lawyer's office. baltimore harbor is visible past the windows. irv, the accountant, sits at a desk covered but neatly covered with ledgers, computer printouts, etc. he speaks on the phone.}
<C>__{irv}
<D>__{bobo wants you to go on to delmar.}
<L>__{intercut phone booth and office:}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{delmar? i never go out to california. that's a thousand miles from here.}
<C>__{irv}
<D>__{nine hundred. bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. come on, lilly, you don't argue with bobo.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(fatalistic)}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{irv}
<D>__{take two, three days. call when you get there.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{maybe i will swing around los ang gleez on the way.}
<A>__{this is lilly making the best of the situation. she listens a bit more, grunts a farewell, hangs up, moves to her car.}
<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{again, anonymous hotel furniture. roy and myra naked in bed, he on his back, she straddling him, both moving gently. he's half feeling pleasure, half unconscious.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{roy?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{mm?}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{look at me.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{oh, i am, baby, believe me.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{roy? it this all we have?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{all? it ain't bad.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{no more than this?}
<A>__{he tries to concentrate on her.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{what are you talking abut, myra? marriage?}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{i didn't say that. you aren't marriage material.}
<A>__{he keeps watching her, ironic, hips moving. looking for a distraction, she notices the bruise on his stomach.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{she touches it; he flinches back, in real pain.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{ow! hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?}
<C>__{myra}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{no, baby. come to mama.}
<A>__{she folds forward onto him. he puts his arms around her. they rock together slowly.}
<L>__{exterior motel day}
<A>__{the same mountains in b.g. as at the track. lilly carries two small bags from her motel room, puts them on the back seat of the cadillac, gets behind the wheel, drives away.}
<L>__{interior bathroom day}
<A>__{myra, dressed, primps at the mirror, surveys herself critically, is reasonably satisfied, leaves.}
<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{roy lies supine on the bed, semi conscious, half covered by a sheet. myra, casual, not noticing his condition, leans her head in through the doorway.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{wore you out, did i? it's a good woman you can't keep down, baby.}
<A>__{he moves fitfully, croaks an attempt at speech.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{have a good sleep, baby. call you tomorrow.}
<A>__{he sits up, trying to grin and be easy.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{wait'll next year.}
<A>__{an angle across roy's profile, with open bedroom door beyond him. through it, the living room and outer door can be seen. myra crosses the living room, opens the door. bright sunlight pours in, emphasizing the sweat on his face. she closes the door, and he gives up trying to smile. gingerly, he touches his bruised stomach, winces.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{damn that guy.}
<A>__{he's going to get out of bed, but movement creates pain. he sits back against the headboard, looks around, reaches painfully to the bedside table drawer, takes a quarter from it, studies the quarter, feels it with fingertips, places it on the back of his left hand, slowly moves the soft pads of his right palm over it, then turns the quarter over and repeats. then he takes the quarter in his right hand, flips it, slaps it down onto the back of his left hand, speaks simultaneously with the hands coming together.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{smack.}
<A>__{he looks away, right hand moving minimally on left hand.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{heads.}
<A>__{he lifts the right hand, nods, then flips the coin again, looks away, moves the right hand slightly.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{heads.}
<A>__{again he's right. again he repeats.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{tails.}
<A>__{he's about to repeat when a wave of weakness comes over him. he sits back, gasping, but won't acknowledge the problem. he forces himself to flip the coin, misses catching it, finds it on the blanket, flips it again, slaps it onto the back of the other hand, looks away.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{tails.}
<A>__{right again. he prepares to flip the coin, but then his hand sags onto the covers, his chin drops, his eyes glaze.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{how much can i bet?}
<L>__{interior passenger train day}
<A>__{the train runs through a forest, tree shadows making a light and dark pattern. roy, four or five years younger, sits with a three core monte gang, consisting of a dealer, a spectacled shill beside him, roy facing the dealer, a roper next to roy. on a briefcase on the dealer's lap are three cards, face up: an ace and two deuces. across the aisle, alone in the seats, sits mintz, a conman in his fifties, pretending not to watch, but watching with amusement.}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{that's between you two. i got nothing at stake here, i'm just dealing.}
<C>__{shill}
<D>__{what if we both guess wrong? you aren't gonna take...}
<A>__{the dealer turns aside, allowing himself to be distracted. he and the shill argue nonsensically. the roper nudges roy, then reaches out and crimps the ace. roy's doing a wide eyed bumpkin kid; he stares at the roper in delight and amazement. an angle on the shill, arguing with the dealer but looking toward roy and the roper, then increasing the force of his argument. an angle across the amused mintz at the roper whispering to roy. two shot, roy and the roper.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{we got him now! put down that big bill you got.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{the fifty or the hundred?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{the hundred! hurry!}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(doubtful)}
<D>__{the ace is what i want?}
<A>__{the roper's having trouble keeping his patience.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{sure it is!}
<A>__{two shot, the dealer and the shill, fake squabbling, roy and the roper seen in b.g. between their faces, roy finally bringing out his wallet, withdrawing a bill. relieved, the dealer and the shill cut the crap. an angle on the group as roy puts his hundred dollar bill on the briefcase.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{is that okay?}
<A>__{the shill pulls a messy wad of bills from his inner pocket, uses most of it to cover the bet.}
<C>__{shill}
<D>__{you're damn right that's okay.}
<C>__{dealer}
<P>__{(picks up the cards)}
<D>__{whoever finds the ace, wins.}
<A>__{ecu, the dealer's hands, shuffling the cards at lightning speed. he deals the cards out face down.}
<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{cu, roy's sweat covered face, eyelids fluttering.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{dark in here.}
<L>__{interior passenger train day}
<A>__{an angle on the group. roy squints at the cards, light and dark playing on his face.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{too dark. i just can't see.}
<A>__{casually, but too quickly to be stopped, he reaches across and plucks the shill's glasses off.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{let me borrow these, will you?}
<A>__{an angle across mintz, surprised and amused, at the group in b.g., in consternation as roy puts on the glasses and looks down at the cards.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{now, that's better.}
<A>__{roy's pov: the glasses are 'readers.' through them, a large gray 'a' can be seen on the back of one of the non crimped cards. roy's hand reaches out and flips it over. it's the ace of spades.}
<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{an angle across roy toward the doorway. roy, eyes closed, smiles in triumph, then winces in pain. mintz partially appears, hovering beside the bed, grinning at roy.}
<C>__{mintz}
<D>__{i didn't teach you that.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{you taught me a lot. then i invented.}
<L>__{interior airport departure lounge day}
<A>__{weary bored people sit around waiting. roy, 17, lugging a big suitcase, walks through, takes a seat near mintz, who's doing card tricks for his own pleasure. roy watches, then moves closer.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{let me see how you did that one.}
<C>__{mintz}
<D>__{scram. go home.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i can't. i just left home.}
<C>__{mintz}
<D>__{you're too young. you should be in school.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i am in school.}
<A>__{mintz peers at him, taking an interest. then he holds up the five of spades, shows it to roy, puts it back in the deck, shuffles, shows roy the deck.}
<C>__{mintz}
<D>__{where's the five?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{in your other hand.}
<A>__{mintz grins slowly, turns his hand over with the palmed card showing.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{roy slumps, eyes closed, half smiling, with the fever mintz hovering. roy's smile fades, his fluttering eyelids grow still, his face slack. the fever mintz fades and disappears.}
<L>__{exterior highway day}
<A>__{an angle on a large sign indicating "los angeles" straight ahead. camera pans down and around 180 degrees to face the several lanes of heavy los angeles bound traffic. long beat. hundreds of cars rush by. camera pans with lilly's white chrysler as it comes along in the stream. an angle through the chrysler's left side window at lilly, driving, concentrating, biting her left thumbnail. she becomes aware that's what she's doing, shakes her head in irritation: she's trying to break herself of this habit. ostentatiously she tucks the thumb into her fist, rests the fist on top of the steering wheel, where she can keep an eye on it. high angle on the westbound lanes. the chrysler passes. soon it's out of sight among all the other cars. long beat.}

<P>__{(not worth discussing)}
<D>__{never.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{no, i guess not. it was pretty lousy of me, i guess, to be a child at the same time you were. not to stop being a child just because i had a child. i guess i was a real stinker not to be a grown up when you needed a grown up.}

<C>__{roy}
<D>__{what do you want me to do? pin a halo on you? you're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.}

<D>__{and making you feel bad at the same time, huh? but that's the way i am, you know, the way i've always been. always picking on poor little roy.}

<D>__{you're getting off the grift?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{that's right.}

<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
