<L>__{exterior woods evening}
<A>__{della runs for her life. she makes straight for the cover of the trees. she hesitates for just a moment after the first layer of pines. it's pitch black beyond. then she steps in. she follows her breath into the icy blackness. branches and foliage scratch against her face. she grapples about, looking for hiding places between the dark shapes and forms. steps between tree roots and shrubs. her eyes begin to adjust. she can now make out the difference between the clumps of darkness and tell, looking back, where the edge of the woods begins. a construction light shines behind like a distant moon. she pushes between the branches of indistinguishable trees, some thick and knotted, others slight and brittle. only the evergreens still have their foliage. looking back constantly to the edge of the trees for a sign of the boys. fear drives her further into the woods towards where the trees grow even more densely together. where there just may be the right place to hide. she stops for a second to catch her breath. the handle of the toolbox has chaffed her right palm. she changes hands. god, that boy huey! he really died back there. she heard the sound of it. the horrific sound of him dying a stupid pointless death. it could have been her. there has to be some way out of this nightmare. ahead, a dead tree with spectral branches blocks her path. she steps around its huge trunk and tangle of roots.}

<A>__{chuckie's voice drifts towards her. she ducks down among the roots. her eyes scan the darkness. no moving shapes nor forms. no sound. no flashlight. just shadowy clumps of trees. should she stay put or should she run? then she sees it. the flashlight weaving through the pines ahead. she pushes further in among the roots, tries to make herself invisible. the flashlight beam sweeps across the forest floor towards her. one set of footsteps crunches through the foilage. she holds still, terrified. the flashlight pauses on the dead tree, the roots. della stops breathing. then, the light sweeps past and on into the woods. she waits until it disappears before stepping out of her hiding place. she creeps back in the opposite direction, figuring if they're in the woods now she should get out. her eyes search for the construction light, which indicates the edge of the wood. she heads in the direction of the light, painfully aware that one noisy footfall could alert her pursuers. she steps between leaves and roots as delicately as a ballet dancer. the construction light grows closer. the light abruptly goes out. she stops, eyes desperately searching the trees. she resumes in the direction she was headed. tries to keep calm. but the woods are impenetrable. layers of trees and shrubs, and then more trees. deep in the cold dark places there are patches of left over snow. she's losing her bearings.}
