<A>__{a shaft of light penetrates the darkness of a room... growing larger as the door swings open. ellen steps in first followed by maurice. ellen goes straight for the blinds. burst of light stab the room. the spines of the books catch the light... rows and rows of books cradled by a maze of mahogany book shelves. this is an old fashioned store with antique chairs at select places. a coffee table sits near the window with a set of deep cushioned sofa chairs. this store is a home... maurice moves behind the counter and turns on the radio. chopin flows from the old speakers atop the corner shelves delicately. ellen opens the door to the store and locks it in that position with a slanted piece of wood... the store is now open.}
