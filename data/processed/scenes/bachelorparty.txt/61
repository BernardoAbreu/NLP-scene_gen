<C>__{rick}
<D>__{nick, if you would be so kind...}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{he holds the tray with one hand. with the other he reaches out of frame. in a nutshell, what he does is place his honker in the hot dog bun. as he slaps his business into the bun, we hear a solid thump.}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{and then some.}
<A>__{mrs. t. grabs the hot dog. it won't come off the tray. she yanks harder. nick drops the tray and mrs. t. finally comes to realize what she is pulling on. she screams in terror. because of sheer fright, she can't seem to drop nick's schlong from her grip. the rest of our ladies look to see mrs. t. 's hot dog. they scream in shock. debbie spits out her marguerita, hitting phoebe in the face.}
<B>__{our guys}
