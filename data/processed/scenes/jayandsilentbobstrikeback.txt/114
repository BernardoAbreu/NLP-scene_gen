<C>__{clark}
<D>__{once sean told you it wasn't your fault, you lost the edge, william. you stopped hitting the books with a vengeance, and now i've read shit you haven't even heard about yet. face facts, my friend love made you a soft little pussy boy, unable to stand up to an academic showdown, like you used to. you're just no longer that good will hunting.}
