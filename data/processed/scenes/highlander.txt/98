<L>__{exterior rural pay phone day}
<A>__{a plain clothed police officer is in mid conversation.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{no, that's the last place we saw her. okay, will do.}
<A>__{he hangs up.}
<C>__{partner}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{officer}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{we keep looking.}
<C>__{partner}
<D>__{wonderful.}
<L>__{interior farmhouse day}
<A>__{taupin sits at his desk. before him is spread out blank birth certificates, driver licenses and title deeds. his eyes lift to the corridor where brenna is. an idea has come to him. brenna enters.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{what's all that?}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{richard taupin has become cumbersome. it would be best if he just disappeared.}
<A>__{brenna walks to the window.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{you did kill those men.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{not all of them.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{when you finish, what then?}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{i go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad mr. taupin.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{you make it all sound so simple.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{the only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property i've aquired. that requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in gettysburg. but that's where you come in.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{you want me to front for you.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{the less exposure i recieve around government buildings the better. you, as mrs. taupin, will attract considerably less attention than i.}
<A>__{brenna is unsure.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{not such a bad trade. the story of a lifetime for a few days work?}
