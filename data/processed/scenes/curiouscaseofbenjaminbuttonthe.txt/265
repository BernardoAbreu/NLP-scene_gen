<A>__{it's quiet...just the wind knocking...she looks at her mother...but daisy's staring, somewhere else...}

<P>__{(takes up reading again...)}

<L>__{260 62 omit 260 62 interior the dance studio, new orleans another night, 1980}
<A>__{a record's playing piano music. classes are done. parents taking their children. we see daisy, in her long skirt... helping pick up with her hands and her nimble toes, errant clothing, the jackets, the sweaters... it takes us a moment to recognize her... in the some twelve years since we've last seen her, 56 now, her hair's cut short... and it's gone mostly gray... and, although her age is on her face, she still has a dancer's posture, her head held high... carrying herself with grace... and one thing that will never change, are her unforgettable blue eyes... we hear the door opening... daisy, busy gathering, saying her goodnights... glances toward the door across the studio... and she sees a young man has come in, a young man in his twenties... standing silently, a stranger, standing by the door... daisy, as she closes up the studio, makes her way toward him, saying goodnight to people... she bends to pick up a ballet slipper...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{somebody left their slipper...}
<A>__{daisy looks over, the young man hasn't moved... the studio has all but emptied... she walks toward him... he's wearing worn trousers, a coat that's seen better days...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{are you here to pick someone up?}
<A>__{he shakes "no." coming closer....}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{i'm sorry, we're closed now.}
<A>__{she moves to open the door to show him out... when she gets a good look at him. she stops, realizing who it is...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{benjamin?}
<A>__{...and she's taken aback by his youth, we all are... sixteen years younger... in his 20s now... it's at once staggering and heartbreaking... what age can do... and she realizes, at that very moment, he was right all along...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{you're so young.}
<A>__{they look at each other... when she's able to find the words...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{why did you come back?}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{i wanted to see you both.}
<A>__{she stares at him... just the piano music. and despite the gulf of time... there's a terrible aching they have for each other... and before they can say anything... the door swings open and caroline, 12, comes hurrying in...}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you ready, mom?}
<A>__{benjamin stares at her appearance... and daisy, can't help herself, and seeing caroline, daisy, overcome by it all, starts to cry.}
<C>__{caroline }
<D>__{is something wrong, mother?}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{no... he was telling me a very sad story about a mutual friend we hadn't seen in a long time... this is my friend, benjamin... you knew him when you were... just a baby...}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{hi...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{hello...}
<A>__{he reaches, taking her hand... needing to touch her...}
<C>__{a man's }
<D>__{hello...}
<A>__{and a man 50s, wearing a suit and a tie, comes in...}
<C>__{the man}
<D>__{i'm sorry... i thought you were done...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{this is a friend of my family's... benjamin button... this is my husband... robert...}
<A>__{they shake hands... there's an awkward quiet...}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{it was nice to have met you... we'll be in the car, darling...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{i'm just closing up...}
<A>__{and robert and caroline go outside to wait for her...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{she's so lovely... she looks like you... does she dance?}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{not very well.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{i suppose that would be from my side of things. `daisy she's a dear sweet girl... she seems a little lost... but who isn't a little lost at 12? there's a lot of her that reminds me of you.}
<A>__{and she shuts off a set of the lights.}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{my husband. he's a doctor... was a widower... he's an incredibly bright, adventurous man...}
<A>__{benjamin smiles.}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{he's been a terrific father... and a great partner and friend...}
<A>__{and she shuts off the record player and another set of lights... and for a moment they stand in the dark studio... and they look at their reflections in the mirror... seeing who they are now...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{you're so much younger.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{just what you can see.}
<A>__{she looks at him, and after all these years... she now understands completely... she looks outside at her daughter standing by the car with her "father," waiting...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{you ware right. she needed a father. i couldn't have raised both of you. i'm not that strong.}
<A>__{he's quiet. they both are. she looks at him.}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{i never thought how it must have broken your heart, too.}
<A>__{his silence is enough.}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{where are you staying? what are you going to do?}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{i'm at the pontchartrain hotel on the avenue. i have no idea what i'm going to do.}
<A>__{and it seems like they want to hold each other. but they can't. it's still. and aware of the car's headlights waiting at the curb... she turns, holding the door open for him...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{i have to go.}
<A>__{he nods. he walks by her, going out.}
