<A>__{frank and dorothy are in the front seat. jeffrey is sandwiched between two very dirty strange guys in the back. frank is driving very fast and very crazy. sitting next to him on the front seat is a police radio which periodically blares out police reports. at the lights, when they turn green, frank lays rubber.}

<D>__{yeah. we gotta see ben.}
<A>__{the car roars through a seedy street lined with bars and clubs. liquor and sex shop signs glow in hot neon colors. they are blurred visions because of the speed of frank's car. driving music plays. frank careens dangerously down various narrow streets, just barely making turns. the ford bounces off several curbs. dorothy occasionally steals a glance back at jeffrey. she squeals out loud sometimes with glee, mostly in fear. raymond and paul laugh with frank, yell out or light cigarettes.}
