<A>__{blinding in their white uniforms, naval flag officers sit in the audience, showing their support for theodore hayes, a 50 year old civilian. this is his confirmation hearing. reading from prepared material:}

<D>__{... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land based maritime specialties. what's more, the navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on }

<D>__{whoa, whoa, whoa. "land based maritime specialties." gimme a second here to de euphemize that...}
<A>__{at the center of a dais, lillian dehaven leans back to ponder the ceiling of the hearing room. her plaque card reads "chairperson senate arms committee." dehaven is a tough hided old southern belle, scarlett o'hara at 60. in her arsenal she carries conversational hand grenades and she's apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{would that be anything like "typing"? "restocking the cupboards"? that sort of thing, mr. hayes?}
<A>__{chuckles from the packed gallery. the flag officers go stone faced. hayes forces a smile.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{hardly the case, senator.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{well, i'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if i jump right in here before they discontinue my blood type. i am deeply concerned over the navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military. case in pointerior..}
<A>__{on cue, aides begin distributing reports to other members of the dais. hayes gets a copy, too. and it jars him.}

<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{madam senator... this is an internal document of the u.s. navy. i must seriously question whether }

<P>__{(to hayes)}
<D>__{you're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am i right?}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{i was one member of the investigating commission.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{yes, i see your signature right here twice the size of everyone else's. and your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{i'm really not prepared for any kind of in depth review of }
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{i'd like to think our next secretary of the navy would be prepared for anything, mr. hayes.}
<A>__{a humorless smile. she's roasting his nuts over an open fire, and everyone knows it.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{the commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{that aside for the moment, i'm struck by the tenor, the ill spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.}
<P>__{(closing report)}
<D>__{in my seven years on this committee, i've never seen a downed aviator treated like this. never. i'm deeply disturbed by this report, mr. hayes. not just what it bodes for women in the military but for your own confirmation as well.}
