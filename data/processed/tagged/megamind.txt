<D>__{you look so peaceful from up here.}
<A>__{his serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud beeping sound coming from his wrist. he looks down at a bracelet (a manly one) on his right arm. it's a silver band with a flashing red letter "u".}

<D>__{the real einstein once said, "god does not play dice with the world." he was right, because the world is my dice. is that understood? da vinci & plato sir! yes, sir!}

<D>__{i knew it! prepare yourselves! he's gonna ram us!!!}
<A>__{everyone scatters and braces themselves for the impact. master mind, seeing all the good places taken, doesn't know what to do with himself. he just covers his giant head with his hands. the figure crashes through the window and lands at his feet. he looks down to see a charred black human skeleton. around its neck is the unmistakable black cape of uberman.}

<A>__{it's heading for downtown metro as master mind and the lackeys coolly look on. three large dump trucks pull up, filled to the brim with bricks of cash. the drivers jump out as the lackeys take the driver seats in the three trucks. master mind is about to climb into the passenger seat of one when a drivers taps him on the shoulder and motions toward the tornado.}

<D>__{oh, right.}
<A>__{master mind pulls a television remote from his pocket and aims it at approaching windstorm of death. he presses the button marked "tornado off." the tornado shrinks and disappears just before it hits the city. as they drive through the city streets, master stares out the window with a hint of something in his eyes. is it melancholy?}

<A>__{hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants. hal's face he stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. the inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. a content look washes over his face. there is a distinct sound of porcelain cracking and}

<C>__{hal }
<D>__{oh, god!}
<A>__{he aims back for the toilet, which is pretty much rubble now, to see the floor give way. finally, the pee stops and he glances down the hole. he sees his downstairs neighbor sitting at his breakfast table. he has a fork halfway to his mouth as he stares at the smashed toilet on his pancakes.}

<D>__{you know, you're not at all like you are in the movies. "john cusack" i'm not?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{yeah. i don't know you have this strange, refined way of speaking. "john cusack" i do? that is most interesting.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{anyway, when we were talking the other day i just felt, even though we only talked for a couple of hours, that we've known each other for years. "john cusack" i know just what you mean.}
<A>__{roxanne bites into her sandwich.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{you know what? this sandwich is disgusting.}
<A>__{she tosses it in a nearby garbage can.}
<C>__{roxanne }
<D>__{of course i already ate half of it. i wonder what that says about my character? "john cusack" it means you don't give up on a sandwich. you see that it has potential, and you give it every chance to be all it can be.}
<A>__{roxanne smiles at his analogy.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{thanks, but knowing me, i was probably projecting my expectations of what a lunch should be on the sandwich. it might have been okay at first, but i just made it bitter.}
<A>__{john cusack notices roxanne's smile starting to fade.}
<D>__{"john cusack" is that what happened with your last sandwich i mean, boyfriend?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{when i look back, i probably shouldn't of expected so much from him. he was already a giving person. you know, one of those go out and save the world types. "john cusack" i've run into a few.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{i was selfish, i guess. i didn't want to share him with anybody else. "john cusack" it sounds like he was a special man.}

<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{well, what about your mentor?}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{tell you the truth? he was kind of a dick. i mean, being a hero is dandy and all, but it's volunteer work. now you've always had the right take on all this. i mean, when you rob a bank or take over the diamond exchange you get something out of it. i mean, when you don't get caught, which, no offense, isn't very often. and that brings me to what i wanted to propose to you: who could catch you if i'm by your side?}

<D>__{master, why must we flee?}

<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{no...i guess you are a coward after all.}
<A>__{suddenly, there's a loud crash. roxanne looks up to see a huge hunk of her ceiling has been completely ripped off. titan is flying above, holding the debris as casually as if it were a paper plate at a barbecue. he looks down at her and smiles.}

<C>__{titan}
<D>__{or maybe on the hips, like this.}
<A>__{it's the classic superman pose, only not as masculine.}

<A>__{the painting's menacing stare seems to reach into his very soul.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{anyway...you raised me to be the worst that i could possibly be. and i've tried to live up to that as best as i could even dropping out of dentistry school like you wanted me to. but i'm about to do something now that would really piss you off. i'm going to go against everything you ever taught me. i hope...i hope that maybe you'll look down at what i'm about to do as not so much a good deed, but more like the outright defiance of a hateful and ungrateful, son. if you could do that, then maybe in your own little way you could for probably the first time find a reason to be proud of me.}
<A>__{he looks back up at the picture. is it our imagination, or does the painting's stare suddenly seem even angrier?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{well...either way, you're probably going to see me real soon.}

<A>__{titan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main street.}
<B>__{roxanne}

<B>__{elsewhere}
<A>__{a flustered titan lands. he begins searching the city streets, but master mind is nowhere in sight. he turns upon hearing an eeking sound to his left. sitting on the ground is a chimpanzee wearing a strange collar. it smiles at him.}

<D>__{no more games.}
<A>__{titan fires his laser vision at master mind's chest. master mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a fire hydrant. titan's eye lasers burn through the hydrant releasing a high pressure stream of water. master mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of cement mix into the truck. the crowd, police and news crews move in closer when titan doesn't emerge. master mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck cautiously.}
