<L>__{exterior roof night}
<A>__{it is raining. raizo, still wearing his bloody clothes, climbs up onto the roof, his clothes spattered with gore. he waits as the shadows around him come to life: ozunu, takeshi, and several other clan members surround him. all but ozunu wear their masks. raizo extends his hand, revealing the black and gold watch, smeared with fresh blood. he offers it to mr. ozunu.}
<C>__{ozunu}
<D>__{keep it. it will remind you that every minute of your life is a gift that i have given you.}
<A>__{ozunu smiles.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{you have made me proud tonight, raizo. there are some who believed you would fail, but i knew you would not.}
<A>__{his eyes narrow.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{you have a strength inside you raizo. you must use that strength, now to show me that you are truly ozunu.}
<A>__{several of the other ninjas step back. revealing takeshi. he pushes a small hooded figure forward.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{weakness compels strength. betrayal begets blood.}
<A>__{takeshi yanks the hood off revealing a young girl. she is bloody, bound and gagged and for a flash raizo sees her as kiriko.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{a daughter that turned her back on her family. she tried to run. takeshi hunted her down.}
<A>__{he unsheathes his blade, offering the hilt to raizo.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{it is the law of the nine clans.}
<A>__{raizo looks at the girl, her tears lost in the rain. we cannot tell if raizo is crying as he takes the blade he cries out, the light of madness in his eyes. he strikes, lashing out with the fury of a wild animal, at ozunu who bends back with impossible grace. but not far enough. the point of raizo's sword slashes across his face, opening an ugly wound that spills blood over his eye and mouth... he hasn't tasted his own blood in years, and the anger boils up in his eyes.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{kill him!}
<A>__{raizo meets their attack. throwing himself into the fray as only a man who is no longer interested in living can. but the ninjas are everywhere. they hurl shuriken at him by the handful, a storm of jagged steel racing for raizo's flesh. raizo blocks some of the shuriken, misses many more. the shuriken strike muscles, tendons, flesh. he swings around, still trying to attack, there are too many of them. he stumbles back towards the edge of the roof as takeshi swings what he believes will be the death blow as raizo half falls, half leaps backward, falling from the rooftop, tumbling through space, until he splashes into the canal below bubbles dancing between the ribbons of blood.}
