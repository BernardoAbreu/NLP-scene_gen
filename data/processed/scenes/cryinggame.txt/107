<D>__{yes. say hello to col }
<A>__{he leads her out the door. fergus goes back into the room, past jude's body. looks out the window to where he can see dil staggering down the street, through the crowds that have gathered. the wail of police sirens coming closer. he watches dil run off, with her funny walk. then looks down and sees the cop cars pushing through the knot of people around the house. he picks up the gun, wipes it with a rag to remove dil's fingerprints. he turns to the picture of the soldier; talks to it.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{you should have stayed at home.}
<A>__{he sits in the chair by the window, waiting.}
