<L>__{interior stark's hotel suite, night}
<A>__{close shot of willie, seated, with his feet propped up on a table. pillsbury stands before him. jack, sadie, duffy, and sugar boy are also in the room.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{look at you, pillsbury. fifty years old, gut sprung, teeth gone, never had a dime. if the almighty had intended for you to be rich he'd have taken care of that a long time ago. the idea of you being rich... that's plain blasphemy. ain't that a fact?}
<A>__{pillsbury doesn't answer.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{answer me!}
<C>__{pillsbury}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{louder, man. don't mumble. speak up. say it's a fact, a blasphemous fact.}
<C>__{pillsbury}
<D>__{it's a fact, a blasphemous fact.}
<A>__{sugar boy laughs loudly. the phone rings and sadie picks it up.}
<C>__{sadie}
<D>__{yeah?... oh, i see.}
<P>__{(hangs up)}
<D>__{dumond can't come. he says his wife is sick.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i don't care if she's dying. sugar, get the car. get him and bring him over here.}
<A>__{sugar boy exists. willie turns back to pillsbury.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{now, you know what you're supposed to do, don't you, pillsbury? you're supposed to stay poor and take orders. oh, there'll be some sweetening for you from time to time... but duffy'll take care of that. don't you go setting yourself up on your own again, do you understand that?}
<C>__{pillsbury}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{louder, man. and say, i understand that.}
<C>__{pillsbury}
<D>__{i understand that.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{give him a pen and some paper, sadie.}
<A>__{there is a knock on the door.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{see who that is, duffy.}
<A>__{judge stanton enters.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{oh, hello, judge. sit down. i will be with you in just a couple of seconds.}
<P>__{(back to pillsbury)}
<D>__{now write what i tell you to write... dear governor stark. i wish to resign as auditor due to ill health, to take effect as soon as you can relieve me. respectfully yours.}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{did you sign it?}
<C>__{pillsbury}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(roaring)}
<D>__{well, sign it! don't put any date on it. i can fill that in when i need it.}
<A>__{pillsbury signs the paper.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{now bring it to me.}
<A>__{pillsbury moves slowly, so sadie yanks the paper out of his hand and passes it to willie.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{now get out.}
<A>__{pillsbury slinks out of the room.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{the papers have the story.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{yeah, i know.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{they're talking about impeachment proceedings.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{against who?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{this time, pillsbury.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i got that "this time," judge.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{how true is it?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{it's too true.}
<A>__{the phone rings.}
<C>__{sadie}
<D>__{yes?}
<P>__{(hands phone to willie)}
<D>__{this is it, willie. jeff hopkins on the wire.}
<A>__{willie takes the phone, but puts his hand over the mouthpiece so that he can speak to jack.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what have we got on hopkins, jack?}
<P>__{(as jack riffles}
<D>__{through the black}
<P>__{book)}
<D>__{hello, jeff. about that pillsbury business...}
<P>__{(reads from black}
<D>__{book jack holds out}
<P>__{for him)}
<D>__{here's what i want you to do when it comes up in the legislature. now, wait a minute, wait a minute. you listen to me.}
<P>__{(still reading from book)}
<D>__{you got a mortgage coming due on that place of yours in about five weeks, haven't you? you'd like to get it renewed, wouldn't you?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{all right, tiny'll talk to you in the morning.}
<A>__{he grins and hangs up the phone.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{get going, tiny.}
<A>__{duffy leaves.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{you haven't answered my question. why are you saving pillsbury's hide?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i'm not a bit interested in pillsbury's hide. it's something much more important than that. if the mcmurphy boys get the notion they can get away with this, there's no telling where they'll stop.}
<C>__{judge}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{or where you will... pillsbury is guilty. as attorney general of this state, it's my job to prosecute.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{judge, you talk like pillsbury was... was human. he isn't. he's a thing. you don't prosecute an adding machine if the spring goes busted and makes a mistake. you fix it. well, i fixed him. i'm not a bit interested in pillsbury. it's something much bigger than that.}
<C>__{judge}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{yes, it is.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he's right, judge. can't you see that he's right?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{he's right because you want him to be right. because you're afraid to admit you've made a mistake. do it now before it's too late.}
<P>__{(to willie)}
<D>__{i'm offering my resignation as attorney general. you'll have it in writing by messenger in the morning... dated.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{it took you a long time to make up your mind, judge. a long time. what made you take such a long time?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i wasn't sure.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{and now you are?}
<A>__{the judge nods.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i will tell you what you are. you're scared. you sat in that big easy chair of yours for thirty years and played at being a judge. then all of a sudden i came along and put a bat in your hand, and i said, go ahead, judge, start swinging. and you did. and you had a wonderful time. but now you're scared. you don't want to get your hands dirty. you want to pick up the marbles... but you don't want to get your hands dirty. look at my whole program, judge. how do you think i put that across?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i knew how, but i never knew why.}
<A>__{he starts to leave.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{you're not by any chance thinking of going over to mcmurphy's boys, are you?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i'm through with politics.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i'm happy to hear that.}
<P>__{(extends his hand)}
<D>__{no hard feelings.}
<C>__{judge}
<P>__{(ignores the hand)}
<D>__{goodbye, governor.}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{are you coming with me, jack?}
<A>__{jack turns away.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{you're making a mistake.}
<A>__{he goes. willie closes the door behind him.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{do you think he means it when he says he's through with politics, sadie?}
<C>__{sadie}
<D>__{no. no, i don't.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what about you, jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i've known the judge all my life. he's always meant everything he's said.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{all right. all right. take it easy. i will take your word for it.}
