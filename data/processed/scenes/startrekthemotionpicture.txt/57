<D>__{captain's log, stardate 7412.6. 2.7 hours from launch...}
<L>__{interior bridge favoring the viewer}
<A>__{all hands tense with the excitement of the journey, on the viewer saturn and its rings are falling away (behind us). over this:}
<C>__{kirk }
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{... in order to intercept the intruder at the earliest possible time, we must now risk engaging warp drive while still within the solar system...}
<A>__{end of log. angle on decker science station punching in equations on his console, reaching a reading:}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{captain, assuming we have full warp capability, accelerating to warp seven on leaving solar system will bring us to ip with the intruder in twenty point one hours.}
<B>__{include ilia}
<A>__{checking her console.}
<C>__{ilia}
<D>__{science officer's computations confirmed, sir.}
<A>__{and decker and ilia glance at each other and again, you know there is something more than casual in this.}
<B>__{angle on the elevator doors}
<A>__{as they open, and mccoy appears, walks over to kirk who swings his chair around to face him. mccoy is his usual dour self.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{well, bones, do the new medical facilities meet with your approval? mccoy they do not. it's like working in a damned computer center.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(turning to decker)}
<D>__{programming ready?}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{program set for standard warp entry, captain...}
<A>__{kirk starts to swing his chair to normal position decker calls:}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{... but i still recommend further simulation study.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{mister decker; every minute brings that object nearer earth!}
<P>__{(using intercom)}
<D>__{engineering! stand by for warp drive.}
<A>__{mccoy is watching kirk, a bit surprised at his abrupt ness to decker.}
<C>__{scott's intercom voice}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{captain, we need further warp simulation on the flow sensors...}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{engineer, we need warp speed now! mccoy}
<P>__{(very gently)}
<D>__{you're pushing jim. your people know their jobs.}
<A>__{kirk flashes mccoy a glance of annoyance then back to using intercom:}
