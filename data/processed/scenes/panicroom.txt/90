<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{bam! in the master bedroom, a claw hammer crunches into the sheetrock on the outer wall of the panic room. the intruders are in the master bedroom now, and burnham is like a man possessed, tearing at the sheetrock with the sharp end of the tool while junior shines a flashlight into the hole. as the sheetrock tears away, we see the skeleton of the wall behind it. there's a latticework of two by four studs, and beyond those the dull shine of the wall's metal core. but that's not what he's after. he continues tearing, reveals an air duct running through the wall, feeding into the panic room through a welded hole in the steel. burnham tears away with the hammer, exposing a short section of the duct. clang! the claw hammer drops into an opened toolbox. burnham drops to his knees, rips open another tool case. this one has a sophisticated looking power drill in it, along with a couple dozen specialized bits. he selects one, twists it into the drill. at the wall, burnham puts drill to metal and hits the switch. a horrendous metal screech fills the air and the drill bit tears into the duct, opening up a jagged hole about the size of a quarter. raoul hurries through the doorway of the bedroom, carrying a coiled garden hose. burnham snaps his fingers for it, raoul tosses it to him, holding one end, and the hose uncoils in the air as it snakes across the room. burnham shoves the end of the garden hose into the hole he's just drilled in the air duct. rip! he tears off a length of duct tape and seals the connection, makes it airtight. slit! using a large hunting knife, raoul hacks a ten foot section of the garden hose off the coil. he stretches it out, across the room, to the white five gallon tank we saw before, which is now sitting on the floor up here. we move in close as burnham snugs the cut end of the garden hose over a spigot at the top of the tank. red block letters are easy to read on the side of the tank.}

<A>__{caution flammable along with a number of other dire warnings. burnham raises his hand to the knob, hesitates, doesn't really want to do this, but doesn't stop himself either. he spins it open. halfway.}

<D>__{just sending a message. she'll get the pointerior}
<A>__{gas hisses through the spigot and into the hose. we follow along the length of the hose, across the floor of the room, through the hole in the sheetrock, into the hole that's been drilled in the air duct }
<B>__{inside the wall}
<A>__{ through the wall itself, where we see the horizontal lines of an air vent up ahead. we squeeze between two of the horizontal lines }
