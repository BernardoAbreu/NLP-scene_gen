<A>__{we hear a harpsichord begin playing as a wider angle reveals a huge, magnificent room with vaulted ceilings thirty feet high. floor to ceiling windows. hanging tapestries. victor sits at the harpsichord, a very serious 7 year old in his little gentleman's suit and stiff starched collar. mrs. moritz, head of the housekeeping staff, conducts the lesson. her daughter justine, age 4, sits with her doll in a huge wingback chair, making it dance to the music as she listens... but her eyes are on victor. she adores him. an enormous door swings open. victor stops playing. his parents enter, ushering a somber and beautiful elizabeth, age 6, across the vast expanse of floor. victor slides off the bench and faces them.}
