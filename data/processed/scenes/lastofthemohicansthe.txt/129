<D>__{this is it, as far as we can go ... if we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. if we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.}

<A>__{reverse: wide hawkeye helps cora; heyward, the ranger. chingachgook carries alice, down the rockface into a cave. we hear a distant roar reverberating off the walls. another angle: the walls are scooped out, bone like hollows eroded by tumbling water. at an earlier time the formation was part of the falls. hawkeye & cora reach the irregular floor of the chamber. the roar is louder.}

<A>__{followed by uncas, takes stock of their supplies. they check their powder. they have almost none. uncas shares his with hawkeye. the redcoat's cartridge case is soaked, the paper cartridges a soggy mess. heyward has none. the ranger has two left. in mohican, chingachgook decides some things. hawkeye and uncas nod. heyward approaches hawkeye.}
