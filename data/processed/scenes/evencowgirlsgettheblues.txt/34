<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{walking down the long dirt road, sissy stops to take a breather and sits down on a log. sissy thinking and looking into the clouds. waves of grasses whisper her name: ssssssssss, sssssssssssss sisssy. meadowlarks squander their songs on her as she begins to squirm on the log. a lincoln continental drives up suddenly. sissy barely has time to zip up. the cadillac stops in front of sissy. a teenaged girl in a stetson is at the wheel. the rear door of the limousine opens and a refined matronly voice calls from the void.}
<C>__{miss adrian}
<D>__{by any chance are you sissy hankshaw?}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{yes i am.}
<A>__{a chic middle aged woman leans out of the car.}
<C>__{miss adrian}
<D>__{my goodness. why didn't you telephone? someone would have driven into mottburg to pick you up. i'm miss adrian. from the ranch. the countess wrote that i should expect you. get in, won't you? you must be exhausted. gloria, assist miss hankshaw with her luggage.}
<A>__{gloria nods at sissy amicably but doesn't make a move to help her. sissy swings her sack into the roomy vehicle. before she gets in she flashes her thumb to hitch a ride. the instant that sissy shuts the door the cowgirl chauffeur floors the cadillac and it lurches away in a puff of dust.}
