<A>__{jennifer check lies on her bed, fidgeting as she watches tv. she's a girl of 16 with long, matted hair and a thin, frail body. her features are gorgeous, but she looks sick and haggard. she picks at her skin with yellowed, nosferatu like fingernails and chews idly on a limp lock of hair. jennifer wears a tight t shirt that says kettle high flags and underwear. an `80s horror movie flickers on the tv. jennifer half watches, distracted.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{jennifer didn't always look this rough. actually, she was the prettiest girl in devil's kettle when she wasn't so...hungry.}
<A>__{some recent photos on a corkboard reveal that jennifer was indeed beautiful and curvy.}
<C>__{needy v.o. }
<D>__{she hadn't fed in weeks.}
<A>__{jennifer rolls over and glances at the window briefly. we see the outside of the house again. it's dark and silent, but for the nearly inaudible snapping of twigs. jennifer turns her attention back to the tv. suddenly, we see needy's face pop up against the window, white and startling. before jennifer notices, the face disappears. outside the house, the bushes rustle. needy is crouched below the window. we hear the pulsing of her heart as if via ultrasound. it's a wet, rhythmic sound: sploish, sploish, sploish. inside, jennifer stretches and shuts off the tv. she turns out the light. a beat of silence. then, the sound of cracking near the window.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{needy plunges through the window, screaming and brandishing a hammer. she takes a swing at jennifer's head, but misses and buries it in the wall, specifically in jennifer's fall out boy poster. needy throws herself on top of jennifer. she straddles jennifer and grips her throat, throttling her.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{you'll throw me a bone, huh? huh? you killed chip! you goddamned monster! you...zombitch!}
<A>__{jennifer struggles to fight off needy in the darkness. her clawlike fingernails rake needy's back and arms. needy pulls a box cutter out of her waistband and flicks it open like a switchblade. kshink!}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(gagging)}
<D>__{do you buy all your murder weapons at home depot? god, you're butch.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{know what this is for? cutting boxes.}
<A>__{she takes a swipe at jennifer's crotch. jennifer instinctively clutches herself and rears up in defense. we see jennifer's mouth come down on needy's neck. needy shrieks as if bitten, but continues to strangle jennifer, straddling her and bearing down. jennifer's t shirt slides up to her armpits, exposing her breasts. for a moment, her eyes meet needy's and she grins. it's as if she has control over needy for a split second, sexual control... needy recoils and slashes jennifer's body left and right with the box cutter, marking a gory, oozing "x" on her torso.}
<C>__{needy }
<P>__{(hysterical)}
<D>__{cross out jennifer!}
<A>__{jennifer gasps, staring at her wounds in shock and disbelief. she looks back up at needy. a beat of silence. suddenly, the girls' bodies levitate rapidly toward the ceiling. they wrestle in a bloody, screaming airborne heap, their figures entwined. their bodies fall, collapsing back onto the bed with a thud. needy raises the box cutter and plunges it into jennifer's heart. blood geysers from the wound.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(choking)}
<D>__{my tit!}
<A>__{suddenly, the room is flooded with bright light, revealing a needy straddling jennifer's mutliated body. jennifer's breathing is a raspy death rattle. mrs. check, a middle aged woman in bad sleepwear and a worse perm rushes into the bedroom.}
<C>__{mrs. check}
<D>__{jennifer! what is it, baby? oh my god! oh my god!}
<A>__{she pulls needy off her daughter. jennifer rolls over, gasping and bleeding.}
<C>__{mrs. check }
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{needy?}
<A>__{needy drops the boxcutter. it lands on jennifer's copy of flag team quarterly, splashing the model with fresh gore.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{is she dead, mrs. check? did i get her?}
<A>__{mrs. check cradles her maimed daughter on the floor like a white trash pieta. jennifer takes one last breath, vomits blood, and dies. mrs. check screams. needy smiles.}
