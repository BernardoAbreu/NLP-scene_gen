<L>__{exterior paradise falls gas 'n' grub roof same}
<A>__{the ice cream truck pulls to a stop with its headlights facing the diner. everyone aims their guns at the truck. tense. from the ice cream truck...a dark bloody shoe steps to the ground. moving up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains to reveal a skeletally thin man in tattered coveralls. say hello to the ice cream man. he looks like he's been through hell literally. as he steps into the beams of the headlights we can see him even more clearly. he's tall. too tall. his clothes don't seem to fit him. and he's unnaturally thin as if he's been stretched like taffy. if he got down on all fours, you might mistake him for some kind of spider. he surveys the diner, the garage, the roof assessing the situation. on the roof, the men wait for something to happen.}
<C>__{kyle}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{ah, he don't look that bad.}
<A>__{the ice cream man's gaze snaps up to the roof. he heard.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{oh, shit. oh, shit. oh, shit.}
<A>__{that's when the ice cream man's jaw unhinges, stretching torturously down to nearly the middle of his chest! row after row of a razor sharp teeth form with the sickening sound of cracking of bones. from his new mouth, the ice cream man lets out an earth shattering howl. everyone except michael is practically hyperventilating with fear.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{get ready!}
<A>__{and the ice cream man bolts for the diner with startling speed! his movements aren't at all like those of a normal man, but rather like some kind of human insect. michael aims. blam! blam! blam! bullets rip into the creature's body, knocking him flat on his back. still. arms and legs in a twisted, twitching mess. michael keeps his aim. waits. the calliope music continues to play.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{is that it?}
<A>__{not even close. a rumbling of engines. headlights. a freeway full of vehicles of every variety punch through the wall of dust, racing toward the diner. they are the}
<B>__{commuters.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{now! shoot now!}
<A>__{the men let loose with ferocious firepower. windshields shatter! tires blow out! engines explode! vehicles swerve and collide! dark shapes bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering. in the flash of battle we catch glimpses of them: business}
<B>__{people. construction workers. even an entire high school}
<A>__{football team. all deformed by some demonic force. many mere balls of flame drifting through the darkness.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{spread out! don't let them get close to the windows!}
<A>__{the dark shapes converge on the diner from all directions. they move so strangely fast it seems that their feet don't actually touch the ground. from the roof it's a full on turkey shoot as the men follow michael's instructions and cut down everything in sight. their faces lighting up with each flash. shell casings spray from their weapons like water drops from a sprinkler. bodies burst and crumble to the dirt. the creatures don't seem to be afraid of dying. their strategy appears to be in their sheer numbers. with each wave, the dark figures get ever closer to the diner. on bob firing madly. then... click! click! oh, no. he's out of ammo.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{shells!}
<A>__{percy tosses him a box of shells. but bob fumbles the catch and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{fuck!}
<A>__{with the gun still in one hand, bob reaches frantically down for the ammo. stretching... further... a hideously wounded middle aged housewife catapults up from below the roofline! her hair must have been in curlers before most of it burned away. her nightdress hangs in tatters off her body. her jaw clicks rapidly, as she clatters up at bob like a giant insect. bob tries to pull back, but he has no traction and he starts to slip down toward her. she's coming fast! percy sees his friend in trouble.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{bob!}
<A>__{bob swings the shotgun like a club crack! knocking the bitch clear off the roof. but the move has made his slide even faster. he drops the shotgun, trying to hold on, but he can't stop!}
<B>__{bob is about to hit the edge when the horrid woman pops up}
<A>__{right in front of him! she doesn't even have a chance to react as bob does something akin to a swimmer's push right off her body! wham! the creature goes flying back off the roof and the opposing force halts bob's slide.}
<C>__{percy}
<P>__{(extending his hook)}
<D>__{grab my hand!}
<A>__{bob reaches up and clasps percy's hook, praying that it stays on. but this chick ain't finished yet. up she comes once more. her razor sharp fingernails claw up the metal roof. screech!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{gun!}
<A>__{percy tosses bob a glock. fortunately this time bob deftly catches it with his free hand just as the deranged woman pounces on him.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(jamming the gun in her mouth)}
<D>__{fuck off!}
<A>__{blam! blam! blam! the back of her head explodes. her body goes limp. bob struggles to push the corpse off of him.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{pull me up!}
<A>__{percy extends his hook hand, helping bob ascend to safety.}
