<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i've cheated on you and it kills me and the guilt of what i've done...i don't want you to think...maybe you knew, i think that maybe you've known... so i hope that i'm not saying this for me...for me to make myself feel better about what i've done...but for making you not feel like you're sitting there like a jerk...you've been the good one... you understand...i'm so sorry for all i've done wrong...and this is pathetic...what? "dying man, confess the sins" something? is it selfish for me to say this? to say what i've done...i feel better already. i do...do you hate me?}
