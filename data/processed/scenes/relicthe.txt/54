<A>__{on margo... lying on the carpet. there's a large, nasty bump on her forehead. the totem pole is on the floor beside her. leaning over her is pendergast. margo starts to sit up. pendergast gently restrains her.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{i heard you calling and i ran after you, but you kept disappearing and i couldn't keep up.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(she touches her forehead)}
<D>__{you were behind me? running after me?}
<A>__{pendergast nods. as margo rises he tries to help her but she waves him off, collecting her thoughts.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it's okay, i'm all right. i remember now... it was an animal. something large! i could smell it. it was hunting me. i saw two green eyes in the dark.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{where did you see it?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{behind me. over there.}
<A>__{margo turns and points behind her to... a large northwest coast indian mask. it's carved out of wood in a horrible grimace, inset with two glowing green eyes. pendergast sees it too, says nothing.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{that's not what i saw.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{all right. if you're positive.}
<A>__{she leans against the wall, touches her forehead, panic overcoming her again.}
<C>__{margo }
<D>__{i can't think straight at the moment. i know how crazy this seems. please, mr. pendergast, i need some fresh air. could you get me out of here?}
