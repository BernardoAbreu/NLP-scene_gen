<A>__{the pounding continues as we see rita standing in the doorway, watching her sleeping child. this stranger that she's raised. she moves to cover him, this tough little boy, when she sees pooh bear tucked under his arm. she tucks them both in, tenderly.}

<B>__{back to sam}
<A>__{from where he stands, all he sees is lucy getting everything she deserves. he looks down at the tiny bouquet in his hand feeling profoundly inadequate, he reaches for some flowers from a garden he's passing. puts them in his bouquet. then stops. feels guilty. tries to put the flowers back. he stares up at lucy on the porch a few houses away. lucy sits on the steps. randy sits right next to her.}
<B>__{back on sam}
<A>__{where he was standing, but is now gone. the flowers lay in the dirt. from the porch, lucy looks out and waits. and waits. and waits.}
