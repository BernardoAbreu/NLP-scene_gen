<L>__{interior living room the next morning}
<A>__{a very wide middle aged nurse gruffly crosses thru the room toward the front door. just as she opens the door, erica enters in hat, sunglasses, turtleneck, long skirt. pretty much no skin is showing whatsoever. she carries a few packages.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{good bye mrs. barry.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{good bye? you're leaving? that's not good.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{been fired.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{fired? you just started.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{not fired darlin'. just not needed.}
<A>__{erica hardly looks at you know who who appears to be fresh out of the shower, wet hair, silk robe, bare chest and legs.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{what do you mean, not needed? of course we need her. she's gonna take care of you and feed you and...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ no, no, i'm actually feeling pretty perky today. making quite a recovery. . .}
<P>__{(opening the screen door)}
<D>__{sorry for the trouble mrs. gimble... take care, dear.}
<A>__{harry hands her a wad of bills like she's a maitre'd. mrs. gimble gives erica a look of pity as she exits. erica, now alone with harry, self consciously adjusts her sunglasses. harry, on the other hand, slips his hand onto his bare chest, pats it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{listen, about last night.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah. how 'bout we never talk about that?}
<P>__{(hands him some pills)}
<D>__{i was at the drugstore. your prescriptions were ready. they said take these two with food and this one without.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{honestly, you were in silhouette.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i think that's talkin' about it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i really didn't see all that much.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(heading toward her room)}
<D>__{yip. there you go.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{okay. won't mention it again but...}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(almost out of the room)}
<D>__{goin' to work, harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{you saw my ass, you don't see me acting nuts, wearing hats and glasses and weird get ups...}
<A>__{the sound of a door slam. harry flinches.}
