<B>__{underground cells}
<A>__{mr. pick leans against a door, trying to keep back the howling horde of prisoners pushing from the other side. another jailer joins him, helping him to try and push the door closed. then a second jailer too. a bestial hand reaches through and mr. pick presses his pistol muzzle into the outstretched palm bang! a book falls to the floor like a pistol shot and kafka hides back in shadows hoping no one heard. he's in a round }
<B>__{library}
<A>__{ surrounded by books from floor to ceiling, even on the tall door through which he entered. a sliver of light gives it away and on the other side of it he hears footsteps. but they pass by. there's another sliver of light indicating another door in the books opposite him. he walks over and pulls on the shelves. here the dark wood is merely a disguising cover for the shiny modern steel he discovers on the other side of it and he finds more than that as he enters }
<B>__{the laboratory}
<A>__{a real mad scientist's workshop. chemicals of bizarre colors rush and fizz through mazes of glass pipes and beakers, in some places boiling and steaming, in others frosting or freezing. circuits and test tubes flash and glow as sparks and filamentary arcs crackle with electric incandescence. insane instruments and devices, interconnected with complex wires, perform strange and villainous functions. it's the most modern setting we've yet seen but at the same time all this futuristic technology seems somehow archaic, as if put together from old, familiar materials and elements, both eccentric and eclectic. the chain that runs through the floors of the castle carrying documents runs up and down through the laboratory too. amidst this feast for the eyes, what kafka now focuses in on a simple cigarette left smoking in an ashtray. and by the look of the ash, not very long ago. kafka looks around anxiously notices an archway leading to another room.}
