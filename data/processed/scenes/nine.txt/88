<A>__{the clapper board. title: il vicolo (the alley) her name: luisa acari. a small set. a couple of tables and chairs, as if it's an outdoor cafe in piazza navona. luisa enters, younger, she's like audrey hepburn... luisa sits on the chair.}

<D>__{and, of course, i studied theatre and mime in paris. but, mostly waited tables.}
<A>__{guido enters. he's fascinated by her. she's taken aback that he's in front of the camera and approaching her. he walks straight up to her and unties her hair. it's oddly intimate. he stands back to reappraise her.}
