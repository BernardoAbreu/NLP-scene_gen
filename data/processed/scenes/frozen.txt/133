<A>__{the pack of cigarettes falls into the snow.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{ahhhh!}
<T>__{hard cut to:}
<L>__{exterior chair lift late afternoon}
<A>__{the two are bundled together as the evening winds start to pick up. again, they speak without emotion. it's conversation just to let themselves know that they are still alive.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{how come you never have a girlfriend?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{how am i supposed to answer that?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i mean, you're a decent guy. girls dig you. but you never stay in a relationship.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i had a serious girlfriend once.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{high school doesn't count.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{no, post high school. freshmen year.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{this girl annie. i met her at orientation. we emailed all summer and when we started school, it was like we were already going out. i totally just felt it with her, you know? we were into a lot of the same stuff, which was cool. she was way into aerosmith. i had seen them fifteen times, she had seen them twenty. how cool is that?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{she um... same favorite movie as me. e.t. it was like soul mates and that stuff you read about.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{so then... what happened?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{same old shit.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{no. you know what happened? she liked another guy. this fucking fraternity douchebag named dean who kept sending her flowers and stuff. i don't know who it was exactly, but every time i'd go to her room some guy named "dean" had left her notes and shit.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{why did she keep it? was she trying to make you jealous?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i don't know. i think she just liked getting attention.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{so she dumped you for a frat guy?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{no. i dumped her. we were in the cafeteria, right? and i was sitting facing her, facing the wall...and she was facing everyone in the cafeteria behind me. and i kept seeing her smiling at someone behind me and like, almost laughing. so i was like, "who are you laughing at?" you know? like "what the hell is going on?" and she's like, "dean's making fun of you."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so i turn around, and i'm like ready to kick the shit out of this guy. and all i see is a sea of fucking random people. just all of these faces. this guy could see me and was making eyes with my girlfriend...but i couldn't see him.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{that's messed up.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i've never felt so stupid and bad in my life.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{so i left.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you just walked out?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{yup. told her to go laugh with "dean the frat guy". i was out.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{that sucks.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{maybe... maybe i shouldn't have been so quick to walk out. maybe i needed to have a thicker skin and not be such a sensitive bitch, i don't know. sometimes i think i was just insecure and maybe i screwed up.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you should call her. when you get home. you could tell her that.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i can't.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{she's dating dean.}
<A>__{emotion has fought it's way to the surface again. parker and lynch share a nervous laugh together. she turns away from him. after a few seconds, her laughs turn to tears.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i should have done something.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{there was nothing either of us could have done.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i sat here and let him die.}
<C>__{lynch}
<B>__{e}
<D>__{no, you didn't. we didn't let him die. there was nothing we could have done. he jumped down there to try and save us, ok?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{he was the one. he was the boy i was gonna marry.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{funny story. first grade, we all get left there for the day by our mom's. you know, alone in real school for the first time without our folks around. and dan... dan was this sort of chubby kid when he was little...}
<A>__{parker laughs.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{nah, fuck it. he was a fat ass.}
<A>__{parker laughs harder.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{and all the mom's left and he just wouldn't let go of his mom's hand. he just stood there after she left, at the front of the room, crying like a total pussy.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{sounds like dan.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{you have no idea. but then, the teacher... mrs... what was her name? mrs. schifrin? she was trying everything to get the fat kid to stop crying. and so she says, "well dan, is there anyone else in the class that you know?" you know, like, "maybe there's a friend you'd like to sit with?" and the fucker points right at me and says "him"! i had never seen this kid before in my life, you know? but for whatever reason, he points right at me.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{and so he had to sit with you?}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{for a week! for my whole first week of school i'm sharing my little cubby desk with his fat ass!}
<A>__{parker laughs through her tears.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{douchebag. i never let him forget it.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i loved him so much.}
<A>__{lynch is determined.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{but if he died only for you and me to give up and die up here, that's bullshit.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{so i need you to pull it together, and we're gonna get out of this shit. we're gonna get out of this for dan. alright?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{lynch bites his severely chapped lips.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{help me up.}
