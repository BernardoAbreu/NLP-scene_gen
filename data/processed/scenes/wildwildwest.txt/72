<L>__{exterior loveless mansion courtyard night (same time)}
<A>__{west is lifted onto the back of a wagon. with the noose dangling in front of his nose, west addresses the crowd.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{can i have everyone's attention please. i think we've had a series of major misunderstandings and i'd like to take a moment to clear them up. first, the whole drumming on the boobies thing. in my native land, africa, my ancestors used drums to communicate between villages. i'm sure y'all can see that this young girl here can communicate all the way down to baton rouge. hell, on a clear day, we might even get galveston. all i was saying was, 'how're you doing,' 'my name's jim,' 'how's your mama?'}
<C>__{west }
<D>__{second misunderstanding. that redneck comment. i'm getting the sense that some of you took that negatively. you know, some of my best friends are whiskey guzzling, pot bellied rednecks just like y'all here.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{that slavery thing, i don't see what the big deal was. hell, who wouldn't want somebody to run around for them doing chores. are you going to get your big, fat, lazy ass out of bed every morning and pick your own damn cotton. i don't think so.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{let's head on inside and knock back some shine. come on, back inside. no. okay.}
<P>__{(to soiled dove)}
<D>__{i stand before you as a man who realizes he has done something wrong and i am prepared to do the right thing. will you marry me?}
<A>__{soiled dove gasps.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i will take that as a no. darling, would it help at all if i said i thought you were a man?}
<A>__{the camera finds the soiled dove. she faints.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{guess not.}
<A>__{as west searches desperately for signs of rescue by his "partner," suddenly the wagon lurches forward...}
<C>__{george washington}
<D>__{hang him!}
<A>__{new angle west's feet as they plummet toward the ground. close west's neck the rope catches... and stretches! close west's feet as they slowly touch the ground. nobody is more confused than west.}
<B>__{angle on crowd}
<A>__{how the fuck did that happen? but before anybody can figure out gordon's trick rope, speak of the devil...}
<C>__{gordon }
<D>__{hey yaa!!!}
<A>__{the crowd turns with alarm to see...}
<B>__{angle on team of charging horses}
<A>__{nostrils flared and wild eyed, are having their rumps snapped by gordon's reins. rita holds on for dear life as the mad mountain man drives the carriage at full speed right into the crowd scattering them.}
<B>__{angle on west}
<A>__{he sees his opportunity for rescue, puts a foot into the back of george washington, grabs his gun, and somersaults into the air... angle on gordon and carriage west lands squarely in the back. and just as the rope starts to stretch around his neck again, gordon whirls around with a bowie knife and cuts it.}
