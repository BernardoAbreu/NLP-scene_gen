<CHAR>__{REVISED SECOND DRAFT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{December 8, 2002}
<ACTION>__{The Woodward Forensic Institute (WFI) is a 175-bed Intermediate Security treatment facility for male and female psychiatric patients. Its primary clientele are those who have histories of committing criminal offenses and are either committed to the Department of Mental Health by the Circuit Courts of the State or who are admitted under authority of an appointed guardian.}
<TRANS>__{FADE IN: OPENING CREDITS OVER QUICK CUTS:}
<LOC>__{INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM - DAWN}
<ACTION>__{PUSH in on a sleeping couple in the dark. The ALARM CLOCK reads 5:59 AM. The woman's eyes open a second before the alarm beeps and turns it off. She grabs a glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it. Climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs (wedding, vacation, etc.). This is MIRANDA GREY: 30, sharp and prettier than she knows.}
<LOC>__{INT. GYM SWIMMING POOL - MORNING}
<ACTION>__{Miranda slides through the water. Swimming cap on, goggles. Her STEADY BREATHING takes us in and out of the water. Something unsettling about this sound. Something slightly unsettling too about her detached manner. A person on autopilot, recognizing only the water and the perfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path. Like graphic metaphors for her own conscience: flat. She emerges from the pool and self-consciously wraps herself in a towel.}
<LOC>__{INT. COFFEEHOUSE - MORNING}
<ACTION>__{Miranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper.}
<LOC>__{INT. KITCHEN - MORNING}
<ACTION>__{Miranda's husband DOUGLAS GREY (older, a superficial analysis would suggest a father figure) serves breakfast. Miranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case file. He sips from his takeout coffee and reads the newspaper. A pleasant domestic scene. It's 8:00 AM.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ST. ANNE'S HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING}
<ACTION>__{Miranda's Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps. Doug kisses his wife and hops out. Exemplary carpoolers. Students are already chatting him up as Miranda drives off.}
<LOC>__{EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ON A SURVEILLANCE MONITOR}
<ACTION>__{Miranda's car at some sort of guard gate. A BUZZER lets her in. As the car drives past we read the plate on the wall: "WOODWARD FORENSIC INSTITUTE" The gate shuts behind her with a certain finality as we...}
<LOC>__{INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - MIRANDA'S OFFICE - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{Stark walls. Simple decor. Bookshelves packed with the according psychiatric tomes and diplomas. Miranda faces a troubled young mess of a woman, CHLOE: charismatic, deranged and forever trying to provoke. Mid-session:}

<DIAL>__{My stepfather?  No.   He's dead.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat)}
<DIAL>__{I killed him.}

<DIAL>__{That's the first time you admit it.}

<DIAL>__{The Devil.}
<CHAR>__{MIRANDA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Alright, the Devil. Why would the Devil visit you? It's already hell in here, what would he have to gain?}
<CHAR>__{CHLOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He came to fuck an angel.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(giggles at that)}
<DIAL>__{I'm his dirty angel.}
<ACTION>__{Before Miranda can analyze that one, the room LIGHTS FLICKER AND DIE. Darkness. Miranda's breathing speeds up.}
<CHAR>__{CHLOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He grabbed me by the hair while I sucked him and usually I love that, I just do -- maybe you can tell me why I love it so much -- but not this time, he was just too rough --}

<DIAL>__{That's it until Monday. Try and get some sleep tonight, okay?}
<CHAR>__{CHLOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure, Doctor.}

<CHAR>__{CHLOE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You don't have to say it.}
<ACTION>__{She almost doesn't seem crazy when she says this. Almost. TWO ORDERLIES appear at the door. Miranda nods for them to escort Chloe. Chloe shakes their hands away from her, strides off dramatically. The princess of the asylum.}
<LOC>__{INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER}

<DIAL>__{If you say so.}
<CHAR>__{SHERIFF RYAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<ACTION_ALT>__{BACK TO SCENE}
<ACTION>__{Miranda swerves to avoid her and slams into the railing. METAL SCREECHES as she struggles to regain control of the car and finally BRAKES TO A HALT -- She looks in her rearview mirror: the girl is standing back there. Drunk or high or in any case completely out of it.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat)}

<CHAR>__{MIRANDA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't be scared. It's going to be fine.}
<ACTION>__{Now the girl is touching Miranda's face. Her movements desperate, smothering. Like the movements of a drowning person. Miranda tries to push the girl's hands back down.}
<CHAR>__{MIRANDA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hands off me, okay? Tell me your name, do you remember your name?}
<ACTION>__{The girl tries to speak but no words come out. Instead she produces a strained, wettish sound. Creepy as hell. And now she is prying Miranda's mouth open and she's much stronger than expected and Miranda is panicking --}
<CHAR>__{MIRANDA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What are you doing? I'm trying to help you --?!}

<LOC>__{INT. BEDROOM - DAWN}
<ACTION>__{Miranda wakes up in a cold sweat.         Just a bad dream.    A beat. FAINT at first but GROWING LOUDER, we hear a REPETITIVE SOUND outside. Like an ECHO of some sort, but vaguely familiar: THWIP, THWIP, THWIP. Miranda takes a deep breath, reaches for the glass of water on her bedside table. Except... it's not there. She turns to her husband but he's not in the bed. And now she glances around the room and realizes this is not her bedroom. She climbs off the bed and walks in the dark. Trips over something. A TRAY that CLANGS LOUDLY. Her heartbeat goes haywire. She feels her way along the wall to a small opening in the door. A glass pane. She peers through the glass at the empty corridor outside, realizing what this must mean, realizing she's inside a cell. She jiggles the handle and pounds on the door, frantic --}

With a last fruitless look, she heads towards the front door when a glint of mental in the opposite corner stops her. She moves to it. And here, where the walls should meet, there is a narrow gap, leading to a passage, maybe five inches wide. A padlocked chain has been threaded through a hole in both walls, holding them together. Miranda inspects the heavy padlock, the source of the glint. She tugs on the wall and opens it to the limits of the chain, but that's only a few inches more. Miranda peers into the darkness beyond, but can't see a thing. Hesitating only a moment, she turns sideways and slides herself into the claustrophobic slot.

<DIAL>__{Dear Pete. Hope this finds you on both feet, preferably having been promoted to director after Phil's retirement. Not that you had much competition, but a big hug to you anyway... I was as surprised as anyone to read about Sheriff Ryan's suicide and the startling discovery that it was he who murdered my late husband. I wish I could personally thank certain people for their convincing testimonies in the case.}

<DIAL>__{P.S. And in case you're wondering what the chances are of me buying you a beer and maybe finishing something we almost started, the answer is: it's just not going to happen. Especially not at McSorley's next Friday night. Say around nine. So you probably shouldn't bother showing up. All my love, M.G.}
