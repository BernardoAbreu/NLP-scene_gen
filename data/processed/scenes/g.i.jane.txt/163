<A>__{start on the helmet graveyard. hands enter frame to reclaim one helmet in particular. tilt up on jordan, back in the grinder, back in navy greens. the spec recon class is here. crewmates gawk like stone idiots as jordan takes her old place in the line up.}
<C>__{c.o.}
<P>__{(to class)}
<D>__{one of you here understands better than anyone what this is all about. someone who has engaged in conduct unbecoming. someone who knows, i would hope, what he must now do.}
<A>__{close on wickwire. feeling the heat. wondering if they really know who it is. now the c.o. parks himself right in wickwire's face.}
<C>__{c.o.}
<D>__{and unless that someone takes the honorable way out in the next 10 seconds i will make certain he faces action under the uniform code of military justice.}
<A>__{wickwire breaks rank and heads for the bell. he slows when reaching jordan, considering an apology he knows would be inadequate.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{just walk away and never stop.}
<A>__{he does. as wickwire rings out:}
<C>__{c.o.}
<D>__{it seems we have an opening for class officer. any nominations?}
<A>__{eyes swing to jordan. way ahead of them:}
<C>__{c.o.}
<D>__{all those in favor?}
<A>__{a chorus of ayes. jordan puddles up.}
<C>__{c.o.}
<D>__{chief urgayle, turning it back over to you.}
<A>__{on his way to the front, the chief stops to check in with jordan.}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{well, i'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous or some new alloy of all three.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{good to see you again, too, sir.}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{okay, o'neil. so you've impressed all the others. now try me.}
