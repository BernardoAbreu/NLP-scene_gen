<D>__{will.}
<A>__{he stops. looks down at her hand.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{will suddenly realises what he's doing. absurd. pathetic. pitiful. slowly turns to face rachel. her eyes, looking up at him. his shoulders droop. exhausted. rachel reaches up. catches him in her arms. strong arms. caring. will buries his face in her neck. wants to be swallowed up. rachel holds him. arms encircling. will breathes her in. sweet, soft, safe. looks up. his mouth suddenly finding hers. a kiss, hungry, urgent. his arms move to surround her.}
