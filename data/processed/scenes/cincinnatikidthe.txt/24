<L>__{interior shooter's apartment}
<A>__{melba, the shooter's woman, is sitting up in bed working on her eyebrows and listening to music turned up loud on a radio. the bedside phone rings, barely audible above the radio. she answers it.}
<C>__{melba}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hello... yes, it is. you want him?}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{shooter! telephone! shooter!}
<A>__{she gets no answer, which is no wonder in view of the noise from the radio. but the radio is across the room and it's slightly easier for her to get out of the side of the bed she's on, and go to the door of the shooter's room. she opens this and we see the shooter in bed in his own small quarters, reading a magazine. he turns around inquiringly.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{phone for you. i always seem to be the one to answer it, no matter who it's for.}
<C>__{shooter}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{if you'd rather we put it in my room }
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{are you kidding?}
<A>__{the shooter picks up the phone but before he speaks into it, he pantomimes to her that he won't be able to hear over the radio. she seems to regard the request as an imposition but she does go grudgingly to the radio and turns it down a little before she returns to her bed and her cosmetic chore.}
<C>__{shooter}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hello?... well, hello. what brings you to our fair city? little action, maybe?}
