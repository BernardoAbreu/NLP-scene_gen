<A>__{ creep to a window: curtains pulled. creep to another: there she is. watch her: elegant fingers emanate from hands only now beginning to betray age. watch her shake her sandals off. arranging three coffee cups on a tray: company coming. on cue: another car. a `53 cadillac: the director and rock rockwell. i crane my neck to get as much of her as i can. she leaves the tray, cups steaming. muffled greetings. check the window, open. slide it up gentle.}
