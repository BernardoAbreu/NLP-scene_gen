<L>__{interior cell day night}
<A>__{the filing cabinets of the storeroom of knowledge dissolve squares of padding that form the walls of a cell. the laughter echoes round the cell. sam sees that mr helpmann, in his wheelchair is watching him. he is dressed as father christmas. they are alone in the cell. sam scrunches up into the corner.}
<C>__{helpmann}
<D>__{sam, what are we going to do with you? can you hear me, sam?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(in a hoarse urgent whisper)}
<D>__{where's jill? what have you done to her? where is she?!}
<C>__{helpmann}
<D>__{gillian layton?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes, you've got to get me out of here. i've got to find her.}
<C>__{helpmann}
<D>__{i understand, sam, i know exactly how you feel. so i brought you a bottle of barley water.}
<A>__{helpmann holds up a bottle of barley water.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{help me!}
<C>__{helpmann}
<D>__{i assure you, sam, i'm doing everything within my power. but the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them even me.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{this is all a mistake! don't you understand?!}
<C>__{helpmann}
<D>__{yes, well, from the department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm not a terrorist! you must know that! i'm not guilty! get me out of here!}
<C>__{helpmann}
<D>__{sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{please, i've got to find jill.}
<C>__{helpmann}
<D>__{sam, i think i ought to tell you ... i'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion. sam looks blank. thrown in the towel.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(takes a moment to work this out)}
<D>__{dead?}
<A>__{helpmann nods.}
<C>__{helpmann}
<D>__{yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{no, no ... i did that...}
<A>__{helpmann looks surprised. sam shuts up.}
<C>__{helpmann}
<D>__{the odd thing is it appears to have happened twice ... a bit of a disputed call, i'm afraid.}
<A>__{sam has gone catatonic.}
<C>__{helpmann}
<P>__{(starting to go)}
<D>__{so, there you are. all i can say is, don't fall at the last fence. the finishing post's in sight. see you in the paddock. good luck. keep your eye on the ball. got to go .... can't keep the orphans waiting.}
<A>__{helpmann goes. a guard helps him out and then returns with another to help put the restraining bag over sam.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{don't fight it, son .... confess quickly ... before they get into the expensive procedures. if you hold out too long you could jeopardise your credit rating.}
<A>__{the bag blacks everything out.}
