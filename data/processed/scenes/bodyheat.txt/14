<L>__{exterior the pier day}
<A>__{the thumping returns, as racine runs the long, straight pier directly out to sea, toward the rising sun. a lifeguard boat with an outboard motor is on the left of the pier. racine watches it as he runs until it disappears beneath him, then reappears on his right and turns out to sea, so that it is running beside him. racine speeds up, really kicking, racing the boat to the end of the pier. the lifeguard on board isn't even aware of racine, but he beats the runner nonetheless, then veers off to continue his business. racine pulls up, breathing hard. he walks it off a bit, watching the boat, then turns and starts walking back along the pier. he reaches into the waistband of his shorts and takes out a pack of cigarettes.}
