<L>__{interior stairwell morning}
<A>__{harvey, a man, seemingly impatient to start a `new life', runs up the steps. surprised at first by his agility, he begins to slow. he stops to catch his breath. suddenly his spare hand holds tight onto the bannister. unsteady harvey sits down. close up on harvey's face, confused. he tries to stand but again is forced back down. he begins to place his coffee on the stair next to him, but suddenly shudders, grabbing his shoulder. the coffee topples, spilling down the steps.}

<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{frightened and confused, harvey sits alone in the stairwell. just then, a door opens and the african porter from before, comes through, carrying a tray. he sees harvey.}

<D>__{sir, are you ok?}
