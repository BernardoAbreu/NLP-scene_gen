<L>__{interior kale's house kitchen day}
<A>__{a pair of hands wrap an electronic monitoring bracelet around kale's left ankle. wider to reveal the hands belong to kale's case officer, janet parker, 35, no nonsense. kale's perched on the center island. julie watches from the b.g. as parker clicks the bracelet's buckle into place, a green led light illuminates. it's on the top edge of the bracelet's band so kale can easily see it if he looks down. next to this light is an additional red light that isn't on.}

<D>__{a sixty foot radius from this guy here.}
<A>__{parker points to a big black box (the central tracking unit) on the kitchen counter.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{he's like a modem. he gets a constant signal from mr. bracelet that he sends through your phone line to the monitoring station downtown. so they know where you are, where you've been and what you're thinkin' 25 7.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{what if he accidentally goes beyond }
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(anticipating; re: red light on bracelet)}
<D>__{red light flashes. means you've got about ten seconds to get your butt back to green, or else }

<D>__{the execution squad shows up?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{and they don't bring blindfolds. it's also tamper proof and waterproof. so don't try sticking your foot in a bucket of water and hopping across the line. it won't work, and you'll look stupid. now, i will be checking up on you a lot. here's my card you're set up to pay his incarceration fee, ms. brecht?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{automatic withdrawal.}
<P>__{(to kale)}
<D>__{twelve bucks every day.}

<P>__{(re: a booklet)}
<D>__{everything else is in the manual.}
<P>__{(making her way out)}
<D>__{oh, except this house arrest might sound like a breeze, but trust me, i've seen all kinds of folks get a bit loopy before too long, some after just a day or two. so make sure you find lots of constructive things to keep yourself busy. d.j. caruso}
