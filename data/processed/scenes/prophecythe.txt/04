<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{dawn is a muddled, limp thing that does nothing to improve the alley. the figure is still there, a motionless gargoyle perched on the railing. watching the window. the shadows shorten, the air grows warmer, and now there's movement behind the window. the sunglassed gargoyle drops down off the railing, jumps up to the first rung of the fire escape, and begins climbing.}
<B>__{behind the third floor window}
<A>__{is a room as grim as we expect. lumpy iron bed, sink that's been pissed into one too many times, and simon; a man in a tight sweater and dark sunglasses, busily emptying his pockets on the ruined dresser: loose change, a town paper's obituary column. simon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body stifffening. he whips around to face the window just as it explodes into fragments. the gargoyle leaps into the room on the trail of glass. simon spins and throws himself against the intruder. the two struggle savagely across the room, smashing chairs. simon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and pounds the back of his skull against the wall. the gargoyle gets his locked fists up and swings them like a war club, smacking simon's face and sprawling him backwards onto the bed. the two, across the room for each other, pause.}

<D>__{where is it?}
<A>__{simon's climbed to his feet, the two men in sunglasses now walking slow circles around each other.}

<D>__{leave me alone.}

<D>__{you've found it, haven't you?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{the gargoyle drops his head and drives himself into simon, who hammers the gargoyle with his fists. blood smears. the gargoyle's gotten free a knife that he jams into simon's leg. pressing home his advantage, the gargoyle slams simon up against the wall. he tears open simon's shirt, digging his fingers into the chest, ripping the skin aside, the first plunging deep, cracking the sternum bone, pushing even further, toward the blood gouged pumping beneath simon plows his knee up between the gargoyle's legs. over and over. till the grip loosens and simon shoves him to one side, using the momentum and drives to swing the body around and at the shattered window. the gargoyle smacks the frame and collapses, his head cracking on the sill and forcing a shard of glass through his neck. simon moves to the window and brushes aside the gargoyle's sunglasses, revealing two totally empty eye sockets. pushing his thumbs into them, simon uses the leverage to lift the gargoyle off the sill and push his body out the window. the gargoyle bounces once on the fire escape, then spread eagles thirty feet to the asphalt. somebody turns up their mexican radio station. the gargoyle's a wreck. but he manages, slowly his shattered remains arguing every inch to climb first to his knees, then miserably to his feet. a bent, splattered, hopeless thing that manages to stumble three or four feet before being hit by a freeway speed firebird bombing down the alley. the impact pins the gargoyle to the grill and rams him into a brick wall, crushing a chest that belches out a sickly, bruised heart like a wet rag against the firebird's windshield.}
<B>__{three floors above}
<A>__{simon leans against his splintered window and looks down at the pinned and very finished body of the gargoyle. his own shirt and pants are a mess of torn blood and his breathing is difficult. pain flashes across his forehead as he checks that his own sunglasses still sit snugly on the bridge of his nose. at the sound of a distant siren simon turns and quickly finishes packing his duffle bag. stiffly pulling on an oversize surplus army jacket that partly conceals the damage beneath, he picks up the bag and painfully shuffles out.}
