<C>__{high priest}
<D>__{do you take her, this earthling, dale arden, to be your empress of the hour? do you solemnly promise to use her as you will not discard her until such time as you grow weary of her?}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{high priest}
<D>__{the wedding ring, please }
<A>__{klytus produces a golden ring, hands it to ming. ming takes dale's left hand, forces it up into position, holds the ring poised to slip it on. ming's face has never been more merciless.}
<C>__{high priest }
<D>__{recite after me with this ring i thee wed }
<C>__{flash's voice}
<D>__{with this ring, i thee wed!}
<A>__{an invisible hand snatches the ring from ming's grip like lightning and james it onto dale's finger.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{flash!!!}
<C>__{flash's voice}
<D>__{run!!!}
<C>__{high angle}
<A>__{pandemonium. dale runs like hell, but is tripped by her train and goes down as ming leaps up onto his throne platform.}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{seal this hall! close every portal!}
<A>__{angle a portal swinging shut, barin squeezing in through it at the last instant, sword in hand. klytus rushes at him with a sword of his own.}
<C>__{ming}
<A>__{looks around wildly, whipping out the sword sheathed at his belt. its blade is like crystal fire. he reacts sharply, catches his breath. what ming sees another sword (flash's voice, ming) exactly like his, a blade of fire, apparently hanging in the air and pointed right at him.}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{where did you get that sword?}
<C>__{flash's voice}
<D>__{from the crystal block.}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{impossible! it could only be pulled by my rightful heir!}
<C>__{flash's voice}
<D>__{how about that?}
<A>__{the sword slowly advances.}
<C>__{feature ming}
<A>__{his face contorted, he flies at invisible flash behind the sword. flash parries the blow. astonishing pyrotechnics as the blades hit each other. shrieking mongons flee under showers of fire.}
