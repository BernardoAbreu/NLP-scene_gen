<A>__{brian and carrie turn to see... adele training a camera on them.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{give me a smile now.}
<A>__{brian and carrie look to one another then force a weak smile. early jumps in and throws a pair of devil's horns up behind brian's unsuspecting head as... the shutter clicks. brian and carrie quickly turn their attention back on the house.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(continues into tape recorder)}
<D>__{neighbors said he was a quiet young man, who was often seen pushing the children on the swing set.}
<A>__{an unusual bird house and a tricycle sit in the front yard. to the side of the house are the remains of an old swing set. carrie finds an interesting angle on the swing set, with the house in the background, snap! she fires off a shot.}

<D>__{everything was fine until the day the family ran out of work for michael, and had to ask him to leave.}
<A>__{as carrie frames up another shot, early crosses in front of her camera. realizing he is in carrie's photo he stops and poses. carrie looks to brian.}

<D>__{sorry, early... could you step out the way, for a second?}
<A>__{early is surprised that they don't want him in the photograph. he wanders away from the front of the house. meanwhile, adele photographs the moment.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{the first one to die was the nine year old daughter...}

<C>__{brian}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{the little girl scans all their faces.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{...my name's brian, what's yours?}
<A>__{the little girl remains silent. brian rolls a look to carrie then back to the little girl.}
<C>__{brian}
