<L>__{exterior verandah day}
<A>__{from below, we hear security whistles. the compound has been breached. dylan looks at the six armed guards surrounding her.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{here we go.}
<A>__{and now she does exactly what she told the thin man she'd do: she pitches forward, ducking her head so the chair's back crashes into the railing, tearing it off. she stands.}
<C>__{dylan }
<D>__{okay, that part worked.}
<A>__{the guards fire but dylan has already launched herself from the railing into that backflip, which lands her on the head of fat boy, flattening him bad, and smashing the rest of the chair into kindling. she grabs the wooden seat and whips it up, catching bullets from guard #3 before flinging it like a frisbee at guard #2, nailing him right on the chin. quickly she stands again, between guards #3 and 4.}
<C>__{dylan }
<D>__{now, guys, i warned you. this is where you shoot each other.}
<A>__{the two men scoff, disbelieving. then dylan does a head fake, both guards panic, and fire, but dylan drops, leaving each man a clear shot at the other. both gape. both fall. just guards #5 and 6 left. dylan's chair arms are still taped to her forearms.}
<C>__{dylan }
<D>__{okay, here's where we improvise.}
<A>__{in a whirl, she overhead chops guard #5. drives her right arm into his shoulder while swinging her left arm into the back of the guard #6's head. charlie's angels 8 18 99 a few more blows, then both men fall. now dylan drops into a second chair, half exhausted, half amused with herself. has one brief beat to take it all in, then bosley steps onto the veranda, sees dylan sitting in the chair. from his point of view: it looks like dylan whose arms are still strapped to the arms of the first chair is taped to the chair she now sits in.}
<C>__{bosley}
<D>__{oh my god, let me help you.}
<A>__{bosley hurries over, "freeing her." amused, dylan lets him. natalie steps out from inside, pausing to kick one guard who was starting to revive.}
