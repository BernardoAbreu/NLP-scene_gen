<A>__{evan, seven, comes to in an old familiar place. we are back in mrs. boswell's first grade class. all of the children draw colorful pictures. evan sees some paper spindles sitting on mrs. boswell's desk. as he heads over to them, mrs. boswell firmly grabs his shoulders and steers him back to his own desk.}
<C>__{mrs. boswell}
<D>__{no monkey business, evan. sit still and finish your drawing.}
<A>__{evan, defeated, looks over at his blank piece of paper. he smiles mischievously, and grabs some colored pencils.}
<C>__{mrs. boswell}
<D>__{that's great everyone! just imagine anything you want to be. there are no limits.}
<A>__{soon enough, an image emerges: evan holding a knife, stands over a heap of several dead inmates karl and rick. when done, he sneaks over to mrs. boswell's desk, where the two paper spindles sit. the metal needles reach up and skewer a number of paper notes and messages. evan looks over to see mrs. boswell holding up his drawing, horrified.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(musically)}
<D>__{oh, mrs. boswelllllllll?}
<A>__{she looks over in time to see evan using all of his seven year old strength to whip his hands down toward the spindles! the moment before his palms reach them there's a brief instant where soundscapes collide and the world behind him vibrates.}
<D>__{and we're back to:}
