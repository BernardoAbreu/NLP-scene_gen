<L>__{exterior the island end of tracks, dock}
<A>__{high up on the slope of the island, indy and marion's mine car shoots out of the black tunnel and roars down toward a little dock at the end of the tracks. a small nazi transport launch, carefully disguised as a greek fishing boat, sits bobbing by the dock. the only human: a nazi sentry dressed as a greek peasant. he is perched on a pile of seed bags which are stacked at the very end of the train tracks. as the mine car barrels noisily down toward him, he throws away some burlap to reveal a mounted machine gun which he spins quickly around toward the approaching mine car. he opens fire. in the out of control mine car, indy pulls marion down with him. they are squashed into the corner trying to avoid contact with the bouncing ark. bullets clang against the outside of the car and whiz inches overhead. indy and marion are forced into a tighter and tighter embrace of life. at the machine gun post, the nazi sentry has been firing like crazy, but now there is terror in his eyes. he realizes the car is not going to stop. he lacks faith in his stronghold. too late. the mine car smashes into the seed bag bunker. and right on through. the nazi sentry, his machine gun and a dozen bursting seed bags are slammed into the ocean in a wild, hurtling mass. the mine car jumps, bounces and spins around, then slides to a stop in a cloud of seed at the edge of the water.}
