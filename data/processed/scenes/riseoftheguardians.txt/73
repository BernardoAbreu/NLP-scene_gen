<D>__{whoa ??}
<A>__{pitch disperses a stream of nightmare sand, turning it into a gigantic sickle and swings it back at sandy. jack ducks, avoiding injury as sandy's pushed back against a ledge. sandy quickly grabs pitch with another dreamsand stream and yanks him off his feet, slamming him repeatedly against the tops of the buildings until finally throwing him off the rooftop. pitch bounces off the ground as he crashes into an empty street. as sandy dusts his hands and calmly steps off the rooftop to follow, jack looks on, astonished.}
