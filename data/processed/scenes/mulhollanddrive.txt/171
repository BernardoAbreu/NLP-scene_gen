<L>__{interior recording studio day}
<A>__{we see what looks like a recording studio right out of the}
<L>__{1960's. we're looking through a plate of glass. a blonde}
<A>__{girl is standing at a vintage microphone. behind her are three back up male vocalists dressed in three tone, shiny}
<L>__{60's suits. we hear strings soar up and the blonde girl}
<A>__{begins to sing sixteen reasons by connie stevens. the male vocalists backing her up flawlessly. we move back and realize we are on a movie set inside a sound stage. a screen test is being shot of the girl and as we continue moving back we see the director adam kesher surrounded by his crew. behind them there are many people standing, eating, watching, working. the stage is full and bustling. the song plays loudly over. sarah and nicki bring betty into this scene through a giant stage door. a guard mimes for them to be quiet as they approach the set. the song continues to play over. as sarah leads betty up close adam turns and his eyes fall on the beautiful face of betty elms. sensing something betty turns and sees adam. they each seem to feel the thrill of the thunderbolt, but each embarrassed to stare longer than they already have turn back and watch the girl finish the song.}

<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(lightly pinching her cheek)}
<D>__{see ya later.}
<A>__{adam turns and goes back out of the set onto the stage floor. he looks around. he sees betty being introduced by sarah to some of the studio executives. he goes over to his assistant director and looks down at the man's notepad.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{who's next, hank?}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{camilla rhodes.}
<A>__{adam wonders worries.}

<C>__{hank}
<D>__{all ready.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{bring her out.}
<A>__{hank speaks into his walkie talkie headset. the sound of his voice can be heard in several locations throughout the stage.}
<C>__{hank}
<P>__{(through walkie talkie)}
<D>__{camilla rhodes next!}
<A>__{adam looks up a beautiful blonde steps into the set in front of the microphone. it is the girl! the back up singers step in behind her. adam nods to hank.}
<C>__{hank }
<D>__{turn over!}
<A>__{the cameraman calls out, "speed".}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(through megaphone)}
<D>__{playback!}
<A>__{countdown before the music begins.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{action!}
<A>__{the strings soar up and camilla rhodes begins to sing. on the set betty hears the song again and turns and watches. once again her eyes find adam as his eyes are finding hers. this time adam turns away. he watches camilla for a moment. she is passable, but not spectacular. adam reaches out and pulls hank over to him.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{adam pauses.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{get jason over here.}
<A>__{hank gets on his walkie talkie.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{cindy ... adam wants to see jason.}
<A>__{adam continues to watch camilla rhodes sing. jason goldwyn, a tall sixty year old silver haired man, comes through the crowd and stops at adam's side. he looks down at adam, but adam continues watching camilla rhodes. jason follows adam's gaze and he watches camilla sing then turns back to adam. adam slowly looks up right into jason's eyes wondering how much jason knows, but jason's face doesn't give away a thing.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{did you want to tell me something, adam?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{this is the girl!}
<A>__{at that moment ray, having overheard, comes to jason's side. he smiles at adam.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{excellent choice, adam.}
<A>__{adam is sick with himself. across the room betty panics when she looks at her watch.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{oh ... oh...i have to be somewhere. i promised a friend.}
<A>__{she quickly shakes sarah's and nicki's hands saying, "i'm sorry, i'm sorry" and runs off like cinderella. adam turns and sees her running off out of his world. chris isaak's song "except the new girl" segues in over connie stevens and plays as adam, sarah and nicki watch betty disappear out the sound stage door.}
