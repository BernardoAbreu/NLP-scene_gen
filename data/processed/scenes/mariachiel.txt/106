<A>__{domino is dabbing hydrogen peroxide onto a cotton swab. she applies it to mariachi's body scars on his back. mariachi has his eyes closed. he washes the blood from his face.}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{where were you when he came into the bar?}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{i was on the phone, talking to a friend that knows what's going on.}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{did you mention me?}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{no... he told me the man in black is azul.}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{if his name is azul, why doesn't he wear blue?}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{i don't know... anyway, he's killing the men of the town drug dealer. the dealer's name is mauricio. but he's known as moco.}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{and moco is sending these men to find azul. so, why do they chase me?}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{they have never seen azul... only moco knows him. my friend says the description moco gave his men was that he wears black, and carries a guitar case. sounds like you, no?}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{couldn't you tell your friend that there are two people like that in his town? one is a killer, and one is a mariachi.}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{only special people can talk to moco. besides, you've killed a few of his men, now. your best option is to keep out of sight, stop wearing black, and to hide that stupid case until this is all over.}
