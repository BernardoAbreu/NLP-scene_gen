<D>__{benjamin barker!}
<A>__{the factory whistle screams a steady, terrible blast as todd brutally slashes the judge's throat severing his jugular the spray of blood drenches todd he pulls the lever and sends the body tumbling out of sight down the chute. the music continues... as todd stands for a long moment, blood dripping from his face, exalted. then he sinks to his knees, overcome. the music stops. a long beat of silence. then todd looks at his razor deeply:}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{rest now, my friend, rest now forever, sleep now the untroubled sleep of the angels.}
<A>__{then silence as he reverently sets the razor on the floor and looks at it. we focus on his face. his quest is completed. his demons silenced. the ghosts are gone. it's done. he just kneels there. no reason to move. no purpose in life. then... a sound from the chest. a slight thump. his eyes dart to the chest. he slowly picks up his razor and moves to the chest. then suddenly wrenches it open and hauls out johanna }
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(darkly)}
<D>__{come for a shave, have you, lad?}

<A>__{suddenly a piercing scream echoes up from the chute mrs. lovett's voice screaming to raise the dead todd rivets johanna, pointing the razor at her, a lethal warning:}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{forget my face.}
<A>__{he spins and bolts out of the shop, leaving her sitting in the chair }
