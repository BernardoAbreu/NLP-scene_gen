<L>__{interior tudor's apartment late afternoon}
<A>__{tudor enters his apartment and throws his jacket and attache case on to a chair. he loosens his tie and makes himself a drink, then sits down on the sofa and switches on the tv set. after only a short moment of relative calm, tudor suddenly contracts into the fetal position, spilling his drink on to the floor. he rolls on to the floor, eyes staring out of his head, mouth opening and closing like that of a fish out of water, tendons in his neck bulging with tension. he soon manages to struggle to his feet, the primary spasm of pain apparently over. he keeps both hands clamped over his mouth as though in a vain attempt to forestall a bout of vomiting and stumbles into the bathroom. once in the bathroom, tudor throws himself over the side of the bathtub, knees on the bath mat, head well down into the tub itself. he gags and vomits into the tub and collapses, exhausted, on the floor, mouth bloody. in the tub, a trail of blood streaked slime leads into the drain.}
