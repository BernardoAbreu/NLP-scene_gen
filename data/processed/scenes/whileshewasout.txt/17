<A>__{a few cars pass della in the night. their lights are like torches in the suburban wilderness.}
<L>__{interior ford explorer exterior pleasant valley drive evening}
<A>__{there is the familiar ring of a cellular phone. della has programmed one of those "oh so cute" recognizable tunes into it, like the "william tell overture". della holds the wheel with one hand and fumbles through her purse with the other. she eventually locates the phone.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{della, it's mary messina.}
<A>__{della rolls her eyes. this is not a welcome call.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{oh, hey.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{you okay sweetie?}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{sure. how are you?}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{i'm well.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{how'd you get my cell number?}
<A>__{della balances the phone while she drags on her cigarette.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{i called kenneth at the house.}
<A>__{oh great. she exhales sharply.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{and how'd that go? did he give you an earful for disturbing his ninety ninth viewing of lethal weapon four?}
<A>__{mary giggles.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{oh della. kenneth is always charming. at least to me.}
<A>__{the car flashes past the decorated sign for a local school. before della can stop herself, the words are out.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{well, with the way you flaunt your double d boob job at the free fun pta events that's hardly a surprise.}
<A>__{fortunately for her the phone happens to make a deep metallic distortion at that moment.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{oh nothing, mary.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{you got lucky with that one. patricia ellis says he's the best looking guy in pleasant valley.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{well that wouldn't be hard. mary, do you need something? cause i gotta go.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{yes, are you going to tool school tomorrow?}
<A>__{mary giggles at her own joke. della sighs. this is why she is having her serenity interrupted?}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{tool school?, ouch, mary. do it yourself mechanics is without a doubt the most interesting thing in my life right now.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i carry my beloved toolbox in the trunk at all times.}
<A>__{the desolate road disappears behind della. she passes a roadside memorial.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{i'm just joking, della. you know me. i pre paid ten classes and only made it to two. if you are going i could use a ride. i'd hate to miss another class.}
<A>__{if della was going before, she's not now.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{sorry, mary, i'm skipping this week. kenneth's parents are coming to stay for christmas. you know how it is.}
<A>__{a red light looms ahead. della slows.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{oh that's too bad. maybe patricia ellis will be going.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{you check with her, mary.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{merry christmas. god bless you and your family.}
<A>__{christmas lights outline a few distant houses.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{you too.}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{bah humbug.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{pardon?}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{bye, mary.}
<A>__{della stops at the red light. she clicks off the phone and lets it lay on her lap. she rakes about among a bunch of kids stuff in the back seat, casts aside, an anorak, mittens, a sock. she finds what she's looking for, a bottle of water, caught on the bar under the passenger seat. it's only a third full but she takes a sip, recoils from its coldness. the light changes. she throws the bottle into the back seat.}
