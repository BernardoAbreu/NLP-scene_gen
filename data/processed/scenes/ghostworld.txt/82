<L>__{interior community center evening}
<A>__{a homemade banner reads: "high school art show brotherhood and community: art as dialogue." along one wall is all the work from roberta's class: a collection of eccentric abstract bric a brac and enid's large painting. the painting has drawn a small crowd. we see a chain of events beginning with three parents talking to a matronly director curator who in turn seeks out roberta (wearing make up and fancy ish clothes for the first time).}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{i'm afraid you're simply going to have to take that painting down. several of the parents have complained.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i will do no such thing.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{then you leave me no other choice than to remove it myself!}
<A>__{she marches towards it. roberta runs after her.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i think we should give the artist a chance to talk to the parents about her intentions with this piece... we should be promoting discussion as a solution, not censorship.}
<A>__{roberta sees margaret and grabs her.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{margaret, have you seen enid?}
<A>__{margaret shrugs "no." roberta looks through the crowd. a college age news hack type with a free weekly t shirt snaps a photo of the director removing enid's painting.}
