<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior space later}
<A>__{the shuttle hurtles though a massive asteroid field.}
<C>__{prowl }
<D>__{slow down, ironhide. we want to get to autobot city in one piece.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior the shuttle}
<A>__{ironhide is at the controls.}
<C>__{ironhide}
<D>__{if i can dodge dececpticon rays, i can sure as shootin' dodge a couple of asteroids.}
<A>__{suddenly, there is a terrible bang! on the side of the ship, and the two autobots are thrown from their seats.}
<C>__{prowl}
<D>__{you were saying?}
<C>__{ironhide }
<D>__{that wasn't an asteroid. there is a blast of light and they turn to see...}
<B>__{angle on the ship}
<A>__{the most powerful laser light anybody has ever seen cuts a gaping hole in the side of the ship... then, when the light clears, a panel of the ship falls in and we see megatron! in all his glory.}
<C>__{megatron}
<D>__{die autobots!}
<A>__{then, he transforms to gun mode, spins into starscream's arms and starscream fires.}
<C>__{brawn}
<D>__{is cut in half by megatron's blast.}
<B>__{on prowl}
<A>__{as scavenger melts him down.}
<C>__{the insecticons}
<D>__{...eat away at the hole in the shuttle to make way for... ...an army of other decepticons including laserbeak who enter, firing.}
<B>__{ironhide and ratchet}
<A>__{while firing back are fused together... ... then blasted apart and fall in smoking, glowing fragments.}
<B>__{on starscream and megatron}
<A>__{as they enter the now empty ship, a number of decepticons flood past them, taking positions and searching for other living autobots.}
<C>__{megatron}
<D>__{this was almost too easy, starscream.}
<C>__{starscream}
<D>__{much easier, oh mighty megatron, than attacking the real threat: the autobots moon base.}
<C>__{megatron}
<D>__{you're an idiot, starscream. were we simply to wipe out that minuscule base, they could build another one.}
<C>__{megatron }
<D>__{but when we slip by their security systems in their own ship and destroy autobot city, the autobots will be vanquished forever!}
<C>__{ironhide}
<D>__{fat chance, megatron!}
<A>__{ironhide pulls himself up and grabs onto megatron who flings him against the wall.}
<C>__{megatron}
<D>__{such heroic nonsense!}
