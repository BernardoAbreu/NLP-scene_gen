<L>__{interior st. regis hotel executive buffet morning}
<A>__{the executive buffet is a staple at the st. regis. a long center table with silver trays houses eggs and breakfast meats. fruit, bagels and a staff of servers cater to the business elite of atlanta. charlie anderson sits at a corner table with hugh lang, a young, well dressed african american man. charlie and hugh are chatting in jocular spirit when whip approaches, walking much more confidently with his cane.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{whip, hey buddy. glad you got my message. grab a seat.}

<D>__{len is the president of the pilots' union and he wanted to be here with us and meet with you but they wanted him at the crash site. so..}
<A>__{whip is quiet, anxious to hear the purpose of the meeting.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{whip, as you know, when a plane crashes, the ntsb sends a "go team" to the crash site immediately.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{they find the flight data recorders?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yes they found them, perfectly intact.}
<C>__{whip}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hugh's an attorney who specializes in criminal negligence }

<D>__{criminal negligence?}
<A>__{the waitress returns with the coffee. it's quiet as they wait for her to finish. she does.}
<C>__{hugh}
<A>__{death demands responsibility. six dead on that plane, someone has to pay.}
<C>__{whip}
<A>__{the plane fell apart at 30 thousand feet.}
<C>__{charlie}
<A>__{the airline will try to prove equipment failure. which would make the manufacturer responsible. the manufacturer of the plane will try to prove poor maintenance of the equipment by the airline.}
<C>__{hugh}
<A>__{or pilot error.}
<C>__{whip}
<A>__{i had to fly that plane inverted, that means upside down, hugh. do you get the picture? 100 passengers hanging upside down, 500 feet off the ground. do you have any idea what that sounds like?}
<C>__{hugh}
<A>__{i do. i heard the black box last night.}
<C>__{whip}
<A>__{are you a pilot?}
<C>__{hugh lang}
<A>__{no i'm not.}
<C>__{whip}

<A>__{they interview the entire flight crew and the passengers. they hold}

<C>__{whip}
<D>__{charlie, what do i need to know? i'm already tired of this guy.}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{the ntsb `go team' collects blood, skin and hair from the flight crew for a toxicology report.}
<A>__{whip studies the two men, trying to read their poker hands.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{when did they do that?}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{in the hospital. it's the first thing they do. do you remember having your blood drawn on the night of the crash?}

<D>__{comin' up.}
<A>__{an awkward silence as they wait for her to clear out.}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{an initial report shows alcohol in your bloodstream at a level of .24. in the u.s. one of the most lenient drunk driving countries in the world you go to jail for driving with a number over .08. and by driving, i mean a car.}
<A>__{they all digest the information as the waitress delivers the cinnamon rolls. she leaves. it's still quiet.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{what does that mean? i had a beer the night before i flew. and what...that made the tail of the plane explode?}

<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{we're talking about prison not funerals. somebody has }
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{to write checks, well it's not me i promise you that. and as long as they're writing checks, write me one because someone put me in a broken plane. i'd love a check.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{easy whip }
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{this tox report states that you were drunk and high on cocaine, felonies punishable by 24 years in jail. and if your intoxication is proven to have caused the death of the 4 passengers you'll get 4 counts of manslaughter. that could be life in prison. can i now do my job on your behalf and kill this tox report? whip is listening. charlie tries to reign it in.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{he'll get it done, whip. it's what his entire life is about. trust me, trust him.}
<P>__{(whip stares at hugh)}
