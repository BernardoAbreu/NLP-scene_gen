<A>__{something is rising from the black hills. a sphere of light, too red to be the sun. a sphere of contained fire, undulating in crimson and ochre, and rising slowly, majestically, to the pulse. to the drum. it is the sun. but it is a paha sapa sunrise. a black hills sunrise. and it is spectacular. the drum, pounds deeper, bigger, as the sun gets higher. stronger. igniting a vast landscape of gentle slopes and foothills; throwing shadows on the plains that look like, as the indians say, an old man dancing. the grass is golden. and high. the wind moves through it, snakes through it. slowly.}
<B>__{begin credits.}
<A>__{voices; a traditional indian song (lakota), summoning wakan tanka the great mystery. and now, rising up over one of the small land waves, a head comes into view. shoulders. a man, running in ghostly slow motion, his long black hair trailing in the wind. the indian man wears only buckskin pants and a bone choker around his neck. legs and arms churning, the man runs with antelope grace, backlit by the sunrise, bounding toward us. running... his heart pounding. song rising... drum pounding... five more voices in high pitched tremolo join the song. and then the runner soars, like an eagle from a bluff, airborne, flying over a small dip, arms outstretched, and it would be a wondrous thing if there were not a fine, crimson, mist all around him and if slow motion was not suddenly overtaken by live speed, revealing the brutal force of gunfire which has slammed the indian into the air, throwing him. slamming him hard into the grass. and it is over as quickly and violently as a deer shot dead. lakota song ends abruptly. long shot the great plains the sun burns like lava at the horizon. drum beats like a heart. and somewhere off in a distant cottonwood, an owl. then silence. deep, disturbing stillness.}

<D>__{immaculate.}
<A>__{ray gestures to carl and he nervously sets his briefcase on the counter, fumbles with the first latch. the second. he flips it open. the fence man casts his eyes down at a neat cache of grade a treasury. a lot of it. then his eyes rise to carl.}

<D>__{f.b.i.! get your face on the fuckin' floor! move!}
<A>__{carl startled, does an almost effeminate dip down to one knee, but that knee is swept out from under him, slapping him flat onto plywood where he is instantly frisked down by the fence man who is wielding a 9 mm handgun. but the white collar criminal is more stunned by the fact that ray is walking across the floor with his hands in his pockets over to the mr. coffee. he pours one, and adds some milk. turns and watches the bust while opening a packet of sweet n'low.}

<C>__{louis}
<D>__{make sure ya spell my name right.}
<A>__{ray just stares for a moment. then hurries out the door. carl, being arm gripped by two agents and photographed like a trout, gazes bewildered at the door.}

<A>__{seated, at the far end of the table, engrossed in the deep spread of information, sa (special agent) frank couture is about to break the record for longest single ash on the end of a cigarette and the smoke forces his eyes into tight, concentrating, slits. "cooch" as they call him in the bureau has seen thirty years in some rough "provinces". he has survived the hoover era and is a legend in the sessions era but survival has honed an edge. an edge with a touch of ironic cop humor. ray enters, walks into a firm shake.}

<C>__{tully}
<D>__{ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as the badlands. indian reservation.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{it's not the first. there's been several. and our field office in rapid city is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.}
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{the main problem is, ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non indians. relations have not been amicable.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{different culture. hard to penetrate. the indians don't like white cops poking around. and that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an american indian agent.}
<A>__{tully straightens the edges of a bureau memorandum.}
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{with an indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a cointelpro, selective operations unit, and it'll be easier on agent couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe }
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{woh, excuse me, sir... i see what you're saying... i've got a little indian blood, that's true. but }

<D>__{i didn't know him, sir. he passed away when i was six.}

<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{don't worry about it, ray. as long as the people have proof that we sent them one of their own, no one's gonna ask you to weave baskets or make it rain.}
<A>__{ray sits before the files and photos, looking unsure. he has come to garner a promotion but has just been sent to the graveyard. or in the fbi argot, indian country. tully pivots his leather chair in a full circle and slaps an assignment folder down in front of the young agent.}

<L>__{interior le baron moving}
<A>__{cooch is at the wheel. ray, passenger. his lap is a desk for several folders, and he works through them as they drive. both agents eat a sandwich as they travel.}

<A>__{cooch opens a folder that sits between them, and taking his eyes off the road for a dangerous five seconds, locates some photos, and hands them to ray. ray's expression tells us they are not pretty.}
<C>__{cooch}

<C>__{ray}
<D>__{were you in nam?}

<D>__{you crashed my file?}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{no. i consulted it. we're going into indian country, i wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. don't you?}
<A>__{ray has finished his sandwich. he wipes his hands on a kerchief while taking in the sight of chalky buttes cramming roadside.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you've been in the bureau for thirty years. you survived the hoov, the black panthers and abscam. i don't see any bullet holes. that's good enough for me.}

"leaving bear creak indian reservation." and immediately pulling in front of a squat old bar with a burned out neon miller light. dwight yoakum croons "youuuuuu got your little ways" on the jukebox from inside. the buffalo butte bar has several cracked and sun bleached buffalo skulls hanging off the edge of its flat roof and big faded white letters painted across the front read: "no indians allowed." (this sign actually exists today in the res line border town of scenic, south dakota). the car pulls up beside a pick up and parks. ray and cooch step out, careful to walk wide around a pitbull in the bed of the truck. a white local walks out of the bar and looks askance at the suits. as the two feds approach the bar, cooch looks up at the warning sign. ray sees it too.}
