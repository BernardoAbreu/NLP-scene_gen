<L>__{exterior depot night}
<A>__{crane down from a faded sign, tony's automania, high above what was once a car dealership, but is now a fenced in depot full of vehicles. a huge white face with black cartoon eyes pops into view, attached to a ten foot tall body emblazoned tony baloney. it's one of those vinyl advertising dummies that does the hula as air pumps through it. tony's arms wave wildly, like a giant zombie, comic yet oddly unnerving as... blam! blam! bullets hit it in the face and neck. gus, a young soldier, and his partner barrett, are shooting outside the sales office of the car lot turned depot. a sign is printed on the window. "best deals in town and that's no baloney!"}
