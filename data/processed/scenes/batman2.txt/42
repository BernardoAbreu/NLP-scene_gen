<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior waterfront district night}
<A>__{snow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming gotham harbor. foghorns blare in the distance as a pair of stiletto heels totally inappropriate for the weather click across the sidewalk and pause at mid block, where a wide wooden plank leads down from street level to a seedy hole in the wall bar: the wharf rat.}
<L>__{interior wharf rat night}
<A>__{a roughneck joint, about as trendy as the average bait shack. the clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving up for their next tattoo. a tv over the bar is tuned to the late news:}
<C>__{anchorwoman}
<D>__{...and tomorrow, the city's power elite will be turning out in force to greet millionaire industrialist walter barrett, who returns to gotham after a five year stay in europe...}
<A>__{the bartender switches to a hockey game, because none of the rowdies at the bar give a shit about walter barrett. none, that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named ricky, who gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner. moments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic, vaguely eurasian features. she's dark and elegant, fine boned, regal of bearing and her name, though we don't know it yet, is selina kyle. she's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the wharf rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir. a longshoreman at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the felt. two blowsy whores size her up territorially as she finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene indifference. the regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops. the only guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is ricky, who's still on the phone:}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{yo. ricky here. what's the haps?}
<A>__{in mid conversation he notices selina. she smiles invitingly right at him. mildly startled, he smiles back.}
<C>__{ricky }
<D>__{midnight. no sweat. see you then.}
<A>__{he hangs up eagerly. then, with a deep breath, he hitches up his pants and swaggers over to selina's end of the bar.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{well. "ricky," is it?}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{how'd you know that?}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{i heard you on the phone. talking to your girlfriend.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{girlfriend? no, no. that was business.}
<A>__{selina makes a big show of peeling off her gloves.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{if you've got time for a little pleasure ...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink.}
<A>__{she clasps his hand. his eyes bug out. three enormous rings, a diamond bracelet there must be several thousand in rocks on her left hand alone. ricky gapes at the sparklers, bedazzled.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{jeez they look almost real.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{why wouldn't they be?}
<A>__{ricky is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought is all too evident. he swallows hard and tries not to stare.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{you'd have to be crazy. nobody'd wear the real thing to a dive like this.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{oh, they're real, all right. so are these.}
<A>__{she waves her fingernails long, polished, and talon sharp in front of his eyes. with lightning speed, before he can react, she pins his wrist to the bar and with one quick stroke carves a thin bloody stripe in the back of his hand. selina's eyes flash as he gasps in shock. he tries to jerk his hand away, but he can't break her grip. then her dominance firmly established she releases his hand with a coy, cheshire cat smile.}
<C>__{selina }
<D>__{weren't we going to have a drink?}
<A>__{he blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily. she takes his wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and laps gently at the blood. ricky is hypnotized. she's got an odd way of flirting, but ricky finds it somehow intriguing. he dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals to the bartender.}
