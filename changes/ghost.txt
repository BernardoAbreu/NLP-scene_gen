<ACTION>__{The CAMERA TRACKS slowly through clouds of moving dust. Shafts of muted light pierce the dense atmosphere. An eerie netherworld envelops us. Strange ghostly forms appear and disappear in the distance. They seem like apparitions. Broken timbers and dangling cables emerge from the smoky light. We see hints of a huge demolished space. An old white plaster wall FILLS THE SCREEN. Momentary blips of light flash across it. SOUNDS of street traffic are heard dimly in the distance. With startling impact, the SOUND of a sledgehammer explodes out of nowhere. The wall shudders. HAMMER BLOWS assault the audience. They are loud and jarring. The wall buckles. Chunks of plaster CRASH to the floor. The air fills with new swirls of white dust. The SLEDGEHAMMER smashes INTO VIEW. Beams of sunlight cut through the cracks, piercing the atmosphere like searchlights in a fog. A huge section of wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into the air. We hear voices talking.}
<CHAR>__{MOLLY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(O.S.)}

<CHAR>__{SAM } <CHAR_PAR>__{(O.S.)}
<DIAL>__{I told you!}

<ACTION>__{The CAMERA MOVES IN and for the first time we see them. MOLLY JENSEN, in her late 20's, has a bandanna around her hair and a workman's mask over her nose, but we can tell from her eyes and cheekbones that she is beautiful. SAM WHEAT, in his late 30's, is also hidden behind a mask, but he has a strong forehead and handsome features. Sweat is dripping down his brow, leaving streaks in the dust. CARL BRUNER, early 30's, removes his mask revealing a good looking young man with a fashionable two-day stubble. Both men have their shirts off.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{ANGLE}
<ACTION>__{BLACKNESS AND A LOUD THUD. Suddenly a shaft of light penetrates the darkness. Another thud and more light. We see a hole. The hook of a crowbar enters it, grappling with something around the edges. Then, with a tug and a loud yank, a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor. Huge clouds of dust fly into the air. Molly looks up, astonished.}

She bites her lip. Sam eyes her moonlit form as she strokes his chest, slowly moving her fingers down his torso, around the curve of his hips, and then digging into the back of his jeans.

Before he can move, it pierces him between the ribs and slices into his heart. His body quivers. Carl's eyes bulge from their sockets. His body begins to spasm. He can't get up.
