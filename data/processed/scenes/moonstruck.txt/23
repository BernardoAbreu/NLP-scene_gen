<A>__{this is the source of the vicki carr song, which is just ending. cosmo castorini, loretta's father is just turning off the old stereo. he is a powerful man, about 65, with a huge shock of white hair and gold wire glasses. he's wearing a big old red silk robe over blue pajamas, and royal blue slippers. the room it filled with lumpy upholstered furniture, once grand, now threadbare; shawls and doilies cover holes in failing fabric. there's a fireplace containing a dying fire. cosmo's wing chair, with his newspaper on it, is beside a lit fringed lamp. cosmo sees loretta as she comes in.}
