<L>__{interior publishing house reception area day}
<A>__{it's grand and modern. random house knopf taschen is etched on the wall in large gold letters. an old woman enters carrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages. she seems haunted, hollow eyed, sickly. the young receptionist, dressed in a shiny, stretchy one piece pantsuit, looks up.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{oh, hi.}
<C>__{old woman}
<P>__{(apologetically)}
<D>__{hi, i was in the neighborhood and thought i'd see }
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{i think he's in a conference. unfortunately. i'm really sorry.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{would you just try him? you never know. as long as i'm here. you never know.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{of course. please have a seat.}
<A>__{the old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her lap. she stares politely straight ahead.}
<C>__{receptionist }
<P>__{(quietly into headset)}
<D>__{it's her i know, but couldn't you just yes, i know, but i know, but she's old and it would be a nice yes, sorry.}
<P>__{(to old woman)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now. it's a crazy time of year for us.}
<A>__{the receptionist gestures toward a christmas tree in the corner. its ornaments are holograms.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{this book it's essential that people read it because }
<P>__{(gravely, patting the manuscript)}
<D>__{ it's the truth. and only i know it.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<P>__{(nodding sympathetically)}
<D>__{maybe after the holidays then.}
<L>__{interior tiled hallway day}
<A>__{the old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway hall. she stops to catch her breath, then continues and passes several archway with letters printed above them. when she arrives at one topped by an ll, she slips a card in a slot. a plastic molded chair drops into the archway. she sits in the chair; it rises.}
<L>__{interior tube day}
<A>__{the woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a line of chairs shooting through a glass tube. the other chairs are peopled with commuters. we stay with the woman as she and the others travel over new york city in the tube. there are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the skyline. the woman glances at the manuscript in her lap. it's called: eternal sunshine of the spotless mind this serves as the movie's opening title. the other credits follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes. their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank.}
<L>__{interior waiting room day}
<A>__{subtitled: fifty years earlier every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall, magazines on end tables, a sad looking potted plant, generic seascape paintings on the walls. the receptionist, mary, 25, can be seen typing in the reception area. behind her are shelves and shelves of medical files. the door opens and clementine enters. she's in her early thirties, zaftig in a faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt. she's decidedly funky and has blue hair. mary looks up.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{may i help you?}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(approaching reception area)}
<D>__{yeah, hi, i have a one o'clock with dr. mierzwiak. clementine kruczynski.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yes, please have a seat. he'll be right with you.}
<A>__{clementine sits. she looks tired, maybe hungover. she picks up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest.}
<L>__{interior inner office area continuous}
<A>__{mary pads down the hallway. she knocks on a closed door.}
<C>__{mierzwiak }
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{mary opens the door, peeks in. howard mierzwiak, 40's, professional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{howard, your one o'clock.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{thanks, mary. you can bring her in.}
<A>__{she smiles and nods. it's clear she's in love. it's equally clear that mierzwiak doesn't have a clue. mary turns to leave.}
<C>__{mierzwiak }
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{mary...}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(turning back)}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{order me a pastrami for after?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{cole slaw, ice tea?}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{welcome, howard.}
<A>__{she smiles and heads down the hall. stan, 30's, tall, spindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{boo.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{she glances back nervously at mierzwiak's open door.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{barely seen you all morning, kiddo.}
<A>__{he leans in to kiss her. she cranes her neck to keep him off.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(reprimanding whisper)}
<D>__{stan... c'mon...}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{sorry. i just }
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(somewhat guiltilly)}
<D>__{it's just...y'know... i mean...}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i know. anyway }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{anyway, i've got to do my tap dance here.}
<A>__{she indicates the door to the reception area. stan nods.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{see you later, alligator.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{'kay.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{hey, if you're ordering lunch for mierzwiak, would you }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i better do this, stan.}
<A>__{stan nods again and mary opens the door to the waiting room.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{ms. kruczynski?}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{after a moment, clementine appears in the doorway. mary leads her down the hall, not looking back.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(professionally courteous)}
<D>__{how are you today?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{okay, i guess.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(at mierzwiak's office)}
<D>__{here we are.}
<A>__{mierzwiak steps out from behind his desk.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{ms. kruczynski, please come in.}
<A>__{clementine enters the office. mary smiles at mierzwiak and closes the door, leaving them alone.}
<L>__{interior office continuous}
<A>__{mierzwiak directs clementine to a chair next to a coffee table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues. mierzwiak sits across from her. he smiles.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{how are you today?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{okay, i guess.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<P>__{(nodding sympathetically)}
<D>__{well, why don't you tell me what's going on? do you mind if i turn this on?}
<A>__{he indicates a tape recorder.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<A>__{he turns it on, smiles at her, gestures for her to begin.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{well, i've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, i guess.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{you guess he's your boyfriend? or you guess you're having a bad time with hm?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{what? no. i don't like the term boyfriend. it's so gay.}
<A>__{mierzwiak nods. he's attentive, pleasant, and neutral throughout.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{maybe gay isn't the right word. but, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. heheh. my significant other... heh heh. and i guess on a certain level, i want to break it off, but i feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. do i end it? should i give it more time? i'm not happy, but what do i expect? relationships require work. you know the drill. the thing that i keep coming back to is, i'm not getting any younger, i want to have a baby... at some pointerior.. maybe... right? so then i think i should settle which is not necessarily the best word i mean, he's a good guy. it's not really settling. then i think maybe i'm just a victim of movies, y'know? that i have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. but then i think, no, this is what i really want, so i should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. you know? agreed? but then i think he is a good guy and... it's complicated. y'know?}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{i think i know. i think we can help. why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. everything you can think of. everything about him. everything about you. and we'll take it from there.}
<A>__{she nods, thinks.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{um, well, he's a fucking tidy one }
<L>__{exterior commuter train station}
<A>__{subtitle: two weeks later the platform is crowded with business commuters. joel is among them. he is in his 30's, gaunt, and holding a briefcase. the platform across the tracks from him is empty. suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd. he climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass to the empty platform. soon an almost empty train pulls up to that platform. joel gets on and watches the business commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the station.}
<L>__{exterior montauk train station later}
<A>__{joel talks on a phone. the wind howls around him. he tries to shield the mouthpiece as he talks.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{hi, cindy. joel. listen, i'm not feeling well this morning. no. food poisoning, i think. sorry it took me so long to call in, but i've been vomiting.}
<L>__{exterior beach day}
<A>__{joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase. he passes an old man with a metal detector. they nod at each other. later: joel looks out at the ocean. later: joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook. he opens it and writes with a gloved hand.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{january 13th, 2006. today i skipped work and took the train out to montauk.}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{it's cold.}
<P>__{(thinks some more)}
<D>__{the sky is gray.}
<P>__{(thinks some more)}
<D>__{i don't know what else to say. nothing happens. nothing changes. i saw naomi last night. we had sex. it was weird to fall into our old familiar sex life so easily. like no time has passed. after two years apart suddenly we're talking about getting together again. i guess that's good.}
<A>__{he has no other thoughts. he glances up, spots a female figure in the distance, walking in his direction. she stands out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded sweatshirt. it's clementine. he watches her for a bit, then as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least pretends to. once she passed, he watches her walk away. she stops and stares out at the ocean. joel writes.}
<D>__{joel (v.o.) (cont'd) if i'm constitutionally incapable of making eye contact with a woman i don't know. i guess i'd better get back to naomi.}
<A>__{later: joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the season. he peeks cautiously in a dark window. later: joel digs into the sand with a stick.}
<L>__{interior diner day}
<A>__{it's a local tourist place, but off season empty. joel sits in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup. an elderly couple drink coffee at the counter. clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood. joel glances at her bright blue hair. she picks an empty booth and sits. joel studies her discreetly. the waitress approaches her with a coffee pot.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{coffee?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{god, yes. you've saved my life!}
<A>__{the waitress pours the coffee.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{you know what you want yet?}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{ain't that the question of the century.}
<A>__{the waitress is not amused.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{you got grilled cheese and tomato soup?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{yeah. we're having a run on it.}
<A>__{the waitress heads to the grill. clementine fishes in her bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment, pours something in, then brings the cup back up.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{and some cream, please.}
<A>__{clementine looks around the place. her eyes meet joel's before he is able to look away. she smiles vaguely. he looks embarrassed, then down at his journal. clementine pulls a book from her purse and starts to read. joel glances up, tries to see the cover. it's blue. he can't read the title.}
<L>__{exterior beach day}
<A>__{joel stares out at the ocean. far down the beach clementine stares at it, too. joel glances sideways at her then back at the ocean.}
<L>__{exterior montauk train station platform late afternoon}
<A>__{joel sits on the bench waiting for a train. clementine enters the platform, sees joel, the only other person there. she waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if they're old friends. he waves back, embarrassed. she takes a seat on a bench far down the platform. joel stares at his hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to conceal his awkwardness.}
<L>__{interior train a bit later}
<A>__{joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the slowly passing desolate terrain. after a moment the door between cars opens and clementine enters. joel looks up. clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding where to sit. she settles on a seat at the opposite end of the car. joel looks out the window. he feels her watching him. the train is picking up speed. finally:}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(calling over the rumble)}
<D>__{hi!}
<A>__{joel looks over.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{why what?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{why are you sorry? i just said hi.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{no, i didn't know if you were talking to me, so...}
<A>__{she looks around the empty car.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{joel}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{well, i didn't want to assume.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{aw, c'mon, live dangerously. take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{anyway. sorry. hi.}
<A>__{clementine makes her way down the aisle towards joel.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{it's okay if i sit closer? so i don't have to scream. not that i don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but i don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{no, i mean, i don't know. i can't really think of much to say probably.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{oh. so...}
<A>__{she hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she came from.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. i didn't mean to }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{no, i don't want to bug you if you're trying to }
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{it's okay, really.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. i have a long trip ahead of me.}
<P>__{(sits across aisle from joel)}
<D>__{how far are you going? on the train, i mean, of course.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{rockville center.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{get out! me too! what are the odds?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{the weirder part is i think actually i recognize you. i thought that earlier in the diner. that's why i was looking at you. you work at borders, right?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{ucch, really? you're kidding. god. bizarre small world, huh? yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{really? because }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{jesus, is it five years? i gotta quit right now.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{ because i go there all the time. i don't think i ever saw you before.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{well, i'm there. i hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. you have a cell phone? i need to quit right this minute. i will call in dead.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i don't have one.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i will go on the dole. like my daddy before me.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i noticed your hair. i guess it made an impression on me, that's why i was pretty sure i recognized you.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{ah, the hair.}
<P>__{(pulls a strand in front of her eyes, studies it)}
<D>__{blue, right? it's called blue ruin. the color. snappy name, huh?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i like it.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{yeah. tom waits says it in }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{exactly! tom waits. which song?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i can't remember.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. red menace, yellow fever, green revolution. that'd be a job, coming up with those names. how do you get a job like that? that's what i will do. fuck the dole.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i don't really know how }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{purple haze, pink eraser.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{you think that could possibly be a full time job? how many hair colors could there be?}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(pissy)}
<D>__{someone's got that job.}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{agent orange! i came up with that one. anyway, there are endless color possibilities and i'd be great at it.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i'm sure you would.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{my writing career! your hair written by clementine kruczynski.}
<P>__{(thought)}
<D>__{the tom waits album is rain dogs.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{you sure? that doesn't sound }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i think. anyway, i've tried all their colors. more than once. i'm getting too old for this. but it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. i apply my personality in a paste. you?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{oh, i doubt that's the case.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{sorry. i was just trying to be nice.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{yeah, i got it.}
<A>__{there's a silence.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{my name's clementine, by the way.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i'm joel.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{no jokes about my name? oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i don't know any jokes about your name.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{huckleberry hound?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i don't know what that means.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{huckleberry hound! what, are you nuts?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i'm nut nuts.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' clementine? no?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{sorry. it's a pretty name, though. it means "merciful", right?}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{yeah. although it hardly fits. i'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{see, i wouldn't think that about you.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(pissy)}
<D>__{why wouldn't you think that about me?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{oh. i don't know. i was just... i don't know. i was... you seemed nice, so }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{now i'm nice? don't you know any other adjectives? there's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{well, anyway... sorry.}
<A>__{they sit in silence for a while.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i just don't think "nice" is a particularly interesting thing to be.}
<A>__{the conductor enters the car.}
<C>__{conductor}
<D>__{tickets.}
<A>__{joel hands the conductor his ticket. the conductor punches it and hands it back.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{what is nice, anyway? i mean, besides an adjective? i guess it can be an adverb, sort of.}
<A>__{the conductor turns to clementine. she fishes in her bag.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{it doesn't reveal anything. nice is pandering. cowardly.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{and life is more interesting than that. or should be. jesus god, i hope it is... someday.}
<P>__{(to conductor)}
<D>__{i know it's here.}
<A>__{the conductor and joel watch as she gets more agitated.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{i don't need nice. i don't need myself to be it and i don't need anyone else to be it at me.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{shit. shit. i know it's here. hold on.}
<A>__{she dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts frantically through. joel sees the book she was reading in the diner. it's the play by stephen dixon.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{damn it. damn it!}
<P>__{(there it is)}
<D>__{oh. here.}
<A>__{she hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly. he punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away.}
<C>__{conductor}
<D>__{next stop southampton.}
<A>__{the conductor heads into the next car. clementine shoves stuff back into her purse. her hands are a little shaky. she pulls a airline sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket, opens it, and downs it. joel is watching all of this but pretending not to. she looks out the window for a while. the train pulls into the station. the doors open. nobody gets on. the doors close. the train pulls out.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{joel? it's joel, right?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i'm sorry i... yelled at you. was it yelling? i can't really tell. whatever, i'm a little out of sorts today.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{that's okay.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(stares out window)}
<D>__{my embarrassing admission is i really like that you're nice. right now, anyway. i can't tell from one moment to the next what i'm going to like. but right now i'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. that was nice of you.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{it's no problem. anyway, i have some stuff i need to }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{oh, okay. well, sure, i will just...}
<P>__{(stands, throws bag over shoulder)}
<D>__{take care, then.}
<C>__{joel}
<P>__{(pulling journal from briefcase)}
<D>__{probably see you at the book store.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(heading toward other end of car)}
<D>__{unless i get that hair color naming job.}
<A>__{clementine sits and stares out the window.}
<L>__{interior train later}
<A>__{there are a few more people in the car now. clementine has inched a few seats closer to joel. she watches him. his head is immersed in his journal.}
<L>__{interior train later}
<A>__{it's dark out. the train is pretty crowded. joel stares out the window. clementine sits closer still to joel, eyes him.}
<L>__{exterior train station evening}
<A>__{the doors open and joel emerges along with others. he heads to the parking lot, arrives at the car. there's a big dented scrape along the driver's side. he gets in.}
<L>__{interior car moments later}
<A>__{joel drives. he passes clementine walking. she looks cold. he considers, slows, rolls down his window.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{hi. i could give you a ride if you need.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{no, that's okay. thanks, though.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{you're sure? it's cold.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i don't want to take you out of your way.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{he pulls over. she climbs in. they drive.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{where do you live?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{you're not a stalker or anything, right?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{well, i probably wouldn't say if i were, but no.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{you can't be too careful. i've been stalked. i've been told i'm highly stalkable. i don't need that.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i'm not a stalker.}

<P>__{(beat)}

<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{wilmont. near the high school.}

<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{look, i'm very sorry i came off sort of nutso. i'm not really.}
<C>__{joel}

<D>__{yeah? i can't remember that album very well. i remember liking it. but }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{the song's 9th and hennepin. i spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin and you spill out over the side to anyone who'll listen." remember?}

<D>__{thanks. i like it, too. been here about four years. it's really cheap. my downstairs neighbor is old so she's quiet, which is great. and the landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but great, and i have a little porch in the back, which is great, because i can read there, and listen to my crickets and...}

<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{yeah. i'm not, like, a robert frost lover by any stretch. his stuff seems strictly grade school to me. but this made me cry for some reason. maybe because it is grade school. y'know?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{it's pretty.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i miss grade school. i don't know why i'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. when i went we called it elementary school. but i like grade school better. sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. i'd like to be from then. everyone wore hats. anyway, cheers!}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{cheers.}
<A>__{they click glasses. clementine giggles and takes a big gulp of her drink. joel sips. she plops down on the couch and pulls her boots off.}

<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{yeah? well, have a seat, anyway.}

<D>__{you pick it.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{you just say. i'm not really }
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{i don't know! i can't see them from here, joel! just pick something good.}
<A>__{joel studies the unfamiliar cd's. he picks up bang on a can performing brian eno's music for airports to look at. clementine reenters with her drink.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{oh, excellent choice.}
<A>__{she grabs it and sticks it in the cd player. the music is dreamy and haunting and slow. clementine falls back onto the couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{mmmmmmm. way to go, joel. you pick good.}
<A>__{joel sits down in his chair and drinks. there's a silence, which seems fine to clementine but makes joel anxious.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{well, i should probably get going.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{no, stay. just for a little while.}
<P>__{(opens her eyes, brightly)}
<D>__{refill?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{no. i }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i know a man who needs a refill.}
<A>__{she grabs joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the kitchen.}
<D>__{clementine (cont'd) (o.s.) (cont'd) god bless alcohol, is what i say. where would i be without it. oh, jesus, mary, and joseph, maybe i don't want to think about that.}
<A>__{she giggles. joel looks around the room again. there are several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher potato, a housewife potato. clementine returns with joel's drink and a refill for herself.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{drink up, young man. it'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.}
<A>__{joel looks a little alarmed.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{i'm just kidding. c'mon.}
<A>__{she sits back on the couch, closes her eyes. joel watches her, looks at her breasts. she opens her eyes, smiles drunkenly at him.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{y'know, i'm sort of psychic.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{well, i go to a psychic and she's always telling me i'm psychic. she should know. do you believe in that stuff?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{me neither. but sometimes i have premonitions, so, i don't know. maybe that's just coincidence. right? y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? y'know?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{yeah, i don't know. it's hard to know.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{exactly. exactly! that's exactly my feeling about it. it's hard to know. like, okay, but how many times do i think something and it doesn't happen? that's what you're saying, right? you forget about those times. right?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{yeah, i guess.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(dreamy beat)}
<D>__{but i think i am. i like to think i am.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{it's helpful to think there's some order to things. you're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{sorry. my life isn't that interesting. i go to work. i go home. i don't know what to say.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(considers this)}
<D>__{does that make you sad? or anxious? i'm always anxious thinking i'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? taking advantage of every possibility? just making sure that i'm not wasting one second of the little time i have.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i think about that.}
<A>__{she looks at him really hard for a long moment. joel tries to hold her gaze, but can't. he looks down at his drink. clementine starts to cry again.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{you're really nice. i'm sorry i yelled at you before about it. god, i'm an idiot.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i do have a tendency to use that word too much.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i like you. that's the thing about my psychic thing. i think that's my greatest psychic power, that i get a sense about people. my problem is i never trust it. but i get it. and with you i get that you're a really good guy.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{and, anyway, you sell yourself short. i can tell. there's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. i can tell. my goal... can i tell you my goal?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(ala paul simon)}
<D>__{what's the goal, joel?}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{my goal, joel, is to just let it flow through me? do you know what i mean? it's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think we're all taught we should be consistent. y'know? you love someone that's it. forever. you choose to do something with your life that's it, that's what you do. it's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. and my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. you know?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{yeah. i think so. it's hard to }
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{like i wanted to talk to you. i didn't need any more reason to do it. who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{you're very nice. god, i have to stop saying that. you're nervous around me, huh?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i'm nervous. you don't need to be nervous around me, though. i like you. do you think i'm repulsively fat?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{no, not at all.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i don't either. i used to. but i'm through with that. y'know, if i don't love my body, then i'm just lost. you know?}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{with all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so, i've been seeing this guy...}
<A>__{joel looks slightly crestfallen.}
<C>__{clementine }
<P>__{(off his reaction)}
<D>__{well, for the last week, anyway! he's kind of a kid. kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. who wouldn't like that? and he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. he's the one who gave me that crow photograph.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{that made me cry. but, anyway, we went up to boston, because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river. it gets frozen this time of year.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{that's scary sounding.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{exactly! i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again, so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but i was really disappointment to be there with him. y'know? and that's where psychic stuff comes in. like, it just isn't right with him. y'know?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. we like the same writers. this writer stephen dixon he turned me on to. and he's cute. it's fucked up. joel, you should come up to the charles with me sometime.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{yeah? oh, great!}
<A>__{she sits closer to him.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{i will pack a picnic a night picnic night picnics are different and }
<C>__{joel}
<P>__{(shy)}
<D>__{sounds good. but right now i should go.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you should stay.}

<D>__{i have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{joel puts on his overcoat. clementine heads to the phone table, pulls out a notepad.}
<C>__{clementine }
<D>__{i would like you to call me. would you do that? i would like that.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{she scribbles her phone number, hands it to him. he puts it in his pocket. he stands there uncomfortably for a moment, then forces himself to speak.}
<C>__{joel }
<D>__{i don't think your personality comes out of a tube. i think the hair is just... a pretty topping.}
<A>__{she tears up, swallows, and kisses him on the cheek. he's surprised and pleased and nervous.}
<C>__{joel }
<P>__{(shyly formal)}
<D>__{so, i enjoyed meeting you.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{you'll call me, right?}

<A>__{he hurries inside the building.}
<L>__{interior joel's apartment night}
<A>__{joel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the lights, crosses to look furtively out the window. it's snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam of a streetlight.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{it was snowing. voice over there are two of them. couldn't make them out. the orange glow of a cigarette.}
<A>__{joel squints to see inside the van. two dark figures talk. one sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily illuminates the interior. the figure in the driver seat rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to joel.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{the driver waved. so casual, friendly. voice over i'm like a joke to them.}
<A>__{joel pulls away from the window, his face blanched.}
<D>__{voice over i guess they figure they can act like they want. they don't have to worry about me remembering.}
<A>__{he paces, mulling things over. as he does, the scene starts to change, almost as if it is drying out.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i might be making a mistake. voice over maybe i'm making a mistake. maybe i just need to learn to live with this. first of all, i will get over it. secondly, it happened. those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. who said that? churchill? i'm not sure. but i don't care. she did it to me. i have to rid myself of this. fuck her.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{fuck you, clementine.}
<A>__{the colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague. even joel's persona and voice over seem to alter, his emotional intensity becoming diffused. joel does not seem aware of this. he stops pacing, takes a small vial from his pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm. he looks at it. it's pink. there's some illegible initials stamped on it.}

<D>__{pink.}
<P>__{(beat)}

<L>__{interior bookstore night}
<A>__{joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop. it's a jarring transition, visually and emotionally. joel is in the midst of some traumatic state of mind. he fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches clementine stack books on shelves. her hair is bright orange now.}

<D>__{i should maybe talk to you. voice over clementine. i should just maybe talk to her.}

<A>__{right before joel gets there, patrick, a skinny young man approaches clementine. joel stops, watches. the young man seems out of breath. he glances over at joel, then taps clementine on the shoulder. she turns, annoyed, sees who it is and her face lights up.}

<D>__{is there any sort of risk of brain damage?}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. nothing you'll miss.}

<A>__{joel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with clementine. there are funny little gifts, wind up toys, some potatoes dressed as women, some clothing clementine has left there, some cd's. he pulls a big clump of pages out of his loose leaf journal and dumps them in the bag. he gets some clean loose leaf paper and writes: december 15, 2004 nothing much happened today. i stayed home. naomi worked on her dissertation. the scene is fading as he continues to write.}

<D>__{yeah. i don't ever know what to say.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i can't tell you how happy i am to hear that. i mean, i don't mean i'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... i'm such a loser. every time i come to a party i tell myself i'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then i hate myself after for being such a clod.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{even then i didn't believe you entirely. i thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people? voice over but i thought, i don't know, i thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what i was feeling and that you were attracted to it.}

<D>__{so go.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i did. i walked out the door. i felt like i was a scared little kid. i thought you knew that about me. i ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. you said, "so go" with such disdain.}
