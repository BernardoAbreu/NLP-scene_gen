<L>__{exterior master epps's plantation smoke house night}
<A>__{on top of a wood pile, in the back of the smoke house epps shoves patsey. he stops, stands as if gathering his manhood, then he's all over patsey. he is rough and clumsy. it looks like something between an awkward rape and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter. patsey does not respond in any way other than to continually turn her head from epps, but otherwise remain as still as possible. if there is such a thing, she is vicious with her passive aggressiveness. epps's frustration mounts until as the mistress shaw had cautioned he crosses the line from passion to violence. he begins slapping patsey to get a response from her. when that fails, he punches her which only leads to him taking up his whip and lashing patsey mercilessly. still, she gives him nothing. beaten, patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, epps deep breathing above her. the desire for sex now having left him. epps heads from the field. patsey is left where she is.}
