<L>__{into the lake }
<A>__{making a wave that spreads out in a circle.}
<B>__{shenzhou escape pod.}
<A>__{ryan feels the cabin hit the water. she has landed safely. but she cannot celebrate because she can't stop coughing. she is asphyxiating in the thick cloud of smoke. she unstraps herself and reaches a lever at the side of the hatch. she pulls the lever.}
<B>__{on the lake.}
<A>__{with a small controlled explosion, the hatch cover is launched away from the cabin. smoke pours out through the open hatch.}
<B>__{shenzhou escape pod.}
<A>__{she begins to unstrap herself when water pours in through the open hatch. she tries to make her way out, fighting against the strong current that is gushing in, but the flow is too strong and }
<B>__{it pushes her back in.}
<A>__{she struggles to force her way through the cascade rapidly filling the cabin, but it is too strong.}
<B>__{the cabin is overflowing.}
<A>__{the water has reached ryan's chin when she manages to take one last deep breath of air before }
<B>__{water completely fills it.}
<C>__{underwater}
<A>__{the metallic capsule, which weighs almost three tons, sinks quickly into the lake. as the ropes of the parachute tense, the long fabric follows the cabin down.}
<B>__{shenzhou escape pod.}
<A>__{air trapped inside ryan's suit leaks out through the collar and small bubbles float up. ryan fights her way to the hatch, and pulling with her good arm, she swims out.}
<B>__{underwater.}
<A>__{she pushes herself away from the cabin, swimming away from the}
<D>__{pod as }
<B>__{the shenzhou hits the lake bottom.}
<A>__{a dark cloud of mud swells up around it. ryan struggles to swim up to the surface, but she can only use one arm and the wet suit is dragging her down. she strokes rapidly, but she isn't moving up. instead she's going down, and}
<B>__{her feet sink into the lake bed.}
<A>__{she looks up and sees the rays of sunlight breaking through the lake's surface are eclipsed by the parachute, which floats down toward her like a huge jellyfish about to engulf its pray. the frog crosses in front of her, effortlessly swimming on its way to the surface. small bubbles of air come out of ryan's nose as she struggles to open her suit. she takes off the bottom part of the suit.}
<D>__{above her }
<A>__{the parachute is getting closer, a net about to trap her. she struggles out of the top part of her suit. and squirming out from under it she frees herself from the heavy garments and swims up as the sinking parachute traps her foot and begins dragging her down. but with a kick she sets herself free, and she swims up, stroking with her good arm. she is completely out of breath, only the tiniest bubbles rise from her nose. she is about to lose consciousness, when she sees the frog swimming ahead of her, sliding smoothly through the water toward the rays of sunlight diffracted by the surface. ryan's eyes are closed as she floats up, her body limp. the surface is coming closer and closer. she reaches the thin boundary between water and air and she come out to the }
<B>__{surface.}
<A>__{and she takes an enormous breath.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{aaahhhhhh!}
<A>__{almost primal, like the first breath of a newborn child, it burns her lungs but reclaims life. she only has enough strength to keep her face above water. she floats, catching her breath and taking long gulps of air. she looks up at }
<D>__{the sky }
<A>__{where the clouds move, caressed by air and light. and beyond}
<D>__{them }
<A>__{outer space, but she's back on earth. she turns around, and taking a deep breath she swims, breaking through the water and harnessing every last bit of energy in her. and soon she arrives to the }
<B>__{shallow edge of the lake}
<A>__{she drags herself from the water, like the first amphibious life form crawling out of the primordial soup onto land.}
<B>__{collapses on the shore.}
<A>__{the water laps gently over her, washing in and out around her legs. she lies with her face against the muddy shore and her eyes closed, recovering her strength.}
<B>__{and she breathes. she breathes air.}
<A>__{and as her breath steadies }
<B>__{she smiles.}
<A>__{she pushes her face against the ground, enjoying the sense of weight, and }
<B>__{she opens her eyes.}
<A>__{then she looks at her surroundings, taking in the almost unbearable beauty of the planet earth. she's breathing deeply and begins to cough. it's not a cough, it's a chuckle.}
<B>__{ryan is cracking up.}
<A>__{ecstasy overcomes ryan and joyful laughter fills her body.}
<B>__{she is alive.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{she plants her palms against the ground and with an effort, she pushes herself up. she feels her weight, and manages to rise to her hands and knees like a four legged mammal. and she stands up. one foot falls heavily on the ground. it sinks into the mud and}
<D>__{then }
<B>__{another foot.}
<A>__{ryan's feet are solidly planted on the mud.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{ahhhhh!!!}
<A>__{one foot moves forward and lands on more solid ground, unstable, coping with the weight. and then the other foot follows as she begins to walk on planet earth, laughing.}
<B>__{she is punch drunk. she is free.}
