<L>__{82. interior dorothy's apartment night}
<A>__{he quickly enters the very dark apartment and shuts the door. it takes a moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness. soon he finds his way around. he decides on the closet to hide in. however before he goes in to the closet he slowly surveys the apartment as well as he can in the darkness. he goes down the hallway to the back bedroom. across the hallway he opens another door and is surprised to find an empty child's room. in the child's room he sees a small pointed hat with a propeller on top. the kind that plays music when the propeller turns. the hat is sitting silently on the bed post. he quietly closes the door. he returns to the closet. once inside, he checks out how much he can see. through the slats he has a view of half the apartment. this is where he will stay. he moves around some to relax. he takes several deep breaths. he looks at his watch. it says "10:17."}
