<D>__{when you're carrying drugs across the border, the idea is to remain calm. the way i do it is to think of something pleasant, a fun party, a moment of triumph. a sexual encounter. i actually project myself to that place. anything to keep your mind off the fact that you're going to jail for a very long time if they find the fifteen kilos of cocaine in your suitcases.}
