<L>__{exterior st. mark's place night}
<A>__{jean and benny walk along, sharing a beer in a brown paper bag. they approach a drug dealer and exchange money for dope. jean finds a discarded window frame in a pile of trash and carries it with him. they sit down on a stoop. jean rolls up a dollar bill, empties the dope onto the window, and splits it into two lines. he hands the rolled up bill to benny, who snorts the line. benny shakes his head involuntarily, making a violent face, as though the dope burned a hole in his sinus.}

<D>__{we got beat.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{for real?}
<A>__{jean takes a taste with his finger... he tastes his tongue and makes a face.. he snorts part of his line, anyway, to make sure. he frowns. they continue onwards. jean still carries the window.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{you gonna carry that around all night?}
