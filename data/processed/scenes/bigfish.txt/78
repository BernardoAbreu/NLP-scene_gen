<L>__{interior guest bedroom night}
<A>__{a portable fan quietly whirrs in the corner. turned low, the radio on the nightstand is playing a call in am sports show, just a wash of background chatter. edward lies asleep on his back. at the window, josephine quietly lowers the shade. she reaches over edward to switch off the radio. he stirs from the silence he wasn't fully asleep and sees josephine stretched over him.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(playfully lecherous)}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{hi. how are you feeling?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i was dreaming.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{what were you dreaming about?}
<A>__{he tries to recollect, but it's already gone. josephine motions, is it okay for her to sit on the bed? he nods.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i don't usually remember unless they're especially portentous. you know what that word means, portentous?}
<A>__{she shakes her head.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{means when you dream about something that's going to happen.}
<P>__{(beat, gathering)}
<D>__{like one night, i had a dream where this crow came and told me, "your aunt is going to die." i was so scared i woke up my parents. they told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. but the next morning, my aunt stacy was dead.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{that's terrible.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "your grampa is going to die." well, i ran right back to my parents. my father said, no, gramps is fine, but i could see there was trepidation. and true enough, that next morning my grampa was dead.}
<A>__{he sits up a bit in bed, his strength returning.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{for the next couple weeks, i didn't have another dream. until one night the crow came back and said, "your daddy is going to die."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, i didn't know what to do. but finally i told my father. and he said not to worry, but i could tell he was rattled. that next day, he wasn't himself, always looking around, waiting for something to drop on his head. because the crow didn't tell how it was going to happen, just those words: your daddy is going to die. well, he went into town early and was gone for a long time. and when he finally came back, he looked terrible, like he was waiting for the axe to fall all day. he said to my mother, "good god. i just had the worst day of my life."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{"you think you've had a bad day," she said. "this morning the milkman dropped dead on the porch!" josephine smiles, a half laugh, which gets him smiling too.}
<A>__{a long beat. then, deadpan...}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{because see, my mother was banging the milkman.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{no, i understand.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{he was slipping her a little extra cream.}
<A>__{she nods, a bit more of a laugh.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{he was filling her basket. he was making deliveries around back.}
<A>__{as edward continues, she can't help but laugh harder, especially as the metaphors get more vulgar.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{he was buttering her rolls. pumping her churn. splashing milk in her box.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{stop.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{they were squeezing the cheese. clanking the bottles. licking the popsicle.}
<A>__{she's starting to cry from laughing.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{cracking the eggs and making an omelet.}
<A>__{with that, he stops. she regains her composure.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{spooning the sherbet.}
<C>__{josephine}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{can i take your picture?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you don't need a picture. just look up handsome in the dictionary.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{please?}
<A>__{he rolls his eyes, why not. josephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera. we stay with edward in bed.}
<C>__{josephine }
<D>__{i have photos from the wedding to show you. there's a great one of you and my father. i had an extra print made.}
<A>__{edward grimaces, a flash of pain. around others, he's hiding how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is. he controls his breathing, trying to push through it.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{i want to see pictures of your wedding. i've never seen any.}
<A>__{she returns with her camera. edward smiles, doing a good job masking the pain.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{that's because we didn't have a wedding. your mother in law was never supposed to marry me. she was engaged to somebody else.}
<C>__{josephine}
<P>__{(loading film)}
<D>__{i never knew.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{will never told you that?}
<P>__{(she shakes her head)}
<D>__{probably just as well. he would have told it all wrong anyway. all the facts and none of the flavor.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{oh, so this is a tall tale?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{well, it's not a short one.}
<A>__{a devilish smile. pushing past edward, we settle on the whirling fan.}
