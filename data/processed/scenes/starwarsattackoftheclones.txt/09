<L>__{interior senate building, apartment evening}
<A>__{padme is in a conference with captain typho and dorme. jar jar enters the room, followed by the two jedi.}
<C>__{jar jar}
<D>__{lookie... lookie... oops!... oh, dear, i'm afraid i've forgotten myself again.}
<A>__{padme and typho rise as obi wan and anakin stop before the senator. obi wan steps forward. anakin stares at padme. she glances at him.}
<D>__{obi wan it's a great pleasure to see you again, m'lady.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{it has been far too long master kenobi. i'm so glad our paths have crossed again... but i must warn you that i think your presence here is unnecessary. obi wan i'm sure the jedi council have their reasons.}
<A>__{she moves in front of anakin}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{annie??}
<P>__{(stares)}
<D>__{my goodness you've grown.}
<A>__{they look at each other for a long moment.}
<C>__{anakin}
<P>__{(trying to be smooth)}
<D>__{so have you... grown more beautiful, i mean... and much shorter... for a senator, i mean.}
<A>__{obi wan looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. padme laughs and shakes her head.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{oh annie, you'll always be that little boy i knew on tatooine.}
<A>__{this embarrasses anakin, and he looks down. obi wan and captain typho smile.}
<D>__{obi wan our presence will be invisible, m'lady.}
<C>__{captain typho}
<D>__{i am very grateful you are here, master kenobi. the situation is more dangerous than the senator will admit.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i don't need more security, i need answers. i want to know who is trying to kill me. obi wan}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{we're here to protect you senator, not to start an investigation.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{we will find out who is trying to kill you padme, i promise you.}
<A>__{he's done it again. he bites his lip in frustration and shame. obi wan gives anakin a dirty look.}
<D>__{obi wan we are not going to exceed our mandate, my young padawan learner.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i meant in the interest of protecting her, master, of course. obi wan we are not going through this exercise again, anakin. you will pay attention to my lead.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{why? obi wan what??!!}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{why else do you think we were assigned to her, if not to find the killer? protection is a job for local security... not jedi. it's overkill, master. investigation is implied in our mandate. obi wan we will do as the council has instructed, and you will learn your place, young one.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{perhaps with merely your presence, the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed. now if you will excuse me i will retire.}
<A>__{everyone gives amidala a slight bow as she and dorme leave the room.}
<C>__{captain typho}
<D>__{well, i know i feel a lot better having you here. i will have an officer on every floor and i will be at the command centre downstairs.}
<C>__{jar jar}
<D>__{mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again, annie. deesa bad times, bombad times.}
<A>__{captain typho leaves.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{she didn't even recognise me, jar jar. i thought about her every day since we parted... and she's forgotten me completely.}
<C>__{jar jar}
<D>__{shesa happy. happier den mesa see en her in longo time. obi wan anakin, you're focusing on the negative again. be mindful of your thoughts. she was glad to see us. now lets check the security here.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{yes, my master.}
