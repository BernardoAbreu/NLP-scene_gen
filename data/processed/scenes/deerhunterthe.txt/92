<A>__{merle takes a glance at the guard in charge again. the guard in charge is still eyeing him with caution. merle places the revolver to his temple... and clicks into an empty chamber.}
<C>__{merle }
<D>__{see! nothing to it.}
<A>__{he pushes the gun across to nick. then he stabs his finger at him, screaming again, as if in a fit of rage.}
<C>__{merle }
<D>__{you got an empty chamber and it's in your mind! just put that empty chamber in the gun!}
<A>__{nick looks down at the revolver and picks it up. he stares at merle for a moment. then he spins the cylinder, cocks the hammer, puts it to his head... and clicks into an empty chamber. the guards let out expressions of disbelief. those betting on nick begin taunting those betting on merle. merle sits motionless, as if stunned, as if utterly defeated, his brow furrowed in a mighty frown. nick pushes the revolver across the table. his face is twitching but he gives the gesture a certain flair, as if throwing back a challenge. merle stares at the revolver stares at it with an expression of utter gloom. then he reaches out, takes the revolver in his hand and pulls it toward him, as if he no longer possessed the strength to pick it up.}

<C>__{merle }
<D>__{who here is for merle...?}
<A>__{there is absolute silence now except for the drumming of the rain. it is as if the war had disappeared, vanished. the guards stand motionless, hardly breathing, so captivated by merle's performance that they suddenly resemble little children.}
<C>__{merle }
<D>__{who... here... is for merle...?}
<A>__{merle begins his chant again. his voice is low, very dramatic, and the guard in charge joins right in.}

<D>__{merle is mighty! ha! merle is strong! ha! merle is magic ha!}
<A>__{merle snaps the revolver level in his hand and blasts the guard in charge, hitting him full in the face. at the same time nick throws himself into the guard who is standing behind him, spins and slams the guard's ak 47 into his chin. two more shots blast out from merle's .45 and we see two guards crash over the kitchen table. nick now opens up with ak 47, and as merle backs off beside him, also with an ak 47, they gun the remaining guards to the floor. it is over in an instant. the bodies lie in a bloody, tangled mess under a pathetic paper lantern. the rain drones on uninterrupted, undiminished, eternal...}
