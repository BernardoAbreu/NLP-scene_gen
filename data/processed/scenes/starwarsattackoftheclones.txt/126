<L>__{interior conference room (geonosis) day}
<A>__{count dooku sits at a large conference table with padme on the far side. anakin stands behind her with four geonosians guards standing behind him. jango fett stands behind count dooku, and six geonosian guards stand behind him.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{you are holding a jedi knight, obi wan kenobi. i am formally requesting you turn him over to me, now.}
<C>__{dooku}
<D>__{he has been convicted of espionage, senator, and will be executed. in just a few hours, i believe.}
<A>__{count dooku smiles.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{he is an officer of the republic. you can't do that.}
<C>__{dooku}
<D>__{we don't recognise the republic here, senator. but if naboo were to join our alliance, i could easily hear your plea for clemency.}
<A>__{anakin grabs his lightsaber but doesn't turn it on.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{and if i don't join your rebellion, i assume this jedi with me will also die?}
<C>__{dooku}
<D>__{i don't wish to make you to join our cause against your will, senator, but you are a rational, honest representative of your people and i assume you want to do what's in their best interest. aren't you fed up with the corruption, the bureaucrats, the hypocrisy of it all?.. aren't you? be honest, senator.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{the ideals are still alive, count, even if the institution is failing.}
<C>__{dooku}
<D>__{you believe in the same ideals we believe in! the same ideals we are striving to make prominent.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{if what you say is true, you should stay in the republic and help chancellor palpatine put things right.}
<C>__{dooku}
<D>__{the chancellor means well, m'lady but he is incompetent. he has promised to cut the bureaucracy, but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever, no? senator, the republic cannot be fixed. it is time to start over. the democratic process in the republic is a sham, a shell game played on the voters. it will not be long before the cult of greed, called the republic, will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i cannot believe that. i will not forsake all i have honoured and worked for and betray the republic. i know of your treaties with the trade federation, the commerce guilds, and the others, count. what is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business... it's business becoming government!}
<C>__{dooku}
<D>__{are you willing to betray your jedi friends? without your co operation i can do nothing to stop their execution.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{what is to happen to me? am i to be executed also?}
<C>__{dooku}
<D>__{i wouldn't think of such an offence. but, there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise, m'lady. it has nothing to do with politics, i'm afraid. it's purely personal, and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. i'm sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions. i'm sorry but if you are not going to co operate, i must turn you over to the geonosians for justice. i've done all i can for you.}
<A>__{jango fett moves over to anakin.}
<C>__{jango fett}
<D>__{i will take that weapon.}
<A>__{anakin hesitates.}
<C>__{dooku}
<D>__{you may cause a lot of bloodshed, my young jedi, but you will not escape.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{anakin...}
<A>__{anakin hands his lightsaber over to jango fett.}
