<L>__{interior taxicab city streets early morning}
<A>__{a fiftyish woman cabbie with white hair and a southern twang is at the wheel of the cab.}
<D>__{woman cabble what time's your flight, friends?}
<A>__{in the back seat, cole, in the blonde wig and moustache, looks to his companion, the sexy babe in sun glasses and heavy make up, railly.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{nine thirty}
<C>__{woman cabbie}
<D>__{might be tight.}
<C>__{railly}
<P>__{(startled, checks her watch)}
<D>__{tight? my watch says 7:30.}
<C>__{woman cabbie}
<D>__{on your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your army of the twelve monkeys factor.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{what? what did you say?}
<C>__{woman cabbie}
<D>__{twelve monkeys, honey. guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.}
<A>__{cole and railly exchange a quick look.}
<C>__{woman cabbie}
<D>__{bunch a weirdoes let all the animals outta the zoo last night. then they locked up this big shot scientist in one of the cages. scientist's own kid was one a the ones did it!}
<A>__{railly and cole stare at the cabbie, stunned.}
<D>__{woman cabble now they got animals all over the place. buncha zebras shut down the thruway 'bout an hour ago and some kinda thing called an "e mu" it's got traffic blocked for miles over on 22.}
<A>__{flabbergasted, railly's eyes suddenly fill with hope.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{that's what they were up to! freeing animals!}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{on the walls they meant the animals when they said, "we did it."}
<C>__{woman cabbie}
<D>__{you can hear it on the radio all the stations...}
<A>__{as the woman caebie switches on the radio, ra:lly points and cole follows her look. cole's pov: two cheetahs, sleek and magnificent against the cityscape, streaking past the cab at ninety mph!}
<P>__{announcer radio (o.s.)}
<D>__{in the meantime, numerous animal rights activists have joined the chorus condemning what they're calling the "loose canon" activities of jeffrey mason and his army of the twelve monkeys.}
<P>__{rights activist radio (o.s.)}
<D>__{can these fools seriously believe that releasing a captive animal into an urban environment is being compassionate to the animal? it's mindlessly cruel, almost as indefensible as holding the animal in captivity in the first place.}
<A>__{railly and cole are watching flamingos cross the sky against a backdrop of skyscrapers in silhouette.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{maybe it's going to be okay.}
