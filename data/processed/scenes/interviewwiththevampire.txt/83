<L>__{exterior carriage night}
<A>__{louis whipping the horses. claudia beside him. lestat's skeleton in the back, with the bodies of the two dead youths.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{in europe, louis. we shall meet our own kind. find the one who made him. learn what it means.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{and suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! and we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.}
<A>__{the carriage pulls up by a swamp. mist everywhere. overhanging creepers.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{and if we find the one who made him? do we tell him we destroyed his own creation? the vampire lestat?}
<A>__{louis drags out the bodies of the boys. he slides them into the waters of the swamp. we see ripples in the water and the churning of alligators, as they attack the corpses. louis takes lestat's skeleton in his arms. he slides it into the waters. the alligators speed towards it.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{he belongs with those reptiles, louis. he deserved to die.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{then maybe so do we. every night of our lives. he was my brother. my maker. he gave me this life, whatever it is.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i did it for us, louis. so we could be free.}
<A>__{he stands there, saying nothing.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{louis, look at me.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{i can't. go away from me.}
<A>__{claudia is shocked to her core. she steps back. louis stares at the rippling waters. gradually the movement of alligators stops. then he hears a sound he hasn't heard in years. soft, choking. he turns, sees claudia sitting by a cypress tree, like a little girl for the first time in years. she is weeping copiously.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{claudia you're crying }
<A>__{we see her face, tears of blood running down it. she is heartbroken, lost.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you never talked to me like that in all these years.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{and you never cried }
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i can't bear it when you do i would die rather than lose you louis. i would die the way he died.}
<A>__{louis gathers her in his arms.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{hush, claudia, hush now my dear }
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{tell me you don't hate me louis. i did it for you }
<A>__{louis walks her towards the carriage.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i love you claudia. always. and we are free now, claudia. no lestat. just the two of us, beginning the great adventure of our lives.}
<A>__{he lifts her into the carriage and drives off, leaving the silent waters of the swamp.}
