<D>__{ahhhhh.}
<P>__{(stunned and worried)}
<D>__{i never made that sound over a man before..}
<A>__{flor shudders at her own sappiness as john opens the passenger door for her...very much into his own torture he nonetheless grabs her arm and guides her up and in..she catches and appreciates his automatic gracious manners while he is clearly fucked up...she is impatient with his solicitousness almost slapping his hands away as he makes sure her skirt doesn't get crushed in the door..the frustration roiling in her.}
