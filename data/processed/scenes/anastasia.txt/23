<D>__{dmitri? there must be a million dmitris. . .}
<B>__{follow anya}
<A>__{as she wades into the crowded street. meetoo getting tangled in the legs of waiting soviets. anya stops suddenly. she sniffs the air. her eyes widen as she recognizes the stench that is floating through the air. she spins around and sees serebreakov}
<B>__{directly across the street.}
<A>__{serebreakov is on a mission to find anya. he turns in her direction just as a bus passes. anya is gone. we now see anya clinging to the side of the bus as it drives down the street. meetoo looks, his face dropping he knows he'll never catch up to her now. then he sees the bus hit a huge pothole and anya is knocked off into the mud. happily, meetoo trots off in her direction. anya approaches two peasants who are waiting in line in front of a cafe.}
<C>__{peasant 9}

<D>__{i know nothing!}
<C>__{peasant 10}
<D>__{nothing! peasants 9 & 10}
<P>__{(whispering simultaneously)}
<D>__{try the tavern library.}
<A>__{they begin to bicker back and forth in forced whispers as to wether dmitri is at the tavern or the library. exasperated, anya walks away. they call after her.}
<D>__{peasants9& 10 but we didn't tell you!}
<A>__{anya rolls her eyes in frustration. she doesn't see meetoo at her feet.}
<C>__{anya}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{i wish they'd all stop telling me they didn't tell me!}
<A>__{meetoo gives a "retu" of agreement. anya looks down and sees him.}
<C>__{anya }
<D>__{what are you doing. . .}
<A>__{just then, she catches another whiff of something foul in the air. anya duck quickly into a doorway and loses meetoo. anya peeks out. a garbage wagon full of dead fish and rotten food passes anya. she sighs with relief, it wasn't serebreakov it just smelled like him. anya steps out of the doorway and approaches a street artist sketching a large peasant woman as her tiny husband looks over his shoulder.}
<C>__{tiny husband}
<P>__{(to artist)}
<D>__{could you get rid of her moustache?}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{excuse me i'm looking for a man named dmitri. . .}
