<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{castle gates dawn opening. the police inspector enters the main courtyard. behind him come the two secondary policemen. behind them, obscurely, a few more.}
<B>__{castle courtyard}
<A>__{he and his men pause, reacting ... ... as the few wretched survivors of the castle prison stagger out of the shadows to greet them.}
<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{embankment morning on the old town side of the river. foggy.}

<A>__{walks slowly, tiredly. he looks up at the sky, but the sky is a silver shield against anyone who looks for help from it.}
<B>__{further on}
<A>__{kafka stops. turns. did he hear something other than the wind and the water?}
<B>__{further on}
<A>__{he passes through a small park, approaching a gate on the other side of it. leaves rustling. mist swirling around him. he opens the gate and boo!}
<B>__{gabriela}
<A>__{standing there, half in shadow, in profile. her glorious profile.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{gabriela! you did get away.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{i knew you walked this way to work. i wanted to find you before they did.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{ i've just come from the castle. it's over.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<P>__{(her eye glancing far away)}
<D>__{over? it's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.}
<A>__{kafka is beginning to sense something quite wrong with her.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{gabriela ...?}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{should i tell you why i joined our late lamented nihilists? why i became a murderer? because murder ... is bliss.}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{it's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate evil once you've adopted its procedure.}
<A>__{kafka just watches her ... the breeze sings in the air.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{have you ever watched a person deteriorate? day by day. i don't mean in a spiritual sense.}
<A>__{kafka doesn't answer. she turns fully to him. the other side of her beautiful face is ... fungus. alive. seething. frothing. bubbling. kafka backs away a couple of steps.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{only two steps back? even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i i found your jailer.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{this is the result of their elixir of youth. they were to come and check on it during the night. i contrived to miss the appointment.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{they're dead now. we can get help.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{i know how they reward failure. if they saw this i'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon with all the others.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{there's a new potion he said it was perfected.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{i know there is. and you're what i have to bargain with. for now you're the last one in their way.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i told you, they're dead . it's finished.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{why should i believe a man who never believed me? they're absolutely right, you know guilt should never be doubted. it's easier that way.}
<A>__{kafka starts to back away some more. gabriela starts to follow him.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{i think you've just escaped for the moment. just as i did. as eduard did. as they let us do. but only for the moment.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{no not this time.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{i know better than you what people will say when they have to. when they brought me in for questioning i informed on my friends the very first day.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{ listen to me }
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{i do. always. you understand the world better than any of us, kafka. and what it's becoming.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i've always held you in the highest regard.}
<A>__{and suddenly she's slashed a knife across kafka's chest. he shouts in pain, staggering backwards. she comes after him.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{ gabriela!}
<A>__{she comes after him, blade glistening. kafka does his best to run.}
<B>__{the bridge}
<A>__{kafka giddily staggers forward, one arm wrapped around his bleeding chest, gabriela close behind him. too close for him to get away. he turns to face her as he reaches the bridge and as she comes upon him again with the knife, raising his arm to block the thrust and hold her wrist back. she's strong, though, made more so by her madness. she forces him down to the ground, straddling him, the knife pushing closer. kafka gasps in pain, finally succumbs, no longer able to hold his hand up in defense, simply shutting his eyes with a terrible sigh to await the fatal stab. it doesn't come. almost. but not quite. gabriela's arm pauses, shaking in the cool, cloudy air, her sleeve trembling in the breeze off the river, the sharp blade, inches from kafka's throat, flashing in the new day's light. gabriela stares away over the river, the destroyed half of her face in shadow again, the other more strikingly beautiful than ever. as kafka watches, passive, she gets off him and slowly walks to the wall of the bridge, letting the knife drop from her hand along the way. kafka manages to lift himself to his knees, clutching his wound. he looks up. gabriela in one graceful movement climbs over the wall and throws herself into the river. kafka lowers his head.}
