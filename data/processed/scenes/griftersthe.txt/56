<L>__{exterior hotel durando day}
<A>__{a tall expensive hotel on the coast north of san diego. camera pans with the chrysler pulling in and stopping at the entrance, then pans up the balconied facade.}
<L>__{interior hotel suite day}
<A>__{living room of a high floor suite. camera faces across the room to the balcony and the view of the ocean. entrance door to one side. a supermarket shopping bag is on the coffee table. two thugs sit on the sofa, watching tv. the door opens and lilly enters, followed by bobo. the thugs immediately rise and switch off the tv.}
<C>__{bobo}
<P>__{(to the thugs)}
<D>__{take a walk.}
<A>__{the thugs leave the room as lilly crosses to stand between us and the view, followed by bobo, neither looking out. lilly turns to bobo, who abruptly punches her hard in the stomach. she falls to the floor. another angle as bobo steps across her and goes over to close the drapes over the view. lilly sits up, watching him, waiting obediently. bobo looks at her.}
<C>__{bobo }
<D>__{get me a bath towel.}
<A>__{she gets up, hurting, and hurries to the bathroom. bobo sits on the sofa, crosses his ankles on the coffee table next to the supermarket bag. he takes out and lights a cigar. lilly comes back with a large white bath towel.}
<C>__{bobo }
<D>__{you ever hear about the oranges?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{you mean, the insurance frammis?}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{tell me about the oranges, lilly.}
<A>__{he kicks over the supermarket bag. oranges roll on the floor.}
<C>__{bobo }
<D>__{while you put those in the towel.}
<A>__{lilly's very scared. she drops to her knees, spreads the towel, crawls around gathering oranges while she talks.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{you hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. it's for working scams against insurance companies.}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{and if you do it wrong?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{it can louse up your insides. you can get puh, puh, puh...}
<C>__{bobo}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{what's that, lilly?}
<A>__{lilly pauses, bent over, tightly holding an orange.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{permanent damage.}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{you'll never shit right again.}
<A>__{he gets to his feet, leaving his cigar in an ashtray.}
<C>__{bobo }
<P>__{(hard, impatient)}
<D>__{bring me the towel.}
<A>__{fumbling slightly, she folds the towel edges together to make a bag, then stands, brings the towel to bobo. he makes a production out of getting his grip on the edges just right. she stands as limp as she can, just wanting to get through this. he looks at her without expression, rears back with the towel, swings it forward, lets it drop open. oranges roll on the floor. lilly stares, wide eyed, recognizing reprieve. bobo tosses the towel behind him onto the sofa, then gestures contemptuously for her to pick up the oranges again. two shot, closer, as lilly turns, bending toward the oranges, and bobo picks up his cigar, then lifts a foot and kicks her flatfooted, hard, in the back. she sprawls on the floor. he follows and drops to his knees on her back. an angle close on lilly on the floor, bobo's knees grinding back and forth into her back. an angle on bobo, grimacing as he bears down, pressing his weight onto her back. he leans forward, left hand bracing himself on the floor beside her head as he reaches down with the cigar held in his right hand and presses the ember against the back of her splayed out right hand. ecu, lilly, clenching her teeth, tears squeezing from her eyes, simply bearing it. an angle on bobo, catching a bad smell, looking back down behind himself at lilly's body. this is the result he wanted, but it disgusts him. he straightens up, still kneeling on her, puts the cigar in his mouth, doesn't like its taste, removes it, braces his left hand against her back while he lifts off her, getting back up onto his feet. wide shot, bobo stepping over her, expression repulsed.}
<C>__{bobo }
<D>__{go clean yourself up.}
<A>__{he puts the cigar back in the ashtray as she rises, cradling her burnt hand. not looking toward bobo, hobbling with knees together, she starts from the room.}
<C>__{bobo }
<D>__{the raincoat's on the bed.}
<A>__{she leaves. he opens the drapes, then picks up an orange from the floor and steps out onto the balcony.}
