<A>__{close on a bong. pull out to reveal ted, who inhales, his snout inside the tube. ted sits on the sofa, and for the first time, we see ted in his present day form: he is ratty, patched up, and worn looking. he has a couple stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's evidence of some half assed sewing. it's obvious he's been around for three decades. he and john, who sits next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them. john, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too worn red sox t shirt he wears. he eats directly from a box of fruity pebbles. reaching in for a last handful, he finds the box almost empty. he raises it to empty the remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours fruity pebbles all over his face. it doesn't faze him much, though, as he brushes them off. it's quite obvious that this is a guy who has never really given up his childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear. ted passes the bong to john.}
