<L>__{interior grant bathroom day}
<A>__{grant is holding up his shirt, and looking at his torso. the wound on his side is blackened and gangrenous, and is starting to puff up into a veiny little spout. a fuzzy bluish moss is growing in the crevices around the spout. a pus oozes out. grant looks concerned. he squirts some neosporin onto his fingers. he massages it slowly into the wound.}
<L>__{interior grant kitchen moments later}
<A>__{grant opens the refrigerator door and rummages around inside. he pulls out some bread. some cheese. he opens the meat drawer. it's replete with cold cuts. he pulls out some oscar mayer baloney. turkey. pastrami and salami. he grabs every type of meat there is.}
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{grant assembles a sandwich at the table. two pieces of bread and some cheese. he starts putting the meat on. but he can't stop, piling more and more on until he has a little sandwich tower. he looks at it. something seems off about it. he removes the cheese. better. and then the bread. even better. he stares at what is now simply a tower of cold cuts.}

<D>__{meat.}
<A>__{after contemplating it for a moment, grant stands and carries off the pile of meat.}
