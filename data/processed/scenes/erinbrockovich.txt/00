<A>__{palms sway ... the sun washes everything in yellow ... cars motor down either side of the landscaped median ... the calls of mockingbirds mingle with the blip blip of car alarms. on the sidewalk, a skateboard ca lunks down the sidewalk, past the foot traffic of southern californians: flip flops, doc marten's, rollerblades, nikes ... then, in the middle of this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of impossibly high spike heeled pumps struts out of a shop. so high it hurts to look at them. as the shoes leave frame, we tilt up and see they're leaving a 99 cent store. as the pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are connected to a pair of impossibly long, shapely legs. eveready legs they just keep going and going. they saunter past two businessmen on a lunch break. the men pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful woman. in fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes rest on her a microsecond longer than usual. two skateboarders note the stretchy micro mini skimming the tops of her thighs. a mailman spots the big, dark sunglasses tucked into a mountain of big, blond hair. a pre teen girl glimpses the plunging neckline of the tight, bright red midriff baring bustier. it isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is so goggle eyed. eye catching is an understatement. all those folks who say barbie's proportions are unrealistic have obviously never met erin brockovich.}
