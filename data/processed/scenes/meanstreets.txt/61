<L>__{interior luncheonette area day}
<A>__{charlie is seated at a table. the waitress, marie, approaches and gives him his cup of coffee... the following scene is reminiscent of a television commercial.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{marie, are there columbian coffee beans in this coffee?}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{i dunno.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{just a second. let me taste it.}
<A>__{he pauses to sip the coffee, then shakes his head.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yes, i'd say there are some columbian coffee beans in this coffee, but only about 39%.}
<A>__{marie is disinterested. charlie continues.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you see. you probably don't notice this marie, but colombian coffee beans are rich coffee beans. bursting with that good, deep coffee flavor. picked when they are ripe to the point of perfection. the beans of course, are protected by the tall south american guama trees.}
<A>__{marie chews her gum for a moment and leaves the table. charlie's monologue continues and gradually he falls back into his confession. as he talks, the camera picks up details of the cafe and the people in it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{then the bean pickers come down and pick each bean by hand. bean by bean, all heavy with flavor. and they load them into boxes, one box at a time, box by box.}
<A>__{from time to time charlie is casually glancing at marie who is busy with her work. black & white & color the images now move out of the cafe and the camera reveals aspects of the neighborhood live action and stills: stores, people, streets, buildings, in short; a concise vision of the neighborhood. all this is intercut with charlie mentally stripping marie's clothes off with his eyes.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{like, looking at my uncle back there. one way is the obvious; ...man outside the law. on the other hand, instead of a breakdown of order there is a creation of order and instead of the breakdown of law, there is the creation of law...in this society which needs new law because 'what's a crowbar compared to a share of stock. what's the robbing of a bank compared to the founding of one and what's the murder of a man to the gainful employment of that man.' 'do not think that i have come to destroy the law or the prophets. i have not come to destroy but to fulfill.' ...amen.}
<A>__{the image culminate in aerial shots of downtown new york city. (stock footage) charlie now sees marie totally naked as she serves the customers.}
