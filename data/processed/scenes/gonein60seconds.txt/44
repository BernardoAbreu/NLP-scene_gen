<D>__{sixteen. but my birthday's in seven months ...}
<A>__{memphis shakes his head... sighs ...}
<C>__{donny astricky}

<D>__{one night? are you nuts?}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you got maybe a better plan?}

<C>__{donny astricky}
<D>__{there's no one left ...}
<C>__{otto}
<D>__{we've got several italian cars on the list. always tricky, always timeconsuming. so we're gonna need a specialist ...}
<A>__{memphis looks at him. because that's what he was afraid of.}
<C>__{mirror man}
<P>__{(to otto)}
<D>__{you know of one ?}
<C>__{memphis}
