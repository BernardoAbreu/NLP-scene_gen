<L>__{exterior moores house night}
<A>__{headlights come over the rise. the truck appears, rumbling down toward the house. the world is isolated and still.}
<B>__{in the truck cab}
<A>__{harry stops and cuts the engine, leaving the headlights on. silence now, save for the trilling of crickets.}
<B>__{in the stakebed}
<A>__{paul and brutal both look terrified now that they're actually here. an urgent whisper:}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{we can still turn back.}
<A>__{paul hesitates, wanting to do just that, but:}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{boss, look. someone's up.}
<A>__{lights are coming on inside the house. coffey rises and steps down from the truck, pulling paul along. brutal follows them.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{this is a mistake. christ, paul, what were we thinking?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{too late now. harry, keep john here until we call you.}
<A>__{paul and brutal walk to the front door as the lights inside the house keep clicking on. the last one finally comes on over the stoop, the front door opens a crack...and the twin barrels of a shotgun poke out into the night.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{who the hell goes there at two thirty in the goddamn morning?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hal, it's us! it's paul and brutal it's us!}
<A>__{the door swings wider, revealing hal's face gaunt and haggard in the yellow porch light, stunned to see them:}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{paul, what are you doing here at this hour? jesus, it's not a lockdown, is it? or a riot?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hal, god's sakes, take your finger off the trigger...}
<A>__{hal doesn't, aiming past them at the truck in the yard.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{are you hostages? who's out there? who's by that truck?}
<A>__{coffey steps into the glare of headlights with harry tugging on his arm, trying to hold him back. hal cocks both hammers.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{john coffey! halt! halt right there or i shoot!}
<A>__{his aim wavers as a woman's voice comes from upstairs:}
<C>__{melinda }
<D>__{hal? who are you talking to, you fucking cocksucker?}
<A>__{a frozen moment. hal mortified. paul gives him a look is that melinda? hal's shotgun shifts back to coffey but paul steps in front of the muzzle.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no one's hurt. we're here to help.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{help what? i don't understand. is this a prison break?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i can't explain what it is. you just have to trust me.}
<A>__{coffey comes up the steps, brushes paul aside, stops before the warden. hal blinks, his thoughts suddenly fuzzy it's that benign hypnotic effect coffey has.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{what do you...want?}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{hal! make them go away! no salesmen in the middle of the night! no fuller brushes! no french knickers with come in the crotch! tell them to take a flying fuck in a rolling d...d...}
<A>__{we hear the sound of glass breaking, then she begins to sob.}
<C>__{coffey}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{just to help. just to help, boss, that's all.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{you can't. no one can.}
<A>__{coffey pulls the shotgun gently from hal's grasp, hands it to paul. coffey moves past hal into the house...}
