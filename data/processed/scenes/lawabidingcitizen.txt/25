<L>__{interior viewing room night}
<A>__{nick and his colleagues are among several dozen witnesses seated in chairs. they watch as warden iger faces rupert.}
<C>__{warden iger}
<D>__{rupert ames. do you have anything to say?}
<A>__{rupert doesn't have much of an iq and he's scared shitless, but he does his best:}
<C>__{rupert}
<D>__{i'm here. clarence darby ain't. and that ain't right. 'cause that man is evil, ain't no other way to say it. all them things he done, and him turn witness against me for it.}
<A>__{he pauses, trying to untangle his thoughts.}
<C>__{rupert}
<D>__{i did wrong too. i guess i will pay up. but it was always him sayin' jump and how high, and i just went along. now he's killin' me and he got you people to do it. and that's a shame. a goddamn shame. and...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{...and i guess that's all.}
<A>__{nick trades a look with sarah. cantrell is stoic. warden iger nods to two guards manning the lethal injection machine, on which eight oversized glass cylinders in a vertical row are the main feature, filled with various clear liquids. there are two switches one a dummy, the other live (no way to know which is which). the guards power up the machine. lights activate on the board. each man grabs a switch, waits. nick watches the wall clock. it hits 7 o'clock. the warden nods and the guards flick their switches, quickly leaving the room. the warden follows them out, closes the door. we hear the pumps quietly activate. rupert is taking shallow breaths, terrified...then lays back to wait. plunger one slowly descends, emptying its contents into the i.v. lines... rupert sags as the fast acting barbiturate spreads through his veins...his breathing slows...his head drops back... he loses consciousness... plunger two depresses, sending the second vial of liquid into the i.v. lines with a quiet whir of pumps... plunger three activates...then plunger four...the row of cylinders emptying in sequence... rupert lies unconscious, just drifting away... he suddenly comes to. he draws in a long, shaky breath. it catches in his throat. his eyes go wide. his entire body starts to clench against some increasing pain. nick is surprised, uncertain. betsy starts growling softly at cantrell's side. her head comes up, hackles rising. nick glances to the dog...then to iger, sees the stunned look on the warden's face. something is definitely wrong. the pumps keep whirring, the plungers keep descending... rupert he throws his head back, mouth wide...}
<C>__{rupert}
<D>__{ah...ah...ah!}
<A>__{the witnesses go tense, confused what the hell?}
<C>__{rupert}
<D>__{ah ah jesus, don't that hurt!}
<A>__{rupert looks down at his arms, his expression turning to sheer horror, because: the veins are turning angry red, then blackening, as the liquids course through them...}
<C>__{rupert}
<D>__{oh fuck, oh fuck, that huuuurts!}
<A>__{those are last coherent words he speaks. from then on, he's just shrieking and bouncing against his straps, because: his veins are starting to smoke. noxious and foul. the flesh starts giving away, blood eating though skin like acid. shock sweeps the onlookers:}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{oh, jesus.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{what's going on? nick?}
<A>__{people are on their feet. horror and incomprehension.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{nick, goddamn it, what?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't know!}
<A>__{rupert is fast becoming a horror: it's going down his arms and legs, up his neck, infusing his ears a nauseating discoloration courses through his body, using his veins as a road map, going from red to yellow to black like bruises birthing spontaneously before our eyes... people in the room scream, turning away. nick pushes his way to the viewing glass, shouting at the techs:}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what the fuck's going on? do something!}
<A>__{the techs dash into the chamber but are instantly gagging and choking on the toxic fumes billowing from rupert. they retreat coughing, pulling the door shut again. rupert's screams spew forth toxic fumes...breath blows smoke from his nostrils...eyes liquefy...he's arching against his restraints so hard that bones begin snapping, blood spewing and smoking through his skin... all nick can do is stand at the glass in horror as whatever is happening runs its course and the victim collapses in a cloudy, toxic haze...}
