<A>__{bloom walks up the stone alley to his apartment, a bag of groceries in hand. he spots the white car parked out front. loud shouting in italian grows louder, until penelope and the grandmother burst out the front door. berating each other with italian curses and hand gestures. penelope sees bloom, and freezes.}

<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{the grandmother keeps up her barrage as she takes the groceries from bloom, but as soon as she's behind penelope's back she gives bloom a wink, points to her and gives a thumbs up of approval.}
