<L>__{interior house morning}
<A>__{the house is eerily silent. three things lay on the dining table. a shoulder bag filled with clothes. a carrying bag with personals. and a set of maps. maurice checks the locks on all windows... he places all the food in the refrigerator into a trash bag... he pulls out a drawer and loosens a side panel, a wad of money flops out. maurice pockets the bills... maurice walks through the hall with a portable cage. he stops before claude's hanging cage... no movement, no chirping. maurice stares emotionally for a moment before reaching in and carefully removing claude's lifeless body from the bottom of the cage. maurice looks down at the lost pet in his hands.}
