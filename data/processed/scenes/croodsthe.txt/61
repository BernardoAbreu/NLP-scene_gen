<A>__{grug uses a log to wipe tar all over a giant rib cage. grug runs out of the cave and into a nearby field and startles a pack of nesting piranha owls. he turns back to the macawnivore. the meat eating birds begin to chase grug.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{run!}
<A>__{grug leaps onto the macawnivore's back as the birds move in closer. the ground begins to break up violently as lakes empty themselves and entire forests turn sideways. the macawnivore rushes into a giant rib cage that grug has coated with tar. the piranha owls hit the rib cage and stick to it. as they fight to free themselves, the rib cage lifts off the ground. grug takes a giant tree branch, ignites it, and uses it as a rudder, scaring the piranha owls and prompting them to fly in one coherent direction.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{as the cage flies, above the fiery landscape, grug sees douglas, sitting forlornly with the shell still in his mouth.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{douglas?}
<A>__{grug doesn't even debate it, he runs back for the little monstrosity.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{hey, i know that guy.}
<A>__{grug jumps out of the cage and rushes over to grab the gerbils. then grug notices a familiar liyote hiding under a nearby rock. he grabs the liyote. grug sees the trip gerbils stranded as well. grug twirls the trip gerbils around his neck like a scarf.}

<D>__{get up!}
<A>__{a roar builds behind grug the pyroclastic flow is speeding closer. grug catches up to the lumbering blimp cage. he pushes it to go faster.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{hold on.}
<A>__{the pyroclastic cloud blasts up the narrow passage. finally, with grug's strength, the cage clears the edge of the cliff. the cloud hits them all, swallowing the cage like a speck.}
