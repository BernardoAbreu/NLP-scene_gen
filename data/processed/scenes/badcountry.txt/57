<A>__{jesse sleeps. hand under the pillow. when there's a sound... his eyes snap open to discover the silhouettes of six men, rushing into his cell... a loaded sock swings out from jesse's pillow, slams man #1 in the jaw with a crack!! on his feet, jesse whips the sock around and whacks man #2's head against the concrete wall. he slumps down unconscious. a blunt object is rammed into jesse's sternum. another shot bangs his neck. the sock drops and a padlock clatters out. with a final burst of energy, jesse turns, screams and rushes man #3. man #3 slams into the cell bars. clang!! lights out. the remaining three men attack. a series of blows rain down and jesse sinks into their grip. hall lights bump on: now we see, these "men" are guards. more guards pour in, led by murphy. they yank jesse from his cell and take him down the tier. guards toss the cell in a thorough search. mattress overturns. shelves crash.}
