<A>__{darth vader's star destroyer, larger and more awesome than the five imperial star destroyers that surround it, sits in the vastness of space. the six huge ships are surrounded by a convoy of smaller spacecraft. tie fighters dart to and fro.}

<A>__{controllers working the vast complex of electronic controls hear ominous approaching footsteps and look up from their controls. the squat, evil looking admiral ozzel and the young, powerfully built general veers, who have been conferring near the front, also feel the approaching presence and turn toward it. darth vader, lord of the sith, enters like a chill wind. as vader moves across the wide bridge, captain piett hurries up to ozzel.}

<C>__{ozzel}
<D>__{yes, captain}
<C>__{piett}
<D>__{i think we've got something, sir. the report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had.}

<D>__{my lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. it could be smugglers, it could be...}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{that is the system. and i'm sure skywalker is with them. set your course for the hoth system. general veers, prepare you men.}
