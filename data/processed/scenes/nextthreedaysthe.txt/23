<L>__{interior county jail entry hall day}
<A>__{ john waits in a long line, mostly women. he glances over at the pleasant and colorful play area in the corner and sees children playing. luke plays by himself. john puts his key ring in a plastic container. the guard takes it and puts the keys with other visitors' belongings. john guides his son toward the metal detector. luke walks through and the buzzer goes off. john instinctively moves forward to help. a guard stops him with a hand on his chest. on the other side of the metal detector another guard runs a wand over luke, pulls something from his pocket, looks at it curiously.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's a toy!}
<A>__{the guard runs the wand over the child again; no screech. the guard waves john through. no beep. john kneels and pulls on luke's jacket.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{don't worry. we'll get it back.}
