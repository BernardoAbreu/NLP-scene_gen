<L>__{interior elevator day}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{could somebody hit one? thanks.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(to him)}
<D>__{"talk about it in group." is that the answer to everything around here?}
<A>__{the doors close. everyone huddles in the compact space silently, politely. the elevator heaves into movement. it hums as it whisks down the shaft. the overhead fluorescent light in the car is weak. it flickers off and on momentarily.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{nobody ever said it would be easy. and it works for a lot of people.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{it's not working for ralph... or his chest.}
<P>__{(pleading tone)}
<D>__{can't you at least transfer me... get me in a group of people with problems a little more like mine }
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{cynthia, we don't have a lot of patients who've been in a coma for over a decade!}
<A>__{the light gets weaker. finally it just goes out. there is a general sigh of annoyance from the passengers. the light flickers on every few seconds giving off the effect of a strobe light.}
<C>__{a passenger}
<D>__{you'd think with what they charge here they could pay their electric bills}
<B>__{laughter.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{relax. they're probably giving shock therapy.}
<P>__{(for alan's benefit)}
<D>__{"it works for most people".}
<A>__{more laughter. then cynthia is riveted by the sight of something across the elevator. in the light of the next strobe like flash, we see harris! he is staring at cynthia.}
<B>__{on cynthia}
<A>__{staggered, disbelievingly, she moves behind alan, looks over to the far corner again. another flash. harris is gone. suddenly the elevator jerks to a halt, but the doors don't open. passengers groan, annoyed.}
<C>__{passenger}
<D>__{oh, great }
<A>__{the emergency bell starts sounding. cynthia, still confused, gets shoved against the back wall as the passengers busy themselves pushing buttons. cynthia bumps into the man next to her. she looks up at him. flash. it is harris. flash. harris reaches out to cynthia. she cries out, jerks away, slamming into alan, falling to the floor.}
<C>__{passenger }
<D>__{jesus, lady, relax! we're on the ground floor }
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{let me out! let me out !}
<A>__{flash. cynthia is on the floor. she raises her head. someone is on the floor right across from her. flash. it's harris. his face is burned and skeletal. he}
<B>__{grins.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{unity, cynthia... now and forever!}
<A>__{he has no eyelids or lips. cynthia screams, struggles to her feet, knocking over another passenger. now it's chaos in here.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{let me out, let me out! alan, help, help !}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{cynthia, you cannot run... you belong to us forever !}
<B>__{alan}
<A>__{struggles across the crowded elevator, catches her in his arms.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{cynthia..?}
<A>__{the elevator doors suddenly open.}
