<L>__{exterior chinook evening}
<A>__{aisha clambers onto the chinook's hull, clutching a rubber hose. screws the end to an inlet valve marked "fire retardant system". looks down at clay. with a grin:}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{open the valve.}
<A>__{tight on a 3 inch turn valve. hard hands grab and open...}
<L>__{interior chinook windowless hold evening}
<C>__{fennel}
<D>__{these guys are about to get the surprise of their lives...}
<A>__{cut off as a clear liquid begins to rain down on them from the sprinkler system...}
<C>__{fennel }
<D>__{what the hell they trying to do, drown us?}
<C>__{soldier 1}
<D>__{sir, that smell! it's gasoline!}
<A>__{their eyes go wide... hydraulics whine. the ramp lowers. the gas drenched soldiers burst out, weapons up. squinting through the fumes... clay stands alone. the men fan out around him. multiple rifles trained at his head from every direction. fennel blinks, surprised to see him alive. nevertheless:}
<C>__{fennel}
<D>__{eat the ground, or they blow your head off!}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{fennel}
<D>__{first and only warning, clay!}
<A>__{clay calmly lights a cigarette. tight on the burning cherry: the soldiers, wide eyed...}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{gasoline. muzzle flash. think about it.}
<A>__{as that sinks in fennel looks like his puppy just died. gasoline drips from the muzzle of his own tooled up h&k g36 assault rifle... clay takes a long smooth drag.}
<C>__{clay }
<D>__{things'll kill you.}
<A>__{a beat... and then the fight just goes out of the swat team. they drop their guns and raise their hands...}
<C>__{clay }
<D>__{good boys. now, let's see what kind of cargo you got in there.}
<C>__{fennel}
<D>__{clay, no bullshit you open that box and we all die.}
<A>__{clay steps up to him. near nose to nose.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm already dead, remember?}
<A>__{whap! clay's fist to fennel's jaw. knocking him cold.}
