<L>__{interior sleazy hotel room. night}
<A>__{scott, wearing just skivvies, is asleep on the bed, an empty pint bottle of booze on the night stand. we hear the television on low, showing talking heads narrating the funeral of laura newton. "our redhead, america's sweetheart", et cetera. we see a photo of her in her signature red crescent earrings. next to scott, on the night table, the envelope, holding the same red crescent earring. angle, the line of light under the door to the hallway is occupied by a pair of feet. angle. a hand, dangling off the bed toward the floor. below it, on the floor, the creased 'rogers rangers' card, and several days worth of newspapers. angle xcu scott, on the bed. unshaven. we see his eyes come open. angle on scott's hand, as it snakes quietly past the rangers card, on which we read: "rule #15: don't sleep past dawn dawn's when the french and indians attack", and comes up with an automatic pistol. angle the door, as we see the door handle move slightly. angle on scott, as he jerks open the door, his pistol at his side. angle his pov. in the doorway beyond, we see a bellboy, holding a small paper bag, looking shocked. scott shoves the bellboy back away from the door, and glances, both ways, down the hall.}
