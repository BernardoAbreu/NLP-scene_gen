<A>__{jacob smiling. the smile, however, is one of irony, not amusement. this exit too is locked. a heavy chain is wrapped through the bars. jacob stares at it with an expression of total bewilderment. a sudden muffled scream alerts jacob that he is not alone. his head turns but sees no one. he hears the scream again. he senses its direction and walks toward the men's room. a crack of light appears under the door. he can hear someone moaning inside. jacob knocks softly and the moaning stops. the lights click off.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hey, is someone in there?}
<A>__{there is no answer. jacob stands silently for a moment, not sure what to do. he can hear whispering. he chews his lower lip nervously and then reaches for the door. it pushes open. the light from the station penetrates the darkness. he gasps. he sees a man tied naked to the stall with another naked man grabbing quickly for his clothes. the bound man screams.}
<C>__{bound man}
<D>__{fuck off! mind your own business!}
<A>__{a third man spins out of the shadows, pointing a kinfe at jacob's throat.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you cocksucker! get outta here.}
<A>__{the man's face is barely human. before jacob can even react the door slams shut. the lock engages. the crack of light reappears. jacob can hear laughter coming from inside, followed by a scream. he backs away from the door. his face is white. jacob turns with full fury and storms the gate. the chain gives wayto his anger. it flies apart and the gate flings open. he stands in amazement, observing the chain as it slides from between the bars and drops to the concrete below. the gate squeaks loudly as jacob pushes it aside and clangs with an almost painful burst as he slams it shut.}
