<A>__{her.}
<C>__{cameron }
<D>__{...you tell me this wouldn't work? a pretty nurse pushing a vet in a wheelchair? when we hit that roadblock, we'd have 'em crying like babies.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{who the hell are you?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{somebody trying to stay alive...anybody that can get past the dogs and the quicksand...}
<P>__{(making a shrewd guess)}
<D>__{who did eli say i was?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i'm asking you, god damn...}
<A>__{she has fiercely grabbed his naked shoulder.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{easy with that tatoo...it mighta lost me eli, but it won me lt. emily schmidt, the greatest boobs in southeast asia...and a very patriotic chick. so i got this tattoo, for 28 bucks. and when she saw this shoulder, let me tell ya, holy jesus! following which i got the clap from the lt. and hepatitis from the tattoo needle. you know what bothers me? i think emily is gonna be very offended by eli's picture.}
<A>__{nina cannot endure another moment of this charade.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{why do they want you? what did you do?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{eli'd tell you...i was a soldier. i did the same as everybody, just one of the boys... emptied my m 16 at any sound... don't know whether i killed gooks or cherries...the new kids from the states, we call 'em cherries, which they were for maybe fifteen minutes. the dry season is when it really breaks loose. you get very tired. it's like falling asleep at the wheel. you close your eyes and it still goes on. you're killin' them, they're killin' you. couldn't tell ya now what was real except i'm here.}
<A>__{we sense in him the fatigue he is describing, then, pushing aside that memory.}
<C>__{cameron }
<D>__{hey, once when things were rough and the grass ran out, i shot the hell out of a water buffalo.}
<P>__{(he considers, then passes judgment on himself)}
<D>__{actually, i wasn't a bad soldier...better than most. got lotsa pretty ribbons. funny...sort of like when i did that first stunt and everybody started clapping... nothing like a slap on the back to ruin a man, blow his sense of proportion. so, i got home...and, uh...i guess i expected something. nothing fancy, but... something, you know...a free car wash, double blue chip stamps, extra time on the parking meter... i don't know... instead, people... uh, didn't seem too pleased.}
<P>__{(trying to hide a lot of pain)}
<D>__{in fact, they acted like i was gonna start killing babies...}
<A>__{she crosses to him, deeply moved.}
<C>__{cameron }
<D>__{shit. i was supposed to get married, run an ice cream parlor.}
<P>__{(picks up his suitcases)}
<D>__{i gotta go.}
