A SUDDEN POUNDING OF GALLOPING HOOVES breaks the peace and... A HORSE and RIDER burst between the rows of corn into the meadow.  They are running for their lives.}

The horse is frothing and wild-eyed, like the bride, who turns to look behind her in terror.  The horse's labored breathing mingles with Maggie's panicked gasps. We see a WEDDING BOUQUET fly into a ditch as the horse thunders on.  Maggie clings to the reins.  She looks as though she is running from the devil himself.}
