<L>__{interior molly's office few beats later day}
<A>__{tin cup is dutifully lying on the couch because he heard that's what you do. he stares at the ceiling. molly enters and sits down.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{roy... are you okay?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i need therapy.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{obviously.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{what do i do? i mean... to do it ... therapy... i mean, how do i start doing... it.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{in parlance you might understand, just kick back and let the big dog eat.}
<A>__{he sighs and plunges in.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{okay, okay, let 'er rip...}
<P>__{(deep breath)}
<D>__{suppose there's this guy. he's standing on the shore of a big, wide river. and the river's fulla all manner of disaster, like alligators and piranhas and currents and eddies, and most people won't even go down there to dip a toe. but on the other side of the river's a million dollars, and on this side of the river there's a rowboat. i guess my question's this: what would possess the guy on shore to swim for it?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{he's an idiot.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{no. he's a hell of a swimmer, see. his problem's more like... why's he always gotta rise to the challenge?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{he's a juvenile idiot.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{you don't understand what i mean by the river.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{we're talking about you and what you like to call your inner demons, roy, that human frailty you like to blather about, not some mytho poetic metaphor you come up with in a feeble and transparent effort to do yourself credit.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{y'mean you're gonna make me feel lousy? i came here to feel better what kinda therapy is this?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you don't have any inner demons. what you have is inner crapola, inner debris garbage, loose wires, horseshit in staggering amounts.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i ain't just some jerk driving range pro who drinks too much booze and eats too few vegetables.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you're being defensive cut to the chase and tell me why you're here.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{well... i'm smitten with a woman.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{that's good. is she smitten with you?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{not yet.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{have you asked her out?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{she's seeing a guy. i don't know how serious it is, but the guy's a real horse's ass, in my opinion...}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{if you shared your heart with this woman maybe asked her out to dinner then it would force these issues out in the open.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i'm afraid she'll say no.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{ahh... so what you're saying is that all your speeches about swimming across the shark infested waters are really just about your golf game not about your personal life.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{christ, i didn't know we were gonna get into my personal life!}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{this is therapy!}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{well, jeez, i know, but i didn't think it was that kind of therapy...}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{what were you expecting? ann landers?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{look, it's rather simple. those risks that you love to take on the golf course, the risks you talk so passionately and poetically about you need to apply those risks to your personal life with the same passion.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i should ask this woman out.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i should risk coming right over the top and snap hooking it out of bounds left.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{risk hitting it a little thin and }
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{for godsakes, roy, that's enough!}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{right. sorry.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{s'okay...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look, just walk up to this woman, wherever she is, look her in the eye with those big beautiful green eyes of yours, let down your guard and don't try to be smooth or cool or whatever just be honest and take the risk you can do it!}
<A>__{tin cup rises with new confidence. he does several deep breathing exercises, trying to work up the courage. she stares at him. and he walks right up to her.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{dr. griswold i think i'm in love with you.}
<A>__{molly is stunned.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{from the moment i first saw you i knew i was through with bar girls and strippers and motorcycle chicks, and when you started talking i was smitten and i'm smitten more every day i think about you and the fact that you know i'm full of crapola only makes you more attractive to me because usually i can bullshit people but i can't bullshit you and in addition, most women i'm thinking about how to get into their pants from day one but with you i'm just thinking about how to get into your heart }
<A>__{molly was clue less. she just stares.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{my god...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<P>__{(optimistically, proudly)}
<D>__{stunned, eh? so what about dinner and we can talk about `us' and if we have a future and how to drop that horse's ass boyfriend of yours }
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{roy, slow down }
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{hey! i just hit a eight degree driver off a cart path here, i'm staring eagle in the face }
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{this is a terrible mistake!}
<A>__{tin cup is knocked off his horse. into deep rough.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i'm acting from the heart so i can't make a mistake?! right?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{wrong. aw, shit...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i am one horrible shrink... jeez... i didn't know you were talking about me.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{would your advice have been different?}
<A>__{she's frustrated and at a loss for words.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{session's over. you better leave.}
<A>__{crushed, tin cup heads to the door, stops and turns.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i'm gonna qualify for the u.s. open and kick your boyfriend's ass.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{please leave.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{whatever you think of me, you should know that your boyfriend hates old people, children, and dogs.}
<A>__{he exits. she just sits there.}
