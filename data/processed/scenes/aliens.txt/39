<L>__{interior showers}
<A>__{high pressure water jets and a blast of hot air when you step out...a drive through car wash for people. through the swirling steam hudson, vasquez and ferro are watching ripley dry off.}
<C>__{vasquez}
<D>__{who's the fresh meat again?}
<C>__{ferro}
<D>__{she's supposed to be some kinda consultant...}
<P>__{(exaggerated)}
<D>__{...she was an alien once.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{whoooah! no shit? i'm impressed.}
<C>__{apone}
<D>__{let's go...let's go. cycle through!}
<L>__{interior mess hall}
<A>__{an unconscious segregation takes place at the troopers assemble at one long table while gorman, burke, bishop and ripley sit at another. everybody is nursing a coffee, waiting for eggs from the autochef. among the troopers dress discipline is lax...fatigues customized and emblazoned with patches. drake's tunic is cut off to a vest and has "eat the apple and fuck the corps" stenciled on back. "peace through superior firepower," "pray for war" and "i've served my time in hell: cetti epsilon nc 104" are some others.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{hey, 'top.' what's the op?}
<C>__{apone}
<D>__{rescue mission. there's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.}
<A>__{apone is stocky, grizzled, with peregrine eyes. he runs it loose and fair, but only because he knows his people are the best.}
<C>__{spunkmeyer}
<D>__{shee it. dumbass colonists. what's this crap supposed to be?}
<C>__{wierzbowski}
<D>__{cornbread, i think. hey, i wouldn't mind getting me some more a that arcturan poontang. remember that time?}
<C>__{hicks}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{looks like that new lieutenant's too good to eat with us grunts.}
<C>__{wierzbowski}
<P>__{(glancing over shoulder)}
<D>__{yeah. got a corn cob up his ass, definitely.}
<A>__{across the room, at the other table, gorman sits with his creases perfect...the consummate strack nco. bishop takes a seat beside ripley, who pointedly gets up and moves to the far side of the table. he looks wounded.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{i'm sorry you feel that way about synthetics, ripley.}
<A>__{ripley spins on burke, her tone accusing.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you never said anything about an android being here! why not?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{well, it didn't occur to me. it's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{i prefer the term 'artificial person' myself. is there a problem?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{a synthetic malfunctioned on her last trip out. some deaths were involved.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{i'm shocked. was it an older model?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{cyberdyne systems 120 a 2.}
<A>__{bishop turns to ripley, very conciliatory.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{well, that explains it. the a 2's were always a bit twitchy. that could never happen now with out behavioral inhibitors. impossible for me to harm or, by omission of action, allow to be harmed a human being.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{more cornbread?}
<A>__{wham! ripley knocks the plate out of his hand, halfway across the room.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{just stay away from me, bishop! you got that straight?}
<A>__{burke and gorman exchange glances. wierzbowski, at the next table, shrugs and turns back to the other troopers.}
<C>__{wierzbowski}
<D>__{she don't like the cornbread either.}
