<L>__{exterior graveside day}
<A>__{close on a grave, with a headstone marked anne wallace. we include the two new graves freshly dug beside it, and see the mourners gathered before them. the sight of the boy, standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother, as the bodies of his father and brother are lowered with ropes into the ground beside her, has all of the neighbors shaken. the local parish priest drones mechanically in latin. the farmers who were secretly gathered in malcolm wallace's kitchen the previous night are now glancing at william; but no one is anxious to adopt a grieving, a rebellious boy. behind macclannough are his wife and two daughters; his youngest is barely four, not half william's age; she's a beautiful girl with long auburn hair, and she clings to her own mother's hand, as if the open graves are the mouths of death and might suck her parents in too.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{...restare in pacem eternis, amen.}
<A>__{with the final amen, the neighbors drift from the graveside, pulling their children along, to give william a last moment of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies. the boy stands alone over the open graves, his heart so shattered that he can scarcely cry; a single tear makes its way down his face. and the tiny girl feels for william in a way that the adults cannot. from the ground she pulls a scottish thistle, moves to the softly weeping william and places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand. william looks up and their young eyes meet; her sad blue eyes hold william's as the grave diggers cover the bodies. then a lone, mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill above them. tall, thin and angular, in black clerical garb, he looks like the grim reaper. the girl hurries back to her mother's side; everyone watches in silence as the figure rides down to them. he is argyle wallace. he looks like a human buzzard, his face craggy, permanently furious.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you must be the relative of the deceased... william, this is your uncle argyle.}
<A>__{argyle glowers at the man, dismounts, and glares at william. william stares up at this frightening figure. they are interrupted by the ominous sound of approaching horses; a dozen mounted english soldiers, armed with lances, are approaching. argyle rattles to the priest...}
<C>__{argyle}
<D>__{you were wise to hurry.}
<A>__{the soldiers ride right in among the mourners and stare down from their saddles, haughty, menacing, their leader brusque.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{someone dead from this household?}
<C>__{argyle}
<D>__{we just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in england as well?}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{what it means in england and in scotland too is that rebels have forfeited their lands. we were ambushed last night. but the scots dragged their dead away.}
<C>__{argyle}
<D>__{my brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.}
<P>__{(to his men)}
<D>__{dig 'em up!}
<C>__{argyle}
<D>__{they've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of god's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. so please do it.}
<A>__{outmaneuvered, the leader reins his horse away. several of the farmers spit on the ground. argyle glares at them.}
<C>__{argyle}
<D>__{funeral's over. go home.}
