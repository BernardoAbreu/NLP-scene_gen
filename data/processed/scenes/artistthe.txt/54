<L>__{interior george & doris' house day}
<D>__{now wearing a suit, george is sitting at his desk. lying in front of him are the front pages of newspapers reporting the crash. he looks for something on the inside pages of one paper and reads. next to a large picture of peppy there's a review of his own film, beginning "tears of love, old and boring". he shuts the paper and searches for something in the drawer of his desk. he takes out a piece of paper. it's the telephone number that peppy had scribbled down for him. he looks at it, moves closer to the telephone, hesitates, looks at the paper again, then puts the scrap of paper back in the drawer without making the call.}
