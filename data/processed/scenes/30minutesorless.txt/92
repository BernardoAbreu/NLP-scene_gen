<L>__{interior jay's garage workshop day}
<A>__{dwayne tries will's phone again. it goes to voicemail. he explodes like a pack of mentos in a two liter of diet coke. throws his cell across the room. overturns a work table.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{does this guy know who the fuck i am!?}
<A>__{jay retreats into a corner. dwayne's a big boy, and he soon tires himself out, hunches over, panting.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{dwayne...you never told me you weren't going to give him the code.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{we're not amateurs. he was a loose end. i let him live, someday i woulda been walking out of my mansion and... bam! fbi, cia, nsa, all converging on my front lawn, 'cause a loose end turned state's evidence and they got what they need to put me away.}
<A>__{dwayne shakes his head. starts digging through the mess he's made...finds his phone.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{fuck it, jay. i will just kill the major myself.}
<A>__{dwayne keys in the speed dial code.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{don't do it.}
<A>__{dwayne looks down at the send button.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{you know what they say about a tree falling in the forest? maybe the same thing applies to blowing up some motherfucker across town. maybe it doesn't even make a sound.}
<A>__{dwayne hits send.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{boom.}
<A>__{but dwayne notices something...the phone in his hand is ringing. he puts it to his ear. the line connects }
<C>__{female voice }
<D>__{hello...who is this...hello...?}
<A>__{dwayne snaps the phone shut, looks to jay, who tries to will the beads of sweat back into his pores.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{who did i just call, jay? 'cause she sounded cute for a bomb.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(swallows hard)}
<D>__{gina kim. my seventh grade crush. or whoever lives in gina kim's house now.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{where's the number for the bomb?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{in my head. i switched it out of your phone while you were taking a shit. you're out of control, dwayne.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i'm in perfect control!}
<A>__{dwayne charges jay. jay holds up the hair clippers like a weapon, flicks them on. dwayne rips the cord out of the wall, uses it to yank the clippers from jay's hand, then whips him with the cord.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{stop it!}
<A>__{dwayne goes to whip jay again, but jay moves like a jack rabbit and delivers a fierce kidney shot. dwayne stumbles backward, falls onto the couch, groans }
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{you asshole...i make you my partner and you pull this shit...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i'm tired of you pushing me around all the time! what kinda partner does that!?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{fuck you...i'm gonna piss blood, aren't i?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{that's what it said on the internet.}
<A>__{dwayne's phone rings in his pocket.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{go on. get it out for me. i can barely move.}
<A>__{jay pulls the cell from dwayne's pocket...opens it and puts it to his ear so he can answer }
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{glad you came to your senses.}
