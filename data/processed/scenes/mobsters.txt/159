<D>__{honorable men. i welcome you today as your supreme ruler. the boss of all bosses. capo di tutti capi!}

<C>__{maranzano}
<D>__{in order to give you my complete and objective leadership, i have turned over all my personal business interests to the other members of my family.}

<D>__{i am your papa now.}
