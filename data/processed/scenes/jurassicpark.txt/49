<C>__{lex}
<P>__{(mumbles quietly)}
<D>__{'fraid of heights.}
<A>__{timmy climbs tentatively. a dinosaur roars in the distance. close on timmy's foot loses its grip. timmy hangs for a moment, held only by his straining hands. all three stop. wait. timmy regains his balance. slowly, they proceed up and over. on the other side, grant looks around. more high trees. beyond a field.}

<C>__{tim}
<D>__{we need sleep.}
<A>__{true, and grant's thinking the same thing. he looks aro und, surveying the misty forest. he looks straight up into the beautiful, tall trees that ring the wide open grassy meadow.}

<D>__{climb? again? i can't climb again?}
