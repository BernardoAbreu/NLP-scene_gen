<A>__{a peanut flies in the air. then falls into a big open mouth. thomp.}
<C>__{mouth}
<D>__{five hundred thousand is peanuts!}
<A>__{he tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth. this is dennis nedry, a 40 year old computer programmer. he's fat, with greasy hair and a permanently wrinkled suit. his slovenly looks are wildly out of place on the rich leather sofa where he reclin es. across a gleaming granite coffee table is bill baker, businessman. a smooth meticulous dresser, baker is disgusted by nedry's sloppy appearance and voracious consumption of food and drink. nedry finishes a coke. over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view.}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{i'm not reneging. i'm re evaluating.}
<A>__{nedry holds the can of coke upside down, drains the last drops.}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{you think i'm a scumbag, i know.}
<A>__{nedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table. one after the other, he throws them in the air. he gulps down two, misses one. it skids across the glossy floor. baker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at nedry.}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{look pal, you make a career in biogenetic industrial espionage, and you're bound to run across a scumbag or two. guaranteed! part of the job description. look, who's to say, who is the real scumbag? after all, i know what you guys need so bad. i've heard of reverse engineering.}
<A>__{as nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and chomps and speaks.}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{let the other guy put in all the work, all the r and d. you take the finished product, work backwards, breaking it down to reveal its genetic code. presto! in a few measly months you have know how that took researchers ten years to determine. you know how much hammond has invested of his own personal wealth? over five billion dollars! and if you guys get the jump on his in no time, the market's wide open.}
<A>__{nedry starts the laugh as he eats and talks.}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{but, boy, he's really got his product! oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money making, never heard of profit like that product. it is a sight! yes, indeedy!}
<A>__{nedry laugh s explosively. he begins to choke, coughing and gasping. baker is repulsed. he stares out the window as the sun sets. nedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat. he clumsily runs toward baker, toppling chairs as he goes. nedry grabs baker's hand and squeezes it tightly, imploring baker for help. baker coolly shakes his hand loose and shoves nedry to the floor. baker looks down at the prone and desperate nedry.}
<C>__{baker}
<D>__{scumbag. we have a deal. that deal is not open to renegotiation. or even re evaluation.}
<A>__{bakers kneels down next to nedry, who is beginning to turn blue.}
<C>__{baker}
<D>__{the deal stands. take it or leave it.}
<A>__{baker glances at his watch.}
<C>__{baker}
<D>__{i will give you a few minutes to decide.}
<A>__{nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head. baker nods back and slams his fist into nedry's solar plexus. it works. nedry sucks in a huge gulp of air. he sits up , rubbing his belly. as baker leaves the room:}
<C>__{baker}
<D>__{make sure the eggs are on that supply ship. just make sure!}
<A>__{camera leaves nedry and exits the window. it swishpans the concrete canyons of wall street and enters another office.}
