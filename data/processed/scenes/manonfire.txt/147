<A>__{creasy exits the house and stands by the pool. frank appears tail wagging and attempts to comfort creasy. leaves blow across the surface of the water. underwater slow motion, a wall turn. it looks remarkably like pinta. "blue bayou" drifts through the air. soft, in the ether somewhere. creasy hears it, half raises his head.}
<C>__{pinta's voice}
<D>__{why blue bayou, creasy? is that where you're from?}
<A>__{she's standing behind him. wearing the all too familiar one piece swimsuit, she towels her wet hair.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{blue bayou is a dream, pinta. like you.}
<C>__{pinta ghost}
<D>__{dreams are beautiful, creasy bear, but life is better.}
<C>__{creasy}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{why are you here?}
<C>__{pinta ghost}
<D>__{i have to watch you now.}
<B>__{close on creasy}
<A>__{the words are a salve, a balm. he turns, looks back over his shoulder. he's all alone.}
