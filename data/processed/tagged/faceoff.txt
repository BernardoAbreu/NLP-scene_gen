<C>__{winters}
<D>__{f.b.i.! throttle down, captain!}
<A>__{but castor elbows the throttle up. the jet lurches forward, throwing winters off balance. pollux tackles her as the jet picks up speed.}

<C>__{tito}
<D>__{you're not playing chicken with two tons of aluminum...}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{get out!}
<A>__{tito obeys as archer peels out. the hummer roars at the jet. the jet picks up speed, trying to get aloft. the humvee is aimed right at it... archer's eyes narrow.}
<B>__{collision course}
<A>__{as two hunks of metal bear down. the machines are seconds apart when archer looks up to see... winters' face pressed up against the cockpit window, castor holding a gun to her head. archer cuts the wheel just avoiding the jet. the hummer skids to a stop as federal back up arrives but too late. archer watches an fbi chopper landing in a swirl of dust. as the jet picks up speed... the hatch opens. castor blasts winters in the side and tosses her onto the tarmac.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{castor smiles at pollux, sensing freedom, until... ka chunk: something pounds the jet from above. castor leans out the hatch and sees... the chopper on top of them archer at the controls. eye contact years of hatred pass between these men. castor blasts at him from the open hatch. the chopper's left windscreen spiderwebs. archer jerks and weaves dodging the bullets. the chopper pulls away. the jet finally lifts off... when... the chopper settles on the jet slamming at its tail.}
<B>__{tarmac}
<A>__{tito reacts to this madness as the chopper plays a deadly game of leap frog with the jet. the end of the runway is coming up fast. archer crushes the jet's horizontal elevator flap.}

<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{the horizontal elevator's smashed! we can't lift off!}
<B>__{castor}
<A>__{shoots the pilot then takes the controls. he struggles to maneuver the jet. suddenly... a biplane descends right at them about to land.}
<B>__{archer}
<A>__{pulls up just as the jet swerves radically to avoid the biplane and slams into the hangar.}
<B>__{jet}
<A>__{plows through the glass door, the nose wheel snaps off. the plane skids right into the hangar finally stopping at the wings.}
<B>__{fbi chopper}
<A>__{lands. archer steps out calmly like a cop about to write a traffic ticket. he hurries to join more fbi agents rushing into the hangar ahead of him.}
<L>__{interior hangar day}
<A>__{the jet hatch pops open castor leaps from it, firing. two fbi agents drop riddled. pollux appears at the hatch an fbi sharpshooter fires, grazing pollux's shoulder. staggered, pollux falls castor catches him before he hits the floor simultaneously blasting the sharpshooter. castor drags pollux back into the smoke filled hangar. archer arrives and quickly checks the dead agents, his anger building. he signals tito and the others to spread out.}
<B>__{deep in hangar}
<A>__{a maze of airplane debris and heavy machinery. led by archer, the fbi agents pick their way through it. rookie loomis snaps alert did he see something? advancing carefully, he comes up on... castor staunching pollux's shoulder wound. pollux sees the agent and fires. loomis hits the floor his bleeding ear is shredded. suddenly a forklift charges down on castor and pollux. tito is at the wheel. castor fires forcing tito to dive off. the forklift careens on driving apart the brothers. the forklift upends a stack of heavy crates pinning pollux. castor tries to free his trapped brother.}
<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{forget it go! go!}
<A>__{he slaps his glock into pollux's hand.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{wherever they put you, i will find a way to get you out...}
<A>__{pollux starts firing covering castor as he runs through a tunnel which leads to an adjoining hangar. suddenly wanda presses her machine pistol into pollux's head. as pollux raises his gun tito grabs his hand.}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{ not unless you want that 200 i.q. splattered all over the floor.}
<P>__{(as archer approaches)}
<D>__{we got him now, jon.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{that's what you always say. seal it off. i'm going in.}
<A>__{archer moves away from the group and enters the tunnel. music as archer and castor begin their cat and mouse dance. sensing archer, castor pauses by an old landing gear. he draws a fresh pistol from his ankle holster and moves on. archer pauses at the landing gear... his own stealthy movements mirroring castor's. castor waits behind a stack of steel drums... his gaze trying to penetrate the darkness... he snaps his fingers. the sound echoes as he tries to draw archer in. archer reacts to the sound and snaps back answering the challenge. as the deadly beat between them continues blam blam blam! archer spins away just as castor opens fire from the gloom... one step ahead.}
<L>__{intercut :}
<A>__{as necessary:}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{jon, i'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{and how much will your 'fun' net you this time?}
<A>__{boom boom boom! half blind shots send castor spinning. a moment later, archer pursues... snap! he fits a new clip into his pistol.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{what's it to you? i declare it. here i am, back in the states for less than a week }
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{you're under arrest. incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent }
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{i've got something going down on the eighteenth... it's gonna be worse than anything god ever dumped on the pharaoh. i will give it up but my brother and i have to walk.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{no discussion no deals.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{what're you gonna do with me locked up? you'll drive your wife and kid nuts! i bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. what's her name, janie?}
<A>__{enraged, archer steps boldly forward trying to draw his enemy out. silence then archer senses... castor is behind him. he fires archer dives away. the barrage continues driving archer back between two huge turbine engines. as archer reloads, he stares at the control panel switches. castor moves in for the kill when he hears a final snap snap. except it isn't a finger snap... it's two switches. vrrrrooom! the twin engines roar on! unable to fight the churning tornado force wind... castor's blasted across the hangar... slamming hard into the far wall. the engines stop and archer emerges joined by tito.}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{tell me he didn't get away again...}
<A>__{then tito follows archer's gaze to castor's lifeless body. still as death somehow his mocking smile survives.}

<C>__{pollux}
<D>__{where's my brother?! i want to see my brother!}
<A>__{the van takes off passing an imposing older man, flanked by two bodyguards. bullying through the media, assistant fbi director victor lazarro scans the devastation. approaching archer, he watches as castor's body is loaded on the ambulance. a sheet covers castor's lifeless face.}
<C>__{lazarro}
<D>__{the oversight committee would've roasted us for this one thank god it paid off. damn fine work.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{real fine, victor. especially the casualties.}
<A>__{archer contemplates the slain agents their three bodies laid out in a row waiting to be zip locked. lazarro reacts grimly as a reporter snaps a photo of the bodies. instinctively, the two men close ranks. archer grabs the nikon, ejects the film, then shoves the camera back.}
<C>__{lazarro}
<D>__{classified information. no photographs.}
<A>__{lazarro puts a caring arm around archer's shoulder and leads him away from the media... and the carnage.}

<D>__{well, you tried. you failed miserably, but you tried.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{why won't she even talk to me?}
<C>__{eve}
