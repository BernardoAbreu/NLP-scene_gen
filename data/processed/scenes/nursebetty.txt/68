<A>__{betty drives along a lonely stretch of highway that slowly reveals a desert town in the distance.}
<L>__{interior canyon ranch bar day}
<A>__{big ol' place. lots of wood and red leather. betty rushes in as the clock on the wall reads 2:58. the town drunk, merle, is alone at the bar watching "bass masters" on a huge tv screen. in front of him is a remote control. a few others at tables. betty sidles up to the bar and sits down. she looks at merle, at the clock, at the remote.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{would you mind very much if i changed the channel at three o'clock?}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{he burps, then finally looks at her with bleary eyes.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{please? it's very important to me. "a reason to love" comes on at three around here.}
<A>__{he ignores her. betty puts her wallet on the bar.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{i will give you money.}
<A>__{merle slams his hand down on the bar, scaring her.}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{are you deaf?!!}
<A>__{it's 3:01. ellen draber, 40's, appears behind the bar, looks at the clock and takes the remote from merle. she changes the channel to "a reason to love" as the opening titles end. betty can't believe it. merle smiles at her wickedly.}
<C>__{merle }
<D>__{please keep it down, it's time for "a reason to love..."}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{that's real funny. why don't you have another drink?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{what's the matter here?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i begged him to let me put that on!}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{he's a prick. merle?... you're a prick.}
<A>__{merle grunts in reply. ellen turns back to betty.}
<C>__{ellen }
<D>__{so you're into "reason," too? finally, someone civilized! i'm ellen, what can i get you?}
