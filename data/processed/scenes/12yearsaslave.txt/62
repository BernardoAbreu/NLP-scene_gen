<L>__{exterior ford plantation day}
<A>__{ early to mid june, 1841 it's sunday morning. all of ford's slaves are dressed with their "finest" clothes brightly colored and as free as possible of defect. the slaves are gathered on the lawn just beyond the piazza. mistress ford is present as well. as the slaves listen, ford reads to them scripture. his tone is of a man trying to preach by way of compassion.}

<D>__{"but as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god, saying, i am the god of abraham, and the god of isaac, and the god of jacob. god is not the god of the dead, but of the living. and when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, master, which is the great commandment in the law? jesus said unto him, thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. this is the first and great commandment. and the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."}
<A>__{despite the lightness with which ford speaks and the hope in his words, eliza sits off to the side self secluded a bit weeping gently. we should be able to see in mistress ford's eyes that eliza's constant crying is unsettling.}
