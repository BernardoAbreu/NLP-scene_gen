<A>__{rambo, moving rapidly, but more carefully, glides among the trees. he stops at the bank of a tiny stream, setting down knife and pistol. scooping stinking black mud from the stream bed, he begins to slather it over his pale skin with quick, sure strokes. arms. legs. body... tight on rambo's face eyes closed, as he smears the goo thoroughly over every exposed area. his eyes open. it is a neolithic, feral visage that turns away into the foliage.}
<B>__{on the guards}
<A>__{moving forward cautiously. unfamiliar with tracking, and little else really except bullying weak prisoners, they crash around clumsily, falling and cursing in the dense thicket.}
<B>__{close on rambo}
<A>__{moving in absolute silence nearby. he freezes. fifteen meters away is a small wild pig, asleep under a knot of vines. rambo fires the makarov, hitting the earth near the pig. it squeals and leaps up.}
<B>__{the guards}
<A>__{wave their aks, looking for the source of the shot. they hear something crashing through the undergrowth to the right. movement in dense brush. they open fire. the crash of sustained fire is deafening. they blast blindly away, lighting up the forest. their attention is so focused, the din so loud, they do not notice a dark figure moving up behind them. rambo snatches the wayward last guard into a thicket, knife buried to the hilt, hand over his mouth. tay shouts repeatedly to cease firing and the others finally stop. they move away, advancing on their "target." tay gingerly parts woven branches, revealing the pig, riddled with hundreds of 7.62mm rounds. he turns to the others.}

<A>__{the other guards look around, puzzled.}
<B>__{on rambo}
<A>__{a shadow in shadows. he slips the clip from the ak 47 he has liberated, but finds it almost empty. sets it down quietly. tay spreads his men out to sweep the area in an arc. the guards advance, stricken with a growing unease.}
