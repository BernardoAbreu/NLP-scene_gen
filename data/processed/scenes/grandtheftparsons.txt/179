<D>__{of course i have friends.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{well, what would you do for them?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{anything, within reason.}
<A>__{phil stares out of the window.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{that's what i hate about people like you. everything's 'within reason'. there are always boundaries, provisos. you only operate with a safety net.}
<A>__{larry is confused.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{tell me something if it was the other way round, would gram be sitting here, driving your bones out into the desert?}
<A>__{phil says nothing.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{you've missed the pointerior see, it doesn't matter what he would do, or what you and your tie dyed friends think is the correct way to behave. to me, it only matters what i do. where you have boundaries and limits and thresholds i only have right and wrong. if i make a promise, i keep it that's right. if i break that promise that's wrong.}
