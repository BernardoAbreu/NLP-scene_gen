<A>__{an ambulance and two e.m.t.'s are on site. the combatants from the brawl are lined up on the curb. sergeant james craig, a little older and heavier than when we first met him at the train station, is standing with the girl, who is a mess. her nose bloody, her dress torn. craig shields the girl with his body, listening carefully to her and her friend as the two girls gesture angrily at the neanderthals. craig's eyes flicker in the same direction. craig's partner, leo, african american, a few years younger, is on the radio to dispatch. craig snaps his fingers at one of the e.m.t.'s and receives a blanket, which he carefully wraps around the girl. then, to his partner, indicating tyler and aidan...}

<A>__{tyler takes a beat, looking at the lineup. aidan, rubbing his wrists, gestures "let's go". tyler looks at the bloodied girl and... craig, going through the pockets of neanderthal #1.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{anything in here that's going to stab me, einstein?}
<A>__{craig finds a packet, or a vial.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{nice. you like to get high and hit women?}
<A>__{aidan gives tyler's elbow a gentle tug. tyler's caught up in the action.}
<D>__{neanderthal #1 i don't even know the bitch.}
<A>__{rage flickers across craig's face. craig moves down the line to one of the musicians, going through their pockets.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{how about you two?}
<A>__{tyler, compelled, drawing closer to the action.}
<D>__{musician #1 it wasn't us, man! neanderthal #1 that cocksucker kicked my car!}

<D>__{take a walk, i said.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{craig, big angry irish cop, turns to tyler.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{they didn't do anything. they didn't start this. those assholes did. why do these guys have to go downtown?}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{what are you still doing here?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{this is bullshit. it was those gorillas who started this.}
<A>__{craig moves slowly toward tyler and starts going through tyler's pockets, roughly. he finds his wallet. starts rifling through.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{well, mr. roth. what makes you think i give a shit?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{you're a police officer. you're supposed to.}
<A>__{what the hell? craig looks from the guy he was frisking to tyler's girl, wrapped in a blanket. she spits blood. he turns a bit to tyler.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{it's a great relief to me, mr. roth, to know that you're on top of the situation. now go the fuck home.}
<A>__{he turns back to work. tyler looks briefly at aidan. aidan looks desperate "please! let's get out of here!" tyler touches craig's elbow. aidan's jaw drops. leo takes several silent steps in. craig looks at his own elbow then looks at tyler. the kid must be out of his mind.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{how about you do your job?}
<A>__{slam. craig takes tyler's legs out, driving his face into the pavement, a gash opens above tyler's left eye. tyler lies there dazed and disoriented as craig, with one knee on tyler's neck, crushes his face into the ground. he slaps the cuffs on.}
