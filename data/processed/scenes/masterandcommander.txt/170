<A>__{jack climbs into the top. he adjusts his telescope, studies the horizon.}
<L>__{173. jack's telescope p.o.v.}
<A>__{he pans across the empty sea.}
<L>__{174. stephen's microscope p.o.v.}
<A>__{an assortment of mobile, transparent micro organisms rotating wildly.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{my god, padeen, a veritable zoo.}
<A>__{padeen takes a look, amazed then greatly amused.}
<L>__{175. the great cabin night}
<A>__{charts are spread all over the table, stephen poring over them when jack comes in}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{show me where these doldrums lie?}
<A>__{jack joins him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{stephen. will we never make a sailor of you? the doldrums is a condition, not a region. but you tend to strike 'em here...}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{...between the trades, and the sou'easterlies. i hope the acheron is having it as bad as we are.}
<A>__{stephen considers their current position on the chart, the tiny galapagos islands to the north and the vast emptiness to the west of them.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{assuming he is heading for the galapagos, and not some other point in all this vastness?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{come. i'd have thought you'd be delighted to go there. it is said to be a natural paradise}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{in truth i'd be delighted with the merest guano stained rock provided it didn't sway beneath my feet}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, we'll take on food and water once we're there, and as compensation for not having put ashore in brazil i pledge that during that time, several days at least, you can wander at will, catching bugs and beetles to your heart's delight. you will be the first naturalist to set foot on the islands. that is my solemn promise}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i accept, provided the men have not mutinied and thrown us all overboard before we get there.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{mutiny? no. they are already counting their share of the prize money.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{another week of this and they shall gladly give it up for a glass of clean water.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ach, stephen. stephen. pray stop your bellyacheing. we shall have rain presently, and if not we shall damned well tow ourselves out of this.}
