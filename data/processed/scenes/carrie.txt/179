<L>__{155 & 156 exterior road night}
<A>__{leading to henty's farm. a slight drizzle; or, the ground is still wet. a little more than a crescent moon silhouettes a group of five: billy and chris in front, and billy's twitchy zoo a completely wrecked kenny garson, a very nervous freddy de lois, and an occasionally giggling, goggled henry trennant trailing behind. de lois is swinging a nine pound sledge hammer in the air; the other two goons are struggling with an ice chest and steel pails. henty's farmhouse and barn are in the distance.}
<C>__{de lois}
<D>__{hell of a risk for a joke.}
<A>__{trennant giggles inanely. billy stops and glares at de lois.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you want out?}
<C>__{de lois}
<P>__{(hastily)}
<D>__{no, uh uh.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{it's a good joke, billy.}
<A>__{trennant giggles again. garson is stoned silly zonked, deadpan. he greedily sucks the last remnants of a joint into oblivion before our eyes. de lois angrily snatches the roach out of garson's fingers.}
<C>__{de lois}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey, piggie...}
<A>__{trennant just giggles inanely. another long beat, then:}
<C>__{de lois}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you sure old man henty won't be around?}

<D>__{shut up, henry.}
<C>__{de lois}
<D>__{whose funeral did he go to?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{his mother's.}
<C>__{de lois}
<D>__{his mother's? jesus christ, she musta been older than god!}
<A>__{trennant lurches into another cackle. and in spite of themselves, billy and chris start laughing, too. even de lois starts laughing. the group passes a "no trespassing" sign, prompting:}
<C>__{de lois}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the bastard is going to shit where he stands when he comes back and gets a look.}
<A>__{garson drops one of the pails on the ground.}

<D>__{asshole.}
<A>__{the sound of trennant's high pitched giggle.}
