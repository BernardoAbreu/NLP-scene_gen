<L>__{interior needy's house (front entry) continuous}
<A>__{needy opens the door. nobody there. she slams the door, turns around and screams. jennifer is standing in the dark hallway, looking ghostly pale and smiling. her clothes are tattered and stained her entire front is soaked in blood. her makeup is smeared, and her eyes are bruised and sunken like a zombie's. she looks horrifying, especially with that ghastly, clownish grin.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{um, jennifer?}
<A>__{jennifer says nothing and continues to smile with blood tinged teeth.}
<C>__{needy }
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{utter silence. then a dripping sound. needy looks down and sees large drops of blood spattering the linoleum. jennifer continues to smile, staring directly at needy.}
<C>__{needy }
<P>__{(trembling)}
<D>__{j jen?}
<A>__{jennifer lets out a horrifying banshee scream, wailing at the top of her lungs. she vomits a torrent of evil looking black bile all over herself and needy and staggers wildly down the hallway. the bloody black bile hits the wall, splashing a framed school portrait of needy. needy screams and watches in horror as it slides down the wall. the bile has hundred of tiny spines sticking out of it, like little porcupine needles, and it appears to move by itself, oozing across the linoleum, creeping into the corners. it's truly revolting. needy grabs jennifer blindly and claps a hand over her mouth. jennifer falls to her knees, her screams turning to jagged, insane laughter. needy tries to run, but jennifer grabs her and throws her against the wall with superhuman force, pinning her. jennifer slowly, tantalizingly brushes her face against needy's hair, her earlobe. needy doesn't move a muscle. jennifer's hand slides up needy's ribcage. she presses her lips against needy's carotid artery. we hear needy's blood pumping, swishing.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{are you scared?}
<A>__{needy nods. jennifer parts her lips. then suddenly, she stops and pulls away, pushing needy to the floor. jennifer bolts out the front door and takes off running down the street. needy is motionless for a moment, then stumbles toward the doorway.}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(screaming after her)}
<D>__{jennifer!}
<A>__{but she's long gone.}
