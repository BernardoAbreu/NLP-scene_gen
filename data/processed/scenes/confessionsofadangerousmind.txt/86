<D>__{thank you, mr. barris. i don't know if any of you are aware of this, but it's a federal offense to make licentious remarks on a network television broadcoast. the penalty for this disgusting, un american behavior is one year in prison or a ten thousand dollar fine or both. anyone making a sick, subversive remark tonight will be arrested immediately. i will then personally escort the offender to federal prison for booking under edict number 364 of the broadcast act of 1963. and it's a long drive to that prison. just you and me. no other witnesses }
