<L>__{interior "warp trail bar" night}
<A>__{high wide overhead shot of the almost closed bar. only kirk and pike sit here at a table. kirk's bloodied, tissue in his nose.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i couldn't believe when the bartender told me who you are.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{... and who am i, captain pike?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{your father's son.}
<P>__{(then, smiles)}
<D>__{for my dissertation, i was assigned the u.s.s. kelvin. something i admired about your dad... he didn't believe in no win scenarios.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{he sure learned his lesson.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{depends on how you define winning. you're here, aren't you?}
<P>__{(off kirk's look)}
<D>__{that instinct to leap without looking that was his nature, too. and in my opinion it's something starfleet has lost. we're admirable, respectable. but overly disciplined.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{those cadets you took on, they'll make competent officers but you can bet your ass they'll run home to momma the minute they're looking down the barrel of a klingon phaser cannon.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{ why are you talking to me?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i looked up your file while you were drooling on the floor. your aptitude tests were off the charts what is it, d'you like being the only genius level repeat offender in the midwest?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{maybe i love it.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{so your daddy dies... you can settle for a less than ordinary life.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{or do you feel like you're meant for something better? something special?}
<A>__{and that just hangs there for a beat. because pike just hit a nerve. kirk does his best not to show it still absent mindedly fiddling with starfleet ship salt and pepper shakers.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{come to think of it, i do want to feel special. you know what? i'm gonna go start a book club }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{enlist in starfleet.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{enlist. you must be way down on your recruiting quota for the month }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{if you're half the man your father was, jim, starfleet could use you. you could be an officer in four years, have your own ship in eight.}
<A>__{he's getting under kirk's skin but kirk keeps up the 'tude, grabs his jacket, stands }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{we're even, right? i can go.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{riverside shipyard. shuttle for new recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.}
<P>__{(kirk turns, pike grabs him)}
<D>__{your father was captain of a starship. for twelve minutes. i dare you to do better.}
<A>__{eyes lock... and it's now pike who stands and walks off. and that's where it hangs. off kirk, brooding...}
