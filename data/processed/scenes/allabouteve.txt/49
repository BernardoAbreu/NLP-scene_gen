<A>__{karen is seated unobtrusively in a rear lower box. lloyd sits beside max up front. on stage, the play is "on its feet." eve plays a dramatic scene with a young man. they carry "sides" but do not consult them. as she speaks, eve moves upstage, turns to face the young man who is forced to turn his back to the auditorium. bill calls a halt. he indicates to eve that she was to have remained downstage. eve seems to be at a loss. she looks at lloyd. lloyd rises, says that he told her to make the change. bill comes down to the footlights to tell him to stick to writing, he'll do the directing. it mounts swiftly to a screaming fight. bill throws the script out into the auditorium, takes his coat and stalks off. eve runs after him. max retrieves the script. lloyd remains adamant. karen has risen in dismay. eve drags bill back. without looking at lloyd, he takes the script from max, tells the actors to pick up where they left off. eve whispers to lloyd from the stage. lloyd smiles, mollified, sits down again with max. karen walks up the side aisle, out of the theater...}
