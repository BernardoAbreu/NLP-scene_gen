Abdullah and his sons, Yussef (13) and Ahmed (14), are sitting on the floor around the small table, looking at a well- conserved .270 caliber Winchester 60 rifle.}

<CHAR>__{HASSAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{With this rifle, your sons will be able to kill plenty of jackals. He aims at the rock and pulls the trigger without holding the rifle properly. It is clear that he doesn't know how to fire a weapon, and the shot cracks loudly. The rifle kicks and hits him roughly in the shoulder. The bullet flies far wide of the rock. The women laugh nervously. Rubbing his shoulder, Hassan turns to Abdullah.}

<CHAR>__{HASSAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{This is the safety. Push it in when you're ready. Ahmed nods. Unsure of himself, he raises the rifle and, almost without aiming, fires. The shot kicks up dust far from the rock. His sisters laugh.}
<CHAR>__{HASSAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{If he doesn't hit the jackals, at least he'll scare the shit out of them. Ahmed lowers the rifle. His father grabs it and gives it to Yussef enthusiastically.}
<CHAR>__{ABDULLAH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Your turn. Yussef grabs the rifle and loads it confidently. He lifts the rifle with ease and takes his time aiming. He seems innately skilled at the maneuver. He shoots and the bullet hits just below the rock. Abdullah celebrates the shot and mockingly turns to Hassan.}

<DIAL>__{About how your wife killed herself by jumping off the balcony.}
<CHAR>__{YASUJIRO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{My wife never jumped off a balcony. She shot herself in the head. My daughter was the first to find her. Kenji is left speechless.}

Yasujiro is affected when he sees his daughter like this, but says nothing. He slowly walks toward her. Chieko looks hurt, but whole. Yasujiro stands beside her. They look at each other. Chieko holds out her hand and takes his. Chieko squeezes. She looks at the city and then looks at her father's eyes. He strokes her hair and they both stand on the balcony, with the massive city sprawling under them.}
