<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{stay in your house and stay down on the floor!}
<A>__{yuki speeds after her, but this time she pops the curb and drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for her. the bride runs into the house she's in front of. she runs through the living room, to the kitchen and the back door, but the kitchen's where the family that lives here is hiding and they block the door. yuki's sports car pulls up in front of the house. she stands up in the convertible. takes out a grenade, pulls the pin and says;}

<B>__{when...}
<A>__{yuki fires up at her, hitting her twice in the leg. the upstairs hallway, two bedroom doorways line both sides of the hallway. the bride crashes to the floor screaming blood pours out of her gunshots. yuki charges up the stairs...machine gun blazing, tearing up the house. the bride aims her 9mm where she expects yuki to emerge. yuki gets to the top of the stairs, and steps into the hallway. the bride fires... the bride's bullet wings yuki in the left breast, knocking her through a bedroom doorway.}

<C>__{yuki }
<D>__{that fucking does it!}
<A>__{yuki comes around the corner firing her machine gun in the bride's direction, ripping up everything around her. the bride lying flat on the floor fires her 9mm. the explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat. yuki charges the bride, kamakazi style. three more bullets rip into the bride, the bride fires up at yuki, hitting her three times in the body, knocking her off her feet, and sending her tumbling down the stairs. the bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs. she sees yuki lying at the bottom, dead. yuki's face, dead, eyes closed...then they pop up open... guess what...she's not dead. though she's bloody and her schoolgirl uniform is filled with bullet holes she rises. her head turns in the direction of the bride... the bride sees this and can't believe it... they lock eyes... ...yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that builds to a scream... she charges up the steps at the bride. the startled bride fires at her...the 9mm's empty... yuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high... the bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her ankle holster. yuki chargin... the bride cocks back the hammer... ...yuki charging, getting closer... the bride fires bullet hits yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but she keeps charging... the bride fires again... yuki jerks but keeps on charging... bride fires... yuki jerks, but keeps charging... bride fires... yuki jerks, keeps chargin, almost at her, knife raised high... the bride fires yuki jerks, but keeps charging, knife ready to do its duty... the bride fires, but her gun jams... yuki leaps on her with the knife... they struggle for a moment...}
