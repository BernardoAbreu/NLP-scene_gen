<A>__{camera pulls back to include peggy lying on a cot. she wears the same dress she had on at the reunion. she's terrified. we near a smattering of background noises: names are called, nurses helping, etc. looking up she sees: the iv. the nurse taking the iv out of her arm, and placing a vial of blood on a tray with several others. peggy sits up slowly, dazed and frightened. she looks at the nurse.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{would you like your twinkie now?}
<A>__{peggy takes the twinkie, staring at it blankly. looking around she sees students giving blood to the red cross. several have tubes in their arms. nurses attend to them. carol sits up drinking a cup of juice, waving weakly at peggy. maddy, now a brunette, slowly rolls down her sleeve. arthur, dolores, walter and several others from the reunion. everyone is younger but instantly recognizable.. charlie walks over to peggy. he grins at her, revealing wax vampire fangs in his mouth, hair brylcreemed to death.}

<A>__{charlie walks away towards walter and arthur. peggy gazes after him, his body blocking her view of a portion of a banner hung on the wall. it reads: "support the buchanan high blood drive..." as charlie exits, the final words come into view: "spring 1960." peggy gasps. she begins to tremble.}
