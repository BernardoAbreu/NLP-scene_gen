<L>__{interior toby and caroline's kitchen dusk}
<A>__{caroline pirouettes for her two roommates, kathy, a diffident, sweet faced young woman, and marian, a heavyset, loud, red faced woman who eats compulsively from a package of oatmeal cookies. both of the women ooh and aah over caroline's dress.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{that belt just makes it.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{it does pick up the green, doesn't it?}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{and you say he's getting serious already?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{yes, i think. he keeps talking about marriage, keeps saying he wants to meet toby.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{well, that's it three dates and you got 'im good.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i don't know if i want him }
<A>__{she stops as toby enters the kitchen.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{don't want who?}
<C>__{kathy}
<P>__{(about toby)}
<D>__{little pitchers...}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{well, it's the tough guy who can't be bothered to go to school.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(to toby)}
<D>__{oh, it's nothing we were talking about dwight. i told you about dwight.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{he the one drives down from the boondocks? the mechanic? dwight. what a stupid name.}
<P>__{(he draws the name out)}
<D>__{dwiiiight. duhhhhwight. dwight tah h h h. dwighttahhhhh.}
<A>__{there is a knock on the front door. toby sticks his head around the door, looking into the living room. a man is outlined against the sunset, only his black silhouette is visible. it is our first glimpse of dwight. has the man heard him? toby doesn't know for sure. caroline brings dwight into the kitchen. he is older than her, an attractive enough man. he is well built, has a full head of brown hair, and very white teeth. those are his good points. on the minus side: his over eagerness to please, his nervous smiles and his clothes. he wears two tone shoes, a hand painted tie, and a monogrammed handkerchief, folded beyond perfection, in the pocket. caroline introduces him to marian and kathy. then she introduces dwight to toby. dwight is all smiles.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{would you like coffee before we go? or a coke?}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{you know, i believe i could stand a cup of java.}
<A>__{as caroline pours the coffee, dwight turns to toby.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{so you're toby.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{you're not toby?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{oh, he wants to be called 'jack.' it's so silly... ever since he read jack london.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{well, i will call him anything he wants.}
<P>__{(to toby, confidential)}
<D>__{i always say people can call me anything they want, long as they don't call me late for supper!}
<A>__{kathy and marian think it's pretty funny. they laugh. caroline smiles. toby just stares.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{so, jack, you like school?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{he might like it if he ever went there and tried it.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, have another cookie, marian keep your strength up.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{i'd like to just yank that nasty tongue of yours out by the roots.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(to dwight, light)}
<D>__{my son's decided to try to drive me into an early grave. truly.}
<C>__{caroline }
<P>__{(to toby; not so light)}
<D>__{you straighten up and be polite, you hear me?}
<A>__{dwight takes a swallow of the coffee. his eyes widen.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{who made this?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i did...}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{well, well, well, all i can say is that you people are pretty lucky to live in a house where oh.}
<A>__{marian puts a cigarette into her mouth. dwight jumps up, pulls a velvet case from his pocket and extracts a mono grammed zippo. he snaps open the top of the lighter against his leg, and holds the flame in front of marian's face. she lights her cigarette. then dwight perform the zippo drama in reverse. what a conversation stopper. finally, kathy speaks to toby.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{i hear you're invited up to dwight's next week for thanksgiving.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{aw, you'll love it. great air, great water. for scenery, all you have to do is step outside your front door and open your eyes. and there's a turkey shoot thanksgiving day. your mom said you might like it, so i signed you up.}
<A>__{toby sits up, eager.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{really? i can shoot my winchester? great! i bet i could be the one to get the turkey.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{well, amazing: it can sit up and talk like a normal human being.}
<P>__{(notices the time)}
<D>__{dwight, we're going to be late.}
<A>__{she grabs her coat (which dwight jumps up to hold for her) and they exit. as dwight leaves he kisses his hand, then throws the kiss toward marian and kathy. the instant the front door slams:}
<C>__{toby marian kathy}
