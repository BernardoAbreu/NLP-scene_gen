<L>__{exterior early morning thunder bay}
<A>__{robbie, cowboy and melinda from grounds, who we met earlier and was conned into the contest because she said she surfed once on vacation, are all standing in front of the judges. one judge explains the rules.}
<C>__{head judge}
<P>__{(looking down at clipboard)}
<D>__{alright, here's the deal. you get three tries; three heats. we judge each run and only your high score counts. if you fall you get no score for the run. your score will be added to the total for your team, and the winner gets the surfer king trophy. any questions?}
<A>__{they all shake their head no.}
<C>__{head judge }
<D>__{then let's begin. grounds is up first.}
<A>__{melinda grabs her board and begins paddling out. the wave comes and it's all she can do to stay on her board. she struggles and falls at the end. she will clearly not be a factor. the big screen shows a 0 in a column after the grounds score. we look back to the bleachers to polite applause, but the colonel and the grounds kids are clearly disappointed. cowboy is out there now, the wave comes and he catches it easily. he rides the wave gracefully and well, and kicks out at the end. the big screen shows an 8 in the lifeguard row. the lifeguards and richard are cheering now. robbie is nexterior he catches the wave and rides it more aggressively than cowboy, but nearly falls at the end of his run. the big screen shows an 8. the concessions kids and aokee are very enthusiastic. they can see they have a chance with robbie. pipeman is watching from a far corner. melinda begins her second run. she is a little more confident this time, but still seems barely able to stand and ride the wave. more polite applause, and the big screen shows a 5. cowboy catches his wave, and tries to imitate robbie's more aggressive style, but falls midway through the run. we hear a large gasp from the crowd as this happens. the crowd applauds politely, and the guards are supportive but disappointed. we see the judges confer and the big screen shows a 0. robbie gets his wave, and surfs it aggressively again, this time not nearly falling at all. the judges nod approvingly and confer. the big screen shows a 9. the crowd goes wild, especially the concessions kids. melinda begins her final run. she does better than the past two, but not significantly. the judges confer and the screen shows a 5. the ground kids are very disappointed, they know they are out of it now. the colonel shakes melinda's hand and thanks her for her efforts. cowboy gets his wave, and has clearly decided to go back to his original style; he rides the wave gracefully, but takes no chances. he kicks out at the end with a wave and a smile. the guards applaud, hoping to make it seem better than it was, and the judges confer and the screen shows an 8. robbie snags his wave and rides it aggressively again, but loses his balance momentarily. it costs him; the judges confer and the screen shows a 7. the concessions kids applaud, and the point totals show "grounds 98", "concessions 102" and "lifeguards 102". everyone is confused, there has never been a tie before. the judges are flipping through papers, and big mike steps up to the microphone.}
<C>__{big mike}
<P>__{(clearing his throat, flustered)}
<D>__{it looks like we have a tie. this has never happened before, but i seem to remember we provided for this possibility in the rules. hopefully our judges can help us figure out what to do!}
<A>__{the head judge is reading to the other judges out loud, slaps his hand on one of the papers and comes up to the mike.}
<C>__{head judge}
<D>__{reading from the rules, "...in the event of a tie at the end of three heats in the surf competition, the teams who are tied will participate in a sudden death surf off. additional heats will be run until a winner can be declared."}
<P>__{(looking up at the crowd)}
<D>__{the "sudden death" heat will begin in five minutes.}
<A>__{everybody cheers...they're going to see some more great surfing. the judges signal cowboy and robbie to come over. the head judge takes a quarter out of his pocket and points to cowboy to call it. it lands and the judge looks at it. he points to robbie.}
<C>__{head judge }
<D>__{you want to go first or second?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{second.}
<C>__{head judge}
<D>__{be ready in five minutes.}
