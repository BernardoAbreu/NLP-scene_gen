<D>__{after the funeral.}
<A>__{joseph turns and reenters the room with the coffin. bobby watches him from behind, as his hand runs along the top of the casket. we hear:}
<B>__{brrrrrrruuummm...brrrrrrruuuummm...brrrrrrruuummm...}
<L>__{exterior interboro cemetery day}
<A>__{a limousine pulls up against the backdrop of thousands of tombstones. emerging are bobby and joseph. they are both wearing dark sunglasses. rosario and sandra and the children get out behind them and are led away by funeral coordinators to another place in the coming processional. in the distance, many many people and a long line of cars move toward the two brothers. the undertaker walks away briefly, to direct some traffic. bobby slowly puts his arm around joseph's waist, prompting:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{bobby... i'm real glad you're with me now...}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{course...}
<A>__{joseph grows more emotional, adjusts his sunglasses. leans to bobby, clears his throat. sotto:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{you know, i was...i was jealous of you, [for a] long time.}
<A>__{bobby is surprised to hear this admission, and is taken aback by the honesty of it especially in this moment. joseph grabs his brother's arm, his voice cracking:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky }
<D>__{...i always did what pop wanted. and you were free...}
<A>__{bobby tears up, his voice breaking too; he shakes his head:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{no.... i did it to hurt him... i disappointed him...}
<A>__{interrupting the moment, the undertaker approaches:}
<C>__{undertaker}
<D>__{gentlemen?}
<A>__{the undertaker guides the two men toward the procession. just as the drums reach a thunderous volume, we go to:}
<B>__{minutes later.}
<A>__{a line of cars files into the cemetery, led by the hearse. the procession is phenomenally long. the new york skyline is in the distance. uniformed police line the narrow road. the coffin is removed from the hearse, put on wheels for the move to the gravesite. bobby, joseph approach. the drums continue:}
<B>__{brrrrrrruuummm...brrrrrrruuummm...brrrrrrruuummm...}
<A>__{people get out of their cars. many of them we recognize from elsewhere in the film but don't know by name. one of the people to emerge from a town car is marat buzhayev and his ever present babushka wife, kalina. the walk begins, with everyone saluting bobby and joseph. behind them, the mayor, the commissioner, all the rank and file of the force. the turnout is enormous. rosario is here too, though several rows back. she is with the women. bobby peers at the procession, which is made up of hundreds of saluting cops, others. among them, we spot:}
<B>__{louis falsetti.}
<A>__{at that moment, bobby sees his old friend, and the two make eye contact. bobby is greatly moved by his appearance, and nods subtly to jumbo. louis salutes gently, a slight and sympathetic smile coming across his face... simultaneous: joseph takes a look at the coffin, grows more distraught. he breaks down. bobby is there to catch him and does. several white gloved cops move to help, and then, trying to recompose himself, he squeezes his brother's forearm for support. tries to straighten:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{...it's all right... i will be all right...}
<A>__{bobby is devastated by seeing his brother like this and is momentarily rendered speechless. he tightens his own grasp around joseph, leads him on the walk behind the coffin.}
<B>__{further down the processional}
<A>__{rosario. walking. eyeing the cops, the cop wives. she does not fit in. cops are staring at her. she sees cop wives looking at her, leaning over to each other and talking about her. though she can't hear what they're saying, she is made to feel terribly uneasy... rosario quickens her pace away from them, and the march}
