<L>__{interior biology building #7 day}
<A>__{long benches are covered with antarctic flora mosses, lichens and liverworts. they are being nurtured and studied by scientists who look like homeless people unkempt beards, bloodshot eyes and sun damaged skin. carrie throws back her hood and unzips her jacket. approaches one of the scientists with familiarity, who is in the process of extracting an ice core sample from a stainless steel cylinder.}

<C>__{sapperstein}
<D>__{ follow me.}
<A>__{he leads her to a bench in the corner on which stands a glass herbarium containing only stalks and a few heat lamps. one of the glass panels has been smashed.}

<D>__{they took it all.}
<C>__{carrie}

<C>__{sapperstein }
<D>__{my weed, man. i've been growing it all summer and they took it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it was just budding, too.}
<A>__{he sends an evil glare across the room to four glassy eyed scientists sitting around a desk, munching on potato chips, candy bars, and drinking beer. stifling laughter.}
<C>__{sapperstein }
<P>__{(glaring)}
<D>__{it's not funny!}
<A>__{carrie looks back to him can barely stifle a laugh.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{professor sapperstein, i'd like you to read something for me.}
<A>__{she pulls out a small leather fold chained around her neck. opens it up. puts it in front of his face.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{what's this say?}
<A>__{he's not sure what she's getting at }

<A>__{she closes the fold, lets it drop around her neck.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{very good.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now are you still sure you want to report the theft of an illegal narcotic?}
<A>__{he actually ponders the question for a moment. carrie puts an arm around his bony shoulder and steers him away from the others.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{professor...are you planning on doing the winter over?}
<C>__{sapperstein}
<D>__{not this year, no.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{good. and how are you feeling right now?}
<C>__{sapperstein}
<D>__{you think i'm crazy? is that what you're saying?}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(pacifying)}
<D>__{no, no, not crazy. but this time of year, down here, we're all going a little toasty aren't we? how about you plant a little cannabis when you get home?}
<A>__{she pats him on the back.}
