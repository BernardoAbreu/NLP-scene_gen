<A>__{pinta leads the way. all enthusiasm, away from her parents. a 150 pound black german shepherd greets them. sniffs creasy's pant leg, unsure.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{do you like dogs, mr. creasy?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{if they like me.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{frank doesn't take to most people. do you speak german?}
<C>__{creasy}
<P>__{(in german)}
<D>__{ein klines bisschen. [a tiny bit.]}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{frank only responds to commands in german. he was trained in frankfurt. my dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.}
<A>__{creasy follows her. frank pads along after them. creasy's room not like downstairs, but comfortable enough.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{we fixed the room up two weeks ago. mom and i. it's nicer than before.}
<A>__{creasy takes a stroll around it, ignoring her.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{you've got a cd player if you like music. i like music a lot.}
<A>__{caw! creasy looks over at a cage on a stand holding a macaw. it tilts its head at the big man. a tv and vhs machine in the corner.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{that's 'bird.' emilio forgot to take him with when he left.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{who's emilio?}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{my last bodyguard. he drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.}
<A>__{finally creasy turns, looks at her hard.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i'm here for you?}
<A>__{pinta smiles huge, nods.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{in between you can take mom shopping and to lunch. does that sound alright, mr. creasy?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{creasy. just call me creasy.}
<C>__{pinta}
<P>__{(big grin)}
<D>__{creasy...}
<A>__{frank's tail wags imperceptibly.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{looks like he approves of you.}
<A>__{and then, walking on air, she's out the door. creasy sets up his room with meticulous precision that comes from years in the military. front and center he arranges his shrine: an almost empty bottle of scotch and a glass (engraved from an earlier encounter) next to a pack of marlboros and his weathered zippo. then, his beaten up gun and holster. a well travelled new testament is placed in the drawer. creasy's bag he reaches in between the shirts, pulls out a fresh bottle of scotch. he breaks the seal, unscrews the cap. he pours a double... triple... wait, what do you call a full glass of scotch? caw! the macaw squawks it's disapproval. he ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, tries to catch it on the back of his hand. an old game with himself. his hand is too shaky. the bullet bounces off, hits the floor. creasy picks it up. ejecting the magazine, he starts to oil the weapon. caw! as the macaw squawks, creasy looks up. it doesn't feel like this relationship is going to work.}
