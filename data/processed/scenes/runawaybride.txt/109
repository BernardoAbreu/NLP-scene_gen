<L>__{interior new york bar day}
<A>__{the bar from the opening scene. george swilling, the same man ike talked to before, is sitting on a stool, nursing his drink. he looks better. ike enters. george looks up and recognizes ike, who takes the bar stool next to him.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{get this man a kamikaze.}
<C>__{george}
<A>__{splendid dissection of maggie carpenter, very professional job. ike sits and leans over to george.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<A>__{you could have told me you were fiance number three.}
<C>__{george}
<A>__{and end up in the papers? i've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you. i'm sorry she got you canned.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{thanks.}
<C>__{george}
<A>__{she's a cacophony of contradictions.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{well, i'm writing another article on the cacophony.}
<C>__{george}
<A>__{ah, can't stay away from her, can you? like a moth to a flame.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{guess you'd know about that. you're an entomologist, right? how's business?}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(taking a sip of his drink)}
<A>__{not bad. i was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when maggie met me.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<A>__{neuter a locust, feed the world.}
<C>__{gorge}
<A>__{not the world. just africa and china. ike wipes the smirk off his face. like maggie's other men, this guy has a worthy accomplishment under his belt.}
<C>__{george }
<A>__{you know maggie was the only girl i ever met who would hold my tarantula. on the first date.}
<C>__{ike }
<A>__{so, tell me, george, why do you think she ran?}
<C>__{george}
<A>__{same as you said. what did you call her? a "man eater", "a devouring death goddess."}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i don't think that's why she ran.}
<C>__{george}
<A>__{why do you think she ran? ike sips his drink before answering.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i don't know. i'm working on it. i was on the wrong track.}
<C>__{george}
<A>__{and you defending her?}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{no. i call it like i see it. i'm a journalist. i'm a truth teller.}
<C>__{george}
<A>__{unbelievable, she got to you.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{oh, please!}
<C>__{gorge}
<A>__{join the club.}
<P>__{(passing him his drink)}
<A>__{here, you need this more than me. george heads out.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(protecting, taking}
<D>__{his tape recorder}
<P>__{out of his pocket)}
<A>__{i'm writing an article, i'm getting paid to do this, it's going to be a cover story, it's going to be published ... the facts will be read someday. as george pauses in the doorway, ike holds up his tape recorder.}
<C>__{ike }
<A>__{what kind of eggs did she like?}
<C>__{george}
<A>__{poached, just like me. george exits.}
