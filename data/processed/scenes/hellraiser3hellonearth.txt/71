<A>__{joey's hands grip her steering wheel tightly. her face is drawn and grim. the box is on the seat beside her. she is driving very fast. she has to slam on the brakes at a red light. she pounds at the dashboard in frustration.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{c'mon. c'mon!}
<L>__{exterior the streets of the city night}
<A>__{close on a terrified face. the face belongs to eddie, a 20 year old runner for a drug gang. his head is pressed tight against a brick wall. his nose is bleeding and his eye is red and ready to bruise.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i will get it! i promise! i will ...}
<A>__{a fist slams into eddie's face. wider angle reveals an alley. eddie is being held against the wall by two uniformed cops, one in his 40's, one in his 20's. the elder cop has just punched eddie in the face.}
<C>__{elder cop}
<D>__{don't promise me shit, you little fuck! you know what your promise is worth to me? huh? fifty per cent of fuck all!}
<C>__{younger cop}
<D>__{give him the money, eddie.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i don't ...}
<A>__{a big back handed slap from the elder cop.}
<C>__{younger cop}
<D>__{give him the money, eddie.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{just listen to me, please! i ...}
<A>__{the elder cop gut punches him and eddie doubles up.}
<C>__{elder cop}
<D>__{i'm done listening, shit brain! where you been all day? they shut the school? kindergarten closed? no customers? huh? huh?}
<C>__{younger cop}
<D>__{give him the money, eddie. tell ya, i'm gonna puke if he beats on you any more. just give him the ...}
<A>__{the younger cop pauses, looking beyond them down the alley as a long black shadow falls over them.}
<C>__{younger cop}
<D>__{... money. what the ... ?}
<A>__{the elder cop, at the change in his partner's tone, looks up. standing in the center of the alley at its far end, light coming from behind him so that he is unclear, is pinhead.}
<C>__{elder cop}
<P>__{(calm. expecting obedience)}
<D>__{you, fuckoff.}
<A>__{he turns back to eddie.}
<C>__{elder cop}
<D>__{get your head outta your stinkin' ass and look at me, boy.}
<C>__{younger cop}
<P>__{(still looking down alley)}
<D>__{hey ...}
<A>__{pinhead is moving up the alley towards the action. elder cop shoves eddie away.}
<C>__{elder cop}
<P>__{(to eddie)}
<D>__{get lost.}
<A>__{eddie doesn't waste time with questions. he's gone. the cops straighten up and start walking to meet pinhead. pinhead advances still in the shadows, still just a black shape moving forward.}
<C>__{elder cop}
<D>__{i have the distinct impression i told you to fuckoff. unless i miss my guess, you've just disobeyed an officer of the law.}
<A>__{pinhead emerges into the (dim) light in the alley.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{i am the law.}
<A>__{cops halt in shock at this awesome presence, both of them instinctively drawing their guns. and both instinctively beginning to back up.}
<C>__{elder cop}
<D>__{you're one butt ugly son of a bitch and you're about to dead meat.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{i am the son of eternal night and you are about to discover pain has no ending.}
<A>__{well, that's enough of a direct threat for any officer of the law. both cops fire their guns. once. twice. three times. pinhead keeps walking. he spits out the bullets that his body has absorbed.}
<C>__{younger cop}
<D>__{oh shh ...}
<A>__{they empty their guns useless and then they turn and run down the alley. and then stop short. there is a sudden wall of impenetrable blackness in front of them as if the world simply comes to a stop four yards from their feet. the cops turn, terrified, to look back. instinctively, they spread apart each walking near to opposite walls. the younger cop is standing beneath a fire escape. he glances up as if he might be able to jump up to safety. no. too high. pinhead's head flicks upward as if in a gesture of command. suddenly, the fire escape ladder zooms downward with impossible speed and force. the younger cop doesn't even have time to scream. the ladder smashes right through his body, impaling him. his corpse stands there twitching and shuddering, wrapped around the ladder. elder cop stares in terror at his partner's fate.}
<C>__{elder cop}
<D>__{no. no. no. no. no. no.}
<A>__{pinhead stands very still and speaks very calmly.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{curb your tongue.}
<A>__{the elder cop's body starts to move involuntarily. his movements are jerky and spasmodic as if his mind is trying to fight what his body is trying to do. pinhead's head moves through various positions. his face is calm, showing no particular pleasure at what he is doing but only a fascinated concentration as if experimenting with new found skills. the elder copts shaking puppet like hands draw his handcuffs from his belt. his eyes show terror. everything else is beyond his control. he raises the cuffs to head level and springs one of them open. his mouth suddenly jerks open and his tongue protrudes. the fear in his eyes increases. he moves the open cuff over his tongue. he's making panicked moaning noises as if trying to scream. slam! he drives the cuff closed right through his tongue! and screams (as best he can). pinhead looks beyond the cop to the wall of blackness and makes another commanding gesture with his head. a chain flies from the darkness and wraps itself around the other cuff. the chain pulls taut and then suddenly retracts into the darkness, hauling the cop off his feet and dragging him along the alley into the blackness. the cop screams and moans all the way until he is enveloped into the darkness and then the sounds suddenly stop dead.}
