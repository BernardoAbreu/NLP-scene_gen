<L>__{exterior exercise yard, east baton rouge parish prison day}
<A>__{high stone walls topped with concertina wire. looming guard towers. thick fog blankets the yard filled with convicts. jesse takes hold of a metal bar, lifts it from a bench press. he does two reps. the weights bang down and jesse sits up.}
<C>__{ray o.s.}
<D>__{this place is bad...}
<A>__{ray adds weight to the already excessive amount. he sweats as he talks nervously over jesse's shoulder...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{there's eyes everywhere. like i got a sign on my back, jesse, they all think i talked.}
<A>__{jesse scans numerous white cons watching the wheeler brothers.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{just the other day... some spic fish got hit with a weight. ten other cons, they beat him and stabbed him till there weren't nothin' left. and the guards let it happen.}
<A>__{ray fastens the safety collars and jesse leans back.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{his brains were on the wall, jesse. like somebody painted 'em.}
<A>__{jesse does another set. weights bang down. he slowly sits up.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{they come at you?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{not yet... but it's in the mail. i can feel it fuckin' coming.}
<A>__{ray shoots a look at a group of aryan brothers across the yard. czapp, their "leader," and roach. jesse turns. czapp looks at him. eyes meet. jesse leans back. the press shakes as jesse does a last set. his red strained face as the bar lands with a crash.}
