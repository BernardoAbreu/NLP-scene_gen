<A>__{the saipan, a tricked out jet foil, built for speed not looks, gunmetal blue, lean and mean, rips across the choppy water. the rolling stones streetfighting man pours out of the jet foil, reverberating over the waves, as the camera rushes right at the windsheild and into...}

<A>__{stripped down, low frills, high tech... ...where john t. finnegan, bathed in the last light of day, all taut muscle and sinew, all business, with every one of his 38 years etched on his rugged, good looking face, is harnessed into the steering pylon, wrestling with his steering sticks, holding the bouncing jetfoil steady as he can, hauling ass, propelled, it seems, by the music blasting out of four state of the art speakers bolted to the metal walls. light from the laser imagers plays across finnegan's face. the face of a man in his element, on the edge, in control. he barks commands into his radio headset.}
