<A>__{backs away but does not run. the time has come to face her fears. angle shadow on tunnel #3 wall as jason takes one more vengeful stroke, finishing him off. he steps from tunnel #3 with the scarlet coated tool, his shadow becoming flesh. he moves straight for sean, who has no hope for escape. jason cocks the wrench over sean's skull...and suddenly his hockey mask is splashed with a bright light. jason stops, turning directly into it. jason's point of view rennie is blinding us with the sanitation engineer's flashlight, giving us only brief glimpses of herself in the reflective wet surroundings.}

<D>__{you never got me in the lake, jason. and you're not going to get me now either.}

<B>__{jason}
<A>__{has been sufficiently taunted. he moves after her. jason's point of view as the bright beam leaves our eyes, rennie dashing down the intersecting tunnel (#1). tight on jason's feet stomping through the sludge, picking up speed. he's wanted to kill rennie most of all.}
