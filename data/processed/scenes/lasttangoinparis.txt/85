<L>__{interior salle wagram salon day}
<A>__{as paul waxes on, we watch a tango contest in progress. he wanders rudely between the dancers on the dance floor, invading their space and lighting a cigarette.}
<C>__{paul's voice}
<D>__{but you know, what the hell. i'm... no prize. i picked up a nail when i was in cuba in and now i got a prostate like an idaho potato. but i'm still a good stick man, even if i can't have any children. let's see. i don't have any stomping grounds. i don't have any friends. i suppose if i hadn't met you, i'd probably settle for a hard chair and a hemorrhoid. anyway, to make a long, dull story even duller, i come from a time when a guy like me would drop into a joint like this and pick up a young chick like you and... and call her a bimbo.}
<A>__{he reaches the other side of the dance floor where jeanne waits for him. she is able to smile now at his shenanigans. he has a real joie de vivre about him now that he lacked}
<B>__{previously.}
<A>__{she sits down at a guest table on the outskirts of the dance}
<B>__{floor.}
<A>__{he approaches her table and feigns a gentleman persona.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm awfully sorry to intrude but i was so struck with your beauty that i thought i could offer you a glass of champagne. is this seat taken?}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{may i?}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{if you'd like to.}
<A>__{he sits down with her. he claps his hands.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{garcon!}
<A>__{a waiter comes over.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{you know, the tango is a, is a rite. do you understand "rite"? and you must watch the legs of the dancers.}
<A>__{the waiter comes over, he turns to chat with him.}
<C>__{dance floor}
<A>__{we watch one of the dance couples dance the tango. we focus on their legs and feet. we make it back to paul and jeanne and champagne.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{oh, no! you haven't drunk your champagne because it was warm. and then i ordered you a scotch and you haven't drunk your scotch.}
<C>__{dance floor}
<A>__{we watch a different couple dance. paul tries to butter up (pardon the pun) jeanne.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{come on. just a sip for daddy.}
<A>__{she takes a sip from the glass he offers her.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{now, if you love me, you'll drink all of it.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{ok, i love you.}
<A>__{she slams it back.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{bravo!}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{tell me about your wife.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{let's talk about us.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{ok. but this place is so pitiful.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes, but i'm here, aren't i?}
<A>__{he kisses her on the cheek.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{monsieur maitre d'hotel.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's rather nasty. anyway, you dummy, i love you. and i want to live with you.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{in your flophouse?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{in my flophouse. what the hell does that mean? what the hell difference does it make if i have a flophouse or a hotel or a castle? i love you. what the fuck difference does it make?!}
<A>__{she peeks out a smile. he may just be winning her back over.}
<C>__{dance floor}
<A>__{we watch a couple as the music stops. all the patrons clap as the dance floor clears. the president of the tango contest speaks at a microphone.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{the jury has chosen the following ten best couples: number 3! 7! 8,9 ...11, 12...13, 14 ... 15 and 19!}
<C>__{president }
<D>__{and now, ladies and gentlemen, good luck for the last tango!}
<A>__{more clapping patrons. we get back to paul and jeanne. she sits 2 tables over, pouting, while he struggles to light his cig. she holds up her glass to him.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{give me some more whisky.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh, i thought you weren't drinking.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{but i'm thirsty now and i want some more drink.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{all right. i think that's a good idea.}
<A>__{he starts to bring the bottle to her then stops, gets his drink and brings it too.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{wait a minute. because you're really beautiful. wait a minute. i'm sorry. i'm terribly sorry. i didn't mean to spill my drink.}
<A>__{he pours her some. she holds her glass up.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{let's have a toast to our life in the hotel.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no! fuck all that! come on. no. hey, listen. let's drink a toast to our life in the country. huh?}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{you're a nature lover? you didn't tell me that.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh, for chr... i'm a nature boy. can't you see me with the cows and the chicken shit all over me?}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{oh, yeah. to the house of the cows.}
<A>__{she holds her glass up again.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{cows.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{i will be your cow, too.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{and listen... i get to milk you twice a day. how about that?}
<A>__{she lays her head on the table.}

<D>__{i hate it! i prefer to go to the hotel. come on, let's go...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no. let's dance. come on. don't you wanna dance? we can start again.}
<A>__{he crouches down. she climbs on his back for a ride. he pulls her on her back onto the dance floor, through the tango contest. the jury is in an uproar. the tango president freaks out.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{that's the limit! what are you doing?}
<A>__{they lie on the floor... they get back up and feign some}
<B>__{tango.}
<A>__{the president comes out on the floor now to them. she grabs paul who had dipped jeanne over the jury table.}
<C>__{president }
<D>__{you'll have to leave, sir.}
<A>__{she starts scurrying them off the dance floor.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{madame! 'tis ever love.}
<A>__{she continues to shew them away. and she can hold her own against paul's smart ass mouth.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{go to the circus if you want to see love! go on! get out of here! you'll have to leave.}
<A>__{paul now grabs her and starts spinning and dancing with her. he sweeps her up into his arms. she struggles and paul puts her down. she continues to shew}
<B>__{them away. paul continues to mock her.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh my god, i've never...}
<A>__{he pulls his pants down and moons her.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{kiss me, sweetheart! she is appalled and slaps him on the arm as he scoots to the}
<A>__{door, jeanne following.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{farewell, you sweet peach blossom.}
<A>__{as they get to the door he spins one last time.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{i could dance for ever. oh, my hemorrhoid!}
<A>__{he loses his balance and slips. jeanne has to catch him.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{beauty of mine, sit before me. let me peruse you and remember you always like this.}
<A>__{they sit in some tables in a closed, darkened section. jeanne puts her head down on the table in exhaustion. he claps loudly till she wakes up. he puts on his english}
<B>__{accent again.}
