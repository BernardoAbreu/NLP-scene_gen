<L>__{interior club night}
<A>__{raquel and dennis move past a hulking doorman, making their way down a narrow stairway. dennis is suitably impressed.}
<B>__{the club}
<A>__{is elite, underground an "abattoir chic" version of an old time juke joint with a greasy, dangerous vibe. white tiled walls and floors for easy hosing, chromed fittings, run off gutters, drains. no bar.}
<B>__{bodies}
<A>__{writhe on the strobe lit dance floor. a heavy s&m scene. leather. latex. tattoos. body piercings. a d.j. wearing head mounted spotlights orchestrates the tunes on twin decks. music assaults us a beat so heavy it could jar the fillings from your teeth. brutal "darkcore" along the lines of prodigy or underground. raquel pulls dennis out onto the dance floor. they sway. a lupine featured gaultier girl with a streak of white running through her raven hair moves in behind dennis, pressing up against him. rachel williams as the angel of death we'll call her mercury. mercury flicks her tongue against dennis' ear it's been pierced with a silver post which clicks against her teeth. tattooed across her back in black is a swirling, tribal vortex. dennis is now sandwiched between raquel and mercury, the three of them dry humping their way to every man's glory. the beat gets louder. the action heavier. the atmosphere more narcotic. people are stripping off their clothes, sweating like fiends. it's a virtual orgy. dennis laughs, reveling in the hedonism. everything rises to a fever pitch }
<C>__{dennis}
<P>__{(over the music)}
<D>__{fuck, i need a drink!!!}
<A>__{raquel just smiles then dennis notices a drop of something spatter his hand. it looks like blood. dennis looks up, concerned more blood droplets are falling. raquel's face is sprinkled with them now. dennis stops dancing. what is this? some kind of fucked up performance art? raquel turns her face toward the ceiling, as if washing herself in a summer shower, now the other club goers are looking up too }
<B>__{blood showers down}
<A>__{from sprinkler heads in the ceiling, drenching the dancers. the club goers love it, thrusting their heads back, mouths open wide to receive the crimson offering. horrified, dennis recoils, turning towards raquel, whose face morphs into a preternatural snarl. her canines extend, tapering to razor sharp points. her tongue flicks, lizard like as fingernails sharpen into claws. all this while the whites of her eyes bleed red, pupils oscillating hypnotically.}
<C>__{raquel}
<D>__{what's wrong, baby?}
<A>__{dennis screams, pushes away from raquel, only mercury has fangs now too. in fact, everyone in the club does, with the exception of poor dennis. that's because they're all vampires. dennis tries to run, but the burly doorman blocks his exit, brutally smashing his fist into dennis' face. dennis falls, dazed. the club goers close in around him. they make a game of it, shoving him from one person to another, their pale faces leering like twisted jack o lanterns. the strobe lights quicken to a seizure inducing intensity. dennis spins, tumbling into raquel's arms. she shoves him forward dennis lands on the floor, falling at someone's boot clad feet. he looks up. a dark figure sits in the shadows, unnoticed until this moment. the figure stands, moves into the light as time screeches to a halt a black man, towers above dennis, wearing dark glasses and a leather longcoat a sneer of cruel contempt etched upon a face tempered by a lifetime of horror. his name is blade. blade whips open his long coat, shrugging it off, revealing an arsenal of high tech weapons strapped to his body:}
