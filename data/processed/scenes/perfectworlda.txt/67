<L>__{interior motor home back office}
<A>__{red sits in his office chair, pulls out the spoon and pours geritol from a bottle into his coffee. he doesn't even look up when sally enters, a stern look on her face.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{we need to talk, chief garnett.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{call me red.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{red.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why are you so hell bent on embarassing me?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{i'm hell bent on one thing. you hang around long enough you'll find that out. til' then a tough backside and a sense of humor will get you through a lot.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i have a fine sense of humor, but the one thing i won't do is be your straight man so you can play hero to a bunch of morons who think you're some kind of hillbilly sherlock holmes.}
<A>__{red sips from the mug calmly then groans, his face contorted.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{awful. arthur godfrey says it keeps ya' young, but i'm not sure it's worth it.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i'd like an answer.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{this yer' first time out of an office?}
<A>__{she refuses to answer.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{thought so. what'd ya' expect ya' signed on for?}
<A>__{adler, bobby lee and kaiser all watch the discussion, smiles on their faces. sally abruptly closes the door.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{you think i'm what? some dumb schoolgirl who wandered into the boy's locker room? well you're wrong. i don't mean to boast, but i happen to be one of the two most intelligent people involved in this fiasco.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{didn't ask that. asked what you expected.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i expected to be allowed to do the job assigned to me by the governor.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{i happen to like the governor, hunt quail together every year. but deep down he and i know that win, lose or draw this is my ship, not his.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{the governor as chief executive officer of this state bears ultimate responsibility for...}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{... bullshit. responsibility lies with the one that loses sleep; the one with the most ulcers. this mess turns bloody and it might all it's gonna cost the governor is a few votes! me, i'm the one that's...}
<A>__{red catches himself about to get too personal. he takes another swig of his coffee geritol. sally softens her stance.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{you're the one that what?}
<A>__{but red side steps.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{tell ya' what. you think i'm makin' a wrong turn you speak up. might not agree, but i will listen. as far as stepped on toes and wounded pride, i will buy everyone a drink when we head for home. not until. i got more to worry about.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that sound fair to you?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{well okay then.}
<A>__{sally turns, about to leave.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{so who's the other one?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{other one?}
