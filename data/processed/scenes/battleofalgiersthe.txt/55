<L>__{54 kader's house. inside. day. september 30, 1956.}
<A>__{djamila, the girl who in january, in rue random, gave the revolver to ali la pointe, is now standing in front of a large mirror. she removes the veil from her face. her glance is hard and intense; her face is expressionless. the mirror reflects a large part of the room: it is a bedroom. there are three other girls. there is zohra, who is about the same age as djamila. she undresses, removing her traditional costume, and is wearing a slip ... there is hassiba who is pouring a bottle of peroxide into a basin. she dips her long black hair into the water to dye it blond. every action is performed precisely and carefully. they are like three actresses preparing for the stage. but there is no gaiety; no one is speaking. only silence emphasizes the detailed rhythm of their transformation ... djamila's lightweight european dress of printed silk ... zohra's blouse and short skirt to her knees ... make up, lipstick, high heeled shoes, silk stockings ... hassiba has wrapped her hair in a towel to dry it ... a pair of blue jeans, a striped clinging tee shirt ... her blond hair is now dry. she ties it behind in a ponytail. hassiba has a young, slim figure. she seems to be a young european girl who is preparing to go to the beach. continual silence. djamila and zohra have finished their preparations and sit down to wait. hassiba is still barefoot. she is putting on her sandals, when someone knocks at the door. djamila gets up and goes to open it. it is kader. a quick attentive glance; djamila ... zohra ... hassiba ... hassiba responds to his look with a gay and somewhat coquettish expression; she says, stressing her french:}
<C>__{hassiba}
<D>__{ca va, monsieur?}
<A>__{kader smiles for a second, without any gaiety, but to please her. then he speaks briefly and harshly in arabic. and turning one at a time to each of the three, he gives them three addresses.}
<C>__{kader}
<P>__{(to djamila)}
<D>__{number three rue de chene.}
<P>__{(to zohra)}
<D>__{number fourteen rue monseigneur leynaud.}
<P>__{(to hassiba)}
<D>__{number twenty one rue de l'hydre.}
<A>__{each one of the girls repeats, in turn, the address which he has given her. each one of the three responds emotionally. the atmosphere is tense. kader bids them farewell according to the algerian custom, first bringing his right hand over his heart. then he embraces them. they look at him for a moment; they are embarrassed. kader tries to ease their discomfort, smiles, and answers hassiba's previous remark.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{ca va ... et bonnes chances!}
