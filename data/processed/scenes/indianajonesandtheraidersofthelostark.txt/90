<L>__{interior command tent tanis digs night}
<A>__{belloq, shliemann the ranking nazi, and shliemann's aide, gobler, come into the tent, which is full of charts and maps, drawings of the ark, radio equipment, liquor and food. the men have been out digging for the well all day. they are tired, discouraged, testy. in all matters, gobler shows his alliance with shliemann against belloq with small looks and body language. the frenchman has disappointed them and he is feeling the isolation of a scapegoat. belloq gets himself a drink as shliemann towels off his face.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{i cautioned you about being premature with that communique to berlin. archeology is not an exact science. if does not adhere to time schedules.}
<C>__{shliemann}
<D>__{the fuhrer is not a patient man. he demands constant reports and he expects progress. you led me to believe }
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{nothing. i have made no promises. i said only that it looked very favorable. perhaps the ark will still be found in an adjoining chamber. based on the information in our possession, my calculations were correct. perhaps some bit of evidence still eludes us. perhaps}
<C>__{gobler}
<D>__{perhaps the girl can help us.}
<A>__{belloq shoots him an angry look.}
<C>__{shliemann}
<D>__{my feeling exactly. she was in possession of the original piece for years. she may know much.}
<P>__{(really evil)}
<D>__{if properly motivated...}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{i tell you, she knows nothing useful.}
<C>__{shliemann}
<D>__{i'm surprised to find you squeamish. that is not your reputation. but it needn't concern you. i have the perfect man for this kind of work.}
<A>__{shliemann signals gobler, who steps outside the tent a moment, calls someone and then reappears. belloq looks warily at the entrance. after a moment belzig enters, reeking villainy. when his eyes find shliemann, his superior, he snaps a crisp "heil, hitler!" at him, holding his palm rigid a long time, exposing a burned scar in the prefect shape of the sun medallion.}
