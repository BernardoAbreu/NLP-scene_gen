<A>__{pearce's entry hall. cara unlocks the front door with a key and walks inside.}
<L>__{interior alexander's villa video monitors continuous}
<A>__{track from screen to screen as we follow cara moving through the deserted rooms. everything is cold and lifeless. like a palace that has been turned into a museum.}
<L>__{interior church continuous}
<A>__{while everyone is focused on the monitors showing cara's progress, frank notices some movement in a monitor far off to one side... it shows the lower floor of the house.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{who's that?}
<A>__{they all turn to look. a male figure, his face masked, approaches the lens of the surveillance camera... blink! the feed shuts off. ackerman barks at a technician.}
<C>__{ackerman}
<D>__{what happened? get it back on line!}
<A>__{the surveillance techs begin madly punching buttons, etc.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{was that pearce?}
<C>__{goyal}
<D>__{how did he know there would be a camera?}
<A>__{blink! another monitor goes dark. then another.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{he's taking out the entire surveillance system }
<C>__{ackerman}
<D>__{stop him.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{i can't! he's cutting the feed at the source.}
<A>__{frank looks anxiously at cara on the monitor climbing the stairs... blink! she disappears from view as well. everybody starts talking.}

<C>__{goyal}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{what should we do?}
<C>__{ackerman}
<D>__{shut up! everyone.}
<A>__{they quiet down. ackerman turns to the tech.}
<C>__{ackerman }
<D>__{do we still have audio?}
<A>__{the tech nods.}
<C>__{ackerman }
<D>__{turn it up.}
<A>__{everybody in the church stands stock still. staring at the dark monitors. listening. cara's footsteps click up the stairs and then slow... they move tentatively across the floor. we hear a thump. a door or a heavy footstep? cara's breathing gets louder. there's somebody else in the building.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{alexander?}
<A>__{no response. click, clack, click... she takes a few steps. on frank concerned. on ackerman calm.}
