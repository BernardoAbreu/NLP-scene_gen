<L>__{exterior eddie's neighbor's terrace night}
<A>__{eddie's hand, still holding glass, cuts the awning rope holding up the awning... the awning comes down on the thug, a huge canvas curtain dropping between the thug and eddie. blam! blam! several holes appear in the canvas as the thug tries to shoot eddie anyway, but eddie has leapt out of the way. thug's pov under the curtain as he wrestles it off... he sees eddie, on the ground, prone, just watching him calmly. he starts to smirk. eddie touches a match to the ground. the flame shoots across the floor to the thug, who now realizes he's standing in a puddle, the overturned can of bbq fluid next to him. in an instant, his legs and pants are on fire. now the man screams. shoots blindly. but click! is out of bullets. he rushes at eddie, screaming, on fire, in animal rage. eddie brings up a wrought iron patio chair to meet him, catching him squarely in the ribs. he gasps, bends over... looks up at eddie, beaten... the face that looks back is without pity.}
