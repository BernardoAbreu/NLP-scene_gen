<L>__{67 interior night s.b.}
<A>__{screaming, scott stumbles through her bedroom with shelly still upon him biting at his throat.}
<L>__{68 interior night m.r.}
<A>__{they stagger into the main room where scott manages to knock shelly off himself and into the fireplace. she remains motionless as her head smolders upon the hot coals. scott rushes to her, grabs an arm and pulls her out. shelly's face and hair on one side of her head are seared and blackened. she blinks her eyes open, turns her charred head to scott, and speaks in a rasp.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{thank you. i don't know what i would have done if i had remained on the hot coals burning my pretty flesh. you have pretty skin give it to us!}
<A>__{cackling, shelly clutches scott's neck and begins throttl ing the life out of him with a vice like grip. he tries to break the hold but cannot. ashly also tries but with a backhand blow, shelly knocks him into a cabinet, smash ing it to bits. a garbled cry for help escapes from scott's frothing mouth. shelly reaches down, picks up the sumarian dagger, and holding scott by his throat with one hand, she raises the dagger with the other. ashly, slightly injured, crawls to his feet. scott grabs her raised arm and although choking, swings his camping knife from its side sheath and slices deep into shelly's raised wrist, almost severing it. a murky black ooze pumps from the wound. she emits an ear splitting howl and tightens her grip on scott's throat. he drops the hunting knife. ashly watches terrified, unable to move as shelly raises her dangling hand (still clutching the dagger) to her mouth and bites it off. the useless part falls to the floor with the dagger still firmly in its fist. scott, now almost dead, grabs her severed hand clutching the dagger and in a last attempt, swings it around ramming the blade into her spine. shelly screetches along with cheryl in the cellar, the old grandfather clock gongs and lightning strikes all at the same instant. shelly reaches around with her remaining arm to clutch at the severed hand and knife protruding from her own back. a thick black ooze pours from the wound as she bends backward screaming. ashly stands in horror, clutching the axe, unable to move. black ooze runs from shelly's mouth as her body writhes about spasmatically upon the floor. gradually, the move ments cease and she is dead. as scott slowly stands to his feet, shelly's arm grabs his leg.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{ahhhhhhh!}
<A>__{some force reanimates her, even though the body is dead.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{no...no...no...}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{hit her!}
<A>__{shelly's body is hoisted up, jerking about to its feet, and laughing madly.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{hit it!}
<A>__{scott screams this as he backs toward ashly who stands with the axe, paralyzed. gurgling black ooze, shelly advances toward them with one remaining arm. scott grabs the axe from ashly, pushes him away and slams it into her. lightning flashes, thunder booms, and cheryl screams from the cellar. scott brings his axe down again and again in a frenzy. then, after the final chop, there is silence. shelly's body remains on the floor for quite some time until ashly can cope with the fact that she is dead and something must be done.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{uh...scott.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{what is uh...what are we gonna do?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{bury her.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{you...can't bury shelly. she's a friend of ours isn't she?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{ash, she's dead.}
<A>__{ashly moves away from scott.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{shelly's dead. we're gonna bury her now.}
<A>__{ashly bites his lip and looks about blankly.}
