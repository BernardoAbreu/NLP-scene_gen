<L>__{exterior moors by the sea evening}
<A>__{arthur and perceval rise, and as far as they can see across the green hills that roll down to the sea lies the aftermath of the massacre. hacked bodies, abandoned armor, steaming horse carcasses, everything still. the murmur of the dying is carried on the wind to the soft roar of the sea. the squires have fled the scene of horror.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{but for mordred. where is mordred?}
<A>__{elsewhere on the battlefield, mordred searches the dead, accompanied only by his lieutenant, who turns over the bodies of arthur's knights.}
<C>__{mordred}
<D>__{where is arthur?}
<A>__{one of arthur's knights reaches out blindly for help. mordred crushes his skull underfoot. the shaft of his huge lance is caked with blood, as are his hands. arthur and perceval see mordred and his lieutenant, and the king restrains perceval from going forward.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{no, perceval. now it is time for me to raise my sword.}
<P>__{(he bellows out)}
<D>__{mordred, prepare to meet your death.}
<A>__{shield on his left arm, and excalibur in his right, he starts toward mordred.}
<C>__{mordred}
<D>__{i wait for you, father.}
<A>__{mordred advances forward, the huge spear in both hands and parallel to the ground. arthur goes straight for him, shield ready to receive the blow. mordred keeps walking, his arms now tensed back and ready to strike. once they are within weapon's reach of each other, mordred dashes forward and thrusts the spear. it glances off arthur's shield, slides under his hauberk and penetrates the king's body, and so powerful was the blow that the blade pierces him right through. mortally wounded, arthur's scream of pain becomes a horrible war cry, and he drives himself forward with all the strength he has along the spear shaft almost to mordred's hands. mordred is knocked back and to the ground and arthur presses down on him, the butt of the spear pinning mordred. arthur lifts excalibur. mordred attempts to free himself, as the blade of excalibur descends upon him and cuts through metal, flesh and bone. mordred's head falls to the ground, rolling away. mordred's lieutenant flees. perceval races to arthur's side, and supports the king who has fallen on his knees. arthur speaks through the pain:}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{draw the spear from me. do it.}
<A>__{perceval holds the king tight to himself with one arm, while with the other he draws the shaft through and out of arthur's body. arthur sags but doesn't fall. perceval begins to remove his armor to get at the gaping wounds. the king speaks slowly, softly, from outside his own pain wracked body.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{there is one thing left to do... excalibur... and you must do it, perceval. leave my wounds, i command you.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{i cannot }
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{ take excalibur. find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it.}
<A>__{perceval, stunned by the command, doesn't move.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{obey me, perceval. you must act for me. it is my last order as your king. do it, and be back!}
<A>__{perceval picks up the sword, mounts his horse and rides inland. arthur watches him go, struggling with the pain, still kneeling, and then his head falls to his chest.}
