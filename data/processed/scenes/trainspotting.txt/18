<A>__{renton has his eyes closed. they snap open. he looks down between his legs. he drops to his knees in front of the bowl and rolls his sleeve up. with no more hesitation he plunges his arm into the bowl and trawls for the suppositories. it seems to take ages. he cannot find them. he sticks his arm further and further into the toilet, moving his whole body close. he strains to find it. his head is over the bowl now. gradually he reaches still further until his head is lowered into the bowl, followed by his neck, torso, other arm, and finally his legs, all disappearing. the cubicle is empty.}
