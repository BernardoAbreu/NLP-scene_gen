<L>__{interior inflatable golf dome late afternoon}
<A>__{the second level of a large indoor driving range mini golf course. the sound of clubs smacking golf balls echo as an intense ted "waggles" before his shot. on his back swing, tiffany throws her arms around him from behind.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i take it you're done?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{yup.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{wanna hit some of mine?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(hugging him harder)}
<D>__{nope.}
<A>__{he turns, laughing. they kiss as she playfully starts to grope him.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{now this is definitely a violation of golf dome policy.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{must be all this talk about using your wood.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{woods. so maybe later i can... check your grip?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{secret?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{my dirty talk sucks?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{i like it when you try, though.}
<A>__{tiffany gives him a peck and flits back to a nearby chair. he hits one, skying it into a low hanging light.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you know in some states they actually do this outside?}
<A>__{tiffany looks over at one of the tacky tropically theme'd mini golf holes.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{so how many insurance companies are there in the united states? like, a billion.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that's not the point, tiff. i've busted my ass for liberty capital. i don't want to quit. i deserve to be promoted out of this ice bound backwater.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{and when it happens, i guess i will just be another notch on your briefcase.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i can't believe you said that. you know you are...}
<A>__{he looks around. embarrassed, he lowers his voice.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{...the most important thing in my life.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(smiling shouting)}
<D>__{sorry, what was that! you want to take me right here?}
<A>__{as other golfers look over, tiffany and ted share a warm smile, the moment only broken by the ringing of a cell phone. she sighs, unzips ted's gym bag and answers his phone.}
<C>__{tiffany }
<D>__{psychic... uhm, sorry, hello? yeah. look, is this a matter of life and death, because right now he's...}
<A>__{suddenly concerned, she hands the phone to ted.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{hello? (beat) you're kidding me.}
<P>__{(almost stunned)}
<D>__{yeah, i will hold.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{your mom?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{million dollar life policy just checked.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{on a saturday? what about the first annual golf, sex and pizza triathlon?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, if this is... who i think it is, i may have found us a ticket out of here.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{we don't need a ticket.}
<A>__{tiffany stands, knowing it's no use arguing, she pulls on her coat. ted tries to give her a hug. she falls into his embrace, but doesn't hug him back.}
<C>__{tiffany }
<D>__{don't be late, ok?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you won't even know i'm gone.}
<A>__{corpse's pov: black. the drawer is pulled open. we are...}
