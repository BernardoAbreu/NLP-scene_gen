<L>__{exterior training hall evening}
<A>__{shifu and po walk through the palace courtyard. po has an easy spring in his step.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{you have done well, panda.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{done well? done well?! i've done awesome!}
<A>__{he swings his belly around and knocks shifu off balance. shifu staggers back, regaining his dignity.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{the mark of a true hero is humility!}
<A>__{after a moment's thought, though, he leans toward po }
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{but yes...you have done awesome.}
<A>__{and he punches him playfully on the arm. po smiles at him. as they laugh, an indistinct figure appears in the clouds behind them. it's crane! crane carries the five to the palace grounds, crashing in a heap.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{huh? guys? guys!}
<A>__{po throws his backpack aside and runs over to them.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{they're dead? no, they're breathing! they're asleep?! no, their eyes are open.}
<A>__{crane struggles to lift his head.}
<C>__{crane}
<D>__{we were no match for his nerve attack.}
<A>__{his head collapses to the ground.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{he has gotten stronger.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{who? tai lung? stronger?}
<A>__{shifu starts freeing the five. first viper, then mantis, then monkey releases suddenly from his paralysis }
<C>__{monkey}
<D>__{he's too fast!}
<A>__{he delivers a kung fu punch to po's head and then slowly realizes where he is.}
<C>__{monkey }
<D>__{sorry, po.}
<A>__{shifu kneels before tigress and works to free her.}
<C>__{tigress}
<D>__{i thought we could stop him.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{he could have killed you.}
<C>__{mantis}
<D>__{why didn't he?}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{so you could come back here and strike fear into our hearts. but it won't work!}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{uh, it might, i mean, a little. i'm pretty scared.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{you can defeat him, panda.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{are you kidding? if they can't they're five masters. i'm just one me.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{but you will have the one thing that no one else does.}
