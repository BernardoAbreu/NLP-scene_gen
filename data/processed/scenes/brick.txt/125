<L>__{interior dressing room night}
<A>__{brendan kicks in the door. kara sits in front of the mirror in a soft pink robe, a boy on the floor beside her. she gasps.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{brendan. did you hear about dode?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you scheming tramp. you set that poor kid up, you hid him, fed him your tale. you got info from laura and held dode like a card till you could play him. for money!}
<A>__{brendan throws a chair. the boy stands.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you'd bury me at the same time, but it was mostly for the money. you got dode thinking em had his kid, thinking i did it, and that was enough for him, but he stuck to the money cause you had your claws in him, cause he couldn't come away from the deal without it and make you happy.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{sit down, you're a mess. russ, go get my shoes from the wardrobe locker, would you sweetie?}
<A>__{he goes, trying to look mean at brendan. brendan and kara watch each other like caged rats.}
<C>__{kara }
<D>__{still wish you knew what you wanted to know? if it's any consolation, it probably wasn't dode's kid. it might have been tug's, but frankly i wouldn't bet a horse it was a crowded field there at the end.}
<A>__{brendan grabs a clock and throws it. kara's mirror shatters, revealing a grimy dark wall behind.}
<C>__{kara }
<D>__{meany. you want my tale, brendan? i still know what dode was selling, but i'd play it smart. a quick call from a payphone to copland, they drag the tunnel and you're through.}
<A>__{she comes very close to him. her robe falls open slightly.}
<C>__{kara }
<D>__{five thousand. cash. i know you can get it from the pin, but even if you can't i want it by first period tomorrow, or i play my hand and bury you.}
<A>__{she turns away, lets her robe fall.1}
<C>__{kara }
<D>__{now get out.}
<A>__{brendan's eyes burn. he lunges at her.}
