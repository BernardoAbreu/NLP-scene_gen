<L>__{interior claude's guest room night}
<A>__{claude sleeps in bed. margot gently touches his face. she whispers:}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{are you asleep?}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{will you remember this?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i just talked to your dad...}
<A>__{claude's eyes remained closed, but he smiles.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i'm only going to tell you if you won't remember.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{margot hesitates. she changes her mind and says thoughtfully:}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{everyone finds you so funny and charming. i always get compliments about you.}
<A>__{margot stands. she catches herself in a warped mirror and smears some eye make up off of her face.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{are you having fun? is it nice to see pauline?}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(opens his eyes)}
<D>__{yeah, i really like her.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{yeah. she is crazy though.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{in what way?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{she's really berserk. maybe it's hormones. you don't notice anything different about pauline?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{she's pregnant she told me. but she's keeping it a secret i mean from malcolm and even ingrid. which i think is unforgiveable. now she'll have to marry him. what's she planning to get married and not drink champagne? then she'll just be lying. i guess she's afraid she'll miscarry. she probably will. i think on some level she's ambivalent about the marriage and that's why she's not telling him.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{are you stoned, mom?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{maybe a little.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i don't like it.}
