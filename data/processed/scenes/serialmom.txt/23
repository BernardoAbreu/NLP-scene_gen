<L>__{23. interior chip's bedroom.}
<A>__{on chip's large video screen plays the ridiculously dated but still appalling scene from "blood feast" where the madman with the corny, madeup eyebrows rips a girl's tongue out of her mouth in hokey special effects. subtitle reads "4:22pm" and fades out. chip and birdie are hooting and hollering and eating popcorn as scotty looks up from his vintage nudist camp magazine to watch in real horror and nausea.}
