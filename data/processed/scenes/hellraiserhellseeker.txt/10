<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{trevor's eyes blink open, darting left and right. he is on a bed, his head bandaged. an angular nurse enters the room, walking up to trevor's bed.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{where is she...? where's kirsty?}
<A>__{the nurse grabs trevor's right arm and straps it to the side of the bed. she isn't exactly one of god's gentler creatures.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{hey, what are you }
<A>__{she moves to trevor's legs, strapping them down as well, then his other arm. by now several surgeons enter the room, features obscured by surgical masks. the nurse fastens a clamp around trevor's head, attaches it to the bed. trevor is completely discombobulated. the surgeons gather behind trevor's bed. close on trevor's face as he struggles to see what's happening back there but it's useless. he cannot move a muscle. he hears a sickening sawing noise and his eyes bulge in horror. wide as the doctors calmly lift trevor's freshly sawed cranium from his head exposing his brain. the chief surgeon a large unshaven man with magnifying lens alreaday in place make his eyes enormous and his face grotesquely distorted. he walks up, presented with a tray full of evenly arranged pins. he cranks up the magnification of his lenes which make his eyes appear even larger. though no one speaks his name his name tag reads dr. barker.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what are you people doing?!}
<A>__{the chief surgeon takes one of the pins and gently pushes into a trevor's frontal lobe.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{what's happening to !}
<A>__{trevor's eyes glaze over and his jaw relaxes. the chief surgeon speaks in an english accent.}
<C>__{chief surgeon}
<D>__{as you can see i just accessed the speech center, temporarily shutting down all verbal ability.}
<A>__{as the chief surgeon continues he takes several more pins off the tray.}
<C>__{chief surgeon }
<D>__{the goal is find the exact point in the brain where moral decisions are made, the place where right and wrong is distinguished. in exploring this morality center i will most likely be triggering memories, disrupting the unconscious. our patient may experience some distress during the proceedings but they are not due to pain. it is merely our patient recalling his past...}
<A>__{chief surgeon slips another pin into trevors exposed brain.}
<C>__{chief surgeon }
<D>__{as he was thrown into the lake, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown.}
<A>__{the chief surgeon voice lowers and his eyes turn black. the eye magification no at a hideous level, showing jet black eyes.}
<C>__{chief surgeon }
<D>__{where you will be tormented day and night}
<P>__{for ever and ever. (rev.20:10)}
<A>__{trevor looks at the frowning nurse who is watching over him. chief surgeon sticks a needle into another spot on trevor's brain. trevor's pov: the nurse is suddenly a pale gargoyle with blackened eyes. trevor opens his mouth to scream and in a burst of white light, an angelic woman is now standing before him. she is bathed in a haze of white light.}
<C>__{angelic woman}
<D>__{well? what do say trevor? que pasa?}
<A>__{trevor relaxes. his bindings are gone. the gargoyle nurse is gone. the surgeons are gone. and his brain is sitting safely within his inviolated skull, upon which now sit a few electrodes. the bandage is no longer there. but from his pain wracked expression we know the pain in his head is still very real. he reaches for his head, makes sure its all intact.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{where do i start?}
<C>__{angelic woman}
<D>__{how's the old noggin? any change in the intensity?}
<A>__{she touches him gently.}
<C>__{angelic woman }
<D>__{can you describe the pains?}
<A>__{trevor looks up. the angelic woman smiles back at him. she's in scrubs, a stethoscope dangling from her neck. trevor winces.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i'm not sure. how about a jackhammer in the occipital lobe?}
<A>__{she picks up a pad and scribbles something on it. trevor notices she's wearing a nameplate. dr. allison dormere.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{are you a dream too?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{still hallucinating as well. hmm...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what just happened to me anyway? it looked like a dream but it felt like reality.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{it's the morphine trevor. you're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.}
<A>__{terevors quickly recalls the accident. fearing the worst.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{where's kirsty? where's my wife?}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{your wife...?}
<A>__{an older doctor walks in. ambrose. he gives trevor an icy look, then looks at trevor's chart.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(to ambrose)}
<D>__{still a little hazy. he's still in pain too, even after the morphine. i recommend we admit him. at least for another day...}
<P>__{(leaning in, sotto)}
<D>__{he just asked for his wife...}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{well i can't find any abnormalities. i think we're ready for discharge.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{but, dr. ambrose }
<C>__{ambrose}
<P>__{(looking up at trevor)}
<D>__{i think it's time to ween you off these painkillers too. wouldn't want you to develop a dependency to them. you might do things like come to the hospital for no reason other than to get a fix, wouldn't you?}
<A>__{ambrose gives trevor a fatherly smile then exits, not even looking at allison. allison watches him go, then turns back to trevor... then smiles perkily.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{well looks like you're going home! hope you brought your bus pass.}
