<A>__{fiery gypsy violin music as we move through clouds to reveal a massive ice canyon, and just around a bend, the incredible hidden fortress of north, aka santa claus.}
<L>__{interior north's workshop dusk}
<A>__{we glimpse a familiar looking red jacket and cap with white trim on a coat hanger just as a pair of tongs slam a block of ice onto a stone work table in quick cuts: a chainsaw shears the block in half, spraying ice. north lifts up the chainsaw revealing a massive tatoo on his arm, the word naughty clearly visible. three elves huddle in a doorway around a plate of cookies, each licking their own tasty morsel.}
<C>__{north }
<D>__{still waiting for cookies!}
<A>__{as north crosses the background, the elves lower the cookies from their mouths, their faces frozen in fear. the elves duck out of the way as north launches himself across the floor on his rolling chair close as his huge hand gropes furiously among his work tools, finally grabbing a miniature hammer. as north's humming along with his music, delicately chiseling into the ice, we see a second arm sleeve tatoo, the word nice clearly visible his intense blue eye magnified in a jeweler's eyepiece a delicate sculpting tool cuts fine details into the ice his hands place the finished piece on a curving ice track: an ice locomotive. it belches ice vapor and chugs down the track, picking up speed }

<D>__{ah, finally!}
<A>__{he takes a bite and leans toward the ice track. he chuckles as the train hits a loop, and launches off a ramp into midair then wings unfold jet engines sprout and ignite and the train lifts off the track suddenly, the door is thrown open by one of north's concerned yetis, sending the flying ice locomotive skidding across the floor in pieces.}

<D>__{arghbal...}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{ach!}
<A>__{the yeti cries out covering his mouth in shame. north cries out, devastated. the yeti, equally emotional, lets out another whimper. north looks down at the broken toy and takes a moment to collect himself.}
