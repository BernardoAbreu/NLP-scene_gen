<A>__{barris and debbie are having sex, sort of mechanical. they're plowing through, kind of like sawing through their steaks. when it's over, they both just lie there.}
<L>__{interior debbie's living room night}
<A>__{young barris, in his underwear, sits alone in the semi darkness and stares out the window. the front door unlocks and a woman enters, backlit from the hallway. she turns on the light. this is penny pacino, eighteen, a beatnik in a black leotard and skirt and black mascara. she has red hair. she sees barris on the couch.}

<C>__{barris}
<D>__{um, no thanks.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{thirsty?}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{if you have a beer.}
<A>__{penny returns with two beers, hands one to barris. she sits in a chair across from him. they both drink.}
<C>__{penny}
