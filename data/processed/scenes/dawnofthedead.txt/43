<A>__{on the roof, roger struggles under the dead weight of the young man. he tries to free himself and his weapons. shots ring out. a handful of black and puerto rican youngsters charge about the rooftop. another s.w.a.t. patrol appears from behind a large elevator housing. the young civilians retreat. several are mowed down. another bullet smashes against the dead s.w.a.t. man's back. just as roger frees himself, a bullet catches him squarely in the chest, but his armour takes the impact. he is thrown back off balance, and he struggles to catch his wind as he scrambles over to recover his weapon which skitters away across the roof top. before he reaches the gun, he is cut off by the looming figure of one of the black youths, pistol in hand. roger freezes. the young man aims his hand gun, but hesitates. a sudden barrage of bullets rips through the young black and he falls in a pool of blood. it was wooley's gun that killed him.}
