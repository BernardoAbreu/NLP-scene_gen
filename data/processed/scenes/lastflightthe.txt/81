<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the back seat of the taxi cab moments later as the cab jolts down an uneven street and drives slowly through the crowded carnival, the music continues. cary and shep sit on either side of nikki. cary is as edgy as shep is subdued.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{did you see the way francis poured lead into that fellow?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{fast work.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{fast? chain lightning!}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{nice shooting.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{those slugs went right past my ear. if i'd've moved an inch, i would've caught one of them myself.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{"sudden death," all right.}
<A>__{nikki takes out a cigarette.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{what's the matter with you, shep? i've never known you so quiet before.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{that's right. i am kind of quiet.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(holds her unlit cigarette)}
<D>__{not smoking?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{your lighter working?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{good ol', nikki never has any matches.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{as shep puts his hand in his inside jacket pocket to pull out his cigarette lighter, a strange look crosses his face.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{sure you want a light?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{that's what i want, a light.}
<A>__{shep pulls out the lighter and flicks it on revealing bloodstains on his white shirt. nikki stares down at the blood in horror.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{shep. shep!}
<A>__{nikki jumps up and moves away from shep, into a seat opposite.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{shep's hurt!}
<A>__{cary turns to shep, who slumps back weakly against his seat with a strange look of release and satisfaction on his face.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{it's a forgery.}
<A>__{cary examines shep, reaching in to feel his bloody wound.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{do something for him, cary! oh, shepard!}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{he's been shot!}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what can we do, cary?! what can we do?!}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{shep, why didn't you say you were hurt?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{good old cary. sweet nikki. you may not believe it but this is the best thing that ever happened to me.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{oh, shep, shep, don't say that. you'll be all right. we'll get you to a hospital.}
<A>__{shep puts a hand on cary's arm as the taxi continues to jolt along down the street.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{no, no, cary. don't rush me anywheres. let's sit here for a while. the hurts, the jolting.}
<A>__{urgently, cary reaches over and bangs on the glass between themselves and the cab driver.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{stop! stop!}
<A>__{in front of the carnival's slowly revolving carousel, the cab rolls to a stop. the carousel music drifts in. shep hardly moves head back, blank eyes staring, voice dreamy and weak. cary puts his face close to shep's, listening intently.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{that's better. you know, cary, i feel just like we're falling long time ago. do you remember? spinning ... spinning ... spinning. only you brought me down safe. oh, cary. good old cary.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{best flyer in the service.}
<A>__{nikki, seated opposite, is distraught.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, shepard, shepard, darling.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(reassuring)}
<D>__{we're gonna make a safe landing again, shep.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{not this time, cary. ol' shep's gonna crash.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{say, but we're spinning fast. level off. cary, level off.}
<A>__{shep's head slumps down. his face presses against cary's shoulder.}
<C>__{nikki's voice}
<D>__{oh, shepard, shepard, darling.}
<A>__{cary can't look at him. eyes wide, cary slowly presses his cheek to shep's.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{shep? shep?! shep!}
<A>__{cary looks as if he is on the verge of tears. and yet he cannot bring himself to cry.}
