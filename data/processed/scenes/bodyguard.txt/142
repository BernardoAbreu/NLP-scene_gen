<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{that's true, isn't it?}

<A>__{frank gets up smiling and takes some dishes into the kitchen.}
<C>__{herb}
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{i don't care. i'm proud of that.}
<P>__{(to rachel)}
<D>__{anyway, he's ten years old and he's just started playing tackle football. he comes to me and tells me he's afraid of getting hit, right? and he thinks it's because i never hit him. 'why don't you ever hit me?' he says to me!}
