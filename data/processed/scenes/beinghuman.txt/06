<L>__{exterior hillside day}
<A>__{hector shoves his children in one direction up the slope further into the hills. his woman runs off the other way. a hasty, confused argument takes place.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{up the hill!}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{no, down onto the other beach. the little ones can't take the hill. neither can i.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{up the hill! they're down there already. i saw them!}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{you're wrong!}
<A>__{she runs off down the slope. hector has no choice but to follow her, herding the children in front of him. deirdre runs on, heading for the lower slope and the cover of some trees. then from these same trees she sees the figures of the raiders coming toward her. she turns, running back up the hill. hector and the children also turn and run back the way they have come, by now dropping precious bits of food and other possessions. the raiders are running strongly, five or six of them. the little girl starts to go back for a precious toy she has dropped. hector picks her up and carries her off over his shoulder. the boy follows. deirdre is trailing behind them. she was right. she doesn't have the stamina for the hill. hector looks back and sees the raiders gaining on her. his face is a con fusion of fear and indecision. he almost stops, as if to go back and help her, but then changes his mind and runs off once again with the children. deirdre is by now throwing the things she is carrying at her pursuers, hoping that they will stop to retrieve them and allow her to gain some ground. but they don't stop and the effort tires her even more. she attempts one final dash and then, all of her energy gone, she stops in her tracks and waits for her pursuers. the raiders break their run also and trot and finally walk, the distance between them and deirdre. hector is watching all of this over his shoulder, still running. he stops for a moment to watch deirdre being finally surrounded by the raiders. then he runs on.}
