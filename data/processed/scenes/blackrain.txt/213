<L>__{interior squad bay night}
<A>__{in contrast to the japanese police station it's chaos. cops are in every imaginable kind of dress, trash cans over flow, a handcuffed prisoner screams abuse to anyone who will listen.}
<B>__{the raiding party}
<A>__{a dozen men in all, are donning flak jackets and windbreakers with police and treasury stenciled on the back.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{walks in with two heavy bullet proof vests slung over his shoulder. he squeezes past the raiding party to find}
<B>__{ich}
<A>__{sitting at a desk, thumbing through a frommer's guide to new york city. nick drops one of the vests on the desk. it lands like a ton of bricks. ich continues to read. a sergeant walks in.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{saddle up. hard team in the first unit. conklin, your rmp awaits.}
<A>__{the cops and treasury men, grabbing their gear, head for the door. nick is struggling to get into his vest using one arm.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sure you want to come? probably better than the greyline tour.}
<A>__{ich stands up, shoves the guidebook in his back pocket. he helps nick fasten the strap in back.}
<C>__{ich}
<D>__{you wouldn't make it without me.}
<A>__{nick smiles, takes the frommer's out of ich's pocket and tosses it into the trash. nick hands him a shotgun, takes another one off the rack for himself. we watch from behind as the two men head down the long hallway toward the exit.}
<C>__{ich}
<D>__{think we'll get him, nick?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{we can't lose.}
<C>__{ich}
<D>__{how can you be so sure?}
<A>__{nick opens the door at the far end of the hallway. they step out into the sunlit rain.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{cause you're the biggest thing to hit this town since...}
<A>__{before nick can finish his line, the door slams shut behind them.}
