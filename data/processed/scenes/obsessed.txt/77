<A>__{beth goes into the adjoining bathroom. with a yawn, derek sits down at his computer and goes to e mail. he scans it and is instantly confused. dozens of e mails, all from the same sender: tempgirl. alittle fearful, derek pulls up the first e mail. it opens up to reveal a self taken photo of lisa looking sexy and inviting on a bed, smiling seductively and wearing skimpy lingerie that shows off her sexy body. nder her photo: see you in the new year. derek feels a jolt of panic. he deletes it, brings up the others. t's the same photo, lisa on the bed, over and over. derek stares at lisa on screen, feeling sick and invaded. he isn't aware of beth coming out of the bathroom behind him. she approaches as he continues to delete.}
