<L>__{interior pienaar's room cape town hotel night}
<A>__{room dark but for one small desk light. pienaar stands at the window, looking out across cape town. he is deep in thought. pienaar turns away from the window, goes to the desk, where, under one small light, we see "invictus", the poem mandela wrote out by hand. pienaar begins reading it. there is a soft knock at his door. pienaar goes to it, opens it. it is nerine, accompanied by a cop. pienaar nods at the cop, steps back so that nerine can enter. as soon as the door closes behind her, nerine says:}
<C>__{nerine}
<D>__{you know the best thing about you being the captain?}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{uh ... the honor?}

<D>__{uh uh. i need to be angry for tomorrow.}
<A>__{nerine takes a deep breath, nods, turns away and sees the poem on mandela's personal letterhead.}
<C>__{nerine}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{a poem. from the president.}
<C>__{nerine}
