<A>__{chang has just finished a meal with the cops including kim, daeng and phaiban. chang is just settling the bill when the three gunmen walk in. he looks up just as they open fire. an insane storm of led rains down on the room, shattering all the mirrors on the back wall, taking out two waitresses and covering the room with broken glass. chang hits the floor and starts to drag himself towards some cover. chang's men are completely pinned down. phaiban's been hit and his white shirt has turned dark red with blood. chang keeps edging towards where his jacket's hanging on a chair. in it, his pistol. the gunmen keep firing. as soon as a clip is finished, they pull it out and put a fresh one in and keep shooting. a stray bullet hits the waiter who knocks over the chair chang's jacket's on. it falls to the ground. with it, his pistol. he grabs it and returns fire, letting off four rounds. he takes gunman one. head shot, right between the eyes. gunman two sees this and sprays at chang but chang manages to dive to cover. he rolls and fires again, shooting gunman two in the chest three times. chang's out of ammo and needs to reload. gunman three's weapon jams. he drops his weapon and runs. before he's finished reloading his pistol, chang's after him. he sees phaiban. dead. daeng trying to stem the flow of blood from his chest. chang keeps running, determined not to lose his man.}
