<C>__{watts }
<D>__{you're david's owner. he has to obey you, right?}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{he's blocked my communications. he can't hear me. won't listen.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{but if you went to him, turned on your suit's loudspeakers, he'd have to hear you. he'd have to obey.}
<C>__{vickers}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{so we go. armed to the teeth and fast as we can.}
<A>__{the men exchange looks. nod. they're in. even vickers nods.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{where are chance and ravel?}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{i told them to keep working.}
<A>__{watts looks incredulously at shepherd and ray, the soldier who'd been guarding the worksite.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{you called your soldiers in and left them out there?}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{we needed the firepower here.}
<A>__{watts gives vickers a withering look and drops it.}

<D>__{glasse. you finish that project?}
<C>__{laboratory}
<A>__{glasse presents watts with his handiwork: her old pair of magnifying goggles, retrofitted with engineer lenses. the goggles sit on her forehead, lowering the lenses in front of her eyes and raising them again at her bidding. with the lenses lowered, watts sees like an engineer sees: visible heat auras and electromagnetic field lines, elaborate haloes around living things.}

<A>__{glasse seals a nervous looking vickers into a vacuum suit. glasse, watts, and stillwell are already suited up. stillwell stands guard at the airlock door with his carbine. glasse goes to put vickers's helmet on. she makes him wait.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{david's brain is readable. we have the equipment on board. we can salvage the terraforming data and the magellan's launch codes. in a pinch we don't need david's cooperation.}

<D>__{we just need his head.}
