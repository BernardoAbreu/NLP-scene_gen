<D>__{no that's what i know you were thinking.}
<A>__{before dulaney can start to protest she continues. she slowly walks behind him. dulaney stares straight ahead.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{how often do you make love to your wife, frank? once a week? sometimes twice? there once was passion, wasn't there? but now it's bland, predictable. tell me, when you do it do you always think of her? or do you wonder what it would be like to be with someone else? someone wild. someone who would force you to lose control.}
<A>__{her words strip his thoughts bare. he is vulnerable.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{there's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, frank.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you take a lot for granted.}
<A>__{dulaney starts for the door. rebecca's cool exterior fades, giving way to her vulnerable side.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{please stay, frank. i don't want to be alone. i don't expect anything from you no demands no complications. i just need to feel close to someone.}
<A>__{dulaney turns back towards her. a beat. he thinks for a moment, then walks back into the room. rebecca smiles warmly, invitingly.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i will be back in a minute. help yourself to a drink.}
<A>__{she disappears down the hall. dulaney stands were he is, wondering what he is doing there. he walks over to the bar and pours a scotch. he looks down the hall. his pov rebecca's bedroom the bedroom door is open. the room is dark lit only by the moon. rebecca slowly pulls her sweater off over her head. moonlight washes over her body, silhouetting her. she runs her hands lightly over her stomach working her way up to her round, full breasts. she stops for a moment and we sense she knows dulaney is watching her. dulaney stares at her mesmerized. he knows he should turn away, but he cannot control the urge that moves him to look. one by one rebecca unsnaps the buttons of her jeans, revealing her sheer, white panties. she bends forward slightly and slowly peels the jeans down to her ankles then steps out of them. we can see the desire on dulaney's face. he looks away. the conflict inside him grows. he looks back. rebecca walks into the hall. she is barefoot wearing a long, slinky dress her eyes catch dulaney's. if she wasn't aware he was watching her before she is now. it doesn't seem to bother her. she moves towards him slowly her eyes inviting his. dulaney moves towards her. they meet in the middle of the room. she waits he moves closer so close that he can smell her. she cranes her neck back, subtly tempting him to bring his lips to hers. the longing overcomes him. he kisses her lightly the kiss lingers for a moment, then she grabs him forcefully by the hair, arching his head back. she bites his lip.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{my way.}
<A>__{dulaney ignores her. he tries to kiss her again. she turns her head away. she walks down the hall into the bedroom and closes the door. dulaney follows. he tries the door it's locked. he starts to knock stops turns and walks back into the living room. he starts to leave stops. he looks at the bedroom door. his passion builds his hunger for her devours him. he moves quickly down the hall eyes filled with determination. he breaks the door open with his shoulder. rebecca is standing in the center of the room as if waiting for him. he moves to her. she can see the fire in his eyes. he takes her in his arms kisses her neck feverishly feeding his craving for her.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{my way.}
<A>__{he is lost within her now and doesn't hear her. she pulls his hair, jerking his head back. her eyes command him to follow her demand. something in him snaps a new door opens. he pushes her back onto the dressing cabinet. he kisses her, running his hand up her thighs, hiking up her dress. she wraps her legs around his waist. they move along the cabinet knocking jars and bottles to the floor. he lifts her carries her to the bed lays her down and rips her dress from her body. their passion is unleased. they grope and claw for one another hungrily. she pulls his shirt off and bites him on the shoulder. his face tenses from the pain, but he moans with pleasure.}
