<L>__{int gasthof night}
<A>__{victor and henry slouched at their regular table writes in his thick, well worn leather journal.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{the entire school heard it. it wasn't something one could miss.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you're a comfort to me, henry.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what now? writing about it in your journal won't help.}
<C>__{victor}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{it's a letter to my father.}
<A>__{henry falls silent. victor closes the journal, winds it secure with its leather thong, jams it deep in the outer pocket of his greatcoat. brooding. the bell above the door jingles. a gust of wind sweeps in. they glance up. professor waldman enters, dapper and soft spoken, impeccably courteous. he murmurs a pleasantry to the innkeeper and drifts over to victor's table.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{professor waldman.}
<C>__{waldman}
<P>__{(takes a seat)}
<D>__{victor, explain yourself.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{krempe has a way of provoking my temper.}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{you have a way of provoking his.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i've been watching you. you seem impatient with your studies.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{to say the least. i came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. all we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{you disdain accepted wisdom?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{no, i embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(mutters to waldman)}
<D>__{now you've got him started.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{these are exciting times, henry. we're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. look at edward jenner. he wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. i've heard this speech before.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{but you haven't listened, never in history has so much seemed possible. we're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{i understand your frustration. i was young once myself.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{walk me home. something i'd like to show you.}
