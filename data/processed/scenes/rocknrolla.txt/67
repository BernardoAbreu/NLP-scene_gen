<C>__{pete}
<D>__{my dad made me watch bonanza every sunday after church.}
<C>__{johnny story}
<D>__{that's got to have done some damage, all those guns and cowboys.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you think? it wasn't all bad, he sometimes made me laugh too.}
<C>__{johnny story}
<D>__{now we're getting somewhere. did he interfere with you? you know, touch you inappropriate like?}

<D>__{pedro's dad's a tickling monster!}
<A>__{johnny helps himself to some wasters drink at the bar for a quick refreshment. understandably, the waster doesn't look happy and his three friends don't look happy either.}
<C>__{waster}
<D>__{that's my drink.}
<A>__{johnny gives the waster and his friends the masturbation signal without even bothering to look at them.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{fuck you singalong, you're no help and stop calling me pedro.}
<A>__{the waster grabs a bottle from the bar ready to take some action. johnny grabs a pencil from his top pocket, he holds it out like it's a knife. it's almost a joke.}
<C>__{johnny story}
<D>__{come on boy, i will have you and ya girlfriends! i will do the lot of yazz.}
<A>__{the waster is lost. johnny is not physically scary, he's only scary because he's quite clearly mad. he looks like robert deniro in taxi driver, mad as mars, he catches himself in the mirror, he likes what he sees. ciggy falling out of his mouth, he sort of takes the piss out of himself, smiles "tough johnny," the waster backs off he doesn't want junkie madness.}

<C>__{johnny story }
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{i find that profoundly offensive pedro. two's up on a snout to show i care.}
<A>__{he pulls out a ciggy. pete takes it.}
<C>__{pete}
