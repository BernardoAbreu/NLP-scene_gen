<L>__{interior cole's bedroom afternoon}
<A>__{lynn moves into cole's room with the laundry basket balanced on her hip. the walkman headphones on her head blares a muffled techno dance beat. lynn starts picking clothes up around cole's room. this bedroom is an eerie place. the shadows seem to make shapes and figures. all the furniture is wood old fashioned. the lamps, the paintings on the wall antiques as well. the most striking feature of the room, however, is the homemade tent created from bedsheets and blankets tied to chairs and bureaus. it takes up a large corner of the room. a sign hangs over the bedsheets.}
<D>__{"do not enter"}
<A>__{lynn grabs the spiderman p.j.s that drape over the tent. a german shepherd puppy sleeps on the pillow. sebastian lifts his head sleepily and peers at lynn before returning to his slumber. lynn slowly reaches for a picture frame that peeks out from under cole's pillow. slides it out... it's a vacation photo of a couple. lynn and cole and a man. the man looks in every way a larger version of cole. the picture has a visible effect on lynn. she lets out a shaky breath before returning the photo to its hiding place. lynn pulls a pair of school uniform pants off the wooden roll cover desk next to the bed. the desk is covered with loose leaf papers filled with writings. lynn's eyes are drawn to the papers. her curious gaze turns serious. her mouth opens a tiny bit involuntarily. the papers are strewn with lines of handwriting. countless lines. thousands of words... some horizontal, some vertical... the writing moves in arcs and flows in various size written at great speed every word connected by a single pen stroke everything written in one continuous motion. lynn slowly spins the papers, taking in some of the phrases... ...christ break the freaking glass oh no god no what the hell is going on quiet the damn baby i will cut you i swear it someone stop the burning i will kill you i will kill all you bastard... the words go on and on. lynn removes her hands from the paper. she pulls her headphones off slowly.}
