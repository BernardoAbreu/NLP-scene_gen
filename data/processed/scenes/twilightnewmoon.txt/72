<L>__{exterior jacob's house (continuous) day}
<A>__{ behind jacob stand sam uley, jared, paul and embry. they're oblivious to the rain, wear minimal clothes.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you cut your hair.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{go away.}
<A>__{jacob turns away. sam leads the group toward the house. jacob follows. she, and we, note his sure footed strides; his awkward growth spurt disappeared overnight. she grabs his arm.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<A>__{he stops, turns back. the others wait on the porch for him. they're out of earshot, but won't leave him alone with her.}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(lowers her voice)}
<D>__{i can help.}
<A>__{his face is hard as he shakes his head. he's not talking.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{sam got to you. what did he do?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{sam's trying to help me, don't blame him.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{then who?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(bitterness seething)}
<D>__{how `bout those filthy, reeking bloodsuckers you love? the cullens.}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(thrown)}
<D>__{i... don't know what you're }
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you know exactly what i'm talking about.}
<A>__{he's shaking, almost convulsing with anger. she regroups.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{the cullens are long gone. how are they to blame?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{they started all this by existing. goddamn leeches }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{jacob.}
<A>__{jacob glances at sam, who gives him a look. jacob takes a breath, trying to calm himself.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i can't be friends with you anymore.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{jake, i know i hurt you. i should have been more up front but i needed you, i still do. i don't know what that means yet, but if you give me time }
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{stop. don't. it's not you }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{ "it's not you, it's me?" god.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it's true. i'm not... good.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you're wrong }
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. this is over }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i can't take losing my best friend, too.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you already have }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{don't say that you promised }
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{go home, bella. don't come back.}
<A>__{he practically runs away, joining the gang who all disappear inside. off bella, standing in the rain...}
