<L>__{interior hospital room night}
<A>__{jacob opens his eyes. he's in bed, dressed in a white smock. a doctor stands next to him with a clipboard in hand.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{just relax, everything's fine.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{that's what you say...}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{you're lucky you're here instead of juvenile hall. you put up quite a fight. but you're clean. no traces of drugs or alcohol in your blood.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i could've told you that.}
<A>__{jacob starts getting out of bed.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{hold on there.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you said i was fine. i have to get back. my friends are in trouble.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i said you weren't on drugs, but i never said you were fine. you're suffering from extreme fatigue and stress that manifested itself into one hell of an anxiety attack. at least that's what we hope it is. you had a major seizure, jacob.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you don't understand. this whole town is in danger.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{we're keeping you here for observation. you're not going anywhere tonight.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you can't do that. you don't have the right!}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{yes we do. your temporary guardian, mr. ross, signed all the papers. if you're okay in the morning we might let you go home. until then, you're bed bound.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{but...}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{we took off the restraints. do you want us to put them back on?}
<A>__{jacob drops back in bed. the doctor goes to the door and turns out the lights.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{sleep.}
<A>__{he closes the door behind him...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{shit...}
<A>__{and we hear it lock}
