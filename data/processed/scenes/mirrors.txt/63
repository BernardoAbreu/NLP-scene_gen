<A>__{the camera flashes illuminate the crime scene. angela's body lies afloat in the bathtub. the apartment is entirely flooded. two men in police uniforms close off a security zone, to keep the intrusive neighbors away. a detective is interrogating an old puerto rican couple the downstairs neighbors. they were the ones who alerted the police, after having noticed the water leakage. the old woman explains how "it was raining blood into her living room"... amongst the police officers and the legal medical squad, we find larry. he is in charge of the case. leaning over the bathtub, larry examines the visible parts of the corpse. angela's face is concealed by her own long black hair, floating in the murky water. larry slips on an examination glove, pulls up his sleeve and sinks his arm into the blood red bath. he feels around for the chain of the plug in order to drain the bathtub. the water level begins to recede, gradually revealing angela's naked corpse. with the tip of his fingers, larry lifts away the few strands of hair covering angela's face taken by surprise, he steps back from the horrifying sight of this jaw less face. larry removes his glove, wipes off his bloodied arm and starts to leave the bathroom when something else catches his attention he comes closer to the spiderweb cracked medicine cabinet mirror. a tiny drop of blood is dripping from one of the cracks. strange. a dark silhouette passes behind him in the reflection. he turns immediately the bloodied bathroom is still and silent. angela's destroyed body lies in the empty bathtub. a police inspector in the next room, calls out to him }
