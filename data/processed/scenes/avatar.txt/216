<A>__{the omaticaya people lift their voices in a song filled with tragic loss and yearning for deliverance. close on neytiri, singing. a shadow crosses her face. she looks up, and her eyes go wide as a terrible cry echoes, turning all eyes skyward. an enormous shadow covers the crowd as toruk comes out of the sun, beating its huge wings to slow its descent. its crimson and black wings, backlit by the sun, seem to glow from within. the people cry out in alarm and scatter as the dreaded beast alights in their midst. and that's when they see jake, riding high on its shoulders, plugged in to its antenna. it folds its wings and stands calmly amid the paralyzed na'vi. toruk lowers its body. they stare in awe as jake dismounts and strokes the magnificent animal's flank. neytiri, tsu'tey and mo'at watch in stunned amazement as the legendary rider of last shadow walks toward them.}
