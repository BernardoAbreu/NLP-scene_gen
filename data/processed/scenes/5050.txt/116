<D>__{we were successful in the extraction of the tumor. however, as you can imagine, with something of this magnitude...there were some unforeseen complications. the bone corrosion was much greater than initially anticipated. we had to remove part of the hip and pelvis, as well as most of the psoas muscle. we also had to remove a good amount of sheath tissue around the sciatic nerve, the damage to that nerve is considerable, which is going to hinder his ability to walk...he's in stable condition right now, but it's touch and go.}
