<L>__{interior palace throne room night}
<A>__{to our great surprise, commodus is not raging. he sits quietly on the polished marble floor in front of a model of the colosseum. he moves model pieces around in the colosseum, planning his festival. lucilla stands, tense.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{why is he still alive?}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{he shouldn't be alive. that vexes me. i am terribly vexed...}
<A>__{lucilla watches her brother cautiously, expecting the explosion. he carefully moves some model pieces in the arena.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{there, that's better. do you like the platform here?}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{mmm.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{i do too. simple, elegant...}
<A>__{lucilla is growing more and more unnerved at commodus' unusual serenity.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{father would have wanted something more ornate but he's dead now.}
<A>__{a beat. commodus laughs. a beat.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{maximus meridas haunts me. i see father turning away from me and gazing at him. how many times did i suffer that indignity, i wonder?}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{what are you going to do?}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{i'm going to kill him.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(glances at her)}
<D>__{oh, you're too clever, sister. don't tell me part of you won't weep for him.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{when he defies my brother the emperor, he defies me. but you shouldn't send assassins.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{the people embraced him today. they will be expecting his next match...}
<P>__{(she kneels next to him)}
<D>__{... let him die in the arena like the slave he is. let the people see what comes of defying caesar.}
<A>__{a beat as he looks at her.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{he wounded you deeply, didn't he? long ago.}
<A>__{she does not answer.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{nonetheless, your political acumen is, as always, unerring.}
<A>__{he picks up a model tiger and puts it in the arena. he looks at the model tiger and smiles.}
