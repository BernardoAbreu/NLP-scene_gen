<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior regis & kathie lee show set}
<A>__{we hear a music bite from "le freak."}
<C>__{kathie lee}
<D>__{and now back to the exciting conclusion of ricky coogan's incredible story.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{well, let's see, the other freaks were lined up in elijah's sights, and i was about to shove a pipe through stuey's skull, when all of a sudden, i heard a voice...}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior carnival tent night}
<A>__{rick stops the spear inches from stuey's chest. their eyes meet.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{kill him! kill him!}
<A>__{elijah's bloodthirsty goading fades away, and cowboy's voice reverberates in rick's head.}
<C>__{cowboy }
<D>__{i reckon that troll could help you if you just let him into your heart... your heart... your heart...}
<A>__{the voice keeps echoing. a tear wells up in rick monster's eye. he looks over at cowboy, who is actually calling out to him from the cage.}
<C>__{cowboy}
<D>__{your heart... your heart... your heart...}
<A>__{rick monster loses his murderous glare. he breaks into a warm smile, throws the pipe away and helps stuey monster up. they hug. the rest of the freaks cheer wildly.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{atta' boy coog!}
<P>__{(nudges worm)}
<D>__{hey, ain't that somethin'?}
<A>__{the worm is gushing sentimentally. he tries to hide his tears.}
<C>__{worm}
<D>__{tosh. (sniff) sentimental claptrap}
<P>__{(sniff) shameless, maudlin baaa!}
<A>__{he can't hold it in anymore. he bawls like a baby. meanwhile, elijah is hopping mad.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{cut the lovey dovey bullshit, and start mutilating each other!}
<A>__{he aims at rick monster and presses the fire button. the glop starts to flow, but before it can make it out of the tip, rick grabs hold of the nozzle, and twists it around to face elijah.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{raarrrrrrgh!}
<A>__{elijah manages to duck just in time. a stream of yellow noxon 25 glop flies over his shoulder, and lands in the dunk tank full of carbolic acid that sits off to one side of the tent. the acid and the noxon mix together and bubble up menacingly. elijah hops down out of the gunner's chair and squares off against rick monster. meanwhile, stuey monster has released the other freaks from the cage. they watch the confrontation from a distance. elijah rolls up his sleeves. rick growls and advances slowly.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{you think i made you strong? ha! i've cranked my dna up so high, you won't know what hit you. i'm a wrecking machine! aaaaaaa!}
<A>__{he rushes at rick and delivers a flurry of punches to his mid section. they have absolutely no effect. rick brings one heavy fist slamming down on elijah's head, stopping him cold.}
<C>__{elijah}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{ow! i think you crushed my spinal cord. i can't feel anything in my fingers.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{maybe you'll feel this ...}
<A>__{rick rears back to kick him.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{qait if you kill me, you'll never find the antidote.}
<A>__{the freaks all perk up. rick's skeptical.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{what antidote?}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{a time release serum i baked it into a delicious batch of macaroons.}
<A>__{a slow smile grows on the freaks' faces, especially rick's.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{if you ask me, you skimped on the coconut!}
<A>__{thwak! rick boots elijah between the legs, sending him flying through the air. he lands on the dunk tank seat over the bubbling noxon acid. dazed, he looks at the bullseye target, and back at rick. summoning up his last ounce of bravado, elijah makes a last stand.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{come on, coogan! come oooon! you haven't got the guts to kill me! go on! i dare ya'!}
<A>__{rick ponders for a second. he looks over to julie. then...}
<C>__{scrappy}
<D>__{yap! yap!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{scrappy!}
<A>__{scrappy the dog rushes in. he leaps up and presses the bullseye, dropping elijah into the hideous mixture.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{aaaaaaaarrrrrrggggghhhh!}
<A>__{elijah struggles in agony. his body bubbles and mutates in the thick toxic soup. he sinks lower and lower into the gunk, until he and his cries are buried for good. scrappy leaps into rick's arms and licks his face.}
<C>__{scrappy}
<D>__{yap!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{atta boy, scrap!}
<A>__{blam! blam! the tent flaps fly open and a half dozen fbi agents rush in with guns drawn.}
<C>__{fbi chief}
<D>__{freeze, fbi!}
<A>__{another fbi guy investigates the dunk tank, sees elijah's hat floating on top of the bubbling ooze.}
<C>__{another fbi guy}
<D>__{looks like they took care of skuggs, chief.}
<A>__{the chief nods. they put away their guns, and approach rick and the rest of the jubilant freaks.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{nice work, ricky. you'll get a medal from the vice president for this.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{great. but how did you }
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{we've been following skuggs for years. scrappy just filled in some of the details.}
<C>__{scrappy}
<D>__{yap!}
<C>__{fbi chief}
<D>__{thank heavens you brought him to justice, rick. god only knows how far his sick plans would've gone.}
<C>__{another fbi guy}
<D>__{hey chief, look at this!}
<A>__{the fbi guy has peeled the decal off the pepsi machine, revealing that it's actually a coke machine! the chief is sickened to the core.}
<C>__{fbi chief}
<D>__{is nothing sacred?}
<A>__{suddenly, the agents are distracted by a terrible scream. they turn to the dunk tank and are shocked by what they see.}
<C>__{fbi chief}
<D>__{oh, my lord!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{no! it can't be!}
<A>__{we swish pan over to reveal a dripping blob climbing out of the dunk tank. the blob separates into two distinct entities with their backs to us. they turn around and...my god it's... it's.... regis and kathie lee! or at least a damn fine mutant imitation of them. call him them elijus and elly lee. they both have glowing red demon eyes and speak in elijah's voice.}
<C>__{elijus}
<D>__{thought you killed me, huh?}
<C>__{elly lee}
<D>__{what the hell are you looking at?}
<C>__{fbi chief}
<D>__{two pieces of deadmeat!}
<A>__{blam! blam! blam! the fbi guys open fire. we show only the horrified reactions of the freaks as they look on.}
