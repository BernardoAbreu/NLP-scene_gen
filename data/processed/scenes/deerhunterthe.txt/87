<A>__{merle turns away from the "pits". he looks down at sal, then he looks at nick. his expression is one of exasperation, as if he had been having a long argument.}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{i'm telling you, nick, no one's going to come.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what are you, god?}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{listen, asshole, it's up to us!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{they bombed last night, right? didn't they bomb? if they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. they could be up there right now!}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{what are you, hoping?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what else?}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{i thought you might be praying.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm doing that too.}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{i suppose you wish you were somewhere else?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{nick, you're wasting your time... listen to me! you're wasting your time! this is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! this is it. here we are... and we gotta get out!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you're right... okay, you're right.}
<C>__{merle}
<P>__{(grabs him)}
<D>__{get off your ass, nick. get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(stands)}
<D>__{okay, okay!}
<P>__{(he straightens his shoulders)}
<D>__{okay. okay, you're right... what about sal?}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{forget sal.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{i mean forget sal... sal can't take it, nick.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{forget sal?}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{forget sal... listen to me forget sal! i've been working on sal since dawn, nick. sal's in a dream and he won't come out. listen!!! from here on you gotta go for you. you hear me? for you!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{merle...}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{listen, nick! get it through your head or you and me are both dead too!}
<A>__{a shout comes from the thatched hut. the south vietnamese whip around in fright. merle and nick turn. through the bars of the "tiger cage" we see the v.c. guards coming down from the thatched hut. the guards are all drinking beer again and the guard in charge is waving the pearl handled revolver. nick looks at merle. the sight has totally unnerved him.}
<C>__{merle }
<P>__{(calm)}
<D>__{we gotta play with more bullets.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{we what?}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{we gotta play with more bullets, nick. it's the only way.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{more bullets in the gun?}
<C>__{merle}
<P>__{(even)}
<D>__{more bullets in the gun... the trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(numb)}
<D>__{with more bullets?... against each other?... are you crazy!!! are you fucking nuts!!!}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{nick... nick!!! it's the only chance we've got!}
<A>__{nick stares at merle. rain is pouring off them in rivulets and the voices of the approaching guards are getting louder.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{how many bullets?}
<C>__{merle}
<P>__{(watching him)}
<D>__{three bullets minimum.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(panic)}
<D>__{no way. no fucking way!}
<C>__{merle}
<P>__{(evenly, holding him with his eyes)}
<D>__{i will pick the moment, nick. the game goes on until i move. when i start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no. no way!}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{when you get the ak, open up. you got me? open up.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{you're crazy!!!... no way!... now you're crazy!!! you're completely crazy!!!}
<A>__{the guards begin screaming orders from outside the cage and one of them lets off a blast of automatic rifle fire which shreds the bamboo roof just above the prisoners' heads. nick and merle grab sal and drag him to the door.}
