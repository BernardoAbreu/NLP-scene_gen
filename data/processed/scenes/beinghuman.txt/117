<L>__{exterior mass day}
<A>__{on a headland overlooking the bay, father diogo's mass is in progress. every fit member of the camp is there, and a good many of the sick have been carried in litters to take part. the harmonium has been carried up the hill and is in full voice, some youths dissipating their precious energy on its bellows. the younger boys have been organized into a choir. the large cross stands behind father diogo, held in place by a cairn of piled stones at its base. when we find hector there is something tantalizingly familiar about it all; the cliffs, the ocean, the kneeling hector, a pile of stones, the offering to a god.}
