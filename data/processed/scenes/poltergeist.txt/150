<A>__{ryan has heard and starts to gently take up the slack. when it is taut he is fed the rope one inch at a time.}
<L>__{interior children’s bedroom night}
<A>__{the flag is disappearing into the vibrant light inside the closet. tangina counts off inches as her lipstick calibrations click off into the void.}
<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{the flag appears from the air in the center of the string opening. the calibrations follow...}
<C>__{ryan}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{it’s through! it’s through!}
<L>__{interior children’s bedroom night}
<A>__{diane transfers the information.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{stop it’ through!}
<A>__{tangina looks at the last calibration.}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{only thirty six inches wide, not much room. here, tie this end around my waist.}
<A>__{a look of horror crosses diane’s face.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{what do you think you’re doing?}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{i’m going in after her!}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{she won’t come to you. let me go.}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{you’ve never done this before!}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{neither have you!}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{i never wanted to! i still don’t!}
<A>__{diane steps into the room, blasted back by two several gusts of wind aimed specifically at her. steve has already started to tie the rope around his own waist. he’s decided to go.}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{you can’t. who’s going to hold this end?!}
<A>__{steve realizes it’s true. diane pulls the rope from steve and secures it around her waist. steve ties two clove hitches and faces his wife.}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(above the wind)}
<D>__{i love you!}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i love you!}
<A>__{they kiss, part, and steve and tangina get a hold of the end of the rope. dr. lesh runs into the storm and helps to hold.}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{no, no! go down and help ryan pull, but only when i say so! only when i say!}
<A>__{dr. lesh runs downstairs and diane takes one look back at steve.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{don’t let go, you guys!}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{never!}
<A>__{another angle closet and diane she moves into it... the light swallowing her. tangina watches the calibrations and stops feeding when the indications are that diane is in the center of the infinite void.}
