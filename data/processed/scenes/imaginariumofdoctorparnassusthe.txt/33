<L>__{ext side of black friars' bridge moments later}
<A>__{anton is `absailing' over the side of the bridge. one end of a rope is tied around his waist, the other is attached to the bridge parapet. a lantern dangles from his waist. valentina and percy watch anton's perilous descent. moments later there are two bodies hanging from the bridge, the mysterious hanging man's and anton's. the man is hanging by a noose around his neck, still jerking in his dance of death. his hands are tied behind his back. anton can't reach the man.}

<D>__{hurry up.}
<A>__{anton shoots percy and valentina a jaundiced look and with valentina's help on her end of the rope begins to swing back and forth. eventually, with a big enough swing, he manages to hook his foot around the hanging man who has gone limp. dead. with extreme difficulty and great discomfort, anton pulls the man close to him, takes a knife from his pocket and cuts the man's rope. anton and the man are now swinging back and forth together on anton's rope which is threatening to cut anton in half.}
