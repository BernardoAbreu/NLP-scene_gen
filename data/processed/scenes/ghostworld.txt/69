<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{that was great jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{oh i love to cook. i guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but i believe you should trust your instincts. when i talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... i don't know... harmless. ready for ice cream?}
<A>__{dana heads for the kitchen. seymour gets up to relieve his backache. he walks over to a framed photo on the wall.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{here we are... it's mocha mint from lickety splits. oh, isn't that photograph just heart rending?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{yeah ... where is this? bosnia?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{was it bosnia? i forget...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{a soul funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. she goes over and turns it up.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{oh, i just love this song! isn't it great? doesn't it make you want to dance? c'mon!}
<C>__{seymour}

<C>__{dana}
<D>__{c'mon seymour, it's all in your mind. just loosen up and feel the music! here, put down your bowl of ice cream.}
<A>__{she takes his ice cream and puts it on a table.}
<C>__{seymour}

<C>__{dana}
<D>__{oh, all right... party pooper! just let me put a few things away.}
<A>__{she shuts off the stereo as he sits and eats his ice cream.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{i'm so excited to see this film dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! did you see his last film, the flower that drank the moon? it was simply glorious!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{uh, no. i missed that one. but what do i know? i like laurel and hardy movies.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{really? i never really cared for those. why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?}
