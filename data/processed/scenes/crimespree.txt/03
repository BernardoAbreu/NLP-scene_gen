<L>__{exterior house night}
<A>__{a wealthy neighborhood of paris off the champs elysees. large homes line the secluded street. we see the silhouette of a man in a peugeot. we move in closer to see raymond gayet, 30's, waits nervously.}
<L>__{interior dark room night}
<A>__{dark. daniel foray lights his zippo lighter. he is late 30's, tall, handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the flame. beside him is julien labesse, 30's, hyper. daniel places the lighter on a small table and moves over to a painting on the wall. daniel stops at one, removes a pen knife and starts to cut the canvas from the frame. daniel rolls up the canvas.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{julien starts to pick up the zippo.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{be careful it's...}
<A>__{too late! julien has already picked it up. it burns his hand ans he flicks it away. it flies through the air and lands in the corner of the room. the curtains catch on fire.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{... hot!}
<A>__{julien panics! he grabs the canvas out of daniel's hand and begins beating the flames with it. daniel looks at him with disbelief. julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames. he turns to daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the fire, but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire. a beat. julien sees the flames and puts them out. daniel just stares at him. he opens the canvas. the painting is ruined.}
