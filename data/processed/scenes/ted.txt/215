<A>__{donny makes one final reach for ted. he grabs ted by the foot again, and pulls hard. with one great rrriiiiiip, ted tears into two pieces. as john watches in shock, ted falls through the air in slo motion, a shower of white stuffing descending with him. lori watches with a hand over her mouth. the two halves of ted land, along with the scattered white stuffing. donny, still hanging, stares down at the fallen teddy bear. he starts pulling himself back over the ledge. we lead and follow john as he runs back down through the stadium with desperate numbness. lori climbs over the edge of the seating area, and runs toward him as well. angle back on donny, who pulls himself back over into the upper seating area. he hears the sound of a cop siren, and peers over the edge of the stadium. seeing a cop car pull up far below, he makes a break for it. down below, ted's top half lies on the grass, looking around in a daze, like a badly wounded soldier for whom there is not much hope. john and lori race to his side, and kneel down.}
