<B>__{a series of closeups}
<A>__{images of a weapon being forged, all filtered through shimmering convection waves of intense heat. we see a hammer clanging down. the fires of a roaring furnace. sparks showering up from titanium slowly being given shape. molten silver. acid etching. and then we pull back to reveal }
<L>__{interior blade's workshop night}
<A>__{blade works before a forge by moonlight, his body dripping with sweat. he slips his hand in a protective glove and grips the red hot weapon, dousing it in a quench bucket. as a cloud of steam envelops blade, he lifts it up for view.}
<B>__{a new sword}
<A>__{perfect. lethal. wrought from titanium, plated in sliver. as blade inspects the sword, we hear his earlier words again:}
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{i am a hunter. a weapon. it's what i do. it's in my blood...}
<A>__{satisfied with his work, blade smiles }
