<L>__{interior inn evening}
<A>__{a lavish little supper chamber with coffered bed, fancy french furniture. open to rooftops of colonial city. louis sits by an open window looking out over the city. behind, we can hear the laughter of lestat and tow female voices. louis turns and sees lestat, in the main chamber with two drugged or drunked whores. one runs her finger down his chest. the other seems out of it.}
<D>__{whore #1 you're skin's icy.}
<C>__{lestat}

<C>__{louis}
<D>__{why do you do this lestat?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i like to do it. i enjoy it. take you aesthete's taste to purer things. kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! for now doubt, you are a killer louis. ah!}
