<A>__{jack comes out of the hotel, walks up the street.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{question: was he gambling, taking jani's money? answer: no. because he wasn't betting with his own money. he was being paid in advance for a service...}
<L>__{interior casino night}
<A>__{at the roulette table jack spins the wheel, throws the ball.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{in reality there were two clear elements of risk in this exchange. one: the possibility the cash was counterfeit. two: the possibility jani or her creditors would want the money back if the plan failed.}
<A>__{a middle aged man is sweating. he fingers his last 2 chips. he reaches for a number, hesitates. jack sees that the man's hand is shaking.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{to begin with he put the odds at 2 against. 7 for. he checked a random selection of bills at a bank. they were all good.}
<A>__{across the table a well dressed jewish woman in her fifties is sitting next to a young man, a gigolo type, the top three buttons of his shirt undone. she too hesitates with her bet, looks down at her card, marked with the last thirty turns.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{so now his odds were decidedly better. he put them at 8 to 1. the fact that the notes were good gave him one less negative. 2 minus 1. at the same time mathematically he had one more positive. 7 plus 1.}
<A>__{the woman looks up at the young man. she hands him the chip.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{bring me some luck.}
<A>__{the young man smiles. takes the chip and puts it on 21. the middle aged man puts his chips on 8 and 11. he prays silently.}
