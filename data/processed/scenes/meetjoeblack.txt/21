<L>__{interior salon, parrish townhouse, new york city night}
<A>__{a beautiful space adjacent to the dining room, it has a glass roof which offers a superb view of the manhattan sky line. the hour is before dinner: gathered on one side of the room are allison and parrish, on the other side drew and quince. coyle, a butler, and luisa, the housekeeper, pass hors d'oeuvres and drinks.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{...music, i know how you love music, daddy, and i want to have music that pleases you and of course doesn't put a thousand other people to sleep i've agonized over this and finally settled on sidney brown, twenty four men, very eclectic, plus i'm feathering in a latin sextet on their breaks tito puente, trini lopez zy, i forget their names }
<A>__{parrish has tuned allison out, he tried to stay with it, but his mind has wandered, the event of the day too much with him.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{you haven't heard a word, have you? i keep talking and all you do is nod like mr. himmelfass in the nutcracker.}
<A>__{parrish still doesn't answer.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{you don't care, do you?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what, honey?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{i lay awake nights in a cold sweat, i want this party to be like some thing mom would have made for you, i want it to be perfect }
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(attentive now)}
<D>__{i know you do, darling.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{and you could care less }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart. i can' tell you how much i appreciate it and how i'm looking forward to it.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{good. songs. what songs should sidney pancho and his six men we can forget about what songs do you think he should play?}
<A>__{a stab of pain, parrish discreetly grabs his upper arm but manages to keep his attention on allison.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{tell it to me again.}
<A>__{suddenly, the voice cuts in:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{...yes.}
<A>__{parrish's head snaps, startled by the sound.}
<P>__{voice (v.o., cont'd) (to parrish)}
<D>__{did you miss me?}
<A>__{parrish reacts once more, aware again he is the only one who has heard the voice, as an oblivious allison continues:}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{never mind. leave it to me.}
<A>__{parrish ignores her, his attention has been taken by the voice. his eyelids flutter, nonplused, edgy and fearful.}
<C>__{luisa}
<D>__{mr. parrish, dinner is served.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(to quince and drew, across the room)}
<D>__{chow time, you guys.}
<A>__{parrish is confounded. blindly and disconcerted, he follows allison and drew and quince.}
