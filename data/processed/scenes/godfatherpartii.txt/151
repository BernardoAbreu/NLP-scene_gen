<A>__{out to the yard, where we can see glimpses of little anthony playing by himself.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{i can't love a man like that; i can't live with him, i can't let him be father to my children. look.}
<A>__{the little boy, moodily by himself.}
<B>__{view on kay}
<A>__{obviously moved.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{he's not like a little boy... he doesn't talk to me; he doesn't want to play; he doesn't like other children, he doesn't like toys. it's as though he's waiting for the time he can take his father's place.}
<P>__{(almost in tears)}
<D>__{you know what he told me when he was four years old. he said he had killed his grandfather...}
<B>__{view on hagen}
<A>__{listening, calmly.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{... he said he had shot his grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden. and he asked me... he asked me, tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.}
<P>__{(she cries)}
<D>__{how does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{kay... kay...}
<B>__{view on kay}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{what kind of a family is this... are we human beings? he knows his father killed his uncle carlo. he heard connie.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{you don't know that's true. but kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, i'm not saying it is, remember, but... what if i gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{that's the first time i've seen the lawyer side of you, tom. it's not your best side.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{okay, just hear me out. what if carlo had been paid to help get sonny killed? what if his beating of connie that time was a deliberate plot to get sonny out into the open? then what? and what if the don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband? what if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made michael his successor, knowing that michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{he's not the same as when i met him.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{if he were, he'd be dead by now. you'd be a widow. you'd have no problem.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{what the hell does that mean? come on, tom, speak out straight once in your life. i know michael can't, but you're not sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.}
<A>__{there is a long silence. then hagen shakes his head; he can tell her no more.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{if you told michael what i've told you today, i'm a dead man.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{when is it finally over? i want it to be over before my baby is born.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{i don't know. i hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.}
<A>__{he looks at her; it's clear that he has been entrusted with her safety and her children's. he is a kind, good man, and seems very nervous and overwrought.}
<B>__{view on the window}
<A>__{little anthony is pressing his face against the glass pane, as though he senses the adults are discussing something of importance to him.}
