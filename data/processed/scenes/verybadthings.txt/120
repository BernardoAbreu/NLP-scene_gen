<T>__{cut to black:}
<A>__{we hear the sounds of scrubbing.}
<T>__{slow fade up:}
<L>__{interior fisher house bathroom day}
<A>__{tight on liz, on her hands and knees, scrubbing around the toilet of what is clearly a filthy kids bathroom; soiled jockey shorts, tonka trucks, mess everywhere. o.s. we hear voices outside. liz gets up off her knees, brushes a piece of hair from her sweaty face and peers out the bathroom window.}
<B>__{tight on fisher}
<L>__{exterior back yard}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{okay let's try it again.}
<A>__{adam jr. and timmy, in ill fitted cub scout uniforms, recite the "scout laws."}
<C>__{timmy}
<A>__{a scout is thrifty, saves for the future. a scout is clean, he keeps his body...}
<C>__{adam jr.}
<D>__{a scout is brave. a scout can face danger, even if he's afraid...}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{let's see the salutes!}
<A>__{timmy snaps out a fine salute. adam balances on one crutch to salute but looses balance and falls flat on his face. he starts screaming. reveal fisher, in a wheelchair, both legs amputated above the knee. he leans over, trying to help adam jr. up and his wheel chair tips over. fisher falls on top of adam jr. who screams even louder, flailing arms and legs like a turtle on its back. reveal moore, in an electric wheel chair he operated with a mouthpiece. as he is paralyzed from the neck down, he's no help at all. timmy suddenly snaps.}
<C>__{timmy}
<P>__{(to adam jr.)}
<D>__{shut up! shut the fuck up!}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{it's okay, it's okay.}
<B>__{the bathroom window}
<A>__{liz watches the pathetic chaos that is her life with the dull lifeless eyes of a concentration camp prisoner.}
<C>__{fisher }
<D>__{timmy shut up! help your brother! adam! let him help you!}
<A>__{tight on liz as her mouth slowly opens in an anguished silent}
<B>__{scream.}
<A>__{out the window down in the back yard adam jr. gets back on his feet, with the begrudging help of timmy. as fisher struggles to hoist himself up, back in his wheelchair...}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{remember a scout is helpful! a scout doesn't scream in the face of adversity.}
<A>__{suddenly, o.s. from the bathroom, liz wails. fisher looks up at the window... long beat...}
<C>__{fisher}
<P>__{(to the boys)}
<D>__{okay, let's skip to the scout's oath... adam jr. & timmy on my honor, i will do my best...}
<A>__{the boys recite the "scout's oath" as liz's deep, heaving, wailing sobs grow in intensity o.c.}
<D>__{adam jr. & timmy ...to do my duty to god and my country... to obey the scout law, to help other people at all times...}
<A>__{slowly pull off fisher, moore and the kids...}
<D>__{adam jr. & timmy to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.}
<A>__{crane up, past liz at the window, out of the yard, over the house, wider to reveal the surrounding track like homes, housing track like families, with track like nightmares as liz's plaintiff wails echo the communal despair of the human village.}
