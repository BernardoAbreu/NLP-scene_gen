<L>__{interior apartment foyer day}
<A>__{luciano, lansky, and masseria stand aside in the elevator, allowing the guards to move ahead into the foyer.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{ain't had a decent meal in weeks. this fuckin' war's gonna have me skin and bones like you boys.}
<L>__{interior stake out apartment same}
<A>__{the windows overlooking the courtyard stand open, the winter air gusting into the room. the two toughs stand to either side of the windows, hidden from view, shotguns at the ready. in the courtyard the guards cluster by the entrance to the foyer. as the limousines appear at the curb, one of them taps on the foyer door. lansky steps into the courtyard, and follows the guards to the street. charlie steps into the doorway, blinking against the harsh midday light. he looks carefully up and down the courtyard, then signals for masseria.}
<B>__{as charlie steps aside to let masseria pass}
<A>__{he spots the open windows on the third floor opposite, the only ones open on a cold day. as masseria steps through the door, charlie throws himself at the boss, sending them both tumbling backwards into the foyer. shotgun blasts tear the door apart, as masseria shimmies backwards across the floor of the foyer.}
<B>__{charlie}
<A>__{edges up to the wall, breaks out a tiny window onto the court, and shoots up at the third floor.}
<B>__{one of the guards}
<A>__{charges up the courtyard from the street, only to be knocked over by a shotgun blast. the other guards stop in their tracks. disgusted lansky grabs a shotgun from one of the guards. runs down the street to the corner and around toward the alley.}
<B>__{the two toughs}
<A>__{throw their weapons to the floor, sprint to the kitchen, and on down the rear service staircase, followed closely by the dog.}
<B>__{they dash along a narrow passageway}
<A>__{that runs alongside the building, darting between garbage cans, man's best friend still in hot pursuit.}
<B>__{at the end of the passageway}
<A>__{the older tough scales a tall chain link fence. as he throws his leg over the top, lansky jumps out from behind a wall and blows the man's face clean off his skull. his body topples backwards, landing at the feet of the young tough.}
<B>__{as the young tough backs up}
<A>__{lansky shoves the barrel of the shotgun through the fence, and blasts him in the chest. the dog yaps threateningly at meyer. in the foyer masseria moves cautiously toward the door, where charlie stands, as the guards outside shout confused instructions to one another.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{these fools would have me dead. anything, charlie. tell me what you want.}
<A>__{charlie grabs masseria playfully by the back of his fat neck, then kisses him sicilian style, full on the lips.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{trust me.}
