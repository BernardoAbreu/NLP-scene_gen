<L>__{exterior 76 station night}
<A>__{embers of a campfire glow. the postman is asleep, the carbine in reach. bill brays and nervously stamps his hooves. the postman reaches for the carbine only to find the barrel of a shotgun pointed in his face. three bandits! hard eyed and ugly. one, barely 20, is mostly just ugly. the postman looks down the barrels of a shotgun, a rifle and a revolver. the lead bandit kicks the carbine out of reach.}

<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i'm not a holnist.}
<A>__{the lead bandit pokes again. harder. the postman opens his shirt, reveals his bare left shoulder.}
<C>__{the postman}

<C>__{the postman}

<C>__{the postman}

<C>__{hulking bandit}
<D>__{he is mouthin' you; i say we kill him.}
<C>__{lead bandit}

<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{okay! my stuff's up there!}
<A>__{the 76 ball is twenty feet above the ground. in the gloom you can just see a hole has been punched through the side.}

<C>__{lead bandit}
<D>__{you go up and get it.}
