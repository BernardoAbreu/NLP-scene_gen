<L>__{interior bank}
<A>__{gabriel jerks out his weapon and jams it against stan's head as he and marco roll around on the ground.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{won't do you any good. the money jumps every 60 seconds from one numbered account to another and will for the next ten years. 'course it wasn't supposed to happen for another six hours. the power surge must have scrambled the internal clock. but, you kill me and you never get a single dollar.}
<A>__{gabriel eases up, wheels spinning at millions of rpms.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{you let the hostages go and then i will tell you where and when you can extract the money. we all walk away, nobody gets hurt. the accounts are encrypted with a 1024 bit cipher. even i can't break through the fire wall. it's my act of god policy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{deal?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i'm thinking.}
<A>__{a very tense moment passes. gabriel looks around. he has an idea.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{tell ya what. no deal.}
<A>__{marco pulls a length of towing cable from one of the hummer's winches and throws the line over one of the 30 foot high ceiling buttresses. gabriel grabs the cable as it comes down as two mercs rush in and grab stanley, one placing a knife to his throat.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{marco! grab agent sculley!}
<A>__{marco grabs ginger and drags her kicking, fighting, over to where gabriel stands, brandishing the cable.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{no, don't do this.}
<A>__{stanley struggles like there is no tomorrow. gabriel hooks the end into a noose with the tow hook, and puts it over ginger's head, pulling it taut around her neck. he cuts the cable tie loose. she digs at them with her fingers. two mercs rush in and grab stanley, one placing a knife to his throat. stanley struggles like there is no tomorrow.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{in all reality, stan, she has you to thank for this. that first night in prague you broke the d.o.d. database that contained her true identity. she's d.e.a., stan, but without you, i never would have known.}
<C>__{stanley}
<P>__{(freaking)}
<D>__{what are you doing? stop!}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{string up the d.e.a. bitch.}
<A>__{marco hits the power switch. ginger is yanked up into the air, hanging twenty feet above the floor.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{just let her down. i will do whatever you want.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{then get me my money, stan.}
<A>__{stanley looks up at ginger, valiantly struggling for her life.}

<D>__{i'm not doing shit until you bring her down. i'm serious. let her down. now!}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{gabriel yanks out his .40 cal. h&k, turns and shoots the hanging ginger.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{nooo...}
<A>__{stanley looks at her lifeless body as they lower her. he looks up at gabriel and runs at him. gabriel slaps him in the throat, spinning him, and grabs stan around the neck in the crook of his arm.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(close and very serious)}
<D>__{take a moment, big guy. don't make me put you in a wheelchair.}
<A>__{in the b.g. two mercs zip ginger's body into a black body bag and carry her out.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{you didn't have to kill her.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i didn't stan, you did. but we're not done yet.}
<P>__{(to marco)}
<D>__{marco...}
<A>__{marco yanks a seventeen year old girl up from the floor and puts a gun to her head.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{there are a lot of hostages here. i cared about ginger, can you imagine what i could do to someone i don't care about. how long before the money jumps?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{sixty seconds.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{they better hope you installed a back door or it could be a long day. somebody get me a laptop.}
<A>__{a laptop appears. gabriel hands it to stanley and nods to the mercs who drop him. stanley drops to his knees, placing the computer on the ground. stanley has logged onto the net via modem and we hear that familiar pulse as he does. he connects onto an encrypted site on the net. his fingers hum over the keys.}

<D>__{forty five seconds, stanley.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i need another laptop, logged on!}
<A>__{he tries to keep from looking up at the crying hostage. the columns decrease. another laptop appears.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{twenty seconds, stan.}
<A>__{his fingers still fly. three columns now. he works on the other laptop with his right hand.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{fifteen. she's gonna die, stanley.}
<C>__{stanley}
