<A>__{ted nervously moves down the hallway toward the front door. he has it in sight on the far end of the living room, but when he gets closer to the living room doorway, he sees that donny is sitting in an armchair, watching the incredible hulk (the old tv show). ted darts back into the hallway before he's seen, but in the process, bumps into a small table with a lamp and a couple knick knacks on it. one of them, a small ceramic penguin, falls over, making a sound. donny turns and looks in the direction of the hallway.}
