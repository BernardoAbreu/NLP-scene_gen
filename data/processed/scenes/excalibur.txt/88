<T>__{fade out: a legend appears:}
<A>__{"and arthur built his castle, camelot. and one day, in the far reaches of the kingdom..."}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior forest, stream day}
<A>__{it is shadowy and dark; ancient trees creak, unseen animals cry out. a rabbit hops into view and a boy leaps forward, grabbing the animal by the ears before it can move. he perceval is a wild boy of seventeen, dressed in skins with an endearing and childlike smile.}
<C>__{perceval}
<P>__{(to the rabbit)}
<D>__{sorry. hungry.}
<A>__{a din is heard to the forest, and it grows. perceval glances around, panicked. the sound is the rubbing of leather upon leather, of metal on metal, for now a mounted figure in armor hovers over the terrified boy.}
<C>__{perceval}
<P>__{(stuttering)}
<D>__{have i taken too much?}
<A>__{he lets the rabbit go free. the threatening figure dismounts. and perceval, cartwheels backward, landing in the stream and scooping a fish out.}
<C>__{perceval}
<P>__{(desperately trying to ingratiate)}
<D>__{i had rabbit yesterday. today i will eat fish... no?}
<A>__{he returns the fish to the water. the figure steps into a pool of sunlight and a glorious halo streaks from the armor. it is lancelot.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{don't be afraid.}
<A>__{perceval is overcome with astonishment, and he kneels.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{you're an angel! not a devil...}
<A>__{lancelot laughs and pulls the boy to his feet.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{just a man. a knight in the king's service.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{you're a man?!}
<P>__{(he reaches out to touch lancelot)}
<D>__{...with metal skin!}
<A>__{perceval is beside himself with enthusiasm.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{can i grow metal skin?}
<A>__{lancelot rolls his eyes, amused.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{you've got a lot to learn.}
