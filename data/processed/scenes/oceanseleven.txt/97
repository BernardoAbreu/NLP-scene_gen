<A>__{at the table, saul bets heavily for the bank. benedict approaches, stands off to the right, watching.}
<C>__{high roller}
<P>__{(to saul, noticing his heavy bet)}
<D>__{you don't want to get in the hole too heavy to this benedict. a friend of mine once borrowed a hundred g's from the guy. two months went by, benedict hadn't heard from him, he calls my friend up, asks 'where's my money?' i will get to it when i get to it,' my friend says. half hour later benedict's in my friend's hotel room, dangling him off his 10th floor balcony by his feet. 'you gonna get to it now?'}

<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{mr. weintraub. how's everything?}
<C>__{high roller}
<D>__{eh. they put too much grenadine in my shirley temple.}
<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{and here i thought you were drinking vodka.}
<P>__{(turning attention to saul)}
<D>__{mr. zerga.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{mr. benedict. i recognize you from the tv. you know, nine casinos out of ten, owner comes up in the middle of the hand to ask me what i want. i respect your waiting.}
<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{you're the guest, sir.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{and i have to impose on your hospitality. can you sit in for a hand?}
<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{i'd love to, mr. zerga, but the gaming board would feed me to my white tigers.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{that's a shame. you're the king of vegas and you have to play craps in the alley.}
<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{no shame at all. reminds me of my youth.}
<A>__{corner moment later benedict and saul are huddled in a corner.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{the fight is saturday, is it not?}
<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{yes. i can get you seats...}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{no, no. hand to hand combat doesn't interest me. i have a package arriving here saturday evening. a black briefcase, standard size, the contents of which are very valuable to me.}
<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{i'd be happy to put it in the house safe for you.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{the house safe is for brandy and grandmother's pearls. i'm afraid i need something more secure.}
<C>__{benedict}
<D>__{i can assure you, the house safe is utterly...}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(his looks stops benedict)}
<D>__{i can assure you, mr. benedict, your generosity in this matter will not go overlooked. now: what can you offer me besides the safe?}
<A>__{saul's eyes are pure steel: he is not a man familiar with being denied. and benedict recognizes that fact.}
