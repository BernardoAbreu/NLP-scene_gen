<ACTION>__{While this remains, we hear: "I believe in America." Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great emotion.}

<DIAL>__{I raised my daughter in the American fashion; I gave her freedom, but taught her never to dishonor her family.  She found a boy friend, not an Italian.  She went to the movies with him, stayed out late. Two months ago he took her for a drive, with another boy friend. They made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her.  She resisted; she kept her honor.  So they beat her like an animal.  When I went to the hospital her nose was broken, her jaw was shattered and held together by wire, and she could not even weep because of the pain.}

<DIAL>__{I went to the Police like a good American.  These two boys were arrested and brought to trial.  The judge sentenced them to three years in prison, and suspended the sentence.  Suspended sentence! They went free that very day.  I stood in the courtroom like a fool, and those bastards, they smiled at me.  Then I said to my wife, for Justice, we must go to The Godfather.}
<ACTION>__{By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office in his home. The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with patterned shadows.  We are watching BONASERA over the shoulder of DON CORLEONE.  TOM HAGEN sits near a small table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a glass of wine.  We can HEAR music, and the laughter and voices of many people outside.}

And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.}

There is music and laughing and dancing and countless tables covered with food and wine. DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of the wedding party.  He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the children, and makes them all welcome.  They in turn carry with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies. The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE, MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.

We HEAR the music and laughter coming from the party in the distance. A MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number. BARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to embrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard. The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.

The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card, without saying a word.  SONNY steps back, spits on the ground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE, and another TWO MEN.  He doesn't say a thing for most of the walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.}

He feels his own body frantically, moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face with the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of his bed.  Just blood from the hacked neck.  White reedy tendons show.  He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle of blood to see more clearly.  Froth covers the muzzle, and the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered with blood.

His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand. SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned. SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength, in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing.  His blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood. The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching in fascination. CARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing. SONNY beats him mercilessly. Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become spectators. SONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into CARLO's face and body. CARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does nothing, other than hang onto the railing. SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in the effort.  Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands; even biting them.  CARLO screams but he does not let go. It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will not be moved.  SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him more; but he is exhausted.

The VIEW ALTERS, and we see that the line is endless.  JOHNNY FONTANE, tears openly falling, takes his turn. Children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last look at the great man. CLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE.  LAMPONE immediately arranges for the members of the Five New York Families to pay their respects. First CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI.  Then PHILIP TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin. Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time. MICHAEL watches the scene. BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined by his men. As BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that he is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don Corleone. MICHAEL watches silently. BARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes.  First CLEMENZA.  Then TESSIO. CONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes.  He embraces and comforts her.

<ACTION>__{CARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his things in the trunk. ONE opens the front door for him. SOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who. CARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back to see the other man. It is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially. The motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA suddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck.  He chokes and leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet. The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color. His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield. Then the body goes slack. CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car drives off.}
