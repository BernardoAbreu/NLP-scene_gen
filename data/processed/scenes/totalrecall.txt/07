<A>__{quail and kirsten sit at a small table, eating breakfast. on the wall is projected the front page of a newspaper. drinking his coffee, quail studies the wall with the air of a man who had his "node stuck in a newspaper," ignoring his wife. the newspaper headline reads: "rioting on mars over water tax." his wife is reading a different article: "four women rape man in park."}

<D>__{well, there's a lot of things we need around here before we waste our money on a trip to mars. we're broke. i'm just a slave around this dump. now if you were capable of finding a better job....}
