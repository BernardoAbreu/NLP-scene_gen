<L>__{exterior army navy parking lot day}
<A>__{curtis stands at the driver's door of his pick up. the box sits on the seat in front of him. he opens it and removes one of the gas masks. he stares into its vacant plastic eyes. he drops the mask back into the box and shakes his head. sighs, frustrated with it all. he checks over his shoulder, scans the parking lot.}
<L>__{exterior laforche backyard later}
<A>__{curtis stands on top of the shipping container that rests in the hole roughly a foot below the yard. wearing tinted goggles, he cuts a circular hole in the top of the container with a small blowtorch. the sparks stop and curtis raises the goggles to inspect his work. he kicks at the weld with the heel of his boot and the metal falls into the container. he sets down the torch and removes a roof turbine vent from a cardboard box and holds it up next to the newly cut hole.}
<C>__{kyle }
<D>__{what the hell are you doin'?}
<A>__{curtis smiles to himself. he turns to find kyle(42) standing at the edge of the hole. his hands are tucked into the back of his jeans and he's sizing up the work. curtis steps off the roof of the shipping container onto ground level. he holds out a hand and kyle shakes it, never taking his eyes off the unfinished shelter.}
<C>__{kyle }
<D>__{what you got goin' on here?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{just addin' on to the storm shelter.}

<A>__{kyle is staring him down. curtis just looks at the shelter. there's a long silence shared between them.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{samantha called me.}

<A>__{curtis climbs back onto the shipping container and continues installing the roof vent.}
<C>__{curtis }
