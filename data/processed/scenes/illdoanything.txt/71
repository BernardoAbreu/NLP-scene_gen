<L>__{interior burke's bedroom early evening}
<A>__{a post coital moment though only the man is visible; burke, who lies on the bed wearing a shirt and tie and nothing else. nan lies out of sight on the floor where she is recovering from the deepest orgasm of her life.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{why not? if you can test movies and premises and want to sees, why can't you test screen tests?}
<A>__{nan hauls herself into view, climbing back onto the bed.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{i can't deal with your self centered dribble right now. i have just had the biggest orgasm of my life and i'm trying to figure out if i'm in love with you.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{whoops. tell me what made you rush over and pick me up and bring me here at six o'clock. i mean we seem to have...}
<A>__{she closes her eyes in a characteristic and touching gesture, as the scientist in her struggles to be precise.}
<C>__{nan}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{...this unspoken agreement not to talk about why we're together when we're together and i don't think it's good to let that become a pattern for us.}
<A>__{she focuses again on burke. prepared for, at last, some verbal intimacy.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{why did i rush to you? because i felt like i had to... be with someone and you were closest.}
<P>__{(on nan's reaction)}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{you're not at all aware that you've just said something...}
<P>__{(her eyes close)}
<D>__{...unattractive?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{look, i'm sorry if that came out...}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{i'm not looking for an apology.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i'm just trying to say that one of the things i'm not great at is...}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{let's not make this about your shortcomings. i'm sure you've had enough of those conversations to last you a lifetime. what i'm...}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{no, i haven't.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{no, you haven't what?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{had a conversation about shortcomings...}
<C>__{nan}
<P>__{(aghast)}
<D>__{no woman has ever told you that you have an almost barbaric insensitivity? that you seem to have lapsed into some final cynicism, where you actually believe that, not only does everyone think the way you do, but only you have the courage to express it? that you seem horribly certain everyone else is sort of pretending when they talk about love or seem to care for anything outside their own anus? no one's ever said that sort of thing to you?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{oh, yeah... but i didn't get what you meant by 'shortcomings.' hey, if you think things like that, what are you doing here?}
<C>__{nan}
<P>__{(indignantly)}
<D>__{i'm here for the same reason 86 percent of older women loved 'beauty and the beast.' i would like to believe that underneath the creature, there is a sweet, caring guy.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i sure hope you're wrong.}
<A>__{nan breaks up, shaking her head ruefully.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{i have to pick up leslie.}
<A>__{burke, not having intended humor, is also lighthearted, having somehow avoided a tight spot.}
