<L>__{exterior british fort courtyard day}
<A>__{evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of books. a blast of thunder and lightning scares her. she drops half the books. then a hand grabs her! she jumps again and drops the rest of the books. it's o'connell, breathing hard.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{we got problems.}
<A>__{and that's when a barrage of hail and fire slams into the courtyard. o'connell and evelyn jump back. a water fountain bursts into steam. a wooden trellis catches fire. o'connell and evelyn run under the eaves as soldiers, servants and camels run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom.}

<D>__{he's here! i saw him! that thing is here!}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{the creature!? are you sure!?}
<A>__{o'connell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the hail and fire.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{pretty sure!}
<A>__{the hail and fire come to a stop. everything goes dead quiet. o'connell and evelyn freeze. and then a blood curdling scream is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them. o'connell and evelyn race up the stairs.}
