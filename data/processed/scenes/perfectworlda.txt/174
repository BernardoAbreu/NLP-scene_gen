<L>__{interior dottie's cafe night}
<A>__{phillip, at the booth, plays with the parsley on his empty plate, which sits across from butch's barely touched one. the boy looks over his shoulder and sneaks a peek at butch, who sits at a barstool watching eileen work behind the counter.}
<B>__{at counter}
<A>__{butch leans over and whispers something sexy into eileen's ear. she giggles and licks her lips. butch feels eyes on his back and looks at phillip, who immediately turns away from them. when butch returns his attention to eileen she's moved a few feet away and is refilling ketchup bottles.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{buzz, go ahead and chew on mine if you want.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{no thankyew.}
<A>__{eileen slides back down toward butch. she makes refilling condiment bottles the sexiest pasttime since the hula hoop.}
<C>__{eileen}
<D>__{very polite.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{i try hard but, ya' know, since his mama died...}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{ my mama's not dead!}
<A>__{butch, a tad annoyed, turns to phillip and gives him a look. once again, when he turns back, eileen has moved. she's flirting with butch, moving, bending, wiping her hands on her hips. his eyes are focused on her every squirm.}
<C>__{butch}
<P>__{(over his shoulder)}
<D>__{okay now, buzz, you go on out in the parking lot and chunk some rocks or something.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{phillip reluctantly slides down off the stool and slowly walks out the door. his eyes stay on butch and eileen, barely concealing confusion mixed with a hint of jealousy.}
<C>__{eileen}
<D>__{so is she dead or not?}
<C>__{butch}
<P>__{(covering badly)}
<D>__{well his biological mother is alive. gave him up for adoption to me and my wife. my dead wife, that is. she is, was phil, er buzz's stepmother, so she's his mom, was his mom, stepmom, but... she's dead.}
<C>__{eileen}
<D>__{i'm so sorry.}
<A>__{but she's not. in fact it seems to have turned her on even more. she puts her hand behind butch's neck and slowly pulls him close for gentle kiss.}
