<A>__{quinn walks into his room. to his surprise, zoey is sitting on his bed. it appears she has been there for a while.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{how do people keep ending up in my room?}
<C>__{zoey}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{you need to learn to lock up.}
<A>__{quinn walks over and sits on the bed beside her.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{i'm not fighting louis.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{why the change of heart?}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{i think you might be right. i don't think it's necessary. i think the world will keep turning one way or another. i'm not dependant on that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm not a savior.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{do you really believe? you know?}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{yes. i do believe it. i know it actually. since i have been with you, i've doubted what i know to be fact though. then it hit me, it really doesn't matter.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{i will help you quinn. i don't want to do it for myself...}
<C>__{zoey }
<D>__{i don't want to do it because i feel i have to. obligations, or dark incidents from my past...that's not a reason to help anyone. it makes me fucking selfish actually.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{you're not selfish zoey.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{i care about you quinn. that's sincerely my reason for wanting to do this. that's a first for me you know?}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{i know...}
<A>__{quinn hugs her and they slowly lay down on the bed together.}
