<A>__{cheryl enters the room wrapped in a white, terry cloth robe. the room is dominated by a small, beautifully tiled immersion pool with a hand rail and steps. the mikvah lady gets up from her chair and approaches her.}
<C>__{mikvah lady}
<D>__{is this your first time?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{yes, it is. i'm converting.}
<A>__{she takes off her robe and hands it to the mikvah lady, who does not fail to notice cheryl's body.}
<C>__{mikvah lady}
<D>__{so, what do you do?}
<A>__{cheryl closes her eyes and thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{i don't think you'd understand.}
<C>__{mikvah lady}
<D>__{you can try me.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{okay. i'm a housewife.}
<C>__{mikvah lady}
<D>__{why shouldn't i understand?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{i guess i was mistaken.}
<A>__{cheryl steps towards the pool.}
<C>__{mikvah lady}
<D>__{i see you're very comfortable with being naked.}
<A>__{she takes hold of the rail and puts her foot in the water.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{that has never been one of my problems.}
<C>__{mikvah lady}
<D>__{sometimes new brides come with their mothers. do i have to take this off? can i please leave this on? they've never been naked before. no honey, it all has to come off.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{and it does?}
<A>__{cheryl takes another step into the water.}
<C>__{mikvah lady}
<D>__{and it does. they stand on the edge of that pool without anything to cling to but themselves. nothing to hide behind. this is your body. this is the body that god crafted for you.}
<A>__{cheryl immerses herself up to her chest.}
<C>__{mikvah lady }
<D>__{immerse completely. go completely under the water, without touching the walls or anything.}
<A>__{she immerses completely. we see her under the water. she hears a voice in the distance, her own voice. at the same time, there is a look of elation in her eyes.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{okay mark, you can open your eyes now.}
