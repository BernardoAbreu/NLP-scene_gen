<L>__{interior bus stop day}
<A>__{walter rides the bus, staring out the window. sensing something, he looks up. a girl sits across from walter. she is about twelve years old. she wears glasses and a pair of binoculars hangs around her neck. she casually nibbles on food she produces from her backpack. she glances at walter briefly then looks back out the window. walter turns away.}
<L>__{interior walter's kitchen night}

<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i'm not scared.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{neither am i.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{maybe you should be.}
<A>__{walter gets up from the table and clears his plate to the sink. vicki looks at him.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{well, walter, i got an idea of my own.}
<A>__{he avoids her look.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{you listening to me?}
<A>__{he doesn't answer.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{we should live together.}

<P>__{(looks at her)}
<D>__{live together.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{move in with me.}
<A>__{he stares at her.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{it's a bad idea.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i think it's a fucking good idea.}
<A>__{walter goes to the fridge for a beer.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i don't even know how to live with myself.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{just think about it.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i've got problems.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{who doesn't?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{most people don't have my kind of problems.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{guess that makes you pretty special.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{that's not what i meant.}
<A>__{vicki looks at him blankly.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{i say we call it quits.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{vicki puts her fork down, pulls on her jacket and exits. walter looks at the closed door, baffled.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{she's gone.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{that was easy.}
<A>__{he takes a swig from his beer.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{good. i'm glad. i'm fucking glad!}
<A>__{vicki jogs down the stairs and over to her jeep. she opens the door. walter pulls the carving he was working on from a drawer and looks at it. it's finished. vicki reenters holding a plant and sets it loudly on the table. walter looks at her then at the plant.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{hat's this?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{what's it look like?}
<A>__{she gets herself a beer from the fridge.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i don't need a plant.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{everyone needs a plant. this ivy is one tough baby. it's a cutting from one of mine.}
<A>__{walter seems at a loss. vicki takes a swig from her beer.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{here's the deal. give it a little water. go easy on the direct sunlight. and notice it every once in a while. they love it when you look at them, or touch their leaves. can you handle that?}
<A>__{walter looks unconvinced.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{you're such an asshole.}
<A>__{she kisses him then gives him a teasing look.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{don't be scared, walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(cracking a smile)}
<D>__{i'm not scared.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{prove it.}
<A>__{vicki walks towards the bedroom.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{vicki turns. he tosses her the carving. vicki catches it and looks at it for a long moment, then at walter.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{i made it for you.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{it's cedar.}
