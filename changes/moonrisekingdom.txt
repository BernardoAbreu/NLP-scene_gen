<LOC>__{INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY}
<ACTION>__{A landing at the top of a crooked, wooden staircase. There is a threadbare, braided rug on the floor. There is a long, wide corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and battleships. The wallpapers are sun-bleached and peeling at the corners except for a few newly-hung strips which are clean and bright. A small easel sits stored in the corner. Outside, a hard rain falls, drumming the roof and rattling the gutters. A ten-year-old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully eating a bowl of cereal as he walks. He is Lionel. Lionel slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window. He takes out a portable record player, puts a disc on the turntable, and sets the needle into the spinning groove. A child's voice says over the speaker:}
<CHAR>__{RECORD PLAYER } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{In order to show you how a big symphony orchestra is put together, Benjamin Britten has written a big piece of music, which is made up of smaller pieces that show you all the separate parts of the orchestra.}
<ACTION>__{As Lionel listens, three other children wander out of their bedrooms and down to the landing. The first is an eight-year-old boy in a bathrobe. He is Murray. The second is a nine-year-old boy in white boxer shorts and a white undershirt. He is Rudy. The third is a twelve-year-old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee-high socks and brightly polished, patent-leather shoes. She is Suzy. She carries a one-month-old striped kitten. The boys drop down to the floor next to their brother. They lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their fists, listening. Suzy sits in the windowsill. She opens a book called Shelly and the Secret Universe. There is an illustration on the cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her neck. Suzy starts to read -- then pauses. She lowers her book. She raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes. She looks out into the rain.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY}
<ACTION>__{A rickety, three-story, stone-and-shingle house on a hillside with turrets and a widow's walk. A weather vane swings creaking on the roof. Tree tops sway in a cluster below. The sea is almost invisible in the misting rain, and the mainland is a shadow across the sound. Suzy sits in the high window, watching.}
<TRANS>__{TITLES OVER:}
<ACTION>__{The family stuck indoors all day out of the rain. In bedrooms, bathrooms, and corridors, we see the boys. They shoot marbles. They throw jacks. They play cards. They eat grilled cheese sandwiches together in the kitchen. In half-open doorways, we see the parents. Mr. Bishop is a tall, fifty-year-old man in Madras trousers and horn-rimmed glasses. He reads the newspaper and drinks coffee. Mrs. Bishop is a tan, forty-five-year-old woman in a Lilly Pulitzer-type wrap-around skirt. She washes her hair, topless, in the kitchen sink. In windows, we see Suzy with her binoculars. She watches wet branches shaking in the woods. She watches a man in a slicker fishing from a row-boat. She watches a white colt in a field. She eats a bowl of tomato soup alone in the pantry. In the distance, a seaplane flies by below the clouds.}
<TRANS>__{CUT TO:}
<ACTION>__{The edge of a cliff above a white beach. A rocky peninsula curls into the background. Brisk wind rustles the tall grass. A fifty-year-old man, bald on top with long hair on the sides, stands next to a surveyor's levelling instrument on a tripod. He wears rubber boots and a parka. He is the narrator. He speaks to the camera:}
<CHAR>__{NARRATOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This is the island of New Penzance. Sixteen miles long. Forested with old- growth pine and maple. Criss-crossed by shallow tidal creeks. An important seabird habitat. There are no paved roads but instead many miles of intersecting foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry that runs twice daily from Stone Cove. The year is 1965. We are on the far edge of Black Beacon Sound, famous for the ferocious and well-documented storm which will strike from the east on the fifth of September -- in three day's time.}
<LOC>__{EXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY}
<ACTION>__{A clearing in the woods with ten small, khaki tents pitched in a row. A banner on a flag-pole ripples in the wind. It reads Camp Ivanhoe. A bugler in a khaki uniform with a yellow neckerchief plays a staccato tattoo. He has a gauze patch over one eye. He is Lazy-Eye. A thirty-five-year-old man in the same uniform emerges through the flaps of a larger tent. He is Scout Master Ward. He puts on a wide-brimmed felt hat. A badge on the crown reads Khaki Scouts, Troop 55. He lights a cigarette. A thin scout with curly hair and sunglasses joins him at his side. He is Gadge.}

<ACTION>__{Gadge flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book. Scout Master Ward goes over to a latrine made from thick sticks and rope. A tall, stooped scout digs a trench next to it with an army-shovel. He is Deluca.}

<DIAL>__{Deluca. Latrine inspection.}
<ACTION>__{Deluca stops digging. He pulls on a rope and water runs down a chute. It bursts through a valve, spins a little door, and a small, red flag flips up. Scout Master Ward nods.}

<ACTION>__{A small, woven, multi-colored cord with a rabbit's foot attached to the end of it. It has been braided exceedingly badly and is brutally twisted and misshapen. Scout Master Ward studies the lanyard briefly. He looks perplexed. He pats Roosevelt on the back gently and does a secret handshake with him. Gadge makes a note. Scout Master Ward strides away. An off-road motorcycle races by in the background behind the tents. It jumps a mound of dirt, kicks sideways in the air, and revs away riding a wheelie. Scout Master Ward frowns. Scout Master Ward stops in front of a pile of boards and logs stacked six feet high. A thick-set scout with black hair and a crooked tooth approaches with more logs in his arms. He is Skotak.}

He stops in front of a work-bench covered with newspaper where one scout sifts green powder through a funnel into cardboard tubes and another makes wax stoppers with a metal press. They are Panagle and Izod. A sign on the side of the table reads No Smoking. Scout Master Ward hands his cigarette to Gadge, who holds it away at arm's length.}

<ACTION>__{The motorcycle skids to a stop in front of Scout Master Ward, engulfing him in a thick cloud of dust. He coughs and waves his arms in the air. As the smoke clears, we see that the rider is a bronze, all-American-looking boy with blond hair. He is Redford. His motorcycle has flames painted on the gas tank. He tries to cover for himself:}

<DIAL>__{Morning, Chef.}
<ACTION>__{Chef rings a bell hanging on a post. Scout Master Ward arrives at a long picnic table. He sits down and opens a magazine called Indian Corn. There is a picture on the cover of a scout troop crossing a bridge in Indonesia.}
<TRANS>__{INSERT:}
<ACTION>__{The first page. A caption across the top reads Scout Master- in-Chief. There is a drawing of a seventy-year-old man on horseback. He has silver hair and a moustache. A signature below reads Commander Pierce. There is a quotation in large text: "An eagle was never hatched from a goose's egg." As Scout Master Ward reads, all the scouts begin to join him one-by-one. They range in age from twelve to fifteen. They unscrew the tops of tin mess-kits and assemble folding utensils. The chef brings a tray of scrambled eggs to the table. The scouts serve themselves noisily. Scout Master Ward starts to take a sip of coffee from a metal cup -- then stops. He looks up from his magazine.}

<ACTION>__{Lazy-Eye plays another tattoo. Silence. Scout Master Ward closes his magazine. He flicks his cigarette into a red bucket labelled Fire. He picks up a strip of bacon and chews on it as he rises to his feet and walks down the row of smaller tents. The last one is sealed at the front. Scout Master Ward stands with his hands on his hips and says:}

<DIAL>__{Sam?}
<ACTION>__{Scout Master Ward looks concerned. He produces a wooden- handled scout pocket-knife. He unfolds a few blades and gadgets and decides quickly on a thin tool with a hook on the end. He crouches down and slips the hook through a small gap at the base of the flap, twists left and right, then pulls up briskly, unzipping the tent.}
<LOC>__{INT. SCOUT TENT. DAY}
<ACTION>__{The lining of the tent is printed with images of trees and pine cones, and a plaid rug covers the floor. There is a foot locker, a gas lamp, a chair with a folded blanket over it, and an empty cot. Scout Master Ward steps inside slowly, bent over, examining the space. He lifts the lid of the foot locker. He looks under the corner of the mattress. He picks up a piece of folded yellow notebook paper sticking out from under a pillow. He opens it and stares at it. He turns suddenly to the chair against the wall of the tent and slides it aside. There is neat but slightly jagged hole the size of a basketball cut through the fabric in the back corner. Scout Master Ward looks to his staring troop.}

There is a wood-panelled station wagon parked alongside it with roller-lights on the roof and a sheriff's office insignia on the door. (This is the only car on the island.) A dock stretches from the cottage into a small harbor. There is a launch moored at the end of it which bobs in the rough tide. A silver Airstream trailer is parked under a tree nearby. A six-foot tall, forty-five-year-old man sits on a stool fishing from the side of the dock. He wears a short-sleeved police uniform with a black necktie and a baseball cap. His glasses have clear, plastic frames and a strap. He is Captain Sharp. Two grouchy, leathery, very old men in plaid flannel and hunting caps fish alongside Captain Sharp. A speaker on a post emits an electric buzz. Captain Sharp turns. He stands up briskly and says to one of the old men:}

Suzy sits in a small armchair reading a book called The Return of Auntie Lorraine.
