<D>__{it is the mid 22nd century. mankind has explored the boundaries of his own solar system, and now he reaches out to the endless interstellar distances of the universe. he moves away from his own small planetary system in huge hyperdrive starships: computer driven, self supporting, closed system spacecraft that travel at mind staggering post light velocities. man has begun to spread among the stars. enormous ships embark with generations of colonists searching the depths of space for new earths, now homes, new beginnings. far in advance of these colony ships goes a new pioneer: the scouts, the pathfinders, a special breed of man who has dedicated his life to blazing the trail through the most distant, unexplored galaxies, opening up the farthest frontiers of space. these are the men of the advance exploration corps. the task they face is one of unbelievable isolation and loneliness. so far from home that earth is no longer even a point of light in the sky, they must comb the universe for those unstable planets whose existence poses a threat to the peaceful colonists that follow. they must find these rogue planets and destroy them. among these commandos are the men of the scoutship dark star.}
