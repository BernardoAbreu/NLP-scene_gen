<A>__{on viwscreen we see a vast array of images, spiralling images, changing in size, shape, colour. its walls spinning and turning, looping and twisting, as the enterprise proceeds further into the cloud. amazed bridge crew members can do nothing but awe at the sight before thier eye's. even spock has turned to view the sight now illuminating the view screen. kirk sits pondering, amazed, thinking "what comes next?"}
