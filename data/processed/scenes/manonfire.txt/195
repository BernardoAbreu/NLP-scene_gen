<L>__{interior ground floor apartment day}
<A>__{a figure rises, framed in the window. and pinta stands beside him. as she puts her fingers in her ears... creasy looks back over his shoulder, but of course she's not there. creasy fires the rocket launcher. a gout of flame erupts from the back. but creasy has hung a blanket on the wall.}
<L>__{interior lead car day}
<A>__{eyes widening as the first rocket streaks toward them. the driver stands on the brakes. the car explodes, is obliterated really, from the inside out.}
