<A>__{this is a dry, desolate part of california. no downtown, no community. just tract after tract of arid farmland, with small, bland, unprotected ranch home cropping up out of the landscape like occasional tombstones. a beat up old sign on the road reads: "hinkley, ca. pop: " but the corner where the number would be has broken off. as a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields, erin turns onto community boulevard, the main road that cuts through hinkley.}
