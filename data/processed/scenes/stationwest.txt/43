<C>__{charlie}

<D>__{hello... i've been wondering where you were.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i lost my shirt.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you didn't imagine that i'd let you live in that hotel, did you? i want you available in case of trouble.}

<C>__{haven}
<D>__{this hotel is no good. the service is bad. the clerk's a poet, and the mattress is not quite as soft as a marble slab. but i'm beginning to like it... and if i open this window, and hear you singing...}
