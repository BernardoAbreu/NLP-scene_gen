<A>__{eric is dragging zoey by the hair toward the door when she grabs his groin and starts squeezing. eric lets out a shrill scream and whacks the butt of the uzi into her face. but she won't let go. her years as a prostitute have taught her to ignore pain. she grabs hold of the gun hand.}

<A>__{a few bursts of the uzi go off and one shell stitches eric's foot red. eric lets go and falls to the ground. claude, jean, and francois suddenly become attentive to what's going on. zoey starts firing the uzi but can't control it. she showers the room with bullets. she starts to run toward the back office blindly firing the gun in the direction of claude, eric, francois, jean, and the other hostages. then, a tear gas cannister break through the top windows and start clouding the place up. eric whips out his switch blade and hops on his bloody red foot.}
