<A>__{rachel sits on her bed drying her hair. she stops, listening to the indistinct murmur of the men's voices from the room next door. rachel leans towards the wall, trying to hear more but the voices fall silent.}
<L>__{interior safehouse morning}
<A>__{david, holding a kitchen knife, moves to stab stephan. stephan uses a krav magah move to disarm him. the knife clatters to the floor as he twists david's arm behind his back. there's an element of showing off and stephan uses a little more force than is necessary. david winces but doesn't say anything. stephan turns to rachel who has been watching.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{rachel nods and they change places. david picks up the knife and repeats the "attack" move on her. she disarms him easily.}
<C>__{stephan }
<D>__{now an attack from behind.}
<A>__{david takes his position, grabbing rachel from behind, but he's so awkward with her the attack seems a little tentative. stephan talks as rachel practises breaking free from the hold.}
