<L>__{exterior the ranch late afternoon}
<A>__{the ranch is colored in amber light. near the house, two long tables pushed together to make one long one... a gentle breeze ruffles the tablecloth. everyone is seated for a meal. we hear laughter and conversation... we parachute into the middle of the moments; hank helping with his wife get to their three children to sit still for dinner... diane organizing the women and their various plates of side dishes... the ranch hand piling up their plates and kidding each other... joe is instructing grace on the various sauces for the ribs. the twins are making fun of him behind his back. tom and smokey are barbecuing, the last one to sit. frank assists his frail mother, ellen booker, at the table, filling her plate with all the things she can't reach for.}
