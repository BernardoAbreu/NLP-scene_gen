<DIAL>__{...Rossen... Lieberman... Wachsberg...}
<ACTION>__{BEWILDERED RURAL FACES coming down off the passenger train. FORMS being set out on the folding tables. HANDS straightening pens and pencils and ink pads and stamps.}

<DIAL>__{...Biberman... Steinberg... Chilowitz...}
<ACTION>__{As a hand comes down stamping a GRAY STRIPE across a registration card, there is absolute silence... then MUSIC, the Hungarian love song, "Gloomy Sunday," distant... and the stripe bleeds into COLOR, into BRIGHT YELLOW INK.}
<LOC>__{INT. HOTEL ROOM - CRACOW, POLAND - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The song plays from a radio on a rust-stained sink. The light in the room is dismal, the furniture cheap. The curtains are faded, the wallpaper peeling... but the clothes laid out across the single bed are beautiful. The hands of a man button the shirt, belt the slacks. He slips into the double-breasted jacket, knots the silk tie, folds a handkerchief and tucks it into the jacket pocket, all with great deliberation. A bureau. Some currency, cigarettes, liquor, passport. And an elaborate gold-on-black enamel Hakenkreuz (or swastika) which the gentleman pins to the lapel of his elegant dinner jacket. He steps back to consider his reflection in the mirror. He likes what he sees: Oskar Schindler -- salesman from Zwittau -- looking almost reputable in his one nice suit. Even in this awful room.}
<LOC>__{INT. NIGHTCLUB - CRACOW, POLAND - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A spotlight slicing across a crowded smoke-choked club to a small stage where a cabaret performer sings. Its September, 1939. General Sigmund List's armored divisions, driving north from the Sudetenland, have taken Cracow, and now, in this club, drinking, socializing, conducting business, is a strange clientele: SS officers and Polish cops, gangsters and girls and entrepreneurs, thrown together by the circumstance of war. Oskar Schindler, drinking alone, slowly scans the room, the faces, stripping away all thats unimportant to him, settling only on details that are: the rank of this man, the higher rank of that one, money being slipped into a hand.}

<ACTION>__{The sergeant makes his way over to Schindler's table. There's a handshake and introductions before -- and the lieutenant, watching, can't believe it -- his guy accepts the chair Schindler's dragging over. The lieutenant waits, but his man doesn't come back; he's forgotten already he went there for a reason. Finally, and it irritates the SS man, he has to get up and go over there.}
<CHAR>__{LIEUTENANT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Stay here.}
<ACTION>__{His girlfriend watches him cross toward Schindler's table. Before he even arrives, Schindler is up and berating him for leaving his date way over there across the room, waving at the girl to come join them, motioning to waiter to slide some tables together.}

<ACTION>__{erupts from Schindler's party in the corner. Nobody's having a better time than those people over there. His guests have swelled to ten or twelve -- SS men, Polish cops, girls -- and he moves among them like the great entertainer he is, making sure everybody's got enough to eat and drink. Here, closer, at this table across the room, an SS officer gestures to one of the SS men who an hour ago couldn't get the girl to sit at his table. The guy comes over.}

<ACTION>__{A photograph of a face on a work card, BLACK and WHITE. A typed name, black and white. A hand affixes a sticker to the card and it saturates with COLOR, DEEP BLUE.

<CHAR>__{SCHINDLER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Like what?}
<ACTION>__{Stern smiles despite himself. The man's manner is so simple, so in contrast to his own and the complexities of being a Jew in occupied Cracow in 1939. He really doesn't know. Stern decides to end the conversation.}
<CHAR>__{STERN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well. In fact the worse things get the better you'll do. It was a "pleasure."}
<CHAR>__{SCHINDLER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The contracts? That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.}

He's being overcharged, and he knows it, but Pfefferberg keeps pushing it, more.
