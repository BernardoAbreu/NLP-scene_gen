<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior penrose steps later}
<A>__{arthur leads ariadne down some busy steps in a large glass and steel atrium in an office complex.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you're going to have to master a few tricks if you're going to build three complete dream levels.}
<A>__{a secretary drops some papers as they pass...}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{what sort of tricks?}
<A>__{they take a tight turn and continue down the next flight.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{in a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{that lets you create closed loops, like the penrose steps. the infinite staircase.}
<A>__{ariadne freezes they are in the exact spot they started descending from, next to the secretary gathering her papers. ariadne puzzles at the impossible construction of the stairs.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{see...}
<A>__{arthur stops her gently they are on the highest step, with a large drop to the next step. arthur gestures at the drop.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{paradox. a closed loop like this helps you disguise the boundaries of the dream you've created.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{how big do the levels have to be?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{anything from the floor of a building, to an entire city. but it has to be complicated enough for us to hide from the projections.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{a maze.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{and the better the maze }
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{the longer we have before the projections catch us.}
<A>__{ariadne looks around. sees people looking at arthur.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{my subconscious seems polite enough.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you wait, they'll turn ugly. no one likes to see someone else messing around in their mind.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{cobb can't build anymore, can he?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i don't know if he can't, but he won't. he thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{he won't tell me. i think it's mal. i think she's getting stronger.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{his ex wife?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{she's not his ex.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{they're still together?}
<A>__{arthur turns to ariadne. gentle.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{no. no, she's dead, ariadne. what you see in there is just his projection of her.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{what was she like in real life?}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{she was lovely.}
