<L>__{interior exterior slug mobile street night}
<A>__{an explosion of color and movement as opening titles play very quickly. we're traveling the streets in a n.d. sedan, getting moving glimpses of the aliens living among us now: a coffee shop where aliens eat at some window tables. a newcomer leaving a night school with an armload of books. a city park where a number of alien families have gathered to play some arcane alien game.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{jeez... they call that gang bang a game...?}
<A>__{ a billboard for pepsi featuring an alien. the sedan has pulled to a stop at a red light. suddenly a hand thumps against the glass next to sykes' head... and alien hand. sykes jumps. it's a newcomer derelict standing there, weaving, mumbling in his own language. in one filthy hand holds a quart carton of milk. we know immediately what he wants. sykes rolls down the window.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{take a hike.}
<A>__{sykes gets a whiff of the derelict's breath as the light changes and the sedan pulls away, leaving him in the street. sykes grimaces at the smell.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{why's it have to be sour milk that these guys get wasted on? what the hell's wrong with jack daniels, or thunderbird for chrissakes?}
<P>__{(beat; disgusted)}
<D>__{slagtown. shit...}
<A>__{ aliens hanging around outside their homes. alien hookers plying their trade.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{hope their plumbing's the same.}
<C>__{tuggle}
<D>__{it is.}
<P>__{(and sykes gives him a look)}
<A>__{ a newcomer lowrider pulls up beside the slug mobile. an alien couple exit a theater playing "terminator iii". an alien wig shop.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{titles end, and we start to pull back into the slug mobile and hear:}
<C>__{tuggle }
<D>__{so you gonna go, or you not gonna go?}
