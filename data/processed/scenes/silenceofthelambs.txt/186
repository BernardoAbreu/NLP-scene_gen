<D>__{all his victims are women... his obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. but not one women is hunting him except me. i can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.}

<A>__{he stares at her sadly. he looks, for the first time, defeated, old beyond his years.}

<D>__{ohio is cold ground. picked over, ten months ago. our people worked it, so did the locals.}

<P>__{(pulls out his wallet)}
<D>__{there's about $300 here... and a hotline code number. they'll patch you through to me, wherever i am.}
<A>__{she raises her hand to him. she wants to touch him face, or his neck, but can't. finally she takes his money and card.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he watches, frightened for both of them, as she backs away, smiles, then turns, racing towards the surveillance van.}
