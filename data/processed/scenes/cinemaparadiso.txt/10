<L>__{interior church evening}
<A>__{before the high altar, the virgin mary in tears clutches three spikes inher hand. and beside her is another statue christ descended from the cross. men and women stand in line to kiss christ's wounds. many people are sitting between the pews. salvatore helps alfredo take a seat, and at that moment catches sight at the far end of elena on her way to the confessional. she kneels down on one side, just as father adelfio comes out of the middle booth and goes to the altar to say something to the sacristan. salvatore's eyes light up. he has had a brainstorm. he leans over and whispers something into alfredo's ear. alfredo nods his head. salvatore is so happy that he gives him a pat on the cheek, like a caress. then he hurries over to the priest. says something in a low voice, gesticulates with some agitation, points to the pew where alfredo is sitting. the priest tries to say he can't now, but salvatore insists, and wins. the priest goes over to alfredo, leans over.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{what is it, alfredo? right now, of all times!}
<C>__{alfredo}
<P>__{(in a grave voice)}
<D>__{father adelfio, i have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. and you've got to help me, because i've lost all peace of mind...}
<A>__{salvatore watches from a distance. he sees the priest put on an alarmed expression and then sit down beside alfredo. everything's ready. he creeps over to the confessional. elena is there, kneeling down waiting for the priest to arrive. in an instant, without anyone noticing, salvatore pops inside the confessional. he shuts the little door below and draws the purple curtain. on the other side of grille, only a few inches away, those eyes that keep him awake all night.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{father, i have sinned...}
<C>__{salvatore}
<P>__{(in a low voice)}
<D>__{we'll talk about that later.}
<C>__{elena}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{but...who...}
<C>__{salvatore}
<P>__{(interrupting her)}
<D>__{sssssh, be quiet, pretend everything's normal. i'm salvatore.}
<A>__{elena's eyes pop in amazement.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<A>__{meanwhile alfredo and the priest continue their unusual and animated discussion. the priest is appalled, crosses himself.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{but alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!}
<C>__{alfredo}
<D>__{i know. but take the miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! i think about it a lot...how is it possible for...}
<A>__{in the confessional, the whispered conversation between salvatore and elena continues.}
<C>__{elena}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{there was a terrible rumpus at home. my mother told my father. and how could you have mistaken my voice?!}
<A>__{salvatore is mortified, on tenterhooks, keeps an eye on alfredo and the priest through a crack in the curtain.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{forgive me, elena. it was stupid of me. but i had to talk to you.}
<A>__{she looks up at him and her eyes are even more beautiful in the candlelight. this time salvatore finds the courage to speak to her calmly, with determination. that grille probably helps him, allows him to see without being seen.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{you're so beautiful, elena...that's what i wanted to tell you. when i meet you, i can't put two words together because...you give me the shivers. i don't know what you do in these situations, what you're supposed to say. it's the first time. but i think i'm in love with you.}
<A>__{elena gazes through the grille at the two shining specks of his eyes. she is bewildered by that flood of passion. at that moment, an old woman kneels down on the other side of the confessional and her face appears behind the grille.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{father, i have sinned...}
<P>__{(salvatore turns lo her, instinctively.)}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{i absolve you in the name of the father, the son and the holy ghost. go in peace, my daughter.}
<P>__{(and he slams the panel}
<D>__{shut in her face. elena is barely able to control her}
<P>__{laughter.)}
<D>__{when you laugh, you're even more beautiful.}
<A>__{she pulls herself together again and puts on a serious, but tender look.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{salvatore, it's awfully sweet of you. and even though i don't know you, i like you. but...i'm not in love with you.}
<A>__{for salvatore, it's as if a knife had plunged straight into his heart. he sits there gazing into her eyes, at the beauty mark on her lip, without moving. then through the crack sees alfredo and the priest conversing nervously, god knows what they're saying. and he turns back to her.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{i don't care. i will wait.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{for you to fall in love with me too. listen carefully. every night, when i get off work, i will come and wait beneath your window. every night. when you change your mind, open your window. that's all. i will understand...}
<A>__{he smiles at her. she is upset by those exaggerated words, but also intrigued. the priest has meanwhile solved the problem that alfredo has made up as an excuse.}
<C>__{priest}
<P>__{(exhausted)}
<D>__{you understand now? you see it clearly?}
<C>__{alfredo}
<P>__{(hypocritically)}
<D>__{oh yes, father. now everything's clear.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{and the next time don't go around saying such heresy. you survived the fire at the movie house. but no one can save you from the fire of hell!}
<C>__{exterior square and elena's house night}
<A>__{sweet poignant music accompanies salvatore's long waits beneath the window of elena's room... a warm early summer night. the last spectators wander off into the streets. the village idiot makes his rounds of the square. salvatore is beneath her window. he waits. the shutters are open, but not the windows with the curtains. elena peers at him through a dark crack...}
<D>__{fade to:}
<A>__{a rainy night. salvatore is back there again. determined, headstrong. a dog keeps him company, taking shelter under an overhanging roof. the window is shut...}
<D>__{fade to:}
<A>__{salvatore's hand adds another check to an endless row of checks on the calendar. a check a day...}
<D>__{fade to:}
<A>__{another night. wind. the window is still shut. salvatore's eyes are the eyes of a lovesick man prepared to face the hardest battles, just to win, just to conquer his loved one. she peeks at him through the crack, but he can't see her...}
<D>__{fade to:}
<A>__{the paces of the calendar are covered with checks. several months have gone by. salvatore adds a check on the last page, on 30 december. tomorrow night will be...new year's eve. the streets are empty. loud merry voices can be heard coming from the houses. old discarded objects hail down from balconies. firecrackers explode here and there. salvatore is there in the same old place, as usual. the shutters are open, but not the windows, and all is darkness inside. salvatore is wrapped in a large overcoat and stamps his feet to keep warm...}
<C>__{giancaldo. salvatores house interior night}
<A>__{toasts are being prepared in salvatore's house. maria is there with her daughter, lia, then alfredo with his wife, anna. salvatore is the only one missing for the "family" to be complete. the bottle of spumante and the christmas cake are ready. the radio is on with the new year's eve programme.}
<C>__{maria}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{but why hasn't toto shown up? the movie house is closed at this hour!}
<A>__{alfredo has a know all look. he tries to put her mind at rest.}
<C>__{alfredo}
<D>__{he had to do something for me...}
<A>__{over the radio, music and merrymaking}
