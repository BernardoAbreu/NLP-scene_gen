<L>__{exterior nyc street night}
<A>__{the last of the students are filing out. kaufman waits, leaning against the building. mckee emerges, carrying his brown leather bag. a shaky, tired kaufman approaches him.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{mr. mckee?}
<C>__{mckee}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i'm the guy you yelled at this morning.}
<C>__{mckee}
<P>__{(trying to recall)}
<D>__{i need more.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i was the one who thought things didn't happen in life.}
<C>__{mckee}
<D>__{oh, right, okay. nice to see you.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i need to talk.}
<C>__{mckee}
<D>__{i make it a rule not to give private tutorials to my seminar students. it wouldn't be fair to the others.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{mr. mckee, please. my even standing here is very scary. i don't meet people well. i'm self conscious and timid. but what you said this morning shook me to the bone. what you said was bigger than my screenwriting choices. it's about my choices as a human being. please.}
<A>__{mckee hesitates for a moment, then reaches out and puts his arm around kaufman.}
<C>__{mckee}
<D>__{i could use a drink, my friend.}
