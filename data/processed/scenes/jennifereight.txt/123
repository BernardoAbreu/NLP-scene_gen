<L>__{122: interior bedroom. berlin's house. night.}
<A>__{the camera will slowly crane down on berlin. fully dressed but wiped out he lays an the bad. last thing he needs is booze. he is clearly full of it. drifting in and out of consciousness. a nightmare either side of the line. he relives that night again. and ross is alive again as guilt and regret demand to be heard.}
<P>__{(ross)}
<D>__{you want me to make a predict ion? this guy ain't turning up.}
<P>__{(berlin)}
<D>__{maybe not .. what time is it?}
<P>__{(ross)}
<D>__{twenty six minutes past two ..}
<P>__{(berlin)}
<D>__{you shouldn't have come, ross.}
<P>__{(ross)}
<D>__{don't worry .. you take your time .. i just wanna be back in time for bobby's presents ..}
<A>__{a memory that is too terrible to bear. berlin gets up and sits at the edge of the bad. head in hands. wants the pain to go aw ay. but anguish is stronger than alcohol. hears noises outside and makes it to a window. tears curtains back revealing lights. his mercedes hangs in space as though staring into the bedroom.}
