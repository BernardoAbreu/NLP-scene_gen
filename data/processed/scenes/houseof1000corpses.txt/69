<L>__{interior farmhouse barn night}
<A>__{we follow mother inside. thousands of red christmas lights hang down, strung through the rotting wood rafters. crates, barrels and an odd assortment of chairs face a large quilted curtain. filling these seats are lifeless dummies.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{please be seated.}
<A>__{mother motions toward four empty seats in the front row.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{this is way too fucked up for words.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(loud whisper)}
<D>__{i know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{just grin and bear it.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{that food...}
<P>__{(holding stomach)}
<D>__{ugh, i feel like i'm gonna puke.}
<A>__{jerry, bill, mary and denise take their seats. mary flips open the program. inside, written in crayon, are the words: halloween extravaganza starring the comedy legend grampa and the world famous baby.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{check this out.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, ya can't complain i never take you anyplace.}
<A>__{the sound of a warped crackling record fills the room. lounge music. a small spotlight hits the quilted curtain covering the stage. mother firefly stands behind the controls. she is smiling proudly. the curtain clumsily parts to reveal: a stage set pieced together from amusement park wreckage. a giant painted plywood devil looms over the stage, surrounded by dancing skeletons and demon girls. a microphone stands center stage.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i can't believe what i'm seeing.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i know, this is fucking nuts.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{this is starting to make me real uncomfortable.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{just sit back and enjoy the show.}
<A>__{the sound of canned applause fills the room. bill begins to applaud, jerry and denise join in. mary does not.}
<C>__{grampa }
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, straight from his smash six week sold out run at tiki ti club... the stardust lounge is proud to present mr. sexy himself... grampa hugo.}
<A>__{grampa walks out to center stage, mic in hand and begins to speak.}
<C>__{grampa}
<D>__{hey, let me tell ya a story... so i'm hanging out with my buddy hal jackowictz and i'm like, hey hal let's go get some booze and chase the chickens... fucking hal says no, no the old battle axe at home will break my balls... i gotta get my ass home.}
<A>__{the kids stare in shock at grampa. jerry begins to laugh.}
<C>__{grampa}
<D>__{so, i tell 'im... hal, here's the secret. go home tonight, crawl into bed, get under the covers and eat your wife's pussy... i mean jam your face right in the bush.}
<A>__{jerry starts to giggle.}
<C>__{denise}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{what are you laughing at?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i don't know, i think he's funny.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{this isn't funny, it's twisted.}
<C>__{grampa}
<D>__{so, hal goes home, jumps in, starts chomping and licking away at her pussy, she's screaming and howling... totally passes out from the experience.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{dear god, let this end.}
<C>__{grampa}
<D>__{now, hal... he's feeling pretty good, so he goes into the bathroom for a quick shave...}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{...suddenly he lets out a horrible scream. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!}
<A>__{the recorded crowd chuckles.}
<C>__{grampa}
<D>__{sitting there on the toilet is hal's wife gloria... and she says, "quiet down, you'll wake grandma!"}
<A>__{the recorded crowd screams with laughter, as does jerry. bill, denise and mary look at him like he's crazy.}
<C>__{grampa}
<D>__{thank you, you're too kind, too kind... stay in your seats, coming up next we got something special for you men out there.}
<A>__{the curtains close and the stage goes dark.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{shit, i'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(looking at his watch)}
<D>__{man, it's already ten thirty.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm with denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{negative. shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{yeah, i'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. there's nothing else.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{i suppose. i mean they're obviously all bonkers, but i guess they're harmless.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i fucking hope so.}
<A>__{the stage lights come up. the recorded applause and music begin. baby enters the stage. she is dressed in a home made showgirl outfit. she begins to dance clumsily to the music. she appears to be somewhat intoxicated. the vocals come on and baby begins to lipsync to the song.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{you gotta be kidding me. this chick is wasted.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{shhhhhh.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{how much is a person supposed to stand?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(motioning for mary}
<D>__{to keep her voice}
<P>__{down)}
<D>__{quiet.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry, bothering you? was i disturbing your viewing pleasure?}
<A>__{baby makes her way down from stage on to floor level. she gyrates and seductively teases one of the dummy audience members. baby moves over to jerry. stroking her hand down his face. denise tries to look amused. jerry smiles uncomfortably. baby strolls past denise and stops in front of mary. baby pauses and pinches mary's cheek and winks. mary is}
<B>__{furious.}
<A>__{baby moves over to bill. mary watches like a mother hawk. baby sings and dances with all of her attention focused on bill. baby puts her arms around bill's neck and sits on his lap. mary bolts forward and shoves baby off of bill. baby crashes onto the floor.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{take that, you fucking slut!}
<P>__{(mary spits at baby)}
<D>__{fucking redneck whore!}
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{you shouldn't a done that.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{why? you gonna do something about it?}
<C>__{baby}
<P>__{(standing up)}
<D>__{yeah, i will do something.}
<A>__{baby takes out a straight razor from behind her back.}
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{i will cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{baby! stop!}
<A>__{mrs. firefly runs down from her position behind the spotlight and intercedes.}
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{no, i told you...}
<A>__{screech! the garage door slides open. rufus has returned.}
<C>__{rufus jr.}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{car's done.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{thank god.}
<C>__{mother}
