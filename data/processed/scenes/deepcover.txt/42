<L>__{interior courtroom night}
<A>__{hull is led in with other handcuffed prisoners. carver is here, catches hull's eye. hull shakes his head; doesn't want carver to intercede. a woman public defender (26, attractive, harried) addresses the prisoners.}
<C>__{public defender}
<D>__{hi, i'm shelley weissbrod. this is only an arraignment, a preliminary hearing, but if you don't have money for an attorney, the public defender's office can...}
<A>__{hull is listening to this when a bailiff taps his shoulder.}
<C>__{bailiff}
<D>__{you've got counsel. over there.}
<A>__{puzzled, hull sees the back of a suit conferring with a prosecutor. the suit turns. it's david elias who smiles, offers his hand. hull is stunned. elias enjoys that.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{you're a lawyer??}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{i'm your lawyer.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{who hired you?}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{it's pro bono. if you don't want me, there's shelley. she's good. she just can't provide special services...}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{voice }
<P>__{(calling the next case)}
<D>__{john hull...}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{getting your case called first.}
<A>__{elias addressing the court.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{your honor, i believe the preliminary police toxicology report will show that the substance seized from my client was mannitol, a baby laxative. we move for immediate dismissal.}
<A>__{hull is surprised at this news. the judge looks to the prosecutor who waives objection. gavel.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(continuing; to hull)}
<D>__{we're out of here, dude.}
<A>__{as they walk toward the back, taft approaches hull. there's already a deep pull between these two, and in taft's presence, hull can't sustain the tough street act. we almost see the little boy inside him.}
<C>__{taft}
<P>__{(to hull, amused)}
<D>__{baby laxative, they sold you some bad shit.}
<C>__{drunken prisoner}
<P>__{(to hull)}
<D>__{you have a constipated baby, and you're in jail? what kind of a father are you?}
<C>__{taft}
<D>__{a father who don't know his own children, ain't that right?}
<A>__{a long look between them, broken when elias takes hull's arm, leads him away. elias cheerfully greets a couple of hookers waiting arraignment. hull furtively grabs his sleeve.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{you sold me mannitol, motherfucker.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(under his)}
<D>__{if it hadn't been, asshole, you'd be in jail right now... come on, i want you to meet some people.}
