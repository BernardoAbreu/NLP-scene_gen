<LOC>__{EXT. BOREAL FOREST - ALASKA - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Flying. Not at the intangible height of a jet, but at spitting distance from the treetops. We're in central Alaska, the Big Lonely, just north of the Arctic Circle. A thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills like a deep-pile carpet. Up at treeline the forest thins to tundra, a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the coming of autumn. On the horizon, the hills rise to meet the Endicott Mountains, a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and jagged that snow cannot stick to its face. This is how all North America once looked -- raw, indomitable. Then, abruptly coming into the SCENE is a colossal etching across the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin. Bisecting this country like a metallic ribbon -- or a scar, depending on your point of view -- is the 800-mile-long Trans-Alaskan Pipeline. Even the immensity of the pipeline is rendered insignificant by the vastness of the land. It goes on, and on, and on...}
<TRANS>__{DISSOLVE TO:}
<ACTION>__{A lone MAN walks along the Haul Road, a one-lane gravel trail running parallel to the pipeline. The weather turns sour -- rough wind and stinging snow cut across the man's path.}
<TRANS>__{DISSOLVE TO:}
<ACTION>__{The man is ERIC DESMOND, twenty-four, clean-shaven, determined. He's clearly out of place here, dressed in a business suit and a light, camel-hair topcoat. Eric is trying to follow some footprints in the snow -- a predator's tracks, those of a wolf or coyote. But the footprints ahead have faded, covered by the snow and wind.}
<TRANS>__{DISSOLVE TO:}
<ACTION>__{The weather becomes more oppressive. Heavy snow, gale winds and sub-zero temperatures make his progress tortuous. Eric strives stubbornly forward.}
<TRANS>__{DISSOLVE TO:}
<ACTION>__{Eric has gathered some branches. He tries to make a fire. Moisture from his breath has frozen in the upturned collar of his insufficient coat, and his skin is split raw from the cold. His hands are too numb to hold the matches. After several attempts at striking one, he slumps down next to the pile of wood, exhausted and frustrated.}
<TRANS>__{DISSOLVE TO:}
<ACTION>__{The snow has covered the pile of branches. Eric still sits next to it, partially covered in snow himself.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ERIC}
<ACTION>__{His face is a death mask: eyes half-open and dull, lips a purplish blue, bloodless skin crystallizing as it ices over. The wind HOWLS around him. The snow sticks to his eyelashes and hair without melting.}

<LOC>__{INT. DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Eric bolts up in bed. Next to him, ANNE MARIE GAUVIN sits up and hugs him. All that can be seen of her in the dark is a lovely silhouette and a cascade of dark hair. After a moment, Eric kisses her. He shakes off the dream and lies back down.}

<ACTION>__{Eric walks quietly past the sign, intent on something ahead of him. Although still somewhat boyish in appearance, he's confident and resolute in attitude. His clothes have a distinctly western feel: Lucchese boots, Levis 501's, Mahan cotton shirt. His down parka is unzipped in the sunny, windless, forty-degree afternoon. He pauses, then brings to his shoulder a rifle with a four-power scope mounted atop it. He peers through the scope. HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE He puts the crosshairs on the shoulder flank of a big, ivory-white timber wolf, fifty yards away.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{BACK TO SCENE}
<ACTION>__{Anne Marie stands beside Eric, a Nikon with a telephoto lens in her hand, holding her breath in anticipation. She's twenty-three, pretty, with soft features and piercing blue eyes. She wears Eddie Bauer woman's gear like she was born in it. Eric expertly fixes his aim and slowly squeezes the trigger. But instead of a loud retort, there is only the dull POP of a CO2-powered dart gun.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{NEW ANGLE}
<ACTION>__{The tranquilizer dart finds its mark in the wolf's fleshy shoulder. The wolf takes off running, but almost immediately slows, sits, then lies down. Eric and Anne Marie hurry over to the wolf, who is breathing deeply. Eric kneels next to him and strokes his thick fur.}

<ACTION>__{Anne Marie passes to Eric a tiny, weatherproof homing device attached to a steel collar band. Eric puts the collar loosely around the wolf's neck and crimps it in place, all the while TALKING soothingly to the semi-conscious animal. Anne Marie smiles at Eric's tenderness and snaps some photos. With the collar in place and transmitter activated, Eric backs away while the wolf tries to rouse itself from its narcosis.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{NEW ANGLE}
<ACTION>__{Anne Marie is taping the wolf's retreat. Looking through the viewfinder, she crosses a gully between a pipeline piling and a rock formation. Eric turns toward her and a glint of light in the debris at her feet catches his eye.}

He's dressed in a brown long coat and has a Colt .45 Peacemaker in a quick-draw holster strapped to his leg. Despite his intimidating air, confrontation is not his style.

He's BEN CORBETT, a life-long huntsman, somewhere past forty, weathered beyond his years. He has a feral nose, thick beard and dark, smart, hunter's eyes. He wears a hooded cotton sweat shirt, cotton coveralls and vapor-barrier mountain boots. On his belt is a holster rig cradling a .44 magnum revolver. Eric slows down. He didn't expect to face anyone as formidable as Corbett.}

Now only a few itinerant loggers, natives and bush dwellers remain to fight boredom, each other and the depression of the oncoming winter. Enough steam escapes from the hot springs to perpetually blanket the valley with fog. The spa is log-walled and horseshoe- shaped, with partitioned baths inside.

With a casual swipe of its paw, its massive claws puncture the Turtle's aluminum skin, popping open the door of the utility compartment. The bear pokes its head inside, and Wilder's body slumps out into the snow. The bear pushes at the corpse with its snout. Salivating, it prepares to dig in. Anne Marie looks around, wondering what the hell to do nEXT. Wilder's snowmobile is a few yards behind her, parked against the side of the Turtle. She inches toward it. Testily, the bear looks up, SNIFFING loudly. Keeping her eyes on the bear, Anne Marie feels for the snowmobile ignition keys. They're not there. She feels around inside the saddlebags and finds three emergency road flares. Anne Marie IGNITES the flares. They illuminate the area with an eerie reddish glow. She YELLS at the bear, wields the flares like Excalibur and moves forward. The bear, reluctant to leave so hearty a pre-hibernation meal, GROWLS and cocks its head back and forth to assess the threat. As Anne Marie inches ahead, the bear stands on hind legs to its full height to meet the challenge. Anne Marie tosses a flare toward the bear. It grunts when the flare hits it, and shuffles backwards. Anne Marie throws another flare. With a ROAR from hell, the bear charges. Anne Marie falls back. Still holding the last flare, she's forced into a crawl space under the Turtle. ANGLE - UNDER THE TURTLE Anne Marie tries to squeeze out the other side, but she's pinned in by the unevenness of the hard ground. The bear swipes at her, its huge paw inches away. Anne Marie jabs at the paw with the flare, but that only makes the bear more quarrelsome. She twists around, looking for a defense. Above her is the cabling from the generator to the circuit box for the Turtle's electrical system. She tugs at it, but it won't budge. The bear SNIFFS at Anne Marie with its big wet snout.

She tosses one end of a hundred feet of nylon rope over a sturdy tree branch twenty-five feet from the ground. Then she throws the other end over an opposing branch and stretches the rope like a clothesline. She attaches a second length of rope perpendicular to the first and throws it over a third tree branch, midway between the other two. She kneels and ties something BELOW FRAME to the cross-length rope. Pulling mightily on the perpendicular rope, she hoists something heavy to the level of the branches. The flare burns out, plunging the area into darkness. Anne Marie wraps the rope around the tree trunk and nervously tries to LIGHT another flare.

Suddenly, a string of overhead lights come on. Eric goes for the .357, then stops when he sees Meyerling, Kenai and Neff have come in the front door. Kenai stomps his feet and shivers. Grandstanding for the others, Meyerling steps forward.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{NEW ANGLE}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly, LeMalle stumbles into the depot, the blankets and furs dragging at his feet. His right side is bathed in blood. Half-frozen, bled dry, he looks ready to drop down dead. In his left hand, impossibly, he still clutches the massive Remington. He hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he BOLTS a round into the chamber with his injured right arm. Bracing himself, he levels the rifle at Eric. Hearing the ACTION of the rifle, Eric turns. Corbett reaches down, grabs a rusty Eskimo spear in both his handcuffed hands, and hurls it. There is a deafening ROAR as LeMalle's rifle discharges. LeMalle flies back from the recoil -- and from the spear stuck clear through his chest. Some packing material above Eric's head smolders, ignited by the muzzle blast.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{NEW ANGLE}
<ACTION>__{There is a moment of silence. Corbett looks at the other weapons near him, and then at Meyerling. Threatened, Meyerling pulls out a .380 automatic. Before Eric can do anything, Meyerling FIRES. The IMPACT of the bullet throws Corbett against some boxes. With a YELL, Eric jumps Meyerling and rips the gun from his grasp. Enraged, he pummels Meyerling with it until Kenai and Neff pull them apart. Eric wrenches away from them and scrambles to his feet with Meyerling's gun in his hand.}
