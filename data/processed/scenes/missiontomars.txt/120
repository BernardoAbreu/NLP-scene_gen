<L>__{interior greenhouse. day}
<A>__{an inner airlock door whooshes open, and mcconnell enters. then stops, astonished. his pov on a fantastic, almost jungle like atmosphere. the plants have been allowed encouraged? to grow wildly. some are even pushing against the inflated roof. water condenses on the leaves and the roof, then is captured and routed through pipes of every shape and size, dripping into a clever assortment of collection jars. liquid water.}
<B>__{mcconnell}
<A>__{reaches into a bucket, touches the water. his glove comes up before his wondering eyes, dripping. grasping the implication, he looks down at his forearm instrument pad. blinking red letters read "25 deg. c." and something else the puffy white material of his suit is starting to slightly deflate, revealing his arm's shape. there's air pressure in here!}
<B>__{mcconnell}
<A>__{punches in more numbers, and gets the readout: "nitr. 78% 02 20% c02 1% trace gasses 1%."}
<B>__{mcconnell}
<A>__{slowly reaches up, unsealing the neck ring of his helmet. he hesitates, then lifts it off. takes a deep, quenching lungful of pure air. holds it in. lets it slowly out. for a moment he doesn't trust his own voice. then speaks softly towards his helmet.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{i'm in the greenhouse. you better... you better come see this for yourselves.}
