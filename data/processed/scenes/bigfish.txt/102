<L>__{exterior sorority house day}
<A>__{edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half open door. through the crack we can see the edge of a young woman, talking in hushed tones with another girl we can't see. finally, a decision is reached. the door opens to reveal the woman of edward's dreams, sandra kay templeton. she's effortlessly beautiful, pure and simple as sunlight. he can't believe he's finally reached her. he half laughs, nervous. that makes her laugh, not sure what's going on.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you don't know me, but my name is edward bloom and i am in love with you. i've spent the last three years working to find out who you are. i've been shot and stabbed and trampled a few times, had my ribs broken twice, but it's all worth it to see you here, now, and to finally get to talk to you. because i am destined to marry you. i knew that from the first moment i saw you at the circus. and i know it now more than ever.}
<A>__{on sandra, overwhelmed. all she can finally think of to say is...}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{don't need to apologize to me. i mean, i'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...}
<A>__{she puts her hand on the door frame. on her left ring finger, we see a diamond.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{no i'm sorry, i... i'm engaged to be married.}
<A>__{on edward as his heart falls 20 floors. he tries to suppress the reaction, put on a brave front.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{but you're wrong. i do know you, at least by reputation. edward bloom from ashton. see, i'm actually engaged to a boy from ashton. don price. he was a few years older than you.}
