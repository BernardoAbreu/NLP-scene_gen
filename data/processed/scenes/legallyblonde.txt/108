<L>__{interior emmett 's volvo day}
<A>__{emmett drives, raving.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{how can you still believe she's innocent?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{you're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? she's ly ing.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{and you know this for a fact?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{did you see the icky black color of her hair?}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{i never trust a woman who's not blonde. except for my friend serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. that's the whole reason i ' m starting the blonde legal defense fund.}
<A>__{he looks at her and laughs.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{the what?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{blondes are discriminated against worldwide! brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. if she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "oh, the poor widow."}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{you're serious?}
<A>__{she's fired up now.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{you should see the way i ' m treated in class! i'm a complete source of mockery. this is why the blonde legal defense fund is needed.}
<A>__{he goes along with it, won over by her enthusiasm.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{okay, how would it work?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{it would be a full service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. i mean, think about it — name one blonde intellectual role model.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{— i can't.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{that is a direct result of anti blonde discrimination!}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{wait — hilary clinton.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{if she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.}
<A>__{emmett frowns.}
<C>__{emm ett}
<D>__{in that case, maybe heyworth got — fellated —by a brunette and brooke caught him.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty year old man can take?}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{that's not really a topic that keeps me up at night — but maybe it should.}
<A>__{elle digs in her purse.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{speaking of that •— i bought you some seaweed cream while we were at the spa.}
<A>__{she hands it to him. he keeps his hands on the wheel, not taking it.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{what the hell is that for?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{the bags under your eyes. you're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{i don't}
<P>__{(gesturing to the cream)}
<D>__{do that stuff.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{well, you should —. i f you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{projecting joy is not my job.}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{fine. sorry i brought it up.}
<A>__{she puts the cream back in her purse. they ride in silence for a moment. then —}
<C>__{emmett}
<D>__{you really think i ' m attractive?}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{for a butt head? yes.}
<A>__{she smiles at him.}
