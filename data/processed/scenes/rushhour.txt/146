<L>__{interior north korean consulate ambassador han's office day}
<A>__{the clock reads 3:50 pm. carson, miranda, robbins, sabatini, ambassador han and colonel lee are all talking at once.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(to walther)}
<D>__{...scrounge us some bodies: national guard, state troopers, chps, local pd's, meter maids }
<C>__{walther}
<D>__{ they're gonna search the whole city in a goddamn hour..?!}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{look, i don't need you to tell me how fucked we are!}
<C>__{walther}
<D>__{fuck you!! every time you're on a case something explodes!}
<A>__{carson looks like he's going to explode. before he can reply:}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{stop! the clock's running! arguing is a luxury we can't afford! more }
<C>__{miranda }
<P>__{(looks at carson)}
<D>__{what's done is done. there'll be plenty of time to point fingers later.}
<A>__{carson would love to get into it, but he lets it slide. he looks sabatini, wandering aimlessly with javal's severed hand.}
<C>__{sabatini}
<D>__{i need some fuckin' ink!!}
<A>__{carson grabs one of the expensive pens from ambassador han's desk, snaps it in half, and hands it to her. in the b.g. she stands at the credenza, inks the hand's fingers and thumb and rolls them onto a piece of letterhead paper.}
<C>__{ambassador han}
<D>__{this is impossible! how can you even begin to find them?}
<A>__{good question. all eyes go to miranda.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{well, the normal procedure is to negotiate with the perpetrator...}
<A>__{her head is spinning. she looks at carson.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{let's take stock. we've got a picture of where he hid the family, and recordings of his calls }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{ that's right! we can send them to our experts for analysis...}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(to ambassador han)}
<D>__{same with his fingerprints. but that means we need high quality image and data transmission. we can piss away ten minutes coptering this shit to our offices in westwood, or we can use your surveillance equipment.}
<C>__{colonel lee}
<D>__{there is no surveillance equipment. this is a diplomatic facility }
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{ you want to play games, fine.}
<A>__{he turns to go. ambassador han turns to colonel lee.}
<C>__{ambassador han}
<D>__{take them upstairs.}
