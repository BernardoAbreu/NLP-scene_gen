<L>__{exterior nix's house desert day}
<A>__{the two vehicles come to a halt outside nix's house. from the thunderbird steps philip swann, a nineteen year old with shoulder length hair and brilliant blue eyes. he's not conventionally handsome, but he's certainly striking. from the passenger seat steps caspar quaid, a black man, studious and intense. from the bus emerges murray pimm, skinny and jittery, and jennifer desiderio, a woman with a steely gaze.}
<C>__{swann}
<P>__{(to all three)}
<D>__{are we ready?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(cool)}
<D>__{say the word.}
<C>__{pimm}
<P>__{(very nervous)}
<D>__{look, maybe we should think this over.}
<A>__{on swann, as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces of metalwork. we get only a tantalizing glimpse of them, as he slips them into his pocket.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{no. he's gone too far.}
<C>__{pimm}
<D>__{so he took a child.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{he'll kill her.}
<C>__{pimm}
<D>__{no he won't.}
<C>__{swann}
<P>__{(determined)}
<D>__{he's not going to get the chance.}
<A>__{quaid checks a gun, then slips it into his belt.}
<C>__{quaid}
<D>__{if he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{so stay out here.}
<A>__{swann starts towards the house. jennifer is the first to follow, with the other two on her heels.}
