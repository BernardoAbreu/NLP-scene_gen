<C>__{toby}
<D>__{being close and being clever ain't like being true, i don't need to, i won't never hide a thing from you, like some.}

<P>__{(calming)}
<D>__{... how could you think such a thing of mr. todd, who's been so good to us?}

<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{nothing's gonna harm you, not while i'm around. nothing's gonna harm you, darling, not while i'm around.}
<P>__{(he leans into her)}
<D>__{demons'll charm you with a smile for a while, but in time nothing's gonna harm you, not while i'm around.}

<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{funny we should be having this little chat right now ... 'cause i was just thinkin', you know how you've always fancied coming into the bakehouse with me to help make the pies?}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(dreamily)}
