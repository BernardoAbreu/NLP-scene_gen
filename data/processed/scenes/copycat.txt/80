<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{i know; the kid hit you first. he already told me.}
<C>__{nikko}
<D>__{he's not treating her right...}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{she left you, nikko. she's not your responsibility. she takes very good care of herself. if she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business. your business is to snap out of it.}
<C>__{nikko}
<D>__{we were together six years, sir!}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{don't give me six years! you never divorced patty, did you? so what'd you expect from m.j.?}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{plus i got real problems. i'm worried i might have to put you in over m.j. there's something going on here, the commissioner is targeting her now, i can't leave a woman in that position. but the thing is, how can i move you in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?}
<C>__{nikko}

<C>__{quinn}
