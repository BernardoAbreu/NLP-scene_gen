<A>__{a family room with all the trappings of the era: a flagstone fireplace, a console tv, a man's leatherette barca lounger, a pipe stand holding two pipes on a nearby table, boxes of children's games neatly stacked on a wall shelf. a young mother, carol, her hair in a pony tail, stands at a picture window in a corner of the family room, staring mildly at the scene outside. carol's pov a little girl a little girl bounces a red ball on the sidewalk. the ball gets away from her, and rolls into the street. at the same moment, a two toned chevy, lush and huge, rounds the corner. the girl sees the car coming, but still goes after the ball.}

<B>__{inside the chevy}
<A>__{the driver a man in a loose fitting dark green suit, white shirt, thin brown tie sits behind the steering wheel of the car. disturbingly, the man's hands are not on the steering wheel. not only that, he is holding the morning newspaper up in front of him, reading, oblivious to the scene before him. through the windshield, we see the little girl in the road in front of him, going for her ball. carol watches, her smile in place.}

<A>__{the car has stopped, inches from the girl. the girl giggles as, the man in the car gives her a big wink. she waves, then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball. the man goes back to his newspaper, and the car, entirely on its own, starts up again. the car rounds a corner, and disappears.}

<A>__{he takes another step toward her. she doesn't move a muscle. a little boy suddenly enters the room. johnny turns, looks at his son, looks back over his shoulder at his wife. then, without a word, he begins to walk out of the room. on his way out, johnny's eyes flick to carol's sewing basket, which sits beside a sewing machine. it is not the sewing that has caught his attention, but a large pair of garment scissors which lie across a fold of colored cloth.}
