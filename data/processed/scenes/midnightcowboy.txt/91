<A>__{ratso bursts from the hotel, almost running as he disappears.}
<L>__{interior west side hotel corridor dusk}
<A>__{joe finds 901 at a dark end of the corridor, knocks confidently, hearing a few bars of his love theme as he stuffs a fresh stick of gum in his mouth. then the door is thrown open by o'daniel for an instant appearing to wear a diamond studded skull cap, the naked overhead light bulb bright after the dark corridor, halating in joe's eyes like the earlier dollar sign.}
<C>__{o'daniel}
<D>__{you must be joe buck. come in.}
<A>__{o'daniel, fat in a worn out bathrobe, examines joe like a prodigal son as he leads him into the room as anonymous as joe's own room.}
<C>__{o'daniel }
<D>__{am i tickled to find you, boy! come on in and let's get a look at you. turn around. good strong back. you'll need it. so you want help take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. cowboy, huh?}

<D>__{no sir, i'm no cowboy really, but i'm a first class stud.}
<C>__{o'daniel}
<D>__{take it,easy, boy...}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but i'd say you knew exactly what you want.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you bet i do, sir.}
<C>__{o'daniel}
<D>__{but i will bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. i will bet you're lonesome.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, not too, i mean, a little.}
<A>__{o'daniel rises suddenly in a fury of self righteousness, pacing, his voice simpering, whining sarcastically.}
<C>__{o'daniel}
<D>__{i'm lonesome. i'm lonesome so i'm a drunk. i'm lonesome so i'm a dope fiend. i'm lonesome so i'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore monger. poop, i say, poop! i've heard it all and i'm sick of it, sick to death.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yessir, i can see that.}
<C>__{o'daniel}
<D>__{lonesomeness is something you take. you bear? dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, uh, i'm raring to go.}
<C>__{o'daniel}
<D>__{yes, i believe you are. cowboy, huh?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{uh, yessir.}
<C>__{o'daniel}
<D>__{ready for hard work, son?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ready for anything.}
<C>__{o'daniel}
<D>__{i got a hunch, joe buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{gonna be like money from home.}
<C>__{o'daniel}
<D>__{money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. i warn you i'm gonna use you, i'm gonna run you ragged!}
<A>__{joe laughs, driving an obscene uppercut into the air. o'daniel laughs with him.}
<C>__{o'daniel }
<D>__{you're a wonderful boy. you'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{get down where?}
<C>__{o'daniel}
<D>__{right here, why not? i prayed in saloons, i prayed in the street, i prayed an the toilet. he don't care where, what he wants is that prayer.}
<A>__{o'daniel drops on all fours, crawling to find the plug of an electric cord. he shoves it into a wall socket, switches off the overhead light and suddenly a hollow, tinted plastic jesus glows on the dresser. o.s. a revivalist congregation sings. and now we notice, with joe, placards and flags, horns and tracts, all the paraphernalia of a street corner evangelist.}
<C>__{job}
<D>__{shee it...}
<C>__{o'daniel}
<D>__{that's the ticket, just open your heart and let it flow. it ain't the words, it's the love beyond 'em!}
