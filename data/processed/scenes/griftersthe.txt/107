<L>__{interior motel room day}
<A>__{a clean anonymous holiday inn. lilly, dressed for the track, sits at the round table under the swag light, sorting through her business purse. there's a folded newspaper on the table. knock on the door. she's startled. for just a second, she's like a trapped animal. then she's calm again. she turns the purse around, opens another zipper section, removes a pistol and a silencer, quickly screws the silencer onto the pistol, lays the pistol on the table and covers it with the newspaper. then she crosses to open the door. an angle to include roy in the doorway, grinning, easy. lilly's surprised, pleased, but wary.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{roy! what are you doing in san diego?}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(entering)}
<D>__{myra and me come down to lajolla for the weekend.}
<A>__{lilly makes a face, but no comment, at myra's name, as she closes the door.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{if you come out to the track, don't know me.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{we won't hit the track. the beach. couple a nice restaurants.}
<A>__{he takes from his pockets the wads of money held removed from the clown pictures, extends them toward her.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{four grand. for the hospital. is that enough?}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(distressed)}
<D>__{roy, i don't want money from you.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i pay my debts.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(level skeptical look)}
<D>__{you do?}
<A>__{since she won't take the money, he turns to put it on the table beside her purse, pushing the newspaper out of the way, revealing the gun. he gives it a surprised smile.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{expecting visitors?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{no. that was the pointerior}
<A>__{she crosses to unscrew the silencer and put both pieces back in her purse. roy, watching, points at the still angry burn on her hand.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you ought to put a bandage on that.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{no can do. have to dip in and out of my bag too much. besides, it'll heal in the air.}
<A>__{disdainful and hurt, she pushes at the wads of money.}
<C>__{lilly }
<D>__{roy, take that back.}
<A>__{his own hostility shows through.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she's not used to being vulnerable, can neither hide it nor really express it; can't use it as a tactic.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i thought... i was hoping we could play it straight with one another.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i guess not. you'll be heading east from here, huh?}

<D>__{well... nice to see you again, lilly.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{you, too, roy.}
<A>__{roy finds this parting unsatisfactory, but has nothing to add. with a shrug, he leaves. lilly looks after him, her expression becoming resentful, dully angry.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{prick.}
