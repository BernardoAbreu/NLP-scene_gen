<A>__{epps makes it to the far side of the broken pass. he holds out a hand to wes and reels him in. together they both help bring in jaeger. wes looks back over the path they've just crossed.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{the us army: always an adventure.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{let me see the map.}
<A>__{jaeger hands the map to epps who gives it a going over. they}
<B>__{walk as they talk.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{should be easy going from here. stay on the pass straight to the dot.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what do you figure it to be?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{x marks the spot.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{but the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i hope it means something, otherwise...}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{basically. but the map has been pretty precise so far. i don't think it'll be too hard to }
<A>__{our boys step past a grouping of rocks. they stop dead. sitting before them, in what looks like a small camp, is five iraqi soldiers. time clicks by real slow for an instant. it's a delayed reaction, like the beat it takes after you pick up a hot pan before you realize that, yeah, it is burning the flesh from your hand.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{take cover!}
<A>__{our three soldiers turn and bolt back the way they came. they run like wild rabbits for a bit, jumping over a rock formation and hitting the deck using the rocks as cover. like well trained warriors they peel their weapons from their shoulders, lock and load, and stand ready. they wait a bit, taking several deep breaths like divers about to go under. finally epps gives the order.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{let's hit 'em!}
<A>__{simultaneously they spring up from behind the rocks and bear down on the iraqis with their m 16s ready to blow them to kingdom come. one problem: no iraqis. for a beat our three don't move. they hold position, breath coming hard like sprinters at the end of a race. they're eyes flint back and forth scanning for something...anything. there's nothing.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{cover me.}
<A>__{m 16 still at the ready, epps raises up taking a tactical stance. he inches forward, sweeping his weapon back and forth before him for any potential target. there is none. the iraqis have vanished. epps lowers the m 16, but does not shoulder it.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{clear.}
<A>__{wes and jaeger come up from their cover and cross to epps. they keep their weapons ready. eerily they all look around as if trying to spot ghosts.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{where'd they go?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i don't know. there's a lot of space up here. they could be just about }
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{weird they didn't chase us.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{just seems weird they didn't chase us.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what's weird is how they disappeared. doesn't make sense. doesn't...}
<A>__{there is a sound; a steady swooshing that starts faint and grows closer like a rolling thunder. our three start looking around, turning where they stand, trying to find the source of the sound as it rises to a near deafening pitch. there's nothing. they see nothing. still the sound races closer and closer. epps, jaeger and wes raise up their weapons in preparation to defend themselves against this unseen beast. from below the edge of the mesa a helicopter gunship probably a mil mi 24 hind d armed assault helicopter if you want to be technical raises up very dramatically into sight. it hangs in the air ominously before our soldiers. on board are the vanished iraqis wearing nasty grins. the pilot brings the gunship about and levels her massive machine cannons at our boys.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{scatter!}
<A>__{wes and jaeger don't have to be told twice. they bolt from their spots, and not an instant too soon. the gunner lets fly a barrage of shells that literally tear up the ground where our boys were just standing. we see what the chopter's weapons will do to rock. we can imagine what they would do to flesh. epps, jaeger and wes take cover behind some rocks. the gunship swings around, picks up speed and bears down on them. more shells fired. they punch into and through the rocks our boys use for cover. again the three scatter, and just in time as the shells rip their way through the rock. our three go sliding down an embankment, crouching low. their heads whip around looking for the gunship.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{where is it? where'd it go?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{stay low.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{where the hell is it!?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{just stay down.}
<A>__{in answer to jaeger's question the gunship comes swooping up behind them like a bird of prey. our three have all of about a second to get running before the iraqis send more shells their way. they kick up chunks of rock as they ping, ping, ping around epps, wes and jaeger who make a wild, evasive run. dig it: up ahead is a narrow passage through rock face. they race for it, hurl themselves into it as the gunship sends a special delivery of white hot metal their way. once inside the passage they have a bit of breathing space. it's too narrow for the gunship to get a good shot through. our three press themselves up against the rock walls and suck air. beyond the opening to the passage the gunship swings back and forth like a junkyard dog patrolling its kingdom. jaeger's worked up a real scare.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what are we going to do? what the hell are we going to do?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we're not going to do anything.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<P>__{(panicked)}
<D>__{they're going to kill us!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{they can't shoot us in here.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{and they can't fly around out there forever.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{so we wait.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{if they land }
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{if they land, we can take them. if they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.}
<A>__{wes watches the gunship as it seemingly settles in the air. it floats very steady as if... wes' eyes key in on something: the gunship's missile pods rotating slightly, coming in line... wes' eyes go wide like someone just jammed an electric cattle prod in his ass.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{missile!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{move!}
<A>__{epps, wes and jaeger sprint for the opening at the far end of the passage as a missile rockets from the gunship's pod. with a wild whine it rides the wind like a deadly arrow straight into the passage. slamming into the ground it sprouts a terrific fireball that rides on a massive explosion. it races through the passage, lifts our boys from the ground and tosses them out into the open like they were nothing more than discarded ragdolls. jaeger takes cover and cowers. he puts his panic into overdrive. wes pulls his rifle. grunting like an animal he sprays bullets at the chopter, but it's like throwing snowballs at an elephant. the gunship turns on wes and fires in his direction. it doesn't hit him, but it sends him running. epps has had enough of this shit. he scrambles to load a grenade in his launcher as the gunship comes about. it races for him, cannons at the ready. this one is going to be close. epps locks and loads just as the chopter swings down on him. epps fires, but the gunship simply jukes up and away from the grenade the way someone might step over a bug. the grenade impacts the rock face behind the chopter exploding harmlessly. the chopter returns the favor by reining down a hail of shells that kicks epps back flipping him up and over the edge of the plateau. his m 16 goes flying, smashing into the ground far below. epps manages to grab hold of the plateau lip with one hand. it swings him around, slamming him hard against the cliff face. he hangs there, suspended by his weakening grip, far above the ground.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epps!}
<A>__{jaeger and wes run to him, grabbing him by his arm. they pull and pull hard until epps can get some kind of purchase, and crawl his way back up to the plateau. at the same time the gunship lowers itself so that it hovers above and beyond our three. it rotates so that the bay doors are facing epps, wes and jaeger. three iraqis are inside, weapons trained on our targets. one of them yells something. wes translates.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{they want us to surrender.}
<A>__{the three share a nervous look. epps fairly growls:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{yeah, i will surrender.}
<A>__{jaeger and wes watch as, shielded by their bodies, epps palms a grenade from his belt. wes and jaeger don't quite smile, but they know now they at least have a chance. as epps stands the other two turn to face the iraqis. they all fold their hands behind their necks which, for epps, hides the grenade from view. slowly they walk towards the gunship. one of the iraqis starts to yell something. he lifts his weapon and aims it at our boys. with his thumb epps yanks the pin from the grenade and lets fly. it's a perfect toss, landing in the chopter's bay. the iraqis see the grenade land, they scramble for it. one of them grabs it up and is about to throw it back out of the gunship. too late. the grenade explodes in the iraqi's hand killing him instantly. it also touches off a fire ball that severely damages the gunship. it rocks, lists, spins wildly out of control.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{get down!}
<A>__{our three hug the ground as the chopter's rotors go whipping through the air like throwing knifes landing perilously among them. worse still the gunship, now a lame bird, drops from the sky towards epps, jaeger and wes. all they can do is cover their heads, as if that would do any good against two tons of crashing steel. the chopter rushes down...down, but it just misses them. it slams into the ground skipping over the edge of the plateau, to the rocks below. our three pick themselves up. they walk to the edge of the plateau and look down on the crash. jaeger, scared painted all over his face, sinks to his knees and looks as if he's about to go into shock.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{oh, god...}
<A>__{wes looks down at jaeger with a bit of a disdainful sneer.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{yeah. just keeps getting better and better, doesn't it?}
<A>__{they stare for awhile, then one by one move off. us? we:}
