<D>__{excuse me, sir! you gave me a fright.}
<C>__{beadle}
<D>__{not my intention, good madam, though i am here on official business.}
<P>__{(elaborately prepares a pinch of snuff)}
<D>__{you see, there's been complaints. about the stink from your chimney. they say at night, it's something most foul. health regulations and the general public welfare, naturally being my duty, i'm afraid i will have to take a look ...}
