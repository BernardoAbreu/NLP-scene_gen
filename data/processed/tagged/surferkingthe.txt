<A>__{jaffa, a jamaican looking fellow in his early 20's, arrives at water world, carrying a dusty cardboard box. there are a few workers milling about, setting up the park for opening. he passes eddie, a 25 something grounds worker with down's syndrome.}

<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(smiling, nodding)}
<D>__{jaffa.}
<A>__{they do a hand slap maneuver that they have obviously worked out some time in the past. jaffa proceeds up to the customer relations kiosk, plops the box on the counter, and enters the kiosk. we see him open the box, it is full of cd's. he pulls winter covers off of an overhead area to reveal a cd player and amplifiers. he starts pushing buttons he's pushed a thousand times, and lights come on. he pulls down a microphone, and clicks a button to see if it works. he reaches into the box of cds and pulls one out. we see it is sheryl crow. he gets the cd, examines it, and pops it into the cd player. he once again picks the microphone and flips the switch as he pushes the "play" button on the cd player. his voice echoes through the park. "soak up the sun" begins playing.}

<L>__{ext early morning thunder bay}
<A>__{big mike, the park's owner manager a 50 something man who is portly and bald, and richard thompson, head lifeguard and another guard are on the east side of thunder bay. there is a post with a box on top of it that has a winter cover on it. the guard is standing there with a garden hose holding it so the water goes into thunder bay. he is obviously tired, and has been standing there a long time. we look back at the massive size of the pool and get the joke. big mike and richard pull off the winter cover. the guard turns to look and the hose turns with him, getting big mike wet. they object and he turns back to filling thunder bay. richard moves the guard to a safe distance. big mike blows the dust off of the box at the top of the post, and we see it is a large push button. big mike looks at richard who nods "go ahead" and then pushes the button. they both draw back as if something big should happen, but nothing. they look at each other and big mike motions for richard to go over to the wall housing the wave tank for the pool. richard waves ok, and big mike pushes the button again. when nothing happens, richard whacks the side of the tank with his closed fist. suddenly a huge wave rolls out. nodding his approval, big mike checks off an item in his clipboard.}
<L>__{exterior early morning. day surfs up area}
<A>__{we see people working to open the park. the vail precision lawn chair drill team dressed in water world uniforms is setting and arranging chairs in time to the music. they perform precision maneuvers with the chairs, as if rifles, and cross each other in a timed march to the music.}
<L>__{exterior early morning. day fun house area}
<A>__{big mike is standing under the fun house structure with a clipboard. he is talking to richard. after talking to big mike, richard shakes his head affirmatively and walks off. he glances up to the two guards above, and grins. big mike is looking at his clipboard. we see quickly the large water tank above is spilling water a bit, indicating it is full. the water tank spills over big mike drenching him. he stands there still, angry for a moment, then thinks better of it shaking his head and smiling, takes his pen and checks ok on his wet clipboard for the fun house water tank.}
<L>__{exterior early morning. day first aid shack near funhouse}
<A>__{two guards are looking down at big mike below. one guard begins motioning as if guiding a crane into place. the other guard has his hand poised on a large switch lever. guard one is gesturing more emphatically now, closing his hands to indicate "almost there". he closes his hands, and guard two pulls the lever.}

<P>__{(sardonically)}
<D>__{yeah. this is great. i love this plan. drag me kicking and screaming from my happy home in california to some weird place in colorado, and say hey, this'll be fun robbie. maybe we can go camping....}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{look, i know you're not happy about this. but it wasn't my idea for your father to have some kind of mid life crisis and disappear with his secretary to mexico with our life savings.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{"administrative assistant." there's no such thing as a secretary anymore.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{fine. administrative assistant. we couldn't afford to sit around waiting any longer to see if he was coming back. i was able to land a good job here. and now thanks to uncle bernie you have this job at the water park...}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{grounds crew. what kind of job is that? it sound like the guy who cleans out the coffee pots.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{bernie says you help keep the park clean, sweep up, that sort of thing. i'm sure it won't be so bad. besides, a lot of the kids who work at this park go to the same high school you'll be going to. you can start the school year with some ready made friends.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i had friends in oceanside. i had something to do for the summer.}
<A>__{they pass the main water world sign. hanging below it is a banner that says opening tomorrow!.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{hanging out at the beach surfing with your friends is not my idea of something to do. this way you'll make some money and meet people here. you'd best get used to it. this is where we live now. we're staying.}

<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{i can swim. why?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{well, you look old enough to be a guard.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{almost 16. i get my license in september.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's just that most of the guys on grounds are a little younger than you. most guys your age that can swim are guards.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{well, i just moved here. i guess i missed guard tryouts. you're a guard then?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{oh, no no no. i work concessions...at aokee's surf and snack shack. it's just as well. the guards are mostly stuck up anyway. the rest of us are the ones who know how to have fun.}

<C>__{robbie}

<L>__{exterior morning moments later outside uniform building}
<A>__{robbie and alex walk up to yet another line of about 4 or 5 teens. at the front a teenage girl and a teenage guy are behind a counter and handing out uniforms based on a clipboard list. as robbie and alex reach the back of the line, tiffany, a blond beauty and two other girls brush past them to the front of the line.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(taken aback, breathing in through his nose)}
<D>__{whoa....who was that?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(unimpressed, putting his hand}

<D>__{or mine.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{so who is she?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{miss tiffany maxwell, daughter of big mike maxwell, owner and operator of this here fine water park.}
<A>__{we see tiffany and her two friends are quickly given their uniforms by the attendants, as they ignore the kids who have waited in line.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{see, princess tiffany and her friends pretty much have the run of the park. her boyfriend is dan peterson, a guy we all call cowboy, one of the lifeguards. pretty decent guy from what i can tell. but she's a piece of work. your best strategy is to steer clear of her and she won't cause you any trouble.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{cowboy, huh. big guy?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{big. guy.}

<C>__{alex}
<D>__{let's just say....you are critical and indispensable to the ongoing operation... and....flow of things here at the park.}

<D>__{here you go, tiger. one grounds. medium. you have a pair of green shorts at home?}
<A>__{robbie shakes his head "no".}
<C>__{female uniform person }

<A>__{aokee's is a restaurant near thunder bay. it seats about 50 and is lavishly decorated in a hawaiian surf and ocean motif, with surf memorabilia, fish nets, surfboards, and the like. aokee is a large 375 pound plus apparently hawaiian man, late twenties, early thirties, wearing a purple hawaiian shirt, blue shorts and a white chef's apron that says kiss the cook. we see him on a pay phone behind the counter.}
<C>__{aokee}
<P>__{(to person on the line)}
<D>__{david...how you do this to me? i have full staff with you. i save your spot. i was counting on you.}

<A>__{aokee hangs up the phone.}

<D>__{good guy?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{seemed like our kind of people.}
<A>__{aokee thinks for a moment. he glances up towards surf's up. it hits both he and alex at the same time...}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{we need to get him before he get his plunger!}
<A>__{they take off running.}
<L>__{exterior morning moments later trail from aokee's to surf's10}
<B>__{up}
<A>__{aokee and alex are running together. they get about 50 feet before aokee, large man that he is, runs out of breath. alex, like a boxer in training, sort of runs in place, keeping loose, ready for aokee to catch his wind. off they go again, get another 50 feet, and the same thing happens.}
<C>__{aokee}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{alex......}
<P>__{(wheeze)}
<D>__{..you got to go ahead...}
<P>__{(wheeze)}
<D>__{...stall 'til i get there.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(nodding, running in place)}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{alex takes off, and aokee runs again....}
<L>__{exterior morning moments later surf's up wave pool south}
<A>__{we see several rolling trash cans lined up in a row, along with several janitorial carts filled with cleaning utensils and supplies. the colonel is standing, dressed in army fatigue pants and a water world golf shirt, with a green water world baseball cap. he is wearing black horn rim glasses, thick lenses, and carrying a clipboard. lined up as if an army unit are ten grounds kids, including robbie, who is sixth furthest from the colonel. they are all younger than robbie except one, eddie, whom we met at the beginning of the film. eddie is standing tall and straight, proud to be there. he is nearest the colonel}
<C>__{the colonel}
<P>__{(looking up from clipboard)}
<D>__{well, it looks like we have a good staff here. yes...yes a good staff. it will be an excellent summer. remember as we go through training today, our park is judged by the work we do. if we do it well, the people come back.}
<P>__{(walking up and down the line)}
<D>__{we have a little tradition here on the grounds crew. rather than having to learn a lot of names, many of which i can never hope to pronounce properly, each grounds crew member gets a grounds crew nickname. you will be known by that nickname in every way except, of course, your paycheck and employee records.}
<A>__{the colonel looks over his paperwork.}
<C>__{the colonel }
<D>__{let's see, what do we have? hmm...yes. ok, first up is eddie cochran. your grounds crew nickname will be.....eddie!}
<A>__{eddie smiles knowingly. this has been his grounds crew nickname for the last 8 years, mostly because he would never answer to anything else, and the colonel gave up trying.}
<C>__{the colonel }
<D>__{now crewmembers, listen up. eddie here has eight years experience on the grounds crew. why, i'd like to think there isn't anything, any situation that eddie hasn't faced. listen to him. learn from him. watch what he does. this man is the finest, most conscientious grounds crewman we've ever had.}
<A>__{eddie is beaming with pride now. the colonel pulls a brand new toilet plunger from the cart nearby and hands it to eddie. eddie shoulders it as if it were a rifle. the colonel walks down the line.}
<C>__{the colonel }
<D>__{let's see...clark? hmmm. your grounds crew nickname will be....sparky.}
<A>__{it is all robbie can do not to laugh. the colonel goes on to the next kid, skeeter who is tall, skinny and goofy looking. skeeter's eyes are faced forward, but something catches them. his eyes follow an unseen object as we begin to hear a small mosquito. finally his eyes follow it until he looks, cross eyed at his own nose. the colonel has taken note of this and is following it too. skeeter can take no more, and brushes it off his nose as he makes a face.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{sorry, sir. mosquito.}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{hmmm.....your grounds crew nickname will be.....skeeter.}
<A>__{the colonel steps over the cart and gets another new plunger and hands it to skeeter who follows eddie's lead. next in line is a short, chubby lad, snitch. as the colonel approaches him, a quick sound of passing gas is heard. the colonel is startled, and snitch makes a quick finger motion indicating the culprit is skeeter, next to him.}
<C>__{the colonel }
<P>__{(looking at the clipboard)}
<D>__{bradley, is it? ok, mr. bradley.....your grounds crew nickname will be snitch.}
<A>__{snitch shows his dismay with a frown. the colonel has run out of new plungers already and is forced to move to one of last year's leftovers, which look somewhat depressing. he gets one and give it to snitch, who looks at it, makes a face, and decides not to shoulder it. robbie is so depressed he looks like he's about to pass out. his worst fears have been realized. his summer is passing before his eyes. there's only one more person, a young 14 year old girl, to go before robbie. the colonel addresses her.}
<C>__{the colonel }
<D>__{melinda tally. hmmm... your grounds crew nickname will be...}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<A>__{suddenly alex bursts onto the scene, and even he, at this point, is somewhat out of breath.}

<C>__{the colonel}
<P>__{(thinking, staring)}
<D>__{alex, isn't it?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yes sir, colonel. and what a fine staff you've assembled this year. have you told them yet about your army background?}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{well, no, i didn't think it was..}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(interrupting, to the grounds kids)}
<D>__{the colonel here is very modest. did you know that he reorganized the entire process of cleaning and sanitizing an army barracks and its latrines?}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{well, it really wasn't much of a...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(interrupting again)}
<D>__{wasn't much?}
<P>__{(again, to grounds kids)}
<D>__{can you just imagine for a moment the germs and bacteria our american soldiers could pick up in an unsanitised army latrine? it's impossible to determine just how many lives have been saved thanks to the efforts of this one humble army colonel.}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{well, i suppose when you put it that way...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to the grounds kids)}
<D>__{i, too, came up through the ranks when at age 14, i began my service here at water world learning from this great man.}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{yes....i remember now.....what was your grounds nickname...?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{not even sure i remember it myself, sir. but i remember much more. did you tell them about the film?}
<C>__{the colonel}
<D>__{film?}

<A>__{we look back at the wave babe, but the water is obscuring our view. we then see a medium shot of skeeter and snitch. the wave babe walks past them carrying a board, but we don't see below her waist, the board obscures our view. snitch sees, and freezes, dumbstruck. skeeter is looking down at the grate where the wave water drains. he reaches down and pulls something out, and turns to the wave babe walking away.}

<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{but...don't we get an employee discount? shouldn't we go in the front?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{well...the discount is larger this way.}
<A>__{robbie is getting out money from his pocket, counting through it. dave shows up with two burgers and two malts, and hands them to alex, disappears and shuts the door quickly. robbie is still staring at his money.}

<A>__{they walk out of frame.}
<L>__{int day aokee's surf and snack shack}
<A>__{alex and robbie are cleaning tables after another busy lunch. we see that aokee is filling up a bucket, and getting a scrub brush, and heads out the doorway.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{oh boy. here we go.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{what now?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{aokee. the pigeons have been taking target practice on his trophy pedestal. come on.}

<D>__{what is this thing for anyway?}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{someday, robbie. someday.}
<A>__{he keeps cleaning.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to robbie)}
<D>__{that stand is to display the coveted surfer king trophy. aokee seems to think that one day some concessions kid with more courage than brains is going to beat the lifeguards in the annual employee olympics.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{and what would this concessions kid have to do?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{nothing, really. just out surf the strongest guard of them all in the surfing competition. no big deal.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{has it ever happened?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{a guard always wins the surf competition. know why?}
<C>__{together}
<P>__{(robbie and alex)}
<D>__{because concessions kids can't swim!}

<C>__{katie}
<D>__{yeah. two blue crushes please.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{coming up.}
<A>__{he shakes a mix container, blends it for about 5 seconds and pours it out into two cups. he then puts in two umbrellas with pineapple.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{oooh. umbrellas. i've never gotten umbrellas before.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{these are only for vip guests.}
<A>__{amy looks over to katie and rolls her eyes. alex arrives at this point, and decides to provide a distraction.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{amy. have you ever seen the fabulous cummings and robbins 2000 b?}
<C>__{amy}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{as he leads her back into the kitchen...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's incredible. it washes 2000 plates an hour....}
<C>__{katie}
<P>__{(to robbie)}
<D>__{so... you're not from around here, huh?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{california. i just moved here at the beginning of the summer.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i will bet california's nice. i've never been west of the mountains.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{you'd love the ocean. and the sunsets are incredible. you can almost hear the sizzle as the sun drops into the ocean...}
<P>__{(daydreaming a bit)}
<D>__{of course, we all know it doesn't drop into the ocean.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm surprised you're not a guard, coming from the ocean and all.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{let's just say i missed my chance, and alex saved me from a death worse than fate. i was very nearly a trash rat.}
<C>__{katie}
<P>__{(frowns)}
<D>__{oh. good save.}
<A>__{alex has distracted amy all he could and they return from the kitchen.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{well. that was exciting. maybe next time you can show me how to scrub the grill. come on, katie.}
<A>__{they leave.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to robbie, interested)}
<D>__{well...how'd you do?}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{mmmm. i told her how beautiful the california sunsets are.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{good job. you work fast. hey it's time for our break. bring your swimsuit?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{yeah. the wave?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{the wave. i love that water.}
<A>__{robbie looks confused.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{can't swim. it's only three inches deep.}

<P>__{(grabbing his suit and a towel)}
<D>__{ah ha! let's go.}
<L>__{ext moments later the wave area}
<A>__{robbie and alex have their swimsuits on, and are in line to get on the wave. alex is coaching robbie.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{now, just take it easy, and don't expect too much at first. when you wipe out, your ride is done.}
<A>__{alex is up now, and he grabs the board and jumps in. he is pretty good, but not nearly as good as the wave bums. he does a few tricks and wipes out. he gets up and walks up to the line to watch robbie.}
<C>__{alex }
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{just ease into it.}
<A>__{robbie takes the board and looks around. he jumps full force onto the wave. it takes him just a moment to get the feel of the board, and then he is all over it, making the wave bums look like rookies. spins, rolls, everything that can be done he does. finally, the guard blows a whistle indicating that his time is up.}
<C>__{alex }
<P>__{(meeting him at the exit)}
<D>__{gees. where did you learn to do that?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i'm from oceanside, california. i was born on a surfboard.}
<A>__{they start walking back. they stop for a moment to look at thunder bay. just then a wave spews out, and kids on tubes are screaming as they always do.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{think you could ride that?}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(looking right into alex's eyes)}
<D>__{in my sleep.}
<A>__{alex just smiles.}
<L>__{int later that day aokee's surf & snack shack}

<D>__{what you so happy about?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{you're not gonna believe it...}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{listen. some guy came in today and try to buy a sandwich and pay with a phone card. today i believe anything.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i took robbie to the wave today.}
<C>__{aokee}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{what? he drown?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{no. it turns out that he's from oceanside. california. you know, where they always hold those surf competitions?}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{yeah. so?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it turns out that he placed second in the state high school finals for the shortboard competition. as a sophomore.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{robbie.}
<P>__{(laughing in disbelief, dismissive, then serious)}
<D>__{robbie barely walk without help.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i saw it myself. you wouldn't believe it.}
<A>__{we hear a loud crash from the kitchen. aokee winces and gestures toward the kitchen.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{i don' believe it. our robbie?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{our robbie.}
<C>__{aokee}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{if this true....this could be da year.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{that's what i was thinking.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{well, go get him. we need to make ready. he not just walk in and win this thing.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you heard it. he's in the kitchen...}
<A>__{alex goes into the back. aokee sits at a table. robbie comes out of the kitchen wearing a dishwasher apron.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{robbie, sit down. alex, make up a volcano. this boy in training.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(sitting down, worried)}
<D>__{what did i spill now?}
<A>__{we hear the whine of a blender as alex is working on the volcano smoothie.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{robbie, alex tell me you are some kind of surfer. this true?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i dunno. yeah, surfing is usually how i spend my summers.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{you know about employee olympics?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{yeah. some kind of trophy.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{surfer king trophy. very big. very nice.}
<P>__{(looking down)}
<D>__{concessions never win.}
<A>__{alex arrives with the volcano smoothie. he turns a chair around and sits. they will gang up on him.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i dunno...seems kind of silly to me.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's a big deal. every girl wants to date you. every guy wants to be you. special privileges...we all wear standard uniforms. the surfer king gets to be creative. you ever see the cowboy hat cowboy wears?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{it shouldn't be that hard...how good could this cowboy be?}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{he very good. his family go to hawaii every year, two, three weeks. good surfer. if you do this, you need to see pipeman.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{pipeman?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{he's a myth.}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{oh, no. pipeman very real. works here in park. low profile. you must find him and convince him to teach you the secrets of the thunder bay wave. this not the ocean, surf boy.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{pipeman. the banzai pipeline. i get it. some kind of legendary surf champ. where do we find him?}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{i only see him once, maybe twice. stay behind scenes. but here he is and find him you must.}
<P>__{(to robbie)}
<D>__{so. you do this?}
<A>__{robbie looks at them, thinking for a moment.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{int moments later aokee's surf & snack shack}
<A>__{we see quarters going ding ding ding into the pay phone on aokee's wall. the shot widens to reveal aokee is dumping quarters and robbie is holding the phone. he puts it up to his ear.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hello, grandma? no, i'm fine. listen, grandma...i need you to send me a few of my things...}
<A>__{aokee and alex are huddled around smiling.}
<L>__{int day big mike's office}
<A>__{big mike is standing, walking around as he speaks, tiffany is sitting. clearly she is being scolded.}
<C>__{big mike}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{....why you wouldn't believe the things i've heard. just stupid things. cutting in line. demanding special treatment. oh, and how about this one:}
<P>__{(mimicking her)}
<D>__{princesses don't carry trash.}
<P>__{(back to his voice)}
<D>__{i've often thought it was a mistake to have you work here. maybe i was right.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(trying to dance out of it)}
<D>__{oh, daddy. you know how jealous people get.}
<C>__{big mike}
<D>__{i'd almost believe that. but i was behind the first aid station when you said the "princess" line. this park exists because the kids here work hard. they need to be treated fairly. they need to see you are just another lifeguard.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(protesting)}
<D>__{but i'm not just another lifeguard.}
<C>__{big mike}
<P>__{(mad again)}
<D>__{you won't even be that if this continues. if you want to keep coming here every day and driving that little convertible of yours, i need to see real, concrete changes in your attitude.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{all right. what do you expect me to do?}
<C>__{big mike}
<D>__{for one thing, start mingling with "the commoners". you'd be amazed at how nice some of the people who work here are. make some friends outside that little group of yours. it's the work of the average teenager here that puts food on our table. show some gratitude.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(thinking a moment)}
<D>__{fine. i will work it.}
<C>__{big mike}
<P>__{(softening, but firm)}
<D>__{good. work on it. please?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(nodding, but we don't believe her)}
<D>__{oh, daddy. don't worry about a thing.}
<L>__{ext morning the next day time shack}
<A>__{robbie and alex hook up and grab their time cards. there is a banner hanging that says, "employee luau tonight", and skeeter and snitch have taken a 5 gallon bucket and are using it as a stepladder to attach something. skeeter is on the bucket with a stapler in his hand. snitch hands up the hand lettered magic marker addition, which skeeter staples on to the bottom of the banner while snitch keeps a lookout. the addition says, "come get lei'd". they scamper off, laughing.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(looking up at the sign)}
<D>__{this will be good. aokee throws a great luau.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i don't how much fun it will be. with aokee hosting, we'll be working.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{there'll still be time for fun. most of the work is setting up. besides, we get paid, too. when was the last time you got paid to party?}
<A>__{with that, alex punches in, as if to punctuate the line.}
<L>__{ext night outside aokee's surf & snack shack}
<A>__{it is dark, but the place is lit up by little lights everywhere, christmas lights in the fake palm trees, tiki lights around aokee's, and lights lighting a stage where a band is playing, what else, surf music. buffet tables line the area, and there is smoothie bar set up. big mike himself is behind the bar making smoothies, while richard is playing bass in the band. aokee is running around making sure all the buffet items are full. everyone is wearing leis, but the cheap plastic ones, except aokee and his staff, who have real ones flown in from hawaii.}
<C>__{aokee}
<P>__{(pouring out four smoothies to robbie and alex)}
<D>__{ok. you work hard, and we fine now. your time to party. here they are. special love smoothies. be careful!}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to robbie)}
<D>__{these never fail.}
<A>__{alex picks up two leis from a box behind the counter. he and robbie walk over to amy and katie who are standing over near the buffet.}
<C>__{alex }
<P>__{(to robbie, but if front of amy and katie)}
<D>__{now this will never do.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(agreeing)}
<D>__{i'm afraid you're right. something must be done.}
<A>__{alex and robbie set the smoothies on a nearby table. they remove the cheap plastic leis the girls are wearing. then they put on the real ones they carried over. alex steps back to admire his work.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{oh, yes, yes....}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{perfect. a work of art.}
<A>__{the girls look at each other and smile. alex and robbie grab the smoothies and hand two to the girls. amy sips hers right away.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i don't remember anything like this on aokee's menu.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{they're..}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{..special smoothies. fortunately, you know people on the inside.}
<A>__{onstage, the band had finished a tune before the dialog began above. now jaffa steps up to the mike.}
<C>__{jaffa}
<D>__{we'd like thank aokee and his crew for hosting this evening's luau.}
<A>__{everyone applauds, aokee waves. alex raises a hand and waves off the accolade. robbie nods and smiles as the amy and katie clap as well.}
<C>__{jaffa }
<D>__{we'd also like to bring aokee up to sing one of his hawaiian specialties.}
<A>__{again, everyone claps and cheers him on. aokee goes on stage.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you girls want to dance?}
<C>__{katie}
<P>__{(grabbing robbie's hand and}
<D>__{leading out to the dance}

<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{amy shrugs yes and goes out with alex.}
<C>__{aokee}
<P>__{(onstage)}
<D>__{mahalo and aloha. this song is sung on my island for all young people in love...or about to be. is called e o'mai, or, you are mine.}
<A>__{aokee begins singing the hawaiian love song, "e o'mai". many couples are dancing; it is a slow song. alex, of course, is a goof. he dances slow, but every once in a while executes a deep dip, much to amy's terror. eddie is off to the edge of the dance floor, watching, longingly, and kind of swaying to the music. a couple of girls walk by and he does a magic trick for them. he holds both hands up, palms open to show he has nothing in his hands. he also gestures that he has no sleeves (he is wearing a tuxedo t shirt). he reaches behind his back and pulls out a trick bouquet of flowers, but they don't quite open right, and are still unfolding as he holds them. eddie smiles weakly, he knows that isn't quite how it was supposed to go. the girls appear encouraging, but as they leave look at each other and giggle. we pick up robbie and katie dancing.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{so. how are things working out at aokee's?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{oh, he's great. alex too. i thought this summer was going to be a train wreck, but it's not turning out too bad.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{well, of course this isn't california...}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{no, but it looks like i will get a chance to do some surfing anyway.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{apparently there's some kind of surfing contest and aokee is all over me to enter.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{you mean the surfer king?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{you've heard of it?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{it's all the other girls seem to talk about. this is my first year, but apparently it's a pretty big deal. being from oceanside, you should have a good chance.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{we'll see. it seems kind of stupid to me. a surfing contest in colorado.}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{my friends back home would never believe it.}
<A>__{they continue to dance. we see big mike talking to tiffany and gesturing broadly. tiffany is clearly not agreeing with what he is saying. cowboy is nowhere to be seen. suddenly she throws up her hands and marches over to the dance floor where eddie is standing alone, swaying a bit to the music. she whispers something in his ear, and eddie's eyes get real big as she leads him by the hand to the middle of the dance floor. she wraps her arms around eddie and they dance, all the while glaring at her father. eddie knows a good thing when he sees it, and quickly settles in, big man on campus. tiffany is taller than he is, so he happily puts his head on her shoulder. big mike looks back at them, not happy with the way it happened, but satisfied. doug fitzgerald (twenty bucks doug) is dancing with a girl when alex, doing some kind of fancy spin to amy, bumps into him.}
<C>__{doug}
<P>__{(to alex)}
<D>__{alex. got my twenty bucks?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{oh, dougie. you know, i left my wallet over in my locker. i will see you before we leave and get it to you then.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yeah, sure.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you know, you could always come by aokee's and i could give it to you in trade.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{cash money, alex. cash money.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{no problem.}
<A>__{alex grabs amy and swings her into another fancy move that leads them away from doug. the song ends, and everybody claps. aokee bows.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(to katie)}
<D>__{hey, listen. alex told me about this great spot on the other side of thunder bay that looks down on the party, but it's a little more quiet. want to go for a walk?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{they pick up their smoothies and walk off into the night.}

<C>__{katie}
<D>__{so...what made your folks pick up from beautiful southern california and move to colorado?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{not both my folks. just my mom.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{aha...trouble in paradise?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{let's just say my father had an eye for his administrative assistant, and now they're both somewhere in mexico. mom got a job here, some of her family's here, so they said "colorady is the place you outta be".}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{it could be worse.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{well, i must admit, i've met some very nice people.}
<P>__{(looking down and smiling)}
<D>__{in california, the attitude's a little different. here, not everyone is out to prove something. seem's like everyone just wants to have fun.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i have a theory. sometimes it snows here so hard, that it's a challenge just to get to work or to school. everything shuts down for a day or so. if your car gets stuck, people appear from nowhere to help pull you out and get you back on the road. most people here don't just look out for themselves. a lot of times, they're looking out for you, too.}
<L>__{exterior moments later night customer service kiosk}
<A>__{alex and amy are inside the kiosk. alex is showing her how everything works.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{all these switches feed sound throughout the park. which reminds me.}
<A>__{he pulls out a cd and pops it into the cd player and presses play. he sees a flyswatter and begins waving it around like a sword.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{and this is for bad little girls who don't know how to have fun.}
<A>__{he begins swishing it around, amy is giggling.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{oops. there....almost got you.}
<A>__{amy is dodging and laughing. alex closes in and seems like he will kiss her, but just starts gumming her neck, tickling her. amy leans back laughing and we see her back hits the volume knob on the amplifier.}
<L>__{exterior night moments later grand pavilion}
<A>__{they have reached the area to the west of thunder bay. it is simply a concrete pad that overlooks the party below. we hear "paradise is in your eyes" by michael peace, which begins with a lot of jungle sound effects.}

<P>__{(looking down at the party)}
<D>__{you were right. this is nice.}
<P>__{(reacting to the jungle noises)}
<D>__{but not necessarily quieter.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{just a sec.}

<C>__{alex }
<P>__{(into the radio)}
<D>__{i'm on it.}
<A>__{he turns down the volume back to normal. he also flips a switch. they hear the tune now, and amy jumps off the counter, stands there and smiles. alex does an over the top mambo moving to her and they start to slow dance.}
<L>__{exterior night grand pavilion}
<A>__{robbie has set down the radio, and is walking back to katie now, who is swaying to the music. he doesn't get too close to her, and actually stands off to her left. since she has the room and is momentarily inspired, she begins a few dance moves, ballet, and then ballroom style. robbie has seen this sort of thing before, and instinctively, almost without thinking steps in and becomes her dance partner. they proceed in a beautiful dance that almost seems rehearsed. finally it occurs to them both.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(quizzically)}

<A>__{we see that the lounge chairs have been removed and the area is clear. there are scattered squashed up pieces of white paper lying about. we look to the south and see that there are three boy girl teams with one of their legs tied together, like a three legged race. the rub here is one team member has the dustpan and the other team member has the broom. a judge triggers a starter pistol and they are off. the lifeguard team falls almost immediately, and the grounds team takes a early lead over the concessions team, who are trying to figure the dustpan broom operation out. the two grounds people work tightly together and quickly advance. the lifeguards have gotten back up and are hobbling up to their first piece of trash. concessions has figured out the dustpan, but are still well behind the grounds kids. finally, the grounds kids win, with concessions up second, and lifeguards trailing in third. the judges note the finish on their clipboards.}

<A>__{we see three male participants standing in the shallow end of thunder bay, one red suit (lifeguard) one blue suit (concessions) and one green suit (grounds) a judge on the rise to the west of thunder bay blows an air horn to start the race. they all rush into the bay and begin swimming furiously. the guard takes the lead quickly, followed not far behind by the grounds kid. the concessions kid is working hard and splashing a lot but not getting very far. as the guard reaches the back wall, he does an underwater racing turn and swims back toward the point where they started. right behind him, the smaller grounds kid does the same thing. as they are returning, they pass the concessions kid, who still is splashing a lot but not going fast. after they pass him he stops, as he is tired out. momentarily he can't even tread water any more, and a guard watching from the sidelines jumps in and pulls him out. the swimming guard has beaten the grounds kid, the concessions kid never finishes.}

<A>__{there are three lines set up with several participants. it is a relay race, with the baton replaced by a tray full of drinks in paper cups, water. the colors indicate again concessions, guards and grounds. the race is already in full swing, with concessions in the lead. the last group of relayers are now getting their trays, and concessions is way ahead. everyone is cheering their team on. the final pass is made to sarah who works for aokee's. she takes the tray and moves gracefully to the final stop. there is a small table on which the drinks must be placed. she is clearly going to win when she suddenly stops. all concessions kids are shocked and plead her to go on. she does a nifty and graceful around the back maneuver with the tray, proceeds to the table, and sets down the drinks, tipping the tray sideways to show no water has been spilled. the judges scribble furiously.}

<A>__{three picnic tables are set up in front of aokee's. we dolly past each one to see that they are cluttered indentically with what appears to be the leftovers from lunch for four. behind each table is a team of two guards, concessions and grounds kids. a judge blows a whistle and we begin by looking at the lifeguard team. it is a boy and a girl and the girl is not too keen on this. they bring a trash can with them and begin gingerly clearing the table, acting as if they are afraid to get their hands dirty. we dolly left to see the concessions team a little ahead of the guard team. we dolly further left to reveal a grounds kid in a full rain suit with a face shield. a tremendous force of water is clearing the table into the trash can which the rain suited grounds kid is holding at it's end. we dolly further left to see eddie in full army fatigues with safety goggles on and wearing the biggest super soaker water gun in the history of man. the table is quickly cleared, and at the same time washed. eddie holds up the business end of the super soaker gun and blows imaginary smoke from it's barrel, like an old western gunfighter. the judges take notes.}

<A>__{the three different teams are gathered in groups waiting for the next challenge. one of each team is in full sweats, color coordinated by team. alex is the one in the sweats for concessions. slowly the sweats people walk into the pool about waist deep and lay down. the grounds kid is the littlest guy of all. a judge blows a whistle and four members of each team run into the water and drag their now soaked sweat suited teammate out of the water. they lie them down on a clear area and begin cpr. the guards have a nifty little plastic device that lets them blow air into the mouth of their victim, and they roll him quickly on his side to clear water and back to begin cpr. they are fast and efficient, and clearly expertly trained. we move left to see the grounds kids, knowledgeable but inexperienced. one girl is using her hands to provide a seals over the mouth of her "victim" and another is clumsily pumping his chest while the others try to keep a count while reading some kind of instruction card.. we move again to see the concessions kids, who are in trouble. alex is lying there dying, and they are arguing about who has to breathe into his mouth. they form a circle over him, pointing and arguing. finally they all just walk off and alex is still lying on the ground, eyes rolled back and twitching convulsively in a hilarious death scene. the judges take their notes.}

<A>__{once again three teams representing the three competing factions. large stainless steel pots are bubbling on three propane cooking stands in front of the concession. the teams each have three members in cooking aprons, again, color coded. one from each team is stirring the team's chili while the others watch the judges anxiously. lines are forming in front of each pot, with people in line each carrying a paper chili bowl, but holding back, deferring to the judges. the judges are each carrying three styro cups in which to receive the chili. they each get a portion from the guard team and take a sip. they smile politely to the cooks, but turn around and spit the chili back into the cup as delicately as possible, almost as if throwing up. a concessions kid is there with a tray of waters, which they quickly take advantage of. they move on to the grounds team. they get their portions and taste the chili and nod, not bad. they take another sip of water to clear their palate and move on to the concessions team. the portions are proudly scooped. they take a taste, smile and take some more. they huddle for a moment and then place a blue ribbon on the concessions pot. the lines quickly rearrange and merge themselves so that everyone is in line for the concessions pot.}

<D>__{that's a bad idea...}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{and you're such a good guard...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you'd be miserable...}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{maybe you're right. see you around...}
<A>__{eddie appears out of the time shack wearing his tuxedo t shirt.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(almost singing)}
<D>__{tiffany!}
<A>__{he walks up to her driver's side.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(feeling charitable, warmly)}
<D>__{hello, eddie.}
<A>__{eddie shows there is nothing in his hands, then reaches into the car and from behind tiffany's ear pulls a plastic easter egg out. he hands it to her, and she opens it. a beautiful butterfly flies out and away. she is momentarily entranced.}
<C>__{tiffany }
<D>__{you know, that's one of the most beautiful things i've ever seen.}
<P>__{(pause, thinking, what the heck)}
<D>__{hop in eddie, let me give you a ride home.}
<A>__{eddie waves his hand for her to scoot over so he can drive. she is surprised, but does, almost reflexively. he gets in and he looks at alex, robbie, katie and amy grinning broadly as he pulls away. alex, robbie, katie and amy just watch in stunned silence as eddie and tiffany drive off.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(collecting himself)}
<D>__{well. just another summer at water world.}
<A>__{the group begins walking toward the exit gate, as we go wide and helicopter upward. they get smaller and smaller in the shot as we hear the conversation continue.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{you know katie, i really am sorry i was such a jerk this summer.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{we'll be going to the same high school. you'll have plenty of chances to make it up to me. let's see, there's homecoming, the christmas dance, valentines day...and of course, the prom...}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{alex?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i'm gonna need to borrow twenty bucks.}
<C>__{alex}

<A>__{we helicopter up for a final shot over the whole park.}
<C>__{the end}
