<A>__{an old fashioned calendar, the kind that used to hang in offices in the forties. each day is a tear off page. the dates are printed in bold black lettering. the pages of days of the year zip off at a rate faster than the eye can really register. the impression should be of time whizzing by... over this, santa claus narrates....}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{'twas a long time ago, quite a bit to be fair in a place that i'm sure you are quite unaware. for our story that you are about to be told began in the holiday worlds of old. without holidays, goodness, how dull life would be without their distraction and pleasure and glee.}
<A>__{the calendar makes a sudden stop at}
<B>__{christmas.}
<A>__{the calendar page peels back to reveal the first hint of color in the black and white of the year. smoke curls up from the chimney of a snow covered cottage in a clearing of a snow covered pine forest. the stop is only for a beat. then the calendar speeds on.}
<D>__{santa (v.o.) (cont'd) but our holidays are the result of much fuss and hard work for the worlds that must make them for us}
<A>__{the calendar stops again. this time at valentine's day. this stop is short, but longer than the last as each subsequent stop will be. in valentine ville, fat cupids shoot arrows at distant chocolate dripping hearts: target practice.}
<D>__{santa (v.o.) (cont'd) see, each holiday town works all year to create twenty four special hours, fantastically great.}
<A>__{soon the calendar whirls on. next stop is}
<B>__{easter}
<A>__{where it is spring. cackling hens sit side by side on their long row of nests. in unison, choreographed like some ballet, they lay their pre decorated eggs. the eggs then drop down a chute and land on a conveyor belt which carries them out ot the henhouse and into waiting easter baskets.}
<D>__{santa (v.o.) (cont'd) fleeting twenty four hours take long to prepare, a full year of planning and plenty of care. but now getting back to the story at hand i should mention this point about holiday lands }
<A>__{the calendar flips to the}
<B>__{fourth of july. fireworks.}
<A>__{ abe lincoln fires a cannon. the cannonball explodes mid air, showering down the word, "happy." betsy ross uses a sparkler to write the word, "fourth." paul revere sets off the first of six rockets. rocket #1 erupts into an "o." #2 traces an "f" together they read "of." rocket #3 won't light. neither will #4, #5, or #6. paul revere panicks. but paul revere's horse saves the day. he kicks off his horseshoes shooting them at the side of a wooden fence. as they hit the boards each becomes a letter: "j," "u," "l," "y."}
<D>__{santa (v.o.) (cont'd) for each one, way back when, was alas unaware of the others' existence, now i've said it so there!}
<A>__{the calendar pages tear on, slowing at october 29, slowing more at, and stopping at the 31st.}
<D>__{santa (v.o.) (cont'd) but once there occurred a calamity so great! when two of the worlds did collide by mistake...}
<A>__{the october 31st page peels back to... nothing. to black. we fall in, or perhaps it should feel more like we're swallowed up.}
<B>__{title sequence.}
<A>__{carved jack o'lanterns come at us in the long tunnel of darkness. collision seems inevitable, but in the instant before we would slam into them, the jack o'lanterns veer off, turning to display the various credits on their uncarved backsides. when the last jack o'lantern zooms toward us, it doesn't veer off. it keeps coming and fast. rather than collide with it though we fall straight into one of the pumpkinhead's carved out, triangular eyes into the further black there and out...}
