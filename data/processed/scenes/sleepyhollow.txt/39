<A>__{ichabod jerks awake in his bed.}
<L>__{interior van tassel house, kitchen night}
<A>__{ichabod enters with a lantern and his ledger. he sits, studies notes, then notices there's a light down the hall.}
<L>__{interior van tassel house, sewing room night}
<A>__{opposite an elaborate loom, katrina reads by candlelight. she looks up, seeing ichabod enter.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{sorry for disturbing you. i thought a forgotten candle was burning.}
<A>__{katrina self consciously closes her shabby book, puts it with another on her lap and covers them.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{you do not disturb me. please stay. having trouble sleeping?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{may i ask... why do you cover your book that way?}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{you pay great attention to small things. i hide these as i hide all my books. father would not approve, lest it were the bible.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{i, um... i have something to show you, if you have a moment.}
<A>__{ichabod sits, looking through his ledger.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{these are strange... may i?}
<A>__{she takes his hand, spreads the fingers to the palm. she touches the many evenly spaced scars.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{these scars. how did you get them?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{i have had them since childhood. i cannot remember what from.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{it would be interesting to find out.}
<A>__{their eyes meet. ichabod gets back to the ledger. katrina seems to relish the effect she has. ichabod finds a paper disk on string, illustrated thusly:}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{here it is. a bird on one side. his cage on the other. now, stare at it.}
<P>__{(spinning it)}
<D>__{the bird seems to be in his cage.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{yes, he does. may i try?}
<A>__{ichabod gives it. she spins it, smiling.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{he only appears to be inside the cage. the point being...}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{you made this, and the drawings?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{yes, but listen. the illusion is easily explained. the eye retains each image, till they combine. and yet, some would call this toy magic.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{don't you see why? look closely a moment. put your intellect aside.}
<P>__{(spinning it)}
<D>__{can't you see what is inexplicable?}
<A>__{ichabod watches it spin. he shakes his head, unimpressed.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{oh, you are hopeless. may i keep it at least?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{if you want. but...}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{then, i also have a gift for you. true magic which even you will not be able to deny.}
<A>__{she hands him a book. "romeo and juliet." ichabod stands, offering it back, but she will not take it.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{thank you. no. here...}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{i insist that you have it.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<P>__{(resigned, leaving)}
<D>__{very well. but, it will only sit gathering dust.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{that would be a pity. those words might show you something you've never seen before.}
<A>__{ichabod stops at the door, looks back. he exits.}
