<A>__{he stops, realizing the last word of the song. he sits silently, staring at the wall. suddenly, there is a sound at the door. sam's eyes shoot up. the door begins to open. sam stands up. his face begins to tighten. we know instantly that something is wrong. his eyes fill with a fury we have not seen before. the mugger, the man who killed sam, is entering the loft. he has a key in his hand and puts it in his pocket. sam is stunned. the mugger locks the door.}

<A>__{sam goes wild. he shoots at the man with all his might, attacking him unceasingly, but with no effect. his hands and feet pass right through him.}

<A>__{suddenly we hear a key turning in the front door. the mugger seems startled. he dashes from the bedroom and hides quickly behind one of the large sculptures. we hear the door open. molly is standing there. sam goes crazy.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{molly, no! get out!}
<A>__{molly closes the door and locks it shut. sam freezes as she heads for the bedroom. she walks right past the mugger. to sam's horror she stops and turns to look around. there is a curious expression on her face. seeing nothing she continues through the loft. the mugger pulls out his gun. sam looks on in absolute terror. molly's purple blouse hits the floor as she begins to remove her clothes. she turns on the radio. sam doesn't know what to do. the mugger seems excited by molly's semi nudity. he begins skirting the edges of the loft, moving toward the bedroom. sam is crazed. suddenly, out of nowhere, frank appears at the mugger's feet. sam's eyes light up. he drops to his knees, crawls over to him, glares into his eyes, and screams. angle the cat screeches and jumps straight up. his claws shoot out at the mugger's face, ripping into the flesh near his eye. blood appears. the mugger sees it dripping through his fingers. the sight of it upsets him. he grabs the cat angrily by the neck. it squeals. molly in her bra, peers from the bedroom.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{frank, what's wrong?}
<A>__{the mugger holds the cat's mouth shut. seeing and hearing nothing, molly steps back into the bedroom. the mugger takes the cat and throws it across the floor. holding his eye, he gets up and rushes for the exit. sam runs after him, but the door closes before he can get through. he is left inside. angle sam stares at the closed door in a wild panic. he doesn't know what to do. then, summoning all of his courage, he takes a blind, running slow motion leap and charges through it. sam's p.o.v. there is a brief sense of passing through a molecular force field, a miniature universe inside the door. angle sam as he emerges from the door and lands on the other side. he seems excited to have survived and is very pleased with himself.}
