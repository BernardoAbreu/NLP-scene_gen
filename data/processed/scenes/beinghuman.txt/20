<A>__{hector wraps the towel around his master and follows him, a look of concern on his face. lucinnius' worries are hector's also. hector walks a pace behind lucinnius through various chambers of the bathhouse, passing the games area and the massage room as they go. all around them slaves attend to their pampered masters.}
<L>__{interior bathhouse cool room day}
<A>__{after an anxious scan of the cool room, lucinnius goes towards three men occupying a marble bench. hector as if by magic produces a small wooden stool for his master to sit on as he joins the others. hector then moves out of earshot, but still alert to his master's behavior. lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to casually join his friends. the eldest of the three gives off as much of the aura of a godfather as a naked man in a towel can. the other two are deferential to the older man, and treat lucinnius with apparent con tempt. hector watches the older man put a paternal hand on luccinius's shoulder and speak with a calm smile on his face. hector almost winces to see his master submit to this patronizing treatment. slave and master exist so closely together that many of their feelings are shared. more precisely, lucinnius's feelings are shared by hector. it is a one way exchange. from morning until night, and probably in his dreams too, hector is living two lives, his own and his master's. here in ancient rome is this what they call classic schizophrenia? as luccinius stands to leave we can tell by their expres sions that the three men are open in their contempt for him. hector is quickly on his feet and by lucinnius's side as he goes. a final sarcastic remark comes from one of the three.}
