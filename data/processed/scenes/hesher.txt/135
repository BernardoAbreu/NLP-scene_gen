<D>__{why? what do you want?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i wanted to tell you something.}
<A>__{tj stares at her.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{i didn't know if i should come here or not, but i couldn't stop thinking about it. i thought maybe if i came you'd still just be really angry at me and hate me, but then i thought if i didn't you'd think i didn't care and you'd hate me anyway, so i figured i might as well come, just in case, so here i am.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{yeah, well what do you want?}
<C>__{nicole}

<A>__{tj looks at her, he doesn't really want to be mad at her.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{i understand if you don't want to be my friend. i didn't mean to hurt your feelings. sometimes i just... i don't know. i just wanted to come around and say all that, but maybe you still hate me and so it doesn't matter, but i just came round to say that, but i've said it now, so i should just go. so, ok, bye.}
