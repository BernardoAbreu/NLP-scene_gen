<A>__{hot sunlight. philip stands gazing across the plaza at the great cathedral on the far side, as the bells ring out and the crowd in the plaza below wave their hats and cheer. the infanta is by his side. his ministers cluster behind him. lining the crowd on either side of the plaza stand columns of armed soldiers: a formidable reminder of the king's power. philip does nothing, but his presence intoxicates the crowd. as their cries swell, wave upon wave, the king's eyes glow and he breathes in deeply, feeding on his people's adoration.}
