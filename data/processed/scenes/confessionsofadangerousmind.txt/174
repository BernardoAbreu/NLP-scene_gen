<A>__{barris sits behind his desk, draws a line down a piece of paper and writes "pros" and "cons" at the top of the page. he thinks. under "pros" he writes "become national celebrity", "get more attention from stewardesses", "even more women will want to have sex with me". under "cons" he writes: "easier target for kgb." he gets up, paces. suddenly, a shot rings out. it comes through the window and shatters the mirror. barris dives to the floor. more shots, crazy relentless shooting. barris crawls on his belly to the window, carefully reaches up and lowers the venetian blinds just as another shot whizzes through. the blinds explode. the shooting stops he waits on the floor, shaking like a leaf. he pulls the list off his desk and writes under "pro": "i need another hit before i die."}
