<A>__{rose pulls her shirt off and wraps it around her head so that only her eyes are exposed. she strains to open a window that's been painted shut. she bangs and pulls but it doesn't budge. rose finds a can of beans and whacks them against the base of the window in an attempt to break the seal. rose grows more desperate with each failed effort.}
