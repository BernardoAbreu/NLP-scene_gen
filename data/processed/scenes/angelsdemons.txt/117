<A>__{which is lit only by the wild orange flames. he creeps forward, gun in front of him, toward a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall. he reaches for it but a hand reaches for him from behind, he's pulled off his feet and in the main aisle, olivetti and vincenzo whirl as two gunshots come from the darkened side aisle. they race toward it. at the bonfire, langdon shouts to two more vatican cops, pointing upward.}

<D>__{the cleat, on the wall! get something to stand on!}
<A>__{he's pointing at a cleat, maybe ten feet up on the wall, where the right guide wire is attached. vatican cops 2 & 3 drag a half burned pew out of the fire and pull it underneath, leaning it against the wall for greater height, langdon starts to climb it, to uncleat the wire.}
<B>__{in the darkened left aisle}
<A>__{olivetti creeps forward, gun at the ready, vincenzo close behind him. they see a form on the floor in front of them and olivetti bends down it's the first vatican policeman. dead in a pool of his own blood. vincenzo, standing behind olivetti, looks down, horrified, and in that moment of distraction, a figure creeps up behind him and twists his head 180 degrees with one smooth motion. olivetti whirls, but his gun comes around a split second slower than he does and in that split second a shadow falls over him, something slashes through the air and in the main aisle, langdon struggles to climb the pew that's leaned against the wall as vatican cop 4 finds a long handled candle snuffer and races toward the edge of the fire with it. blinking back the intense heat, he manages to hook the cardinals manacled foot with it, he turns to langdon who, stretched as far as he possibly can, just manages to loose the wire from its cleat, holding tightly to it so as not to let the cardinal go into free fall. but the pew on which he's balanced starts to wobble, then blam! blam! two gunshots thud into the chests of vatican cops 2 & 3, who were supporting the pew. they fall, the pew tips and langdon, falling loses his grip on the chain. the cardinal falls toward the flames. vatican cop 4 tries to pull him to safety, but doesn't have enough of whirrs through the pulley until it reaches its the cardinal to an abrupt stop, six feet lower and directly in the middle of the bonfire. his shriek of agony echoes through the burning church. langdon slams to the floor just at the edge of the burning church pews, maybe cracking a rib on the hard floor of the church. a figure steps out of the shadows, looming over him, langdon looks up, expecting a gunshot, but instead sees the bleeding figure of olivetti, staggering toward him, clutching his slit throat in his last moments of life. nearby, vatican cop 4 is desperately trying to pull the cardinal from the flames, the end of the candle snuffer is now hooked around the cardinal's foot, he pulls him closer, reaches out, can almost grab his ankle until he is shot in the back. he falls to the floor, drawing and dropping his gun in the process, losing his grip on the long handled pole as well. on the ground, bleeding, he sees his gun, just a foot away from his hand. he reaches for it. and a foot steps on his wrist, breaking it. mr. gray stands over him, implacable. from a distance, we see mr. gray fire two shots into the ground where cop 4 is lying. then he turns toward us. nearby, langdon, still on the ground, looks up at the sound of the shots. through the burning church pews he can see mr. gray, starting toward him. langdon crawls, on all fours, through the outskirts of the bonfire, toward a recessed part of the wall ten or fifteen feet away. mr. gray steps up behind him, raises his gun }

<A>__{recognizing the id, the two cops glance away for a second, to search the rest of the church and mr. gray blasts two shots into each of them. they drop, dead, but one of them squeezes off a single round before falling. mr. gray looks down, at his right shoulder, where a dark red stain is spreading on his suit. he touches it, more annoyed than anything. underneath the burning pews, langdon has crawled as close as he dares to the raging fire, and the sleeve of his shirt is ablaze. he rolls out the other side of the embers, stamping out the flames, gets to his feet, and takes off running. mr. gray pursues, only slowing his gait slightly to double tap two shots into the head of a dying vatican cop. across the church, langdon hurls himself over a balustrade and into a chapel on the far side of the church. bullets shatter the glass of an elevated crypt, three feet off the floor. (inside is a superbly detailed wax statue of a saint in death.) langdon dives under it and crawls backwards, staring in horror at mr. gray's feet as they approach the chapel from across the church. langdon's back thuds into a wall. dead end. but there's an old wooden grating in the wall. he turns, kicks it with both feet. the grating crunches into pieces, revealing a narrow crawlspace in the crawl space, langdon army crawls through it. mr. gray's face appears in the entry to the crypt. he pauses to change clips on his handgun the floor beneath langdon abruptly runs out mr. gray raises his gun and langdon disappears. the gunshots thud into cement wall where he was, not where he is. underground, langdon crunches to a hard landing on a subterranean stone floor, rolls over, and sees mr. gray above him, now pointing down. but there's another crawl space, and langdon scurries into it. in the second crawl space, it's hopelessly dark, an even tighter space than the last one, filled with cobwebs that langdon blindly claws his way through. he hits another hole in the floor, falls a second time }
