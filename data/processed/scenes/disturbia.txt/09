<L>__{interior classroom day continuous}
<A>__{on ronnie yun, 16, a scrawny korean kid with a knack for perfect spanish, stands at the front giving his speech. note: every time ronnie says "quizas" ("perhaps") the class giggles because it sounds a lot like "kiss ass." the teacher, senor gutierrez, a rotund 50, bad comb over and khakis up to his naval, stands off to the side, quickly picking up on ronnie's excessive and increasingly dramatic use of the word.}

<D>__{perhaps i won't. perhaps i will just stay at home. but perhaps my parents will take pity on me.}
<P>__{(more dramatic)}
<D>__{perhaps they will make my dream a reality! perhaps they will take me to a beach on the french riviera so that i may gaze upon the natural beauty of its female inhabitants.}

<A>__{senor gutierrez takes some chalk, flicks it at the kid. he still doesn't budge. ronnie nudges him.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{dude }
<A>__{the kid stirs, raises his head. the hoodie falls away to reveal kale. longer, disheveled hair. the spark in his eye's been replaced with an empty haze.}
<C>__{senor gutierrez}
<D>__{so kale, think you can stay conscious long enough to tell us your plans for the three wondrous summer months ahead?}
<A>__{kale glances around. all eyes on him. he looks at ronnie who nods in support. kale gets up, heads to the front of the class. he pauses. trying to focus. then }
