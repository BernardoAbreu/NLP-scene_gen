<A>__{a scratchy zeppelin album, the song all of my love, fills the room. jack, a fifth of bushmills by his side, goes through the box kate gave him. he removes a worn leather jacket, feeling the soft material, then a mondale for president button, which jack smiles upon seeing, a couple neil young concert ticket stubs... he puts the leather jacket on, then sticks the mondale button on the lapel. he digs back into the box, finding... a messy, dog eared copy of cats cradle...not the one kate gave him at the airport, the one she replaced... jack looks at it for a moment...lost in his sadness... then... he looks over at the clock, it reads, 8:29.}
