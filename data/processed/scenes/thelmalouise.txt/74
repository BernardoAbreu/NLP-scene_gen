<L>__{exterior pay phone day}
<A>__{thelma is trying not to cry. she's trying to be strong.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{darryl, please... you're my husband, not my father, darryl.}
<L>__{interior thelma's house day}
<C>__{darryl}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{that does it! that louise is nothin' but a bad influence. if you're not back here tonight, goddamnit, thelma... well, i just don't wanna say...}
<A>__{neither one of them say anything for a moment.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{thelma?}
<L>__{exterior pay phone day}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{darryl.}
<C>__{darryl }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{go fuck yourself.}
<A>__{she hangs up on him.}
<L>__{exterior country store day}
<A>__{thelma has tears running down her face and she is watching the ground as she storms back to the car. so she makes a loud grunt as she slams into someone that she did not see. both people are knocked back a few steps from the force of the collision.}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{whoa! excuse me! miss, are you alright?}
<A>__{thelma nods her head "yes," but tears continue. her crying is silent.}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{is there anything i can do?}
<A>__{thelma shakes her head "no." she tries to control her tears. she notices how blue his eyes are.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{no. thanks. sorry.}
<B>__{thelma}
<A>__{collects herself as she walks back to the car. she gets in and is drying her eyes, looking in the side mirror. in the mirror she sees the hitchhiker come back around from the side of the building. he is several feet behind the car, and she watches him as he removes his long sleeved shirt and stuffs it into his duffel bag. now he is just in t shirt and jeans. he looks good. really good. she watches in the mirror as he picks up his stuff and heads towards the road. she can see him as he's walking. he stops. he's thinking. he heads over to the car.}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{would you mind me asking which direction you and your friend are going? i'm trying to get back to school and my ride fell through, so i'm kinda stuck. are you going my way?}
<A>__{thelma doesn't know what to do.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{umm. i think we're going to oklahoma city. but i'm not sure.}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{do you think you could... i mean, i could help pay for gas.}
<A>__{thelma knows louise isn't going to like this.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{ummm. well, see, it's not really up to me. it's not my car. umm, we'll have to ask my friend, but she'll probably say no. she's a little uptight.}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{well. maybe we better not ask her. but thank you anyway.}
<A>__{now she wants him to come. he starts to walk away from the car.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{well, we can ask her. that won't hurt.}
<A>__{just then louise comes out of the store. she sees thelma talking to this guy and, for one moment, stops dead in her tracks as she takes this in, then continues toward the car. although her face is basically expressionless, we see that it's possible she might kill thelma.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and i thought since...}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{it's probably not a good idea.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{louise.}
<A>__{the hitchhiker just nods and starts walking towards the road.}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{y'all have a nice day. drive safe.}
<A>__{the guy does seem really nice and thelma is really frustrated that louise wouldn't give him a ride, but decides not to confront her.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{see how polite he is? he was really nice.}
<A>__{louise lowers the top and backs the car out. they watch him walk away. louise pulls out of the parking lot onto the road. they pass the hitchhiker. thelma waves.}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<P>__{(to thelma)}
<D>__{you cheer up now!}
<A>__{she turns around in the seat to continue waving. he smiles and waves. they drive down the road. tight shot of the hitchhiker as the smile fades from his face.}
