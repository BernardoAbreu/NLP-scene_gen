<L>__{interior mayflower hotel bar, washington, d.c. night}
<A>__{dark little piano bar. they sit in a quiet corner, com fortable in silence. gene with his martini, amelia with her coke. she's shelling peanuts from a bowl, popping some in her mouth, passing a few over to him.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{if you don't drink, why do you come to bars?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{must be the ambience. and the nuts.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{what worries me is, in some of these bars the nuts are the ambience. specially when they make a pass at you.}
<A>__{she chews, staring at him.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{any guy would have to be nuts to do that. i'm considerable trouble, if you haven't noticed.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{you keep advertising that, but i'm still waiting to see it.}
<A>__{she looks down at her fingers as they shell. barely audible...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{you'll see it.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{well, here's your chance. i'm taking gore to the conference in bermuda. he wants you to come.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{gore, huh?}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{sure. i'm completely indifferent.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i wish.}
<A>__{do you?}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{would make life simpler.}
<A>__{she throws a peanut which boinks off his face. he smiles a suddenly goofy, very non elegant smile.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{actually, i will be in indiana. edward elliot of purdue wants}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{me to build a women's careers department there.}
<A>__{really? he likes that.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{i will be back and forth. when i'm there, i've asked to stay in the dorm with the girls.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{that's a wonderful idea. especially now.}
<A>__{something in the way he said that.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{what's special about now?}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{a good time for some positive press about you as a role model.}
<A>__{her eyes harden. whatever do you mean?}
<P>__{gene (cont’d)}
<D>__{you don't read the papers?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{not unless someone makes me.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{well, someone should. because they're all saying you took recklessly dangerous solo flights for no earthly purpose except publicity. meaning, money.}
<A>__{dead. silence.}
<P>__{gene (cont’d)}
<D>__{they also harp on a growing list of products that you commercially endorse.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{how thoughtless of me to be doing all this in a society where no one else is interested in making money. present company included.}
<A>__{he's not afraid of her.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{look, george had you taking money from the sugar cartel for the hawaii flight, the mexican government for theirs, he's selling commemorative stamps which you carried on the flights...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{if this is about george, just say so. because we made those calls, and we includes me.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{i'm sorry i said it that way. this is actually about you, because i'm picking a fight, apparently a useless one, for the benefit of someone i care about.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{and what's your point? women are held to some higher standard? bankers and industrialists are ad mired for succeeding, but women are just considered selfish and grasping?}
<C>__{gene }
<D>__{of course they are.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{well, let's change that, shall we? or would you just prefer to adopt it, since groveling would be easier.}
<A>__{staring at each other.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{if you want to make money, my guess is that people viewing you as lady lindy, america's sweetheart of the skies, the wife mother daughter they all wished they had. would be helpful.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{thanks for the tip.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{thanks for not being defensive.}
<A>__{full beat.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{well, i'm an open minded girl. and to prove it, i'm hereby resigning as your consultant at the aeronautics branch.}
<A>__{she throws some money on the table for the drinks.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{the public linking of our names does more harm to that image of mine than everything else put together.}
<A>__{she stands up.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{next time you read the papers. try reading between the lines.}
<A>__{walks out. gene makes no move to follow. he's said his piece.}
