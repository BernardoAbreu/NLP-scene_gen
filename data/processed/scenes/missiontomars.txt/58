<L>__{interior mars recovery. lower hab. night}
<A>__{mcconnell, in his cubicle, looks away from the photo of maggie. haunted by memories. he rises, flips through the cds in a storage case, pulls one out. he holds this carefully, hesitating, then feeds it into his computer. immediately his screen saver vanishes and we see}
<B>__{home video of a party}
<A>__{an impromptu celebration, a bunch of friends gathered in a semi darkened living room. the footage is handheld, a bit jerky. people have paper plates of food, beers in hand, everyone is a little tipsy. debra is there, terri, phil, cote, kirov, others. they're watching a still photo sequence, shown on a large screen tv, with commentary by luke and woody.}
<B>__{the first photo}
<A>__{is of a small boy (young mcconnell) in his pajamas, kneeling in front of a christmas tree. he's grinning ecstatically as he holds up a brand new model rocket.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{jim's first ship was seriously underpowered...}
<A>__{laughter at this. some ad lib cracks about the painfully bad haircut and the pajamas.}
<B>__{the second photo}
<A>__{is of a gawky looking teenage girl (young maggie), standing on a porch at night, posing a bit self consciously by a telescope on its tripod.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{maggie was always starstruck...}
<A>__{more laughter, plus some digs about the nerdy eyeglasses and braces. videocamera swings around the room, revealing the adult jim and maggie. they sit side by side on the hearth, leaning into each other, looking very happy.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{i will get you guys for this.}
<A>__{more laughter. everyone's having a great time. the videocamera swings back towards the tv screen as}
<B>__{third photo appears}
<A>__{jim and maggie, young adults, standing on the wing of a fighter jet. both in air force flight suits, helmets in hand. suntanned, cocky, flashing radiant smiles.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{when they met at the air force academy, it was "love at first flight."}
<A>__{groans and laughter from the offscreen watchers.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{after that, nasa training was tough. all jim could think about was exploring a heavenly body. more ribald laughter, as}
<B>__{fourth photo appears}
<A>__{maggie and jim, tethered together, floating weightlessly in space suits.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{but maggie, as you can see, kept him on a short leash. until...}
<B>__{a fifth photo}
<A>__{shows mcconnell, in a dress uniform, leaning in to kiss maggie, who wears a white bridal gown.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{mission accomplished!}
<A>__{angle on mcconnell, in the present as he smiles at this, hearing the renewed laughter and cheers, the ad libbed digs from the video. he becomes aware he's not alone. he looks up.}
<B>__{woody}
<A>__{stands in the doorway of his cubicle. their eyes meet. they both smile, turning back to the video. remembering.}
<B>__{in the video}
<A>__{luke and woody have stepped forward, into shot, standing at the sides of the tv, where the last photo lingers. luke waves his hands, hushing everybody.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{today we celebrate a new chapter in their story. and guys, it's a pretty historic one.}
<A>__{both men raise champagne flutes.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{let's hear it for the newly announced captain and co captain of mars one. to jim and maggie!}
<A>__{cheers at this, repeats of "jim and maggie!" luke grins, giving a little signal, and we see}
<B>__{a final photo}
<A>__{of maggie in jim's arms, both of them in goofy tropical vacation wear, smiling. evidently a photo taken in the surf somewhere, but here it's been crudely superimposed onto a martian landscape. laughter greets this unlikely image.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{when you guys land, it'll prove once and for all there's no intelligent life on mars.}
<A>__{more hoots of laughter, catcalls, but maggie jumps in to protest, as the videocamera swings to her and jim. terri sits nearby.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{hey, c'mon, what if i'm right?}
<C>__{assorted voices}
<D>__{oh no, here we go! don't get her started! somebody put on some music!}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{it's our sister planet!}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{oh brother!}
<A>__{laughter at this, and maggie joins in. she's a good sport.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{maggie, why does this have to be about us? mars is a great opportunity for pure science.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{we'll do the science. and we'll do it very well. that's what we've trained for. but what if there's more...? in all our myths, in every human culture, mars has always held a special attraction. what if that means something? only we don't understand it yet...}
<A>__{the mood of the party is changing, as everyone is caught up in maggie's spell. she has a radiant simplicity. the video camera drifts in on her; we are caught up, too.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{the universe is not chaos. it's connection. life reaches out for life...}
<A>__{she looks at mcconnell, smiles. he takes her hand.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{this is what we were born for, isn't it? to stand on a new world, and look beyond it to the next one. it's who we are.}
<A>__{a silence; the guests are enchanted by the purity of her passion. she smiles, suddenly self conscious. she hadn't meant to get so carried away. in the present mcconnell reaches out, gently taps the keyboard, freezing the screen. he and woody, their eyes shining, stare at her image. a beat.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{yeah. i'm good to go.}
<A>__{woody glances at him. it's true. rather than being saddened, mcconnell seems to have taken on new strength. a renewed sense of wonder.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{after all these years... can you believe it? tomorrow we'll be standing on mars.}
<A>__{woody nods, smiles.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you know what? she may have been right.}
<A>__{mcconnell looks at him.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{if that wasn't a quake down there, then something else caused it. or planned it... you're thinking the same thing.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{it's never been out of my mind.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{jesus. you realize what this means?}
<A>__{mcconnell nods. looks again at maggie's face on the screen.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{she knew, woody. she was the only one of us that ever thought there might be something down there.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{yeah, and we're not leaving until we find out... deal?}
<A>__{mcconnell nods. they clasp hands briefly. deal. then woody turns. before leaving, he hesitates just a moment, turning back. one last thought, and he doesn't know he's going to say it until it comes out.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{maggie was the best of us.}
<A>__{mcconnell looks at him, silent but grateful. woody goes. mcconnell turns back, looking at her smiling face, frozen on the screen.}
