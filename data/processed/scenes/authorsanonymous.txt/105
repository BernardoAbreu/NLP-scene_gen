<C>__{hannah }
<D>__{anyway, i'm quitting.}
<A>__{there. she said it. hannah looks so relieved. she's done. indignant, colette stares her up and down. points to dr. xiroman.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{well, in this case one plus one equals one very successful writing team. i can't believe you, hannah. you're doing this just to upstage our news about landing an agent.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{stop it...}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{no, this is what it's all about. the spotlight always has to be on little miss sunshine. her agent. her book deal. her movie deal.}

<C>__{alan }
<P>__{(to camera)}
<D>__{this was supposed to be a reality series.}
<A>__{that's off his chest. alan leaves henry and hannah alone at the table. awkward silence. he stands up. calmly puts his typed pages back in his satchel. leaves alan's recorder on the table, walks away without looking back.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{henry . . .}
<A>__{don't waste your breath. he's gone.}
