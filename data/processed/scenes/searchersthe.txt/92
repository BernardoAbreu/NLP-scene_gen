<A>__{they drop their rifles now and pull out revolvers for close range work. one comanche breaks through from the side, his buffalo lance ready for the thrust. ethan whirls and fires. the comanche horse charges through the defense line and out and there is a muffled scream of pain from ed nesby.}

<A>__{the charge breaks and comanches wheel left and right, racing back across the river. with magnificent horsemanship, one brave rides to an unhorsed warrior crouched in the shallows and swings him up behind. two others, riding together, head for one of the two dead comanches ethan and mose had downed on their first shots. swinging simultaneously from their saddles, they grab the dead man and carry him off.}
