<L>__{interior barton cottage parlour late afternoon}
<A>__{the dashwoods returning. marianne is taking her bonnet off so furiously that she simply gets the knot tighter and tighter. despite them selves, elinor and mrs dashwood are amused.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{oh! are we never to have a moment's peace? the rent here may be low but i think we have it on very hard terms.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{mrs jennings is a wealthy woman with a married daughter she has nothing to do but marry off everyone else's.}
<A>__{betsy pokes her head out from the dining room.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{there's a parcel arrived for you, miss dashwood!}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{a parcel!}
<A>__{they all crowd into the dining room to find a large package on the table, which margaret is permitted to open. in the meantime elinor comes to the rescue with the bonnet and marianne stands shifting like a spirited mare as elinor patiently unravels the knot.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{it is too ridiculous! when is a man to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity do not protect him?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{infirmity!}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{if colonel brandon is infirm, then i am at death's door.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{it is a miracle your life has extended this far...}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{did you not hear him complain of a rheumatism in his shoulder?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{a slight ache' i believe was his phrase...}
<A>__{marianne smiles and elinor laughs at her. then margaret opens the parcel to reveal her atlas. the atmosphere alters immediately as mrs dashwood and marianne look at elinor in consternation.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{but edward said he would bring it himself.}
<A>__{there is a letter on top of the atlas. close on the address 'to the dashwoods'. mrs dashwood picks it up, looks at elinor, and opens}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{'dear mrs dashwood, miss dashwood, miss marianne and captain margaret it gives me great pleasure to restore this atlas to its rightful owner. alas, business in london does not permit me to accompany it, although this is likely to hurt me far more than it hurts you. for the present my memories of your kindness must be enough to sustain me, and i remain your devoted servant always. e. c. ferrars.'}
<A>__{a silence greets this brief epistle. elinor struggles to contain her bitter disappointment.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{but why hasn't he come?}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{he says he is busy, dear.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{he said he'd come.}
<A>__{margaret is genuinely upset. elinor quietly hangs up marianne's bonnet.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{why hasn't he come?}
<A>__{mrs dashwood looks beseechingly at marianne, who nods and grasps margaret's hand.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i am taking you for a walk.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{no! i've been a walk.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{you need another.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{it is going to rain.}
<A>__{marianne shoves her bonnet back on and drags margaret out.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{it is not going to rain.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{you always say that and then it always does.}
<A>__{we hear the front door slam behind them. there is a short silence.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{i fear mrs jennings is a bad influence.}
<A>__{she approaches elinor.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{you must miss him, elinor.}
<A>__{elinor looks very directly at her mother.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{we are not engaged, mamma.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{but he loves you, dearest, of that i am certain.}
<A>__{elinor looks down. she speaks slowly, choosing her words with care.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i am by no means assured of his regard for me.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{oh, elinor!}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{but even were he to feel such a... preference, i think we should be foolish to assume that there would not be many obstacles to his choosing a woman of no rank who cannot afford to buy sugar...}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{but elinor your heart must tell you }
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{in such a situation, mamma, it is perhaps better to use one's head.}
<A>__{she clears her throat, rises determinedly, picks up the accounts book and opens it. mrs dashwood is silenced.}
