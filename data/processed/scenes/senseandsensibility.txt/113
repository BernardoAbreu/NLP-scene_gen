<L>__{interior mrs jennings's house bedroom night}
<A>__{marianne is sitting on the bed staring into space. elinor is kneeling by her, holding her hands.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{dearest, was i right to tell you?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{whatever his past actions, whatever his present course, at least you may be certain that he loved you.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{but not enough. not enough.}
<L>__{interior mrs jennings's house study day}
<A>__{elinor sits alone with her head in her hands. suddenly mrs jennings hustles in looking pleased.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{here is someone to cheer you up, miss dashwood!}
<A>__{she is followed in by lucy. mrs jennings leaves, busy as ever. lucy plants an expression of ghastly concern on her face.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{how is your dear sister, miss dashwood? poor thing! i must say, i do not know what i should do if a man treated me with so little respect.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i hope you are enjoying your stay with john and fanny, miss steele?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i was never so happy in my entire life, miss dashwood! i do believe your sister in law has taken quite a fancy to me. i had to come and tell you for you cannot imagine what has happened!}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{no, i cannot.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{yesterday i was introduced to edward's mother!}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{indeed?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{and she was a vast deal more than civil. i have not yet seen edward but now i feel sure to very soon }
<A>__{the maid comes back.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{there's a mr edward ferrars to see you, miss dashwood.}
<A>__{there is a tiny frozen silence.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{do ask him to come up.}
<A>__{elinor quite involuntarily sits down and then stands up again. edward is admitted, looking both anxious and eager. as lucy is sitting in the window seat, at first he sees only elinor.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{miss dashwood, how can i }
<A>__{but elinor cuts him off.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{mr ferrars, what a pleasure to see you. you... know miss steele, of course.}
<A>__{edward turns slowly and encounters lucy's glassy smile. he all but blanches. then bows, and clears his throat.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{how do you do, miss steele.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i am well, thank you, mr ferrars.}
<A>__{edward has no notion of what to do or say. he swallows.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{do sit down, mr ferrars.}
<A>__{lucy's eyes are sharp as broken glass. edward remains on his feet, looking helplessly from one woman to the other.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{you must be surprised to find me here, mr ferrars! i expect you thought i was at your sister's house.}
<A>__{this is precisely what edward had thought. he tries to smile but his facial muscles won't work. elinor decides to fetch help.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{let me call marianne, mr ferrars. she would be most disappointed to miss you.}
<A>__{elinor goes to the door, thankful to escape, but marianne prevents her by walking in at that moment. despite her anguish, she is very pleased to see edward and embraces him warmly.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{edward! i heard your voice! at last you have found us!}
<A>__{edward is shocked by her appearance and momentarily forgets his own confusion.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{forgive me, marianne, my visit is shamefully overdue. you are pale. i hope you have not been unwell?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{oh, don't think of me elinor is well, you see, that must be enough for both of us!}
<A>__{marianne gestures to elinor encouragingly but edward seems unable to look at her.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{how do you like london, marianne?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{not at all. the sight of you is all the pleasure it has afforded, is that not so, elinor?}
<A>__{again, marianne endeavours to ignite the lovers. elinor tries to silence marianne with her eyes but to no avail. marianne puts their coolness down to the presence of lucy, at whom she glances with a none too friendly air.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{why have you taken so long to come and see us?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i have been much engaged elsewhere.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{engaged elsewhere! but what was that when there were such friends to be met?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{perhaps, miss marianne, you think young men never honour their engagements, little or great.}
<A>__{elinor is appalled by this remark but marianne does not notice it and turns back to lucy earnestly.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{no, indeed for edward is the most fearful of giving pain and the most incapable of being selfish of anyone i ever saw.}
<A>__{edward makes an uncomfortable noise.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{edward, will you not sit? elinor, help me to persuade him.}
<A>__{now edward can stand it no longer.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{forgive me but i must take my leave }
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{but you are only just arrived!}
<A>__{elinor rises, desperate for them both to go.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you must excuse me, i have a commission to attend to for fanny }
<A>__{lucy jumps in like a shot.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{in that case perhaps you might escort me back to your sister's house, mr ferrars?}
<A>__{there is an extremely awkward pause.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i would be honoured. goodbye, miss dashwood, miss marianne.}
<A>__{he shakes hands with elinor and with marianne, who is silent with dismay. lucy takes edward's arm and looks up at him proprietorially. after a stiff bow and a muttered farewell from edward, they leave. marianne looks at her sister in astonishment.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{why did you not urge him to stay?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{he must have had his reasons for going.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{his reason was no doubt your coldness. if i were edward i would assume you did not care for me at all.}
