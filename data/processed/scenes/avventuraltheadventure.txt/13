<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{meanwhile, on the beach, sandro is also looking for anna, disturbed and amazed that she is not in sight.}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(angrily, to himself)}
<D>__{this is the kind of behavior that drives me crazy!}
<A>__{down at the shore, giulia is getting ready to step on the gangplank and go aboard the yacht but, anxious about anna's whereabouts, she changes her mind and turns back. claudia, also deeply concerned, decides to remain and look around for herself. she turns and starts climbing up towards the rock in an opposite direction than that taken by sandro, who has now reached the top. the search is fruitless; there seems to be no trace of anna. but sandro continues to explore the area, stopping every now and then to call out anna's name. then, looking down over the slope, he notices claudia, giulia and corrado coming towards him.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{did you find her?}
<A>__{none of them answer but it is clear from the worried expressions on their faces that they too have found no trace of anna. still they continue the search, each going off in different directions. claudia, walking over land covered with large white rocks and clumps of dry brush, spots something moving behind one of the bushes. anxiously, she starts to walk up closer. suddenly the branches begin to move and a stray lamb emerges. surprised, but also somewhat relaxed, she turns around and calls out to corrado, who is following her only a short distance away.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{it's a lamb!}
<A>__{corrado looks at her without answering, then stops and notices further up ahead a jumbled pile of rocks which he feels might very well be the ruins he had previously intended to explore. he is about to head towards them but suddenly realizes that giulia is following directly behind him. he quickly changes his direction in an effort to avoid her. sandro comes upon a small stone hut that leans up against a high section of rock. as he starts to approach it, another stray lamb appears, as if from nowhere, and runs off, frightened by sandro's approach. he tries to open the door to the hut but finds it locked. as he looks around the area, uncertain as to his next move, he sees claudia and corrado coming towards him.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{find anything?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{perhaps she's taking a swim somewhere...}
<A>__{though no less concerned over anna's disappearance than any of the others, corrado attempts to lighten the tension by feigning a calm and sensible attitude. taking note of the stone hut before him, he observes it carefully and remarks:}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{it's really a fact there's nothing new under the sun. now, look here. look at this structure... a kind of natural shelter. sandro, that's how you should design your houses.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{me?... i no longer have any interest in building... and, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in milan?}
<A>__{claudia comes up close to the hut and tries to peer through the tiny window but inside it is so dark that nothing can be seen. suddenly, she finds a small piece of bread on the ledge of the window. she picks it up and starts examining it. then, realizing the bread is still fairly fresh, exclaims:}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{somebody must live here!}
<C>__{corrado}
<P>__{(after examining the bread himself)}
<D>__{but anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.}
<A>__{the discussion is suddenly interrupted by the arrival of one of the sailors who has come up from the shore.}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{we had better get started. the storm may break any minute now.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{what do you mean! what about anna?}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(to the seaman)}
<D>__{tell lady patrizia that we can't leave now. in fact, we'll have to make a tour around the island...}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{wouldn't it be better if you told that to the lady yourself. i can't assume the responsibility for keeping the boat here. there's no place to tie it up... and then, you know, it's got a flat bottom, and if the sea gets a little too rough...}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{that doesn't make any difference! if we have to stay, we'll stay!}
