<L>__{interior rita's library two hours later}
<A>__{rita is relentless. sam is exhausted but determined.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{but who are you kidding? isn't lucy already smarter than you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{in some ways. but in other ways, she's not, i think.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{you think?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i think.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{sam. you've got to be firm on this.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i think in other ways i'm smarter than her. smarter than you are, mr. turner. in fact, in some ways i'm smarter than you, judge mcneilly.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{whoa! bring it down.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what parent doesn't want more for their child? to be more than the sum of the parts of the whole of them.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{yeah yeah yeah, but it's one thing for a little girl to love her daddy when she's a baby, but once she loses respect for you, what will you do?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(fierce)}
<D>__{i won't let that happen. i won't.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{how can you say that?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{respect is not just about how smart someone is. smart is not just about how smart someone is.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{but what about lucy? aren't you being selfish? doesn't she deserve a better life? don't you think she's just pretending she's happy to not hurt your feelings?}
<A>__{sam jumps up from the table, trembling with anger.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{lucy is happy! we have fun! we go to denny's, we go to video night. i know how to love her. i know i'm not going to able to go to law school and learn how to be a mean person, but i know how to love. i know how to be her father, mr. turner!}
<A>__{by this time he is face to face with rita, breathing hard, overcome with emotion. rita is unexpectedly near tears. suddenly before she knows it, she is holding sam. the room charged. she speaks tenderly, moved by this awkward boy man.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i know you do, sam. i know you do.}
