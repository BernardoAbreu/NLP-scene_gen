<D>__{...then, when i was driving back tonight after i ended the whole yuck thing..i was feeling human. i'm done with what's his name..a relief... ..and now it can be like it never happened and then i thought that the only hope was that i own that it did happen and that i take my medicine here..because if i'm walking around with what i did and you don't know what i did..there is a real limit to how close we can be..you're with me and i'm this person who has this bad secret and we aren't really on the same page ever again..so the reason i took this chance in telling is because i want us to be good..i want us to be close. i want to feel like you're not nuts to be in love with me..so what i think is we should talk till we pass out .. talk till we're so sick of each other that there's nothing left to do but take the first step out of hell..so please let's not leave this room until you've heard and said everything..please say, okay..}
