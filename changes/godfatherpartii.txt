The MUSICIANS walking unsteadily on the rocky bed, their instruments harsh and blaring. They are followed by six young peasant men, carrying the crude wooden coffin on their shoulders.  Then the widow, a strong large woman, dressed in black, and not accepting the arms of those walking with her. Behind her, not more than twenty relatives, few children and paisani continue alone behind the coffin. Suddenly, we HEAR the shots of the lupara, and the musicians stop their playing.  The entire procession scatters in odd directions along the rocky river bed. The young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin, throwing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground.

At various positions near the gates are men with shotguns, or lupara.  The gates are opened; and the Widow and her boy are shown before DON FRANCESCO, a man in his sixties.  He wears his trousers with suspenders, and an open white shirt sloppily tucked in over his enormous belly.
