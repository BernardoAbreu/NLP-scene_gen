<A>__{x takk troops sound alert. outside the main portal, energy zaps and splinters above ground circuits, collecting to become: i beem, reforming, running, stumbling. some body parts out of sync, catching up.}
<D>__{x takk halt! state encryption code! i beem 027591748594303 }
<A>__{breathless, he loses count. zaps beside himself. again:}

<D>__{you are positive tron was destroyed? i beem i observed it directly! rush turned tron into vaporware!}
<A>__{x takk troops trade looks, impressed.}
<D>__{i beem rush claims to be a user! he must be! he is awesomely skilled!}
<A>__{plexor hardens.}
<D>__{x takk commander users do not exist.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{he is but a randomized program, he got lucky. to our benefit. i beem rush and krod were surrounded by stealth fighters! they were led by another user called flynn!}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{flynn??}
<A>__{plexor's circuitry strobes in dark troubled hues. an image appears on his archive screen: flynn.}
<D>__{i beem yeah, that's the one!}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{flynn... is here? he is the one behind this scheme to crash x net? i beem i know where they are! rush and krod need our help!}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{and what of mega? i beem we couldn't find her. i'm certain they captured her too!}
<A>__{plexor processes his cranial circuits burn deep amber.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{tron is gone, but his user lives?}
<A>__{plexor turns to i beem, grateful. removes i beem's flimsy broken disk, studies it gently.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{good work does not go unrewarded at x net. would you like to be upgraded? i beem yes, plexor, very much so.}
<A>__{plexor energizes a reward portal. shimmering golden light beckons i beem. he eagerly enters and gets zapped. i beem emerges out the other side, a zombie like x net drone, joining a security crew.}
