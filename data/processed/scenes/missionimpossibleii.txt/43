<L>__{ext ambrose house (night)}
<A>__{ethan enters and tears off his mask, revealing ambrose filled with implacable rage. he looks up to see stamp who's been obviously waiting for him. tearing the voice oscillator. leaning with both hands on a counter surveillance monitor table he stares at the floor, his face rictus of hateful intensity.}
<C>__{stamp}
<D>__{you were right. hunt stung mccloy tonight. he knows. they'll be going into biocyte...}
<A>__{ambrose looks up slowly to stamp who's been standing by.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{good..then we go where he'll be, don't we? well done, hugh. well done.}
<A>__{chauffeur's window (interior limo eve) being rapped on by the driver.}
<B>__{mccloy}
<A>__{wakes with a start. the window's lowered billy's in livery.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you're home, guv'ner. home..}
<A>__{it's taking time to register. then:}
<C>__{mccloy}
<D>__{ where's george. my regular driver. where is he?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{took ill, guv'. touch of the flu. they say it's going around. nasty business. mind you don't catch a chill now.}
<A>__{still dazed, mccloy manages to nod and exit the limo. billy drives off. close computer screen biocyte building blueprints (interior sheep farm safehouse) including all specifications.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{luther, do you have the building up and running?}
<A>__{luther punches in and up comes a squat little island a hundred yards off shore, connected to the mainland by a wooden bridge.}
<C>__{ethan }
<D>__{that's not exactly it.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{sorry, that it a biocyte facility, their storage structure..}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{nyah still on the property?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{she hasn't left it.}
<A>__{then:}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{okay, here you go }
<A>__{as luther speaks, the building on his computer graphics, one with the biocyte pharmaceuticals elevators and renderings, is being rapidly morphed to three dimension existence off the rendering specifications by luther, as if the building itself were being constructed at a madly rapid pace, from its foundation to its reinforced steel structure, to its honeycombing of floors, to its outer skin. luther's reconstitution of the building lot static, but moving around and above it even as he proceeds.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{let's start from the inside out.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{all storage and production of chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty second floor, the heart of the building.}
<B>__{biocyte lab}
<A>__{only about eight personnel chemists in lab coats, workers in bio containment suits, etc. populate the lab, passing through security door and air locks, monitoring the virus stock, pading the injection gun, etc.}
<C>__{luther's voice}
<D>__{chimera itself is kept in two places: in production vials in an incubation room and housed in a small airtight chamber inside three injection guns.}
<C>__{billy's voice}
<D>__{mate, you kill it in both places, we're laughin' and we go home.}
<B>__{with luther and ethan}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{now how to get in there.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{no garage entrance. lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.}
<A>__{ethan watches the rendition of the biocyte lobby on screen close ambrose (night) in overhead light, his eyes are dark pits, somehow underlying her saturnine intensity:}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{if you look at hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. for a start he won't go into biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{not going in from the ground. show me the atrium.}
