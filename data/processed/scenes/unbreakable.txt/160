<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{a slightly overweight girl, probably fourteen years old is tied by her wrists with a phone cord to the metal towel rack in her bathroom. she sits with her arms pointed upward over her head. he knees tucked up to her chest. next to her is her younger brother. a skinny boy, maybe twelve. he's tied and seated in the same way. their heads are leaned back against their arms. they're completely listless. eyes half mast. they watch as the door to the bathroom opens and the dark hooded figure of david dunne steps in. his long dark slowing rain poncho still dripping water. he stands in the doorway for a moment before moving towards them. they don't react in anyway as david reaches for the phone cord and unties them. they're arms flop to their laps as they gaze up at the figure leaning over them. they boy blinks once slowly. david takes a step back and stares at them from under his hood.}
