<L>__{interior bar day}
<A>__{it's a busy night. a couple of trucker types are shooting pool as the bartender slings drinks. hal is nursing a beer at the bar when he suddenly notices a very attractive woman sitting next to him. as he goes to straighten his stool posture, hal suddenly catches himself on the bar's television it's a story about how he saved the woman and her baby at the construction site. he turns back to the attractive woman next to him, then back to the tv. a plan of attack is forming.}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(obviously playing it up for the woman's benefit)}
<D>__{oh, there it is again. this is really getting embarrassing now.}
<A>__{the woman looks up at the screen and gives hal a double take.}
<C>__{attractive woman}
<D>__{oh my god! it's you! you're the man who saved that woman and her baby the other day! it is you, isn't it?}
<A>__{trucker #1, getting a drink at the bar next to them,}
<B>__{overhears.}
<A>__{hal rolls his eyes and puts his hands up in the air.}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(to attractive woman)}
<D>__{oh, crap. you got me.}
<A>__{trucker#1 taps hal on the shoulder.}
<D>__{trucker#1 let me tell you something. that was just about the bravest damn thing i've ever witnessed. (he turns to the rest of the bar) hey, everybody! this guy's the hero from tv!}
<A>__{the bar erupts in cheers.}
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{hal is riding on the shoulders of trucker#2 and trucker#3 as `i'm holding out for a hero' plays on the jukebox. trucker#1 suddenly puts his hands in the air. the room quickly goes silent.}
<D>__{trucker#1 i want to give you something.}
<A>__{he reaches into his pocket and takes out a medal. he holds it up in the air for everyone to see.}
<P>__{trucker#1 (cont'd)}
<D>__{lost my whole platoon. they were a lot a good boys, a lot of good boys. that was just the way things were in "the grenada." i'd rather a real hero have this.}
<A>__{trucker#1 gives the medal to a speechless hal.}
<C>__{attractive woman}
<D>__{hey, you're on tv again.}
<A>__{the crowd looks up at the television. television continuous the anchor man, brad helms (early 40's, amazing mustache), suddenly has a memo passed to him.}
<C>__{brad helms}
<D>__{this just in. upon a second look at that tape from this morning, which we'll now replay for you, it appears it was not the heroic act it first seemed to be.}
<A>__{the tape shows hal running in slow motion.}
<D>__{brad helms (o.s.) (cont'd) with the tape slowed down you can actually see the man push the woman and her child out of the way in an effort to save his own life.}
<A>__{the tape shows hal, in a clear act of self preservation, pushing the woman and child out of the way.}
