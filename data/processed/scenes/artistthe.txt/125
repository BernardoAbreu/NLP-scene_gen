<L>__{interior studio peppy & george day}
<D>__{we find peppy and george on a film set, still dancing. the piece of jazz they are dancing to has gone so crazy that now everyone wants to get up and dance! they are dancing a tap number facing the camera, in a decor representing a stylized new york. the choreography is incredible, in the grand style of the old hollywood musicals and they finish with a knee slide that brings them right up to us with big smiles on their faces. the music stops on a powerful blast from the brass instruments that leaves everyone bursting with energy. in the ensuing silence, peppy and george stay exactly where they were, facing the camera, with the smile stuck on their faces. it goes on for a little too long, they are out of breath. then they look at someone off shot. they are facing a film crew (from their era of course). the director smiles. zimmer, sitting next to him, seems ecstatic. the director speaks and we hear what he says.}

<D>__{with pleasure! the end}
<A>__{the credits run while peppy and george go back to their positions. the camera (ours) pulls back and into frame come all the technicians who are setting up the shot, the hair, make up and costume people for continuity, the camera coming into position, the director coming over to say a few words to the star couple, in short: the shot being prepared for another take. and, when everyone is in position, the director speaks into his megaphone and we hear "ok, camera! sound! rolling... and... action!" fade to black and the music picks up again for the end of the credit sequence.}
