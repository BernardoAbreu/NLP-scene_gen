<L>__{interior repair ward continuous}
<A>__{it's a fully automated clinic for broken bots. day care for the malfunctioned. the rejects are kept in force field pens. dozens line the walls. eve and wall e stop at the inspection station. robotic orderly arms activate. wall e shrinks. watches them systematically check in eve. perform an i.d. scan. attach a red "defect" boot to her head. a button is pressed on the boot. eve goes into "sleep" mode. lifted off the transport.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(beeps)}
<D>__{[where are you going?!]}
<A>__{the orderly arms now start on wall e. he escapes before they can place a defect boot on him. races through the ward. wall e runs smack into a defective beautician bot.}
<D>__{beautician bot}
<P>__{(pre recorded)}
<D>__{just a trim? uh huh.}
<A>__{she paints wall e's face with hideous looking make up. holds up a mirror. wall e gasps.}
<D>__{beautician bot you look gorgeous.}
<A>__{wall e is snatched up by an orderly arm. placed in an empty force field pen. sits between a paint bot and vacu bot: ...the broken paint bot flings paint at wall e... ...the vacu bot sneezes dust in his face... across the way a massage bot flails wildly. orderly arms restrain him with an energy straightjacket. eve slides past wall e. carried by an orderly arm. brought into the "diagnostics" room. the frosted glass doors shut.}
