<L>__{exterior woods. day.}
<A>__{from the edge of the woods, a man in a white shirt emerges from behind a tree. the camera swings abruptly to get him. he calls out to the gang.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{surrender!}
<A>__{it is a total surprise. bonnie, clyde and c.w. all grab their guns and fire several shots; they are not firing the big guns now, but the pistols. the man lingers there for a moment he looks strange, white, luminous, like an apparition and then he vanishes into the woods. silence, long enough to make you think it was perhaps an illusion. then there is a volley of gunfire a noise so large as to be almost an impossible sound coming from the woods, all around, everywhere. a ring of little white puffs of smoke emerge from the woods; from every tree a puff of smoke. the camera pans in a circle. behind every tree is a man with a gun. there are at least 150 people out there peace officers, farmers with hunting rifles, kids with squirrel guns, everyone who wanted to come along and catch bonnie and clyde. their number is so large because this time they want no possibility of the gang making what seemed by them supernatural escapes. from this point on, the sound of guns is unnaturally muffled on the sound track. we hardly hear them at all..it is like a dream. without a word, all of the gang including the half dead buck making his final effort, scramble for the nearest car. they run, throughout this battle, crouched, like animals their only thought, to get away, to escape. to fight it out would be ludicrous. from the moment the barrows start in motion, there is shooting again from the edge of the woods. we see them scrambling towards the car, in an extreme long shot, surrounded by the ring of smoke.}
