<L>__{interior eve's suite taft hotel day}
<A>__{old fashioned, dreary and small. the action starts in the living room and continues to the bedroom. addison closes the door, crosses to a comfortable chair.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{suites are for expense accounts. aren't you being extravagant?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{max is paying for it. he and lloyd had a terrific row but lloyd insisted... well. can i fix you a drink?}
<A>__{she indicates a table elaborately stocked with liquor, glasses, etc. addison's eyebrows lift.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{also with the reluctant compliments of max fabian.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{lloyd. i never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish so he sent it up...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{some plain soda.}
<P>__{(eve starts to fix it)}
<D>__{lloyd must be expecting a record run in new haven...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{that's for tonight. you're invited. we're having everyone up after the performance.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{we're?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{lloyd and i.}
<A>__{she carries the soda to him, sits on an ottoman at his feet.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{i find it odd that karen isn't here for the opening, don't you?}
<A>__{he sips his soda and puts away, carefully avoiding a look at eve. as he looks back }
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{addison...}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(blandly)}
<D>__{she's always been so fantastically devoted to lloyd. i would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her }
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(breaks in)}
<D>__{addison, just a few minutes ago. when i told you this would be a night to remember that it would bring me everything i wanted }
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{ something about an old road ending and a new one starting paved with stars...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i didn't mean just the theater.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{what else?}
<A>__{eve gets up, crosses to look out over the common.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(her back to him)}
<D>__{lloyd richards. he's going to leave karen. we're going to be married.}
<A>__{for just a flash, addison's eyes narrow coldly, viciously. then they crinkle into a bland smile.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{so that's it. lloyd. still just the theater, after all...}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(turns; shocked)}
<D>__{it's nothing of the kind! lloyd loves me, i love him!}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{i know nothing about lloyd and his loves i leave those to louisa may alcott. but i do know you.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i'm in love with lloyd!}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{lloyd richards is commercially the most successful playwright in america }
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you have no right to say such things!}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{ and artistically, the most promising! eve dear, this is addison.}
<A>__{eve drops her shocked manner like a cape. her face lights up she crosses back to the ottoman.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{addison, won't it be just perfect? lloyd and i there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, i will make them be great!}
<P>__{(as she sits)}
<D>__{you're the only one i've told, the only one that knows except lloyd and me...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{... and karen.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{she doesn't know.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{she knows enough not to be here.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{but not all of it not that lloyd and i are going to be married.}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{i see. and when was this unholy alliance joined?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{we decided the night before last, before we came up here...}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(increasingly tense)}
<D>__{was the setting properly romantic the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{the setting wasn't romantic, but lloyd was. he woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door he couldn't sleep, he told me he's left karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until i promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. he never went home...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{you sat and talked until it was light...}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(meaningly)}
<D>__{we sat and talked, addison. i want a run of the play contract.}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{there never was, there'll never be another like you.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(happily)}
<D>__{well, say something anything! congratulations, skol good work, eve!}
<A>__{addison rises slowly, to his full height. as eve watches him, as her eyes go up to his, her smile fades }
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{what do you take me for?}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(cautiously)}
<D>__{i don't know what i take you for anything...}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(moving away)}
<D>__{it is possible even conceivable that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i'm sure you mean something by that, addison, but i don't know what...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{look closely, eve, it's time you did. i am addison dewitt. i'm nobody's fool. least of all yours.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i never intended you to be.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{yes, you did. you still do.}
<A>__{eve gets up, now.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i still don't know what you're getting at. right now i want to take my nap. it's important that i }
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(breaks in)}
<D>__{ it's important right now that we talk. killer to killer.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(wisely)}
<D>__{champion to champion.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{not with me, you're no champion. you're stepping way up in class.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly and then get out so i can take my nap!}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{very well, plainly and distinctly. although i consider it unnecessary because you know as well as i, what i am about to say.}
<P>__{(they are now facing each other)}
<D>__{lloyd may leave karen, but he will not leave karen for you.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what do you mean by that?}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{more plainly and more distinctly? i have not come to new haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of yale! i have come to tell you that you will not marry lloyd or anyone else because i will not permit it.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what have you got to do with it?}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{everything. because after tonight, you will belong to me.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i can't believe my ears...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{a dull cliche.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{belong to you? that sound medieval something out of an old melodrama...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{so does the history of the world for the past twenty years. i don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly i had hoped that you would, somehow, have known have taken it for granted that you and}
<C>__{i...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{... taken it for granted? that you and i...}
<A>__{she smiles. then she chuckles, then laughs. a mistake. addison slaps her sharply across the face.}
<C>__{addison}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{remember as long as you live, never to laugh at me. at anything or anyone else but never at me.}
<A>__{eve eyes him coldly, goes to the door, throws it open.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{get out!}
<A>__{addison walks to the door, closes it.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{you're too short for that gesture. besides, it went out with mrs. fiske.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{then if you won't get out, i will have you thrown out.}
<A>__{she goes to the phone.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{don't pick it up! don't even put your hand on it...}
<A>__{she doesn't. her back is to him. addison smiles.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{something told you to do as i say, didn't it? that instinct is worth millions, you can't buy it, cherish it, eve. when that alarm goes off, go to your battle stations...}
<A>__{he comes up behind her. eve is tense and wary.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{your name is not eve harrington. it is gertrude slescynski.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what of it?}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{it is true that your parents were poor. they still are. and they would like to know how you are and where. they haven't heard from you for three years...}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(curtly)}
<D>__{what of it?}
<A>__{she walks away. addison eyes her keenly.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{a matter of opinion. granted. it is also true that you worked in a brewery. but life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. as a matter of fact, it got less and less dull until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(whirls on him)}
<D>__{she never proved anything, not a thing!}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{but the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to new york didn't it?}
<A>__{eve turns and runs into the bedroom, slamming the door. addison opens it, follows close after her... he can be seen in the bedroom, shouting at eve who is offscene.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{that $500 brought you straight to new york didn't it?}
