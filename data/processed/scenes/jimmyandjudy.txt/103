<A>__{judy looks up into the rearview mirror. her eyes are welling up. she looks out the front windshield. jimmy senses that she sees something. he flips the camera around through the front only to see a row of cop cars blocking the highway up ahead. he flips the camera back at her.}

<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{it's a dead end.}
<A>__{judy ignores jimmy. she throws the car into reverse and tries to turn it around and head back the way she came. a faint sound of a helicopter fades up slowly from the background.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{do you hear that?}
