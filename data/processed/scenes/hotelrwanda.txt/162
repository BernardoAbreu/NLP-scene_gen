<A>__{paul clambers out, stumbles, falls. and discovers he's looking at the face of a dead child, a young tutsi girl, her hands clasped on her ears as though to block the sound of her own death an african munz's scream. paul clambers to his feet, sees that the van is on a road littered with dead bodies, men, women, children. he bumps were dead bodies, the van has driven over them. a breeze from the lake blows the fog clear for thirty feet. revealing: a carpet of bodies, hundreds of them sprawled all along the road as far as paul can see. paul wanders stunned among misshapen corpses, made more ghostly by wisps of fog. finally, paul clambers shell shocked back into the van.}
