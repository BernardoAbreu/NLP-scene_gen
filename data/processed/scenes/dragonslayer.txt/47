<D>__{we thank thee, lord, for this divine deliverance. verily is thy presence amongst us, fully manifest in this, thy great work.}
<A>__{galen and valerian look at each other. she takes his hand.}

<D>__{arise, children of the lord and forsake evermore the pagan mysteries. rejoice in the true power of the christian god!}
