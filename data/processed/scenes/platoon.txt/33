<L>__{exterior gardner's position night}
<A>__{at one of the positions doc is working feverishly to knock the life back into gardner who lies there, his shirt stripped off on his cottage cheese belly. a huge sucking chest wound. he's dying. you know it because he knows it. the eyes do the talking, numb, terrorized yet strangely detached, accepting, not protesting or concerned any longer. most of the ambush has assembled and is watching, chris moving in to see. doc is mumbling to him, low key.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{chopper's on the way gardner, hang in there, you gonna be okay ...}
<A>__{but gardner seems unconcerned. things are going on in his head who knows what. and in his eyes there are big tears rolling. then a morphine smile. a sort of goofy gardner smile, maybe thinking about lucy jean, who knows. he's dead.}
