<D>__{there you go.}
<A>__{she hands him two pills and a glass of water. in the background there are party sounds. the nurse leaves. jack fingers the charm around his neck. there is a pause. then the curtain is pulled back. marion enters. she carries a bottle of wine and two cartons of chinese take away. jack is surprised.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how did you know i was here?}

<D>__{now...noodles or rice?}
<A>__{as she opens the cartons, jack watches her, still uneasy.}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{there was a message, wasn't there?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{it's probably easier for you to eat the rice.}

<D>__{nothing about you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{then what?}
