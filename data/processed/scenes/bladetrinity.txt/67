<D>__{don't die on me, you undead motherfucker!}

<D>__{whistler! we need that serum now!}
<A>__{whistler? abigail spins, dispatching the last officer with a kick to the mid section while tossing a pneumatic injector at king. he snatches it, places it in blade's hands. blade injects himself in the neck. moments later, he's reenergized. he looks to king, clear eyed.}

<A>__{crafted from aluminum, its limbs imbedded in key positions with vibration dampening modules, this bow is capable of firing an arrow upwards of 300 feet per second. abigail withdraws a silver arrow with a time delay explosive tip from her quiver, nocks it in her bow and takes aim at }
