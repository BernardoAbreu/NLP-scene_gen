<D>__{i did say some colored men, the intelligent, the educated, and veterans, i qualified it.}
<C>__{james ashley}
<D>__{mr. stevens is furious, he wants to know why you qualified it }
<C>__{schuyler colfax}
<D>__{no one heard the intelligent or the educated part. all they heard was the first time any president has ever made mention of negro voting.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{still, i wish i'd mentioned it in a better speech.}
<C>__{james ashley}
