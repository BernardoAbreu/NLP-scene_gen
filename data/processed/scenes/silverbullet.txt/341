<A>__{lowe is standing by the refrigerator door. he's holding a raw leg of lamb and tearing at it with his teeth. lamb blood smears his face and runs down his arms. he is as human as you or me (in a manner of speaking, as uncle al would say), but when jane speaks, his head snaps up and his eye flares his one eye. the other is covered by a patch.}
