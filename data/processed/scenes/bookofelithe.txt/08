<L>__{exterior abandoned house morning}
<A>__{the gate squeaks shut behind eli as he exits the front yard. he breathes in the air, turns to feel the warm morning sun on his face. then turns away from it and walks on down the road.}
<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{the landscape barren and featureless, road lined with dead trees. eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt. the road is strewn with burned out cars and debris from a world long dead. a warped metal sign by the side of the road reads: litter removal next two miles by: "circuit city". up ahead is a hunched figure by the side of the road. eli arrives to see that it's a young woman. bone thin, dressed in filthy rags. skin plagued by an unpleasant rash. the shopping cart she was pushing has overturned into a roadside ditch, spilling its contents. blankets, tins of food, old clothes. she's on her knees trying to gather it up. she looks up as she sees eli approaching. instantly cowers from him, raising her hands to protect herself. terrified.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{oh. please don't hurt me. here, take anything you want. you want some food? take it.}
<A>__{she offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand. eli stands there looking at her. his expression impossible to read behind the mirrored goggles.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm not going to hurt you.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{that's what the last guys said.}
<A>__{eli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spilled contents. steps forward and offers them to her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{she blinks. unsure. cautiously she reaches out and takes it.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{could you help me? the wheel came off. i can't fix it. maybe if i could get it out of the ditch. but i can't.}
<A>__{eli looks at the cart. it has come to rest in the ditch just inches from a thick bracken hedgerow that lines the road. he looks again at the girl. her faded blouse is unbuttoned, revealing a little cleavage. her skirt torn along the leg, showing more than a little thigh. almost deliberate. he sniffs the air. watches the hedgerow warily. just like the cat he hunted, his senses heightened and on alert. behind the hedge, three roadside bandits are crouched, waiting to pounce. each armed with a crude blunt weapon. they exchange anxious looks. eli sniffs the air again then backs away from the girl.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{one good thing about no soap any more. you can smell the road agents a mile off.}
<A>__{the girl's face falls as eli backs up. the three bandits emerge from the hedgerow, brandishing their weapons. a couple of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to eli's. the bandit leader grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he passes, yanking her painfully to her feet.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{dumb bitch. what did we tell you?}
<A>__{he pushes her away, she crumples to the road in a heap. eli backs away, but two more armed bandits drop from hiding in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{what you got there in the pack?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{yeah, that's what they all say. how about you take it off real slow and tip it out so's we can take a look?}
<A>__{bandit #2 notices the shotgun strapped to the pack.}
<D>__{bandit #2 he's got a gun.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{shit, it ain't loaded. they never are. ain't that right, old man?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{open the fucking pack or die.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i can't do that.}
<A>__{the bandit leader steps forward aggressively. now within striking distance of eli. he grins, teeth filthy and rotten.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{want us to do it for you? we can get it off real easy after we've hacked your fucking arms off.}
<A>__{eli remains perfectly calm. and though he speaks with a soft, even tone, there is something formidable about his voice.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's real important you boys listen to me and understand. the man i work for, you do not want to cross him. see, i'm under his protection. you stand in my way, you stand in his. and he will cut you down with a righteous fury through me. for i am his faithful instrument.}
<A>__{beat. the bandit leader looks at eli incredulously... and then laughs. the other bandits laugh along nervously.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{what the hell are you, some kinda preacher?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{well i got news for you, preacher man. whatever kinda god you reckon yourself to be working for, he left these parts a long time ago. he ain't here to protect your ass. now take off the pack and set it on the ground.}
<A>__{eli doesn't move, doesn't say a word. the bandit leader takes another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{you fucking listening to me?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i hear you. you lay that hand on me again and you will not get it back.}
<A>__{the other bandits exchange nervous looks. this is not how it's supposed to go.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{all right, i had just about enough of this shit...}
<A>__{he lunges forward, grabs the shoulder strap of eli's pack. if you blinked, you missed it. but somehow eli has now drawn his sword. a rivulet of blood snakes down along the blade and drips onto the asphalt. bandit leader's hand is still gripped firmly around eli's shoulder strap. but it's no longer connected to his arm. the severed hand hangs there from the strap, dripping blood. bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump where his hand once was. looks at it in shock and horror.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{what... you just... he just cut my fucking hand off! my fucking hand!}
<A>__{eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto the road as bandit leader's legs give out and he slumps to the asphalt. his eyes dart around, as though confused.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{what you standin' around for? kiss him! bandit #3 what's he talkin' about, kiss him?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{he's in shock. he means "kill him".}
<A>__{a tense beat. and then the four remaining bandits attack eli all at once, weapons flailing. eli flourishes the sword. a blur, too fast to follow. but it's clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill. it is over in moments. the four bandits lay slain in the road, blood pooling out onto the asphalt. the bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand, a few yards away. eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i told you you wouldn't be getting that back.}
<A>__{bandit leader looks up to see the figure of eli bearing down on him, silhouetted ominously against the sun. he looks for a moment like an avenging angel, something not of this world.}
<C>__{bandit leader}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{my name is eli.}
<A>__{and with that, eli runs him through with his sword. he turns to see the young woman slumped in the road, sobbing. she cowers again as he approaches, certain that she is nexterior he walks past her. sheathes his sword, then pulls out the shopping cart from the ditch and rights it. the woman watches incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{take it and go on your way. and don't fall in with men like these again. no good can come.}
<A>__{she looks at him, puzzled.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<A>__{eli says nothing. walks back to the slain bandits, crouches beside them and begins searching their bodies. he takes a scarf from around the neck of one. finds a zippo lighter on another, checks that it works and pockets it.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{the five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch, half covered with dirt. the best burial they are going to get. eli stands before them, head bowed in prayer. he speaks quietly and quickly, a speech he has given many times.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{god, the father of mercies, through the death and resurrection of his son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the holy spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins.}
<A>__{the young woman stands a few yards away, watching him, transfixed. she has never seen anyone like him.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{through the ministry of the church may he give you pardon and peace, and i absolve you from your sins in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit. amen.}
<A>__{he turns and walks away down the road, passing the woman.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{thank you. you're... a good man.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{there are no good men on the road.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{west.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{can... can i come with you?}
<A>__{he doesn't even turn back to look at her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he walks on, into the horizon.}
