<B>__{downtown boston}
<A>__{as we open we see the inside of an enormous church. a young looking priest in his mid thirties is finishing the delivery of the lords prayer. in the back of the church, in the last pew, there are two who kneel on the cold, stone floor. they do not stand to sing, nor do they offer signs of peace when told, but they pray. they grip and rub their rosaries. they mutter their words in latin. connor and murphy macmanus (mid twenties) are shrouded in thick waist length navy p coats, worn leather boots and the hungry clothes of the poor. the boys heads are shaved and they have facial hair.}
<C>__{monsignor}
<P>__{(dismissing young priest)}
<D>__{thank you father macklepenny, for coming all the way across town to be our guest speaker today. i hope you found our little parish to your liking.}
<A>__{macklepenny takes his seat on the alter along side the regular priests of the church. the macmanus brothers suddenly stand, as all others remain seated. each church goer between them and the aisle shifts his her position to allow the boys passage, as if on command. the two turn and begin to stride for the alter, eyes down, determined.}

<P>__{(thick irish accent)}
<D>__{they've never been like anyone else. from the moment they were born, of the same womb, on the same day, they just had their own way, my boys did. and i always knew that one day they would do something of true greatness. i just never expected they would bring about such a... such a reckoning.}
<A>__{the macmanus brothers are fraternal twins. as annabelle macmanus speaks, macklepenny is taken aback as he scans the congregation amazed to find that he is the only one who thinks this out of the ordinary. the monsignor begins his sermon. macklepenny rises to stop the boys from this disgraceful disturbance. the elder clergyman finds macklepenny's arm, keeping him seated while shaking his head. macklepenny's confusion gives way to awe as he watches the brothers step onto the altar, brush by the six seated priests, and approach the enormous crucifix. they both fall to their knees and kiss the feet of christ. they rise and as abruptly as they came, they turn and head back down the aisle for the front door. they stop at the rear of the church, turning to listen to the sermon.}
<C>__{monsignor}
<P>__{(loud, authoritative)}
<D>__{...and i am reminded of this holy day of the sad story of kitty geneviese. this poor soul cried out time and time again for help but no person answered her calls. though many saw, not one so much as called. her assailant wiped the bloody knife off on her lifeless little body. they watched as he simply walked away. nobody wanted to get involved. nobody wanted to take a stand... we must fear evil men and deal with them accordingly but what we must truly guard against, what we must fear most}

<A>__{they crash through the ceiling right above the fat man's head. the rope gets caught and slams the boys to a halt, hanging them upside down, back to back about six feet above the floor. they are turning in circles. the boss is balled up in the fetal position on the floor. the shocked russians say only a word or two in panic before the macmanus brothers react, reaching for their guns. the russians start to reach for their guns. it's too late. the boys draw and fire as they spin. taking four shots apiece. there are eight dead russians. chests explode as they fall back on the couch in a loose circle. one victims is blasted over the couch. they notice the fat man directly beneath them. murphy grabs his rambo knife, reaches up and cuts the rope. they land in a heap, scramble over to the doomed man and place him on his knees. they each put a gun to the back of his head and recite this prayer in perfect unison.}

<A>__{with the silenced pop from their guns we cut the sound and go to black and white. (slo mo) choral music starts with latin script being read in the background. they take their rosaries out. they slowly walk around, mumbling prayers as they care for the dead. they gently turn over the bodies that were on their stomachs. they brush the hair back from the victims faces. they place pennies in the eyes of al the corpses. when they finish their ritual, they pull off their masks and look at each other. they start to grin and look around. they work each other into a healthy chuckle.}
