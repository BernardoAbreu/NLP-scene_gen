<A>__{grady slides in next to q, puts the car in gear, and starts to pull away. as he glances in the rearview, he sees crabtree smiling darkly in the backseat.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{all right, what's the matter?}
<A>__{crabtree just keeps smiling.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{christ, crabs, what do you expect me to do? the kid's practically in a coma.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{tripp.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{hit your brakes.}
<A>__{grady flicks his eyes from the rearview mirror just as a shadow looms in his headlights. as he squashes the break pedal, q's eyeglasses go flying into the windshield.}
<C>__{q}
<P>__{(squinting)}
<D>__{oh my god! what is that?}
<A>__{it's vernon, waving his arms, his shadow enormous in the beams of light.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{what's this guy's problem?}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{just go around him.}
<A>__{grady taps the accelerator, but each time, vernon dances back in front of grady's grille.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{back up. go out the other way.}
<A>__{grady throws the car in reverse, backs straight up, then turns up a one way street. he shoots down the alley behind the hi hat, turns onto the adjoining street, ..and watches in amazement as vernon materializes from behind the high wooden fence that runs parallel to the galaxie. as grady pinches the brakes, vernon grins.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{now what?}
<C>__{q}
<P>__{(mischievously)}
<D>__{you could always go over him.}
<A>__{then, as the three men watch, vernon rocks back on his heels and with a gymnast's precision pitches himself onto the galaxie's big hood. he lands on his ass, slides smoothly off, then takes a deep bow and disappears into the night.}
<C>__{q}
<D>__{what just happened?}
<A>__{grady peers at the wrinkled asterisk on his hood.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i just had my car jumped on.}
