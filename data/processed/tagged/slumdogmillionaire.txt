<L>__{interior javed's safe house. bathroom. night.}
<A>__{an expensive bathroom suite. excess of marble and gold taps. into the bath, a hand is scattering rupee notes. hundreds and hundreds of notes, worth hundreds of thousands of rupees. the sound of a fist thumping on the bathroom door, furious shouting from the other side.}
<D>__{javed o s salim! salim!}
<L>__{interior studio. backstage. day.}
<A>__{darkness. then, glimpses of faces. in the half light, shadowy figures move with purpose. an implacable voice announces.}
<D>__{talkback v o ten to white out, nine, eight, seven...}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{are you ready?}
<A>__{silence. a hand shakes a shoulder a little too roughly.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{i said are you ready?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{yes.}
<L>__{interior javed's safe house. bathroom. night.}
<A>__{the thumping at the door continues. the sound of mumbled indian prayer. dull gleam of a pistol. a hand cracks the chamber open. loads a single bullet into the chamber, snaps the chamber shut.}
<D>__{talkback v o ...three, two, one, zero. cue prem, cue applause...}
<A>__{suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through. a burst of gun fire and white light as suddenly...}
<L>__{interior studio. night.}
<A>__{...we are back in the studio, the gun fire morphing into rapturous applause.}
<D>__{talkback v o go, prem.}
<A>__{a wall of light and noise as the two walk on stage. cheering, music, banks of searing studio lights. on stage, jamal, an eighteen year old indian boy man stares, petrified. he would surely turn and run but for the iron grip on his shoulder of the smiling host, prem kumar.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{welcome to who wants to be a millionaire!}
<A>__{more applause.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{please give a warm welcome to our first contestant of the night a local from our very own mumbai!}
<A>__{under cover of the wild applause, prem ushers jamal towards the guest's chair, leaning in and hissing.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{smile, dammit.}
<A>__{the lights seem to bore into him but jamal manages a tentative smile. out of nowhere, a hand slaps him ferociously across the face. then again and again. blood trickles from his mouth.}
<L>__{interior police interview room. night.}
<A>__{the studio lights have seamlessly transformed into the harsh bulb of an interrogation light. jamal is strung from the ceiling by his arms.}
<C>__{constable srinivas}
<D>__{your name, bhen chod.}
<A>__{constable srinivas's hand pulls back jamal's head by the hair, forcing him to stare directly into the lights.}
<C>__{constable srinivas }
<D>__{your name!}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{jamal malik.}
<A>__{and seamlessly we are back....}
<L>__{interior studio. night.}
<A>__{...on the set of who wants to be a millionaire. prem leans back in his chair, a man at home in his surroundings. jamal sits opposite, frozen.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{so, jamal, tell us a bit about yourself.}
<A>__{close on jamal's face. without warning, it is shoved under water.}
<L>__{interior bucket. night.}
<A>__{we look up from the bottom of the bucket at the screaming face of a drowning man. his head shakes desperately, pointlessly. then jamal's face is dragged up again, roaring for breath. close on his eyes.}
<D>__{jamal v o i work in a call centre. in juhu.}
<L>__{interior studio. night.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{a phone basher! and what type of call centre would this be?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{xl 5. mobile phones.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{aha! so, you're the man who rings me up every single day of my life with special offers, huh?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{no, actually, i'm an assistant.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{an assistant phone basher?}
<A>__{a raised eye brow at the audience. amusement ruffles through them.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{and what does an assistant phone basher do, exactly?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{i i get tea for people and }
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{ a chi wallah! why didn't you say?}
<A>__{laughter in the audience.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{so, ladies and gentlemen, jamal malik from mumbai, let's play who wants to be a millionaire...!}

<L>__{interior police interview room. day.}
<A>__{jamal's body dangles motionless from the ceiling. his head is bowed and he is moaning to himself. the ceiling fan thumps round slowly. in the corner, constable srinivas mops his brow and lights a cigarette. hot work. the door opens and the inspector of police walks in. a rumpled man in his late forties who has seen pretty much everything. he eyes jamal, surprised.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{has he confessed, yet?}
<C>__{constable srinivas}
<D>__{apart from his name, i can't get a word out of the runt.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{you've been here all bloody night, srinivas. what have you been doing?}
<A>__{srinivas shrugs.}
<C>__{constable srinivas}
<D>__{tough guy.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{a little electricity will loosen his tongue.}
<A>__{constable srinivas brings a box and a tangle of wires out of a cupboard and proceeds to put crocodile clips on jamal's fingers. the inspector stares, deep in thought. sweat trickles down his face. he wipes it away with a handkerchief, seems to be talking to himself.}
<C>__{inspector }
<D>__{every night i get home, "why can't we have a c like bajan chacha?}
<C>__{inspector }
<D>__{why don't you care about your poor family, dying in this heat." twenty four years a policeman and i can't afford bloody a c.}
<A>__{turns on jamal.}
<C>__{inspector }
<D>__{but you. you've got ten million rupees ek dum guaranteed, yaar? and who knows how much further? fancy the twenty million, do you?}
<A>__{jamal just stares.}
<C>__{inspector }
<D>__{i think you probably do.}
<A>__{the inspector nods absently to constable srinivas who turns a handle. jamal's body pulsates and jerks. he screams. his body goes limp again. the inspector goes over to jamal.}
<C>__{inspector }
<D>__{so. were you wired up? a mobile or a pager, correct? some little hidden gadget? no? a coughing accomplice in the audience? microchip under the skin, huh?}
<A>__{constable srinivas hadn't thought of that. grabs jamal's arms and starts squeezing them all over until the inspector has had enough.}
<C>__{inspector }
<D>__{srinivas! look, it's hot, my wife is giving me hell, i've got a desk full of murderers, rapists, extortionists, assorted bum bandits...and you. why don't you save us both a lot of time? hmm?}
<A>__{jamal doesn't answer. the inspector sighs and sits down. looks at his watch, nods at constable srinivas again. jamal's body jerks with electric current. when the shudders and screams have subsided, the inspector goes over to jamal's collapsed form. clicks his fingers in front of jamal's face to check for a response.}
<C>__{inspector of police}
<D>__{he's unconscious, chutiya. what good is that? how many times have i told you ?}
<C>__{constable srinivas}
<D>__{sorry, sir.}
<A>__{an excited young police constable sticks his head around the door.}
<C>__{young constable}
<D>__{he's coming! sir.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{are wa, srinivas, we'll have amnesty international in here next, peeing their pants about human rights. get him down, tidy him up, for god's sake.}
<A>__{constable srinivas goes over to jamal and starts to undo the crocodile clips.}
<C>__{constable srinivas}
<D>__{maybe he did know the answers.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{have you gone soft, srinivas? professors, lawyers, doctors, general knowledge wallahs never get beyond sixteen thousand rupees. and he's on ten million? what the hell can a slum dog possibly know?}
<A>__{jamal lifts his head.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{the answers.}
<A>__{he lifts his head, spits blood out of his mouth and says again, straight into the inspector's face.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{i know the answers.}
<A>__{titles. slum dog millionaire.}
<L>__{exterior cricket ground. day.}
<A>__{bright sunlight filtered through the ever present mumbai dust. a group of children are playing cricket on a tarmac cricket ground. they are bare foot, dressed in little more than rags, wiry skinny and fast on their feet. salim, a nine year old, polishes the ball on his almost non existent shorts, comes in with surprising speed and bowls. the batsman hooks it high in the air. the bowler screams at a boy in the outfield.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{jamal! catch it! catch it!}
<A>__{the seven year old jamal stares up at the ball, jinks around trying to get into position. he pays no heed to the rest of the children who are scattering fast to the edges of the tarmac. the ball seems suspended in the blue sky. shouts from the other children seem very far away. he doesn't notice that they are screaming for him to get out of the way. jamal adjusts his feet for the perfect catch. then out of nowhere, a light aircraft almost takes his head off as it comes in to land on the tarmac runway. jamal is knocked to his feet by the down draft of the plane. the ball bounces away. also flattened, salim gets to his feet.}
<C>__{salim }
<D>__{how could you drop that? it was a sitter.}
<A>__{then salim's face turns to one of alarm.}
<L>__{exterior airport perimeter. day.}
<A>__{at the back of a pack of children, carrying a piece of wood crudely fashioned into a sword, jamal is running for his life, pursued by an ancient but surprisingly nimble security guard from the airport who is screaming abuse and wielding a long stick. the kids dash across a rubbish dump and disappear down dozens of tiny lanes that run in between the shacks of the slum.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{private ka land! private ka land! the planes won't kill you, mader chod, i will!}
<A>__{jamal and salim also with a wooden sword break off, head down a separate lane. the guard pursues them.}
<L>__{interior juhu slum. day.}
<A>__{the lanes in between the corrugated iron shacks are three feet wide, with an open drain running down the middle. many of the precarious upper floors of the shacks have been built right over the paths, turning them into black tunnels. tunnels shot through with slivers of light. if you didn't live here, you would be lost and frightened in minutes. but these children are natives and with the practice of many years, jamal and salim zig zag down the warren of lanes. they dodge past people cooking in the doorways, sleeping, washing clothes or in the case of vinod, a naked four year old, pissing into the drain. salim shouts a warning.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{vinod! musketeers coming through!}
<A>__{without breaking step, they both jump expertly over the stream of piss. not so the security guard who gets it all over his trousers, but doesn't stop the pursuit. the two children charge past a shack filled to the roof with chickens in cages who all start squawking. they break out into the sunlight of the `main road' of the slum lined with shops. it is packed: with people, stalls, bicycles and cows. all modern india is here, drinking tea, shouting at each other, selling food, playing carom, video games. leaving a trail of shouting and wreckage behind them, the pair approach a brand new mercedes almost blocking the lane. beside it stands javed, an impressive man in a beautiful suit and his two minders. jamal and salim skid to a stop, put their hands together in respectful greeting and edge ever so carefully past the immaculate paintwork of the car. still in pursuit, the security guard also slides carefully past the car with deprecating bows and smiles. on past the chi stall where a crowd has gathered to watch a hindi film blaring from the tv rigged up overhead. the irate security guard gets tangled up in a bicycle. jamal and salim stop to give him a taunting, hip gyrating parody of the dance on the tv before scooting down another tunnel. they break out into sunlight again.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{jamal!}
<A>__{jamal skids to a halt, bumping into salim who is already frozen.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{shit. mummy ji.}
<C>__{jamal's mother}
<D>__{don't you move a muscle.}
<A>__{the security guard arrives and he too skids to a halt at the sight of jamal's mother.}
<C>__{jamal's mother }
<D>__{thank you, mister gupta. i will deal with these two.}
<A>__{the guard puts his hands together in grudging respect as jamal's mother lifts each skinny kid off the floor by their t shirt and marches them down the road.}
<L>__{interior school. day.}
<A>__{the two renegades are dumped by jamal's mother into their desks as mister nandha hands out ancient school books.}
<C>__{mister nandha}
<D>__{so, the musketeers return. we are honoured. salim. or porthos, isn't it?}
<A>__{he crashes the heavy book down on his head. salim opens the book. jamal glances over and turns the book the right way round for salim.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{i know!}
<A>__{mister nandha hovers over jamal's head. he winces in anticipation.}
<C>__{mister nandha}
<D>__{and athos.}
<A>__{the book comes down like thunder. jamal blinks from the impact and suddenly we are back....}
<L>__{interior inspector's office. day.}
<A>__{... in the inspector's office. jamal watches srinivas fiddling with the video recorder, trying to get a picture. through the pebbled glass, jamal sees shapes moving along the corridor.}
<L>__{interior corridor. police station. day.}
<A>__{the commissioner of police is fawning along beside prem as they walk. the young constable hurries behind.}
<C>__{commissioner of police}
<D>__{it is so kind of you to visit our station, sir. a great honour.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{not at all, not at all. i hope you will visit us, commissioner.}
<A>__{out of his jacket pocket comes a couple of tickets.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{bring the family. it's a lot of fun.}
<C>__{commissioner of police}
<D>__{oh! a thousand thanks, sir. missus janda will be overcome.}
<A>__{he turns to the young constable.}
<C>__{commissioner of police}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{chi, you lazy chutiye, chi!}
<A>__{the inspector joins them in the corridor.}
<C>__{commissioner of police}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{ah, inspector! cracked it?}
<A>__{the inspector moves his head. maybe yes, maybe no.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{nearly, sir.}
<A>__{the commissioner is just able to contain his apoplexy.}
<C>__{commissioner of police}
<D>__{nearly? nearly? when prem kumar himself has }
<A>__{prem holds up a tolerant hand to the commissioner who falls silent. turns his laser like charm onto the inspector.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{inspector. how good to meet you. clearly the kid cheated.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{clearly, sir.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{so, it is just a question of how, no?}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{indeed, sir. the proof. that is all we need.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{we are lucky to have a man of your obvious experience on the case. this kid might run rings around us filmi types, but he won't make fools out of the mumbai police force, i can see that.}
<A>__{forced laughter from the commissioner.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{in front of sixty million people.}
<A>__{more laughter. and fear.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{which is what will happen if we don't get a result, gentlemen. he goes back on the show to rob us all with the whole of india watching. but. i can rely on you.}
<A>__{prem walks away down the corridor. stops and turns, apparently casual.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{has he has he made any allegations?}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{allegations?}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{he's a cunning one. a convincing liar. don't be taken in, inspector, don't be taken in.}
<A>__{walks off. the inspector stares after him. goes back into his office.}
<L>__{interior inspector's office.}
<A>__{srinivas has finally got the recorder to work. we get snatches of filmi dancing heroines singing on mountainsides surrounded by implausible numbers of flags cricket and finally after some shouting by the inspector, who wants to be a millionaire?.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{so, mister malik, the man who knows the answers. talk.}
<A>__{we close in on the tv screen where prem is smiling his crocodile smile and find ourselves....}
<L>__{interior studio. night.}
<A>__{...as prem asks the first question.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{so, are you ready for your first question for one thousand rupees?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{not bad money to sit in a chair and answer a question. better than making the tea, no?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{no. yes. no.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{no. yes. no. apka final answer?}
<A>__{laughter from the audience. jamal looks confused. prem waves it away, switches on his serious face.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{remember, you have three lifelines if you're not sure of your answer ask the audience, 50 50 and phone a friend. so, the question:}
<A>__{the lights go down, the portentous music rolls.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{who was the star of the 1973 hit film zanjeer. was it a }
<A>__{close on jamal's eyes.}
<L>__{interior shack. night.}
<A>__{a tiny shack. a garland of dirty plastic flowers surrounds a torn flyer for one of amitabh bacchan's films.}
<L>__{exterior juhu slum. rubbish dump. night.}
<A>__{salim is sitting on a chair at the end of a rickety wooden pier, though it is not water, but a sea of rubbish and sewage that lies below them. there are dozens of these piers protruding from the slum onto airport land, each with a toilet shack perched right at the end. another man hurries up the pier and hands salim a coin.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{immediately, sir.}
<A>__{turns to the toilet door.}
<C>__{salim }
<D>__{bhai, get out of there. prakash wants a shit.}
<C>__{jamal o.s.}
<D>__{not finished.}
<C>__{prakash}
<D>__{stop your time pass. this is urgent.}
<C>__{jamal o.s.}
<D>__{it's a shy one. since when was there a time limit on a crap?}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{since there was a customer waiting, that's when.}
<A>__{he flashes another placatory smile at prakash.}
<C>__{jamal o.s.}
<P>__{(singing grunting)}
<D>__{come on out, you beauty, unveil yourself, my darling warling....}
<C>__{prakash}
<D>__{look, kid, i got a bad stomach. it's borderline....}
<A>__{a disturbing combination of heaving and snake charmer noises come from the toilet shack. finally prakash can stand it no longer.}
<C>__{prakash }
<D>__{i'm off to devi's bog. give me that.}
<A>__{he snatches the coin back from salim and hurries off. salim bangs on the toilet door.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{you just lost me good money, you stupid idiot }
<A>__{salim stops. in the distance, there is the faint sound of shouting, a crowd coming closer. then the crowd bursts through the outer shacks of the slum, pour onto the rubbish dump and make for the airfield.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{it's amitabh! that's his helicopter!}
<C>__{jamal o.s.}
<D>__{amitabh? amitabh bacchan?}
<L>__{int exterior toilet. night.}
<A>__{jamal peers through one of the many cracks in the shack. he sees crowds surging around the pier, charging towards a landing helicopter. salim shoves the chair under the door handle effectively locking it and runs down the pier to join the chase. jamal pulls up his shorts.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{no! wait! salim, sala! salim!}
<A>__{rattles the locked door. pulls a torn flyer from his pocket advertising an amitabh movie.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{wait! amitabh....}
<A>__{he looks down the toilet hole at the sewage beneath him, the landing helicopter, the disappearing crowd. a final rattle of the door. there is only one way out. he jumps down the hole, sprawling headlong into a year's worth of human waste, managing to keep the flyer out the mire. he runs for the helicopter.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{amitabh ji! amitabh ji!}
<A>__{salim is at the back of the crowd, trying to force a way through, but the adults shove him back. not so for jamal. the down draft from the helicopter flicks bits of sewage from his clothes. disgusted fans curse him and get out of his way. suddenly, the red sea parts and there is nobody between jamal and amitabh bacchan getting out of the helicopter.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{please. amitabh ji.}
<A>__{jamal holds out his flyer. used to signing autographs, the movie star barely looks at jamal. he takes the flyer and scribbles his autograph on it.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{a thousand thanks, amitabh ji.}
<A>__{he hands the flyer back to jamal as his bodyguards surround him and hustle him into a car. jamal chases the flyer across the tarmac, grabs it. kisses it.}
<L>__{exterior juhu slum. night.}
<A>__{from high up, the rickety tin roof tops of the slum seem to stretch to the horizon. there is a distant shout, a figure waving an arm.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{it's coming!}
<A>__{then another shout and another, a chain of voices coming closer. people come out of their doorways with pails and buckets. the shouts come closer until we see a naked figure entirely encased in bubbles dancing and singing in the lane. jamal is the happiest boy in the slum.}
<C>__{jamal}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{amitabh, amitabh, oh amitabh!}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{i have your autograph, oh, holy amitabh!}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{here it comes!}
<A>__{water comes bubbling through a hose and jamal's mother hoses down her ecstatic son.}
<L>__{exterior juhu slum. night.}
<A>__{not far away, salim wanders to mister chi's stall. he glances around to make sure everybody is glued to the hindi film on mister chi's tv and surreptitiously slips mister chi the signed flyer. mister chi takes a look and gives salim a small wad of rupees. he sticks the money in his pocket, slinks away.}
<L>__{exterior juhu slum. night.}
<A>__{a tear stained jamal is furiously trying to batter salim, but salim's extra strength and height means that he can keep jamal at bay with one hand, jamal's flailing fists punching thin air.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{sala! sala!}
<A>__{salim's laughter only makes jamal cry harder.}
<L>__{interior inspector's office. night.}
<A>__{close on the tv screen in the inspector's office. prem ponders jamal's choice. presses a button on his computer.}
<D>__{prem v o you chose a amitabh bacchan. guess what? you just won one thousand rupees!}
<A>__{applause on screen. the inspector looks at jamal. jamal shrugs.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{you don't have to be a genius.}
<C>__{constable srinivas}
<D>__{i knew it was amitabh.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{like i said.}
<A>__{constable srinivas twists jamal's arm behind his back, evincing a squeal of pain from jamal.}
<C>__{jamal }
<P>__{(squealing)}
<D>__{he's the most famous man in india...!}
<A>__{the inspector stares at jamal, turns back to the tv where prem is asking the next question.}
<D>__{prem o s for four thousand rupees....the national emblem of india is a picture of three lions. what is written underneath? is it...}
<L>__{interior studio. night.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{...a) the truth alone triumphs. b) lies alone triumph. c) fashion alone triumphs. d) money alone triumphs.}
<A>__{prem shoots a mock puzzled look out to the audience eliciting giggles from them.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{what do we think, jamal? the most famous phrase in our country's history. maybe you want to phone a friend?}
<A>__{laughter from the audience. the studio lights bear down on jamal. a drop of sweat trickles down his forehead. prem is loving his discomfort.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{or ask the audience? i have a hunch they might just know the answer. what do we think?}
<A>__{he gestures expansively at his audience. oh, they love him.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{prem}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{jamal}

<A>__{prem whistles. raises his eyes at the audience.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{well, you're the contestant, jamal.}
<C>__{prem }

<A>__{the lights dim. portentous music.}
<L>__{interior inspector's office. day.}
<A>__{the inspector presses pause. sighs.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{so, jamal. my five year old daughter knows the answer to that, but you don't. strange for a millionaire genius. what happened? your accomplice nip out for a piss, did he? or did he just not cough loud enough?}
<A>__{silence. constable srinivas kicks jamal's chair.}
<C>__{constable srinivas}
<D>__{the inspector asked you a question.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{how much is bhelpuri at jeevan's stall on chowpatty beach?}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{one bhelpuri. how much?}
<C>__{constable srinivas}
<P>__{(can't help himself)}
<D>__{ten rupees.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{wrong. fifteen since divali. who stole constable varma's bicycle outside dadar station last thursday?}
<C>__{inspector}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{you know who that was?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{everyone in juhu knows that. even five year olds.}
<A>__{despite himself, the inspector laughs. then leans in.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{i will give you five hundred rupees if you just admit it. you go home, i go home. everybody happy.}
<A>__{jamal just stares back.}
<C>__{inspector }
<D>__{no, you want to go back on the programme and win twenty million rupees, don't you?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{wouldn't you?}
<L>__{interior studio. night.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{the audience has chosen. and, whaddya know? ninety nine percent of them think the answer is a). the truth alone triumphs. what do we think, jamal? a hundred percent would have made me a little more reassured, maybe....}
<A>__{prem shrugs, makes a show of examining his computer. suddenly fixes him with his eyes.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{are you married, jamal?}
<C>__{jamal}
