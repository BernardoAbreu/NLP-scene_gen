<L>__{int day: woltz's bedroom (summer 1945)}
<A>__{it is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man, presumably woltz, is sleeping. soft light bathes the room from the large windows. we move closer to him until we see his face, and recognize jack woltz. he turns uncomfortably; mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets. something wet. he wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet. he looks at his hand; the wetness is blood. he is frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on his sheets and pajamas. he grunts, pulls the puddle of blood in his bed. he feels his own body frantically, moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face with the great severed head of khartoum lying at the foot of his bed. just blood from the hacked neck. white reedy tendons show. he struggles up to his elbows in the puddle of blood to see more clearly. froth covers the muzzle, and the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered with blood. woltz tries to scream; but cannot. no sound comes out. then, finally and suddenly an ear splitting scream of pure terror escapes from woltz, who is rocking on his hands and knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.}
