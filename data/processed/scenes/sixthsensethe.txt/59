<A>__{malcolm steps into the bathroom quietly. he stares at the silhouette of anna's body through the smoked glass of the shower. anna stands still, her head tilted back. malcolm watches quietly. by his experience, it's clear he's taken by his wife's beauty. malcolm starts towards the shower when his eyes glance to the sink. malcolm locks on a tiny bottle resting on the marble surface. he reaches out and picks it up. the label on the plastic bottle reads,}
