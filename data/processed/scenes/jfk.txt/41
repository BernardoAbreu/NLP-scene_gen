<T>__{time cut to j:}
<A>__{im calling officer habighorst to testify.}
<C>__{garrison}
<D>__{your honor, i call police officer aloysisus habighorst to the stand.}
<A>__{habighorst, the clean cut police officer who booked clay shaw on the day of his arrest, starts forward.}
<C>__{judge haggerty}
<D>__{i'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.}
<C>__{garrison}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{this is an ugly surprise for jim. we see him at the bench arguing loudly with the judge. susie, dymond and al are also there.}
<C>__{judge haggerty}
<D>__{i'm sorry, jim, but the defendant did not have his lawyer present when asked.}
<A>__{flashback to 1967, in the new orleans police station. shaw is being booked. the press is there and habighorst is questioning him.}
<C>__{habighorst}
<D>__{any alias?}
<C>__{shaw}
<D>__{clay bertrand.}
<A>__{we see a close up on habighorst typing this in.}
<C>__{garrison }
<D>__{jesus, ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias. you know that. there's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.}
<C>__{judge haggerty}
<D>__{i call'em as i see'em, jim. i'm ruling it inadmissible.}
<C>__{garrison}
<D>__{that's our case!}
<C>__{judge haggerty}
<D>__{if that's your case, you didn't have a case. i wouldn't believe whatever habighorst said, anyway.}
<C>__{garrison}
<D>__{i can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.}
<C>__{judge haggerty}
<P>__{(feistier)}
<D>__{well, i am saying it. bring in the jury.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{we're filing for a writ to the appellate court.}
<C>__{judge haggerty}
<D>__{you do that.}
<A>__{dymond goes back to shaw, very please. shaw smokes, icy. jim, devastated, sits, feeling it's over.}
