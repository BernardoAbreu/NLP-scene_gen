<C>__{jones }
<D>__{well john... with the funds recovered, i don't think there's going to be any appetite from our side to continue this investigation.}
<A>__{ackerman's shoulders are slumped, staring at demidov's dead body on the ground. jones puts a hand on his back, consoling him.}

<D>__{there's something i don't understand... how did pearce manage to get here and open that safe without anybody noticing? and where did he go?}
<A>__{ackerman stands at the window with his hands behind his back. for the briefest of moments, frank looks back up at him and their eyes connect. frank gives him a little smile. cara takes his arm to climb onto the boat. close on ackerman: his eyes narrow. he knows. for a moment he doesn't move. then, in spite of himself, a small smile creeps over his face too.}
<C>__{ackerman}
<D>__{because pearce was cleverer than all of us.}
