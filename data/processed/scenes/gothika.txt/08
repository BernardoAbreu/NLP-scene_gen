<L>__{interior woodward institute miranda's office evening}
<A>__{stark walls. simple decor. bookshelves packed with the according psychiatric tomes and diplomas. miranda faces a troubled young mess of a woman, chloe: charismatic, deranged and forever trying to provoke. mid session:}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{this is your stepfather who came to visit you?}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{my stepfather? no. he's dead.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i killed him.}
<A>__{miranda tries not to act surprised at this breakthrough. responds with the even keel of a trained psychiatrist.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{that's the first time you admit it.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{so? there's a first time for everything.}
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(jotting this down)}
<D>__{it means you're finally past the denial stage. this is good, chloe.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{i never killed anyone who didn't deserve it.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you only killed your stepfather as far as i know.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{i should've taken care of my mother. she knew all along. you remind me of her.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i remind you of your mother?}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{always so put together. like you iron your underwear. like your pussy is the apricot of the promised land and the bread of the }
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(getting her back on track)}
<D>__{let's get back to your visitor last night.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{the devil.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{alright, the devil. why would the devil visit you? it's already hell in here, what would he have to gain?}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{he came to fuck an angel.}
<P>__{(giggles at that)}
<D>__{i'm his dirty angel.}
<A>__{before miranda can analyze that one, the room lights flicker and die. darkness. miranda's breathing speeds up.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{he grabbed me by the hair while i sucked him and usually i love that, i just do maybe you can tell me why i love it so much but not this time, he was just too rough }
<A>__{as suddenly as it went out, now the power returns. a visibly uncomfortable miranda checks the clock.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{that's it until monday. try and get some sleep tonight, okay?}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{sure, doctor.}
<P>__{(leans in)}
<D>__{crazy people hear messages from god. not the devil. you know that, right?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i didn't say you were crazy.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{you don't have to say it.}
<A>__{she almost doesn't seem crazy when she says this. almost. two orderlies appear at the door. miranda nods for them to escort chloe. chloe shakes their hands away from her, strides off dramatically. the princess of the asylum.}
