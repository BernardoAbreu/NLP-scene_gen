<A>__{the crane swings around with the man in the net. he is emptied out onto the deck like a fish. ahivering on the rotting wooden planks he flips himself over on his stomach. slowly, using the palms of his hands, he drags his trunk and withered limbs across the deck in a labored lobster walk. he uses his chest muscles to swing his legs around the edge of the boat. they dangle like pieces of rope, his feet white and flaccid. a towel, a bottle and a glass are wordlessly placed next to him by a crew person. he pours himself a generous amount of scotch and begins drinking.}

<D>__{too often the great decisions are originated and given form in bodies made up wholly of men...}
<A>__{slowly, she begins to find her voice.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{so that whatever political value women have to offer is shunted aside... without expression. this is a mistake.}
<A>__{she looks up from her cards and stares at the audience... and for the first time speaks spontaneously.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{i think this might be the reason i am having such a difficult time giving voice to my own thoughts here today.}
<A>__{the immediacy of her self effacing comment charms the room.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{i'm reminded of what someone once said about looking at an elephant. that it is impossible to ever see an entire elephant from one place you must walk around it. if our elected leaders are to be truly effective then they must be willing to go out of their way to look beyond what is right in front of them. to see the entire elephant. and for that... they need our help.}

<A>__{eleanor takes one crutch as helena takes the other, replacing it in franklin's hand with a cane. then, with elliot on franklin's left side she bends elliot's arm at a right angle, like a parallel bar, and hooks franklin's left arm around his. going over to franklin's right side she puts a cane in his hand.}

<C>__{eloise}
<D>__{oh, i disagree.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{how can you disagree? "there but for the grace of god goes us," that's what they're saying. as if our bodies is who we are, but it's not. it's our souls is who we are, but they don't know that.}
