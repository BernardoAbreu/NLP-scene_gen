<L>__{exterior blind school day}
<A>__{from a distance, hal seems to be consoling an upset child who's sitting on a rock. but up close...}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{you greedy little bastard. i already gave you a twenty.}
<C>__{blind kid}
<D>__{hey, you want me to play along? then pay up, bitch!}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{fine, but you better be convincing.}
<A>__{he gives the kid a bill out of his wallet and looks over his shoulder to see a hot teacher walking toward them.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{here she comes, go to work.}
<A>__{like a miniature brando, the blind kid buries his face in his hands and begins to cry.}
<C>__{blind kid}
<P>__{(weeping)}
<D>__{why can't i see! why god?}
<A>__{hal puts a warm consoling hand on the weeping boy's shoulder.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{hey, peter. c'mon champ, let me look at you.}
<A>__{the hot teacher stops and curiously watches from a distance. the boy looks up at hal, tears running down his dark sunglasses he should get an oscar.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{you know, in life we're all given no more than we can bear. this happened to you maybe because you were meant to rise above it maybe to be an inspiration to the other little peteys out there.}
<C>__{blind kid}
<D>__{you really think so, hal?}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{hey, does it look like i'm lying? now c'mon, go feel your way to class before you get your little butt suspended.}
<A>__{the boy stands up and is about to take off.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{petey, wait a minute.}
<A>__{hal uses his shirt sleeve to wipe the tears away from the boy's face before sending him on his way. the hot teacher grabs her chest. her heart is about to absolutely melt.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{don't run into anything!}
