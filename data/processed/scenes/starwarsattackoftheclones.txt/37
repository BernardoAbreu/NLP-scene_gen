<L>__{interior naboo palace, throne room afternoon}
<A>__{quen jamillia is seated on the throne, flanked by sio bibble and a couple of advisors. four handmaidens stand close by, and guards are at the doors.}
<C>__{queen jamillia}
<D>__{we've been worried about you.}
<P>__{(takes her hand)}
<D>__{i'm so glad you're safe, padme.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{thank you, your highness. i only wish i could have served you better by staying on coruscant for the vote.}
<C>__{sio bibble}
<D>__{given the circumstances, senator, you know it was the only decision her highness could have made.}
<C>__{queen jamillia}
<D>__{how many systems have joined count dooku and the separatists?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{about two hundred. and more are leaving the republic every day. if the senate votes to create an army, i'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.}
<C>__{sio bibble}
<D>__{it's unthinkable! there hasn't been a full scale war since the formation of the republic!}
<C>__{queen jamillia}
<D>__{do you see any way, through negotiations, to bring the separatists back into the republic?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{not if they feel threatened. the separatists don't have an army, but if they are provoked, they will move to defend themselves. i'm sure of that. and with no time or money to build an army, my guess is they will turn to the commerce guilds or the trade federation for help.}
<C>__{queen jamillia}
<D>__{the armies of commerce! why has nothing been done in the senate to restrain them?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i'm afraid that, despite the chancellor's best efforts, there are still many bureaucrats, judges, and even senators on the payrolls of the guilds.}
<C>__{sio bibble}
<D>__{it's outrageous! after all of those hearings, and the four trials in the supreme court, nute gunray is still the viceroy of the trade federation. do those money mongers control everything?}
<C>__{queen jamillia}
<D>__{remember, counsellor, the courts were able to reduce the federation's armies. that's a move in the right direction.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{there are rumours, your highness, that the federation army was not reduced as they were ordered.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{the jedi have not been allowed to investigate. it would be to be too dangerous for the economy, we were told.}
<C>__{queen jamillia}
<D>__{we must keep our faith in the republic. the day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{let's pray that day never comes.}
<C>__{queen jamillia}
<D>__{in the meantime, we must consider your own safety.}
<A>__{sio bibble signals. all the other advisors and attendants bow and leave the room.}
<C>__{sio bibble}
<P>__{(to anakin)}
<D>__{what is your suggestion, master jedi?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{anakin's not a jedi yet, counsellor. he's still a padawan learner. i was thinking...}
<C>__{anakin}
<P>__{(nettled)}
<D>__{hey, hold on a minute!}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{excuse me! i was thinking i would stay in the lake country. there are some places up there that are very isolated.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{excuse me?! i am in charge of security here, m'lady.}
<A>__{sio bibble and queen jamillia exchange a look. something is going on here.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{annie, my life is at risk, and this is my home. i know it very well... that is why we're here. i think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance.}
<C>__{anakin}
<P>__{(takes a deep breath)}
<D>__{sorry, m'lady.}
<C>__{sio bibble}
<P>__{(to anakin, amused)}
<D>__{she is right. the lake country is the most remote part of naboo. not many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain.}
<C>__{queen jamillia}
<D>__{perfect. it's settled then.}
<A>__{anakin glares at padme. then queen jamillia gets up, and they all start to leave.}
<C>__{queen jamillia}
<P>__{(continued)}
<D>__{padme, i had an audience with your father yesterday. i told him what was happening. he hopes you will visit your mother before you leave... your family's very worried about you.}
<A>__{padme looks worred. they all exit down the main staircase.}
