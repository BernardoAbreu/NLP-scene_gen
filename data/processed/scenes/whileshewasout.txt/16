<A>__{della smiles mysteriously, reaches into the glove compartment with her free hand. she pushes aside a bunch of car papers, a flare, pulls out a check wallet hidden underneath her secret hiding place for: a nice pack of marlboros. she smiles again the smile of the secret smoker. she presses the cigarette lighter into the dashboard. the lighter pops out. she tips out a cigarette, sees a sticky note attached to the interior foil. scrawled in messy handwriting are the words you are supposed to be quitting}
<B>__{della honey. xoxo kenneth.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{i will get right on that kenneth honey. after you stop drinking.}
<A>__{she rips the note off, stuffs it in her purse, lights the cigarette. she inhales deeply. we see the pleasure written across her face.}
