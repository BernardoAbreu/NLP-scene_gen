<L>__{interior seymour's bedroom evening}
<A>__{seymour sits in dim light, dialing an antique "candlestick" telephone. in the background, a peter, paul and mary concert plays on the tv. we hear three rings followed by enid's answering machine message. he hangs up before it finishes. joe walks by the doorway.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, here's where the fun never stops!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{yeah, i'm really, really happy. really having a good time.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{still torturing yourself over that enid, huh?}
<A>__{seymour doesn't answer. he looks away.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{where else am i ever going to find another girl who likes geeshie wiley records?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{she could at least have the decency to call me back.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. who knows? it could be a million things. it's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.}
<A>__{again no answer from seymour, he stares off into space.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{maybe she's got another boyfriend.}
<C>__{seymour}
<P>__{(bummed out, wants joe to stop)}
<D>__{yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{no problem.}
<A>__{seymour looks so miserable that even joe has some compassion for him.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{look at it this way at least things can't get any worse.}
<A>__{joe leaves. seymour is left listening to the record.}
