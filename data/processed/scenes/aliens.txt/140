<A>__{ripley runs to the tactical console where hicks is mesmerized by the images from the surveillance cameras. the flashes of the sentry guns flare out the sensitive video, but impressions of figures moving in the smoky corridor are occasionally visible. the robot sentries hammer away, driving streamers of tracer fire into the swirling mist.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{twenty meters and closing. fifteen. c and d guns down about fifty percent.}
<A>__{the digital readout whirl through descending numbers. an inhuman shrill screeching is audible between bursts of fire.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{now many?}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{can't tell. lots. d gun's down to twenty. ten. it's out.}
<A>__{then the firing from the remaining guns stop abruptly. the video image is a swirling wall of smoke. small fires burn, dim glows in the mist. there are black and twisted shapes, and pieces of twisted shapes, scattered at the edge of visibility. however, nothing emerges from the wall of smoke. the motion sensor tone shuts off.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{they retreated. the guns stopped them.}
<A>__{the moment stretches. everyone exhales slowly.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{yeah. but look...}
<A>__{the digital counters for the two sentry guns read "0" and "10" respectively. less than a second's worth of firing.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{newt time then can walk right up and knock.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{but they don't know that. they're probably looking for other ways to get in. that'll take them awhile.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{maybe we got 'em demoralized.}
<C>__{hicks}
<P>__{(to vasquez and hudson)}
<D>__{i want you two walking the perimeter. i know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. we've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.}
<A>__{the two troopers nod and head for the corridor. ripley sighs and picks up a cup of cold coffee, draining it in one gulp.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{how long since you slept? twenty four hours?}
<A>__{ripley shrugs. she seems soul weary, drained by the nerve wracking tension. when she answers, her voice seems distant, detached.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{they'll get us.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{maybe. maybe not.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{hicks, i'm not going to wind up like those others. you'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{if it comes to that, i will do us both. let's see that it doesn't here, i'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.}
<A>__{he picks up his pulse rifle and with the casually precise movements of long practice he snaps open the bolt, drops out the magazine and hands it to her.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{m 41a 10mm pulse rifle, over and under with a 30mm pump action grenade launcher.}
<A>__{ripley hefts the weapon. it is heavy and awkward. but there is an irrational promise of security in its lethal cold steel lines, to at least the sense that she will be in some greater measure the master of her own fate. she raises it clumsily.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what do i do?}
