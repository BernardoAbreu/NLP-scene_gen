<L>__{interior research and development day}
<A>__{hardly what you'd expect. the lab is hopelessly cluttered, as if a whirlwind had swept inside and thrown everything helter skelter. difford leads nick and alex inside. a man sets in front of a stack on monitors. one his head is a helmet like instrument...sort of an extension of the stereoscopic goggles. he wears a lab coat and a slip stream i.d. badge, but aside from that, his appearance is unkempt. kind of your 60s drop out look.}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{this is one of our newest projects. we're trying to get rid of joy sticks altogether ...}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{the air force is working on the same thing.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(to screen)}
<D>__{come on, come on...}
<A>__{he moves his head this way and that...}
<B>__{the monitors}
<A>__{a computer animated turtle is crawling across the screen. then the words "time's up" flash over. the turtle flips onto it's back and dies, tongue hanging out.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(clearing his throat)}
<D>__{albert...}
<A>__{albert turns around in his seat and pulls off the helmet.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this is nick and alex. they'd like to talk to you about arcade. maybe you can give them a few programmer's secrets.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{yeah, sure.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(to nick and alex)}
<D>__{then i leave you in capable hands.}
<A>__{difford exits. nick points to the helmet in albert's hands.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{does that thing work?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{getting there. it's more sensitive than a joy stick. your video character can respond as fast as you can.}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{but what can i do for you?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{we're having some problems with arcade...}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{yeah, who isn't.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{it's a tough game. hard to pin that bastard down. keeps on changing the rules.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{we vere thinking there might be tricks. you know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{sure. every game's got 'em. i will start with the schematics. i can print these up if you want.}
<A>__{albert moves back to the wall of monitors, then reaches for a computer disk and inserts it into a nearby drive. he taps a few buttons and}
<B>__{bingo... schematics}
<A>__{of each world level within the arcade game appear on the monitors.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{you've got your ten levels, right? here they are... each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.}
<P>__{(points to each one)}
<D>__{first one's the blood red sky, then you've got the blue desert, tower of ghosts, kingdom of the blind... on each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in. if you're too late, the screamer comes.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{how do you stop the screamer?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{you can't. he gets you and you're dead. it's like time catching up with you, you know? like fate. each level you get progressively less time to complete. first half of the game takes place in the wild lands. then you reach level 6, and that's the sea of darkness. there's a two headed boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right. if you don't...}
<A>__{he motions cutting a knife across his throat.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what's the riddle?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{if i tell you, then it's no fun.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(harder)}
<D>__{just tell me the fucking riddle.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{well...it involves a paradox. you have to trick the boatman.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now all the while, you also have to watch your strength. you can build that back up by catching fireflies...the little glowing guys...}
<A>__{albert hits some keys again and levels one through six disappear. now they're replaced by seven through ten. only instead of a schematic for level eleven, there's only a question matc.}
<C>__{albert}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the next half of the game takes place in arcade's brain, the city of truth. it's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. screamer comes faster here. on level four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world. gotta time it right though.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what's the question mark?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{level ten. that's where you've got to unlock arcade's heart using the keys you've found.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{how do you do that?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{good question. see, that's where the fun comes in. arcade changes it every time. he's a machine without a soul. once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.}
<A>__{alex looks dejected.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{but how can it change every time?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{it's the game's logic core. we actually patterned it after human brainwaves. i mean, there's a personality in there. that's what makes it so incredible.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{how the hell did you do that?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{well, we're veering into classified info here, but i will tell you that it involved a donor. he was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.}
<A>__{at this, a chill runs down alex's spine.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{dead?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{well, brain dead anyway. coma patient. it's really not all that important.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{maybe he's not dead.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{he?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{the donor. maybe he's alive inside the game.}
<C>__{albert}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{and maybe you've been taking too many drugs.}
<A>__{nick glances at the helmet again.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{could you play arcade with that?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.}
<A>__{nick nods and smiles, offering his hand.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{thanks, albert. think you could print up those schematics?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{albert moves back to the computer console. meanwhile, nick pulls alex aside.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. and make it quick, okay?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what are you going to do?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{get that helmet. if we're going to play arcade, i want every advantage possible.}
<A>__{across the lab, albert is oblivious to their conversation. alex backs towards the lab doors, turns, and opens them.}
