<L>__{interior phone booth}
<B>__{angle on dangling receiver}
<A>__{as it sways back and forth. from it, we hear the voice.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{thanks for such an interesting afternoon.}
<B>__{then there are other sounds emanating from the dangling swaying phone.}
<A>__{a wooden door being battered open. a few incomprehensible shouts as a swat team dashes in. stu's stalling for time has paid off.}
<B>__{the sound of a barrage of gunfire. the sound of a muffled scream.}
<A>__{the police have broken in on stu's tormentor and there has been a rapid exchange of shots. a hand reaches into the booth and grabs the receiver. angle widens as ramey places it to his ear.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{hello? this is captain ramey. somebody talk to me.}
<C>__{swat officer's voice}
<D>__{yeah. we took him out, captain. nobody else got hurt.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{what's his condition?}
<C>__{swat officer's voice}
<D>__{critical. the sonofabitch took two. probably won't survive the ride.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{get a statement from him. i will be right over.}
<A>__{he drops the receiver so that it dangles again. camera follows ramey to where stu lies surrounded by cops and medics. he's stunned, but very much alive.}
<C>__{medic}
<D>__{don't try to sit up.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{ramey}
<P>__{(kneeling)}
<D>__{rubber bullet.}
<C>__{medic}
<D>__{you'll have one hell of a nasty welt. busted rib. maybe a permanent scar there.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{it couldn't hurt much more if you really shot me.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{somebody was going to and we thought it may as well be us.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{did you get him?}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{sure as hell did. thanks to you.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{still alive?}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{barely.}
<C>__{medic}
<D>__{we'll be giving him a hypo for the pain. it'll put him out for a while.}
<A>__{kelly is now brought over by a female cop. she drops to her knees beside stu and tries to embrace him. the medics restrain her.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{it's okay. i'm not really shot.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i was so afraid. i thought...}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i thought so, too. but we're going to be alright. both of us.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{remember how you swore up and down you'd get me on tv? well, you did. i already got interviewed on fox and channel eleven and they even want me on a.m. america tomorrow morning.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{bet you didn't think i could deliver on that.}
<C>__{medic}
<D>__{will you please let go of him, miss?}
<A>__{a gurney is wheeled over from a police ambulance. the medic is about to administer the hypo but stu pushes him away.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{no. no hypo. i want to see him first.}
<A>__{the medics are now ready to lift stu onto the gurney and cart him off. but stu struggles against them.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{relax. the guy's dying.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{that's why i've gotta talk to him. please!}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{we'll see.}
<C>__{medic}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{you can ride with him in the ambulance.}
<A>__{the woman cop escorts kelly to the waiting ambulance. ramey meanwhile tries to resume contact with the swat team inside the hotel.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{this is ramey. over. this is ramey. ten four.}
<A>__{there's nothing but static, mixed up feedback and multiple garbled voices on the other end of the line.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{shit. get everybody off this wavelength.}
<A>__{he crosses back to the phone booth picks up the dangling receiver.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{hello. hello! pick up! yeah, it's ramey again. can you hold the phone close enough so the perp can listen?}
<C>__{cop's voice}
<D>__{he's not saying a word, captain.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{he's not about to talk to us. maybe to him.}
<A>__{ramey looks back to where the medics are still trying to lift stu onto the gurney.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{forget that. stand him up.}
<P>__{(to stu)}
<D>__{can you stand?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i can try.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{help him over here.}
<A>__{the medics support stu and inch him back to the booth. it's painful, but stu ignores it. ramey holds the phone up so stu can both listen and speak.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{here. speak up.}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(into pay phone)}
<D>__{it's me. do you hear me? answer me.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(wheezing)}
<D>__{had to have the last word, stu.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i finally beat your ass. admit it, you fuck.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{but you'll never forget me. i gave you the most thrilling day of your life. say thanks.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{now you're gonna die, you bastard.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i lost a lot of blood. don't you want to donate some for me? then we'd really be part of each other.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{hang on. i can't wait to see you at the hospital. so i can yank your fucking air tube out.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{wish i could give you that pleasure. you deserve it.}
<P>__{(coughing)}
<D>__{... only i'm out of time.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{what's your name? at least tell me who you are.}
<A>__{there's more violent coughing, then silence. then a cop's voice is heard.}
<C>__{cop's voice}
<D>__{he's gone.}
<A>__{stu stares at the receiver.}
<C>__{ramey}
<D>__{don't worry. we'll find out who he is. and why he picked you.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{no. you won't.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{what do you want to bet you won't?}
<A>__{stu reaches over and hangs up the receiver. click.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i will spend my whole life trying to figure that out.}
<A>__{then he sinks into the arms of the medics who lower him onto the waiting gurney. the hypo is finally administered. it kicks in immediately, relieving the pain. he's wheeled away from the booth to the waiting ambulance. kelly is already inside waiting to accompany stu to the hospital. stu's pov being wheeled away from the empty booth pulling away in low angle. camera slides back inside the ambulance with stu. the doors shut, obliterating our view of the phone booth that was his entire world until moments ago.}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(groggy)}
<D>__{gotta sleep now. no phone calls...}
<A>__{kelly smiles down at him as the image blurs. stu passes out into a deep sleep he much deserves.}
<B>__{a siren blares.}
