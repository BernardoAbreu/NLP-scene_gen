<L>__{interior barracks night the recruits}
<A>__{have some free time. johnny makes a big show of polishing the chevrons that designate him as squad leader.}
<C>__{kitten smith}
<D>__{look at him. do you think anyone has ever been so pleased with himself ?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{zim hadda choose someone to be his brown nose, i guess.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{i just want you guys to know that i will never do anything that i haven't asked you to do first.}
<A>__{johnny approaches dizzy.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{couldn't've done it without you, diz. friends ?}
<A>__{dizzy smiles, shakes.}
<C>__{dizzy}
<D>__{yeah, sure... friends.}
<A>__{bronski walks through with the mail.}
<C>__{bronski}
<D>__{levy... shujumi... rico.}
<A>__{johnny grabs the e disk, pops it into his handcam. the fleet mail logo appears:}
<B>__{approved message}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{bet it's from my girl.}
<A>__{johnny's pals gather for a look. carmen appears, dressed down to skivvies, in her quarters aboard starship athena.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{hi, johnny, i would've written sooner, but they've really got us going every moment here.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{yeow, rico, you don't deserve that !}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{shhhh...!}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{i'm glad you're doing so well. if they haven't made you squad leader by now, i'm sure you will.}
<A>__{johnny holds up his squad leader chevrons victoriously.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{all it takes is the love of a good woman...}
<A>__{the image changes abrupltly. now carmen's wearing a trim blue flight suit. she stands the camera on athena's gunnery deck. outside , the rings of saturn sparkle in bright solar light.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{look at that. isn't it beautiful ? i had to show you. it's great to be out here on my own. i'm just not some little girl from buenos aires anymore. i'm gonna be a starship pilot, and i'm gonna see the universe...}
<P>__{(she sighs)}
<D>__{and that's also the problem because i don't really want to get married, johnny. i don't want to have kids. i want a command, a ship of my own, and you know, i don't think that's gonna leave a lot of room for you and me.}
<A>__{johnny is stunned. all the other recruits suddenly seem to have something else to do.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{i know that's not what you wanted to hear... but i have to follow my heart. i'm sorry. i'm afraid you'll hate me, and i couldn't stand that. write me, alright ? write me, so i will know that we'll always be friends.}
<A>__{the fleet mail logo appears again: end of message. johnny shuts the handcam off. ace puts a hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{it's what i deserve.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{whad'ya talkin about ?}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{i joined up for her. i wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. i'm a fool.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{you made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.}
<A>__{johnny smiles in spite of himself.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{thanks, ace.}
<A>__{johnny turns for the door, flipping the chevrons like a coin. dizzy watches him leave. she'd so like to comfort him.}
