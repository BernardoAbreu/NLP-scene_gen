<L>__{16. when he chambers it, it sounds like thunder cracking.}
<A>__{the plume draws closer and closer until it's not just a plume, but two dots. then it's two jeep like vehicles. next we can even make out the passengers. that doesn't do much to relax our boys. us, the iraqis, we're almost on top of each other now. the vehicles are going to pass within feet. epps throws in one more thing:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{wave at them. don't look, just wave.}
<A>__{all three throw up some weak, forced waves. the vehicles pass. look at that: the iraqis are waving back. and that's all they're doing, just waving. our boys break out into cheers.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah! yeah!}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i think i'm going to throw up. i am. i'm going to toss.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{you see that? right by us. they went right by. you had them epps; you called it.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{look at you, not even breaking a sweat. you're cool, boy. you're cool.}
<A>__{they all have a good laugh, but wes brings that to a crashing halt. looking back at the iraqis, in a voice dead with fear:}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{they stopped.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{wha...}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{oh, jesus, they've stopped.}
<A>__{epps and jaeger look behind them.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{they stopped, and they've turned around.}
<A>__{the two iraqi vehicles have stopped, they've turned, and now they're racing towards our boys. epps momentarily freezes. jaeger helps him right out of it.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{go, go, go!}
<A>__{epps punches it, and the hummer takes off. the iraqis are right behind them. the vehicles all do same hard driving: they twist and turn like wild snakes over the loose sand; hit dunes, take flight... it's the open desert, and our boys have nowhere to hide. inside the hummer it's a rough, rough ride. our boys are thrown violently about the cabin. for epps controlling the hummer is about as easy as riding a wild horse. the iraqis turn things up a notch and start sending gunfire our way. bullets kick up around the hummer like angry, little bees with a hell of a sting. epps yells at jaeger.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{shoot them!}
<A>__{now it's jaeger who's freezes. epps returns the favor.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{shoot 'em!}
<A>__{jaeger climbs back to the humvee's machine gun, works the action and starts firing. unlike before when he was playing, the real thing is much wilder. the humvee bounces around like a cork in the ocean. taking aim is nearly impossible. the best jaeger can do is squeeze off rounds in the iraqis' general direction. all wes can do is cover his head, and stay down like a scared little girl.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{steady it out!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!}
<A>__{it's like a dog fight in the dirt. the vehicles weave, cut... one of the iraqis starts to cut across jaeger's firing line. jaeger swings the machine gun around hard and lets loose. a hail of bullets rips into the iraqi vehicle just above wheel level. it kicks the vehicle up and back, whipping and twisting it horribly in the air time after time, then smashing it back into the ground. jaeger is beside himself.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i got him! you see that, i nailed him!}
<A>__{as if in answer the remaining iraqi vehicle's gunner tears off a salvo that eats up the space right around jaeger. he's not hit, but it kicks him back down into the humvee screaming with fear.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{damn it!}
<A>__{the boys are running out of options, and epps knows it.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{wes, take the wheel.}
<A>__{no good. wes is too scared to move. epps reaches back and literally pulls him up and over into the front.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{take it!}
<A>__{with little finesse wes takes the wheel as epps slides over. epps takes up an m 16 with a grenade launcher. he loads it up, and readies the weapon. crawling to the back he takes aim.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{keep it steady.}
<A>__{wes does his best to give a level ride, but the iraqi bullets coming at them don't help much. epps zeroes in on the target. he takes aim and starts to squeeze back on the trigger. he almost has a shot off when wes hits a dune rocking the hummer violently. epps loses the target.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{damn it! i said keep it steady.}
<A>__{epps tries to take aim again. careful aim. one shot is all he gets. the bullets keep coming, but he's in no hurry. waiting...waiting... the iraqis are only getting closer.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{shoot...shoot!}
<A>__{waiting... closer...}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{shoot!}
<A>__{epps fires! the grenade rips from the launcher, riding a trail of white smoke, and slams into the iraqis. you know the story: huge explosion, car parts flying a hundred feet into the air, bodies whipping through space, stuff bob dole would hate. but maybe he would like it. they were just iraqis. wes brings the hummer to a halt. a spastic, scared, relieved laugh escapes him. jaeger, checking himself for wounds, and epps, m 16 still in hand, get out. epps makes his way to the wreckage, sweeping it with his rifle ready to blast any survivors. yeah, like somebody's walking away from that bang. wes finally makes his way over to the others who stand and stare at the burning hulk of whatever it was.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i thought we were dead.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah, well, we're not.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{we got to get out of here.}
<A>__{nobody says anything. this really scares wes.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{we have to go back.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{we're not going anywhere. not 'til we get what we came for.}
<C>__{wes}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{we just about got killed. you know what happened? we just about got killed, and you want to go on?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{jaeger, go check out the hummer for damage.}
<A>__{jaeger starts to cross back to the hummer. wes gives him something to take with him.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you're crazy, you know that? you're insane!}
<A>__{jaeger goes leaving epps and wes all by their lonesome. wes turns to epps.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you know that, right? you know he's sick?}
<A>__{with a flip of his head epps indicates the dead iraqis.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{they shouldn't have been here.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{we shouldn't have been here, epps. there is a war going on!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{this is miles from the battle lines. they were probably deserters.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{they shouldn't have been out this way, that's all i'm saying.}
<A>__{wes starts to get it. it really doesn't matter what he has to say.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{we're not going back, are we?}
<A>__{epps has got nothing to say to the truth. he turns and starts to walk to the hummer.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you bastard! you're trying to get us killed.}
<A>__{like a whip epps snaps around. he grabs up wes and pulls him close.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i'm trying to get us paid. i'm trying to get us all paid! as long as there's a chance something is out there we go on. there's not going to be anymore trouble. if there is, we go back, but there won't be.}
<A>__{almost as an afterthought epps realizes he's got wes, and lets him go. gently he puts it:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you'll feel different after we find the treasure. money has away of making people feel different.}
<A>__{nobody's got anytbing to say to that, so they say nothing. epps heads back to the hummer. a beat later wes follows. jaeger is already behind the wheel. epps rides shotgun this time. once again wes is in back. to jaeger, epps ask:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{she okay?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah. yeah, she's fine.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{jaeger fires it up, and pulls out. as they head off we:}
