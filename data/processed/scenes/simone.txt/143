<A>__{a figure sits at viktor's computer. lainey. she scrolls through viktor's files. all empty. lainey sighs. elaine paces behind her.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{let's go, lainey. there's nothing here.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{just a minute.}
<A>__{elaine continues to pace as lainey works.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{god, it's so like your father. why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore? i can almost forgive him for killing simone but denying her existence. i can never forgive that.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{because obviously she existed, right?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart. she was the most vital woman i ever met.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{so you did meet her?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{of course. what are you suggesting?}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{i mean really meet her in the flesh.}
<A>__{elaine regards her daughter curiously.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{i know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when i think about it honestly, i haven't. i mean, it feels like i have. i know more about her than members of my own family. she's even in my dreams. but i realized, going back through my diary, they were all tv appearances, near misses at parties, second hand rumor, gossip on the internet. i've never actually seen simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence. have you?}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(unable to refute it)}
<D>__{well, i }
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{ we don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(trying to shake the notion from her head)}
<D>__{lainey, there's no evidence that simone isn't real.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{listen to what you're saying, mom. is there any evidence she is?}
<A>__{lainey finally tries another file. she presses "eject". the "plague" disc spits out of the machine.}
<C>__{lainey}
<P>__{(regarding the disc)}
<D>__{there's one part of dad's story that may have been true. simone may have contracted a virus.}
<A>__{lainey smiles at her mother.}
<C>__{lainey}
<D>__{certain viruses can be cured.}
