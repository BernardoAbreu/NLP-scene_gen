<A>__{old philadelphia awakens... for a moment, it's like we're back in time. a golden sun dances on the waters of penns landing. historical old ships sit docked in its harbor... the dark bronze surface of the liberty bell reflects the dawn... a majestic independence hall stands watch as its city begins to stir... a thirty foot statue of ben franklin makes a proud silhouette against the morning sky... and then 1997 comes crashing in. fluorescent house lights come on in windows... jeeps and hatchbacks start roaming the cobblestone streets... neon restaurants signs flicker to life... traffic helicopters make their rounds... car alarms pierce the air.}
