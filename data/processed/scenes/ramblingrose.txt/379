<L>__{interior dr. martinson's some office night}
<T>__{cut to :}
<A>__{a shot of dr. martinson's private office in his home, quite a bit more luxurious than his office at the hospital. a sober looking mother and daddy sit talking to him. he almost seems to relish the situation.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{i'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. an ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. but it was pure wishful thinking on her part. the girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(shocked, rather feebly)}
<D>__{gonorrhea?}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{don't worry, madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. she long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. the girl is permanently barren.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{well, that's pathetic. poor rose, what a life she has had.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{we make our own lives, madam. as for malignancy, i don't think so, it's very unlikely. i probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(rather coldly, seems disenchanted with him)}
<D>__{no, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. she thinks she has cancer and is going to die.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{she's an adult, mrs. hillyer, i was merely giving her the facts.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{well, it's a disaster. i don't know what to say, doctor, i am floored. how dangerous is the operation?}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{any major operation is dangerous. however, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. she doesn't even know who the father might have been.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. a fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. it's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason i want to mention to you.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(totally disenchanted with the doctor)}
<D>__{this conversation is making me a little sick.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{honey, that's no way to talk to the doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.}
<A>__{oddly enough, in the stress of the situation, daddy now seems almost friendly to dr. martinson, whom previously he considered a polecat.}
