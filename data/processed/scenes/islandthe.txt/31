<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{his name is starkweather two delta. he dropped off the ether two days ago. at first we thought it was a system error. then we found this in a garbage chute.}
<A>__{he opens a drawer and pulls out an ethercuff. he hands it to scheer who considers it remotely for a few seconds. then }

<D>__{d e l t a generation, huh?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{scheer}

<C>__{merrick}

<D>__{what happened to this one?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{we don't know. he just disappeared.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{n o t easy to disappear. unless he figured a way through the boundary.}
<C>__{merrick}

<D>__{i f you bothered to read the clone laws, you'd realize we have no choice in the matter. the virtual humanity statutes accord them a set of freedoms. all we can do is prescribe the limits. and even those are subject to regulation. scope of knowledge, range of activity, even their speech patterns. the law requires that what is of human origin be provided with human characteristics.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{you mean, like fallibility?}
<A>__{merrick pauses. he's not going to take the bait.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{the ether shows no attempts on the boundary. he's here, karl. but for some reason, your men seem unable to find him. it's your job to contain the products. i'd like you to do it, okay?}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{a little sensitive, aren't we?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{j u s t after starkweather went missing, his sponsor placed an order. an order we can't fill. damn right i'm sensitive.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{a l r i g h t . how much time do i have?}
<A>__{merrick taps a button. a holoframe appears beside the proxy. even in two dimensions, the face is identical. just a different hairstyle and a gold earring. this is the face of the sponsor.}
