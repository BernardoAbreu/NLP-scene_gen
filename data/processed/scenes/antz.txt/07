<L>__{interior ant bar night}
<A>__{a long bar filled with ants. the bar itself seems to stretch for miles, and there are hundreds of ants trying to get a drink...unfortunately, there's only one bartender. z is at the bar with weaver, a burly ant soldier.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{we declared war again?}
<P>__{(off weaver's nod)}
<D>__{are you scared?}
<C>__{weaver}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i will be back.}
<A>__{the bartender, a grizzled veteran, slaps down what looks like a couple of large green beer mugs. actually, they're aphids, little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs hanging from the ceiling. the kegs are specialized ants with hugely distended stomachs, which spray liquid into the aphids.}
<C>__{aphids}
<P>__{(as they're slapped on bar)}
<D>__{ouch! ouch!}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{two aphid beers.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(as bartender leaves)}
<D>__{did you see that? how he gave you the beers, not me? i'm telling you, he's got something against workers.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about, z.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{come on everybody dumps on us workers. you soldiers get all the glory. plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.}
<A>__{we can see that weaver is eyeing a nearby table of "worker babes", including z's friend azteca.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{weaver, they're career girls. they're obsessed with digging.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{no, i will probably never meet the girl for me.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{who said there was a girl for you? i was talking about a girl for me.}
<P>__{(quaffing his aphid beer)}
<D>__{don't you want your aphid beer?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{i can't help it. i have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature. call me crazy.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{z, we've known each other a long time, right?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{of course. you were born two seconds after me.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{and all the time i've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. you should quit making waves. go with the flow.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{weaver, i'm an insect, not a liquid.}
<A>__{down the bar, there's a commotion. a grizzled old scout ant has had too much to drink.}
<C>__{drunk scout}
<D>__{have you been to insectopia? haveyou? no, ya goddam larvas! but i have...}
<P>__{(becoming emotional)}
<D>__{...mosquitos n' caterpillars n' beetles all livin' in peace, stuffin their guts with food...no rules, no regulations...you can be your own ant there...}
<P>__{(howling drunkenly)}
<D>__{it's insectopia! insectopia!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{hey, weaver, listen!}
<C>__{drunk scout}
<D>__{i was cut off from my unit found it by mistake }
<P>__{(slurring)}
<D>__{it changed my life!}
<P>__{(spraying another soldier with saliva)}
<D>__{you see ya follow the great yellow egg, and you come to the land of red and white }
<C>__{soldiers}
<D>__{you've had enough for one night! come on, gramps, before you get in trouble.}
<A>__{the soldiers pull him from the bar, carrying him out.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{hey, did you hear what he said?!}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.}
<B>__{music starts up.}
