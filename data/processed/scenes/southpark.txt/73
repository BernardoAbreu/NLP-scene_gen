<D>__{do not be afraid of this war. instead embrace it. we have god on our side. and besides, they're just canadians, what the hell are they gonna do?}
<L>__{interior gymnasium day}
<A>__{everyone watches the television in stunned silence.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{chef, what does it mean that we're at war?}
<C>__{chef}
<D>__{it's... it's not good children.}
<C>__{principal victoria}
<D>__{what do we do? do we go on as normal or...?}
<C>__{mr. garrison}
<D>__{i don't know principal victoria... i don't know...}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{and now, i would like to bring up the woman who led, and is still leading the way in this glorious stand }
<C>__{kyle}
<P>__{(pointing to tv)}
<D>__{holy shit dude!!}
<A>__{kyle's mom appears on the tv dressed in military garb.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{mrs. sheila brovlofski.}
<C>__{chef}
<D>__{isn't that your mother, kyle?}
<A>__{kyle can't believe it. on the television, kyle's mother walks up to the podium. she is dressed to the hilt. she hugs the president and the first lady and then takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{kyle's mother}
<D>__{my fellow americans. i have led this fight in the war against profanity. i have founded mothers against canada. our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{as commander in chief, i have ordered our army to set up defensive positions along the us canada border in anticipation of an attack.}
<C>__{kyle's mother}
<D>__{what about air strikes?}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{kyle's mother}
<D>__{we have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers. it's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach american soil!}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{oh, uh... i don't know if air strikes are necessary.}
<C>__{kyle's mother}
<D>__{not necessary?! mr. president, may i remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! the bastard canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. well, if it is war they want... then war they shall have!!!}
<A>__{a huge eruption of cheers from the crowd in front of kyle's mother. she is obviously floored by it. she can't help but smile. she actually holds her head up higher, and then raises her arms up in two peace signs, as the cheers get louder. the president forces a smile and actually applauds with the rest of the crowd. back in the gymnasium, kyle looks thoroughly embarrassed.}
<C>__{chef}
<D>__{damn, your mom's a bitch, kyle.}
<C>__{cartman}
<D>__{amen to that.}
