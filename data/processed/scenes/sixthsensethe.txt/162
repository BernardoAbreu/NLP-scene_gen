<A>__{the crowd watches in riveted silence. the father never takes his eyes off of the screen. the image of the mother prepares the meal. she uncovers the fruit and the soup. places a straw into the drink. and then it happens. the image of the mother walks to a closet. opens it. an assortment of household cleaners and sponges are kept inside. she pulls out a bottle of floor cleaner. reads the label for the ingredients. walks back to the food tray, where she unscrews the cap on the floor cleaner. the mother pours some into the cap. checks it.}
