<A>__{the room is crowded with homeless men and women and a few children. in the back we find maurice. in his old clothes, and tired disheveled appearance maurice is virtually invisible in this crowd. he presses something to his injured side. his condition has worsened. he eyes the entrance where a police officer walks in and moves to the serving counter. the officer asks the serving lady something, and shows her a picture. she shrugs her shoulders and continues serving. the cop takes one last look around the hundreds of hungry people leaving the room. maurice pulls up his hand from underneath his shirt. the napkin he was holding at his side is saturated with blood. maurice replaces it with a clean napkin.}
