<A>__{muldoon and arnold run across the lawn. muldoon carries his rocket launcher at a ready position. in the distance, the alarm still sounds, lights flash a continued warning. they reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed. its familiar him has been replaced by its own alarms. the closer they approach, the louder and brighter these alarms are. grey steam pours out of the vents of the building, obscuring everything.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{what's that steam coming out of my generator room?}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{relax, it's just refrigerated air. there's a leaky cooling pipe. i fixed it a couple times before but the original installation was at too sharp an angle.}
<A>__{arnold accepts this. he is about to enter when muldoon instructs him.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{just go and turn on your generator, then get right back to the control room.}
<A>__{arnold lights a cigarette and disappears into the steam shrouded door.}
