<L>__{exterior crossroads day}
<A>__{arrows point in opposite directions to venice and berlin. the camera moves in on the portion of the sign reading berlin.}
<L>__{exterior city square berlin night}
<A>__{a nazi rallya book burning is in process. the mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by the minute as college students and nazi brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire. flags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically from side to side in a motion that echoes the mounting frenzy of the enormous crowd. indy and henry walk toward the square. indy wears the uniform of a nazi soldier. he is now buttoning up the tunicwhich happens to be several sizes too big.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{my boy, we are pilgrims in an unholy land.}
<A>__{then... indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks. we pan along his line of sight to:}
<B>__{the podium}
<A>__{where high ranking officers of the third reich stand flanking adolf hitler as they oversee the rally.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{elsa is walking away in an open area, background of torches, vehicles, nazi officers... one of whom is now none other than indy, coming up to her before she knows he is there. his voice is quiet and tough, his eyes hard.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{fraulein doctor. where is it?}
<A>__{still startled, her reaction makes it clear that indy is even now a lover in her thoughts.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{how did you get here?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{where is it? i want it.}
<A>__{indy pushes elsa against a column and begins to search her clothing for the diary. he pulls the book from elsa's pocket.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{you came back for the book? whv?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{my father didn't want it incinerated.}
<A>__{she understands him. it's as though he slapped her.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{is that what you think of me? i believe in the grail, not the swastika.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(vicious)}
<D>__{yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the grail stands forwho gives a damn what you think?}
<C>__{elsa}
<P>__{(hard and fast)}
<D>__{you do.}
<A>__{now it's as though she'd slapped him back. his hands fly to her neck.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{all i have to do is squeeze.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{all i have to do is scream.}
<A>__{it's a standoff emotionally. he knows he'd never do it. she knows it too. and the same goes for screaming. indy releases her and backs away. she looks at him with a lover's pain. he moves over to henry.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i've got it. let's get the hell out of here.}
<A>__{they move off and almost run headlong into hitler and his entire entourage coming down from the podium. 50 kids push their autograph books for hitler's signature. hitler pauses to sign them. hitler looks indy's way. they make eye contact. it only lasts a moment but the moment is electric. hitler breaks the spell by taking the grail diary from him, opens it to the first page and signs his autograph. he hands it back and moves on.}
