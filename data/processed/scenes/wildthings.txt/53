<L>__{exterior the strip mall day}
<A>__{dazzling light. sam's smashed up jeep is parked before ken bowden's office, next door to the mongolian beef bowl.}
<L>__{interior beef bowl same}
<A>__{sam and ken eye one another over a green plastic table ken with his neck brace, sam with a bruised face.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{i figured, you know, it would be darker in here.}
<A>__{he moves a hand to his face.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{good thinking.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{you can tie whoever did it to sandra van ryan...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{forget it.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{lady has some deep pockets. that's all i'm saying.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i know how deep her pockets are, ken. i thought i might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?}
<A>__{he pauses to look at ken bowden.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{can't you take that stupid thing off?}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{not in here. chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.}
<A>__{san sighs, slumps back in his plastic seat.}
<C>__{ken }
<D>__{you're not in bad shape, really. i know you think you are, but you're not. let me tell you why.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sandra van ryan.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{for you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... it doesn't add up. sandra van ryan's got 'em running scared.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i will tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.}
<A>__{ken reaches into his briefcase. he pulls out some papers, tosses them on the table. sam picks one up, starts to read.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{nellie gail ranch...}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{sound nice? it's a fucking drug rehab farm. it's where kelly van ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{meanwhile, you get educator of the year i mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet. reason? they're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty. now tell me i'm right.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{there's nothing for them to get.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{good. so what we're going to do is march right to hunter's doorstep. we're going to insist they take a statement. we're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they're walking a fine line here. defamation of character, malicious prosecution...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i just want my life back...}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{fair enough. let's go make a statement.}
