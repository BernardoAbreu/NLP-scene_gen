<A>__{we pan up a modern office building. the camera reaches the top of the building and we see a giant starbucks logo and the words: starbucks world headquarters.}
<L>__{interior starbucks board room}
<A>__{the penthouse boardroom is adorned with starbucks paraphernalia: large logo, clear canisters full of beans, and a large world map with a little logo everywhere there is a starbucks. around a large table are dr. evil, number two (bandaged and lightly spotted with soot), frau, scott and a couple of new henchmen. a starbucks employee serves everyone steaming hot coffee products.}

<D>__{oh good, number two, i do enjoy a good cuppa joe.}
