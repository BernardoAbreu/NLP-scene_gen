<A>__{coffey pulls the trigger... click. bud flinches, then opens his eyes, staring cross eyed at the muzzle of the .45. coffey cocks it and tries again. click. nothing. really pissed off beyond description, bud hurls the commando off him with a powerful heave, sending him clattering against a rack of equipment. they face off, panting.}

<A>__{even so bud is getting his ass kicked. coffey's really trying to put him out of business. it's mostly duck and dodges on bud's part. throw a few things. when coffey connects, bud goes down hard. give him credit, though. he manages to scramble back up. the fight wrecks the room, scattering tools and gear. compressed air cylinders roll dangerously around the floor. coffey slips on one and buds get in a couple of good licks. slams the seal's head in an equipment locker door. but the navy man is just too massive. bud is hammered back into a wall. coffey has his fist cocked back for the coup de grace. spins around at the sound of a voice.}

<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{catfish is right behind him. dripping wet. a trail of water goes back to the moonpool a few feet away. crack! catfish's 'hammer' punch comes in so hard and so fast, coffey is knocked right on his ass. he doesn't get up. just sort of flops around. catfish helps bud to his feet. they advance on coffey, who crab scuttles sideways, his eyes rabid. he picks up a helium tank and hurls it at them. as they duck he sprints to flatbed and drops through the hatch and slams it down.}

<D>__{get the door!}
<A>__{bud leaps across the water to land on flatbed. the hatch is already sealed. he grapples with geek mirv, trying to free it from the steel claw.}
