<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{time to go.}
<A>__{katherine hesitates, part of her unwilling to let the baby go. then she plants a lingering kiss on his downy hair and lets ester take him. lincoln presents her with the data tablet }

<D>__{you'll make sure this gets out?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{yes . there are people sympathetic to the cause. i'm going to get it to them.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{thank you, katherine. for everything.}
