<D>__{well, the way she's teachin' it has got everything switched around. i was on the textbook committee, and her version is not }
<C>__{principal}
<D>__{we think of the textbook as kind of a guide, not an absolute }
<C>__{anglo mother}

<D>__{just adding a little historical perspective }
<B>__{rear of auditorium}
<A>__{paloma cruz, pilar's teenage daughter, peeks into the room, then moves down the side toward the stage.}
<C>__{anglo father}
<D>__{you may call it history, but i call it propaganda. i'm sure they got their own account of the alamo on the other side, but we're not on the other side, so we're not about to have it taught in our schools!}
