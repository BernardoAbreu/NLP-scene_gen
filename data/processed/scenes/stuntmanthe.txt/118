<A>__{on the portable screen, raymond in helmet and goggles is in the cockpit of an airplane. he stuffs a bottle of champagne into a leather flying boot, dangles the package over the side and lets it go. raymond looks down and salutes (like that famous scene in "wings").}

<D>__{who says nothin' changes? like to see one of our boys in a b 52 try that.}
<A>__{eli's voice yells 'cut' on the sound track. the angle on the portable screen widens and we see that the airplane sits on the ground with an electric fan blowing wind in raymond's face. now the scene on the portable screen changes: from the ground, we see the same biplane flying low. an object drops from the cockpit (the boot). then there is a burst of flame in the engine. trailing smoke, the plane wobbles, crash lands (sliding alarmingly close to camera). it ground loops, goes up on one wing and, as it crashes down, we see that the pilot who we assumed was raymond, is really a dummy that is flapping absurdly and falling to pieces before our eyes during the crash. there are groans, laughter and raspberries}
