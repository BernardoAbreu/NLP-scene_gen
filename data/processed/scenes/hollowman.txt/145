<A>__{mrs. kramer retreats back to her bedroom as dr. kramer crosses over to the telephone. he picks up the receiver and starts dialing. in the middle of dialing, the phone goes dead. he clicks the hookswitch up and down trying to get a dial tone. nothing. he checks the connections on the phone and then follows the wiring to the wall. the line's plugged in. weird. he hears a door creak open in the kitchen.}
<C>__{kramer }
<D>__{hello? hello?}
<A>__{kramer crosses to the darkened kitchen. the kitchen door leading to the backyard is open. puzzled, he crosses to it. a wind stirs across the pool and backyard, swirling dead leaves in small twists of wind. the windchime rings lightly. kramer steps out.}
