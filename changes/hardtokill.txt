In the other, Storm unfolds a pouch containing an assortment of needles: long, short, skinny, fat. Storm fingers the needles and finds a spot in his shoulder with very bad scar tissue and quickly and coldly sticks it in deep. He then twirls and adjusts it. It is apparent that he knows what he's doing. We STAY CLOSE ON the needles, noting the amount in the package has greatly diminished. PULL UP to reveal Storm, with at least 50 needles sticking out of him. He is now frozen deep in meditation. CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND him 360 DEGREES -- he is like a Japanese statue.}

When it's deep enough, he places the boards down into the hole and begins to fill it in, packing the earth tightly. He goes to the top of the boards and around them wraps a length of old hemp rope. Around and around. The boards stand up about six feet high. Storm steps back, observes the height, taps it lightly testing the recoil tension. Now he begins to punch it, harder and harder. Over and over again. Andy, preparing his lunch, can't keep her eyes off him. She is awed by his fire and perseverance. G)    EXT.
