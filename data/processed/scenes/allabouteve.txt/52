<L>__{interior richards' bedroom night}
<A>__{it is a lovely, large room. two double beds, not alongside each other and each with an extension phone beside it. in addition to the door to the living room, there are two more to separate dressing rooms and baths. lloyd is asleep. but not karen. she turns restlessly, finally sits up, lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{karen's voice}
<D>__{it seemed to me i had known always that it would happen and here it was. it felt helpless, that helplessness you feel when you have no talent to offer outside of loving your husband. how could i compete? everything lloyd loved about me, he had gotten used to long ago...}
<A>__{the phone jangles suddenly, startling her. it wakes lloyd up. karen answers.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{hello... who?... who's calling mr. richards?}
