<A>__{strolling now. elias elated, uncontained joy.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{we did it. twenty million. twenty fucking million. we're going to have synthetics. we're gonna be rich. we're gonna...}
<A>__{hull stops walking and just stands there.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what's the matter, john? be happy. your whole life has just been solved.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(behind them)}
<D>__{stop! police!}
<A>__{in one motion, elias draws his gun, turns and fires. the figure goes down. elias can't believe he hit him. hull starts toward the figure.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(heading the other way)}
<D>__{john, where are you going?}
<A>__{taft on the ground.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{oh, jesus, no...}
<A>__{he drops to his knees. blood oozes from taft's chest.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{john, what the hell are you doing? let's get out of here.}
<A>__{hull tries to hold closed the wound. the posture duplicates hull with his dying father. he feels for a pulse. for breath.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(distraught)}
<D>__{he's dying.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{let him die. let him die twice. come one.}
<A>__{he pulls at hull who won't go. hull does mouth to mouth. taft opens his eyes, looks up at him.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{[says to taft whatever a cpr trained policeman would say in this situation.]}
<P>__{(to elias)}
<D>__{get help.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{are you kidding me?}
<C>__{taft}
<P>__{(to hull, getting it)}
<D>__{oh, man, you're a cop. you're a cop, aren't you?}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(with difficulty, as if against his will)}
<D>__{yeah, i'm a cop. i'm a fucking cop...}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{oh, really? where's you badge?}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{i don't have one. i'm undercover. get help, david.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{john, that's a cop. he tried to kill you.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{he didn't know.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{oh, he didn't know. i don't know. maybe you don't know. maybe you think you're a cop because... because...}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{drop the gun, put your hands against the car. spread your legs... police!}
<A>__{taft grunts once, stiffens.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{my god! please...}
<A>__{the pulse is gone. hull begins to perform cpr.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{okay, let's say you're a cop. be a cop.}
<A>__{hull keeps doing cpr.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{we've still got the money. we put it into randy's chemistry set. in five years we're worth five hundred million each, minimum. you'll be one of the richest black men in america. richer than cosby. who gives a shit how you got it? you think the white ones were honest?}
<A>__{hull keeps working on taft.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{is this asshole all that stands between you and greatness? let me do you a favor.}
<A>__{he puts a gun to taft's head and fires. in a reflex, hull draws his own gun, shoots elias in the stomach. stunned, he wobbles backward a few steps. sits on the street.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{gee, john, that's kind of an extreme reaction.}
<A>__{hull is stunned he did it. and this finally attracts the police who see a black man with a gun who just shot a white man. hull goes to elias who's dead. a policeman pulls him off, beating him with a gun.}
