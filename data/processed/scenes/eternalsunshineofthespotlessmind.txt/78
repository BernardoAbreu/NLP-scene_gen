<L>__{interior joel's bedroom night}
<A>__{stan works on trying to get the signal back. his hair is combed and he's dressed neatly, looking professional but still stoned. mary is pacing nervously to and from the window, looking out into the night. she's dressed also, and she's wearing more make up now. her hair is pulled up into some sort of style. suddenly she freezes at the window.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{there he is. oh my god. oh my god. do i look okay?}
<A>__{she doesn't say anything.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{i'm still stoned. are you? crap.}

<C>__{mary }
<P>__{(to joel)}
<D>__{your visine didn't do shit, fella.}
<A>__{the doorbell buzzes. mary lunges for the door, then calms herself before opening it. mierzwiak, holding an equipment bag, looks surprised.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{mary. what are you doing here?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{she came to help, howard.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i wanted to learn as much about the procedure as possible, howard. i think it's important for my job...to help comfort the clientele. you know.}
<A>__{mierzwiak looks from mary to stan, nods, and enters. mary closes the door. mierzwiak crosses to the equipment.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{let's get to the bottom of this. shall we?}
<A>__{he sits down in front of the computer and does some fiddling.}
<C>__{mierzwiak }
<D>__{odd.}
<A>__{he fiddles some more. mary looks on, fascinated.}

<D>__{i tried that already.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{did you try going through c gate?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{yeah. of course.}
<A>__{mierzwiak ponders. he unzips his equipment bag, pulls out another laptop computer and plugs it in to the system.}
<C>__{mierzwiak}
<D>__{i'm going to do a spectrum search throughout his memory, see if anything comes up.}
<A>__{mierzwiak presses some more buttons. the program starts up. a much more complex and detailed human brain appears on this screen. it rotates. eventually mierzwiak sees a small distant light in the brain. he zeroes in on it.}
<C>__{mierzwiak }
<D>__{okay, here it is. i don't know why it's off the map like that, but }
