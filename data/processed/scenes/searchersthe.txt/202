<A>__{the two men dismount, beating dust out of their clothes. ethan takes another look at the sorry old nag tied outside. martin pauses beside ethan.}

<A>__{martin shakes his head. they start toward the cantina.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{there couldn't be two like that in all the world...}
<L>__{interior the cantina full shot day}
<A>__{as ethan and martin enter. it is a dirt floored room with a small bar near the door, chairs and benches along the walls. a pair of guitar players are at the far end of the room. a couple of mexicans are playing a noisy game of dominoes, slapping the dominoes down hard... emilio figueroa, back to the door, spurred boots across one of the tables, is sipping a drink. emilio is a cynical, middle aged, aristocratic looking man in modified charro costume. watching the domino game is estrella, lithe, sensuous, smoking a brown paper cigarette; she is barefoot. behind the bar is the proprietor, dozing on his stool. ethan takes a step into the room.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{mose!.... mose harper?}
<A>__{the proprietor awakens. the domino game is suspended in mid play. estrella turns... and from beside emilio, previously obscured by the man's back and the big charro hat, pokes the head of old mose. emilio turns then to look at the newcomers.}
<C>__{mose}
<D>__{ay eh...?}
<A>__{he is on his feet and advancing to meet them. as he recognizes them a wide, foolish grin splits his face and his mouth opens and closes in words that won't come out. he grabs and shakes ethan's arm, then martin's.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{leggo my arm... you look mangier 'n ever.}
