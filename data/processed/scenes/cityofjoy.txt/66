<L>__{exterior park street day}
<A>__{hasari rubs the moonstone in his ring on the shafts, then touches his heart and his forehead. a school girl in uniform, approaches the rickshaw stand. we also see several other pullers, rassoul, chomotkar, ramatullah.}
<C>__{school girl}
<D>__{rickshaw wallah!}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{let hasari go!}
<A>__{the line of rickshaw pullers turns to hasari. the other pullers wish him well as he comes forward. his heart pounds; ever so politely, he helps the school girl into his carriage. she gives him the address of the st. pius school.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i don't know where that is. you're my very first passenger.}

<A>__{she gives him a sweet smile.}
<C>__{school girl}
<D>__{that way, and then to the right.}
<A>__{his moment has arrived. he looks at ram... and thrusts his hips forward, setting off into the insanity of the traffic, eyes flicking left and right. a horn rails at him and a taxi tries to run him down, calling and laugh ing as hasari jumps in terror.}
<C>__{ram}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{feed the police!}
<A>__{other pullers laugh, call after hasari... and as he approaches the first corner, he manages to pull out a rupee and deposit it into the hand of the impassive traffic policeman and then turn right.}
