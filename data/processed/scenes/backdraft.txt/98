<A>__{it's a regular station but for the rear that has been converted into arson squad offices. as brian approaches the office door he can see rimgale sitting at his desk. standing nervously beside it is a fresh faced, uniformed probie.}
<C>__{shadow}
<P>__{(to probie)}
<D>__{...so stop me if i get this wrong... the fire's almost out... you're upstairs on the unburned floor checking for heat. you've been told by your battalion chief, your captain, by me, not to do anything up there until ordered. but now the itch starts, and all of a sudden comes the glory boy flash: hey, i'm a hero. heroes don't just stand around. so on your own you decided to punch out a window for ventilation. was that before or after you noticed you were standing in a lake of gasoline?}
<A>__{the kid is dying a thousand deaths of humiliation.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{you could've crispered half your company with that little stunt, but more importantly you wrecked the physical evidence i use to prove it's arson. you've made my day longer, probie. go home and think about that.}
<A>__{the kid shuffles off hang dog. rimgale's angry gaze falls on brian.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{uh, i'm brian mccaffrey. your new assistant.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{your dennis' kid.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i work alone.}
<A>__{and rimgale walks into his office, leaving brian marooned in the doorway. stepping behind a small partition, rimgale changes his shirt. brian can just glimpse from where he stands a horrible burn that has consumed most of rimgale's stomach. rimgale catches the look.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{are you still here?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{get used to me, inspector. i'm not going anywhere.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{then go find a corner. i don't want you in my way.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i think we should get something straight here. i was assigned to this office by the city.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{look, i knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. but that don't mean you get any slack. swayzak sends you down here, okay, i gotta eat you, that's the rules and i got nothing to say about that. but swayzak or no, you live with me. step out of line, and i don't care who knows you, i will swing the hammer.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you think you're the first?}
<A>__{rimgale glances at his watch, puts on his coat, and picks up a small paper bag.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{pest control.}
