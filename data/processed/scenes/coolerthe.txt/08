<L>__{interior casino floor night}
<A>__{bernie limps away from the bar. we hear another spike of sound from the gaming area. as he approaches, a floorman stops him.}
<C>__{floorman}
<D>__{hey, bernie, shelly needs you on eleven.}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{uh... let's do the chivas regal. have that... natalie bring it over. the one working nickel slots next to the paradise. i spoke to shelly earlier, he wants her at the tables.}
<A>__{the floorman nods, walks off. bernie makes for the rowdy gaming tables. takes his time about it. his approach brings an ill wind to the area. the players appear to sense it. it's in their reactions. a slight hesitation of the dice. fingers tensing over a pile of chips. a hand tugging at a tie. the cooler has arrived. as he reaches table eleven, natalie intercepts him with a short glass of chivas regal.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{this is you, right?}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(takes it from her)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{joe said i should stick around. you say something to shelly?}
<A>__{bernie just smiles at her.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{wow. that was fast. hey, thanks.}
<A>__{she offers up a smile. it jump starts those dormant eyes. her whole face comes alive. notches her up from an eight to a ten. bernie immediately glances away. he's afraid what she might read in his gaze.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{don't mention it.}
<A>__{bernie gestures her over to table eleven. immediately makes the high roller in question. a good old boy named bulldog. he's the one boasting loudly as he shakes the dice with one hand.}
<C>__{bulldog}
<D>__{i will make you a fortune on five and nine. c'mon forty five sixty three fifty four!}
<A>__{bernie grabs the drink from natalie's tray, intentionally bumps bulldog...}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{hey, buddy, is this your drink?}
<C>__{bulldog}
<D>__{back off, pal. i'm on a roll here.}
<A>__{another man gladly accepts the drink. meanwhile, bulldog sends the dice high up into the air. they drop perfectly on the table. the stickman calls it.}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{seven out!}
<C>__{bulldog}
<D>__{mother fucker!}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{thank you for those bets, folks.}
<A>__{the croupiers hungrily devour the chips from the table. bernie moves on quietly before anyone notices. but he's been noticed all right. by natalie. not quite sure what she's just witnessed. who is this guy? we hear a voice over the intercom.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{conway, party of twelve, please check your reservation at the paradise lounge.}
<A>__{bernie reacts immediately to the code words over the speaker.}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, i'm comin'...}
