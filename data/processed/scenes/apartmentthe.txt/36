<L>__{interior sheldrake's office day}
<A>__{mr. sheldrake is a $14,000 a year man, and rates a four window office. it is not quite an executive suite, but it is several pegs above the glass cubicles of the middle echelon. there is lots of leather, and a large desk behind which sits mr. sheldrake. he is a substantial looking, authoritative man in his middle forties, a pillar of his suburban community, a blood donor and a family man. the latter is attested to by a framed photograph showing two boys, aged 8 and 10, in military school uniforms. as baxter comes through the door, sheldrake is leafing through dobisch's efficiency report. he looks up at bud through a pair of heavy rimmed reading glasses.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{baxter?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<P>__{(studying him)}
<D>__{i was sort of wondering what you looked like. sit down.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{yes, mr. sheldrake.}
<A>__{he seats himself on the very edge of the leather armchair facing sheldrake.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{been hearing some very nice things about you here's a report from mr. dobisch loyal, cooperative, resourceful }
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{mr. dobisch said that?}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{and mr. kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office without overtime.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(modestly)}
<D>__{well, you know how it is things pile up.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{mr. vanderhof, in public relations, and mr. eichelberger, in mortgage and loan they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{that's very flattering.}
<A>__{sheldrake puts the report down, takes off his glasses, leans across the desk toward bud.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{tell me, baxter just what is it that makes you so popular?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{think.}
<A>__{bud does so. for a moment, he is a picture of intense concentration. then }
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{would you mind repeating the question?}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{look, baxter, i'm not stupid. i know everything that goes on in this building in every department on every floor every day of the year.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(in a very small voice)}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<P>__{(rises, starts pacing)}
<D>__{in 1957, we had an employee here, name of fowler. he was very popular, too. turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the actuarial department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our i.b.m. machines so the day before the kentucky derby, i called in the vice squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{the vice squad?}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{that's right, baxter.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{what what's that got to do with me? i'm not running any bookie jointerior}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{what kind of joint are you running?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{there's a certain key floating around the office from kirkeby to vanderhof to eichelberger to dobisch it's the key to a certain apartment and you know who that apartment belongs to?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{loyal, cooperative, resourceful c. c. baxter.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{are you going to deny it?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{no, sir. i'm not going to deny it. but if you'd just let me explain }
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{you better.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(a deep breath)}
<D>__{well, about six months ago i was going to night school, taking this course in advanced accounting and one of the guys in our department he lives in jersey he was going to a banquet at the biltmore his wife was meeting him in town, and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo so i gave him the key and word must have gotten around because the next thing i knew, all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets and when you give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand pardon me.}
<A>__{he whips out the nasal spray, administers a couple of quick squirts up each nostril.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming }
<P>__{(shifting into a new gear)}
<D>__{how many charter members are there in this little club of yours?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{just those four out of a total of 31,259 so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel percentage wise.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{that's not the pointerior four rotten apples in a barrel no matter how large the barrel you realize that if this ever leaked out }
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{oh, it won't. believe me. and it's not going to happen again. from now on, nobody is going to use my apartment }
<A>__{in his vehemence he squeezes the spray bottle, which squirts all over the desk.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{where is your apartment?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{west 67th street. you have no idea what i've been going through with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key }
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{how do you work it with the key?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{well, usually i slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat but never again i can promise you that }
<A>__{the phone buzzer sounds, and sheldrake picks up the phone.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{yes, miss olsen.}
