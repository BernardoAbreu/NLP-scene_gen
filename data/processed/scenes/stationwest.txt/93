<T>__{dissolve:}
<A>__{note: pick up two night exteriors of the post.}
<L>__{interior iles' office night}
<A>__{there is a sergeant inside facing iles who sits behind his desk. stellman and haven pause at the door.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<P>__{(to iles)}
<D>__{the quartermaster at platte wants three sworn statements before he'll replace those seventy uniforms, sir.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{three sworn statements! i told him all i know. they were in the freight office at west rim city. the building burned down.. .you sure he doesn't want me to send him the ashes too?}
<P>__{(seeing stellman)}
<D>__{all right, have stamm fix the papers.}
<A>__{the sergeant exits. iles looks calmly and with relish at haven.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{haven and stellman enter. stellman closes the door and stands near it. haven smiles and nods at iles, then sits down unbidden.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{nice to see you alive.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{dumb luck.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{you seem to have been living quite an adventurous life.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{is that why i'm under arrest?}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{that's indefinite. i wanted to talk to you.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{if you consult the army blue book it might enable you to be more definite.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{curiously enough, you got me into the habit of reading myself. you're quite right about the blue book }
<P>__{(fiercely)}
<D>__{unless that officer should get himself about one half as far out of line as you have!}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{how far is that?}
<A>__{iles picks up the deposition, extends it.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{right here in your own statement!}
<A>__{haven glances at him, then at the statement, and then tosses it on the desk and inhales.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i see you did what i expected.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{you've gotten a man killed and mrs. caslon's gold stolen. is that far enough?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{not quite.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(rising slowly)}
<D>__{haven as far as i'm concerned, this deposition is good enough for me.}
<P>__{(indicates the deposition)}
<D>__{i want these people arrested. this is all the evidence we need.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i need more.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{for what reason?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{for the reason i came here... to get the murderers of two soldiers not to save somebody's gold. that's a mistake you made. i still don't know who killed them, but i'm going to find out. and when the net is hauled in, they're all going to be in it.}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{that's my fish and you can have the minnows.}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(demandingly)}
<D>__{when are you returning mrs. caslon's gold?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{that's a matter between myself and mrs. caslon.}
<A>__{they look hard at each other in silence.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{i don't particularly like you but i see no reason why you should get yourself deliberately killed.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(smiling again)}
<D>__{it won't be deliberate.}
<C>__{iles}
<D>__{what difference does it make how you get killed? where does it leave me?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{where does it leave me?}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(meaning it)}
<D>__{understand this, haven. you're heading for bad trouble and when it comes don't expect any help from me. is that clear?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(smiling thinly)}
<D>__{from the beginning.}
<A>__{haven turns and walks out; the door closes behind him. iles slumps down into his chair. stellman is smiling faintly at him.}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{anything else, sir?}
<C>__{iles}
<P>__{(glumly)}
<D>__{yes, three cigars, a pint of whiskey, and a copy of that confounded blue book.}
<A>__{as stellman turns away.}
