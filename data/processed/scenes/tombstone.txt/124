<L>__{int hospital room day}
<A>__{the clock on the wall of this private denver hospital room ticks gently but inexorably as doc lies in bed with father feeney, a catholic priest, sitting at his side. painfully emaciated, his breathing shallow and labored, doc is so weak it's all he can do to even move his eyes. but he brightens as wyatt enters:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{well hell, wyatt. wyatt, i want you to meet father feeney. father feeney's just been initiating me into the mysteries of the great and ancient church of rome. you see, it appears my hypocrisy knows no bounds.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{how you feelin', doc?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{rather an obvious question under the circumstances, don't you agree? a better one might be how do you feel?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<P>__{(sits down, sighs)}
<D>__{hurts. hurts pretty bad.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i imagine it would, yes. so now we can add self pity to your list of frailties.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{all right, doc...}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you think i'm kidding. you're the most fallible, wrong headed, self deluding, just generally benighted jackass i've ever known. yet, withal, even at your worst, you're the only human being in my entire life who ever gave me hope.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{all i ever wanted was to live a normal life.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{when will you wake up? you wouldn't know a normal life if it bit you in the ass.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{that's great coming from you.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i played the cards i was dealt, wyatt. your problem is you're always trying to play someone else's. allow me to tell you the truth and thus set you free: there is no happiness, wyatt there is no normal life. there's only life, that's all. just life. the rest is relative.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{then what do i do?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{first you can grab that black haired woman and make her your own.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{all right. then what?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{run. take that girl and start running. run and don't look back. all your life you been running and looking back and just barely existing and calling it getting by. this time run and don't look back and call it living. live every second, live it right up to the hilt. live, wyatt...}
<P>__{(pauses, takes his hand)}
<D>__{live for me.}
<A>__{wyatt stares into his eyes, letting this sink in. just then, doc looks up, as if something were pressing on him. then:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{wyatt, please, if you were ever my friend, if you ever had even the smallest feeling for me, leave. leave now. please.}
<A>__{they look at each other and something passes between them, something so personal and powerful it transcends emotion. wyatt starts to speak, but:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{never mind, wyatt. i know. just go.}
<A>__{doc turns away. wyatt exits. doc looks over at father feeney:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{now let's see, father. what was that monkey show you were talking about?}
<C>__{father feeney}
<D>__{you mean extreme unction?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{that's it. better start that ball rolling.}
<A>__{father feeney nods, picking up his missal. as he starts to intone the last rites, doc looks down at the end of the bed and sees his feet poking through the sheets. they are bare. doc smiles:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i will be damned...}
<P>__{(looks at feeney)}
<D>__{this is funny.}
