<L>__{interior moria tunnel fork night}
<A>__{the path splits into three passages...each disappearing into dark tunnels. gandalf pauses, frowning.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{i have no memory of this place.}
<A>__{later... the fellowship are nervously waiting...while gandalf sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of him. he appears to be in some kind of trance. close on: frodo he turns at the sound of a faint noise down the tunnel behind them.}
<C>__{pippin}
<D>__{are we lost?}
<C>__{merry}
<D>__{no. i don't think we are. shhhh, gandalf's thinking.}
<C>__{pippin}
<D>__{merry!}
<C>__{merry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{pippin}
<D>__{i'm hungry.}
<A>__{frodo's pov: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the darkness. frodo is nervous...he approaches gandalf.}
<C>__{fro do}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{there's something down there.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{it's gollum.}
<C>__{frodo}
<D>__{gollum!}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{he's been following us for three days.}
<A>__{teasing shot: and emaciated, leering creature.}
<C>__{frodo}
<P>__{(disbelieving)}
<D>__{he escaped the dungeons of barad dur?}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{escaped...or was set loose. and now the ring has drawn him here...he will never be rid of his need for it. he hates and loves the ring, as he hates and loves himself. smeagol's life is a sad story. gandalf catches frodo's look of surprise.}
<C>__{gandalf }
<D>__{yes...smeagol he was once called...before the ring came to him, before it drove him mad.}
<A>__{gollum's withered fingers are gripping the cave wall...he is large, luminous eyes blinking with malice.}
<C>__{frodo}
<P>__{(grim)}
<D>__{it's a pity bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{pity? it was pity that stayed bilbo's hand. many that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life. can you give it to them, frodo? frodo frowns.}
<C>__{gandalf }
<D>__{do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment...even the very wise cannot see all ends. my heart tells me that gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before this is over. the pity of bilbo may rule the fate of many.}
<C>__{frodo}
<D>__{i wish the ring had never come to me...i wish none of this had happened.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{so do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. there is a note of finality in gandalf's voice.}
<C>__{gandalf }
<D>__{there are other forces at work in this world, frodo, besides the will of evil. bilbo was meant to find the ring. in which case, you also were meant to have it...and that is an encouraging thought,}
<P>__{(sudden brightness)}
<D>__{ah! that it's that way! gandalf points at the right hand tunnel...the fellowship scramble to their feet.}
<C>__{merry}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{he's remembered!}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{no, but the air doesn't smell so foul down there. if in doubt, meriadoc, always follow your nose!}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{ye s...}
