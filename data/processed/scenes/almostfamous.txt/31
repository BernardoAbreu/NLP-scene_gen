<A>__{house lights go down. cheers rise. dick's flashlight dances on the ground just in front of them, guiding their way in the dark to the stage steps.}

<A>__{russell pulls william into the band's huddle.}
<B>__{shot looking up at them}
<A>__{their band ritual, psyching together, arms on each other's shoulders in a circle. they sing a dew lines of the classic "train kept a rollin'" (or "go see cal" from the cal worthington ad) they all touch feet, and then break, heading for the stage. russell directs penny to his side of the stage. the kid follows. plugging in, still in darkness, russell hits a practice chord thwack. he steps on effects pedal. applause. (adlib onstage private patter, between members, goading each other the stuff no audience ever hears) twenty feet away, dick prepares to address the crowd from the darkened stage. it is his favorite moment of the evening, the highlight of his job.}

<A>__{light hits the stage, and the band launches into their opening song, "if you say nothing." audience response is strong. shot lingers on the face of william as he soaks in the most undeniably exciting moment of any concert, the first thirty seconds. jeff the singer grabs the microphone and launches into some vocal pyrotechnics. russell looks over to penny and william, at stage right, grinning, pretending to trip on his cord, an elegant show off move of a musician who is now where he belongs... before seriously stepping forward for the first guitar lead of the night. the kid looks over to see penny watching russell.}
