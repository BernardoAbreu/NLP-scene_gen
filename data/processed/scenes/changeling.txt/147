<L>__{interior interrogation room flashback}
<A>__{moments earlier. pushing in on "walter" for:}
<D>__{"walter" i...i knew that los angeles was where they made the tom mix movies. i figured maybe i could meet tom mix. maybe he'd even let me ride his horse.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{his horse is named blue. did you know that?}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior st. paul's church rectory day}
<A>__{christine is in a bed in a small room in the rectory, a tray beside her, still recovering from her experience. briegleb enters and approaches a nearby chair.}
<C>__{briegleb}
<D>__{how are you feeling?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{a little better, thanks. the sleep helped. anything new outside?}
<C>__{briegleb}
<D>__{nothing that can't wait until you're stronger. the police still have a car parked outside. they want to know what your next move is.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i want to go home.}
<C>__{briegleb}
<D>__{and then?}
<A>__{she takes a beat, then slowly, gingerly gets out of bed. changeling a true story}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i've been giving that a great deal of thought ever since i got out of that...place. all those women, and what they did about walter....}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they're going to just keep on doing it, aren't they? nothing's going to change...unless we make it change.}
<A>__{she glances out the window, to the police car parked across the street.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i used to tell walter, "never start a fight...but always finish it." i didn't start this fight...but by god i'm going to finish it.}
<C>__{briegleb}
<D>__{it's dangerous, and you've already been through a great deal, mrs. collins. right now you're sufficiently high profile that the police will hesitate to come after you out in the open...but if they see their position threatened, that could change quickly.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{your life could be in danger.}
<A>__{she takes a beat, then turns to him from the window.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{"always finish it. always."}
