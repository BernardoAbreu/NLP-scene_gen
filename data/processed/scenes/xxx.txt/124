<L>__{exterior castle day}
<A>__{a guard patrols the rocky grounds outside the castle. he stops for a smoke when xander walks right up to him. whack! with two quick blows he knocks him out and keeps walking. he's a man on a mission. he runs in a low crouch to the smooth castle wall. there's no hand holds, it's, a perfectly flat climb. a canyon of rocks is below. xander reaches into his jacket and pulls out the "terminator" climbing claws. he pulls on the metal gloves and claws into the solid rock. just like that he starts scaling the vertical surface. we see him outlined against the mountains, steadily making this impossible climb. at the top is an overhang. it's a gnarly transition. as he's rounding it, his feet slip. his legs dangle over the rocky chasm below. using all his strength, he pulls himself up the rest of the way with his climbing claws. at the top a guard leans over, aiming his gun at him. xander grabs him and pulls him over the edge. the guard falls into the chasm. xander rolls onto the parapet, exhausted. then another guard rushes him, grabbing for his rifle. xander springs, the claws lashing out, and tears the gun from his hands. with the other hand he slashes, taking the guard down. he pulls off the claws and heads into the guard tower.}
