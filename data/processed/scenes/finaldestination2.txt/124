<D>__{make way, make way lovebirds.}
<A>__{kimberly spins as eugene's orderly passes her; a paper, pen and a crossword book in one hand, a birthday cake in the other. the cake reads "happy birthday gregory". the thirteen sparkling candles on top oddly frame clear's head.}

<D>__{oh no...}
<A>__{the orderly speeds down the corridor toward clear, whose hand reaches for eugene's door handle. she leans into it }

<P>__{(to clear)}
<D>__{thanks hon, the henzels are going crazy for this thing.}
<B>__{thomas and kimberly}
<A>__{watch as clear opens the door, briefly revealing eugene, a whoosh of oxygen boom!!! clear's body is obscenely hurled end over end towards the camera, heading straight for kimberly and thomas! thomas throws himself and kimberly around the corner to prevent being crushed by clear's lifeless body! the hospital erupts in total chaos. just as kimberly is about to break down completely, she sees a woman hurrying down the hallway in their direction, pushing a crash cart. kimberly sees the nametag: kalarjian.}

<D>__{nurse kalarjian...}
<C>__{dr. kalarjian}
<D>__{doctor kalarjian. excuse me, please.}
<B>__{angle on cart}
<A>__{defribulator paddles rest on top. and then dr. kalarjian passes them toward the area of the explosion. kimberly ominously turns, the camera following her view, until she sees a small lake across the street from the hospital.}

<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{just then, an ambulance skids up to the nearest entrance. paramedics jump out and run towards the blast site.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{you can't cheat destiny. i know what i have to do to save us. i have to die.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{that's crazy. you can't give up now. we can still fight this thing.}

<B>__{ambulance}
<A>__{a red stripe down the side, but the hood is completely white. six floral scented air fresheners hang from the rearview. the 'van' from her vision! and it's running!}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i have to do this.}
<A>__{kimberly wipes tears from her eyes, kisses thomas' cheek, then turns and runs before he can speak.}
