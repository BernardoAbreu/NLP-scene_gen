<L>__{exterior approaches of soweto afternoon}
<A>__{stanley drives seemingly alone at very high speeds, which he maintains through the streets of soweto... using his horn to scatter people out of his way, to the anger and indulgence of others. the car screeches to a halt outside emily's house. stanley gets out of the car and greets the startled neighbors... and acknowledges the friendly shouts of children. stanley looks around, then goes back to the car, opens the back door, leans and says something. suddenly, to everyone's astonishment, ben crawls out of the car; stanley hustles him into emily's house. stanley waves at the people, a sign of assurance, then closes the door behind him.}
