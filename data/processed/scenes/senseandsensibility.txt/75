<L>__{exterior barton park drive day}
<A>__{people and carriages fill the drive, the sun shines and the atmosphere is pleasantly expectant. sir john is organising the provision of blankets and parasols and colonel brandon is busy furnishing the drivers with their routes. there are three new faces a pretty, blowsy woman (charlotte palmer), a stony faced man (mr palmer) and an exceedingly good looking girl (lucy steele), who are standing with elinor, marianne, margaret, mrs jennings and mrs dashwood. marianne is standing slightly apart, looking out along the road, impatient for willoughby.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{imagine my surprise, mrs dashwood, when charlotte and her lord and master appeared with our cousin lucy! the last person i expected to see! 'where did you pop out from, miss?' says i. i was never so surprised to see anyone in all my life!}
<A>__{lucy steele smiles shyly and looks at the ground. mrs jennings continues sotto voce to mrs dashwood.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{she probably came on purpose to share the fun, for there are no funds for such luxuries at home, poor thing.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i had not seen you for so long, dear mrs jennings, i could not resist the opportunity.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{oh, you sly thing! it was the misses dashwood she wanted to see, not delaford, mamma! i have heard nothing but 'miss dashwood this, miss dashwood that' for i don't know how long! and what do you think of them now you do see them, lucy? my mother has talked of nothing else in her letters since you came to barton, mrs dashwood. mr palmer are they not the very creatures she describes?}
<A>__{mr palmer regards his wife with a less than enchanted expression.}
<C>__{mr palmer}
<D>__{nothing like.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(laughing gaily)}
<D>__{why, mr palmer! do you know you are quite rude today? he is to be an mp, you know, mrs dashwood, and it is very fatiguing for him for he is forced to make everybody like him he says it is quite shocking }
<C>__{mrs palmer}
<D>__{i never said anything so irrational. don't palm all your abuses of the language upon me.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<P>__{(to mrs dashwood)}
<D>__{mr palmer is so droll he is always out of humour.}
<A>__{mr palmer does indeed have the air of a man under siege. willough by suddenly appears in his curricle. marianne waves to him with a radiant smile. mrs jennings nudges charlotte and points to marianne.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{here he is! now you shall see, charlotte.}
<A>__{willoughby drives up as close to marianne as possible, making her laugh.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{how now, mr willoughby! you must greet my daughter charlotte, and mr palmer }
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{how do you do?}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{and my little cousin, miss lucy steele.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{welcome to our party, miss steele!}
<A>__{lucy bobs demurely. willoughby inclines his head politely, leaps from the curricle and hands marianne in. mrs jennings coos and chuckles at them. charlotte nudges elinor.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i know mr willoughby extremely well not that i ever spoke to him but i have seen him forever in town. your sister is monstrous lucky to get him. mamma says colonel brandon is in love with her as well, which is a very great compliment for he hardly ever falls in love with anyone.}
<A>__{elinor smiles politely. willoughby moves the curricle out to the front of the drive. charlotte points after them and laughs with mrs jennings. lucy edges up beside elinor.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{may i beg a seat beside you, miss dashwood? i have so longed to make your better acquaintance! i have heard nothing but the highest praise for you.}
<A>__{elinor is relieved to change the subject.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i would be delighted. but sir john and mrs jennings are too excessive in their compliments. i am sure to disappointerior}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{no, for it was from quite another source that i heard you praised and one not at all inclined to exaggeration.}
<A>__{lucy speaks in a knowing, confidential undertone, as though not wanting anyone else to hear. at that moment a horseman thunders up the drive towards them. everyone turns to face the new arrival.}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{what can this be?}
<A>__{it is a messenger who has obviously had a long, hard ride. he asks for colonel brandon and hands him a letter, which brandon tears open. mrs jennings is puce with suppressed curiosity.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{my horse! quickly!}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{what is the matter, brandon?}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{i must away to london.}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{no! impossible!}
<A>__{everyone gathers round brandon, who is, naturally, mortified. a servant brings up the colonel's horse.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{imperative.}
<A>__{there is a murmur of disappointment from the party. sir john is embarrassed and protests again.}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{but brandon, we are all assembled. we cannot picnic at delaford without our host! go up to town tomorrow.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{or wait till we return and start then you would not be six hours later.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{i cannot afford to lose one minute.}
<A>__{as he speaks, he is mounting his horse. his grave urgency silences all protest and he gallops off, leaving everyone stunned and, of course, deeply curious. then they all start to talk at once. lucy is still next to elinor.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{oh, miss dashwood, i cannot bear it! just when i was to have the opportunity of speaking with you.}
