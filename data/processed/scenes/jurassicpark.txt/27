<L>__{int ext cruisers, fourth tour stop late afternoon}
<A>__{the cars twist through dense vegetation with a grinding of gears. the first car comes to a jerky stop. there is a huge triceratops lying on its side, moving very slowly, breathing laboriously. harding, the tall, balding park vet, kneels on the ground. he peers into the animal's mouth with a large flashlight. before the second car can stop completely, grant leaps out, races to the trike. regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase grant and ellie. grant joins harding on the ground. the trike lets out a low moan. she's too sick to move. ellie and lex squat by the animal.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i feel so sorry for her. she's so sick.}
<C>__{vet}
<D>__{we don't know what's wrong with freda. every six we}
<A>__{eks she gets like this.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{oh, she'll be up and around in no time. after a big night, i feel the same way.}
<A>__{grant very gently opens the trike's mouth.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{poor girl. what's the matter? ellie, look at this.}
<A>__{a dark purple tongue droops limply from her mouth. ellie shines the light on it, illuminating silvery blisters. gennaro turns away.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{microvesicles. interesting.}
<A>__{grant scratches one of the blisters with his ball point pen. it oozes. the kids share a grossed out look.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{doesn't she have a mommy and a daddy?}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{we make these dinosaurs in the lab, sweetheart. but they do form attachments. freda has a little one that follows her around, thinks freda's his mom.}
<A>__{grant starts to look around.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{what does sh}
<A>__{e eat? where does she feed?}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{animal this size takes in a minimum of six hundred pounds of plants a day. we truck in hay and meadow grasses seven times a day. that's all she touches.}
<A>__{grant studies the nearby grass and bushes. timmy quietly follows grant. ellie lifts a huge eyelid on the triceratops. a runny eye just stares. grant comes up triumphantly with a bouquet of weeds clutched in his hand. these weeds have little purple berries. ellie looks over.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{west indian lilacs!}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{these'd give anybody a stomachache.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{i'm telling you, the animals don't eat don't eat that stuff.}
<A>__{regis keeps a babysitter's eye on the kids. timmy comes up with a handful of smooth stones. he approaches grant shyly.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{dr. grant, sir? how 'bout these? there'}
<A>__{s lots of little piles of these? grant fingers one distractedly, then suddenly comes to attention.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{hey, ellie take a look at his. good work, timmy.}
<A>__{ellie gets up, brushes herself off, comes over and examines the stone.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{extremely smooth. purple stains, could be those lilac berries.}
<A>__{she and grant smile and each other and nod. gennaro is curious.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{looks like your trike swallows stones to help her digest her food. walking around, she crushes berries against the stones. and even just a little crushed berry is eventually enough,}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{so, she poisons herself periodically.}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{bet we tested her saliva for any trace of }
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{but with th}
<A>__{e stones, she swallows them}
<D>__{and probably bypasses any mucosal contact. straight to the stomach. i would test her excrement.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{yo, yuk!}
<A>__{a light rain begins. automatically, with a soft hiss, the glass roofs of the cruisers slide shit. gennaro taps regis and indicates the cars.}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{hey regis, where are your rain gods? it's gonna pour. let's finish our tour.}
<A>__{grant agrees, heads for the cruisers. he turns and looks for ellie. ellie stands by the trike. she gives grant a meaningful look.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i'm staying.}
<A>__{grant smiles at her decision.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{soil samples?}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{you read my mind.}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{i think she's sicker then they're saying. her skin is dry and flaky. and her gums are pale. i'm going to talk to dr. wu.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{good idea. i will keep my eyes open.}
<A>__{gennaro climbs in with grant. the two cruisers start off and timmy turns backward to stare wistfully at grant. regis and lex wave to the trike. grant looks back to ellie who has already begun to work. on trike a mosquito lands on its back. the trike's tail slaps it dead.}
