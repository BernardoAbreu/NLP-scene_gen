<A>__{kelly strides purposefully out of the woods. pauses against a split rail fence beneath the innocent sun. across the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned barn. but not for long, as two german infantrymen appear around the corner of it. kelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation. unaware, the germans smoke and talk. kelly's too far away to hear them but he watches their every move. they're relaxed, not as on guard as they should be. their karabiners rest slung across their backs.}

<A>__{he takes his smith & wesson 1917 pistol from his pistol belt and steps out into the sunlight field in plain sight of the guards. surely he knows they can see him. he must want them to see him. but they don't. too busy passing nudie wallet photos. halfway across the open grass, kelly raises the pistol but does not aim it. just strides steadily closer, arms spread out, making himself an easy target. crazy as it seems, private kelly ernswiler is trying to get himself killed.}
