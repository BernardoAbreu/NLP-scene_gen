<A>__{the conversation continues as jeffrey and agent #3 enter the hall.}
<D>__{agent #3 normally if we caught a guy sneaking around like this with no i.d., we'd bust his ass, excuse the french, but this one said he knows you...}
<P>__{(smirk, smirk)}
<D>__{ and, since you seem to have had some...uh...unusual...uh..."associates", we certainly didn't want to arrest one of your, uh, closest...pals.}

<A>__{cole, smudged with dirt and car grease, sitting in the shadows in a wingback chair, looks up as jeffrey and agent #3 enter the room. a fourth agent looms beside the wingback chair.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<P>__{(dismissing cole casually)}
<D>__{never saw him before in my life. go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{you do know me. you helped me once.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<P>__{(turning to leave)}
<D>__{that would be totally out of character. helping people is against my principles.}
<P>__{(to the agents)}
<D>__{see, he definitely doesn't know me. now, i'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science while you torture this intruder to death.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i'm here about some monkeys.}
<A>__{halfway out the door, jeffrey freezes. a beat.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{excuse me what did you say?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{monkeys. twelve of them.}
<A>__{jeffrey frowns, turns, considers cole. then, suddenly, jeffrey rushes to cole and embraces him.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{arnold...arnold.}
<A>__{cole is astonished. the agents are, too.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<P>__{(stepping back)}
<D>__{my god, arnie, what's happened to you? you look like shit agent #3}
<P>__{(dubious)}
<D>__{you know this man?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{of course i know him. what do you think i act like this to strangers? listen you fellas are terrific. i thought you were pulling a number on me. what a terrible thing if you'd thrown old arnie out. i owe you guys the big apologia! mea culpa, fellas.}
<P>__{(turning to cole)}
<D>__{christ, arnie, it's black tie! i mean, i said, "drop by," but, like, this is dad's big "do"...vips, senators, secret service, and...and everything.}
<A>__{jeffrey throws an arm around cole's shoulder and starts leading him toward the door as the two agents exchange narrow eyed looks.}
<D>__{agent #4 "arnie?"}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{arnold pettibone. old arnie pettibone. used to be my best friend. still is. what've you lost, arnie forty pounds? no wonder i didn't know you. you hungry? lots of dead cow, dead lamb, dead pig. real killer feast we're putting on tonight.}
<A>__{the agents watch jeffrey lead the limping, disheveled cole out.}
<D>__{agent #4 these people all of 'em are true weirdoes! agent #3}
<P>__{(moving to the phone)}
<D>__{i'm gonna call in a description of this "pettibone" character. you go keep an eye on him. make sure he doesn't do one of the guests with a fork.}
