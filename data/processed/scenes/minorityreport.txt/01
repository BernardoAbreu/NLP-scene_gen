<A>__{morning in america. just look at it. america in the midfifties, the suburban landscape stretching endlessly into the sun drenched distance. white house upon white house. emerald lawns, glistening with dew. in each driveway, a big chevy, or a ford, muscled with chrome, long tailfins that taper like the fins on rocket ships. kids burst out of the houses, and zoom down sidewalks on trikes. mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways, watching. the smiling mothers wave to one another, then go back into their houses. dogs bark, birds sing in trees of just the right height, boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes. it is a delicious world, where dogs and birds and children are safe.}
