<L>__{92 full shot river copters}
<A>__{a sky crane without pod descends slowly toward us the p.b.r. hangs below it. the chief, mr. clean and chef stand watching this sight alomg with other soldiers. a man guides the descending copter till the boat settles carefully in the shallows. the chief and others leap aboard; unshackle the hoists load on ammunition and fuel. the battle is still going on around them. they all look up as a wadge of phantoms streak over low and peel off one by one to begin their bombing run.}
