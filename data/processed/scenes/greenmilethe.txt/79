<L>__{exterior house in tefton back porch day}
<A>__{burt hammersmith, public defender for trapingus county, sits with a cold soda and a magazine, watching his two children playing on a swing at the far end of the backyard. the screen door opens and cynthia hammersmith ushers paul out.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i offer you a cold drink?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes, ma'am, a cold drink would be fine. thank you.}
<A>__{she goes back inside. burt rises.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{mr. hammersmith. your office said i'd find you at home today. i hope i'm not troubling you.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{that depends, mr. ?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{paul edgecomb. i'm the e block superintendant at cold mountain.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{the green mile. i've heard of it. lost a few clients your way.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's why i'm here. i'd like to ask you about one of them.}
<A>__{burt settles back down, motions "please sit".}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{which client? now you got my curiosity aroused.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{john coffey.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{ah, coffey. he causing you problems?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, can't say he is. he doesn't like the dark. he cries on occasion. other than that...}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{cries, does he? well, he's got a lot to cry about, i'd say. you know what he did.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{i read the court transcripts.}
<A>__{cynthia reappears, hands paul a cold root beer.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{thank you, missus.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{my pleasure. kids! lunch is about ready! y'all come on up!}
<A>__{she goes back inside, but the kids aren't quite able to tear themselves away from their play.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{what exactly are you trying to find out? satisfy my curiosity, i will see if i can satisfy yours.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i've wondered if he ever did anything like that before.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{why? has he said anything?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no. but a man who does a thing like that has often developed a taste for it over time. occurred to me it might be easy enough to follow his backtrail and find out. a man his size, and colored to boot, can't be that hard to trace.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{you'd think so, but you'd be wrong. believe me, we tried. it's like he dropped out of the sky.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{how do you explain that?}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{we're in a depression. a third of the country's out of work. people are drifting by the thousands, looking for work, looking for that greener grass. even a giant like coffey wouldn't get noticed everywhere he goes... not until he kills a couple of little girls.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{he's...strange, i admit. but there doesn't seem to be any real violence in him. i know violent men, mr. hammersmith. i deal with 'em day in and day out.}
<A>__{burt smiles, realizing:}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{you didn't come up here to ask me whether he might have killed before. you came up here to see if i think he did it at all. that's it, isn't it?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{one seldom sees a less ambiguous case. he was found with the victims in his arms. blurted out a confession right then and there.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yet you defended him.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{everyone is entitled to a defense.}
<A>__{cynthia hollers from an open window:}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{kids! lunch!}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{y'all listen to your momma, now!}
<A>__{the kids start this way. burt turns back to paul.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{tell you something. you listen close, too, because it might be something you need to know.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm listening.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{we had us a dog. no particular breed, but gentle. ready to lick your hand or fetch a stick. just a sweet mongrel, you know the kind.}
<P>__{(paul nods)}
<D>__{in many way, a good mongrel dog is like you negro. you get to know it, and often you get to love it. it is of no particular use, but you keep it around because you think it loves you. if you're lucky, mr. edgecomb, you never have to find out any different. my wife and i were not so lucky. caleb. come here for a second.}
<A>__{the little boy comes to him, staring at his feet. burt tires to raise the boy's chin. the boy resists for a moment...}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{please, son.}
<A>__{...and then his face comes around. he's horribly scarred on that side, the eye missing.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{he has the one eye. i suppose he's lucky not to be blind. we get down on our knees and thank god for that much at least. right caleb?}
<P>__{(the boy nods shyly)}
<D>__{okay, go on in now.}
<A>__{the boy races inside after his sister. paul follows burt's gaze off toward the rear of the property, where an unoccupied doghouse stands weathered and sad in the weeds.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{that dog attacked my boy for no reason. just got it into his mind one day. same with john coffey. he was sorry afterwards, of that i have no doubt...but those little girls stayed raped and murdered nonetheless. maybe he's never done it before my dog never bit before, but i didn't concern myself with that. i went out there with my rifle and grabbed his collar and blew his brains out.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm sorry for your trouble.}
<A>__{burt acknowledges the condolence with a gracious nod.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{i'm as enlightened as the next man, mr. edgecomb. i would not bring back slavery for all the tea in china. i believe we have to be humane and generous in our efforts to solve the race problem. but we have to remember that the negro will bite if he gets the chance, just like a mongrel dog will bite if it crosses its mind to do so.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{is coffey guilty? yes, he is. don't you doubt it, and don't you turn your back on him. you might get away with it once or even a hundred times...but in the end...}
<A>__{he raises his hand, making biting motions with his fingers.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{you understand?}
<A>__{paul says nothing. burt gazes out again. softly:}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{i'm gonna have to tear that old doghouse down one of these days.}
