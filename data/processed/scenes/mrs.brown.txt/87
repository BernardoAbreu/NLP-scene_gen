<L>__{interior windsor castle, stables night}
<A>__{brown marches down the line of horse boxes. a stable lad, barney, is feeding the horses. he looks twitchy.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{hey, barney.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{mr brown, sir }
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{it's cold out there tonight, barney.}
<A>__{reaching his pony, brown stops and smiles. the animal lifts its face to him and he softly strokes his muzzle.}
<C>__{brown }
<D>__{yeah, there's a good girl.}
<P>__{(to barney)}
<D>__{have you had a look at this hoof? she was limping badly. i think there might be a stone in it.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, i did.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{good man. and is she all right?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{good. she's a good girl. aren't you? yeah, she's a lovely girl. and you know the queen's riding tomorrow?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{brown}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you all right, barney?}
<A>__{barney twitches again and brown realizes too late. the split second he turns, he sees three men.}
<C>__{brown }
<D>__{oh, aye...}
<A>__{the men pile onto him and he collapses under their weight. as he falls, brown manages to yank himself round, bang up a fist and fling the others off him. but the first man is up again, twisting an arm round his neck and tugging him back. the others grapple his arms down, but brown is incredibly strong. even now, grunting and scrabbling, he makes them fight to force him back. barney stands transfixed in horror. dumping brown against the wall, the men step back and start kicking the shit out of him. brown curls into a ball, jaw locked, hands over his head. not a sound. finally, they back off, panting hard. the first man pulls out a bottle of whiskey, yanks back brown's head and forces whiskey down his throat. it spills over his face and dribbles down his neck.}
