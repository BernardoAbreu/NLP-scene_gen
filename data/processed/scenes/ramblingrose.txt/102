<L>__{interior hillyer home buddy's bedroom night}
<A>__{a shot close on rose and buddy in bed. evidently rose has weakened and is allowing him to fiddle with her, but we can only surmise this, the shot is on their heads and shoulders and a cloud has crossed the moon, the light is more dim. a different look is on her face, a solemn expression as if she is listening to some far away sound that she finds strangely haunting. she moistens her lips, speaks in a slightly feeble voice.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{you better quit that.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{but rose...}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i must be outta my mind. buddy, quit it.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{am i hurting you?}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(pauses, stares off as if}
<D>__{listening, then in an even feebler tone, a half}
<P>__{whisper)}
<D>__{no. no, you're not hurting me.}
<P>__{(moistens her lips, swallows)}
<D>__{but i think you better quit it.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{but why, if i'm not hurting you?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{you wouldn't understand.}
<P>__{(puts a hand on his}
<D>__{shoulder as if to push him away, but can't; puts her other hand over her}
<P>__{eyes)}
<D>__{oh, god, i must be outta my mind. what would your momma think?}
<A>__{the hand falls limply from rose's eyes and she turns her head to the side and closes her eyes. helplessly, she lies there as the boy fiddles with her.}
