<A>__{there is a commotion among the crowd as the mayor's limousine arrives with a police escort. jack hardemeyer steps out followed by the mayor himself and they cross to the museum entrance. hardemeyer, his assistant and several police bodyguards confront the ghostbusters.}
<C>__{hardemeyer}
<D>__{look, i've had it with you. get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here. this is a city matter and everything's under control.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{oh, you think so? well, i've got news for you. you've got dracula's brother in law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid. around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants. and that's just round one.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{are you telling me there're people trapped in there?}
<C>__{hardemeyer}
<P>__{(to his assistant)}
<D>__{this is dynamite. call a.p., u.p.i., and c.n.n. and get them down here right away. when the police bring this kid out i want them to hand it right to the mayor and i want it all on camera.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{mr. mayor, if we don't do something by midnight, you're going to go down in history as the man who let new york get sucked down into the tenth level of hell.}
<A>__{the mayor stops to consider the situation.}
<C>__{mayor}
