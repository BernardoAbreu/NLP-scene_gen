<L>__{interior dinner club night}
<A>__{the tremor brothers pilot a dodge barracuda right through the front window with wrecking ball bravado. bodies scatter as the tremors deploy from the car in full body kevlar, doing doomsday on the club. one of them fires up a chainsaw, chewing into the panicked crowd. bodyguards blast back, but bullets play like spitballs against the tremor's body armor.}
<C>__{dupree }
<D>__{donald mcgarey, the local union rep, is the mark. the tremors go ripshit riot on the whole club, seven people dead, twenty eight wounded. just to get to this one guy.}
<A>__{shotguns roar blast spreads obliterate a shitstorm of blood, spilled booze and busted glass }
<C>__{dupree }
<D>__{ and they get it about as good as they give it. in the melee, one of the brothers catches blowback from a jammed piece and is temporarily blinded, the other takes bullets to the lower back and can't walk. the third gets popped in the neck and passes out. mcgarey gets out of the club alive...and not much further...}
