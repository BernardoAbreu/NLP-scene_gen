<A>__{windows and the boards covering them begin to smash inward. a student pounding in nails is caught, pulled out the window. a vampire crawling in is spiked by pike. another makes it in and is smashed on the head repeatedly by andy. it staggers, smilingly, and turns toward him.}

<A>__{andy manages to shove the two by four in its heart just as it gets its fingers around his throat. kimberly screams. one of them has hold of her, starts pulling her out the window. nicole runs to her, starts pulling the vampire's hands off her. suddenly, the vampire grabs nicole instead. off balance, she is almost out the window before kimberly can react, and all kim can do is scream. andy and pike make it to the window too late; nicole is pulled out, and they swarm over her.}
