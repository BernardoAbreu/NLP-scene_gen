<L>__{3. downwards angle stella}
<A>__{as she senses someone standing over her, someone staring at her body through the half grown hedge which separates the horan back yard from the white house next door.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{what are those?}
<L>__{4. stella's pov carrie white}
<A>__{a terribly appealing little girl, a child of indeterminable age. pink cheeks, a halo of blonde white hair which will darken in time. what sets her apart from other children, however, are a pair of bright button brown eyes; and it's these eyes that we notice as she peers at stella through the hedge.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{hiya, carrie. gee you gave me a fright.}
<P>__{(turning down the radio)}
<D>__{how long have you been there?}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(not smiling; pointing with her finger)}
<D>__{what are those?}
<A>__{stella looks where carrie is pointing; the top of her bikini has slipped, just barely revealing her breasts white against the golden tan. stella adjusts her suit not out of any particular modesty of her own but as a reflex at being stared at so strangely.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{those are my breasts, honey.}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(a beat; then solemnly)}
<D>__{i wish i had some.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{you will. `course you'll have to wait a couple of years, but}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(a fact)}
<D>__{no i won't.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{why, sure you will.}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(emphatic)}
<D>__{no, i won't.}
<P>__{(glancing behind her)}
<D>__{momma says no... momma says good girls don't.}
<C>__{stella}
<P>__{(at something of a loss)}
<D>__{well, i'm a good girl. and besides, doesn't your mother have breasts?}
