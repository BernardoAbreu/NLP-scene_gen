<A>__{jeff honks his horn, flashes his lights.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{c'mon, you fat ass. pull over.}
<A>__{either the driver doesn't notice, or he's ignoring jeff, but the truck does not slow down. jeff shifts into the oncoming lane and pulls alongside the cab. he honks again and waves, gesturing for the truck to pull over. but the peterbilt maintains its speed. jeff cranes his neck to get a glimpse of the driver...}
<B>__{pov shot}
<A>__{it's red, alright. but he's wearing a different cap. from this angle, we can't see into the passenger side of the cab. red peers down at jeff, puzzled. jeff shouts at him, waves:}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{pull over! pull over!}
<A>__{red suddenly notices something ahead in the road, blares his horn. jeff looks up, sees an rv camper approaching in the oncoming lane!}
<B>__{highway}
<A>__{jeff swerves onto the far shoulder as the rv whooshes past in the opposite direction, horn blaring.}
<B>__{cherokee}
<A>__{jeff is rattled, catching his breath. he swings back onto the road.}
<B>__{highway}
<A>__{jeff slips in ahead of the peterbilt, then starts weaving and braking, forcing the truck to slow. both vehicles pull to the side of the road and stop. jeff leaps out of the cherokee and runs over as red climbs down from the empty cab. (note: throughout this scene, various cars and trucks pass in either direction.)}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{jesus, pal, what the hell you doing?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i was signaling you to stop. didn't you see me?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{jeff reacts. how thick can this guy be?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{where's my wife?}
<C>__{red}

<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{my wife. where is she?}
<A>__{red gives him a puzzled look.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{how should i know where your wife is?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i checked at the diner. no one saw her there.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{mister, i don't know what you're talking about.}
<A>__{jeff stares is this guy nuts?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{you gave her a ride. you were supposed to drop her at belle's diner.}
<A>__{red searches his memory, trying to be as helpful as possible. he shakes his head.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{nope. sorry.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{how can you not remember? it was just half an hour ago, for chrissakes!}
<A>__{red gives him a peculiar look.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{mister, i never seen you before in my life.}
<A>__{suddenly, there is a loud squawk from inside the cab the cb radio.}
<C>__{cb voice }
<P>__{(filtered)}
<D>__{breaker, breaker iron man, you copy?}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(reacts)}
<D>__{your radio works }
<P>__{(locks eyes with red)}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing ?}
<A>__{jeff freaks out, circling the truck, calling loudly:}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{amy? amy?! you in there?}
<A>__{red shrinks back, unnerved.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{look, mister, i don't know what you want, but }
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i want my fucking wife, is what i want! what have you done to her?!}
<A>__{red's eyes dart to something in the distance. jeff catches this, turns... sheriff's patrol car cruising toward them. jeff runs into the middle of the road and waves frantically. the patrol car switches on its flash bar and speeds up, pulling to a stop behind the peterbilt. sheriff boyd, 50ish, climbs out, sizing up the situation. jeff runs over.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{officer, i need your help!}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{what's your problem?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i don't know, this guy has my wife!}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{calm down, sir. tell me what's going on.}
<A>__{jeff catches his breath.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i don't know what the hell's going on. last time i saw her she was with this guy in his truck. now he's saying he's never seen her!}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{officer, he's crazy i don't know what he's talking about.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{don't lie, you son of a bitch!}
<A>__{the sheriff unsnaps the safety strap on his holster... just a precaution.}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{all right everybody just calm down.}
<P>__{(to jeff)}
<D>__{sir, you want to tell me what happened?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{our car broke down. this guy stopped to help us, said he'd drive my wife to a pay phone. but she never showed up.}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<P>__{(turning to red)}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{i don't know, officer. i'm driving along, suddenly this fella runs me off the road and starts hollering about his wife. i swear, i never seen the guy before.}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{and you didn't give his wife a ride?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{he's lying!}
<A>__{the sheriff takes a long look at both of them, unsure what to think. he turns back to red.}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{sir, all right with you if i search your truck?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{hell yes, officer. go right ahead. name's red, by the way. red barr.}
<P>__{(pulls out his wallet)}
<D>__{my permits are all current. you can check 'em out.}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{that won't be necessary yet. just stand back behind the line. both of you.}
<A>__{as red closes his wallet, several credit cards fall to the ground. he bends to scoop them up. jeff eyes this suspiciously. the sheriff climbs up into the truck.}
