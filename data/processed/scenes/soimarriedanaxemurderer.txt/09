<B>__{charlie}
<A>__{pushing open his apartment door in a mock swat maneuver, then stealthily stalking toward the sound of the intruder in the bedroom. he stubs his toe on a spring loaded doorstop making a loud metal vittswingggg's sound. he freezes, terrified.}

<A>__{he freezes.}
<B>__{reverse angle to reveal}
<A>__{that the hands belong to the angelic blonde in the broken picture. it's charlie's girlfriend, sherri.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{sherri! what are you doing?}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{i'm leaving you.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{oh, thank god... i thought you were robbing our own home, because frankly, that's insane. i mean, what could you possibly gain by robbing your own home? i don't mean to meddle, but isn't it better to rob other peoples' homes? start accumulating their wealth as opposed to just reaccumulating your own wealth.}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{that's not funny, charlie. i'm really leaving.}
<A>__{she continues to pack. charlie tries to unpack her things.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what?! just because we had a fight last night?}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{we've had a fight every night for two months. ever since i brought up the subject of marriage, you've found fault with everything i do. why couldn't we have gotten married, charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm too young to get married.}
<P>__{(begins putting her things back)}
<D>__{i'm only twenty nine and a half. we love living together.}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{it's been two years now. i need something more.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{see, sherri, this is frustrating for me, okay. when we first started going out i thought we agreed that we weren't the sort of people who got married.}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{that's like saying we're not the sort of people who are going to grow old. we're not going to fall into that "growing old" trap. face it, you've got a problem with commitment, charlie. take a look at your other girlfriends. every time you get close to a commitment there's something wrong with them.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey, i broke up with them for good reasons.}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{what about sandy?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{sandy was an alcoholic.}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{no no no. you thought she was an alcoholic. she just drank more than you drank. what about jill?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{she hated my family.}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{you thought she hated your family. nobody hates your family. everybody loves your family. what about julie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{she smelled like soup.}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{she smelled exactly like campbell's beef vegetable soup. she was dirty, physically dirty.}
<C>__{sherri}
<D>__{well, charlie, i wonder what you're gonna say were my problems? are you gonna tell your friends that i was a junkie, that i wasn't supportive enough or that i smelled like relish? charlie, i loved you. it could have worked out.}
<P>__{(she goes to the door)}
<D>__{think about it.}
<A>__{she leaves. angle on the broken picture}
