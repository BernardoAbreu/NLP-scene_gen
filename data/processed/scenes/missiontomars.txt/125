<A>__{luke, now in a patched up pressure suit and grubby looking helmet, stands peering down unhappily at the improvised sledge, with its meager supplies. mcconnell, terri, and phil walk up behind him, wearing their helmets again. they hear luke over his radio.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{so... let me be sure i understand this. your ship blew up, with all its supplies. then you emptied the cargo out of the remo, and it was totalled on landing. you've got no food, no water, no spare oxygen, nothing but what i see here...?}
<A>__{mcconnell and the others are silent, embarrassed. then mcconnell nods. luke looks at him, a cracked grin.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what kinda rescue mission is this?}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{that kind.}
<A>__{he points to the computer repair case, as phil lifts it off a sledge. luke turns, looks at the case, then phil.}

<D>__{check it out. new nav boards for the erv. i got four round trip tickets, baby, right in here.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{four.}
<A>__{in some mysterious way, this reminder of woody's death seems to bring him fully back into himself. he takes terri by the shoulders, deeply saddened. she meets his gaze.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{terri... i'm so sorry. he was a good man.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{thanks, luke.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{when there's time, we'll talk.}
<A>__{she nods, grateful. a beat. he looks at the others.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{this way.}
<A>__{he starts off across the sand, and they follow.}
