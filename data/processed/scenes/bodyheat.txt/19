<L>__{interior racine's apartment day}
<A>__{racine sits in bed smoking a cigarette. at the mirror, a nurse in a fresh white uniform steps into her white shoes and begins attaching her cap with bobby pins.}
<L>__{interior cocktail lounge pinehaven night}
<A>__{dark. almost classy. the place is half full. matty is drinking at the end of the bar, her cigarettes next to her glass. the bar chairs near her are empty. racine comes in, looks around, walks over and sits in the seat next to her. she looks up, surprised.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{look who's here. isn't this a coincidence?}
<A>__{racine looks at her, almost as though he can't place her. but he doesn't push that effect hard. he lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i know you.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{you're the one that doesn't want to talk about the heat. too bad. i'd tell you about my chimes.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{what about them? converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{the wind chimes on my porch. they keep ringing and i go out there expecting a cool breeze. that's what they've always meant. but not this summer, this summer it's just hot air.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{do i remind you of hot air?}
<A>__{the bartender has come up.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{bourbon, any kind, on the rocks.}
<P>__{(to matty)}
<D>__{another?}
<A>__{she thinks, then nods her agreement. the bartender moves away.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{what are you doing in pinehaven?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i'm no yokel. why, i was all the way to miami once.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{there are some men, once they get a whiff of it, they'll trail you like a hound.}
<A>__{the bartender brings their drinks and leaves.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i'm not that eager.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{what is your name, anyway?}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(offers his hand)}
<D>__{ned racine.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{matty walker.}
<A>__{she takes his hand and shakes it. racine reacts strangely to her touch and doesn't let go right away. she gently frees it, then refers to his look as she picks up her drink }
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{are you all right? converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{matty}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{yes. my temperature runs a couple degrees high. around 100 all the time i don't mind it. it's the engine or something.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{maybe you need a tune up.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{don't tell me you have just the right tool.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i don't talk that way.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{how'd you find me, ned?}
<A>__{racine gives her a look.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{this is the only joint in pinehaven.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{how'd you know i drink?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{you seemed like a woman with all the vices.}
<C>__{matty}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you shouldn't have come. you're going to be disappointed.}
<A>__{racine looks out over his drink. several of the men in the place are looking at them.}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(referring to the men)}
<D>__{what'd i do?}
<C>__{matty}
<P>__{(indicating racine's chair)}
<D>__{a lot of them have tried that seat. you're the first one i've let stay.}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(spotting a few more)}
<D>__{you must come here a lot.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{most men are little boys. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{maybe you should drink at home.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{too quiet.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{maybe you shouldn't dress like that.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{this is a blouse and a skirt. i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{you shouldn't wear that body.}
<A>__{natty leans back in her seat and glances down at herself. she's magnificent.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i don't like my body much. it's never been right.}
<A>__{racine has been looking at her body too. with her line, he just laughs. matty watches him, then leans over her drink. her tone is different.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{sometimes, i don't know. i get so sick of everything, i'm not sure i care anymore. do you know what i mean, ned?}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(he's not sure)}
<D>__{i know that sometimes the shit comes down so heavy i feel like i should wear a hat.}
<A>__{matty laughs, studies him.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{yeah, that's what i mean.}
<A>__{ratty drains her glass and stubs out her cigarette.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i think i will get out of here now. i'm going home.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i will take you.}
<C>__{matty}

<A>__{racine again accepts.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{this is my community bar. i might have to come here with my husband some time. would you leave before me? wait in your car? i know it seems silly...}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i don't know who we're going to fool. you've been pretty friendly.}
<A>__{she gives him a look and then slaps him hard! everyone turns toward them.}
<C>__{matty}
<P>__{(steadily)}
<D>__{now leave me alone.}
<A>__{she stands up, takes her purse and her cigarettes, and walks to the other end of the bar, where she sits down. racine watches her with amazed eyes. he stands up and throws some money on the bar.}
