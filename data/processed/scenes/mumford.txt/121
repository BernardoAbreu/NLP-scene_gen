<L>__{interior mumford's office day}
<A>__{nessa's on the couch, playing with her usual unlit cigarette. there's an uncharacteristic lightness to her.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{...i mean, doc, the dude is seriously deluded. i said that to him, i said, "if you think i'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what'd he say?}
<C>__{nessa}
<P>__{(can't hide her pleasure)}
<D>__{he said "which we already knew!"}
<A>__{mumford laughs, delighted.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what did he want you to do?}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{first off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. i told him abso fuckin' lutely no. as you can see }
<A>__{she holds up the cigarette as though it were her middle finger, flipping the bird.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{then he says stop smoking dope. no again. so then he says he doesn't want me getting together with any other guys...}
<A>__{mumford doesn't have to see her face to know how much pleasure this gives her, despite her hard ass cover.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{...what balls on this guy? what're we...}
<P>__{(too geeky for her)}
<D>__{...going steady? jesus.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{no again?}
<C>__{nessa}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{i said i'd consider it. nobody owns me. and the last thing was insane. i don't know what's wrong with him... no magazines.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{i don't know if i can quit. we're gonna try it together, like, you know, aa or something. and i made him give up his .22. no more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{he agreed?}
<C>__{nessa}
<P>__{(yes)}
<D>__{he's pitiful, doc, a goddam puppy. i don't know how much longer i can put up with it. i already got two arms and legs, i don't need another appendage.}
<A>__{she takes a look at her watch and immediately lights her cigarette as she stands up }
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{oops... gotta go!}
<A>__{she heads toward the waiting room. mumford gestures to indicate the back door. she waves him off. he shakes his head no one wants to use the back anymore. nessa opens the door to the waiting room. martin brockett is sitting there. he makes a gesture to nessa to underline the fact that he is not reading any of the many magazines lying around, then stands up. she goes into his arms like maybe she's the puppy. he beams and looks at mumford.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{hiya, doc.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{martin.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(pulling nessa tighter)}
<D>__{did you straighten her out?}
<A>__{nessa give him an affectionate punch in the side, then blows smoke in his face.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{how are you?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{insane! didn't ja hear? my family got five hundred times better.}
<P>__{(turning nessa)}
<D>__{let's go, vanessa.}
<A>__{nessa gives mumford an embarrassed, "ain't he corny?" look, but as they go out the door, she's never looked happier.}
<C>__{gilroy }
<D>__{doctor mumford?}
<A>__{mumford is startled to find a man in a suit, gilroy, rising from the chair behind the door. he's got a briefcase and a document in his hand.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i didn't see you there. can i help you?}
<C>__{gilroy}
<D>__{my name's gilroy. i'm from the state certification board.}
<A>__{he proffers the document in his hand, but mumford doesn't take it.}
<C>__{gilroy}
<D>__{it's all right, it won't bite you. under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. this is the notice.}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{(takes the paper)}
<D>__{do you want to come in?}
<C>__{gilroy}
<P>__{(already leaving)}
<D>__{no thanks. plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{mr. gilroy }
<A>__{gilroy stops, outside door already open.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what brought this on?}
<C>__{gilroy}
<D>__{i'm not at liberty to say. sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complainterior we'll be in touch.}
<A>__{he goes out. mumford considers the paper in his hands, thoughts elsewhere.}
