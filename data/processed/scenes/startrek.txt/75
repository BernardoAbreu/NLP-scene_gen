<L>__{exterior starfleet shipyard morning}
<A>__{the shipyard is abuzz with activity cadets loading into a shuttle and pike, staring off, waiting. the pilot approaches:}
<C>__{shuttle pilot}
<D>__{waiting for something, cap?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{... no. guess not.}
<A>__{he climbs in. the pilot rapidly flips through switches, running a pre flight sequence. pike straps in. glances through the viewshield... sees something... and he smiles. from his pov: kirk on his motorcycle, driving into the shipyard }
<C>__{pike }
<D>__{hold her a second...}
<A>__{kirk rides past a waterfall of cooling tanks stops the bike near the shuttle steps off, has nothing no bags just the clothes on his back.}
<C>__{shipyard worker}
<D>__{nice ride, man.}
<A>__{kirk kicks the stand, tosses the guy the startcard }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{live it up.}
<A>__{kirk walks past the startled worker and approaches pike.}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{four years? i'm gonna do it in three.}
<A>__{pike grins as kirk passes him. inside the shuttle, kirk moves down rows of new recruits, some of them alien. passes uhura and the barfight cadets, who perk up when they see him one has a bandaged hand.}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{at ease, gentlemen.}
<P>__{(then, to uhura)}
<D>__{never did get that first name.}
<C>__{uhura}
<P>__{(can't help it: a grin)}
<D>__{and you never will.}
<A>__{he smiles as he takes a seat at the back of the shuttle. straps in as it rises...}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{are you people deaf? i told you i don't need a doctor, damnit! i am a doctor!}
<A>__{kirk turns to see a man being forced out of the bathroom by a female flight officer at 34, he has a southern lilt and looks like a prisoner waiting for the guillotine to fall:}
<C>__{flight officer man}
<A>__{ you need to find a seat i had one, in the bathroom,}
<D>__{darlin', with no windows }
<A>__{ sir, for your own safety, i suffer from aviaphobia, siddown, or i will make you case you don't understand big sit down... do you hear me? words, it means 'fear of dying right now. in something that flies.' they glare at each other, then the man drops into the seat beside kirk. the ship torques to one side and the man grips his armrests, pale, sweating glances at kirk:}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i might throw up on you.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i think these things're pretty safe }
<C>__{man}
<D>__{don't pander to me, kid: one tiny crack in the hull and our blood boils in thirteen seconds solar flare might crop up, cook us in our seats hell, some of the damn passengers are blue. and wait'll you're sitting pretty with a case of andorian shingles, see if you're still so relaxed when your eyeballs are bleeding space is disease and danger, wrapped in darkness and silence.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i hate to break this to you, but starfleet operates in space.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{yeah, well my ex wife took the whole damn planet in the divorce, i got nowhere to go but up. leonard mccoy.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{jim kirk you really gonna throw up ?}
