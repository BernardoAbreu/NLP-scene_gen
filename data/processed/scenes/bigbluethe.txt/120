<B>__{later}
<A>__{johana is still on the phone, sitting in front of the bay window. day is dawning.}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(looking out at the skyline)}
<D>__{it's getting light out.}
<C>__{jacques }
<D>__{here, it's getting dark.}
<A>__{johana smiles. she stretches, lies down on the carpeted floor. jacques seems to have gone through all topics of conversation.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{i've been thinking about you a lot, you know...}
<A>__{johana is by now completely stretched out on the floor.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{so have i.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{... hello?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{i'm still here.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{well, then, talk to me some more.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{... it's hard you know. you're so far away and i don't know what else to say.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{then, tell me a story.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{uh... ah! a story?}
<A>__{he turns around and sits on the window sill, his feet dangling in mid air. he looks at the sea, seeking inspiration.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{do you know how it is?}
<P>__{(starting again)}
<D>__{do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{no... tell me.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{you go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there... and you decide that you will die for them... only then do they start coming out. they come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... if it's sincere. if it's pure... they will be with you and take you away forever.}
<A>__{johana listens with the abandon of a child being put to sleep.}
