<L>__{exterior entrance to terrace on johana}
<A>__{johana comes out of the stone tunnel which leads to the terrace. she looks over the crowd, trying to find someone. jacques is sitting with his back to her. she finally spots him and walks over to the table.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{eh! la madonna! this one is for me. i will bet you my watch that she's in my bed tonight.}
<A>__{jacques turns around and recognizes her. johana smiles and walks up to the table. enzo takes his watch off and puts it on the table.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{i tell you she's mine!}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(to jacques)}
<D>__{hello!}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{you know each other?}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{enzo molinari.}
<A>__{enzo kisses her hand and brushes his watch off the table in the same movement.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{this is a great pleasure.}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(laughing at the protocol)}
<D>__{johana cross, pleased to meet you.}
<P>__{(then to jacques, faking surprise)}
<D>__{well! isn't this a coincidence. i really wasn't expecting this... all the way out here. it's incredible!}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{please, have a seat.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{thank you. i wouldn't want to interrupt anything.}
<A>__{johana sits down.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{no, no!}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{not at all!}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{you're staying at the hotel?}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{i wish, but it's full. they recommended a pension in town. they say that all of taormina is full. what's going on here?}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{it's the free diving world championship. i am by the way world champion!}
<A>__{johana has turned toward jacques, paying no attention to enzo. jacques can't stop looking at johana.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{but what brought you to sicily?}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{i was doing an insurance investigation in palermo.}
<P>__{(to enzo)}
<D>__{i work for an insurance company.}
<P>__{(back to jacques)}
<D>__{so, i decided to take a few days off.}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{i don't know this island at all. it really is gorgeous.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{there is no place in the world more beautiful than sicily!}
<A>__{the waiter passes behind them. enzo reaches out, grabs him by the arm, pulls him to the table.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(to waiter)}
<D>__{a spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i think i will have a coffee.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{no, no. you'll like it. it's superb.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{... okay. i will try.}
<A>__{enzo pours the wine. johana shrugs fatalistically. the waiter leaves. jacques, intrigued, stares at johana. she pretends not to notice.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{where did you two meet?}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{in a lake.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{i might have known.}
<P>__{(to johana)}
<D>__{as i was telling you earlier, i'm the world champion free diver.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{congratulations.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{some people say it's the most virile sport in the world. one has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{enzo?}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{your mother?}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{ahi, ahi, cazzo! ma mamia! where...? god, she'll kill me...}
<P>__{(pushing the plate in front of johana)}
<D>__{... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.}
<A>__{he quickly brushes off the crumbs in front of him. on enzo's mother heading toward them. she's a huge woman in widow's black. she shoulders her way through the tables. roberto carrying her suitcases follows at her heels. enzo jumps to his feet. throws his arms around her.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{... mamma!}
<C>__{mamma molinari}
<P>__{(expressionless)}
<D>__{you expect me to carry all the luggage myself?}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{mamma. roberto and an elevator... isn't that enough?}
<A>__{a beat. signora molinari inspects the plates on the table.}
<C>__{mamma molinari}
<P>__{(suspiciously)}
<D>__{what have you been eating?}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{coffee only, i'm diving tomorrow. you remember little jacques, jacques mayol...}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(timidly)}
<D>__{madame...}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{... and his friend, johana...}
<A>__{signora molinari nods grudgingly.}
<C>__{waiter}
<P>__{(arriving proudly)}
<D>__{spaghetti del mare!}
<A>__{dead silence. enzo is the only one with no plate in front of him. signora molinari's eyebrows condense into a dark stripe across her forehead. johana hands enzo's plate to the waiter and takes the full one.}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(to waiter)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{and begins to eat, ignoring the expressions of amazement all around her.}
<C>__{mamma molinari}
<D>__{americana?}
<A>__{johana nods enthusiastically, her mouth too full to speak.}
<C>__{mamma molinari}
<P>__{(impressed, to johana)}
<D>__{benvenuto!}
<A>__{mamma molinari has a huge grin on her face.}
