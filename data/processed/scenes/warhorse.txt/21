<L>__{exterior field. day.}
<A>__{early morning. dad hobbling across the furrows, alone, planting the field by hand.}
<L>__{exterior narracott farm. devon country montage.}
<A>__{albert and joey are now in a meadow. they trot past the field he plowed, now packed with a strong and sturdy crop, which ted tends to. the sun is breaking through and joey starts to run across the field and up a small incline. as both joey and albert gain confidence they pick up speed. albert pushes joey on, they are going faster and faster, albert yells with the exhilaration of it all. joey races flat out across the countryside. albert hanging on for dear life. albert and joey pull up beside a sleek red car. it's lyons' car, being driven by david lyons, every inch the expensively tailored rural gentry.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{um, i'm the only boy that drives in the village. no one else drives but me.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{oh, yeah?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{that's right and this is my dad's car. you're lucky that you're in it. i'm not normally allowed to drive it `cause it's so }
<A>__{albert urges joey to go faster, till they're neck and neck beside the car, racing it. david lyons looks to see albert and joey running alongside his car. he feigns disinterest. albert glances at david, but he's much more interested in the very pretty young woman seated next to david, her hands trying to control her hair, flying in the wind. forgetting himself momentarily, albert stares at her, dazzled. the woman turns to david:}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{is he a friend of yours?}
<A>__{she smiles at albert, encouraging him. david lyons, annoyed, pushes the accelerator down, and the car edges ahead of joey. but not for long. the sound of the acceleration and albert's eagerness to impress the young woman make joey go faster, and again he moves out ahead of the car. the young woman grins at albert. up ahead albert sees that the wall alongside of which he's been racing turns the corner, presenting him and joey with an obstacle. albert encourages joey to go faster.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{come on, boy, let's show her how to fly!}
<A>__{they head right for the wall, but at the very last moment, joey balks and comes to a dead standstill, sending albert sailing over the wall. back in the car, the girl gasps and covers her mouth, concerned. david says nothing, but allows himself a small smile. on the other side of the wall, albert stands a bit battered, but unfazed.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{well...you're clearly not gonna be a jumper.}
<A>__{thunder starts to rumble ominously in the background.}
