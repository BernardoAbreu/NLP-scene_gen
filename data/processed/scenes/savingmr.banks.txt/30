<A>__{pamela is open mouthed.}
<C>__{walt }
<D>__{you can't imagine how excited i am to finally meet you!}

<C>__{walt }
<D>__{come here! come here!}
<A>__{he links his arm through hers, much to her chagrin, and leads her into his interior office past an imposing floor to ceiling cabinet bursting with academy awards.}
