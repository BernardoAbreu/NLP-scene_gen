<L>__{exterior church day}
<A>__{storming. the meeting is letting out. near the churchyard gate, young masbath rides with katrina following on a horse cart. ichabod walks up as katrina dismounts.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{what is so urgent?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{come with me.}
<A>__{ichabod leads her to where they can talk away from others.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{why have i not seen your face for so long? you look much better.}
<A>__{she touches his face, but he takes her hand, places the loan agreements there.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{explain these. i found them secreted away in the sewing room.}
<A>__{katrina's expression changes just so slightly to guilt.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{why... why have i scrambled and run and clawed in all directions, only to find you against me?}
<A>__{he stares at her. katrina stares back, in a small way defeated. she looks for an out, but there is none.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{i have been reading your journal. i'm sorry. i found it too fascinating to resist.}
<P>__{(pause, ashamed)}
<D>__{i rode to catch up with you at the notary, out of curiosity. before i found you though, i overheard what you were said.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{it was you there?}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{when... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, i could not believe it. i had to hide these... at least till i could confront him myself.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{and, what did he say?}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{he did not do these things. if you knew him, you would realize...}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{what did he say, katrina?}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{i have not been able to face him yet.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{the loans give the land to your father. it does not matter survivors are still on their farms. they could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{yes, i have seen that, and i told you why i hid them.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{what would you have me believe?}
<C>__{katrina}
<P>__{(tiring, angry)}
<D>__{if you think i am behind this, say it.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{the name van tassel is blackened. you share that name.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{call me a liar, then, and a murderess. say it, out and out.}
<A>__{many people are starting to notice the confrontation.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{katrina...}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{speak the words, constable. what is stopping you? what has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?}
<A>__{emotions tear at him. rain seems to pound down harder.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{oh, no. no. please... don't dare stand looking as if you still care for me, after all that you have said. if i were to confess, would that ease your suffering? would that make it easier for you to hate me?!}
<A>__{a tortured cry is heard o.s. baltus comes charging through the square on his horse.}
<C>__{baltus}
<D>__{the horseman is coming!}
<A>__{he's barely hanging on. he stops, practically falling off, running towards katrina and ichabod.}
<C>__{baltus}
<D>__{save me...}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{father?}
<C>__{baltus}
<D>__{he killed her...}
<A>__{baltus grasps katrina, fearful. hoofbeats are heard.}
<C>__{baltus}
<D>__{the horseman has killed her.}
<A>__{far behind, the horseman rides to follow, axe held up. instant mayhem people scatter all directions, screaming. baltus runs headlong to the church.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{father!}
<A>__{katrina runs after baltus. ichabod backs away, watching the horseman come, then heads to the church with masbath. baltus pushes through the iron gate, into tent city, joining the swarm of townsfolk pouring into the church. the horseman rides behind, closing the gap. men, women and children run for cover all along the square. amidst the churchyard panic, ichabod looks back... the horseman reaches the open gate and daredevil suddenly rears up, snorting, unwilling to enter. the horseman grabs daredevil's reins, tries to move forward again. same result. daredevil freaks out.}
