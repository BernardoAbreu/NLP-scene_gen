<L>__{interior jehuda zyskind's room evening}
<A>__{chaos. papers, pamphlets strewn all over the place. the mimeograph smashed. szpilman enters, stands, surveying the devastation. distant sounds of shooting, shouts, cries. he gathers up some papers in a pile, takes off his jacket and covers the pile of papers, making a pillow. he lies down on the floor. he stares into the darkness, expressionless, empty.}
<L>__{exterior street near cafe nowoczesna day}
<A>__{szpilman shuffles along, comes to the cafe. no sign of life, but the door is wide open. he goes inside.}
