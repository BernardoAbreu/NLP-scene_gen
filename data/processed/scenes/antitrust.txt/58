<A>__{a youthfully upscale place, a converted red brick warehouse. alice looks great. the waiter pours wine.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{this feels fairly grown up, i'd say.}
<A>__{milo smiles (again it looks forced) raises his glass.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{to our new life.}
<P>__{(she's looking at him)}
<D>__{...what's wrong?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{that's what i need to ask you.}
<P>__{(when he says nothing)}
<D>__{you know you can't keep anything from me.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{he gave me some new code fixes this morning. i said, "did you really do this just today?" cause i was impressed. he said "what're you implying?"}
<A>__{she just looks at him. he grows a little defensive:}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{it's the way he said it. just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. that's how you knew you were onto something ugly.}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(just confused)}
<D>__{what would it mean, anyway? if he didn't write it?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{that's what i'm asking myself. does he have some genius stowed away? why not let him write skywire.}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{'not saying it makes sense.}
<A>__{a busboy leaves a basket of rolls. glum, preoccupied, milo takes one without looking, brings it to his lips }
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{milo!}
<A>__{he looks at alice, looks at the roll, blanches.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i'm so stupid.}
<A>__{he throws the roll back into the basket.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{he's your boss. he's not your }

<P>__{(he's nodding)}
<D>__{i know, i know.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{if you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(the very idea hurts)}
<D>__{isn't that extreme?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{what's extreme is what that er doctor said when he pumped your stomach. eat another sesame seed and that's it.}
<A>__{we see the rolls: covered in seeds.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i mean, if one little comment from gary is gonna upset you this much }
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{you're right. it's a working relationship. don't know what i was expecting.}
<A>__{he smiles. but his heart's not in it. she hates to see him suffer. she picks up her glass.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{c'mon. let's do the toast?}
