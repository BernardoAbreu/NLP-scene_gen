<L>__{exterior drug farm night}
<A>__{narcos are shouting, running to and fro. tracer rounds cut through the air. they are trying to repel an unseen assault force. overhead six military helicopters buzz the compound like apocalypse now, their night suns lighting up the place. xander comes out of the torture building holding t.j. in a fireman's carry. his hands are still cuffed, the length of chain dragging. xander crouches behind some equipment, putting t.j. on the ground.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you alright?}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{i used to be a seal, it's not the first time i've been shot. thanks, man.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{keep your head down, i will be right back. i'm gonna steal us some wheels.}
<A>__{xander moves on, finds cover under the camouflage netting. he can see narcos shooting into the trees at the unseen enemy. looking the other way, he spots virg running back his way. he's been corralled by one of the helicopters. he's zigzagging, trying to stay out of the beam of it's night sun. xander darts out and grabs him, pulling him under the camouflage netting.}
<C>__{virg}
<D>__{they're all over the place! what the hell's going on?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.}
<A>__{the helicopter lights up the camouflage netting. they're pinned down.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{alright mr. free for all, you go that way, i'm gonna go this way. they can't follow us both.}
<A>__{they squat down in runners stances, the helicopter kicking up dust all around them.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{they jet off in opposite directions. xander books, running for all he's worth. his cuffed hands and the dangling chain make it difficult. he's heading straight into the field of pot plants. suddenly the massive spotlight picks him out.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{the chopper swoops down after him. its big gatling guns turn, aiming right at him. braaaaaaaappp! the guns cut loose, tearing up the ground right behind him. xander sprints, the chopper after him like cary grant in "north by northwest", except instead of corn fields, xander's running through a field of huge marijuana plants. xander hits the deck and the chopper soars over him. xander cuts over a couple rows and hunkers down amongst the plants. all around him it's a chaos of helicopters and gunfire. two choppers attack the factory building, blasting it with their guns. narcos run terrified. xander notices a fat purple bud on the plant right in front of him. he snaps it off.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i'm gonna need to hit the trees after a night like this.}
<A>__{he tucks it into his shirt and takes off through the pot}
<B>__{forest.}
<A>__{xander finally spots a vehicle. it's a truck laden with bails of cocaine. he heads for it. then the spotlight finds him again and the chopper swings around. the gatling guns rip the plants to pieces all around him. xander hauls ass, heading for the truck. bullets chew up the dirt all around him. as the helicopter passes overhead, it's guns rake the truck. there is a flash as the gas tank goes up. whoooopphh! a supernova of fire and high grade coke erupts into the night air. xander dives into a drainage ditch. he tumbles down into}
<B>__{filthy water.}
<A>__{a powdery cloud washes over him, dusting the trees white. near him is a big drainpipe leeching sewage. xander crawls inside. the chopper makes another pass overhead. the big spotlight plays over the area, then moves on. xander gives a sigh of relief. he crawls out of the drainpipe. jeeps race by on the road right above him as military men flood the compound. there's no going back. xander turns and makes his way along the tree line. the chopper and gunfire are in the distance now. things are quieter here and he starts to relax. bad idea. as he goes by, one of the trees moves. he takes a few more steps and the grass he just walked on explodes upwards. arms reach out, tackling xander from behind. another team of black ops soldiers bursts from the weeds, the bushes, all perfectly camouflaged like the landscape. they fall on him like a curtain. xander's p.o.v. soldiers hold him down while a black hood is pulled over his head.}
