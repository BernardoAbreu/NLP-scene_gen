<A>__{mumford and skip come out of the trees, climb onto the big rock, and settle down. the sun is falling over the town of mumford.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{...we're like friends, almost... who trust each other.}
<A>__{he checks mumford's reaction. mumford nods, offers skip water, who turns it down. mumford takes a swig.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i want to tell you something, doc, but before i do, i need to ask you a question... because, for me to tell you this thing well, i haven't told anybody about this. it's the biggest secret i've got.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{you're a shrink, doc. aren't i supposed to be able to tell you everything?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{it's just a thought.}
<A>__{skip, even more unsure now, looks away, at the town below.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{that really relates to the thing i want to ask you... i've noticed that sometimes, not a lot, but sometimes, when we're hanging out, throwin' the ball... or that time we went bowling... sometimes you'll like }
<P>__{(gets it out fast )}
<D>__{ tell me things about your other patients.}
<A>__{mumford lets that hang a few moments, then acknowledges it silently. now skip is even more nervous.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{hey, maybe that's all right! i don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something i missed... or something...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you're concerned that maybe i can't be trusted with a secret.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i trust you. definitely. no question. but, yeah, i'm a little concerned. i mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?}
<A>__{mumford looks at skip for a long moment.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{that is correct, skip. i'm going to have to take a long look at that.}
<A>__{the conversation seems to end there. skip's not sure where to go nexterior finally }
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{yeah, well... what i was gonna tell you }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{ skip. knowing what you do about me }
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{doc, i trust you! you've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.}
<P>__{(leans in, intense)}
<D>__{and this secret i've got, i can't stand it anymore. i don't know if i'm some kind of }
<A>__{skip looks around at the darkening woods, though clearly there's no one around.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{ i don't know if i'm a pervert or what. it's taken me this long to get where i can come out and say it... i can't back away now. i can't spend another day not knowing if i'm nuts.}
<A>__{skip closes his eyes for a second and gathers himself.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{all right, i'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as i can.}
<P>__{(one last spasm of doubt)}
<D>__{and you understand that this is a big secret? just between us?}
<P>__{(mumford does)}
<D>__{okay. you know i've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you are panda, monarch of modems.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{that's right. and you also know that even though i make 23% of the modems in the world... i cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{okay... let's say that, for now.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{it's true, believe me. so... do you know what i've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... mr. find the need and fill it. how i spend my every solitary hour?}
<A>__{mumford shakes his head, "no."}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{guess.}
<P>__{(mumford demurs)}
<D>__{go ahead, guess!}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{(if he must)}
<D>__{jerking off?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{no!... although that's a good guess. no, what i've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create }

<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{slash what?}

<D>__{sexual surrogate... slash... companion.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{a doll?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{no, doc, not a doll. i am panda. i'm talking about much, much more than a doll. the world has never seen what i'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.}
<A>__{mumford considers that a long time, watching as the sun finally sinks below the horizon. he looks back at skip.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{how's it coming?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{you don't think i'm insane?}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{("no")}
<D>__{and that's your secret?}
<P>__{(skip: "yes")}
<D>__{you meant like a trade secret?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{no, doc, a private secret! it's perverted, it's pitiful. what am i dr. frankenstein? aren't you repulsed?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{sounds like kind of a good idea.}
<C>__{skip}
<P>__{(nonplussed)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{definitely.}
<A>__{it's getting dark fast now. mumford reaches into his bag and takes out the headlamp we saw earlier. he fits the straps carefully over his head.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{skip, that's not much of a secret.}
<C>__{skip}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{it's not?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{oh, it's okay. it's just not something to be ashamed of. maybe you don't want people knowing and believe me, it's safe with me but on the scale of dirty little secrets, i'd give it, say... a two.}
<A>__{mumford twists the headlamp and the light shines out in the dusk. mumford turns the beam directly at skip.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you want to know a secret? i will tell you a secret. since it's just between us and all...}
<A>__{skip, hanging on every word now, agrees emphatically.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{the secret, skip, is this i am not now, nor have i ever been... a psychologist.}
<A>__{at first, skip thinks he's misunderstood mumford. but in the huge silence that ensues, he replays it and knows he's heard right. mumford looks around, adjusts his headlamp, and gets up.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{we'd better get going. just follow my light. and, skip, watch your step.}
