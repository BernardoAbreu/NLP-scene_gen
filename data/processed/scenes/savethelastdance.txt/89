<L>__{exterior street (somewhere in baltimore) night}
<A>__{post ballet, sara and patrick walk. she's quiet, introspective. patrick's at a loss. he can't decipher her mood and, which is more, he's disappointed by it.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i thought you would like it.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{you ain't actin' like you did.}
<A>__{she looks over at him, tries to smile.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{they come to a small, secluded bridge. sara sits down on the edge of it. patrick follows suit. a long moment.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i don't want you to think i didn't have a good time tonight, patrick. i did. but ballet isn't a part of my life anymore.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{why not? what happened? you just woke up one day and decided to waste your talent.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(without rancor)}
<D>__{how do you know i have talent? because i did some stupid leg trick.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i saw the look on your face when you did it, sara. the same look i saw tonight. goofy happy. so if you're gonna tell me somethin' about not dancing, at least tell me somethin' real.}
<A>__{a long, difficult moment wherein sara attempts to find the words, face the pain that comes with them. finally, she looks at him.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{maybe i don't want it to be real.}
<A>__{she stares out at the water, the moon reflected off of it. it's hard to reconcile that beauty and the turmoil she's feeling. but she goes on.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{what i want is to wake up and see my mom. for things to go back to the way they were. when they made sense. when my life made sense.}
<P>__{(because)}
<D>__{and it's all my fault. she got scraped off the highway for me, for my fucking audition. she was rushing. it was raining. it was raining...}
<P>__{(a torrent)}
<D>__{... but she promised to be there. i made her promise. and then i didn't wait for her. i should have but they called my name and i didn't say anything. i just went out and danced. i was mad. i needed her and she wasn't there.}
<A>__{she buries her face in her hands, breaking down, racked with tears and guilt. patrick puts his arms around her.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(inconsolable)}
<D>__{she was dying while i was dancing and i was mad at her and i'm sorry. i'm sorry...}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{it's not your fault it rained or she died. or that you danced. that's what you were there for. your mom would've expected you to do what you did.}
<A>__{sara, choking on tears, regards him forlornly.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{that's what makes it so bad. she always did what was right for me. i wanted to be a prima ballerina had to be. even if it took most of our money, all of her spare time. i didn't care. it was my stupid dream and it killed her. all she wanted was for it to come true.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{you still got whatever you had when your mom was alive, sara. she wouldn't want you to give up.}
<A>__{sara swipes at her face, looks up at him, still crying.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i know... but she... i just don't think i can do it without her.}
<C>__{patrick}
<P>__{(holding her)}
<D>__{do you want to do it, sara? i mean you. do you want juilliard?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{yeah. i do.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{then it's on you to make the dream come true.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{yeah. for my mom.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{for her. for you.}
