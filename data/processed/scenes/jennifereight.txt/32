<L>__{31: interior principal's officer. institute. day.}
<A>__{goodridge is mid 50's with a beard like abraham lincoln. sits far side of his desk alternating eyes between ross and berlin. the latter studies a photograph of a girl in a file. it's pos sible they've found jennifer two? "how recent is the picture?"}
<C>__{goodridge}
<D>__{as recent as we have .. what ex actly is your interest in amber?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i'm afraid i can't give you an ans wer to that, mr goodridge. as i ex plained to your secretary, we're do ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..}
<C>__{goodridge}
<D>__{then what are you hoping i'm gon na do? dissuade, or persuade you?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?}
<C>__{goodridge}
<D>__{then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, sergeant. what i said on the phone's the same as i'm saying now. i got no idea where amb er is, or who it was took her there.}
<A>__{he doesn't like them but not as much as ross doesn't like him.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{a blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?}
<C>__{goodridge}
<D>__{you find something curious in that?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{yeah, i guess i do.}
<C>__{goodridge}
<D>__{then let me put your mind at ease .. firstly, amber isn't "blind" she has some useful vision and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education a severe vis ual disability doesn't mean my stud ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else and amber was a very independent young woman she decided to leave so she left ..}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{and you got no idea with who?}
<C>__{goodridge}
<D>__{no, sergeant, i got no idea with who. and i might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their christmas holidays with pe ople whose name i won't know either ..}
<A>__{ross could sock him in the crop but the phone rings and he ex cuses himself to answer it. whatever he hears he isn't liking.}
<D>__{you have an appointment with miss robertson?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{goodridge}
<D>__{as she's a member of my staff, may i ask what this is about?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{well, apparently, she saw amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.}
<C>__{goodridge}
<D>__{i see .. well, she's teaching an other class at four .. i'd apprec iate it if you don't detain her ..}
