<A>__{woodlands. beautiful. untamed. soaring old growth elms arch over riverside maples along the shores of the gently curving, deep water santee river.}
<T>__{superimposition:}
<C>__{south carolina}
<D>__{april, 1776}
<A>__{upstream, the swamps. beautiful. hundreds of birds sing. shafts of sunlight pierce the canopy, cutting through the hanging moss and kudzu, falling onto soft, swaying ferns covering the high ground. the water is clear, with fields of floating lily pads, each with a stark white flower rising from it.}
<T>__{superimposition:}
<C>__{the following is based on a}
<C>__{true story}
<L>__{exterior pond bluff day}
<A>__{a farm built between the banks of the river and the deep green of the swamps. good, fertile land, hacked out of the wilderness. the perfectly tended fields are ripe with barley, hops, alfalfa and tobacco. two sturdy brothers, nathan, 13 and samuel, 12, work one of the fields, rhythmically swinging scythes through the barley. the house, built of native brick, is well constructed and well maintained. there's a barn, a workshop and a forge. it is a home of substance rather than wealth. on the front porch, margaret, 11, pumps a butter churn while her brother, william, 6, watches. gabriel, 18, strong and handsome, walks out of the woods with a musket in his hand and a dozen game birds over his shoulder. at his side walks thomas, 14, also carrying a musket.}
<L>__{interior workshop day}
<A>__{a perfect colonial workshop, fastidiously arranged with every conceivable tool of the period. a foot powered lathe. a drop forge. a lifting saw. racks of tools, planes, hammers, augers, drills, blocks, all hanging in their places. all very well worn. francis marion methodically works his lathe, turning a piece of hardwood, shaving off tiny curls of wood with a razor sharp chisel. he's in his late forties, strong and weathered. his hands, though big and callused, handle the chisel with a surgeon's precision. self educated and self sufficient, he has built himself, as he built his farm, brick by brick, from the coarse clay of the earth. a finely made rocking chair, missing only the dowel on which marion is working, sits on the work table. the chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider web of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue. sitting on the woodpile, susan, 4, a silent, stone face wisp of a child, watches her father. marion takes the piece of wood out of the lathe, carefully fits it into the chair, inserts a peg and taps it into place. then he steps back and appraises his handiwork. he picks up the chair and hooks the top rail to a scale, countering with a three pound weight. the chair floats. marion blows softly on the weight which sinks. susan nods, so far, so good. marion puts the chair on the floor and walks slowly around it, checking every angle. then, the acid test. he takes a deep breath and lowers himself onto the seat, gingerly adding an ounce at a time. not a creak. he smiles and sits back with a sigh. crack! the chair splinters under marion's weight, dumping him on his ass on a pile of broken wood.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{damnation!}
<A>__{he picks up some of the wood, about to fling it across the room but stops as susan shoots him a disapproving look. he calms himself.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{susan gets down from the woodpile and puts the remains of the chair in the fireplace. as she climbs back up to her perch, marion steps over to his wood rack, extracts a fresh dowel, fits it into the lathe and starts all over again.}
<B>__{end credits.}
<L>__{exterior workshop dusk}
<A>__{marion leaves the workshop with susan at his side. nathan and samuel walk past, exhausted from their day in the field.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{father, i saw a post rider at the house.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{thank you. did you finish the upper field?}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{we got it all cut and we bundled half of it.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{those swimming breaks cut into the day, don't they?}
<A>__{marion walks on without waiting for a reply from his contrite sons who jostle one another, trying to pass off the blame. gabriel and thomas walk out of the barn.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{father, a post rider came from charleston. you have a letter inside.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{thank you. how's the spotted one's milk?}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{better. she's near ready to calve.}
<A>__{marion nods and motions for susan to go with gabriel and thomas to the house. she does so and marion walks on alone toward:}
<L>__{exterior hilltop pond bluff sunset}
<A>__{the loveliest spot on the farm. a beautiful view of the house, barns, river, fields and hills beyond. a gravestone stands in the shade of a single apple tree. it reads:}
<D>__{elizabeth putnam marion 1738 1773}
<A>__{above her name is a carving of the night sky, at the center of which is the north star, steady and guiding. marion approaches. he gives himself a moment to look at the grave, then he starts picking apples, speaking to the gravestone in a quiet voice that is more matter of fact than sorrowful.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{... and they bundled half... almost no trace of the boys you knew...}
<A>__{a soft wind blows some dry leaves along the ground. marion pauses as if listening to a spoken reply.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{... no, she still hasn't spoken... margaret was her age when you... i remember the time at the river when we couldn't find catherine... you couldn't stop crying... and she was asleep in the wagon the entire time...}
<A>__{marion pauses, remembering. the crash of a plate breaking, followed by the sound of an argument rises from the house below. marion shakes his head with an exasperated sigh.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{your children.}
<A>__{he heads down the hill toward the house, now glowing from the lights of candles and oil lamps.}
<L>__{interior marion's house evening}
<A>__{pre dinner chaos. everyone talking at once. marion's seven children and his two family servants, abigail and aaron, a middle aged black couple, prepare dinner. susan silently watches from the stairs. marion walks in.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i smell turnips...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{father, samuel broke the blue plate...}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{i did not...}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{dinner...}
<A>__{marion hands the apples to abigail and steps over to open his mail and dispatches.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{news of boston, father?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i hate turnips...}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{william knocked it right out of my hands...}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{father...?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{samuel, william, both of you clean it up...}
<A>__{marion hands a packet of pamphlets to gabriel and opens a letter.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{the assembly has been reconvened, i've been called to...}
<A>__{marion's children go wild.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{charleston!}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{we're going to charleston!}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{when, father, when?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{we'll leave tomorrow...}
<A>__{the children erupt into cheers and thunder into the dining room.}
<C>__{the children}
<D>__{charleston! we're going to charleston!}
<A>__{marion and gabriel exchange a stone faced look. then marion puts on a smile and inhales deeply.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i love turnips...}
<A>__{marion follows his children into the dining room.}
<L>__{exterior marion's house night}
<A>__{quiet. the only sounds are the soft calls of a few nightbirds and the drone of cicadas. a faint light moves through the downstairs, passing windows in the otherwise dark house.}
<L>__{interior marion's house night}
<A>__{marion, holding a candle, does a father's bedtime check. the camera follows him as he makes his rounds into: the kitchen. everything is clean and put away in its proper place. the main hallway. marion checks that the doors are closed and bolted. he heads up the stairs.}
<L>__{interior boys' bedroom night}
<A>__{marion enters, finding william asleep on the floor and nathan and samuel in bed. he lifts william into bed, takes a slingshot from nathan's hand, tucks in samuel and walks out.}
<L>__{interior girls' bedroom night}
<A>__{marion steps to the doorway, finding margaret and susan at the window, looking up at the night sky.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{... now count five finger lengths up from the front two stars of the big dipper, and that's the north star, that's her.}
<A>__{susan gazes up at the north star. the girls notice marion and climb into bed. he puts a chair against susan's bed and kisses her. he pulls a blanket up around margaret, who whispers:}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{it helps her to know mother's there.}
<A>__{marion nods with a thin smile, kisses margaret and walks out.}
<L>__{interior marion's study night}
<A>__{squadrons of lead soldiers stand ready for battle as thomas, lying on the floor, deploys his men. gabriel reads the new pamphlets and broadsides. marion walks in and pours a drink. gabriel hands several of the pamphlets to his father.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{the new york and rhode island assemblies have been dissolved...}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{the middle colonies?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{rioting both sides of the bay, in chestertown they burned the customs house and tar and feathered the customs agent. he died of burns. in wilmington they killed a royal magistrate and two redcoats.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{anything about the convention in philadelphia?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{poor richard says they'll make a declaration of independence by july.}
<A>__{marion shakes his head and sits down, carefully extracting a delicate pair of reading glasses from a wooden box. he begins reading.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{scott higgins joined the militia.}
<A>__{marion hears but doesn't respond. thomas looks up from his lead soldiers.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{he's seventeen. a year younger than i.}
<A>__{gabriel and thomas wait for a reaction. there is none. gabriel goes back to reading and thomas resumes playing with his toy soldiers. marion's eyes drift from the page to gabriel.}
<L>__{exterior swamp road day}
<A>__{the marion family, in two tightly packed carriages, drives on a beautiful road, cut through the swamps. the canopy of swamp maples and weeping willows forms a tunnel of green, mottled by sunlight.}
<L>__{exterior bennington overlook day}
<A>__{the two carriages pass a view of their entire valley. scattered farms with a patchwork of cultivated fields surrounding the town of bennington.}
<L>__{exterior santee road day}
<A>__{passing through rolling farmland, the marions head toward the coast. they pass a large contingent of south carolina militia, drilling in a field. the children, particularly gabriel, watch avidly.}
<L>__{exterior charleston day}
<A>__{a big, bustling city. marion and gabriel negotiate the carriages through the busy streets. the children watch, wide eyed, seeing taverns, a public gallows, drunkards, street entertainers, well dressed ladies attended by their maids, food venders, a man with a trained bear.}
<L>__{exterior charlotte's house charleston day}
<A>__{grand. four stories. marion and his children pull up. charlotte motte hurries out. she's in her mid thirties, beautiful, with a deep sadness that she keeps hidden as best she can. the children leap from the carriages and swarm around her, embracing her, smothering her with kisses.}
<C>__{the children}
<D>__{aunt charlotte! aunt charlotte!}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{welcome! welcome! margaret, william, look at you...!}
<P>__{(to marion)}
<D>__{they're huge. what have you been feeding them?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{they're from good stock on their mother's side.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{charlotte hustles the children toward the door.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{come, come, inside, wait until you see what i have...}
<C>__{the children}
<P>__{(simultaneous)}
<D>__{presents! for me? what do you have?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{inside, inside...}
<A>__{charlotte sweeps past marion who smiles and follows her into the house.}
<L>__{interior parlor charlotte's house day}
<A>__{marion watches as charlotte finishes handing out presents. susan plays with a new doll. william has half a dozen new spinning tops, skimming around the floor. margaret holds a new dress up to herself. samuel, nathan and thomas tear into packages holding platoons of lead soldiers. gabriel looks through a new book. charlotte sees marion watching her, rises and joins him at the doorway.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you look well, charlotte.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{as do you.}
<A>__{suddenly thomas and samuel race through the doorway, forcing marion and charlotte together, their bodies close. they step back and exchange warm but uneasy smiles. the moment is broken by the sound of children. marion and charlotte gratefully turn their attention back to them.}
<L>__{exterior charleston square night}
<A>__{down the block from the motte house. a yelling crowd of sons of liberty is massed around a liberty tree from which hang dozens of glowing lanterns. most of the men in the crowd are drunk. vendors sell rum, ale, food and banners emblazoned with a coiled snake and the legend, "don't tread on me." scores of on lookers, including respectable people, as well as street urchins, whores and drunkards, watch the proceedings. several sons of liberty string up effigies of king george iii and governor wilmington. they light the effigies on fire. as they begin to blaze, the crowd cheers.}
<L>__{exterior charlotte's balcony night}
<A>__{marion's children, except gabriel, stand on the balcony watching the mob. marion steps out onto the balcony.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{inside, all of you...}
<A>__{the children turn to marion with stricken expressions. marion relents.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{very well.}
<A>__{the children turn back to the mob. marion joins them.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{look! there's gabriel!}
<A>__{they see gabriel making his way through the crowd. he sees them and waves, then enters the house. a moment later charlotte steps out onto the balcony and sees: in the square, a pair of drunk sons of liberty, pull down one of the smoldering effigies, cut off its head, then start hacking at it's groin with a sword. appalled, charlotte shoots a glare at marion and snaps at the children.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{children, inside! all of you! right now.}
<A>__{the children start to protest, but a glance at charlotte's resolute expression makes them think better of it. they file into the house. charlotte shoots a glare at marion and shoos the children inside. gabriel steps out and joins them.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{what news?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{the british army is barricaded in boston. harry lee, is here from virginia, recruiting for a continental army.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{is that why the assembly was convened?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{yes. he seeks a levy of troops and money.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{and the governor?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{he vowed that if the assembly votes a single shilling to lee, he'll dissolve the body.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{which would force our delegates in philadelphia to vote for independence.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{and send us to war alongside massachusetts.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{our governor is a bigger fool than i thought.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{lee is counting on your vote and expects you to be the first to enlist.}
<A>__{marion nods thoughtfully without revealing what he thinks of lee's expectations. marion turns back to watch the mob.}
<L>__{exterior assembly hall charleston day}
<A>__{the capital building of south carolina. a large crowd of lower class men and women is massed in front of the assembly hall. as well dressed assemblymen walk into the building, the crowd yells words of encouragement to some and berates others. in the square in front of the assembly hall a squadron of blue uniformed american continental soldiers drills. a recruiting table is being set up by a continental captain and several military clerks. marion and gabriel walk across the square toward the assembly hall. as they push their way through the crowd, gabriel eyes the continentals.}
<L>__{interior assembly hall day}
<A>__{two dozen angry, yelling, men of property. among them are robinson, hamill and johnson, who are patriots. opposed to them are simms, withington and baldridge who are loyalists (loyal the the king). as marion makes his way to his seat, the speaker of the assembly pounds his gavel.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{order! order!}
<A>__{slowly, the room quiets down.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{our first order of business...}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{and out last if we vote a levy...}
<A>__{the room erupts.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{order! order! mr. simms, you do not have the floor.}
<A>__{the room settles down.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{our first order of business is an address by colonel harry lee of the continental army.}
<A>__{an imposing figure rises and makes his way to the front of the assembly. he's colonel harry lee, about marion's age and cut from the same cloth strong, weathered, with a powerful bearing. the room quiets down. lee sees marion and offers a familiar nod, which marion returns, stone faced. then lee speaks, simply and clearly.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{you all know why i am here. i am not an orator and i will not try to convince you of the worthiness of our cause. i am a soldier and we are at war and with the declaration of independence we all expect from philadelphia, it will soon be a formal state of war. in preparation for that, eight of the thirteen colonies have levied money in support of a continental army. i ask south carolina to be the ninth.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{colonel lee, massachusetts may be at war, along with new hampshire and rhode island and virginia, but south carolina is not at war.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{massachusetts and new hampshire are not as far from south carolina as you might think and the war they're fighting is not for independence of one or two colonies. it's for the independence of a nation.}
<C>__{withington}
<D>__{and what nation is that?}
<A>__{robinson, one of the patriots, stands up.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{an american nation. colonel lee, with your permission?}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{those of us who call ourselves patriots are not seeking to give birth to an american nation, but to protect one that already exists. it was born a hundred and seventy years ago at jamestown, virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested. we are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{thank you. were i an orator, those are the exact words i would have spoken.}
<A>__{laughter. marion rises.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{mister robinson, tell me, why should i trade one tyrant, three thousand miles away, for three thousand tyrants, one mile away?}
<A>__{laughter from the loyalists. surprise from lee and the patriots. in the gallery, gabriel winces.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{an elected legislature can trample a man's rights just as easily as a king can.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{captain marion, i understood you to be a patriot.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{it's mister marion.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i understood him to be a patriot as well.}
<A>__{more laughter.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{if you mean by a patriot, am i angry at the townsend acts and the stamp act? then i'm a patriot. and what of the navigation act? should i be permitted to sell my tobacco to the french traders on martinique? yes, and it's an intrusion into my affairs that i can't... legally.}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{and what of the greedy, self serving bastards who sit as magistrates on the admiralty court and have fined nearly every man in this room. should they be boxed about the ears and thrown onto the first ship back to england? i will do it myself.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and do i believe that the american colonies should stand as a separate, independent nation, free from the reins of king and parliament? i do, and if that makes a patriot, then i'm a patriot.}
<A>__{marion grows more serious.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{but if you're asking whether i'm willing to go to war with england, the answer is, no. i've been to war and i have no desire to do so again.}
<A>__{the room is quiet, the assemblymen having been thrown off balance. gabriel is stunned and disappointed by his father's speech.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{this from the same captain francis marion whose anger was so famous during the wilderness campaign.}
<A>__{marion glares at robinson, then smiles.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i was intemperate in my youth. my departed wife, god bless her soul, dampened that intemperance with the mantle of responsibility.}
<A>__{robinson looks derisively at marion.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{temperance can be a convenient disguise for fear.}
<A>__{marion bristles but before he can answer, lee steps in.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{mister robinson, i fought with captain marion in the french and indian war, including the wilderness campaign. we served as scouts under washington and i have no doubts about captain marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. there's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom i would more willingly trust my life.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{i stand corrected.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{nonetheless, i would like to know, mister marion, how... how... how...}
<A>__{lee's oratorical skills peter out.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{damn it, francis! how in god's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{harry, harry, harry...}
<A>__{marion and lee drop all formality and become nothing more than two old friends, pissed off.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{my hairy arse! you live in a cave if you think we'll get independence without war...}
<A>__{the speaker pounds his gavel.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{gentlemen! please! this is not a tavern!}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{wasn't it a union jack we fought under?}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{a long time ago...}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{thirteen years...}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{that's a damn long time...}
<A>__{the speaker pounds his gavel again.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{gentlemen! please!}
<A>__{marion and lee ignore the speaker.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you were an englishman then...}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{i was an american, i just didn't know it yet...}
<A>__{the astonished assemblymen and now even the speaker watch the argument avidly, turning their heads in simultaneous anticipation of each rejoinder.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{we don't have to go to war to gain independence...}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{balderdash!}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{there are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{name five hundred.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{that's five, keep going...}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{you said bribery twice...}
<A>__{marion speaks slowly and firmly.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{we do not have to go to war to gain independence.}
<A>__{lee says nothing for a moment, then he speaks more seriously, quietly, grimly.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{francis, i was at bunker hill. it was as bad as anything you and i saw on the frontier. worse than the slaughter at the ashuelot river. the british advanced three times and we killed over seven hundred of them at point blank range. and still, they advanced and they took the ground. that is the measure of their resolve. if your principles dictate independence, then war is the only way. it has come to that.}
<A>__{marion is silent for a long moment. he softens, finds himself unsteady and speaks far more honestly than he ever wanted to.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i have seven children. my wife is dead. who's to care for them if i go to war?}
<A>__{lee is stunned by marion's honesty and his show of weakness. at first lee has no answer, then:}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{wars are not fought only by childless men. a man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{that's what i'm doing. i will not fight and because i won't, i will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{and your principles?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i'm a parent, i don't have the luxury of principles.}
<A>__{the other assemblymen, both patriots and loyalists, stare at him, appalled. marion, feeling weak, sits down. lee looks at his friend with more sympathy than disappointment. then lee turns to robinson who addresses the chair.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{mister speaker, i call for a vote on a levy to the continental army.}
<C>__{hamill}
<D>__{second.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{so moved.}
<A>__{the vote is taken on a roll call. gabriel watches from the gallery.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{mr. robinson.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{yea.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{mr. hamill.}
<C>__{hamill}
<D>__{yea.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{mr. johnson.}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{yea.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{mr. simms.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{nay.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{mr. marion.}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{speaker}
<D>__{mr. marion.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{nay.}
<A>__{in the gallery gabriel turns and walks out. the roll call continues. marion sits, eyes straight ahead.}
<L>__{exterior assembly hall day}
<A>__{the crowd waits. the doors open and a page boy dashes out and runs to the continental captain at the recruiting table.}
<C>__{page boy}
<D>__{twenty eight to twelve, the levy passed!}
<A>__{the continental captain motions to an assembled squadron. they raise their muskets and fire a volley into the air. other soldiers, strike up a martial air on fifes and drums. volunteers crowd around the recruiting table, yelling and jostling for position. the delegates walk out. both patriots and loyalists give marion a wide berth. marion sees gabriel, standing near the crowd at the recruiting table. marion walks up to him.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{father, i've lost respect for you. i thought you were a man of principle.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{when you have children, i hope you'll understand.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{when i have children, i hope i don't hide behind them.}
<A>__{marion looks closely at gabriel.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{do you intend to enlist without my permission?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{they lock eyes for a moment, then gabriel turns from his father and walks away, joining the crush around the recruiting table. marion stands alone in the middle of the chaos. the fifes and drums continue to play. marion doesn't hear them. harry lee walks out of the assembly hall with a triumphant group of patriots who look at marion coldly. lee excuses himself, and steps over next to marion. lee sees that marion is watching gabriel at the enlistment table.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{one of yours?}
