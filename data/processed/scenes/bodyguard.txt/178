<L>__{exterior woods night}
<A>__{frank moves quickly through the woods, passes the splintered tree. we stay with him and hear the engine of a car roar to life and tires peel out of the dirt. frank breaks out of the woods in time to see the red lights at the back of the car as it fishtails around a bend. he empties his gun at it. we hear glass shattering, but the car keeps going.}
