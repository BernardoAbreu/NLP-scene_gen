<T>__{fade up on:}
<A>__{the humming stillness of an american suburb on a summer's day: nannies push strollers, joggers jog, mailmen deliver, dogs are walked, kids shoot hoop in wide open driveways. on a quiet, tree lined street we pick up two young athletic looking boys riding bikes. laser allgood (15) and his friend, clay (15). like bats out of hell they pass block after block of charming, evenly spaced houses until they round a corner and drop their bikes in front of a large ranch house.}
<L>__{interior clay's house moments later}
<A>__{they walk inside. we hear a baseball game on tv in another room.}
<L>__{interior clay's, bathroom later}
<A>__{clay pounds on blue pills with a hammer, reducing them to powder. laser watches.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{i don't know, dude.}
<A>__{clay cuts the powder into lines with a school id card.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{b minus in geometry, yo! this shits the bomb!}
<A>__{clay rolls up a dollar bill and takes a snort. then hands the rolled up bill to laser.}
<C>__{clay }
<D>__{add it up, son.}
<A>__{laser takes the bill, bends over and snorts a line.}
<L>__{interior allgood house girl's bedroom day}
<A>__{part oxford reading room, part teenage girl's lair. leaning against the bed we see joni allgood (18). it's her room. she pours over a game of scrabble. sitting next to joni is her best girl friend, sasha, (18). sasha's checking out joni's facebook page. joni's best guy friend, jai (18) sits across from her, calculating his next scrabble move.}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{oh my god, joni, there are so many hotties in your class. you are so gonna hook up the first week.}
<C>__{jai}
<D>__{just cause you're a 24 hour drive thru doesn't mean everyone else has to be...}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{hey, she worked her ass off! she deserves some hot jock sausage!}
<A>__{jai looks repulsed, and hurt.}
<C>__{sasha }
<P>__{(flip)}
<D>__{whatever. why don't you guys just do it and get it over with?}
<A>__{joni and jai blush. they're both too scared to admit their crush on each other.}
<C>__{sasha }
<D>__{what? i'm just asking.}
<C>__{jai}
<D>__{uh, maybe because we're friends...}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{oh, really...?}
<A>__{sasha turns to joni like an agent provocateur.}
<L>__{interior clay's house tv room later}
<A>__{laser and clay wrestle on the floor while clay's dad watches a baseball game on tv. they bump into the couch. clay's dad looks back, menacing.}
<C>__{clay's father}
<D>__{hey, ladies! take it down a notch.}
<A>__{the boys keep wrestling, wired from the pills. again, they knock into the couch. clay's dad spins around, pissed.}
<C>__{clay's father }
<D>__{what did i just say?!}
<A>__{the dad grabs clay, pulls him off of laser and over the couch. he gets his son in a headlock, forcing the boy's face into his big fat sweaty armpit. both dad and clay enjoy the brutal play. clay laughs manically.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{let me go!}
<C>__{clay's father}
<D>__{don't do the crime if you can't do the time.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{dad, your pits smell like burnt ass! get off me!}
<A>__{as laser observes this male bonding between father and son, we note a trace of longing on his face.}


<L>__{interior allgood house dining room}
<A>__{joni, laser and jules allgood (40's) fair skinned, attractive, sit before well prepared dinner. still buzzing, laser taps his fingers incessantly on the table.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{laser! knock it off!}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{what?! i'm not doing anything.}
<L>__{exterior house establishing magic hour}
<A>__{nic allgood (late 40's) pulls up into the driveway beside a beat up white truck covered in aa slogan bumper stickers.}

<A>__{nic enters. drops her bag and heads for the table.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{hi guys. sorry i'm late.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{don't worry. we just started.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{27 fibroids. all in the lining.}
<A>__{she kisses jules.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{honey, that's disgusting. we're eating.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{did you do that laparoscopically?}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{that's right, smart girl. and we got `em all.}
<A>__{as nic settles in...}
<C>__{nic }
<D>__{hey, whose truck is that?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{mine.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{yours?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{for the business.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{what business?..}
<P>__{(getting edgy)}
<D>__{the gardening?}
<C>__{joni}
<P>__{(protective)}
<D>__{isn't it landscaping.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{yes, thank you very much.}
<C>__{nic}
<P>__{(strained)}
<D>__{okay...}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{do we have any cabarnet left?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i didn't look, honey.}
<A>__{nic gets up and goes to the kitchen for wine. laser's cell phone rings. he answers it.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{hey, what's up?}
<A>__{jules puts her hand on laser's arm.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{laser, no phone calls at the table.}
<C>__{laser}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{lemme hit you back.}
<A>__{laser hangs up. nic re enters with a large glass of red.}
<C>__{nic}
<P>__{(sitting down)}
<D>__{who was that?}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{nobody. clay.}
<A>__{jules and nic share a look. jules starts making maternal windshield wiper strokes with her thumb on laser's arm.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{can i ask you something? what do you get from your relationship with clay?}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{what do you mean, "get"?}
<A>__{laser looks down at jules' thumb on his arm.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{do you feel like he's the kind of person who will help you grow?}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{mom, you're windshield wiping me.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{hey, did you start on those thank you notes for your birthday gifts?}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{not yet. but i will...}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{i just think it's easier to knock them out when it's fresh.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{yeah, i know, i will do them tonight.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{great...i mean, you don't want to have to start with an apology. you know? then it's embarrassing.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{okay, honey. she got it. let it go.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{okay, i will let it go...}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i mean, if it was up to you, our kids wouldn't even write thank you notes, they'd just send out good vibes.}
<A>__{nic takes another swig of vino and smiles at joni through increasingly plum stained teeth.}
<C>__{nic }
<D>__{i can't believe my baby's 18.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i know...}
<C>__{nic}
<P>__{(devolving into baby talk)}
<D>__{big girl. you're a big girl...}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{mom...}
<A>__{joni mimes wiping her teeth. embarrassed, nic starts licking at her stained teeth.}
<L>__{interior joni's bedroom later that night}
<A>__{as joni cranks out thank you notes, laser enters.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{laser looks nervous.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{have you thought any more about, you know, making that call...?}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{yeah. i don't want to.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{okay...i was just wondering if you changed your mind.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{i haven't.}
<A>__{he starts to leave, but her answer bugs him. he turns back.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{how can you not even be curious?}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{sorry, laser. i just don't want to, okay? i'm leaving soon and i don't want to deal with that right now.}
<P>__{(co dependent leak)}
<D>__{and also, that could really hurt moms' feelings...}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{god, why do you worry about them so much? they don't even have to know about it!}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{look, you can do it when you turn 18, okay?}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{i never ask you for anything.}
<A>__{laser walks out of the room. joni feels horrible.}
<L>__{interior nic and jules bedroom that night}
<A>__{nic and jules lay in bed watching tv, unwinding from the day.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{i just don't understand why you bought the truck now.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{because if i'm starting this business i need something to haul my equipment in.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{okay. it just seems a little cart before the horse.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{sweetie, you don't even have any clients yet.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{well you're the one who's always telling me to "act as if!"}
<C>__{nic}
<P>__{(back peddling)}
<D>__{that's true. i do. you're right.}
<A>__{the women settle back. nic sees jules feels bad.}
<C>__{nic }
<D>__{look, i'm sorry. it's good you bought the truck. its proactive.}
<A>__{nic caresses jules' arm, wanting to make it better.}
<C>__{nic }
<D>__{hey...}
<A>__{jules doesn't look at nic. she keeps her eyes on the t.v.}
<C>__{nic }
<D>__{wanna watch a movie?}
<A>__{jules perks up. nic immediately regrets her suggestion.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{a movie movie?}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{yeah. we haven't done that in a while.}
<A>__{minutes later nic and jules are cozied up side by side facing the tv. angle on the tv the volume is turned low on two naked men lying on a chaise longue. one guy fellating the other.}
<L>__{interior staircase same}
<A>__{joni tiptoes up a dark staircase and enters an office off the mom's bedroom. she heads for the desk and stealthy opens a drawer. she rummages though with clear intention. she pulls out a folder and studies the cover. we see the words: "pacific cryo clinic: bringing your dreams to life."}
<L>__{interior bedroom moments later}
<A>__{angle on the bed we now only see nic. jules has slipped under the blanket, and is now between nic's legs. we see nic trying to get into it, but having a hard time.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{i don't like the guys in this one. they're too shaved.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{don't focus on it.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{how about the one with the biker gang?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{we left it in hawaii.}
<A>__{jules wrestles with the blankets. wants them out of her way.}
<C>__{nic}
<P>__{(pulling them back up)}
<D>__{i'm cold, honey.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{sorry. i couldn't breathe.}
<A>__{jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner. the transition is awkward and jules gets caught in the top sheet. as nic repositions herself, she leans on the volume control button and suddenly the porn is blasting at full volume.}
<C>__{man in movie}
<D>__{suck that fat cock mother fucker...}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{shit!! where's the remote?!}
<C>__{man in movie}
<D>__{i'm gonna fuck that tight ass!...}
<A>__{jules and nic both dive for the remote. it's lost under the mass of bedding. they struggle to find it as the grunting and 70's disco music blares.}
<L>__{interior office joni}
<A>__{joni turns to the wall, confused. she hears the porno music pulsing though.}
<L>__{interior bedroom moments later}
<A>__{nic finally recovers the remote and hits mute.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{jesus christ!}
<A>__{nic flops back, traumatized.}
<C>__{nic }
<D>__{the whole neighborhood heard that!}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{no, they didn't.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{well, that was a vibe kill.}
<A>__{jules looks defeated.}
<L>__{interior office moments later}
<A>__{joni turns back to the file on the desk. she flips though some pages of documents and stops. close on a photo of a 4 year old boy standing in a sandbox looking straight into a camera with a big, open grin.}
<T>__{match cut to:}
<L>__{exterior farm day}
<A>__{we see that boy, 35 years later, carrying a box of tomatoes and putting them in the back of a truck. this is paul, joni and laser's biological father.}
<L>__{interior paul's restaurant "wysiwyg" day}
<A>__{paul walks in carrying the box of tomatoes. he approaches tanya, (30's) the restaurant's super sexy hostess.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{how you doing, foxy?}
<C>__{tanya}
<D>__{mm, flapjack, you're smelling ripe.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh, sorry...}
<C>__{tanya}
<D>__{no, i like it. it's earthy.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what can i say. i've just been out there, you know...hoe ing.}
<P>__{(looking at the seating chart)}
<D>__{how's it looking tonight?}
<A>__{they stand close to each other, peering at the chart.}
<C>__{tanya}
<D>__{gonna be tight.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{really...}
<A>__{paul's cell rings. he gives tanya a hand squeeze and heads for the kitchen, answering.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{hi, is this paul hatfield?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it is. who's this?}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{my name is wendy minter. i'm calling from the pacific cryobank.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{okay. what can i do for you?}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{i just need to confirm that you donated sperm with us between 1991 and 1993.}
<A>__{at the mention of the word sperm, paul goes pale.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah...i did a little bit of that back then...}
<L>__{interior kitchen continuous}
<A>__{paul enters. the kitchen is humming with cooks prepping for the dinner rush. he looks around for a quiet spot.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{as you know the cryobank has a confidentiality policy which prohibits us from releasing your identity without your consent.}
<A>__{a cook, margo, approaches paul to speak with him. paul nods: "can't talk." hands her the box of tomatoes.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{paul heads to the back of the kitchen, searching for privacy.}
<L>__{interior pantry same}
<A>__{paul moves into the pantry, finds the farthest corner.}
<C>__{wendy }
<D>__{well we've been contacted by a young woman conceived using your semen, and she's asked if you'd be open to having contact with her.}
<A>__{paul's speechless.}

<L>__{interior tanya's house bedroom night}
<A>__{paul and tanya enjoy a hot, sweaty fuck.}
<B>__{later that night}
<A>__{paul gets dressed while tanya lays on her messy bed.}
<C>__{tanya}
<D>__{you must of figured you'd get a call at some pointerior}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{not really. i mean i was 19 when i did it. it was so long ago...i just figured no one actually used my stuff.}
<A>__{tanya moves closer to him, flirty.}
<C>__{tanya}
<D>__{why? i'd use it.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(ignoring the innuendo)}
<D>__{this is so weird. i mean, a part of me's really curious...}
<C>__{tanya}
<D>__{so what are you gonna do?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<L>__{interior allgood house dining room}
<A>__{joni and jules play scrabble at the table. joni's cell rings. she grabs it off the counter and answers.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{hello?}
<L>__{exterior paul's house back yard day}
<A>__{paul anxiously paces his overgrown back yard on his cell phone. he picks weeds as he talks. conversation intercut.}

<C>__{joni}
<D>__{this is she...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hi. this is paul...}
<P>__{(clearing his throat)}
<D>__{uh, your donor...?}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{oh! hi...}
<A>__{joni shoots up out of her chair and starts leaving the room to get some privacy away from her mom.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{is this a good time to talk?}
<C>__{joni}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{where are you going? it's your turn.}
<A>__{joni doesn't answer. she just walks out to her backyard.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{so...}
<P>__{(doesn't know what to say)}
<D>__{how are you?}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{i'm good. how are you?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm well, thanks.}
<A>__{banal, awkward pause. paul jumps in to fill the void.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{so, wendy at the cryobank said you call }
<A>__{joni cuts in, nervous and businesslike.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{actually, my brother asked if i'd call you because i'm 18 and he's only 15 which is too young to call anyway, he'd like to meet you...if you want to...}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(thrown)}
<D>__{your brother?}

<D>__{i just don't want you to have big expectations.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{will you quit saying that? i don't have any expectations.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{okay. i'm just saying he might be weird. i mean, he donated sperm...}

<D>__{well if he hadn't done it, you wouldn't be here. so respect, yo!}
<L>__{interior "wysiwyg" day}
<A>__{paul sits alone at a table facing the entrance. he nervously checks the door as customers enter. minutes later joni and laser enter the restaurant. they look nervous too.}
<B>__{angle on paul}
<A>__{he studies them for a beat, sees them looking around. figures they must be "his kids." they look in his direction, spot him. he raises his hand, stands. they walk over. the moment is rife. paul holds out his hand to joni.}

<D>__{joni. hey. nice to meet you.}

<C>__{laser}
<D>__{i play some soccer. basketball. baseball. you know, team sports.}
<A>__{paul realizes he's put his foot in his mouth.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hey, i wasn't bagging teams in general. teams are great. i'm just weird like that.}

<D>__{yeah, i like teams.}
<A>__{we can tell laser is growing frustrated at his inability to connect with paul. joni jumps in.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{so this is your place?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah, i've been working on it for a while. i also have this organic co op farm down the road. we use a lot of the stuff we grow there for the restaurant.}
<C>__{joni}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{that's so cool. i'm totally into local.}
<C>__{laser}
<P>__{(busting her)}
<D>__{you are?}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{uh, yeah laser! i've been like trying to get moms to buy local for forever.}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no. no pigs...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but it's a great spot. you guys should come check it out sometime.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{yeah...definitely...}
<A>__{excited, joni turns to laser. he seems uninterested.}
<L>__{exterior wysiwyg, parking lot day}
<A>__{the kids and paul exit the restaurant. paul walks to a classic bmw motorcycle. lasers tries to hide his awe.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{is that yours?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah. you like motorcycles?}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{yeah, but...our moms are kind of anti motorcycle.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{and by "kind of" he means they'd kill us if we ever rode one.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's too bad. they're fun.}
<A>__{time to say goodbye. again, no one knows the protocol here. after an awkward beat, paul holds out his arms for hugs.}
