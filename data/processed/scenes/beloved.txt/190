<L>__{exterior a frozen creek day.}
<A>__{a bright, cold winter day. beloved wears a pair of old skates. denver wears the second pair and sethe has one skate and one shoe..the two girls giggle and fall as they try to skate on the ice... helping each other up. their skirts whirling...their laughter mingled with screams of delight. sethe, wearing only shoes, watches them and laughs.}

<D>__{come on, ma'am...try!}
<A>__{sethe steps onto the ice and takes a few strides and promptly falls on her rear. the girls scream with laughter. sethe tries to get up and falls, their laughter infecting her as well. the girls try to help her and fall over each other in the trying. denver rises and tries an independent glide. the tip of her skate hits a bump and she falls, flapping her arms wildly. all three laugh so hard, they start coughing. beloved goes to denver's aid. sethe rises up on her hands and knees, her laughter shaking her chest and causing her eyes to tear in the cold air. beloved helps denver, and falls as well. the two girls see sethe laughing and play it up even more, a few more times... until, denver notices something and motions beloved to stop and look. the two glide back to sethe. her laughter has stopped, but her tears have not... they gently, comfortingly, touch her shoulder.}
