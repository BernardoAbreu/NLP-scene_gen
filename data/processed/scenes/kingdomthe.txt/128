<A>__{the team sitting on the floor, below the window sills, away from the holes and doors. al ghazi standing, looking out the window at the spectacle. damon schmidt steps in: sees dead bodies and goes ghost, almost collapses. leavitt pops up, helps him sit.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{you need water?}
<A>__{a quick `no' nod: like the second before you lose lunch.}
<C>__{adam leavitt}
<D>__{you really ought not look at this.}
<C>__{damon schmidt}
<P>__{(pointing at the dead)}
<D>__{that fella got shot right through his god damn nipple...}
<C>__{janet mayes}
<D>__{don't stare too long. it'll start living in your dreams.}
<A>__{janet's voice causes schmidt to immediately force composure.}
<C>__{damon schmidt}
<D>__{no i know.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{you do?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how did you know we were here?}
<C>__{damon schmidt}
<D>__{the prince has men at al rahmah. colonel al ghazi what men?}
<C>__{damon schmidt}
<D>__{ask him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{3 vehicles will stay behind when the prince and press leave. you'll convoy straight to ba flights into dulles last minute fares come out of your budget, by the by. tried to swing upgrades, but check at the counter.}
<A>__{pissed, reproachful head shakes.}
<C>__{damon schmidt }
<P>__{(beat; color returning)}
<D>__{turn those frowns upside down, people. this will be pitched as a stunning saudi only counter punch that killed those responsible for al rahmah. al jazeera will play up an fbi presence, we'll play up their ties to terror as checkmate. and everyone that was so righteously pissed back home is gonna eat crow.}
<C>__{damon schmidt }
<D>__{already a rumor that the guy who wrote our state department memo }
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{ ellis leach?}
<C>__{damon schmidt}
<D>__{you know him? he's gonna be put out to pasture: made an example of by the president to ensure all levels of government get tough on terror.}
<P>__{(right at fleury)}
<D>__{you won the hand on the river card.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{we didn't win shit, schmidt. these are teenagers... children with pictures that someone far senior has provided them.}
<C>__{damon schmidt}
<D>__{ kidding me? you mean those are terrorist targets? holy wow. momma, don't let your children grow up to be cowboys.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just get ready to go home and revel in the fact that for the next few weeks your shit won't stink.}
<A>__{the phone rings that instant. leavitt hands it up to fleury. schmidt holds his hand up to janet: high five she gives it up slowly, warily, semi charmed:}
<C>__{damon schmidt }
<P>__{(to janet)}
<D>__{double or nothing that's a congratulatory call.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{hello?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yes, sir. we're all here and healthy. i'm sitting next to their corpses but this may not be over. these don't feel like anything resembling senior leadership }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ thank you sir. i do.}
<C>__{ronald fleury }
<D>__{please do me one favor before we board: warn every `coalition of the willing' or whatever the hell we're calling our iraq allies now, that pictures of their riyadh embassies were found in this cell's safe house.}
