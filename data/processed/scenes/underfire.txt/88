<L>__{exterior the luncheon day}
<A>__{as claire comes outside, there is a flurry of activity at the head table. two officers hastily set up an easel with a large military topographical map of nicaragua. a soldier takes the microphone from the singers the music grinds to an inglorious halt and carries it to the head table. price spots claire and makes a "what's all this about?" motion. claire holds out her palms and shrugs she doesn't know. all attention is quickly focused on the head table, as: president somoza makes a grand entrance flanked by hub kittle and an officer. he seems suddenly in unusually good spirits. hub taps the mike it works he motions for somoza to come forward.}
<C>__{somoza}
<D>__{my friends... this gathering was not intended to be a press conference as much as a... "get together"... but i have just been handed a piece of news.}
<A>__{somoza plays the moment with theatrical elan.}
<C>__{somoza}
<D>__{rafael is dead.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he has been killed in an ambush in the cordillera mountains of the jinotega district.}
<A>__{somoza points to a spot on the map as do his officer. the press table is shaken from its nonchalance and several journalists immediately leap to their feet to question him.}
<C>__{journalists}
<D>__{mr. president! mr. president!}
<C>__{somoza}
<D>__{please my friends no questions. a press release is being prepared.}
<A>__{somoza hands the mike to an aide who returns it to the music stand. almost immediately the music begins again. at the press table there is some confusion over the announcement. some journalists hurry off to file the story, others just sit. price seems alarmed by the announcement, confused. slightly wired, he listens to regis and other journalist discuss it.}
<C>__{other journalist}
<D>__{they got rafael? you believe that?}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{every six months tacho gives this speech maybe they finally lucked out.}
<A>__{claire tries to corner hub kittle who is heading back inside. hub disappears inside, claire pressing after him. jazy approaches price and leans in as if sharing a confidence. in the b.g. the luncheon is breaking up.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{russell, excuse me... but i've just been put in a rather embarrassing position.}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{mrs. somoza would like her picture taken with miss panama. in color?}
<A>__{price throws his camera bag over his shoulder, pulls out a camera, and follows jazy. they walk toward the head table.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{how the hell could tacho find rafael.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{russell, please... i have my hands full...}
<A>__{mrs. somoza and miss panama are waiting as price and jazy arrive. price is automatically switching camera lenses, but he continues to grill jazy.}
<C>__{mrs. somoza}
<D>__{tacho, tacho... venga, por favor!}
<A>__{price and jazy exchange glances as somoza reluctantly joins the portrait. somoza poses with his wife and his mistress on each arm as price flashes a light meter under their noses, then backs off to take the picture.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{is tacho lying again? they did kill him, didn't they?}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{everybody smile.}
<A>__{price takes a picture, somoza wants to leave and jazy would just as soon have this awkward moment over with, but:}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{one more, please! una mas, por favor?}
<A>__{reluctantly they pose again, and price grills jazy who is trapped.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{we help each other, right? could you move your girlfriend into the sun...}
<A>__{jazy moves miss panama slightly, returning to price.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{what do you need?}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{is rafael alive or dead?}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{price}
<P>__{(to the posers)}
<D>__{just one more thank you.}
<P>__{(to jazy)}
<D>__{i thought you knew everything?}
<A>__{as somoza holds an interminable pose, jazy launches into a speech, keeping his voice low enough so tacho cannot hear.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{what do i know, eh? tacho needs a victory very badly... he needs to prove to jimmy carter that he is still winning. he thinks rafael's death is the proof he needs.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{carter don't need proof. he just sent twenty five million in new arms to tacho.}
<P>__{(to posers)}
<D>__{i'm sorry... almost got it here.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{no, no... the arms shipment has been delayed in new orleans because jimmy is getting nervous.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{the state department's gonna pull the plug on tacho?! pardon my french but whose fucking side are you on?}
<A>__{jazy and price motion for the posers to move a step over.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{...i work for everybody. if there is a transition of power, i facilitate a relationship with the new people. if there is not, i facilitate the status quo.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{either way, i facilitate.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{great job.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{i send messages to jimmy and i tell him that the revolution is a flood that cannot be stopped but it can be controlled... nobody listens... i can't even get a little water in my pool.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{rough ain't it. thank you everybody, very nice.}
<A>__{price smiles to somoza, mrs. somoza, and miss panama. somoza hurries off from his uncomfortable position at last.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{i don't think rafael is dead. i'm gonna find him.}
<C>__{jazy}
<D>__{they say he's very handsome.}
<P>__{(beat)}
