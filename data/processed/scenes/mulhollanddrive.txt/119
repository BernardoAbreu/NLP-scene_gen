<C>__{betty}
<D>__{call the number.}
<A>__{betty reads the number off and rita pushes the corresponding buttons. each tone seems to be louder than the last. the ringing seems deafening. there's a click and the phone is answered by a machine. a woman's voice is heard loudly.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<P>__{(coming from answering machine)}
<D>__{hi ... this is me. leave me a message.}
<A>__{betty now has her ear pressed up against the phone also straining to hear everything. the machine starts recording. betty hangs up the phone immediately.}
