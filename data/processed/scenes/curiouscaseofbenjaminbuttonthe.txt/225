<L>__{interior hotel room, the caribbean hotel night, 1963}
<A>__{a white hotel room... the storm shutters closed... the wind and the rain banging at the shutters... daisy and benjamin lying together on a bed out of the storm... she touches his face as if for the first time...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{you barely have a line, a crease, or a wrinkle... everyday i have more wrinkles you have less...}
<A>__{he touches her face.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{i love your wrinkles.}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{what does it feel like growing younger?}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{i don't know... i'm always looking out of my own eyes...}
<A>__{they're quiet, just the sound of the rain and the chattering shutters... she lays closer to him... warmly... she smiles...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{will you still love me when i can't stand straight... when my skin grows old and spotted...}
<A>__{benjamin laughs.}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{will you still love me when my step gets slow... when i sleep too much... when you have to push me in a chair...}
<A>__{and his answer is...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{will you still love me when i have pimples. when i think it's funny to make fart noises...}
<A>__{she laughs...}
<C>__{benjamin }
<D>__{will you still love me when i think all girls have cooties... will you still love me when i wet my bed at night... will you still love me when i'm afraid of things that aren't real...}
<A>__{they hold each other... and benjamin says... from what he's seen...}
<C>__{benjamin }
<D>__{nothing lasts...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{maybe some things last...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{i've never seen anything not come to an end...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{maybe it's something you can't see...}
<A>__{and a shutter slams open... the rain and the wind coming into the room... benjamin gets up to close it... he comes back into bed... and daisy, suddenly afraid...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{i'm cold, benjamin...}
<A>__{and as he holds her in the white room with the wind and the rain trying to get in, banging on the shutters...}
