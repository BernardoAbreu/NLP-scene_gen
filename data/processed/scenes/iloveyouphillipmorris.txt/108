<L>__{interior houston judge's chambers, 1995 day}
<A>__{the lawyer sits impatiently while steven peruses a wall of plaques, photos and diplomas. he focuses on a law school degree from indiana college of law. next to it, a photo of the judge as a young man on a farm. he's from humble roots. a moment later, the judge enters.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{okay gentlemen, let's get this over with, the two for one at the crab boiler ends at five o'clock.}
<C>__{lawyer}
<D>__{this seems to be cut and dried here, sir. i don't even know why we're back here. mister russell is treating this like an episode of matlock.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i will admit your honor i'm a plain spoken man. i didn't go to princeton. i didn't go to yale. my education was modest. i went to a small school. i grew up on a small farm. but i passed the same bar exam as my colleague here and i am not going to let him push around this humble woman.}
<A>__{this scores with the judge.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{point taken mister russell...}
<A>__{he glares at the other lawyer with scorn.}
<C>__{judge }
<D>__{...but where are you going with this?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i think it's obvious where i'm going with this sir.}
<A>__{a long silence. the judge waits and waits until something occurs to him.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{are you talking about marshall vs. chao?}
<A>__{steven doesn't know what this means... but the other lawyer does. and he's not happy.}
<C>__{lawyer}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{shit...}
<A>__{seeing this, steven puffs with confidence.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{your honor, that's exactly what i'm talking about.}
<A>__{the judge slowly nods to himself as he considers this.}
