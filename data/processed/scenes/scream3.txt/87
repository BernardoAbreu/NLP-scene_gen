<L>__{exterior studio lot day}
<A>__{sidney comes charging around the corner of the soundstage building. she looks up, realizing she's just ran herself into a dead end.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{bam! an exit door flies open. the ghost comes charging out. sidney screams, runs for a wooden fence. she begins to scale it, dropping over on the other side just as the killer pierces through it with his knife. sid takes off running for wallace and dewey. wallace and dewey, hearing the screams, spin around, drawing out their guns. wallace looks at dewey.}
<C>__{dewey}
<P>__{(re:gun)}

<C>__{detective wallace}
<D>__{wait a second? killers? there's two of them now? aw shit!}
<A>__{wallace whips out his cellular, dials a number. sidney falls into dewey's arms, collapsing like a house of cards, crying hysterically.}
<C>__{detective wallace}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yeah this is wallace. we got a problem down here on the sunrise studios lot. no not another one. at least not yet. yeah we've had an attack.}

<C>__{gale}
<D>__{dew!}
<A>__{dewey and sidney turn around to see an excited jennifer and gale race into frame.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{sidney, what happened?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{nevermind, what'd you two find?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{we did some researching in the archives. sid, something dawned on me when i wrote the book on your mother's murder. for two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the earth.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
