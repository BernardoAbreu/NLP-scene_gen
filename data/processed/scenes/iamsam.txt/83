<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{dr. donovan, an attractive soft spoken woman is on the stand. rita is working the room. sam, having a hard time concentrating, is following a crack up the wall and onto the ceiling.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{dr. donovan, the american medical journal named you one of the country's leading oncologists. isn't that correct?}
<C>__{dr. donovan}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{what kept you going the twelve years you were in medical school?}
<C>__{dr. donovan}
<D>__{caffeine. sugar. and my mother's confidence in me.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i wish i had a mother like that. she must have been smart.}
<C>__{dr. donovan}
<D>__{she had great instincts.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{do you have any idea what her iq was?}
<C>__{dr. donovan}
<D>__{in the lower ranges. about eighty.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{so your mother, this woman with the iq of a nine year old had the wisdom to recognize that you would be a great doctor. i guess her disability didn't seem to hold you back in life.}
<C>__{dr. donovan}
<D>__{no. my mother's condition taught me what they can't teach you; compassion and patience.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{traits most doctors have in spades. thank you, no further questions.}
<A>__{sam runs to hug dr. donovan, bumping into rita who sits him down.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{how'd you get through medical school? where'd you live?}
<C>__{dr. donovan}
<D>__{we lived with my mother's parents.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{oh, grandma and grandpa. would it be fair to say your grandparents were of normal intelligence?}
<C>__{dr. donovan}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{and didn't these people your grandparents with normal intelligence have the real responsibilities?}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(relishing this)}
<D>__{objection! i hear mr. turner's mother in law lives with him! she must help out. does that mean he doesn't have the real }
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{motion to strike that from the record. irrelevant, immaterial and immature }
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{irrelevant?! any parent has a right to a support system.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{i'm not talking about the rights of the parent, i'm talking about the rights of a child.}
<P>__{(the gavel bangs)}
<D>__{i'm talking about entrusting an eight year old's welfare in the hands of someone whose records show he was diagnosed with infantile autism, mental retardation...}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{objection! motion to strike that from the record. it's clear that one's intellectual capacity has no bearing on their ability to love. you honor, would you please instruct council to proceed with a modicum of sensitivity?}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{oh, i'm sensitive. i'm real sensitive when i see people like you }
<P>__{(the gavel bangs!)}
<D>__{come here and try to give meaning to your life by screwing up somebody else's!}
<C>__{judge mcneily}
<D>__{that's enough. both lawyers approach the bench!}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(both approach)}
<D>__{and i suppose tearing apart a family is truly noble work, mr. turner.}
<C>__{judge mcneily}
<D>__{that's it. i fine you both for contempt. two hundred fifty dollars.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{what's that to her? she gets that for picking up the phone.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{oh, that's what this is about.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{i will tell you what this is about. see this is an award for you at some luncheon. but i'm here everyday.}
<P>__{(gavel pounds again)}
<D>__{you win, you're out the door. but guess who i see come back? the kid. most of the time, in less than a year. only now it's too late. so you're right. i'm real sensitive. you can't even touch that area.}
<B>__{on sam}
<A>__{devastated.}
