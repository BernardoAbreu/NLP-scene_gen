<L>__{interior living room kitchen morning}
<A>__{door opens. dick enters. finding the guitarist in the kitchen, he clicks into time tested road managerial maintenance. easing russell out of his towel, slipping his own jacket around him, from russell's hands.}
<C>__{dick}
<P>__{(privately)}
<D>__{they've been crying for you like a bunch of whimpering pussies }
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(woozy)}
<D>__{the band is over. this is my family now.}
<C>__{others}
<D>__{right on. he's staying with us.}
<C>__{dick}
<P>__{(soothing)}
<D>__{definitely. it's all over. we'll just ride on to greenville, listen to some great music, finish the tour, and leave those ungrateful fools behind. and then we'll come back here, where you'll live.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{i know what you're doing... and i like it.}
<P>__{(noticing william)}
<D>__{look at him. he's taking notes with his eyes.}
<P>__{(beat, to dick)}
<D>__{how do we know he's not a cop?}
<A>__{william laughs painfully, as russell moves in, eyes flaring with sudden paranoia.}
<D>__{russell (cont'd) he could be selling information!}
<C>__{dick}
<P>__{(to russell)}
<D>__{easy. he's your guardian angel.}
<A>__{russell turns away. william shrugs with style, but his lingering look is filled with hurt. dick guides russell to the door, grabbing the kid and talking very directly to him as they move.}
<C>__{dick }
<D>__{don't worry. he only means half of what he says.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{which half?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{good question.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(very direct)}
<D>__{i have a lot more. just help me get my interview so i can go home from greenville. i have to go home.}
<P>__{(pulls him back) i have to go home.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{hey. you saved the tour. that's good enough for now.}
<A>__{frustrated but feeling important, william hands him some of russell's wet clothes. william deftly retrieves russell's shoes and smoothly plucks the guitarist's sunglasses from the partygoer who also wears his belt. they move to the door in a pack. we hear the beginning of elton john's "tiny dancer." dick faces the crowd and addresses them in his "important" stage voice.}
<C>__{dick }
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, the evening is over! we hope you've enjoyed yourselves, and we'll see you again in 1974!! good evening!!}
<A>__{william gives russell his sunglasses to face the sunlight. russell stumbles out of the house to great cheers. the quiet girl breaks free to catch russell on the way out.}
<C>__{quiet girl}
<D>__{i will never forget you.}
<A>__{dick pats william's arm one more time good work. they leave aaron's house as legends.}
