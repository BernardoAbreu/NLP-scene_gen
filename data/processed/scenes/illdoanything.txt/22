<L>__{exterior parking lot day}
<A>__{matt drives his faded, seven year old car into view.}
<L>__{interior exterior matt's car early evening}
<A>__{he looks off... sees something that arrests his interest and pulls to the curb. it's a curious sight. matt's pov burke adler, standing at a street corner, palpably in pain. he's trying to rein in his emotions, sucking in huge gulps of air... and, then, a wave of emotion gets the better of him as he looks at his watch. a sob escapes him shocked that he's so close to tears on a public street corner, he battles for control... another sob as he looks to the heavens.}
<B>__{on matt}
<A>__{a split second to consider, then he's out of his car. full shot the street corner a flow of people in the foreground, the tortured figure of burke adler in the background, matt hobbs, pauses before intruding. but burke's spectacle is growing more public, sounds of anguish escape him. closer shot burke}

<D>__{oh, god... why? why?...}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{what am i going to do?}

<D>__{i'm right over here.}
<A>__{matt starts to lead him back, then realizes he's alone, burke having seen his car finally arrive. matt's pov burke, berating the young driver. matt pauses, awed by the wild gesticulating the few screamed words...}
<C>__{burke }
<D>__{...not just today... believe me, there's no way you'll ever make it... you are going to fail. listen, listen i know about this; you are going to be a failure.}
