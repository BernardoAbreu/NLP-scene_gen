<L>__{exterior campfire night}
<A>__{a campfire amidst several large boulders, a line of windmills on the horizon. tamara struggles to manage a cooking pot over a blaze. conan comes over and smells the pot; his face scrunches from the odor.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{trying to poison me?}
<A>__{tamara steps back and gets down on her knees, her hands clasped.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{before we eat, i must pray.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{crom! what would you pray for? that a bone may not get stuck in your throat? no words nor gods will give you one more moment than fate allows you.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{then you have no faith. and i am sorry for you.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{i need no pity.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{but you do. you live in a world that is harsh and short. where fate is unyielding and hope is a cruel joke. i live in a world with a purpose that guides me, where faith sustains me.}
<A>__{suddenly, conan kicks dirt past tamara, onto the fire. the fire goes out, plunging everything into darkness.}
<C>__{tamara }
<D>__{why did you }
<A>__{suddenly, there's the sound of fighting. grunting, blows being interchanged, then a loud snap as bones are broken. a moment later, the flames of the fire are stoked up again, revealing conan standing over the groaning remo. the other two shadow scouts are dead. tamara instinctively jumps back.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{don't worry. his back is broken. he won't be slinking away this time.}
<A>__{as tamara gapes at remo, conan simply pulls the cooking pot off the fire.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{now, let's eat.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{but what about him?!}
<A>__{remo groans in pain.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{i enjoy a little music with my meal.}
