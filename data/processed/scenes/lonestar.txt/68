<L>__{exterior drive in movie night}
<A>__{it is 1972. an early '70s cheezy action picture (filipino women in chains or biker flick is playing. we tilt down to a man's boots crunching across the gravel of the parking area. now and then, the man turns a flashlight beam on a license plate. the cars are all pre '72, lots of pickups, and the patrons are almost all teenagers. some have turned their pickups around to sit on the tailgate and watch, while others have set lawn furniture out to sit on. we tilt up slightly to see the glint of a rio county sheriff's badge pinned on the man's shirt. he meets a deputy coming in the other direction. both train their flashlights on the license of the car we see in the b.g. between them. we tilt and rack to see that nobody is visible through the window }

<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{we follow buddy up to the driver's side of the car as the deputy goes to the passenger side. we pan with buddy's hand down to the door handle he grabs it, flings it open the overhead light flicks on and there lie young sam and pilar, teenagers, half their clothes off and just about to close the deal. pilar screams and the deputy throws the door open by their heads }
