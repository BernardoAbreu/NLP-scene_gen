<L>__{interior bar night}
<A>__{it's late. it's dim. it's as romantic as urban newfoundland will ever get. our couple nursing beers at the corner table of a passably stylish bar. piano playing show tunes, but soft. he pulls from his pocket... ...a travel brochure. slightly drunk, completely merry, almost wicked smile.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{now, listen to this for t'morrow. after i sign the papers at the home...}
<A>__{she's already grinning. feels so comfortable.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{the answer to your annual outing! rainbow trout fishing in four ponds. you pay for what you catch. prizes in the ponds. if it drizzles or gets chilly, heated and lighted building available, right next to the ponds, with soft drinks, candy bars, ice cream and chips!}
<A>__{his subtle smile. a guy could get used to this irony stuff.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{or we could sleep in.}
<A>__{...innocent, natural. at some primal level, his panic begins.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{i just feel so guilty about all your expenses. two separate rooms. both so big.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{hey, it's my treat. you agreed.}
<A>__{she nods. she did.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{still. seems like we could figure out. something.}
<A>__{even quoyle. has the message. he looks down at his beer, as he thinks about what he should say. turns the glass in his fingers.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{a friend told me once. love is the only thing that counts.}
<A>__{he nods. almost to himself.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{it's the engine of life.}
<A>__{he looks up. her eyes are waiting.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{so when you told me how you think about your husband. i really understood, becau...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{that's what i wanted us to talk abou...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{...because real love. just comes once.}
<A>__{and everything. stops.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{see, you know some of the stories about petal. some of the bad things. what you don't know...}
<A>__{but she's looking in his eyes. and so, she does.}
<C>__{wavey }
<D>__{...is how much you love her.}
<A>__{that's what it is.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{even tho. she never loved you.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{sorta. because of it.}
<A>__{he sighs. the most miserable and the most honest he has ever been. all at once.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{see, love. isn't about what's good for you. isn't about what you wish it was. isn't about what...would make you happy.}
<A>__{his eyes are swimming. can she possibly hear this?}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{love. is about want. what you really want. and you can't change that. even if it's poison.}
<A>__{silence. the piano plays something gay and stupid.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{so that's why it's great. to have a real friend. when you're. lonely.}
<A>__{the last word was a tough one. it makes her nod. she stares in his eyes for the longest time. and when she speaks, he can scarely hear her voice...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{i know you have to stay tomorrow. to sign the papers. but.}
<A>__{but. one word. and even a stupid guy. gets it all.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{i should be heading back. before herry. misses me. too much.}
<A>__{wow. he nods, dumbly. watching his worst nightmare unfold before his eyes.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{and i'm not feeling so well. what i get for mixing vodka and beer, huh.}
<A>__{she gets to her feet. she does seem a little unsteady.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{so i will grab a taxi. you stay and finish. listen to the music. is that all right?}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{i cou...}
<A>__{but he stops. because she's shaken her head once. don't.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{and don't worry. i'm still your friend.}
<A>__{her voice chokes a little on that. she shakes her head, half grinning at how foolish she feels. she smiles at him now. like she means it. and leaves. without another word.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{she did stay my friend. in her way. even tho, for awhile, we didn't see each other a lot.}
<A>__{he wants to cry. he wants to be sick. he doesn't know what he wants. fumbles in his pocket for some wadded up bills.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{funny. how one little talk. can change everything.}
