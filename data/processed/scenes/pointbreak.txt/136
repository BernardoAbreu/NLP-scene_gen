<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior cessna}
<A>__{utah sits, wearing a day glo jump suit, hugging the chute in his lap. next to him is the gaping door. beyond... a spectacular down sunburst at 10,000 feet. roar of wind and engines. utah watches bodhi, nathaniel, grommet and roach wriggling into their colorful freefall suits. nathaniel pulls on a pair of purple shorts over his suit. looks real dorky. grommet has on duck feet. bodhi, apparently, is going to jump barefoot. nobody has their chutes on yet. johnny hefts his, as if weighing it, somehow judging the contents. his brain is racing. bodhi shouts over the roar.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{it's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer. one last speedstar.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{so, who... uh, who packed my chute?}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{i did. what's the matter? don't trust me?}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{you gotta earn trust.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{then we'll earn it together. here, take mine.}
<A>__{bodhi swaps chutes with johnny. utah looks at the new chute uncertainly. is this a game? poker moves? did bodhi anticipate this step?}
<C>__{roach}
<D>__{hey... you don't want bodhi's, man. his pack jobs suck... they only open half the time. take grommet's, man.}
<A>__{roach's grin is evil as he grabs grommet's chute out of his hands and switches it with johnny's. keeps that one and gives his to grommet.}
<C>__{grommet}
<D>__{whoa, unfair, dude!}
<A>__{grommet grabs his chute back and hands johnny the one he had, which was roach's. i think. johnny looks at the pack in his hands. then at the grinning faces. russian surfer freefall roulette. shit. bodhi studying him. some kind of test. fuck it. utah starts putting the damn thing on.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{we gonna jump or jerk off?}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{my man!}
