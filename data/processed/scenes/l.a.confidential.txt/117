<L>__{interior forensics lab day}
<A>__{ray pinker looks up from his microscope as bud enters.}
<C>__{pinker}
<D>__{bud white, what brings you down to the basement?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i got a few nite owl questions.}
<C>__{pinker}
<D>__{i don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i'm tying up loose ends. padding my report. you know how it goes.}
<C>__{pinker}
<D>__{what do you want to know?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{anything off. anything that didn't make sense.}
<C>__{pinker}
<D>__{you mean beside the fact that thirty five out of forty five rounds were gratuitous? i can't think of anything.}
<A>__{pinker is ticked as bud steps over to where a group of nite owl crime scene photos are posted on the wall. bud pauses at a photo which shows the floor around the table. we see a high heel shoe, blood smears across the floor.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{whose shoe?}
<C>__{pinker}
<D>__{susan lefferts.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{if she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way. what are these smears in the blood?}
<C>__{pinker}
<D>__{it looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{but she's moving away from the door.}
<P>__{(thinks; points)}
<D>__{who was sitting at this table?}
<C>__{pinker}
<D>__{dick stensland.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{had to be dumb panic. if she knew him she would've been sitting with him... right?}
<A>__{bud wonders, maybe a puzzle piece just fell into place. pinker remembers something.}
<C>__{pinker}
<D>__{you know, there is one thing.}
<A>__{pinker rummages a shelf for a glass jar which he hands bud. inside are two wax saturated cotton balls.}
<C>__{pinker}
<D>__{cotton balls. i found them just inside the meat locker door. bud ear plugs .}
<C>__{pinker}
<D>__{exactly. at least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{it doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.}
<C>__{pinker}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{it's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...}
<C>__{pinker}
<D>__{yeah, so...}
<A>__{bud just stares at the picture of susan lefferts.}
