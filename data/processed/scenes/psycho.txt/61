<P>__{(without waiting for her response)}
<D>__{will you have supper here? i was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but i'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... i don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'd like to.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{all right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and i will come for you soon as it's ready...}

<P>__{(he laughs a small laugh, runs off)}
<A>__{mary closes the door, goes to suitcase, opens it, starts to take out a dress. her handbag is next to the suitcase. she glances down into it, pauses, drops the dress, reaches into the handbag, takes out the money filled envelope, stares at it, almost with regret, filled contemplates hiding it, decides to, starts looking for a reasonable hiding place. she looks about, at the closet, the drawers etc., realizes all such places are obvious. catching sight of the newspaper in her bag, she hits on a solution. she opens the newspaper, places the envelope within it, lock folds the paper again and then places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later reading. she considers this for a moment, accepts it, goes to her suitcase to start unpacking. suddenly the quiet is shattered by the shrill, ugly sound of a woman's voice, raised in anger.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{no! i tell you no!}
<A>__{mary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible voice is coming from the house behind the cabins. camera follows her to window and once there we see the light is still on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming from that room. the rain has stopped and the moon is out.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{i won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...}
<P>__{(an ugly, sneering}
<D>__{note creeps into the}
<P>__{voice)}
<D>__{...by candlelight, i suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!}
<C>__{norman's voice}
<D>__{mother, please...}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{and then what? after supper, music? whispers?}
<C>__{norman's voice}
<D>__{mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<P>__{(mimicking cruelly)}
<D>__{mother, she's just a stranger!}
<P>__{(hard, cruel again)}
<D>__{as if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, i refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! you understand, boy?}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! or do i have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? huh, boy? you have the guts, boy?}
<C>__{norman's voice}
<P>__{(blurted cut fury and shame)}
<D>__{shut up! shut up!}
<A>__{there is the sound of a door closing in that room up there. mary has stood by the window, listening with mounting distress and concern and sympathy. she turns her face away now, gazes sadly at the little empty room. in a moment there is the sound of the house's front door slamming shut. mary turns, looks out the window. from mary's viewpoint (night) we see norman coming down the path, carrying a napkin covered tray.}
