<A>__{gideon looks over at the chickens, scratching around in the garden. he calls to them, but they don't respond. he puts his shoes on and walks towards the back door of the house. entering the house, he stops and waits inside the door peeping out. in a sort of devilish manner he talks to himself.}

<A>__{shot of the backyard. nothing. suddenly, with the grace and suspicion of alley cats, kids jump over gideon's back fence, look around timidly, and start climbing up his fruit tree. gideon walks down the steps slowly while humming in a deep voice. he turns the water on and walks over to the tree, trapping the kids. dangling legs, hanging from the tree, try to scurry up the tree to safety. gideon sprays the tree with water. wet kids fall out of the tree and in one motion leap the fence. gideon cuts the water off and slaps the dirt off his hands. he is quite pleased with himself.}
