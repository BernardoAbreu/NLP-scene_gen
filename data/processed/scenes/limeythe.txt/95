<T>__{cut:}
<L>__{exterior wilson's motel. morning.}
<A>__{early.}
<L>__{interior wilson's room.}
<A>__{wilson and elaine. getting dressed. she's in pantyhose. fastening a bra. he's got trousers on, reaching for a shirt.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{how long've you lived here?}
<A>__{elaine sits on the bed, fastening her skirt. her bra strap cuts across her bare back.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{this town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."}
<P>__{(thinks back)}
<D>__{christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{early 70's. i was away.}
<P>__{(tries to remember)}
<D>__{maidstone. possibly brixton.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{these more highlights from the zagat prison guide?}
<A>__{wilson looks at her: she's the one who goes to bed with ex cons.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{you don't seem bothered.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{you don't know how i've compromised my standards.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{tell us about it.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{it's too involved; a lifetime of non involvement. anywhere else i'd be an interesting little number, here i'm just sag number forty eight thousand and one.}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{sag meaning screen actor's guild.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{oh, i was gonna say ...}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{still, there have been rewards. it's sunny. and some of the producers who call even have credits.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{i can see the attraction.}
<A>__{she glances up at him to try and see how he means that. is he looking at her or out the window?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{what did you do? to make them take the early 70's away from you.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{a jeweller's up the west end. we tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. filthy work. trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed after we'd made the grab, 'n all. would you adam n' eve it.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{you mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{we were lucky to be nicked. me and the lads went down there sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the monday. good job we were still breathing.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{it didn't discourage you, though.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{hey?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{from pursuing your chosen profession.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{i will tell ya something: it made me a model prisoner. put me right off any escape attempts. tunnel my way to freedom after that experience? not bloody likely.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i was inside once. i punched a cop at a demo.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{did you. what was that in aid of?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{who remembers.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{get seven years, did you?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{overnight. what about just now?}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{just now?}
<P>__{(playful, goes over, ready for more)}
<D>__{overnight?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{you have been away.}
<P>__{(lies back, regards him carefully)}
<D>__{or is all this just new to you?}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{it's true. has to be said. i got off to a slow start.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i don't believe it.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{honest. didn't know where to look till i was 21.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{pushing the legal limit even then.}
<A>__{he stands again, vaguely disappointing her.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{me mate introduced me to a woman up the street. funnily enough, she was married to a milkman. straight up. i said, "good is she? been around?" he said, " good ? listen, mush, it's not that she's been around, it's that she's been around hell of a long time."}
<A>__{he laughs uproariously at that. but the point is: he's sort of complimenting both elaine and himself. they've been around, had their knocks, they've lasted. elaine remains unsmiling. still leaning back on her elbows on the bed, in bra, skirt, hose, no shoes. she asks again the question wilson avoided answering.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{your most recent incarceration. what was that for?}
<A>__{and again he evades the answer she wants.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{it was for nine years.}
<P>__{(buttoning his shirt)}
<D>__{the last nine years.}
