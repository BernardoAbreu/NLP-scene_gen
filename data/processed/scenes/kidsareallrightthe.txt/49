<L>__{interior joni's room day}
<A>__{jai and joni and sasha play scrabble. sasha checks out the photos of paul on joni's phone.}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{hello? donor dad? stone cold fox.}
<C>__{jai}
<D>__{must you take everything beautiful and make it dirty?}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{i'm just saying. spermster's a hottie. is he single?}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{okay, first of all, ewww. second, he's a really good person and i'd prefer it if you didn't taint him with your whore juice.}
<A>__{sasha hops up, energized by the banter.}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{fair enough, hairy muff. i'm outta here. you love birds can split my letters...}
<A>__{sasha splits and suddenly the room is thick with nervous tension.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{you want to keep playing?}
<C>__{jai}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{as jai incorporates sasha's tiles into his own, we see joni gathering her nerve to make a move. jai probably feels it but in his nervousness he can't look at joni.}
<C>__{jai }
<D>__{sometimes i feel sorry for sasha, you know...}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{joni starts to move in, her face draws closer to jai's, inch by inch. somehow, deep down, jai can sense her moving towards him which exhilarates and freaks the shit out of him at the same time. to the point where he lets slip...}
<C>__{jai}
<D>__{it's like she has to sexualize every experience, you know? it's just sad...}
<A>__{that stops joni in her tracks.}
<C>__{joni}
<D>__{yeah, it is. it's really sad.}
<A>__{jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it.}
