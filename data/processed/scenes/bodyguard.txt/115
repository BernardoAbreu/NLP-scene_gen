<A>__{frank walks to the bar taking a drink from his glass. he looks in the mirror behind the bar and sees rachel and portman in the hall outside her bedroom. she turns her head to look directly at frank's reflected face. assured that frank is watching, she takes portman's hand and leads him into her room. frank sets his glass down and the bartender refills it with orange juice. a stunning woman in green glides down the bar and stands very close to frank.}
