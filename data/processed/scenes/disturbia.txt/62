<A>__{ashley smiles. they suddenly hear voices o.s. kale and ashley glance over to giles' house. their pov the woman is heading briskly to her car. giles is right behind her. ashley grabs kale's arm and pulls him behind a shrub on his side of the boundary. they peek back over to giles'. their pov we're crouched low now, so we only hear the barely audible voices of giles and the woman. talking seriously about something }
<C>__{giles}
<P>__{(voice raising)}
<D>__{just come back in the house, you shouldn't drive }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{he wants her to come back in }
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{i can't hear }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{let's get closer }
<A>__{ashley suddenly darts from behind the shrub and bolts toward the fence }
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(re: his bracelet)}
<D>__{i can't }
<A>__{but ashley keeps going. we follow behind ashley she creeps over to the fence, presses up against it, peering through the cracks ashley's pov we see the dark silhouettes of giles and the woman ashley shifts her head, straining to listen }
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{you really should stay.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i just don't think it's a good idea }
<P>__{(still searching; more frustrated)}
<D>__{where the hell are they?}
<A>__{the woman suddenly drops her purse. the contents spill onto the driveway. ashley's pov giles bends down, picks up her car keys.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{here }
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{you're in no condition }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{give me my keys.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{ashley's pov she sees giles make a motion toward the fence. suddenly, the woman's car keys whack the other side of the fence, then plop down underneath it just a couple of feet from ashley's position! on ashley she startles, looks over, sees the keys. ashley's pov she looks back toward giles and the woman. hears the woman start to laugh. giles, not laughing, purposefully steps toward the woman, takes her arm.}
<C>__{giles }
<D>__{c'mon...}
<A>__{ashley's pov the woman relents. giles helps her back toward the house. with kale he's seeing it all.}
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{ashley, come on...}
<A>__{with ashley she glances down, eyes the car keys sparkling in the moonlight. she scoots toward them as we crane up to reveal giles heading back toward the fence! on kale seeing this. kale tries to get ashley's attention, but she's not looking cu ashley's hand she reaches for the car keys closer ashley's fingertips barely touch them when giles' hand suddenly swoops in from o.s., brushes ashley's fingers just before grabbing the keys and swiping them back to his side! somehow ashley keeps herself from screaming as she yanks her hand back, presses herself against the fence. she puts her hand over her mouth to silence her own breathing kale's pov giles stands frozen in the shadows behind ashley. with ashley she slowly turns her head, sees giles through one of the cracks standing right there. ashley starts to slowly sliiide away... when suddenly a twig snaps under her foot! ashley freezes. she peers back through the nearest crack. ashley's pov searching for giles doesn't see him ashley presses herself even harder against the fence as we... tilt up and pan over to reveal giles peering over the fence. we can only hope it's tall enough to keep him from looking down and seeing ashley. with kale he's seeing it all. on giles he raises up, standing on his tip toes to get a better look down. shifting his head back and forth. with kale he ducks behind the shrub, contemplating his next move. he glances down, picks up a large pebble. he pops out and tosses it over into giles' yard. we hear it dropping through branches, scattering to the ground as kale ducks back behind the shrub, breathing hard. he then peers back out his pov giles lowers back down, turns and heads back toward the house. kale sighs in relief. waves ashley the "all clear." ashley heads back over to kale, breathless.}
<C>__{ashley}
<P>__{(oddly exhilarated)}
<D>__{that was intense.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{are you nuts?!}
<A>__{ashley silences kale with a finger to his lips. she then leans in, gives him a peck on the cheek and bolts away off kale, utterly stupefied }
