<L>__{interior ishmael's desoto, center valley twilight}
<A>__{ishmael driving an aged desoto through the blanketed strawberry fields of center valley.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{my father had bought the desoto fifteen years before. driving it reminded me of him. which i considered a neutral fact...}
<A>__{he turns the wheel, using a cherry wood knob, specially mounted for his convenience.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{actually, it was pleasant.}
<A>__{following the curve, fields are pure white to the horizon.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{snow made all the fields into one. the notion that one man might kill another for a small patch, made no sense.}
<A>__{up ahead, a willys station wagon has run into a ditch. a middle aged japanese man is working at a rear wheel with a shovel.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{but i knew such things occurred. having been to war and all.}
<A>__{the man is hisao imada, and we can now see his eldest daughter working with a shovel behind the car. ishmael pulls up behind them. and gets out. he crunches over to where hisao works...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{may i give you folks a lift?}
<A>__{hatsue has come around the car now, pulling her snowflaked hair from her eyes.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i didn't look at her. i thought that would be best.}
<A>__{her eyes on ishmael's profile, hatsue goes to her father's side. murmurs to him in japanese. when he answers, she turns to face ishmael...}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{my father is grateful for your kindness. but he will free his car, shortly.}
<A>__{ishmael smiles softly. this car isn't going anywhere. he goes to hatsue, reaching gently for her shovel.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{okay, i will help.}
