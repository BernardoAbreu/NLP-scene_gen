<L>__{interior long corridor day}
<A>__{sound of surf, distant, muffled. camera moves slowly towards a door. the final door no others beyond this. echoic footsteps. tight on white his haggard face moves through darkness. he looks down at his walking feet. his p.o.v. white sees water, waves breaking, through the cracks in the floorboards of the hallway.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the cracks around the closed door are illuminated, white hot, by the sun outside. on his hand as he reaches towards the handle. on his face as the door opens. a sharp line of light cuts across his features, as his eyes blink and water. the wind pulls at his messy hair. surf noise is louder now. reverse angle wider outside looking through the door, along a long wooden pier jutting out into a blue seascape. at the end of the pier stands the tiny figure of a woman with red hair. she looks out at the ocean, her back turned. angle looks back at white standing in the open doorway, squints into the sun. suddenly he looks relieved, almost happy for the first time. he steps out of frame briskly a weight gone from his shoulders. everything is clear finally, he knows exactly what to do. a voice recites names over a p.a. system.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{a tracking shot follows white, moves down the pier toward the woman. as white steps up to her, she turns and smiles.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{beautiful.}
<A>__{white nods slowly. he looks out of place in his crumpled suit. he stares out at the ocean. seagulls fly over. sun reflects off waves.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<A>__{he looks at her. smiles. then, slowly, brings his hands to her throat.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{john... white.}
