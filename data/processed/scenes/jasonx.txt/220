<A>__{as he tightens his grip around delongpre's neck. he can't fight back. rizzo is fighting to untangle her harness. we can hear delongpre choking over the radio. the three are spinning even closer and closer towards earth ii. then, rizzo reaches down. she grabs delongpre's leg and clicks a button on her sleeve. ka chsshsh!!! her air tank blows! jason is thrown off of them! but he's still tangled in rizzo's hoses. and now she has no air. jason turns...grabs the hoses and begins pulling himself toward rizzo and delongpre. he has them...when wham!}
<B>__{brodski}
<A>__{still barely alive barrels into jason, vlinging to his back. he turns, slashes with his knife and severs the hoses. jason and brodski tumble towards earth ii.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{rizzo's turning blue. she's about to pass out, when delongpre pulls a hose from his suit and hooks it into her tank.}
