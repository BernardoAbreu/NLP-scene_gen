<A>__{moxica starts scrambling up the rocks behind him, with columbus following. the climb through the dense undergrowth is so exhausting, they are now almost climbing in slow motion.}
<L>__{exterior top of cliff day}
<A>__{moxica bursts out of the undergrowth. he is at the edge of emptiness, swept by a violent offshore wind. he turns frantically, to see columbus coming up behind him. knowing he is lost, moxica regains his natural arrogance. he steps backwards towards the edge.}

<D>__{you know what they will say in spain about my death don't you?}
<A>__{he takes another step backwards, as columbus moves towards him.}
<C>__{moxica}
<D>__{you are nothing! you bastards will never inherit your titles. we are everything. we are immortal!}
<A>__{he smiles, and steps back into space.}
