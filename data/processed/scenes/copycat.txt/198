<B>__{pov. a gold colored vw bug}
<A>__{it is parked under a tree some distance across a parking lot jammed with student cars. it is partly in shadow, so she could easily have missed it. she jumps out of the car and moves fast up the steps through students, drinking, kissing, studying, arguing...}
<L>__{interior chi omega night}
<A>__{main meeting room. full of people milling about. music is playing. sees the back of a tall man on crutches talking to a coed. he has a load of books she takes from him; she is laughing. m.j. moving fast toward them, she runs into a girl, spilling the girls' drink on her blouse...}

<A>__{she jerks away, almost knocking the girl down. the girl is yelling, beginning to attract attention. as m.j. turns back to see. peter and the coed are just moving off, the coed holding his books, he hobbling on the crutches. m.j. runs through the crowd toward him, and those who notice are pissed... she is getting close when, just as he and the coed would pass from sight behind a wall, peter looks around, straight at m.j.. it isn't peter at all. m.j. looking around, moves to stairs to second floor... m.j. emerging from stairs into the corridor she runs down this corridor of rooms, pushing open any that are shut.}
<B>__{a scared couple making love confront her gun. she reholsters it and races down the hallway... over the party noise and music we hear a scream. m.j. races}
