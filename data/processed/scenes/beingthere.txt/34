<L>__{exterior front of townhouse afternoon}
<A>__{chance stops short on the front steps; the townhouse is situated in a decaying ghetto. the snow is a dirty grey, houses adjoining have their windows shattered, are smeared with grafitti. chance tries to return to the safety of the townhouse, but the door is locked. he stands on the steps for a moment, then moves to the trash laden sidewalk. he stops, ponders which way to go, finally makes up his mind and moves off to his left.}
