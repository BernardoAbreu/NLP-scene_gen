<A>__{several large military helicopters approach troop contingents from pendleton and ft. irwin. the big ch 54 dual rotor copters set down and offload marines and army infantry. others, like apache gunship combat copters and hueys, begin to follow the pursuit. they join the police and tv copters, and it looks like the ride of the valkyries.}
