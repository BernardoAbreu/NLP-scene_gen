<L>__{interior foyer day}
<A>__{gary heard the whole conversation. or at least enough of it to be deeply freaked out.}
<L>__{interior upstairs walkway night}
<A>__{margaret leans out her doorway:}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{goodnight, ratface.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{gary sits in one of the upholstered chairs, staring at his still made bed. it's impossible to know what he's thinking, but the wheels are turning.}
<L>__{exterior side patio morning}
<A>__{gary opens the newspaper to a page at random. he starts circling things with a red sharpie. macro close up. his pen circles the number nine every time it appears. as he flips the page, he spots sarah looking in through the rounded trellis, just a few feet away. she's holding her own newspaper, still in the wrapper.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{hey neighbor.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{sorry for the psychotic episode. i will blame it on hormones.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{are you alright? you look a little beautiful mind ish.}
<A>__{he almost deflects it, but decides to trust her:}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{how many times should the number nine come up? probablistically?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{probablistically?}
<C>__{gary}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{one time out of ten.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{how about every time?}
<A>__{he hands her the paper through the bars.}
<C>__{gary }
<D>__{but they only show up when you look for them. looking for them changes things.}
<A>__{trying to find an explanation...}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{some of these are prices. there's going to be a lot of nines when...}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{there is something wrong with the world.}
<A>__{sarah looks up slowly. she smiles for an uncomfortably long beat. she's stalling, thinking.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you have an eyelash on your... here...}
<A>__{she steps forward, and motions for him to lean closer to the bars. brushing off the non existent eyelash, she whispers:}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{i can get you out of here. but you have to trust me. margaret [o.s.] morning.}
<B>__{margaret}
<A>__{enters, carrying her tea. she sees gary by himself, leaning near the bars of the trellis.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{everything okay?}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{peachy.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{peachy's good. i like peaches.}
<A>__{wider, we see that sarah is flush back against the wall, out of margaret's line of sight.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{you want coffee?}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{she turns and heads back into the house. once she's out of earshot...}
<C>__{gary }
<D>__{what do i do?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you have to trust me.}
