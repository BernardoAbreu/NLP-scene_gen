<L>__{exterior castelvecchio, cafe day}
<A>__{jack sits at an empty table next to the woman. she finishes her call in english. she's well spoken. as she replaces the phone in her handbag, she knocks the newspaper off her table. jack picks it up.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{grazie.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{prego. you're welcome.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you're american.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{"amidst gathering clouds".}
<A>__{the woman speaks quickly, purposefully, barely looking at}
<B>__{jack.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you're assuming i'm english or you'd never have mentioned the weather. in fact i'm belgian but i went to boarding school in england. and am quite happy to converse on all subjects meteorological.}
<A>__{judging by her stilted choice of words this is code. a waiter comes out and flicks a cloth over the table. it's nearly midday and the sun is hot. he speaks with a tired voice:}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{buon giorno. desidera?}
<A>__{he's addressing the woman.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{una spremute di limone. per favore.}
<A>__{her italian accent is perfect.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{signore?}
<A>__{the woman looks at jack for the first time, studying him, awaiting his answer as if a great deal depended on it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{una gelata alla fragola. per favore.}
<A>__{the final fail safe. now they can introduce themselves:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{edward.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{mathilde.}
<A>__{the identification process over, there is nothing more to do but get down to business and conversation becomes suddenly awkward.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{it's hot. my car has no air conditioning. i asked for it, but...}
<A>__{she trails off.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what car did they give you?}
<A>__{her hazel eyes flick over the crowd in front of the cafe. she doesn't answer. jack clears his throat. then says quietly:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{range?}
<A>__{she takes a long time to answer. when she does, she does so over the rim of her half empty coffee cup, scanning the crowd like a cheating wife customarily anxious not to be seen by her husband.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{one fifty to one seven five meters.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{time?}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{five seconds. seven at the most.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{targets?}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{one.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fire rate?}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{rapid.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{magazine capacity?}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{large. preferably 9mm parabellum.}
<A>__{the waiter delivers the spremuta and the raspberry ice cream. the glass of lemon juice twists in mathilde's slender fingers.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{the weapon must be fairly light. and compact. possible to be broken down into its constituent parts.}
<C>__{l'americano}
<D>__{how compact?}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{as compact as possible.}
<A>__{jack clears his throat.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you want a submachine gun to fit in a lady's purse?}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{a small vanity case would be permissible.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{a small briefcase would be possible.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{x rays? camouflage: lap top, dvd player, mp3 or digital camera?}
<A>__{she's not sure if he's joking or not. neither are we.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{not necessary.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{noise?}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{silencer.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no such thing. you'll have to make do with a suppressor like everyone else. it'll dampen the decibels, dislocate the sound source and reduce muzzle flash. i can't make you silent but i can make you invisible as the finnish phrase goes, but only as long as you're prepared to lose some range.}
<A>__{jack scans the crowd. on the other side of the square he spots a young man in his mid thirties with short blonde hair and slight sunburn, hovering by a stall. average height, slim, athletic build; sunglasses, stone washed designer jeans very neatly pressed with a sharp crease.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{two o'clock.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{by the clothes stall. light blue shirt, open at the neck, expensive buff suede shoes. is he with you?}
<A>__{the young man has disappeared into the crowd.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{i didn't see him. in any case, i'm alone.}
<A>__{a pause. jack's jaw muscles grind.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{i can accept a slight loss of range.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you want a weapon with the firing capacity of a submachine gun and the range of a rifle.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{can you do it?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{give me a month. to trial. then a week for final adjustments.}
