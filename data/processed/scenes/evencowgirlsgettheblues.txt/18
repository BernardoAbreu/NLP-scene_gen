<A>__{sissy gets out of the truck and looks up at a large building.}
<L>__{interior countess's office day}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{sit down dear, do sit down.}
<A>__{sissy hankshaw takes a seat. the countess lifts a dusty decanter.}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{take a load off those lovely tootsies. yes, sit right down. would you fancy some sherry?}
<A>__{the decanter is empty, a stiff fly lies feet up on it's lip.}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{shit o goodness, i'm all out of sherry; how about some red ripple?}
<A>__{he reaches into a midget refrigerator beside his desk and pulls out some pop wine.}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{you know what red ripple is don't you? it's kool aid with a hard on. tee hee.}
<A>__{sissy manages a polite smile. she looks at a heavily finger printed glass.}
<C>__{the countess}
<P>__{(he toasts)}
<D>__{to my own special sissy. cheers! and welcome. so my letter brought ya flying, eh? where were you? salt lake city? la conner? well, i may have a little surprise for you. but first, tell me about yourself. it's been six months, hasn't it? in some circles that's half a year. how are you?}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{tired...}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{that's the very first time in the eons that i've known you that i've ever heard you complain. and now you're tired, poor darling.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{a born freak can only go uphill.}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{freak, schmeek. most of us are freaks in one way or another. try being born a male russian countess into a white middle class baptist family in mississippi and you'll see what i mean.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{i've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. it's the people who have been deformed by society i feel sorry for. i've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. maybe i should rest up for a spell, i'm not as young as i used to be.}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{shit o goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{does that mean you might have an assignment for me?}
<A>__{the countess taps his monocle with his cigarette holder. he looks on his wall, and on a poster advertising a feminine hygene product, yoni yum dew spray, stands sissy hankshaw, her thumbs neatly hidden, chopped off by the borders of the photograph.}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{you were the yoni yum girl from, let's see,}
<P>__{(peruses the ad layouts on the wall)}
<D>__{from nineteen sixty eight through nineteen seventy. you've always smelled so nice. like a little sister. the irony has just killed me. you, the dew girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need dew. i loath the stink of females! they are so sweet the way god made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. they all stink. from the queen of england to bonanza jellybean, they stink.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{bonanza jellybean?}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{what? oh yes. tee hee. jellybean.}
<A>__{the countess's jaw muscles calm down, his dentures ease into a samba...}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{she's a young thing who works on my ranch. real name is sally jones or something wooden like that. she's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. but she stinks like a slut just the same.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{your ranch?}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{oh my dear yes, i bought a little ranch out west, sort of a tribute to the women of america who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, dew spray mist and yoni yum spray powder. a tax write off, actually.}
<A>__{he looks out his window as a squirrel crosses park avenue.}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{sissy, sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. the countess has arranged a job for you. and what a job...}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{a job for me?}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{i am once more about to make advertising history. and only you, the original yoni yum dew girl, could possibly assist me.}
<A>__{the countess hands sissy an article that she reads clenched in her fist.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{the food and drug administration said wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. although the fda judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{shit o dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. the nerve of those twits. what do they know about female odor? don't interrupt. here's my concept. my ranch out west? it's a beauty ranch. oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. but it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women divorcees and widows, mainly can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. my ranch is named the rubber rose, after the rubber rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. so get this. it's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. the last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. well, these cranes stop off at my little pond siwash lake, it's called twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. i've never seen them, understand, but i hear they're magnificent. very big specimens i mean, huge mothers and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. it's just the wildest show in nature. it's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. dears, it's overwhelming. and picture the birds doing their sex dance on tv. right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual yet clean and pure enough to suit the pope. with lovely sissy hankshaw in the foreground. in a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. in a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of yoni yum. and a can of dew. off camera, a string quartet is playing debussy. a sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. are you starting to get it? doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? my very goodness gracious! grandiose, lyrical, erotic and girl scout oriented; you can't top it. i've hired a crew of experts from walt disney studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. you're my eternal favorite. princess grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; anyway, dear, i'm out of photography now and into water colors. ah how circuitous conversation is! we're back at the beginning. the exact man i've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.}
<A>__{sissy dares a sip of red ripple.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{if you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{purely personal. i believe you might enjoy one another.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{but countess...}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{now, now. don't get exasperated. i realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and i might add, you've been wise. heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. for men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: the male gets his food, bed, laundry, tv, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. but for a woman marriage is surrender.}
<A>__{the countess refills his glass. the squirrel starts across park avenue again but doesn't make it. the uniformed chauffeur gets out of a limousine and holds the crushed animal up where it can be seen by an elderly woman passenger.}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{but here you are, still a virgin you are virginal yet, aren't you?}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{why, yes, technically. jack kerouac and i came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, i think...}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{yes, well, what i'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. she can't wait too long, you know. now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. i mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.}
<C>__{sissy}
<P>__{(her brow spaghettied)}
<D>__{what makes you think this watercolorist and i would develop a romantic relationship?}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{i can't be certain that you would. but what have you got to lose?}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{well, okay. i will try it. i don't see the point in it, but i will try it. just for you. it's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in new york city. however...}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. julian is a gentleman.}
<A>__{suddenly the countess swivels in his desk chair and leans forward. lowering his wine glass, he focuses directly, intensely into sissy's blue eyes. his smile widens.}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{by the way, sissy... he's a full blooded indian.}
