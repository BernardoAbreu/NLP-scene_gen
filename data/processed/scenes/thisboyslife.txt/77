<L>__{interior kitchen next morning}
<A>__{toby is eating toast at the kitchen table. norma has made a big breakfast, and she hurriedly pours the coffee when she hears dwight and caroline's bedroom door open.}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{happy wedding breakfast!}
<A>__{caroline's eyes are red and swollen. dwight turns on a radio, sips his coffee, and chats with norma. toby gives norma's rear end an appreciative glance, then comes up behind caroline, speaking sotto voce:}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{so how's the bride?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{don't.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{the bride doesn't want to chat?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{stop it.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well, the bride is sure snotty this morning.}
<A>__{smiling, toby waits for some response to his teasing, but there is none. she turns away and sits at the table.}
