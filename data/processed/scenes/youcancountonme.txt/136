<D>__{anyway... i don't know what the church's position is on adultery and fornication these days, but i felt really hypocritical not saying anything to you about it before, so... what is the official position on that stuff these days?}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{well... it's a sin.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{good: i think it should be.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{...but we don't tend to focus on that aspect of it, right off the bat }
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{well }
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i think you should.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{well }
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{maybe it was better when you came in and they screamed at you for having sex with your married boss, and were really mean to you, and told you what a terrible thing it was. maybe it'd be better if you told me how i'm endangering my immortal soul, and if i don't quit i'm going to burn in hell. don't you ever think that?}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{um... no.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{well, it's a lot better than all this "why do you think you're in this situation" psychological bullshit you hear all the time.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{well... why do you think you're in this situation?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{with which one?}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{all of them.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i feel sorry for them.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{isn't that ridiculous?}
<A>__{ron shrugs: i.e., "not necessarily."}
