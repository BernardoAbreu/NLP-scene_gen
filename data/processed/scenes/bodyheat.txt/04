<L>__{interior stella's coffee shop first street day}
<A>__{racine and lowenstein are seated at the counter. racine drinks beer while lowenstein drinks a tall iced tea very rapidly and signals for another. this place is across the street from the courthouse police station and there are plenty of lawyers and cops around, several of whom acknowledge lowenstein and racine with pats or nods. a single unit air conditioner is blowing away above the door, but it can't compete with the blasts of hot air that come in with each new patron. all of these people, like the pedestrians outside the window, have stripped down to essentials in the infernal heat. the lawyers all carry their jackets, but even so their shirtsleeves are sweaty. the town is sizzling.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{ i think i've underestimated you, ned. i don't know why it took me so long. you've started using your incompetence as a weapon.}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{my defense was evolving. you guys got scared. costanza doesn't like me. what'd i do to him?}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{he's an unhappy man, thinks he should be circuit court by now. here he is in a state with really top notch corruption and he's stuck with the county toilets.}
<P>__{(he drinks)}
<D>__{i'm surprised you weren't in on that toilet caper. could have been that quick score you've always been searching for.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{maybe costanza was in on it. that's why he was mad.}
<A>__{stella, the owner of the coffee shop, writes and places separate checks in front of the two men.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{what's the word from the hallowed halls of justice? anything juicy?}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{maybe stella was in on it.}
<P>__{(finished his tea)}
<D>__{stella, when you gonna get a real air conditioner in here. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{you don't like it there's lots of other places.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{they don't have you. gotta go.}
<A>__{he stands fishing for change, but racine takes his check and places it with his own. lowenstein nods and moves for the door.}
<C>__{lowenstein}
<D>__{you can't buy me. no sirree, i don't come cheap.}
<A>__{just before he reaches the door he does a strange thing he takes several graceful dance steps in the astaire manner.}
<C>__{a voice}
<D>__{lowenstein, you're a fag.}
<A>__{lowenstein spins out the door, where he is blasted by the heavy air. his body droops as he disappears.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{why does he do that?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{he's pretty good, that's the weird part.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{did you hear about dr. block?}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{no. do i want to?}
<C>__{stella}
<P>__{(leans toward him, confidential)}
<D>__{agnes marshall.}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(the thought disgusts him)}
<D>__{that must have been mrs. block's idea, some kind of punishment.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{it was! how'd you know? christ, you're plugged in better than me. so you must know about mrs. block's friend in ocean grove.}
<A>__{racine winces, gets up, and puts money on the counter. he lights a cigarette.}
<D>__{converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{stella, this is beneath even you. things must be slow.}
<A>__{stella agrees with a shrug as racine heads for the door.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{it's the heat.}
