<L>__{interior lobby day}
<A>__{the next morning. as jack passes through the lobby, he hears the plaintive plinking of a piano. curious, he goes to the dining room and peers in. the tables have yet to be set for the evening and, except for frank, the room is empty.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{what's it look like i'm doing? i'm tuning a goddamn piano.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yes, really. i don't want you to be unhappy, jack. if you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.}
<A>__{jack smiles to himself and crosses the room.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how's it coming?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how long you been at it?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{half hour. once i finish this octave i'm gonna get breakfast. you see what's on the buffet?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{they stopped serving two hours ago.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{two hours ago!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{time flies, huh?}
<A>__{frank looks despairingly at the pianos.}
