<D>__{i love... i don't know. the way we are with each other, most of the time, anyway. i love how she's more capable of feeling joy than anyone i've ever known. i just like being with her, just riding bikes or going out to dinner, even if it's just a plate lunch at rainbow's. years ago we used to do a lot of paddling together.}
