<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior kalyra winery parking lot day}
<A>__{the sun hangs low as the saab pulls into the parking lot, jack at the wheel.}
<L>__{interior kalyra tasting room day}
<A>__{the pourer, a brunette in her early thirties, breaks away from a boring couple down the bar. this is stephanie.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{hey, guys. how's it going?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{excellent. my friend and i are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a syrah.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{that's what people say.}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(slurring slightly)}
<D>__{you gotta excuse him. yesterday he didn't know pinot noir from film noir.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm a quick learner.}
<A>__{stephanie laughs. she apparently likes big good natured lunks like jack.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i'm trying to teach my friend here some basics about wine over the next few days before he goes off and }
<A>__{whoomp! under the bar jack stomps on miles's foot. miles winces. stephanie slides two glasses in front of them.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that's right i'm here to learn. i never had that much interest in wine before, but this trip has been very enlightening. always like wine, of course, but i don't know. more of a beer man, really. microbreweries.}
<A>__{she thumps the cork off a bottle of chardonnay.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{well, no better way to learn than tasting.}
<A>__{she pours almost flirtatious amounts.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{now there's a girl who knows how to pour. what's your name?}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{stephanie.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{nice.}
<A>__{jack swirls the wine as though he were by now a sommelier. they look, they smell, they taste.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{so what do you think?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{quaffable but far from transcendent.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i like it. tastes great. oaky.}
<A>__{stephanie reaches for another bottle and pours. jack's eyes never leave her.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{cabernet franc.}
<P>__{(as they taste)}
<D>__{this is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. very few wineries around here do a straight cabernet franc. it's from our vineyard up in santa maria. and it was a silver medal winner at paso robles last year.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{well, i've come to never expect greatness from a cab franc, and this one's no exception. sort of a flabby, overripe }
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(ignoring him)}
<D>__{tastes good to me. you live around here, stephanie?}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{in santa ynez.}
<P>__{(low, to miles)}
<D>__{and i agree with you about cab franc.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh yeah? we're just over in buellton. windmill inn.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{oh yeah.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you know a gal named maya? works at the hitching post?}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{sure i know maya. real well.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no shit. we just had a drink with her last night. miles knows her.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{could we move on to the syrah, please?}
<A>__{as she turns to reach for the right bottle, jack winks at miles. miles shakes his head.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{this is our estate syrah...}
<A>__{she pours each of them a full half glass.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're a bad, bad girl, stephanie.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{i know. i might need to be spanked.}
<A>__{she notices the boring couple, visibly annoyed that she has been monopolized.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{as she wanders down the bar, jack turns to miles, his mouth wide open.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{a bad girl, miles. she might need to be spanked.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{do you know how often these pourers get hit on?}
<A>__{they glance down the bar at stepanie. she smiles back.}
