<LOC>__{INT.  A WOMB.  DAY.}
<ACTION>__{A fiber optic camera observes a five-month-old MALE FETUS as he gently floats, weightless, suspended in the amniotic fluid of his mother's womb.  We focus on the unborn's hand, already a tiny, exquisite work of art, moving towards his newly formed lips.  He sucks his thumb.}
<LOC>__{INT.  HOSPITAL - DELIVERY ROOM.  DAY.}
<ACTION>__{A seconds old BABY BOY - umbilical cord still attached, smeared with blood and protective skin grease - is held up by an anonymous pair of latex gloves to the camera.  Shocked by the unaccustomed light and cool of the delivery room, the newborn fights for his first, arduous breath.  Following almost immediately, a cry. From another angle we see the crying infant on a television screen, the individual lines of the screen clearly visible.}

<LOC>__{INT.  CAR - UTOPIA, QUEENS.  MORNING.}
<ACTION>__{The face of the baby thirty-four years later, still crying. TRUMAN BURBANK, thinning hair, a body going soft around the edges, appearing older than his thirty-four years sits at the wheel of his eight-year-old Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.  He cries without shame, making no attempt to wipe away the tears. Pausing at an intersection in a quiet, working-class suburban street, a spherical glass object suddenly falls from the sky and lands with a deafening crash on the roadway, several yards in front of his idling car. Truman exits the Oldsmobile to investigate.  Amidst a sea of shattered glass are the remains of a light mechanism. He looks around him but the street is deserted.  He checks that all the surrounding streetlights are accounted for, even though the fallen fixture is far larger.  He looks up into the sky but there is no plane in sight.  With some effort, Truman picks up what's left of the crumpled light, loads it into the trunk of his car and drives away.}

<LOC>__{EXT.  LONG, WIDE BEACH.  DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.}
<ACTION>__{Unlike a conventional flashback, the scene in his memory appears to be playing on a television screen. A sandy-haired, SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, runs towards a bluff on the beach. The boy's father, KIRK, late-thirties, beer bottle in hand, flirts with two TEENAGE GIRLS at the shoreline.  Suddenly, the father remembers his son.  He looks anxiously around.  The sight of the boy at the far end of the beach causes him to drop his bottle in the sand and run to him. The boy is near the top of the cliff before his agitated father comes within earshot.}

<LOC>__{EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN, FINANCIAL DISTRICT.  MORNING.}
<ACTION>__{TRUMAN emerges from a subway exit in Lower Manhattan and walks briskly down the bustling street.  A snarl of taxis, buses and COMMUTER traffic.  A STREET VENDOR thrusts a pretzel under Truman's nose, a CAREER WOMAN catches his eye. Truman stops at a newspaper stand and plucks an issue of Cosmopolitan from the rack, quickly flicking through the glossy pages.  Glancing in the direction of the NEWSPAPER VENDOR and finding him busy with another customer, Truman deftly tears a portion of the open page and pockets the cutting. He guiltily replaces the magazine, startled to find the Newspaper Vendor standing close behind him.}

<ACTION>__{As Truman hurries away, the Vendor picks up the copy of Cosmo and instantly turns to the torn page.  It is a Lancome advertisement with ISABELLA ROSSELLINI's nose missing. Truman is still in view but the Vendor makes no effort to confront him, almost as if he were expecting it. Passing one of the tall, black mirrored buildings that grow out of the pavement, Truman glimpses himself in the reflective glass.  He doesn't like what he sees and attempts to suck in his gut, but quickly concedes defeat.  The image triggers another childhood memory.}
<LOC>__{INT.  SCHOOLROOM.  DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.}
<ACTION>__{Once again, the flashback appears to be playing on a television screen. The sandy-haired SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits in the middle row of a Catholic Elementary School classroom surrounded by thirty-or- so other well-scrubbed, uniformed YOUNGSTERS.

<ACTION>__{An abandoned freeway project in Queens.  The four hundred yard stretch of deserted freeway is paved but unmarked.  At one end is an off-ramp that abruptly ends in inid-air, reinforcing steel protuding from the concrete. TRUMAN stands at the end of the off-ramp with MARLON, thirty- two, the kind of physique some descibe as fat, others big. Marlon drinks beer from a can while Truman addresses a teed-up golf ball with a number three wood. Truman winds up and swings, making a healthy contact with the ball.  The ball arches away into the night sky, lit by the adjacent operating roadway.  From a new angle we see the ball take a huge hop on the outside lane of the abandoned freeway and continue down the asphalt.

The curved bank of monitors, suspended by cables from the ceiling, gives the appearance of a giant patch-work mobile. Investigating the screens we discover surveillance pictures from all over New York City, covering every facet of Truman's life. Camera angles from the interior of Truman's house, his backyard, car, subway station, office, the deli he frequents, the seashore to which he is drawn, the park he visits with Veronica, the abandoned freeway where he golfs with Marlon, many of the locations strangely devoid of people. Beneath the video wall is a state-of-the-art mixing desk, its illuminated buttons glowing brightly in the gloom.  Facing the desk, several OPERATORS in high-backed, high-tech swivel chairs, wearing the slimmest of headsets.  SIMEON, a meticulous young man with a penetrating gaze, sits directly in front of the largest of the monitors, co-ordinating camera angles.

His will, draining away. As he is about to be overcome by the next wave, he thrusts his arm into the handles of the spinning wheel.  He cries out in pain at the blow to his forearm but succeeds in halting the wheel.  He braces for one last wave. But the wave does not come.  A strange phenomenon is occurring in the ocean.  A distinct division has appeared in the ocean swell.  Between the large rolling waves lies a corridor of calmer water, several hundred yards wide, a curious escape lane. The wind and the rain are also subsiding, the darkness lifting. Truman steers his vessel down this "sea-lane". After some time, several large, dark shapes emerge on the horizon.  Land?  Islands?  As Truman steers towards the nearest shape, he discovers what is behind the peculiar wave formations. It is certainly not the moon. The dark shape is a huge iron roller, only half of which is exposed above the surface of the sea.  The ocean swell is being caused by the roller slowly turning, mechanically-driven on either end by massive steel arms pumping from the sea bed. In fact there are rollers spaced four hundred yards apart in both directions along the horizon as far as the eye can see, the calm sea-lanes formed by the gaps between the rollers. Truman's boat is dwarfed by the gigantic machines.  The exposed half of each roller, the height of a ten story building, its length equivalent to several football fields.  The massive arms perpetually churn. Truman's face is thrown into shadow as the boat slips quietly past the giant rotating drum.  The water beyond the rollers is dead calm.  Truman stares ahead desperately trying to focus his eyes. But if the sight of the wave machines was difficult to comprehend, it pales in comparison with the next sight that greets him.  His boat is drifting inexorably, on a slow collision course with the sky.  That infinitely receding horizon line recedes no more. The sea really does meet the sky.  The join is only too apparent.  Looming above him out of the sea is a cyclorama of colossal dimensions.  The sky is nothing but a painted backdrop. Truman looks upward, straining his eyes to see the top of the sky, but it curves away at a steep angle beyond his sight. The bow of the boat comes to rest against the sky, bumping gently into its latex surface.  Truman unties his bindings and stumbles across the deck to the side rail.  Clinging to the rail with one hand, he tentatively reaches out towards the painted cyclorama.  He touches the sky. He feels the surface, puts both terrified hands against it. Hie eyes well up with tears.  He presses his distraught face into it.  He screams at the top of his voice.  No words.  A primal scream.  A pained, animal howl.}

Unsecured, the Santa Maria is beginning to drift away. The sea he has feared since childhood, is nothing but an enormous tank.  The sky, a massive cyclorama.  New York City, an elaborate set.  And it is all housed within an impossibly large soundstage. Truman makes no effort to save the boat.  He shuts the door to his world.  A sign on the back of the door reads, "CLOSED SET. No Unauthorized Access."  Gradually he becomes aware of another strange phenomenon taking place in the soundstage.  All around him, thousands of light fixtures mounted in the cyclorama to masquerade as stars, are slowly illuminating - switched on by an automatic timer.

<ACTION>__{From Truman's POV we watch CHLOE approach CHRISTOF.  She has a pure white envelope in her hands.  As Christof looks up to acknowledge her, he almost makes eye contact with Truman on the tram.}
<LOC>__{INT.  STUDIO LOT.  DUSK.}
<ACTION>__{Still inside the studio complex, the tram enters the courtyard of an indoor shopping mall.  Truman gift shops. TRUMAN is momentarily frozen by the sight of window displays full of books and board games carrying his likeness with titles such as, "TrumanTrivia".  Video cassettes offering "Truman Highlights".  His face emblazoned on T-shirts, caps, coffee mugs and posters.  Even Truman Dolls and a model of his decaying Oldsmobile are offered for sale. The tram slows to a stop behind other trams at the tour's end. STUDIO POLICE are checking the disembarking PASSENGERS.  Truman, using the TOUR GUIDE as a shield, also exits the tram.}

<ACTION>__{Truman contemptuously backhands the Guide across the face and makes a run for it.  The guards give chase.  Truman runs into a lookalike mannequin, dressed in a brown suit identical to his own, promoting "TrumanWear".  He pulls his "double" to the ground to block the guards' path. Sprinting along a featureless corridor, he reaches a dead end.}

<ACTION>__{Truman enters a doorway marked "NO ENTRY" to find a stairway leading upwards.  He takes the stairs three at a time. The footsteps and shouts of the guards not far behind.  Flight after flight of stairs.  At one point, he loses his grip on the stair's railing and his gun falls from his hand, clattering for an eternity down the stairwell. He finally emerges on a landing.  Lungs bursting.  One more door.  He tries the handle.  It opens.}
<LOC>__{EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE.  DUSK.}
<ACTION>__{TRUMAN finds himself on the roof of the soundstage.  Outside. Really outside for the first time in his life. He looks frantically around him.  Nowhere to hide.  The soundstage stretches for miles in both directions as far as the eye can see, an interminable expanse of roof. Facing him, a colossal Burbank.  Several other soundstages almost as gigantic as his own.  The palm trees lining the streets, dwarfed by the mammoth barns. The Hollywood Freeway in the distance, carrying its ribbons of traffic, twenty lanes wide.  Gargantuan office buildings eclipse any skyscraper Truman has ever known. Directly below him, a dizzying drop to the studio lot and its arched entranceway. Above him, a large yellow moon in the twilight sky.  The real moon, not the planetarium projection he has been contemplating for the last thirty-four years. Truman wheels around, suddenly realizing he is not alone.  A GROUP has emerged on the rooftop, standing still and silent in a semi-circle, cutting off any escape. Along with the STUDIO GUARDS, keeping their distance in the background, are CHLOE, SIMEON, and the two studio executives, MOSES and ROMAN.  In front of them, the co-stars in his life - MARLON, MERYL, sister RAQUEL, mother AUDREY and supposedly dead father KIRK.  No one moves or speaks as Truman scans the familiar faces.  Marlon, in particular, cannot look him in the eye. Truman's gaze finally falls on the white-haired old man standing at the head of the group.  CHRISTOF.  He approaches Truman alone, carrying a white envelope, calling his name the way a father calls to a son.}

<ACTION>__{Truman seems to sense the significance Christof has had in his life, drawn to and repelled by him at the same time.  As they stand together looking into each other's eyes for the first time, they seem to be the only two figures on the roof.  For a moment Truman averts his gaze to the night sky.}

With a strength he never knew he possessed, Truman forces Christof to the edge of the soundstage roof, threatening to throw them both off his counterfeit world. Christof clings desperately to Truman to save himself.  The studio guards dare not move.}

<ACTION>__{It takes all of Truman's will not to hurl the old man into the abyss.  Christof, petrified, looks to the pristine, white envelope that lies half over the edge of the roof, glinting in the moonlight. Truman follows Christof's gaze.  Contemptuously tossing Christof aside, he retrieves the envelope.  Christof crawls to safety, thankful to still be alive, suddenly appearing very small and insignificant. But Christof and the other figures on the rooftop no longer exist in Truman's mind.  Truman gazes at his name for a long moment, handwritten on the envelope in blue ink, then carefully breaks the seal.  Truman allows the sole item in the envelope to be slowly revealed.  A photograph.  A close up of SYLVIA's face including her eyes, mouth and that perfect, ever-elusive nose. A serenity comes over Truman.  He lifts up his eyes to the mountains on the far horizon.  As he stands on the very edge of the soundstage roof without fear, clutching the photograph, we commence a long, slow pull-back. Truman is unaware that directly beneath his feet on the wall of the enormous soundstage is a billboard acrrying a gigantic picture of his face and proclaiming, "TRUMAN - Total Record of a Human Life.  34TH GREAT YEAR!" We continue to pull back until Truman is nothing but a speck on top of the soundstage so large it never completely clears frame.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{A MONTAGE OF VARIOUS LOCATIONS}
<ACTION>__{The two OLD WOMEN in the living room, the NIGHTWATCHMEN, the two YOUNG MEN with the Watchman TV, the PATRONS in the bar, PASSERS-BY outside an electronics store are all captivated by their television sets. We focus on the screen of a television.  A small FEMALE BABY sucks a toy on a blanket in the backyard of Truman's old suburban home in Queens, the lawn he mowed for ten years of his life.  The infant's doting parents, MARLON and the new actress VIVIEN, enter frame and begin to fuss over the child.  A border around the action on the screen announces, "ZOE - Total Record Of a Human Life". Suddenly we see a child's hand on top of the television screen. A BABY stands unsteadily, supporting herself against the television set in Sylvia's house. TRUMAN bends down and picks up his baby, tossing her into the air, much to the child's delight.  Truman dwells for a moment on the mirror-image scene on the television before very deliberately shutting it off. SYLVIA joins Truman and their daughter.  Together, they exit the beach house.  We follow them as they make their way onto the deserted sand and down towards the sea.}
