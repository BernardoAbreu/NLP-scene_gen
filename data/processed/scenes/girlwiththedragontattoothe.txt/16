<L>__{interior blomkvist's apartment stockholm evening}
<A>__{it's doubtful there's a stranger christmas gathering going on anywhere in the world. standing around with eggnog are: blomkvist; his teenage daughter pernilla; his sister annika and her italian husband; erika and her weirdly understanding artist husband greger, whose arm is around her waist; a few other friends (and perhaps lovers).}
<C>__{greger}
<D>__{you needed a better attorney. you needed your sister.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{she offered.}
<C>__{annika}
<D>__{he declined.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{as she hoped.}
<C>__{annika}
<D>__{never a good idea mixing family and business.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{and i still would have lost.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{did you have ... anything on him.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i had a lot. it just wasn't any good.}
<C>__{erika}
<D>__{it wasn't even about mikael. it was wennerstrom sending a message to the press as a whole and the fsa: don't ask questions.}
<A>__{blomkvist's daughter seems concerned for him.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i'm fine, nilla. you don't have to worry about me.}
<C>__{pernilla}
<D>__{mom's worried.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
