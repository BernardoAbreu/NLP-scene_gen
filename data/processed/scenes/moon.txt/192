<A>__{where all the trouble really started. matthew, the stalled harvester, with the crashed rover still trapped beneath it. the crash site is beginning to resemble some old underwater shipwreck. the rover enters the frame, beginning to slow down as it approaches the crash site. sam 2 rolls the rover to a standstill about ten feet from the front of the harvester. i e. rover moon surface moments later sam 2 keeps the engine running as sam 1 takes a handful of tranquilizers one by one, washing down each pill with a swig from a bottle of water. afterwards: a long pause. the two sams sitting side by side, staring across the bleak landscape. neither of them wants to say good bye particularly.}

<D>__{tess came in for the interview, remember?}
<A>__{sam 2 is nodding away. of course he remembers.}
<C>__{sam 1 }
<D>__{she was so beautiful. even if she wasn't the best candidate, i just knew i had to give her the job. i thought she was so sweet.}

<D>__{and then it was the end of the summer.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{she was going back to san francisco.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{you knew you had to take a chance. so you called her. you were terrified and wrote that whole speech for her answer machine }
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{but i didn't need it because tess answered the phone. and i could tell in her voice as we talked, she was thinking... "why has sam called me?" "the internship's over, why's he called me at home?" and then i asked her if she was going to adrian fiddle's barbecue and...}
<A>__{sam 1 has dropped off to sleep. the back and forth exchange is now essentially sam 2's monologue.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{that's when i knew she liked me. because she didn't want to talk to anyone else! she'd get up, get some potato salad, go to the bathroom, but she'd always come back. and then we kissed. on the steps in front of her apartment building.}
<A>__{sam 2 finally turns and looks at sam 1. sam 1's head cocked to one side, eyes closed. sam 2 lifts the helmet off sam 1's lap carefully lowers the helmet onto sam 1's head. i e. rover moon surface sam 2 lopes towards the crashed rover holding sam 1 in both arms like a bride. he places sam 1 on the ground and prizes open the rover door he slowly slides sam 1 inside. inside the rover sam 1 lies with his head jammed awkwardly against the passenger side door. at once he looks peaceful and wretchedly uncomfortable. sam 2 can barely bring himself to look at sam 1. with both hands he forces the door closed, pivots around and slowly bobs back to his rover. i e. rover moon surface moments later sam 2 driving back to base. he has removed his helmet and is brushing tears from his eyes with his glove.}
