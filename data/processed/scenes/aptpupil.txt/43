<A>__{dussander wakes up. a clanking sound echoes from the street. dussander looks like he could have been having a wonderful sex dream, but he turns his head toward the direction of the street. he clicks on the light. dressed in the ss uniform, he gets up and moves toward the window. through the window, bathed in the glow of a street lamp, a derelict, who we will come to know as archie, rummages through dussander's trashcans. under his arm are a few of the empty bourbon bottles.}
