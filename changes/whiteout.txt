<ACTION>__{Antarctica. Six million square miles of ice.    The coldest place on earth. Forty-six countries have competing claims and maintain outposts. The Antarctic Treaty holds these claims in check. There is no regular law enforcement. A single U.S. Marshal is assigned to the territory.}

<ACTION>__{Snow-covered hills thrust up out of a barren, white wasteland. No buildings, no animals... nothing. CLOSER: The hills are more defined. Rows of jagged peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses. A fine `mist' of wind-blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting ice. STILL CLOSER: We track down through valleys, skirt crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat stretch of ice. HOLD on this scene of timeless, savage beauty, then... THUD!!! A FACE, hooded and goggled in ECW (extreme cold weather gear) drops into frame, smashing down on the icy surface with such brutal impact, the shattered goggle shield pops out -- -- EYES STARE BLANKLY into camera -- locked in death. It's a man. Camera slowly starts to PULL BACK to see his limbs have snapped at unnatural angles, the head grotesquely twisted -- bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and spreads out down tiny cracks in the ice until, with startling speed, it turns dark and freezes. We PULL BACK further and look down on the body, a bizarre shape in a spider's web of frozen blood. And SLOWLY WE PULL BACK... further and further...until all is dazzling white. TITLE: WHITEOUT}

Widen slightly -- a pair of feminine hands, donning an ANTIQUE SILVER ring on the left middle finger, are slowly applying coconut tanning lotion onto firm, athletic calves. Deep. Soothing. Then -- O.C. KNOCK KNOCK on a door. The hands stop. Another KNOCK KNOCK. The lapping surf and seagull sounds come to an abrupt halt.}

<ACTION>__{Widen to meet CARRIE STETKO, late 20's. Cargo pants -- rolled up, and an exercise top. She's kicking back, but she's not at the beach. In fact, she's in an office, sitting on a chair. A NEWLY OPEN BAG OF KITTY LITTER sits next to a plastic tub she's got her feet in. Two FLOOR LAMPS stand like sentinels above her, blasting her with warm wattage. A fake palm tree casts the shadow across her body. She's pulled the earplugs out of her iPod -- back to the real world. The door opens. Leaning into the room is JAMIE CLARK (20's), African-American. She's dressed in a flannel shirt, jeans. Carrie doesn't look entirely happy at the intrusion.}

<ACTION>__{Jamie leaves. As Carrie gets to her feet, camera moves away from her, panning around the small office. Half-packed up boxes lay strewn about the floor. A CALENDER hangs crookedly before a desk. Each day has been marked off with a large X. THREE DAYS REMAIN unmarked. Last space reads: WINTER-OVER, and in the space next to it, there's a cut out picture of a tropical beach. A dart board is next to it with A PHOTOGRAPH pulverized with dart holes over the Bullseye. It's of a candy- striped pole topped with a silver ball, surrounded by international flags - the South Pole. Carrie is standing next to the pole, smiling at the camera, arm-in-arm with SAM MURPHY (30's). Looks like he's handsome, but his face is a little more obliterated than the rest of him.}

She steps around the moving boxes to her desk, which is bare except for a thick BINDER labelled,`DAILY REPORTS'. She takes a seat, opens a binder and flips past dozens of empty pages reading "INCIDENT: None. ACTION TAKEN: None." On today's page she fills in the blanks with "Theft of botany sample." And "None." A pencil falls down onto the desk before her. Bounces. Then rolls off. She doesn't even flinch, or look up. Just stares unhappily at the binder. Camera tilts up -- several pencils are stuck into the cardboard tiles. She closes the binder and puts it on the shelf beside a row of framed photos: Carrie in a Marshal's uniform graduation day; crisp, clean uniform. She and two other girlfriends, all smiles, at a bar -- she's got a birthday cake in front of her. Carrie on a beach somewhere, sitting in a chair, feet in the sand -- shaded by a palm.

<DIAL>__{Doc -- stop.}

<CHAR>__{DOC} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll cut you in, Carrie. There's at least 5 million in diamonds in there. That can buy both of us a nice life back in the world. How many times have we both talked about having a fresh start. Well, this is it. Those beakers finding that plane was a sign. A sign telling me it was time to go back.

<ACTION>__{Using both hands on the latch, he pulls. THE DOOR BLASTS OPEN, filling the space between Carrie and Doc with violent winds and blowing snow. Doc's throws one last look to Carrie, then takes two steps out the door. Disappears into the blanket of white. Wind and cold storm into the room against Carrie, who remains standing still like a statue. Emotionally drained. Numb. Freezing to death -- tears frozen to her cheeks. A shadow passes by her -- it's Pryce. He's hunkered over in pain, but forcing himself against the driving force of the wind into the Ready Room. Latches onto the door. It takes everything he's got, but he manages to get it closed. Instant silence. Cold to the bone, he grabs a jacket off the racket. Approaches Carrie, who remains staring at the closed door. The effects of the chill and Doc's decision apparent. Pryce wraps the coat around her shoulders.   Gently leads her away.}

A cut out piece of paper in the shape of a palm leaf is taped to one of the lamps -- throwing the shadow. Pryce has a small bandage over his shoulder. Carrie lies back, rests, eyes closed.}
