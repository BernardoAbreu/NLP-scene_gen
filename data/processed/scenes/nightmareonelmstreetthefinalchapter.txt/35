<L>__{interior foster home tv room the next day}
<A>__{we start on wesley's body. eyes closed, head normal and everything from the neck down charred mass of burnt torso, shriveled limbs, all wrapped in the scorched blanket. zip. a body bag hides this ghastly image from us as we pull back. a fire marshall and a cop are talking at the doorway in the background. the coroner is here, a world weary seen it all older guy, with his nervous assistant who's never seen anything like this. they whisper their conversation as they lift the body bag onto a stretcher.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{i don't get it. the couch is barely scorched. and how can he burn from just the neck down?}
<C>__{coroner}
<D>__{it happens.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{it happens? that's your explanation?}
<C>__{coroner}
<D>__{i've seen worse.}
<A>__{we follow them as they push the stretcher towards the doorway.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{what? what worse?}
<C>__{coroner}
<D>__{never mind.}
<A>__{our shot stops at the doorway with the fire marshall and cop while the wigged out assistant's voice trails off outside.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{no. i wanna know. really. what could be worse than...}
<C>__{fire marshall}
<D>__{you know what the gossip rags are going to say? spontaneous human combustion.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{fire marshall}
<D>__{that's where bodies are supposed to go up in smoke for no reason. it's all psychic bullshit. what really happened is called the candle effect. a tiny fire gets started, usually from a cigarette. it slowly smolders through the blanket and clothes until the skin starts to actually bake. the body fat begins to melt and liquefy, fueling the fire like a slow burning candle. it takes hours, but it's real.}
<A>__{the cop makes some notes. behind them we see scott, karen and gina. the girls have been crying, and even tough guy scott looks pretty screwed up by all this. the cop nods.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{he fell asleep while smoking. what a waste.}
<A>__{the kids shoot unbelieving looks at each other as the two men walk off.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{that's impossible.}
<A>__{scott and karen head for the front door.}
