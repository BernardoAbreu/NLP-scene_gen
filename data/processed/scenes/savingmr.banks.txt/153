<A>__{and then an image from the film: george banks walks away from us down the misty tree lined london street, on his way to be fired from the bank. walt disney watches with quiet satisfaction. pamela however has tears coursing down her face. her shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud but people are noticing, looking at her. disney leans forward, placing a hand on her shoulder. she reaches up and grips it tightly, unable to speak.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{it's all right, mrs travers. it's alright. mr banks is going to be all right. i promise.}
<A>__{pamela nods in gratitude, but cannot contain her sobs. it's all pouring from her now, in one immense catharsis.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{no, no. it's just that i can't, i can't abide cartoons!}
<A>__{we stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the film: let's go fly a kite. the audience around her are smiling, laughing, singing along. pamela, the tears, silent now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to mouth along with the lyrics. and in her head one final image appears. travers gaze falls upon ginty, outside his bedroom window, sweeping. their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken understanding of what is to come, before his close with tiredness.}
<C>__{travers }
<D>__{never. i promise. i will never lose you.}
