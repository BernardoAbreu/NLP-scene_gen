<L>__{interior co op night}
<A>__{paula is sitting at the dining table with a plate piled with roast chicken, potatoes, and broccoli in front of her. she has a worried look etched on her face. marian is in the kitchen in the background, feeling light and happy, a singsong quality to her voice. she brings a plate of food for herself to the table.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{and they were so friendly those young men. though i do think they should shave their beards and ... and get some nicer clothes.}
<A>__{marian sits down at the table and takes a sip of her wine, picks up her utensils and gets ready to dig in. she turns to paula who isn't touching her food, her head in her hands. marian, seemingly oblivious of her daughter's feelings, prattles on.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{what do you say ... we take a subway uptown and see a play tonight?}
<A>__{marian finally notices that paula isn't listening.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{paula}
<D>__{mom ... i mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?}
<C>__{marian}
<P>__{(stung, taken aback)}
<D>__{oh, that has nothing to do with it.}
<C>__{paula}
<D>__{no, no, it's my fault. i've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.}
<A>__{marian retreats into herself, sips her wine as if she, herself, now wonders if she's lost her mind and her buoyant mood deflates almost at once.}
<C>__{paula}
<D>__{the, um, other night, i got up to get a glass of water and you were standing by the window talking to daddy. i called out to you, but you didn't answer. you remember?}
<A>__{marian doesn't remember, and her daughter's words pierce her. she's afraid to object.}
<C>__{paula}
<D>__{new york is a ... it's a strange place in the summertime. the noise, the warm air, it's ... easy to imagine things.}
<A>__{paula lays a reassuring hand on marian's arm, talks to her condescendingly, as if she were a child.}
<C>__{paula}
<D>__{now, you know you didn't go into the clubhouse, did you?}
<A>__{marian doesn't bother to argue, fearing anything she might say would compromise her.}
<C>__{paula }
<D>__{it's okay. dad's dying put a lot of stress on you. but you're going to be all right. we're all going to be all right. where did you get this vivid imagination, huh?}
<A>__{paula grips marian's arm a little tighter and shakes it gently as if snapping her back to reality. marian returns her a tight lipped smile.}
