<L>__{9 full shot underground plotting room}
<A>__{a door swings wide willard steps through and comes to attention, blocking the view of the room. a strange reddish light pervades. the room is covered with plastic maps and filled with smoke. the whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself and there is a sense of the cut back jungle growth slowly reclaiming it.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{captain b.l. willard, g 4 headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.}
<C>__{colonel }
<D>__{okay, willard, sit down.}
<A>__{willard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a bare concrete floor. across from him, around steel desks and tables sit several men. the nearest one, a colonel puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe behind him sits a major and a seedy looking civilian.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{have you ever seen this officer before, captain willard ?}
<A>__{he points to the major.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{this gentleman or myself ?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{i believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in kontum, is that right ?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{i am not presently disposed to discuss that, sir.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{very good.}
<A>__{he turns to the colonel and nods his approval. the colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{you know much about about special forces; green berets, captain ?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{i've worked with them on occasions and i saw the movie , sir.}
<A>__{the officer smiles at this.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{then you can appreciate command's concern over their shall we say 'erratic' methods of operation.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i have never favored elite units, captain, including your paratroopers or whatever. just because a man jumps out of an airplane or wears a silly hat doesn't give him any priviliges in my book not in this man's army.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{we didn't need 'em in korea no sir, give me an ohio farm boy and an m 1 garand, none of this fancy crap no sir.}
<C>__{civilian}
<P>__{(stopping him)}
<D>__{major.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{we have special forces a detachments all along the cambodian border. two here and another one here twelve or fourteen americans pretty much on their own; they train and motivate montagnard natives; pick their own operations. if they need something, they call for it, and get it within reason. what we're concerned with is here.}
