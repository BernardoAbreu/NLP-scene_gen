<A>__{a room filled with exotic looking devices, sensors and computers which handle the enormous task of tracking the ship's position in space. the monitors around the room display various diagrams of the energy ribbon (as seen in the beginning of the film). data is sitting at a computer console which has a great deal of complex information on the screen. picard is standing next to him. throughout the following, data seems distracted and preoccupied.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{according to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every thirty nine point one years}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{when is it expected back?}
<A>__{data doesn't answer right away.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{data?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{sorry, captain. the ribbon has already entered the galaxy. it will pass through this sector in approximately thirty one hours.}
<A>__{picard moves about the room... he's frustrated... tired... but determined to find out what's going on.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{guinan said soran was trying to get back to the ribbon... if that's true, then there must be some connection with the amargosa star.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{the star's destruction has had numerous astro physical effects within this sector. however, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{give me a list of those effects. i want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed... no matter how insignificant...}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{it will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.}
<A>__{data works the computer and then the computer begins to work. data sighs his expression becomes downcast and gloomy. he sits down and puts his head in his hands. picard finally has to say something.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{data, are you all right?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{no, sir. i am finding it difficult to concentrate... i believe i am overwhelmed with feelings of... remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i wanted to save geordi... i tried. but i experienced something i did not expect.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i believe it was fear.}
<A>__{picard regards him sympathetically.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. it's something we all have to learn to deal with.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{but i did not deal with it, sir. i let it prevent me from helping my friend.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{does that make me a coward?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{no. and what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which i believe you're beginning to experience... guilt.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(considers)}
<D>__{guilt. it is a most unpleasant feeling.}
<A>__{angle (vfx p) the computer finishes its calculations and the console beeps. data works the console. information appears on screen.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{according to our current information, the destruction of the amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by five percent... the starship bozeman was forced to make a course correction... a research project on gorik four was halted due to increased neutrino particles... ambient magnetic fields have decreased by }
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{wait. the bozeman... why did it change course?}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{the destruction of the amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.}
<A>__{picard is starting to get an idea... he's onto something here. he moves to a large table in the center of the room.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(musing)}
<D>__{a minor course correction...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{where is the ribbon now?}
<A>__{angle (vfx p) data moves to the table to work. after a few beats, an elaborate map of the galaxy springs up on the ceiling of the room. a blinking dot shows the position of the ribbon.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{this is its current position.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{can you project its course?}
<A>__{data hesitates... still obsessed with his own emotional turmoil. picard finally has to lay down the law.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(firm)}
<D>__{data. i have nothing but sympathy for what you're going through. but right now, i need your full attention on the task at hand. if you can't provide it... then i will have to relieve you of duty until doctor crusher can remove this. emotion chip of yours. i'm sorry, but you leave me no other choice.}
<A>__{this snaps data back... he considers this for a long moment, then looks determined.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i do not wish to remove the chip, sir. although these emotions are proving difficult to deal with... i cannot imagine going back to a life without them. i have taken an important step toward becoming truly human. if i were to turn back now...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i would like to continue in my duties, sir.}
<A>__{picard smiles at him.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{courage is an emotion too, data.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now... can you project the course of the ribbon?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i believe so.}
<A>__{angle (vfx p) data works the console. a red line moves to form an arc through the star field. picard examines the display for a moment and nods... he's excited, on to something...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{enhance grid a nine.}
<A>__{data works and the display now zooms into a single sector. the red line cuts through the sector.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{where was the amargosa star?}
<A>__{data works. a star is highlighted near the red line.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{now... you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered... could that also affect the course of the ribbon?}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{i believe so.}
<A>__{angle (vfx p) data works and holographic display changes again. the red line representing the course of the ribbon now shifts to the right away from the amargosa star's position. picard is beginning to realize what's going on.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{that's what soran's doing... he's changing its course.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but why? why try to alter its path... why not simply fly into it with a ship?}
<A>__{data thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{our records show that every ship which has approached the ribbon has either been destroyed or severely damaged.}
<A>__{picard thinks about this... then has a flash of insight.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{he can't go to the ribbon... so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{data, is it going to pass near any m class planets?}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(works)}
<D>__{yes, sir. there are two in the veridian system.}
<A>__{angle (vfx p) the display zooms in on a star very close to the ribbon's path. we now see a solar system with a single star and four planets. the red line moves directly through the system it passes very close to the third planet. picard eyes that planet and points to it.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{it's very close to veridian three... but not close enough...}
<A>__{picard's mind is going a mile a minute. he suddenly has a horrible realization.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{data, what would happen to the ribbon's path if he destroyed the veridian star itself?}
<A>__{angle (vfx p) data works. on the display, the veridian star suddenly darkens and goes out. the red line shifts slightly until it makes an exact intersection with the third planet. they both react to this sight. they're both aware of just how serious this is.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{that's where he's going.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{it should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at amargosa.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(grim)}
<D>__{and destroy every planet in the system.}
<A>__{picard eyes the graphic with a sense of dread.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{are any of them inhabited?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{veridian three is uninhabited. but veridian four supports a pre industrial humanoid society.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{population?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{approximately two hundred thirty million.}
<A>__{a grim beat.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(to com)}
<D>__{picard to bridge.}
<C>__{worf's com voice}
<D>__{worf here, sir.}
<A>__{picard heads for the exit, a sense of urgency and determination in his every move.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{red alert, mister worf. set a course for the veridian system, maximum warp.}
<A>__{picard and data exit stellar cartography.}
