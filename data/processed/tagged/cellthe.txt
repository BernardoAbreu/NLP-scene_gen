<A>__{the pattern of the electronics grows into something more organic, textured, concrete. evolving into a world. black and shadow filled, it resembles a labyrinthine complex of vertical walls with cubicle like rooms carved deep into its core. our journey into this bleak, grim place continues and we occasionally glimpse brief images of a boy's baptism.}
<L>__{intercut :}
<A>__{with this journey are sections of cloudy blackness and fragmented visions of catherine connected to the apparatus, face masked, descending into this world. there is an abrupt shift from still images to regular motion and we find ourselves gliding over a tidepool filled with tiny fish and tadpoles. at water's edge, lying on rough, pebble strewn ground, is a hand. catherine's hand. we sense movement, but she remains still. from the darkness comes a dog. black in color and featureless, it sniffs catherine, dismisses her, and meanders into a cubicle opposite her, disappearing from view. after a moment of odd quiet, a drop of blood hits the mask and we follow catherine's hand as it moves to the cloth and removes it from her own face. in macroscopic super slow motions, another blood droplet sails 64 into the air and comes crashing down, hitting a red ant, catapulting it onto what looks like a tree, but is just a twig. as the insect scurries away, more drops pound the earth, splatter against "twig trees," and explode into pools of stagnant water... as we begin to realize that this miniature landscape is the world into which catherine descended. she sits up, shivering, and breathes deeply, acclimating to her surroundings. the "floor" is covered with filth, ash, pebbles, and insects. water is present in many forms, puddles, moisture, dripping ceilings. eyes focusing, queasy, not fully "awake," catherine notices the crimson stain on the cloth mask and the blood droplets showering the air. she turns and finds the source. the black dog stands in the opposite room next to a tub full of blood, shaking himself dry after his "bath." satisfied, the animal stops and trots away. still adjusting to this nightmarish realm, catherine at first doesn't hear it, but then realizes that somewhere, a child is crying. she looks around, then through a crack in the "floor," briefly catches sight of a boy beneath her, on a level lower than hers. as he disappears into corridor ending in "nothing," we pull back to show a massive landscape of blocks, cubicles, crawlspace, walls, stairs, and ladders. leading everywhere and nowhere. catherine spots the boy as he crawls into a specific "room." shortly after, a light comes on within the cubicle and she moves to it. we feel as though we're looking at a series of interlocked tenement rooms, some walls of which have been torn away to expose rooms within, rooms with no windows or doors. following a path of fragile steps, catherine makes her way to the lighted room and enters.}

<A>__{the frightened child retreats into a corner of the claustrophobic room, but the horse does not startle. surprisingly to the boy the horse takes an affectionate step toward catherine, inviting her to take over. catherine allows the mare to smell her, then vigorously scratches along the mane and shoulder, much to the horse's delight.}

<A>__{the boy takes a few steps toward her, out of the shadows, but he seems more concerned about something in the ceiling than "connecting" with catherine. very anxiously, he looks at the wall behind catherine and watches an old wind up kitchen timer click down.}

<L>__{interior stargher's world the labyrinth}
<A>__{young stargher knows his way around the landscape, but catherine has difficulty simply keeping him in sight. she runs, climbs and crawls. until she's utterly lost and disoriented. tired and having difficulty breathing, she drops to her knees and "cools down." she hears a noise nearby, gets to her feet, and finds a geared mechanism connected to some kind of shuttered door composed of an almost metallic looking glass. curious yet cautious, she examines the nearby walls, floor, and ceiling for any signs of "traps" akin to the glass blades. finding none, she pulls the mechanism and quickly steps back. the shutter opens and catherine knows there's something alive in the tiny cubicle beyond. she retreats into shadow, hiding. released from the chamber is a woman. as she moves out of a darkness, we see victim one. ghostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb, she appears to "sense" the presence of a stranger, targets catherine in the shadows, and attacks! catherine's had enough and moves to press the implant, but the victim is already there! she brutally grabs catherine, throws her against the wall and smacks her head against it. catherine drops to the floor like a rag doll. victim one hefts catherine onto her shoulder and with great purpose, carries her deep into the labyrinth, toward the core. passing in and out of consciousness, between darkness and light, a dazed catherine is taken on a "tour" of stargher's world. passing mausoleum like chambers filled with images of unspeakable horror and or disturbing intensity. at one of the rooms, we think we see young stargher silently observing... sitting of standing in individual cubicles are stargher's other victims (two thru six), each woman resembling the grotesque porcelain dolls glimpsed in the cubbyholes in stargher's basement. dressed by a fetishistic sadist (nine inch nails meets the brides of dracula), they resemble bored housewives, barely acknowledging the new member of the "harem."}
<L>__{interior stargher's world the core}
<A>__{victim one drops catherine in the center of the room and, job done, crawls away. groggy, feeling sick, catherine sits up. unbeknownst to her, she is sitting at the base of a pedestal with her back to the kind of throne. and someone is there. in the dim pool of light above the pedestal, we see a man rise from the throne. the wall behind him is covered in blood red cloth, and as he descends, we realize it is a cape connected to eight metal rings pierced through the flesh of his back. in a fluid motion, waves of red give way to harshly textured concrete as the man reaches the floor. catherine knows he is there. unable to stop herself, she turns. and sees the terrifying face of stargher. but no the same stargher. this is stargher king.}

<C>__{cole}
<D>__{lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near delano. bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land it's just sitting there.}

<D>__{the exact location, cole. give it to me.}

<L>__{interior the cell day}
<A>__{julia is entirely underwater but alive. she uses the straw to suck oxygen through the gap in the ceiling, but it's difficult to tread water and her lungs are aching.}
<L>__{interior helicopter}
<A>__{novak uses binoculars to scan farmland. he searches. and there it is: the abandoned farmhouse!}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{take it down!}
<L>__{interior the cell day}
<A>__{julia tries to hold herself up by pressing her arms and legs against the walls, but as she does, the straw slips from her mouth. she reaches for it, but only succeeds in pushing it away from her. it heads for the drain. and disappears.}
<L>__{exterior abandoned farm house}
<A>__{the helicopter lands and novak jumps out. he knows this is the place. he runs into the barn, but there's nothing, no sign of her. the pilot looks at him with a true sense of loss.}
<L>__{interior the cell continuous}
<A>__{as julia desperately tires to find the straw through the tiny holes of the drain, we see for the first time an expression which tells us she's given up. thump thump thump. the cell starts to vibrate. a repetitive noise whup whup whup comes from above. she swims to the top of the cell and pounds at the ceiling.}
<L>__{exterior abandoned farm house}
<A>__{fighting exhaustion and the side effects of the drugs, novak pushes on. think, peter, think... his eyes find the water tanks and he shouts at the helicopter.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{cut the engine!}
<A>__{as the motor dies, novak listens and listens. there it is. water pipes beneath his feet. and very faintly, a pounding. he follows the sound, searching the earth. it's clearer now, louder. novak tosses aside rusted junk and the pilot runs to assist him. together, they expose the entrance to the underground sanctuary.}
<L>__{interior the cell observation room}
<A>__{novak drops to the floor below. instantly affected by the similarities and the differences to the idealized cell of stargher's mind, he feels another wave of dizziness, but pushes on. and is hit hard by the sight of drowned julia, her motionless body floating past him. her eyes open and bubbles drift from her nose and mouth. novak bangs on the plexiglas and calls to her.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{julia!}
<A>__{the thick plexiglass still remains, but she now can see him. novak pulls his id badge and smacks it against the glass.}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{move aside!}
<A>__{he pulls his gun and takes aim. julia swims to the top of the cell and presses herself against the ceiling. bang bang bang bang bang bang. novak fires a circle of shots into the thick plastic. water slowly leaks, but the damn thing is still solid. he lifts the industrial vcr and rams it at the bullet damaged section. crack! crash! water pours from the cell. julia's body descends on the torrent of water. novak reaches inside and pulls her to safety. he's just about to give her cpr when she coughs, sputters, and thirstily drinks in oxygen. holding her tightly, novak sinks to the floor, the water from the cell spilling everywhere.}

<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{i left the nutritional information on the fridge door. read it.}

<C>__{catherine}

<A>__{novak doesn't push it. he just takes her hand and gives it a gentle squeeze. the cat dashes into the kitchen and valentine follows.}

<D>__{they're hungry.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{i got it.}
<A>__{he moves into the kitchen. in a moment of quiet introspection, catherine looks at the television screen, at dorothy accidentally hitting the wicked witch with a bucket of water, causing her to melt. and she looks away, unable to watch, disturbed by the image. she turns to the kitchen and sees novak feeding an appreciative dog and cat. he rises and returns to the living room.}
