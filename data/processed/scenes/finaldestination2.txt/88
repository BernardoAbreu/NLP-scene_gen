<C>__{rescue worker}
<P>__{(dripping scorn)}
<D>__{sure, i will just set it to the "quiet" mode.}
<A>__{kat rescues the glowing cigarette from around her feet and inhales. ka chunk!!! she jumps again, but maintains her composure.}
<B>__{meanwhile}
<A>__{the gasoline purposefully trickles down corrugated steel, through pipes, closer and closer to the expedition. at one point, the gas even disappears into a hole in the ground, only to resurface twenty feet closer to the site...}

<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{so let's go...where the hell is rory?!}
<A>__{thomas sees rory in the field and angrily hops the fence, heading directly under the dead oak tree. rory, his back to everyone, finally opens the bindle. enraptured, he delicately unfolds it...}
<B>__{kimberly}
<A>__{is put on alert by a fresh breeze. her attention is caught by the window of an emergency vehicle. in the reflection, kimberly sees a man sitting on the expedition, but when she spins ar ound, there's no one there. ka chung! the door comes off the expedition, finally freeing kat! everyone applauds!}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{mr. gibbons, applauding with everyone else, chooses that very moment to sit on the bumper. deploying the airbag! slamming kat's head backwards through the spike, head kabob. kat's dead limp hand drops her last cigarette which bounces along the hard dirt toward the oncoming gas. closer, closer,.. the breeze kicks up, aiding the cigarette. whoosh, the gas fuse catches. the blusih flame travels through pipes, over rocks, racing toward the news van. kimberly , half traumatized, watches an ominous breeze rustle through the field, up to the trees, toward thomas. the gas burns up an incline, and disappears into the ground... and pops up twenty feet closer to the news van. kimberly follows the breeze to the dead oak tree under which thomas stands. and blows a large branch until it snaps! a startled thomas sees it fall just in time to dive to safety. clear, seeing the flame, instinctively runs from the van.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{get back!}
<A>__{boom! the news van's explosion hurls two fence posts just over thomas' head, end over end, the two lengths of wire stretched between them. the flying garrote heads directly for rory, who sorts hard, stands up with a satisfied smile and is sliced into three sharp cuts of beef. the silence from the emergency crew is deafening. mr. gibbons starts crying hysterically.}
<C>__{mr. gibbons}
<D>__{i didn't mean to do it i didn't know.}
<A>__{kimberly numbly stares at the fallen branch, the one that caused thomas to step out of the path of the flying fence.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{it wasn't his turn. and it's not my turn.}
<A>__{kimberly sees the corpses of kat and rory, buries the pain, and approaches mr. gibbons.}

<D>__{give me the keys to your truck. now!}
<C>__{mr. gibbons}
<P>__{(hysterical)}
