<L>__{interior hospital torture room day}
<A>__{close up on the girls' faces as the door closes in front of them. kirsty lets out a breath. then they hear the rattling sound behind them. they swing round and the camera pulls out to take in the room. it is like the torture room in hellraiser. the walls are black, the floor slimy, and the room filled with chains, hooks, and torture pillars. and, in the room and staring at the girls, are the four cenobites. pinhead glances theatrically around the room, as if checking something.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{oh. no boxes. such a shame.}
<C>__{female cenobite}
<D>__{no more delays, kirsty. no more teasing. time to play.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{time to play.}
<A>__{kirsty looks at his unforgiving face and then her eyes suddenly widen as she thinks of something.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{wait!}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{no more deals, kirsty. it's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{no deals! just information. information. free of charge. no strings. just information.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{go on. but trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in hell.}
<A>__{carefully, making no fast movements, kirsty reaches into her pocket where she placed the photograph from malahide's obsession room. she brings out the picture that she realized earlier was of pinhead and hands it to him. he takes hold of it and looks, his face registering nothing.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{what is this? someone else you think escaped us, like frank?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{no, no, this one didn't escape. you told me you'd always been in hell. you were wrong. look at it. look. it's you.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{nonsense, i...}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{it's you! you haven't always been as you are. you were human. remember. remember all your confusions. think!}
<A>__{the female cenobite strides across the room.}
<C>__{female cenobite}
<D>__{enough!}
<A>__{she raises her hand towards kirsty. pinhead's arm flies out and stops her.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{he is staring at the photograph, that great immobile brow finally puckering, as if something is stirring.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{i...remember.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{you were all human!}
<A>__{the other three cenobites stop moving and stare at kirsty. any advances they were making on kirsty or tiffany stop as the same dim, distant, recollection begins to stir within them. suddenly, the door bursts open. malahide is there, still floating, his voice still a mixture of hideous threat and insane joy.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{tiffany. come.}
<A>__{he turns his palms downwards, mirroring his gesture in the hall of mirrors. tiffany lets out a moan of terror and shakes her head. one of the snake like limbs from malahide's palms flies towards tiffany's face. before anybody can react, its scalpel tip has sliced an inch or so off several strands of her hair.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{tiffany. come.}
<A>__{kirsty throws her arms around the cowering tiffany and snarls at her tormentor.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{leave her alone, you asshole!}
<A>__{malahide makes no reply, but suddenly several more limbs fly towards the girls and begin to weave in front of kirsty's face like snakes awaiting their moment. at this stage, the camera cuts to the watching pinhead. he lets the photograph of his past life flutter to the floor. malahide looks up at the tiny noise this makes and his eyes meet pinhead's. he turns more fully to face pinhead and the other cenobites who are now standing with their leader, and a strange smile crosses his face}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{oh,good. a fight.}
<A>__{suddenly, the air is full of flying chains. malahide is hooked everywhere. it is like a high speed version of frank's final re capture in hellraiser. the chains start tugging almost instantly. is malahide about to be ripped apart? with contemptuous, dismissive speed, the limbs that ooze from malahide's palms have sliced the chains to pieces and, almost before we have time to realise that, three of them have lengthened, thickened, and hardened and have skewered the female cenobite, chatterer ii, and butterball to the walls. the three limbs detatch themselves from malahide. the three cenobites are all well above the floor, pinned and twitching like the rats in frank's attic. as they die, they suddenly revert; there are three human corpses on the walls of the room. a woman, a fat man, and a little boy. malahide smiles. be looks at pinhead again and advances. suddenly a heavy torture pillar smashes into him, knocking him slightly off balance. pinhead is backing across the room, weaving pillars in front of him as he moves. malahide moves forward, knocking them out of the way. as each pillar is knocked aside, pinhead's face is more and more human. finally, when the face we see is nearly that of the english officer from the opening, he turns his head slightly away from the advancing malahide and finds kirsty's eyes. a look passes between them. understanding? gratitude? friendship? whatever emotion lies beneath it, it is clearly a cue and kirsty and tiffany make a break for it, bursting through the door. simultaneously to this, malahide and pinhead find each other's eyes a final time. for a second, everything is still then a single bladed limb flies across the space between them and neatly and calmly slices pinhead's throat open. the thin red line becomes a torrent of blood and the former lord of hell falls dead at the feet of his successor.}
