<L>__{exterior beach}
<A>__{a campfire blazes only a few feet away from the high tide. a billion stars shine overhead as gregory and his biker gang, including the cop, sit or lie around the fire. a few people are still awake, and one picks drunkenly at a guitar. gregory stands, throws a blanket over his shoulder, and scoops up chandra. they make their way into the dunes.}
<L>__{exterior dunes}
<A>__{gregory and chandra lie on the blanket, staring at the sky. inexplicably, gregroy holds a hand toward the sky.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{which one do you want?}
<C>__{chandra}
<D>__{any one. it doesnt matter.}
<A>__{with his hand pointed lazily at the sky, a single star starts glowing stronger and stronger. it vibrates, then fades suddenly and comes loose from the sky, and becomes a meteorite, burning across the sky.}
<D>__{chandra draws closer to him, enraptured by his power.}
<C>__{chandra}
<D>__{how do you do it, gregory?}
<C>__{gregory}
<A>__{"i dont know. sometimes it feels like... im reaching beyond the}
<D>__{world."}
<A>__{his hand drops and his head turns. he sits up, startled by something.}
<C>__{chandra}
<D>__{what is it? gregory holds up a hand for her to be silent.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{they found us. cant you hear it?}
<C>__{chandra}
<D>__{what? i dont hear anything.}
<C>__{gregory}
<A>__{"we can only rebel so long. we can only push until they will hit}
<D>__{back."}
<C>__{chandra}
<D>__{they? the men in black?}
<A>__{cu on gregory. in the distance, the faintest sound of a helicopter can}
<D>__{be heard, growing louder.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{fuck! get to the bikes.}
