<A>__{they have ivan checkov tied down to the bar on his stomach. connor stands with an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips next to ivan. he pours hennessey all over checkov's buttocks. they all cheer. ivan's face is battered as rocco wakes and approaches. he punches checkov in the face in complete rage. two friends subdue him as all chuckle.}

<D>__{now, like my fine brother says, on st. patty's everyone's irish. and this piece of shit is about to be initiated.}
<A>__{as they cheer, connor lights up his smoke and tosses the match on ivan's butt. the hennessey is instantly ablaze and checkov is screaming and wiggling in horror. some just stand there stunned, but most of the remaining onlookers leap to ivan's aid. they furiously pat him out and turn on connor.}
