<A>__{maurice gently moves his hands under the bathtub head, checking the temperature. he sits on the edge of the tub. maurice peels off his shoes with great pain. they slide across the dull white tiles into the corner. the once well kept english loafers could be mistaken for trash now. maurice rubs his barefeet with both hands grimacing from the pain. the tub is almost filled. maurice stops the tap. the steam from the water fills the room. maurice raises his legs with great effort and submerges each leg into the steaming water. his eyes close with great relief as his body melts into the tub. maurice lays his head on the side of the tub... it only takes ten seconds before maurice's snoring fills the bathroom.}
