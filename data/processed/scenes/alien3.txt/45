<L>__{interior technology room reality day}
<A>__{ripley opens her eyes.}
<B>__{whoosh...whoosh...}
<A>__{she's still in the room with the windmills. somehow this place seems less real than her dream. she looks around: john is sitting next to her, writing on a piece of parchment. he smiles a relieved smile.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i thought we'd lost you.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what are you writing?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{last will and testament.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just kidding.}
<A>__{she looks to her left: anthony is lying on his back, cotton bandage wrapped around his eyes. his ankle is a swollen mess. wires are hanging out.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{is he ?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{resting.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{he'll be fine.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{no i won't. he's a terrible liar.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{it's ironic. i guess my visions were prescience after all. how will i ever resolve that with my artifical con science?}
<A>__{a creaking floorboard to ripley's right draws her attention to the abbot. he's pacing.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{do you see what you've delivered us into?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{yeah. lead me not into temptation to kick your ahh }
<A>__{ripley tries to stand her head spins.}
<B>__{whoosh...whoosh...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{oh shit.}
<A>__{the entire room throbs with the rhythm of the wind.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{where is the big boy ?}
<A>__{the abbot points to the door.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{on the other side of that door. waiting for us to starve to death.}
<A>__{ripley moves to the door and feels it's cold surface.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{it's playing with us. it could get in here any time it wants.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{why should he enter? he knows that one of the people in this room is in league with him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{sir. we're all in the same coracle, so to speak.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{maybe more than one of us.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{let's talk about the facts, mr. abbot.}
<A>__{she looks at the windmills.}
<B>__{whoosh...whoosh...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{this is your technology?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{even this is forbidden to us.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{well then, the facts are that we're screwed.}
<A>__{she moves into the room. walks around one of the windmills.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{an eco system. nothing to recycle your atmosphere except the green plants. winds generated down here }
<P>__{(looks at the floor)}
<D>__{windmills use the natural surface winds to turn wheels underground, create tides on the seas to recirculate your water...}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{more than that. there are pumps beneath the floor i can feel their vibration.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{probably pumping this air through charcoal filters.}
<B>__{whoosh...whoosh...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{it gets colder all the time here, right?}
<A>__{john looks at her questioningly.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{your wood burning fires throw soot into the atmosphere, building the cloud layer cutting off the sun's rays cooling the planet, forcing you to burn more wood.}
<B>__{whoosh...whoosh...}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{the greenhouse effect. it's how the earth almost destroyed itself in the late 20th century.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{don't you see? this is a planet set to self destruct. not in ten minutes or two hours but soon. your atmosphere here is finite. if the plants die the fires will eat up all the oxygen this planetoid will be dead everyone will die.}
<A>__{the abbot has the look of a man who has been beaten in the last few meters of a marathon.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{it's here. i was just hoping i would be dead long before it came to this.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{we're supposed to die here. that's the pointerior}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{wait a minute you were exiled ?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{the punishment for our crime was death.}
<A>__{anthony sits up.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{this planet is the supreme triumph of planned obsolesence. a certain amount of primitive materials with an atmosphere processing system as fragile as a real environment but not replenishable.}
<A>__{the abbot has a faraway look in his eyes...}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{poetic justice for the anti technologists. the company's best work. you know, i used to be a corporate executive. middle range v.p. then my wife got hit by a speed craft. i chucked it all and joined the order. be a monk see the world. being here, being chairman of the board...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{no, now i understand why i landed here. to join you happy lunatics in your deaths.}
<A>__{ripley moves away... john starts after her.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{ripley, wait }
<A>__{the abbot stands, blocks his way.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{where can she go? she's trapped.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{trapped inside her own prison. a prison in her mind. inside her mind. dancing. sparklets of light dance with the june bugs in the recesses of ourmindstheyare coming to danceintheshadowof...}
<A>__{john and ripley turn to look at the abbot. he begins to speak faster. faster. he shakes. vibrates is more accurate a trickle of blood runs from his left ear...}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{ridingthewildwindsofchangenoescapeno escapeforthewickedevilevilthynameis woman.woman.womanheiscoming.heiscoming foryouuuuuuuuu }
<A>__{splortch kt !! the abbot's head explodes !!! like a ripe melon dropped ten stories onto pavement. blood, bone, hair and brain matter spray john. john screams.}
<B>__{a horrible alien head burster}
<A>__{is all that sits atop the blood spurting neck of the abbot. it keeps it's hold on the abbot's spinal cord the abbot's body continues to stagger around, arms jerking mechanically as lack of fresh nerve impulses from the brain works its way through the system. ripley screams. the infant alien headed corpse stumbles towards her she plucks anthony's staff from the floor and swings like a child hitting a baseball from a tee whack k !! blasts the chest head burster across the room it hits the floor scrambling. scuttles down into where the windmills meet the floor. disappears.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{bastard!! it came out of his fucking head!}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i didn't have to see that to know what that means.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{he sent him to us. that bastard outside. i can't get away from him. he's fucking with my mind. he's my punishment!}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i'm confused. before you said it came out of the torso, not the head }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i don't feel like a discussion of alien biology.}
<A>__{john comes up next to her.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{ripley, don't }
<A>__{she pushes him away and sinks to the floor.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i should just wait for the air to run out...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i believe i know that we can win there is an answer in our books.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{your books? your books are gone, brother. your world is gone. once that thing starts to lay its eggs, all your brothers if they aren't already are dead.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{if that's true, then all of us, the books, are consigned to ashes.}
<A>__{he clasps his hands and bows his head. the abbot's blood drips off his hands. plip plop! into a little puddle at ripley's feet. she stares at the blood. aahk. feels the pain again. runs her hand across her chest...}
<D>__{anthony o s ripley?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{there are several inconsistancies between this and the other aliens you described.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{give it up.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i think this is important. this may help us fight it. the creature that i fought in the hall when i first saw it, it had camoflaged itself to look like wood.}
<A>__{ripley looks up.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{wood? when i saw it in my room it looked the way it did before black, mechanical unless that was a dream.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i don't think it was. i think that this creature, if it is the efficient predator that you say it is, has the ability to adapt to its environment.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{then the reason they've always looked the same to me is that i only ever saw them in the same environment.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{or this may be an as yet unseen stage of development you saw a queen this could be like a king ant more highly advanced than the drone, bred for survival ?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{how does this explain the thing that came out of the ewe's chest? the abbot's head?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{maybe it can deposit different types of eggs. the chest burster is probably dormant until the host eats the first one i ever saw came out of kane after he started to eat }
<A>__{and in one horrible moment she realizes: she hasn't eaten. the pain in her chest...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{anthony "looks" towards her does he realize as well?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no what?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{no, we're not beat yet, father }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{brother }
<A>__{ripley gets up.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{brother. not yet. if he's taunting me, then maybe we can use that. we can beat this bastard. we can get to my ship. we can live.}
