<L>__{exterior prison grounds dawn}
<A>__{night has passed, day is coming. all the earlier energy has dissipated into anticlimax and weariness. people straggle across the yard in groups toward their vehicles... nick, dunnigan, davies, iger all look whipped. sarah approaches, briefcase in hand, files under her arm.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{we dug pretty deep for one night. still got a ways to go, but on a first look? nothing. nada. zip.}
<C>__{iger}
<D>__{well, that's good news.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{so far. now we double down. make absolutely certain.}
<P>__{(nods after adas)}
<D>__{let them all sleep a few hours, then bring 'em back for round two.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{due diligence. my middle name.}
<A>__{she trudges toward her car, following the adas toward their vehicles. nick trades relieved looks with the men everybody coming down from a tense night. davies shakes their hands:}
<C>__{davies}
<D>__{fellas. for once, glad not to be of assistance.}
<C>__{dunnigan}
<D>__{love it when they cry wolf.}
<A>__{the men separate in different directions. dunnigan catches a glimpse of sarah almost at her car she loses a page from under her arm, which flutters away on the breeze.}
<C>__{dunnigan}
<P>__{(calls to her)}
<D>__{miss lowell! lost something!}
<A>__{she looks back, sees the page skittering slowly across the ground. weary, she blows a strand of hair from her eyes, sets down her briefcase, walks back to get it... dunnigan smiles, keeps walking. the other men too. nick stands a moment, watching, then starts toward his car... the adas are getting to their cars, pulling key fobs, aiming them to unlock their cars... sarah is getting to the page, leaning down... the adas are pressing the remotes, a chorus of chirps... and wham the cars explode in a stunning series of detonations, killing the adas, throwing bodies through the air, kicking cars off the ground and flipping a few skyward... nick is knocked flat by heat and shrapnel ripping the air... sarah goes flying. an arcing car slams upside down nearby on a rocket booster of flame and shattering axle... and from this point on the visuals and sound are surreal:}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{pries himself off the ground, stunned, looking around, trying to figure out what the fuck just happened. he's disoriented, all sound muffled. smoke drifting. flames billowing. dunnigan runs up to nick, shouting something. we can't tell what, because nick can't hear. dunnigan sees nick is alive, turns and keeps going, running to help the others... nick looks over, sees bodies being pulled clear by responders, men running in, beating at flames... nick, dazed, looks through the drifting smoke and sees sarah trying to sit up. there's something wrong with her leg. nick pulls himself to his knees, staggers to his feet as sound filters back in: screams, shouts, the roar of flames. he stumbles through the smoke to sarah. she's on the ground in shock, sobbing and flailing, crying out. nick sees the jagged piece of metal that slammed deep into her calf, nearly severing it. he drops to his knees, tries to calm her:}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you're gonna be all right.}
<A>__{he pulls the metal from her leg mistake. blood sprays. he clamps down hard with both hands, blood going everywhere.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{medic! i need a medic!}
<A>__{he keeps clamping down, sarah screaming and sobbing, as we}
