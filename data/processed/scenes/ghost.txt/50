<A>__{sam and the mugger approach a tenement building at 321 prospect place.}
<L>__{interior tenement hallway day}
<A>__{sam follows the mugger into the building and watches as he opens the mail box for apt. 4d. the name scribbled across it is willie lopez. there's no mail.}
<L>__{interior willie's apartment day}
<A>__{sam enters willie's apartment. it is a squalid affair. peeled paint chips litter the floor. the bed is unmade. willie pulls open a drawer in a small nightstand and drops in the keys to molly's loft. sam sees his wallet. his driver's license, bank id, and a photo of molly are there, too. furious, sam lunges for willie but then holds his punch, knowing it will have no effect. he turns instead to a window and, like the ghost on the subway, smashes it with his fist. nothing happens.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{damn!}
<A>__{willie dials the phone. someone comes on the line.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{she came home. i couldn't get it. give me a couple of days. i will go back.}
<A>__{he hangs up. sam stares at him in wild confusion.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{get what? who the hell are you? what were you doing at molly's? what the hell's going on?}
<A>__{willie grabs a bottle of wine from the nightstand and lies down. after a moment he reaches over and takes molly's photo from the drawer. he studies it slowly. sam stands by the door in a state of motionless rage. there is nothing he can do.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{stay away from her!}
