<A>__{we see all the elements of the first day of school. the students carry new books, explore new lockers, begin to stake out their ground. someone has taken the steel letters from the green vanguard out front. it reads: "idg mon senor hi ho." the rest of ridgemont high is covered with toilet paper. and a black spray paint message along the side of the front office building reads, "lincoln surf nazis."}
