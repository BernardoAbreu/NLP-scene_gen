<C>__{corky }
<D>__{when i'm inside, i will get the money.}
<A>__{from her earlobe, she chooses the right pick, sliding out the silver tool. it takes only a second and the first lock pops open. she is working on the other lock when the door is pushed open and caesar walks in. corky drops down, grasping for her gun as caesar, wearing only underwear, enters. he blows on the drying polish on his fingernails before delicately selecting a suit from his closet. the gun ready, corky, pressed against the desk, waits until he leaves. she lets her breath out, then pops the second lock, unzips the black duffel bag and quickly empties the case, filling the bag with fat money bricks.}
