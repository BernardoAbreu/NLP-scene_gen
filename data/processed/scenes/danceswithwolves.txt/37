<L>__{exterior prairie day}
<A>__{dunbar is walking through a little valley of tall, rich grass. the wagon is nowhere in sight. he looks back at cisco who is also wandering by himself searching for prime shoots. timmons' wagon comes into view now.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{how come we haven't seen any buffalo?}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{can't figger the stinkin' buffalo. sometimes you don't see 'em for days, sometimes they're thick as curls on a whore.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{what about indians?}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{goddamn indians you'd jus' as soon not see, lessen the bastards're dead. nothing but thieves and beggars.}
<A>__{timmons, as usual, laughs at his own imagined wit. the wagon disappears over a ridge and again, dunbar is alone. in gentle awe, he runs his palm over the top of the grass swirling about his waist. a meadow lark's mournful call startles him. dunbar brings his head up at the sound and so does cisco. now there's a sudden lifting of the breeze. it sweeps through the valley, making the grass roll with a life of its own. the lark's sad call and the sudden violent movement of the wind sends a shudder through lieutenant dunbar. he scans the horizon in all directions, aware all at once of his aloneness. he flips the reins over cisco's neck and sticks a foot in the stirrup. dunbar heads for the ridge.}
