<L>__{interior brian and carrie's loft apartment later that night}
<A>__{a door swings open spilling light into a darkened room. brian and carrie, a little drunk, return home from the party. their apartment is in an old converted industrial building in a funky low rent part of town. brian walks ahead, carrie trails behind him, peeling off her clothes. she begins unzipping her dress, unnoticed by brian.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{the party?}
<A>__{she grabs a leather cap that sits on a chair.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{the warehouse. i'm not that drunk.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{it was definitely the high point of the evening.}
<A>__{carrie's dress falls to the floor.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(getting excited)}
<D>__{just being there where it really happened. it was different... more visceral.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{mmm... i love it when you talk like that.}
<A>__{brian is at the foot of the bed, he turns to see... carrie has transformed. she has stripped down to her black bra and panties, fishnet stockings, a nightporter style leather cap. a surprised brian stands there a moment. looking at carrie. she looks great.}
<A>__{carrie pushes brian back onto the bed.}
<A>__{carrie climbs on top of him. she kisses his neck. slowly starts working her lips across his chest and down his stomach.}
