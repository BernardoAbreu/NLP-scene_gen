A shadow moves by the WINDSHIELD and she gasps- As another shadow goes by in a blur past the BACK WINDOW and he gasps- The assault coming from everywhere at once now, the cop an elemental force, like the storm itself. Skittering along the undercarriage one moment, across the metal roof the next. Even appearing -- fleetingly, impossibly -- in the snow on the blocked driver's side window. All the electronics in the car start going crazy, power locks opening and closing, the interior light flickering, the dashboard clock hands spinning wildly, the windshield wipers sweeping back and forth, etc. Then stop all at once. Even the radio SNAPS OFF. Dead silence for a beat. Then an odd SCUTTLING SOUND underfoot, something crawling along the undercarriage of the car. Our guy sits there frozen with fear, too scared to move, to even breathe. Likewise, the girl sits nervously, watching her breath in the cold. Her eyes happen to wander to the rear view mirror- A blue-faced DEAD BABY stares back at her from the rear window ledge. She SWINGS around, looks back at the window.   But nothing's there. She turns back, he looks at her with concern. Unsure of her own senses, she shakes him off. Exhales slowly. Beat. Suddenly the scuttling noises outside EXPLODE into to a full- blown assault. There's the shriek of RENDING METAL, the thing outside begins HAMMERING at the car's hood, doors, etc. The car gives a violent shudder side-to-side tosses our kids around like plastic flakes in a snow globe. The radio snaps back on: the saxophone solo in the Brenda Lee song, accompanying the violent CLANGS and GROANS of metal being torn asunder as the thing under the car rips away muffler, brake lines, wrenches the handles from the doors, etc.}
