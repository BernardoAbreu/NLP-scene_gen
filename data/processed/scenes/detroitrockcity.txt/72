<L>__{interior w.a.r.p. tower elevator night}
<A>__{hawk, trip, lex, and jam ride back down the elevator sipping nehi sodas, watching the floor numbers get lower and lower. terry jack's immortal hit "seasons in the sun" plays over the elevator speaker.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{well, here we are, dudes. one hour and thirty minutes away from the concert of the century... ticketless. all thanks to wile e. coyote, super fucking genius over here.}
<A>__{trip looks away from the rest, ashamed.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{really, trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{fuck you, lex! this whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. i just made an honest mistake.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry, trip. what you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. no offense.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{guys, guys! come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. i was the one who grabbed trip's jacket by mistake. it's my fault and i apologize.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{please, jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?}
<A>__{jam looks at his feet.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{sometimes i think i don't deserve friends as good as you guys.}
<A>__{hawk, trip, and lex cringe.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i have one question. how could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{really, jam, you tryin' to make us barf?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{yeah, it's like you're possessed by the flying nun, or something.}
<A>__{the doors to the elevator open and the boys step out.}
<D>__{shake your weewee!}
