<L>__{interior the blood boudoir day}
<A>__{the camera follows kyle into the room. he reaches the middle before horror and disgust stop him. he hears a click behind him and turns to see julia has come into the room and closes the door behind her. she looks at kyle.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{was i right? is it terrible?}
<A>__{kyle stares all around him. all eight victims have been sucked dry. he is surrounded by dead husks. his face is ghastly. he looks like he is about to fainterior he nods. his voice is a cracked whisper.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{yes. yes, it's terrible.}
<A>__{julia crosses the room rapidly towards him. her face is a picture of concern.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{oh. you look awful. you poor boy. come here...}
<A>__{as she speaks, julia's arms are opening out to him. kyle sees the comfort offered and advances towards her, too. as they come together, the camera moves around them and we see, for the first time, that julia is still incomplete; her entire back is still glistening raw flesh, the naked bones of the spine still clearly visible. their arms go around each other just as julia completes her speech;}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{...come to mother ...}
<A>__{as kyle's hands touch the sticky, mucoid meat of her shoulders, it is instantly clear to him what has happened. for a moment he freezes in terror. his arms fly from her and he throws his head back. but julia is very strong now and her grip does not relax. kyle's expression is a mixture of terror and confusion as he stares into the beautiful face of the monster. julia smiles at him, a hungry, aroused smile.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<A>__{kyle can hardly speak for fear.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{kyle...}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{i'm julia.}
<A>__{she raised one hand from his back to the back of his head and presses his face to hers. julia plays it exactly as a sensual, passionate kiss, her mouth wide open, her head moving rhythmically and sinuously. kyle's reaction is somewhat different; his arms flail in panic (though only from the elbow julia's grip prevents anything more) and his head makes jerking, backward movements against her pressing hand. the camera moves around the embracing couple until it is behind}
<B>__{julia.}
<A>__{the back of her gown, as we know, is extremely low. as the kiss continues, we see skin creeping above the line of the gown at the base of her spine and gradually flowing up her back until finally it meets and blends perfectly with ragged and raw edges of the skin at her neck and shoulders. julia is complete again. while this process has been going on, kyle has been dying slowly and horribly in her arms, his lifeforce being sucked into her through their open mouths. his body, by the time her back is completely formed, is shrunken, hollow, and dried up. julia takes her arms from around the corpse of kyle and steps back, allowing the husk to fall to the floor. julia licks her lips and looks down, not without affection, at the dead kyle. she smiles.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{thank you, kyle.}
