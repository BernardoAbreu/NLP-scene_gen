<TRANS>__{FADE IN:}
<ACTION_ALT>__{SUNSET}
<ACTION>__{The glowing orb ripples like a blood-red eye. BLACK, ROBED FIGURE A face of the ages. Dark, wrinkled skin. Wizened, almond eyes. He howls at the sun. His voice ECHOES across the sky. The Moslem call to prayer. Hundreds of feet below his tower, a mud-walled city of minarets and mosques. A human ants' nest. Scurrying to their devotions.}
<LOC>__{EXT. TWELFTH-CENTURY ARAB CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOT INT. DUNGEONS - SUNSET}
<ACTION>__{Pervasive blackness. Moans of men in pain. Dripping water. Rats. Filth. The nadir of human degradation. Bedraggled white men, POWs from the Crusades, caged together with Arab cutthroats. Jailers wrench two crusaders from their cell. ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY and PETER DUBOIS. Their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their faces. Peter is so frail he can barely walk.}
<LOC>__{INT. TORTURE CHAMBER - SUNSET}
<ACTION>__{A furnace. Torture instruments glow red hot. Chained victims. A massive INTERROGATOR scrutinizes the two white men. Indicates a rat-faced lowlife, who points at Peter, jabbering in Arabic.}
<CHAR>__{INTERROGATOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He says you stole his bread.}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It is a lie. I caught him stealing ours.}

<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's not true.}
<CHAR>__{ROBIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{They're not interested in truth. You are too weak, Peter. You would not live through it.}

<CHAR>__{INTERROGATOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sacrifice for the weaker? How noble... As you wish... Cut off this one's hand as well!... But first...}
<ACTION>__{He indicates an Arab prisoner, who is dragged forward. His struggling hand is laid on the executioner's block.}
<CHAR>__{INTERROGATOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Show them the courage of Allah.}
<ACTION>__{The prisoner's face braces for the pain. A red-hot scimitar flashes down. The hand flips into a basket. Twitching. Robin is next. His composure fails. He flops to his knees, crying. The Interrogator laughs. The jailers unlash the thongs on Robin's hand. They stretch it out, forcing it down. Robin goes limp, sobbing. Peter catches his eye... Robin winks. The scimitar. Drawn from the coals. Spitting flame. Arcs down. Robin is suddenly galvanized.}
<CHAR>__{ROBIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And this is English courage.}
<ACTION>__{He hurls his holders aside. Swings upward, driving his fast into the executioner's throat. Grabs the sword. Slash. His thongs melt like butter. A jailer leaps at him. Steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest. Despite his bindings, Peter wrestles the Interrogator. Knife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the furnace. At the last second, he flips the man into the fire. Screaming.}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's for five years of hell.}
<ACTION>__{A jailer aims a scalding blade at Robin's back.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(O.S.)}
<DIAL>__{Behind you!}
<ACTION>__{Warned, Robin ducks away.    Slams the jailer's head into the wall. Peter frees himself, but they are still outnumbered. While fighting, Robin acknowledges the man who shouted the warning. An imposing, shaven-headed SARACEN. Heavily-muscled arms and chest, covered in tattoos. Even his bald head is ornamented.}

<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't trust him.}
<ACTION>__{Two more guards attack, yelling fury.    Robin eyes the curved scimitar.}
<CHAR>__{ROBIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What I would give for an English sword. This is a pruning hook.}
<ACTION>__{A guard swings at him with a giant axe.    Robin slashes... shears the axe handle in two.}
<CHAR>__{ROBIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hmm!   Not bad.}
<ACTION>__{He runs the man through. Peter loses his sword. His opponent moves in for the kill... Peter grabs tongs from the fire and smolders his opponent with a backhand. Commotion outside.    RAISED VOICES and RUNNING FEET.}
<CHAR>__{SARACEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Free me and I will show you a way out.}

<DIAL>__{A good point.}

<DIAL>__{This way!}
<ACTION>__{He beckons them to the back.     A hidden door leads into a tunnel.}
<LOC>__{INT. SEWERS - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{They wade through foul water up to their waists. The Saracen leads... A snake lashes out for his face. Robin lops off its head.}
<CHAR>__{SARACEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You are fast, my friend.}
<CHAR>__{ROBIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Five years I've waited for the smell of free air. That makes a man fast.}
<ACTION>__{Guards drop down from above, carrying torches.    Blocking the way.}
<CHAR>__{SARACEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You will need to be yet faster.}
<ACTION>__{A narrow opening to their left... they splash through. Half running, half crawling in the dank water. Fire arrows land around them. The orange smoke is choking.}
<CHAR>__{SARACEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Poison air.   Hold your breath.}
<ACTION>__{Flames illuminate the walls, alive with a loathsome mass of crawling slime. Peter falls. A pursuer descends on him, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. The Saracen intercepts the blow. Grabs the man's neck, SNAPPING it with one mighty twist.}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(coughing)}
<DIAL>__{Thanks. I misjudged you.}
<CHAR>__{SARACEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Save your breath.}
<ACTION>__{Gasping for air, they find the tunnel veers steeply down- ward. A slippery, granite tube. Losing purchase, they slide headlong. Sharp, rusted spikes jut out from the walls ahead. Robin grabs at the walls to break the fall. No use. They're picking up speed. He turns his sword crossways, bracing it against the sides of the tunnel, as a brake. Sparks fly. The sword cuts into Robin's chest... but it works.}
<CHAR>__{SARACEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Allah be praised.}
<CHAR>__{ROBIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Amen, brother.}
<ACTION>__{A bloodcurdling scream. A pursuing guard tumbles down the sewer chute. The three men press themselves against the wall. The man hurtles by... is impaled on the spikes. A draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. Using the spiked guard as a ladder, Robin climbs. Removes a grating.}
<LOC>__{EXT. ARAB STREET - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Robin's head appears... ducks back down, as a squad of mounted soldiers thunders right over him... he reappears. All clear. They're outside the prison wall. Robin helps Peter up.}
<CHAR>__{ROBIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{God willing, we may now be safe.}
<ACTION>__{Swoosh. An arrow pierces through Peter's chest -- fired from the prison wall. He reels... Robin leads him under the wall for protection. Shouts of alarm. Soldiers approaching.}
<CHAR>__{ROBIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come, Peter.    We must hurry.}
<ACTION>__{Raising his sword, Peter faces the oncoming soldiers.}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It is mortal.    Leave me.}
<CHAR>__{ROBIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hold on to my shoulder.}
<ACTION>__{Peter shakes him off.}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{My mother... my little sister. Tell them I love them. Tell them I died a free Englishman.}
<ACTION>__{Robin looks despairingly to the Saracen.}
<CHAR>__{SARACEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{His wound is by the heart.    We cannot save him.}
<ACTION>__{Robin knows it's true. Peter pulls an insignia ring from a hidden pouch in his clothes. Thrusts it into Robin's hand.}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Take this to my sister. Swear you will protect her for me... Swear it, Robin!}
<CHAR>__{ROBIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(reluctantly)}

<DIAL>__{Come now! Do not fail your friend. Make his sacrifice an act of honor.}

<CHAR>__{ROBIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Farewell, friend. God speed you on your way.}
<CHAR>__{SARACEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Our way is together. With the speed of Allah.}

<CHAR>__{ROBIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I go to England.}
<CHAR>__{SARACEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then I go to England.}

<DIAL>__{And if I don't want you?}
<CHAR>__{SARACEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You have no choice... unless you think you can kill me.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{LOCKSLEY.}
<ACTION>__{Seated at a table, wine goblet in hand, he pores   over a wonderful illustrated Bible. Reading to himself    for solace and strength. Empty chairs surround the    vast table. A deep sense of loneliness. He glances     at a portrait over the fireplace... Robin. The dog jumps. Hackles rise. O.S. SHOUTS. Locksley unsheathes a dagger. Obscures it in the folds of the Bible. The door bursts open. A peasant, ragged, desperate, KENNETH.}
<CHAR>__{KENNETH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{My Lord!   Help me.}

<DIAL>__{Nearby the Gregor Caves.}
<ACTION>__{Locksley reacts -- a hint of fear. They move on... Ahead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light. Strange primitive CHANTS, wafted on the wind. Locksley ties his nervous horse to a tree. Parting undergrowth, Kenneth creeps forward. Cries out. He's face to face with the maggot-eaten skull of a goat. Beyond it, a gruesome host of half-skinned human skulls, all arranged on stakes. Some male, others with rotting female tresses, staring eyelessly into the night. Kenneth turns to run... A hand grabs him.}

<DIAL>__{Gwen?}
<ACTION>__{Kenneth nods. The Demon shrieks, dervishing around GWEN, who  is carried onto the central plinth stone. A pagan   altar, the shape of an elephant's head with its trunk  raised. A masked figure stands at the head of the altar.   The high priest of the dark rite. The girl's body shudders as blood-red liquid is forced down her throat. The Demon's voice is husky and hideous.}
<CHAR>__{DEMON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come, my virgin flower.}
<ACTION>__{Hypnotized by the creature's voice and snake-like move- ments, Gwen stretches herself out. A single beam of sunlight slices through the mist, like a laser. The first light of the rising sun, it strikes directly on the altar, tracking down towards the girl's heart. The Demon's raised talons close in on the white flesh of her neck. Gwen's eyes are open wide, in a trance. The crowd of revelers encircle the plinth. Awed anticipation... A warrior's yell! Sword raised, Locksley THUNDERS in on his CHARGER. The terrified crowd parts. The Demon screams like a banshee.}

<CHAR>__{LOCKSLEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<ACTION>__{His broadsword swings in a mighty arc. Slices across the gargoyle's skull. Clean through half the face... Impossibly, the demon rolls back to its feet. The head is an elaborate mask -- beneath are the yellow skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino crone. Screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed. Momentarily stunned, Locksley regains his senses, hauls the girl onto his charger. The guards close in. Locksley spurs his horse. Rides for an opening. The masked high priest stands resolutely in his path. Brandishing a burning branch. The horse is freaked. Rears. Locksley and the girl are thrown. Unarmed, Locksley charges the man. Slams him into the cave wall. The mask falls. Locksley gasps in recognition.}
