<A>__{ big boom of close in shells. as haytham throws it in reverse and punches, the front of the rover shreds. the windshield bursts. engine dies: tachometer and speedometer needles bottom out instantly. haytham and al ghazi tuck into the dash. fleury tries to get as close to the backseat floor panels as possible. janet covers sykes. a thump thump thump can be heard on the roof: a grenade thrown with too much arm by the guy sykes spotted bounces off the roof and into the land cruiser. frantic, fleury swats it out. the blast releases a massive airburst and bits of shrapnel into the vehicle, starring windows, rocking it: creak of shocks and struts. fleury lifts up now, grabs the m 4: returns fire indiscriminately through the windows at any and all surrounding rooftops. that provides cover and reminds everyone in the car they're armed. janet exits with a rifle: firing out the back door, more covering fire. civilians who were ready to see a massacre scurry now that it's a fight.}
