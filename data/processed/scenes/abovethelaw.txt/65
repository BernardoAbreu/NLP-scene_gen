<L>__{interior fbi office night}
<A>__{opening on salvano, in a chair, looking bruised and swollen, and wearing an expression of fuming indignation.}
<C>__{salvano}
<D>__{ i will tell you what this cop is. he's a fucking menace!}
<A>__{two fbi agents (neeley and halloran) face salvano, chi chi and the lawyer abandano (apparently representing salvano and chi chi). neeley is on the phone. pictures of reagan and meese are prominent on the wall.}
<C>__{salvano}
<D>__{you see what he did to me?!}
<C>__{agent halloran}
<D>__{your problem is being handled right now, mr. salv }
<C>__{salvano}
<D>__{yeah? well, it shoulda been handled twelve hours ago. i don't know who's running this outfit, but somebody better get his goddamn wires straight!}
<C>__{agent neeley}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{ yes, sir... yes, sir, i understand }
<C>__{salvano}
<D>__{that maniac should be wearing a number, not a badge.}
<A>__{salvano knows what the call is about. he straightens the tie beneath his bruised neck, assuming the attitude of a respectable citizen who has been unjustly wronged.}
<C>__{agent neeley}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{ count on it, sir. right. you'll have our full cooperation.}
<A>__{neeley hangs up. glances dubiously to halloran. then turns grimly to salvano, chi chi and the lawyer abandano.}
<C>__{agent neeley}
<D>__{you're free to go.}
