<A>__{watts shocks awake. gasping. she lies in dim green light on the corrugated black deck of the juggernaut. a corridor. not far away, the doorway david opened to the navigation chamber. a spasm of disgust crosses her face. she gags and spits: a viscous fluid drips from her mouth in strings. a dead facehugger lies belly up beside her. the implications slam home. her face fills with horror. she rises, shakily. looks at the facehugger. feels the neck ring of her vacuum suit. looks around. no sign of her helmet. there's no sign of david. silently she steals away.}

<A>__{ravel and chance toil away at the terraforming engine. ray stands guard wearily: bored, he watches ravel and chance working more than he watches the shadows. watts emerges from the rampway to the catacombs. bare headed and sweaty she steals through the darkness to her rover. slips into the cab and activates the air reserves. the doors seal; air cycles. ray turns in surprise as the rover speeds off.}
