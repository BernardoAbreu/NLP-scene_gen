<L>__{exterior ditch day}
<A>__{lester pops into the ditch. one of his cult members is waiting with a car, and looking hopeful. lester sadly shakes his head "no."}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior lester's shrine room day}
<A>__{the cult members mill about, drinking coffee, chatting. lester enters with the cult member who picked him up at the ditch. all quiet down and look over at him.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{thank you all for your efforts, but i'm afraid we can no longer get into malkovich through the portal.}
<C>__{lotte}
<P>__{(panicky)}
<D>__{why not? i need to get in there!}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i'm not certain, my dear, but i believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{that bastard! i will gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, son of malkovich.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel. man #3}
<P>__{(raises hand)}
<D>__{oooh, i got an idea! what if we build another portal to malkovich, like around back, and sneak in that way? man #4 only captain mertin knew how to build a portal, dummy, and he's dead!}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{actually, my friends, i suppose its time i told you, i'm captain james mertin.}
<A>__{the members fall into a stunned silence. lester takes some refrigerator magnets and spells out l e s t e r on a board. he then rearranges them for a while.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{you see, lester is an anagram for mertin.}
<A>__{lester continues to rearrange the letters, getting a little tense now.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{it used to work, i'm sure of it.}
<A>__{several members check their watches.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{oh, damn it to hell. anyway, i am.}
<A>__{l e s t e r has been left as e l r e s t as lester turns from the board to face the congregation.}
<D>__{man #3 how can this be? i thought you were only one hundred and five years old. mertin would have to be...}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(chuckles amiably)}
<D>__{i'm two hundred and five, truth be told. woman #1}
<P>__{(flirtatiously)}
<D>__{you don't look a day over one hundred and five, captain. what's your secret?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{lots of carrot juice, little lady. that, and a deal with the devil.}
<A>__{there is a lot of murmuring in the room now.}
<D>__{man #2 so what exactly are you saying? are we in cahoots with the dark master here?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{surprise.}
<A>__{the cultists get tense, start to leave en masse.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{wait! it's not that bad! when we get into malkovich, we still get to rule the world, just like i told you. the only difference is that we rule in the name of evil, instead of good.}
<A>__{people stop in their tracks.}
<D>__{man #3 that's the only difference?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<A>__{the cultists think about is, then shrug and stay put.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{so anyway...}
<A>__{lotte stands.}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{well, i for one, am resigning. i will not serve evil. i am ashamed of all of you.}
<A>__{lotte heads for the door.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{my dear, let me assure you that when we attain power, it will be much more pleasant for those inside malkovich, than for those outside.}
<A>__{lotte stops and turns.}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{i will take my chances.}
<A>__{she exits.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{anybody else? woman #1 do we get to wear a crown?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{but of course. woman #1 count me in.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{good. i think its time to beckon mr. flemmer. perhaps he can help us out of this pickle.}
