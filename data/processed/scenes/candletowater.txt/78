<D>__{all my life. imagine living a lie forever. not just the lies everybody lives day to day to get by, play the game; but one big lie that stretches from beginning to end: a truth so hideous that it could be called ordinary. a verity of the genes, of psychology. and then imagine the one person the liar could turn to turning away, so that the liar was left with nothing but the lie. imagine exploding with the desire to be what you are, to be real, and to be accepted for what you are, perhaps even loved. not loved with money for playing games, but loved with respect for having the strength to stand apart. imagine that. but the works of the imagination must cede to that we call reality.}
