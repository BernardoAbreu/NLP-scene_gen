<A>__{a small, two story house amid a suburban neighborhood of other two story houses. uninspired architecture. spindly trees. two car garage. a faint yellow glow emanates from a cellar window across which shadows frantically dart. over the crickets, we hear muffled, badly rendered rock 'n' roll. scratchy, guttural, inhuman. camera moves to the cellar window. inside we see four teenage boys who are to blame for the racket. band practice.}
