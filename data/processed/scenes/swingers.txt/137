<A>__{the couple's dance is cut short as there were only a few bars left of the slow ballad. mike smiles politely in relief and begins to lead lorraine off the floor. she pulls him back. he's not getting off that easy. she wants a whole song. he politely holds her, poised for another slow number. they're alone on the floor. much to mike's dismay, the song begins with a driving tom tom solo. this cues every hep cat in the derby that the big one's coming. they all flood the floor for the last dance of the night. mike pleadingly shakes his head at lorraine. it's too fast. her eyes narrow as her grip tightens. no sympathy here. the band breaks into the full tilt swing number and the dance floor writhes around them. they stand motionless for what seems like an eternity. gut check. fuck it. sink or swim. mike grabs her like a man grabs a woman. it's just a simple six count swing step, but they're in perfect harmony. mike and lorraine look into each others eyes. it's on, baby. as mike's courage grows, the moves start to flow. a spin at first. then a double twirl. it's not long before he's throwing her through combinations that stand out even among the pros.}
