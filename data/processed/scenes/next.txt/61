<L>__{exterior maxwell gorge night}
<A>__{slowly making his way through the steep redwood covered slopes, cris hears a noise. looks up. sees a state police suv crashing down the cliff across the gorge.}
<T>__{snapback to:}
<A>__{maxwell gorge now cris, catching his breath against a redwood, opens his eyes and looks back toward his approaching pursuers. he looks around the gorge, searching for the cliff where he foresaw the suv come crashing down. he recognizes the rock formations across the gorge. he heads in that direction. pan up and we see that the cliff is directly under the... stakeout site baines steps closer to the edge and looks down.}
<C>__{baines}
<D>__{he's heading this way.}
<A>__{ferris, suddenly confident, shouts into the radio.}
<D>__{ferris cavanaugh! we've got a fox hunt going in maxwell gorge, right beneath the stakeout. throw everybody into it! we need to overload him!}
<A>__{liz looks around for some way to help. she spots the state police suv that we saw crashing down the hillside. she sidles toward it.}
<B>__{maxwell gorge}
<A>__{thirty troopers and six mp's are converging on cris.}
<P>__{ferris (o.c.)}
<D>__{gentlemen, if he surrenders, fine, cuff him. but if he even shivers, shoot to kill.}
<A>__{stakeout site liz opens the door of the suv, shifts into neutral, and starts pushing. it's too heavy to budge.}
<B>__{maxwell gorge}
<A>__{cris moves toward a field of large boulders. stakeout site slowly, with great effort, liz gets the suv to inch forward.}
<B>__{maxwell gorge}
<A>__{troopers and mp's are closing in on cris.}
<D>__{cavanaugh}
<P>__{(megaphone)}
<D>__{lie down on your stomach, hands behind your head! you've got ten seconds. ten seconds and we shoot.}
<A>__{cris climbs in among the large boulders, glances up, and waits for the future to happen. stakeout site liz gets the suv onto a slight downslope, and it picks up speed. baines and ferris see the suv rumbling straight toward them. they dive out of the way as the suv plunges over the ledge.}
<B>__{maxwell gorge}
<A>__{troopers and mp's are advancing toward cris, about to open fire.}
<C>__{cavanaugh}
<D>__{this is your last warning.}
<A>__{thirty troopers and mp's have their fingers on the trigger when the suv sails over the ledge and plummets straight down towards them. cris crouches down among the boulders just as the suv crashes on top of him, then tumbles toward his hunters, who scatter. cris makes a run for it just as the suv explodes in a fireball.}
<B>__{stakeout site}
<A>__{ferris and baines watch the events below.}
<D>__{ferris keep after him! quick! stay on him!}
<A>__{while they are distracted, liz climbs into the front seat of rick's police cruiser, cranks it up, slams into reverse, spins, and takes off down the road.}
<D>__{baines what the...?}
<B>__{liz}
<A>__{fishtails down the twisting mountain road.}
<B>__{maxwell gorge}
<A>__{cris practically mud skis down the slope. troopers and mp's hurtle after him. at the bottom, cris is carried by momentum onto the creekside}
<B>__{road...}
<A>__{into the path of a police car that comes careening around a curve! liz at the wheel. she swerves and slams on the brakes, skidding and screeching to a halt. troopers and mp's slalom onto the road from the incline and rush after cris. cris makes it to the car. driver's side.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{believe me now?}
<A>__{he climbs in and guns it.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i'm getting used to miracles.}
<A>__{three mp's grab onto the car's mirrors and door handles. cris weaves violently until they lose their grip and fly off. in rick's police cruiser dawn liz and cris grin at each other.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{where were you going?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{no idea. i was just trying to be unpredictable.}
<A>__{stakeout site dawn ferris urgently unrolls a road map and studies it. in rick's police cruiser dawn cris speeds down the treacherous curves.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{so what's the plan? bonnie and clyde? cris remember that place in the south pacific?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{it's starting to sound really good.}
