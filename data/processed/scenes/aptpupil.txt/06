<D>__{it... grabbed me. it was just like miss harmon said. i couldn't believe it. but there it was, the camps, the uniforms, the ...the way they saluted each other. but what am i telling you for? you know more about this stuff than anybody.}

<D>__{then last year i wrote my big term paper on dachau. i got an a+. it was the only a+ she gave. i mean i always do real well. a's on everything. that's why i'm accelerated.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{accelerated?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you know, accelerated. i skipped two grades, second and ninth. i didn't need them. that's why i'm already a junior.}
