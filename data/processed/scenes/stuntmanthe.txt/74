<A>__{there, beside the rear entrance on a pile of construction sand, sits eli, cross legged, staring morosely at some kids who play nearby. he is absently folding a torn script page into a paper airplane. behind him, at a respectful distance, stand the production manager, a.d., half a dozen assorted crew chiefs and sam baum, all looking concerned. sam looks at the others, shrugs and approaches eli, squatting beside him on the sand pile.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what do you wanna do, eli?... they're all waiting.}
<A>__{while sam talks, eli takes a fistful of sand and pours it in sam's shoe. suddenly noticing, sam yanks his foot away.}
<C>__{sam }
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{being childish isn't going to help your movie...you know, there's nothing wrong with the story.}
<P>__{(removing his shoe and shaking the sand out)}
<D>__{the real problem is since i wrote this thing two years ago, you've had watergate, the energy crisis, women's lib, the economy is down the tubes...you want to talk about burning issues?...there's arsenic in the glue on the back of food stamps! that's why you don't like the "madhouse scene." your goddamn war story has lost its relevance.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{don't be negative, sam. we can start a new one in time for the preview.}
<A>__{sam has finished replacing his shoe and eli pours a fistful of sand into sam's other shoe.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{cut it out, will ya?}
