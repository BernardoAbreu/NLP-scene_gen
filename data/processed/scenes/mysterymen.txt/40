<L>__{exterior shoveler's backyard a moment later}
<A>__{our heroes sit around the patio, dejected, miserable.}
<C>__{bowler }
<D>__{who died?}
<A>__{they look up, see her standing there, and aren't quite sure what to make of her.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{i'm the bowler.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{the bowler? i remember him from when i was a kid. he was killed years ago.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{i'm his daughter.}
<A>__{our heroes share a look.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{she takes her bowling ball and spins it on the tip of her finger (like a harlem globetrotter). for a long moment she just looks at them, smiling. on the others watching, almost mesmerized by the spinning ball... suddenly, she gives an ear splitting battle cry and starts swinging the ball around her in wide ferocious arcs, like a cannibal with a war club or a twirler on meth, going so fast she almost becomes a blur... then, just as suddenly, she stops, aims and rolls her ball... it shoots straight through invisible boy's legs... on a neatly placed collection of plaster lawn dwarves as the ball smashes into then, pulverizing them... it goes into a reverse spin, passes through invisible boy's legs again, and returns to the bowler who is holding its bag open for it... the ball rolls in.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{good ball.}
<A>__{on our heroes, left absolutely speechless.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{if it could zip up its own bag, then you'd be impressed, right?}
<A>__{she turns and walks out. our heroes share an amazed look, then run after her... just outside the gate on the bowler walking away... as furious catches up with her.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{hey... can i buy you a beer?}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{i thought you'd never ask.}
<A>__{she takes his arm and they all start to walk back into the shoveler's backyard... but the camera pans across the street to the dark place between two houses, where a man wearing a strange steel mask with a frightening, impassively powerful expression stands in the deep shadows, watching them in motionless, predatory silence. we do not know who he is, and we cannot tell if he is good or evil. back at the barbecue a little later close on a faded old snapshot of the original "the bowler" holding a little girl in his arms.}
<C>__{bowler }
<D>__{he was more than just a superhero... he was my father...}
<A>__{the others, touched by this, have gathered around the bowler, who is holding the old snapshot in her hand.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{and then one day, he didn't come home. the police said it was an accident. but cargo containers don't just fall on people. he was murdered... after that i fell apart. i dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. when my mother died i hit bottom... but then, when i was cleaning out her attic, i found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and i knew what i had to do.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{so who killed him?}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{the disco boys.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{you know something? those guys are really starting to piss me off!}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{but there's still only six of us.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{that's two more than the fantastic four.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{half a dirty dozen!}
<C>__{spleen}
<D>__{twice the three stooges!}
<C>__{invisible boy}
<D>__{and only one short of the magnificent seven.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{and you can't count horst buckholtz anyway.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{he was cute though.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{but they all had one thing we haven't got.}
<C>__{spleen}
<D>__{girlfriends?}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{a name. all the great superhero teams have got a fabulous name.}
<A>__{they all think about it for a moment. you can almost smell their brains overheating.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{how about... the savage six?}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{the inscrutable six?}
<C>__{spleen}
<D>__{the six pistols?}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{the exterminators!}
<C>__{invisible boy}
<D>__{the obliterators!}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{the eradicators!}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{the emasculators!}
<C>__{spleen}
<D>__{wait i got it!... the spleen team.}
<A>__{he gets beaned by a couple of empty soda cans.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{to hell with a name. let's get to work.}
<A>__{music up as furious stands and starts out. the others stand and follow him... as our heroes form up for their first heroic group shot.}
