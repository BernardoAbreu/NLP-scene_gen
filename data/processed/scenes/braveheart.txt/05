<L>__{exterior the macandrews farm day}
<A>__{the horses are all gone; the place looks deserted. up on the hill we see the three wallaces, looking down.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{stay here.}
<A>__{he means william. he and his elder son spur their horses. at the barn day the wallaces ride up, looking around.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{macandrews!... macandrews!?}
<A>__{malcolm finds a pitchfork, john the woodpile axe...}
<L>__{interior the barn}
<A>__{pov from within as the door opens and a widening block of sunlight illuminates the dusty shadows. malcolm and john wallace step in, and are shocked to see...}
<B>__{pov the wallaces}
<A>__{hanging from the rafters of the barn are thirty scottish noblemen and thirty pages, their faces purple and contorted by the strangulation hanging, their tongues protruding. malcolm stabs the pitchfork into the ground in useless anger; john still grips the axe as he follows his father through the hanging bodies of the noblemen to the back row, to see the one man in commoner's dress, like theirs...}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{macandrews.}
<A>__{a shuffle; john spins; william has entered the back door.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{william! get out of here!}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{why would macandrews make so many scarecrows?}
<A>__{before his father and brother can think of anything to say, william, with a boy's curiosity, touches the spurred foot of the hanged noblemen we first saw riding in. it's too solid; he takes a real look at the face, and suddenly }
<C>__{william}
<D>__{r real!!!... ahhhhhgggg!...}
<A>__{he turns to run, but knocks back into the feet of the hanged man behind him! in blind panic he darts in another direction, and runs into another corpse, and another; the hanged men begin to swing, making it harder for william's father and older brother to fight their way to him.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{william! william!}
<A>__{then, worst of all, william sees the pages, boys like himself, hanged in a row behind their masters! finally his father and brother reach william and hug him tight. there in the barn, among the swinging bodies of the hanged nobles, malcolm wallace grips his sons.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{murderin' english bastards.}
