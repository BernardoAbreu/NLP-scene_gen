<A>__{luke smiles and nods at the young man sitting next to carl.}
<B>__{bob leffert}
<A>__{is a good looking fellow, a few years older than carl. his face is pale and downcast, and he wears a cap pulled down on his forehead. he looks up at luke with hollow eyes. brings his right hand up, pushes the brim of his cap up. except there's no hand there it's a hook.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(quietly)}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{if it's tough, that means it's worth doing.}

<D>__{uh, back here, mr. mayor.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{well, come on out here so's we can see you.}
<A>__{spencer wyatt steps around from the back of the crowd near the door. he's a tall, dark haired, gangly, bespectacled kid, no more than 19 or 20. painfully shy, he clutches a clarinet case to his chest. he timidly smiles and waves at luke, who smiles and nods back.}

<B>__{adele}
<A>__{she locks eyes with luke. her hand goes to her mouth and her eyes well up. slowly, she moves around the counter, the crowd moving aside for her. she stands in front of luke, who has stood up to meet her. her eyes moist, she looks up at him.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{do you... remember me?}
<C>__{luke}
