<A>__{samuel, at the top of the barnyard, stops at the sound of the shot, wide eyed. he listens for an instant, starts a step toward the barn, then stops again, looks to a large bell suspended in a cupola by one of the outbuildings. he moves quickly to the bell, seizes the rope, pulls. the bell clangs loudly, sonorously.}
