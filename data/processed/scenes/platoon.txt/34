<A>__{chris is driven up in a jeep to his company pc marked 'bravo pc' on a c ration box. it's midday on a hot lazy afternoon, few people out in the 102 degree sun. chris' company is on the outskirts of the base camp, their barracks regulation wood, canvas, and fine mesh screening, red dust everywhere, bunkers down on the perimeter, reams of barbed wire and concertina, a sand bagged mess hall and chapel, 81 mm mortar pits, observation towers, recoiless rifles, 50 caliber machine guns. chris gets out of the jeep, stiff necked, a bandage around it, still in some pain. the first man he intersects is king, carrying crates of beer.}
