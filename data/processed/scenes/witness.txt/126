<P>__{(and)}
<D>__{be seeing you.}
<A>__{book hangs up the phone and the dead click registers on schaeffer. book has gripped the phone so tightly that it takes a second to unclench his fist. then it takes something else to resist his first impulse, which is to smash out at something... training. get it under control. deal rationally with the situation. he straightens his jacket, wipes the sweat tears from his eyes, turns and walks stiffly out of the saltzburg general store.}
