<L>__{interior hallway, junior high school day}
<A>__{will walks down the empty hallway. he glances back over his shoulder, where chet walks several feet behind him.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{yes, i'm still here. i really am this stupid. just pay attention to where you're going.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i think i can handle it.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{these floors get waxed once a week. on tuesday, which today is. you hit a slick patch, trip and fall, and i got a classroom full of kids wearing their skin inside out.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{chet, i'm fucking nervous enough as it is. please. i don't need you back seat driving me right now.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{obviously.}
<A>__{will stops, turns back toward chet.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{just for the record, this isn't a nuclear weapon strapped to my chest. and there are metal lockers on either side of the hallway. if i fall, and if this thing goes off, i'm probably not taking out the whole school.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{do you really want to debate this?}
<A>__{will sighs, turns back around. a second later, the school bell rings and kids flood the hallway, changing classes. will freezes. multiple kids shove past him. chet sweats bullets, gives will a look of death. after a beat, the hallway empties again.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{you're an asshole.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{whatever. it's over.}
<A>__{will continues walking. he tries to lighten the mood }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{who was the chick in the white jeans?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{kristi evans. why?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you know why.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{oh, come on. just keep walking.}
<A>__{the guys' voices fade as they continue down the hallway...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{come on yourself. you knew exactly who i was talking about.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{fuck you. she's in the eighth grade.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i bet you love it when she calls you mr. chet.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{she doesn't call me "mr. chet." she's not a foreigner.}
