<L>__{exterior ali's compound, n'sele ali pre dawn}
<A>__{rain stopped. the cold, blue light is illuminated with magenta at its base as dawn starts to rise over the congo river. wide: ali in a pale green shirt and slacks, walks towards the water, followed by zairians, teenagers, some kids who snuck into the compound, two older men. no media; no elite; no hype. one policeman who staggers, drunk. ali doesn't so much as walk to a destination as amble. he rubs the head of a 12 year old boy who starts shadowboxing five feet in front of him.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{you think you got a chance, chump? now you in trouble.}
<A>__{ali begins to spar with the 12 year old, who is fast and knows a little bit about boxing.}
<C>__{ali }
<D>__{you even dream of beating me? you better wake up and apologize!}
<A>__{kid throws a punch. ali collapses to his knees.}
<C>__{ali }
<D>__{he too much for me!}
<A>__{some laughter. then ali stands and puts his hand on the boy's shoulder. he ambles with the group towards the river. the sun's coming up on the other side.}
