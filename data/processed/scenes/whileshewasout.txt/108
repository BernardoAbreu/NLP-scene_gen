<L>__{exterior embankment evening}
<A>__{she creeps up the muddy embankment hiding deep in the shadows of some wiry shrubs, as close to the mud as her back will allow. the boys stop by the rocks. chuckie sweeps the flashlight up the muddy embankment, looking for a footprint, a sign of her. she tries to creep through the midst of the brush to avoid leaving prints. tries to stay quiet as a mouse. stops when she sees the flashlight sweep by. if she can get to the top, she can make another run for it. all of a sudden, it grows dark. the boys must have switched the flashlight off or maybe the battery's dead. she listens hard for their footfalls. nothing.}
