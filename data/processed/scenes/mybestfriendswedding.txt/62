<L>__{interior great room late night}
<A>__{bedlam. julianne caught in the middle of the throng. a young couple, dressed for travel, appear at the top of the staircase. the shout are deafening. the bride has her bouquet... ... she spots julianne far below. throws it her way, julianne reflexively goes for it... ... not a fucking chance. the twins nearly trample her in the stampede, mandy wresting the prize from sammy's grasp. everyone cheers, and then the couple is... ... flying down the stairs, racing through the crowd with a protective phalanx of groomsmen bodyguards, heading for the door, for freedom... ... julianne, trapped in the crush, loses sight of the couple, struggles against the flow, suddenly panicked by the certainty that she will never see him before... and then, he's there. he has julianne in his arms. holding her so tight. an embrace so wonderful, so terrible, she could go mad from the confusion alone. against the din, he murmurs in her ear...}
