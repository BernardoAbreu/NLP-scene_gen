<A>__{the guys pack their bags into vick's beat up caddy. the mood is as dark as the pre dawn sky. when the car is loaded, chastity takes alan's hands, gentle.}
<C>__{chastity}
<D>__{would you like me to come with?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{no...it might get a little dangerous. i wouldn't want...}
<A>__{he trails off. chastity nods.}
<C>__{chastity}
<D>__{i'm so sorry...about everything.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{thanks for all your help.}
<A>__{awkward silence. the cold desert wind blows.}
<C>__{chastity}
<D>__{there's no sense...in exchanging numbers or anything...right?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{yeah, probably not...}
<A>__{alan looks genuinely sad.}
<C>__{chastity}
<D>__{well...i will always remember you as a great first husband, then.}
<A>__{they both smile weakly.}
<C>__{chastity }
<D>__{you can just send the divorce papers to the crazy horse or whatever...}
<A>__{alan nods, okay. another awkward pause.}
<C>__{chastity }
<D>__{thanks for reminding me that there are still some really good guys out there, alan. i don't...i don't get to meet too many of them.}
<A>__{she smiles a bit sadly, kisses him on the cheek, and walks off. tight on alan's grandmother's ring still on her finger. alan doesn't remember the ring, however; he's too busy watching her walk out of his life, and feeling a real sense of loss... then vick fires up the car next to him.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{we gotta go, man.}
<A>__{alan nods, yeah, and gets in the car...}
