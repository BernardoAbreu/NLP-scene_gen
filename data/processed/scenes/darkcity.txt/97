<L>__{exterior library night}
<A>__{the puppet wheels up to the sweeping set of stairs at the base of the building. it stops, wheels bump into the steps repeatedly. it looks down and shrieks with a string of mechanical obscenities.}
<L>__{interior mystery men's underworld}
<A>__{white and bumstead follow schreber down a corridor to what appears to be an ancient crypt. they enter a door it has something written on it in a strange language.}
<B>__{inside is a room}
<A>__{they stumble around in the darkness, schreber finds a light switch, suddenly white stops dead in his tracks bumstead turns to him.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{look.}
<A>__{white points to a wall featuring a line of brass hooks. on these hooks hang mystery men coats that's not all. each hook carries a face. bumstead and white step closer, look at the faces. they seem to be elaborate, very life like masks.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{put them on.}
<A>__{white and the inspector look at each other, incredulous. outside the corridor the door opens. white, bumstead and schreber step out, wearing poorly fitting masks and coats disguised as mystery men.}
<B>__{further along the corridor}
<A>__{the three men come across a small area with a raised platform, between arches. a number of open carts roll past on tracks the scene resembles some bizarre amusement park ride. the carts are numbered on the side all of them empty.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{get in. hurry.}
<A>__{white, bumstead and schreber hop aboard. the cart takes them into a dark tunnel, deeper into the secret underworld of the mystery men. they move through a subterranean landscape of unexplained contraptions and bones.}
<C>__{white}
<P>__{(to bumstead)}
<D>__{where do you think this goes?}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{it sure isn't the fun fair.}
<A>__{the cart finally comes to a stop in a cave. bumstead, white and schreber leap out and hide in a dark doorway, as a long line of mystery men walk past them.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{follow me, and do exactly as i do.}
<A>__{they join the end of the line, falling into step.}
