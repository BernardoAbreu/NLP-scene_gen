<L>__{interior second floor landing and stairs night}
<A>__{karen and birdie come down the stairs to bill, max, addison, a blonde young lady named miss caswell (addison's protegee of the moment) and, at the feet of bill and addison... eve. they are all seated on the steps. birdie goes through and down the stairs to the first floor. karen remains with the others. addison is holding forth:}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{every now and then, some elder statesman of the theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.}
<C>__{miss caswell}
<P>__{(as birdie and the sables pass)}
<D>__{now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.}
<C>__{bill's voice}
<D>__{and probably has.}
<C>__{miss caswell}
<D>__{sable.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(to miss caswell)}
<D>__{did you say sable or gable?}
<C>__{miss caswell}
<D>__{either one.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{it is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in new york, hollywood and london are no different from the good people of des moines, chillicothe and liverpool. by and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children }
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{gable. why a feller like that don't come east to do a play...}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{he must be miserable, the life he lives out there }
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{these so called abnormalities they're our stock in trade, they make us actors, writers, directors, et cetera in the first place }
<C>__{max}
<D>__{answer me this. what makes a man become a producer?}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{what makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{this answer satisfies me a hundred percent.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{we all have abnormality in common. we are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we theater folk. we are the original displaced personalities...}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(laughs; to eve)}
<D>__{you don't have to read his column tomorrow you just heard it. i don't agree, addison...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{that happens to be your particular abnormality.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{oh, i admit there's a screwball element in the theater. it sticks out, it's got spotlights on it and a brass band. but it isn't basic, it isn't standard if it were, the theater couldn't survive...}
<C>__{miss caswell}
<P>__{(to a passing butler)}
<D>__{oh, waiter...}
<A>__{the butler goes right by.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{that isn't a waiter, my dear. that's a butler.}
<C>__{miss caswell}
<D>__{well, i can't yell "oh, butler," can i? maybe somebody's name is butler...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{you have a pointerior an idiotic one, but a pointerior}
<C>__{miss caswell}
<D>__{i don't want to make trouble. all i want is a drink.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{leave me get you one...}
<C>__{miss caswell}
<P>__{(pitching)}
<D>__{oh, thank you, mr. fabian.}
<A>__{max leaves with her empty glass.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{well done. i see your career rising in the east like the sun...}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{... you were saying?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i was saying that the theater is nine tenths hard work. work done the hard way by sweat, application and craftsmanship. i will agree to this that to be a good actor, actress, or anything else in the theater, means wanting to be that more than anything else in the world...}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{yes. yes, it does.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(goes on)}
<D>__{it means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... and i will agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be just someone. to give so much for almost always so little...}
<A>__{eve speaks almost unaware of what she says. she looks at no one in particular, just off...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{so little. so little, did you say? why, if there's nothing else there's applause. it's like like waves of love coming over the footlights and wrapping you up. imagine... to know, every night, that different hundreds of people love you... they smile, their eyes shine you've pleased them, they want you, you belong. just that alone is worth anything...}
<A>__{she becomes aware of addison's strange smile, of bill's looks of warm interest. she's embarrassed, she turns away then scrambles to her feet as margo approaches with lloyd from the direction of the pantry. margo's had too much to drink. her fake smile fades as eve gets up. she's unpleasant and depressed.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{don't get up. and please stop acting as if i were the queen mother.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i didn't mean to }
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{outside of a beehive, margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? we're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night }
<P>__{(to eve)}
<D>__{ aren't we, honey?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{margo, really...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{please don't play governess, karen, i haven't your unyielding good taste, i wish i'd gone to radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it he needed help at the notions counter...}
<P>__{(to addison)}
<D>__{i'm being rude now, aren't i? or should i say "ain't i"?}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{you're maudlin and full of self pity. you're magnificent.}
<A>__{max has come up with miss caswell's drink.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{how about calling it a night?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{and you pose as a playwright. a situation pregnant with possibilities and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it's a good thought.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it won't play.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{as a nonprofessional, i think it's an excellent idea. undramatic, but practical...}
<A>__{as she speaks, she makes her way to lloyd's side.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{happy little housewife...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{cut it out.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{this is my house, not a theater! in my house you're a guest, not a director !}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{then stop being a star start treating your guests as your supporting cast!}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{hear, hear...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{now let's not get into a big hassle }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it's about time we did! it's about time margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{all right! i'm going to bed.}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{you be the host. it's your party. happy birthday, welcome home, and we who are about to die salute you.}
<A>__{she starts upstairs.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{need any help?}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(pauses, smiles)}
<D>__{to put me to bed? take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. wouldn't you, eve?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{if you'd like.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i wouldn't like.}
<A>__{she goes up, exits out of sight. a pause. miss caswell reaches up to take the drink out of max's hand.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i forgot i had it.}
<C>__{miss caswell}
<D>__{i didn't.}
<A>__{bill gets up and goes after margo...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{too bad! we'll miss the third act. they're going to play it off stage.}
<A>__{eve turns away abruptly, in sudden tears.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{coming?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{in a minute...}
<A>__{she crosses to eve, puts an arm around her.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you mustn't mind margo too much, even if i do...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{but there must be some reason, something i've done without knowing...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{the reason is margo and don't try to figure it out. einstein couldn't.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{if i thought i'd offended her, of all people }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{eve. i'm fond of margo too. but i know margo. and every now and then there is nothing i want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{well if she's got to pick on someone, i'd just as soon it was me.}
<A>__{karen smiles back. she joins lloyd and max.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{max is going to drop us...}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{i've often wondered, max, why you bother with a chauffeur and limousine in new york city.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{in my case it's necessary. too many taxi drivers write plays.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{and too many of them are produced.}
<C>__{miss caswell}
<D>__{let's go sit by the piano.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{you have me confused with dan dailey. you go sit by the piano.}
<P>__{(to eve)}
<D>__{and you come sit by me.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{they laugh, say "good night," and start downstairs. as eve crosses to addison:}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{karen...}
<P>__{(karen pauses)}
<D>__{... you won't forget, will you? what we talked about before?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{no, eve, i won't forget...}
<A>__{she follows the men downstairs. close up of an old engraving of mrs. siddons as 'the tragic muse' which hangs among other theatrical mementos on the stair wall...}
