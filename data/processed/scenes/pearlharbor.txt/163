<L>__{exterior haleiwa auxiliary airfield day}
<A>__{haleiwa is a tiny airfield, tucked among the green volcanic hills; its barely paved, and it's only permanent building is a quonset hut. a mechanic named earl, is out with the p 40's; and these are spread out, not bunched. earl and the p 40's the planes here have received loving care from earl which means lots of cursing; as he's wrestling to load an ammo belt, he yells.}

<D>__{sum bitch!}
<A>__{the buick, bullet holes punched through the truck, slides to a stop near the planes, and the pilots jump out.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{they ready, earl?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{they'll all fly, but oh, shit...}
<A>__{what stops him is the cloud of zeros and dive bombers, shrieking in.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{cover!}
<A>__{the guys scatter. there are sandbags around the hut, and they run there, diving into it's shelter just before the first strafing pass, when a zero strafes one of the p 40's and a dive bomber blasts another. earl stands up in shock and fury.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you absolute mother fuckin' son of a bitch! you shot one of my planes!}
<A>__{danny pulls him down, as the zeros roar overhead.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{this ain't a little feud, earl, it's world war two!}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{they're coming around for another pass. you got extra weapons and ammo?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{cock suckin' right i do!! in the gun lockers!}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you guys get those! earl, rafe, come with me!}
<A>__{danny, rafe and earl run to the planes that got hit and strip out the 20mm cannons and ammo.}
