The JAPANESE SCIENCE OFFICERS go over charts on the electronic position board, a contiuously-shifting graphic representation of the ocean contours below. Behind them is an elaborate DEPTH GAUGE with computerized graphics. READ: 34,000 feet and dropping. The Crew works at a fevered pitch. An ALARM SOUNDS as the depth gauge sounds 35,000 feet. All eyes on the depth gauge. Several Science Officers share excited looks. ON THE DEPTH GAUGE: 35,100 -- 35,200 -- 35,300 -- 35,400... The excitement builds. Even the Captain's weathered eyes widen. And then, as the depth gauge hits 35,801 feet below sea level, the entire Crew breaks into CHEERS, WHOOPS, HANDSHAKES AND HIGH-FIVES.}

Down here, ten thousand fathoms below the storm, all is calm. The dual TURBO-PROPS on the ear of the submersible KICK ON. The Bathysaphe is now mobile.

Then, dead ahead, is the end of the trough, which is half-blocked by a rock-encrusted embankment. The MUSIC builds. The Shinkai approaches the embankment. Slowly starts to glide up the side. The Captain and Science Officers seem mesmerized by all the lonely creepiness. They crest the embankment. And the plexi-domed VIEW FILLS with an unimaginable horror. As far as the eye can see, the entire murky landscape is filled with WHALE BONES. A valley of death. Cluttered here and there, carelessly flung about, are the rusting hulks of several ships. Seemingly ripped apart. Clusters of shark cartilage float through the water like white ghosts. The Captain, the Science Officers and the entire Crew just stare, frozen in place by the strange horror before them.}

The Science Officers look stunned. The Captain barks commands. The Crew leaps into high gear. Then the Captain reverses the trottle, and petal-to-the-metal he starts to back out. The inky blood swirls past the plexi-dome. Then suddenly, and impossibly, the SUBMERSIBLE JERKS TO A HALT. Everybody goes ass-over-teacups. EQUIPMENT SHATTERS. SPARKS FLY. GLASS BREAKS. Lots of YELLING in Japanese. The SHINKAI starts to ROCK and SHAKE. Something has a hold on it. More EQUIPMENT SHATTERS. Men are thrown about. Then it stops rocking. The Sailors stop yelling. Everything goes dead quiet. Frightened eyes share terror-filled looks. A SOUND is HEARD coming from the exterior of the ship, like feet runing across the outside of the hull. Very creepy. The HULL starts to MOAN and CREAK from an UNSEEN PRESSURE. And then the sub begins to be crushed like it's a beer can. The metal HULL TORQUES on all sides. RIVETS POP and SNAP. WATER SPRAYS and SHOOTS. More SPARKS FLY. The STEEL PLATING DIMPLES, CRUMBLES and SCREAMS in agony. CHAOS. PANDEMONIUM. And then the SHINKAI IMPLODES.
