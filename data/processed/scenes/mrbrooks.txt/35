<D>__{ask your daughter what the real reason is she dropped out of school.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i keep telling you it's not the reason.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{you wanted to go to college, you had good grades in high school, your father helped you get into stanford, we're paying a ton of money, if this is not the reason, then please dear god tell me the reason.}

<D>__{why does your mother think you dropped out of school?}
<C>__{jane}

<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(to his daughter)}
<D>__{you're right. i'm sorry. i said it wrong. i'm not trying to tell you what to do. i'm trying to say that a grandchild would be a wonderful gift for your mother and me.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{please, honey, don't have an abortion.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{would you really want to have a grandchild, even though i'm not married?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{yes. the child is what's important. we would love it and cherish it completely and help you raise it.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{if it means that much to you, i will think about it.}
