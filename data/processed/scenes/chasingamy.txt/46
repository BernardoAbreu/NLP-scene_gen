<A>__{alyssa marches quickly, pulling on her coat. holden catches up to her. we track with them our into the parking lot.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{so it's true?!}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{yes holden! in fact, everything you heard or dug up on me was probably true! yeah, i took on two guys at once! you want to hear some gems you might not have unearthed i took a twenty six year old guy to my senior prom, and then left halfway through to have sex with him and gwen turner in the back of a limo! and the girl who got caught in the shower with miss moffit, the gym teacher? that was me! or how about in college, when i let shannon hamilton videotape us having sex only to find out the next day that he broadcast it on the campus cable station?! they're all true those and so many more! didn't you know? i'm the queen of urban legend!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{how the hell could you do those things?!}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{easily! some of it i did out of stupidity, some of it i did out of what i thought was love, but good or bad they were my choices, and i'm not making apologies for them now not to you or anyone! and how dare you try to lay a guilt trip on me about it in public, no less! who the fuck do you think you are, you judgemental prick?!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{how am i supposed to feel about all of this?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{how are you supposed to feel about it? feel what ever the fuck you want about it! the only thing that really matters is how you feel about me.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i don't know how i feel about you now.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{why? because i had some sex?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{some sex?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{yes, holden that's all it was: some sex! most of it stupid high school sex, for christ's sake! like you never had sex in high school!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{there's a world of fucking difference between typical high school sex and two guys at once! they fucking used you?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i used them! you don't think i would've let it happen if i hadn't wanted it to, do you?! i was an experimental girl, for christ's sake! maybe you knew early on that your track was from point 'a' to 'b' but unlike you i wasn't given a fucking map at birth, so i tried it all! that is until we that's you and i got together, and suddenly, i was sated. can't you take some fucking comfort in that? you turned out to be all i was ever looking for the missing piece in the big fucking puzzle!}
<P>__{(tries to calm down)}
<D>__{look i'm sorry i let you believe that you were the only guy i'd ever been with. i should've been more honest. but it seemed to make you feel special in a way that me telling you over and over again how incredible you are would never get across.}
<A>__{she touches his face. he pulls back. she stares at him, hurt and pissed.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{do you mean to tell me that while you have zero problem with me sleeping with half the women in new york city you have some sort of half assed, mealy mouthed objection to pubescent antics, that took place almost ten years ago? what the fuck is your problem?!?}
<A>__{holden's eyes are downcast. alyssa waits for a response.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i want us to be something that we can't.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{and what's that?}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a normal couple.}
<A>__{holden skulks off. alyssa stares after him, and then starts kicking and punching a car beside her, finally slumping to the ground. she cries.}
