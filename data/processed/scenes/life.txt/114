<L>__{exterior dillard's house day}
<A>__{breathless, claude makes it to the kitchen window and digs his hand into the golden brown crust, shoving a sloppy fistful of pie into his mouth. more shots ring out. bullets ping all around him. grabbing the pie, he darts around the side of the building, out of range. back against the wall, he drops down on his haunches, snarfing pie like a hungry wolf.}
<L>__{exterior camp 8 yard day}
<A>__{a case of empty coke bottles sits in the middle of the yard, glinting in the hot sun. his face smeared with boysenberry, claude finishes taking off his boots and socks and steps barefoot onto the bottles.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{comfortable?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{as a pair of fur lined bedroom slippers, boss.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{we'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. and if you step down off them bottles if one toe so much as touches the dirt one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. let's see. we need a special man for this job.}
<A>__{he takes a trusty's rifle and moves among the inmates, who have gathered around. he stops when he gets to ray.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{how about it, ray?}
<A>__{ray glances at claude, then back at dillard.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{i will make you trusty right now. if that pie eatin' son of a bitch falls off those bottles and you have to shoot him, i will see to it you get a pardon. hell, i will personally escort you out the gate.}
<A>__{dillard offers the rifle to ray, who doesn't have to think too long.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you don't want to give me a gun, boss. i'm liable to use it on you.}
