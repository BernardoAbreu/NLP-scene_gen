<L>__{exterior crash ship day}
<A>__{johns stands atop the crash ship, scanning with a scope. he fixates on... a blue glow on the horizon. "what the hell is it?" zeke and shazza modify breather units, adding straps and tubing and ball floats. the prototype is tested on audrey. she sucks on the mouthpiece and finds that it works, supplying oxygen on demand rather than in a constant flow. chrislams convert to traditional bedouin head gear, readying for travel. fry finishes wrapping owens' body. she looks to the yellow sun, low on the horizon. the red sun seems inclined to follow.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{imam. we should leave soon. before nightfall but while it's cooler.}
<C>__{zeke}
<D>__{what, you're goin' off, too?}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{johns is leaving you a gun. just do me a favor, huh? get my crewies buried? they were good guys who died bad.}
<C>__{shazza}
<D>__{a'course we will.}
<P>__{pilgrim #1 (o.s.)}
<D>__{imam...imam....}
<A>__{(note: "imam" is pronounced "el ee mam.") fry and the others round the ship to see... a blue star flaring into view . it's rising as the other suns are setting.}
<C>__{shazza}
<D>__{my bloody oath....}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{three suns?}
<C>__{zeke}
<P>__{(to fry)}
<D>__{so much for your nightfall.}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{so much for my cocktail hour.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{we take this to be a good sign a path, a direction from god.}
<A>__{johns swings down from the top of the ship.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{a very good sign.}
<P>__{(re: blue sun)}
<D>__{that's riddick's direction. you do not wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{thought you found his restraints over there. toward sunset.}
<C>__{johns}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{which means he went toward sunrise.}
