<D>__{all right, put your left hand on the edge of the table and you can explore with your right. i will be right here beside you.}
<A>__{we see reba start to reach out. then we see what she is about to touch. ten foot long bengal tiger reba's hand feels the fur slide across her palm. reba's hand the fur springs between her fingers. tiger's great paw reba's hand enters down its foreleg. warfield with two hands lifts the great paw and puts it in her hand. reba's hand feels the roughness of the pads. she presses and the claw slides cut. both her hands go up his leg to the heavy supple muscles of his shoulder. tiger's head reba's hand gently touches the tiger's ears and both hands feel the width of his head. tiger's mouth the hot breath coming across its rough tongue stirs the hairs on her forearms. tiger's chest reba's arms wrap around the huge chest. slowly her face lowers and she puts her ear next to the tiger's ribs. reba's ecstatic. we hear what she hears: the heartbeat. it fills us and reba with its bright thunder.}
