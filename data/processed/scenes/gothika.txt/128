<L>__{exterior newcastle community bank parking lot day}
<A>__{a tense phil and dorothy parsons in their parked car.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{i'm not doing it for miranda, i'm doing this for rachel.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{you're making a complete fool of yourself. do you realize what you sound like?}
<A>__{she sighs, climbs out of the car, leaving him there. takes three steps. stops. turns back around and lets him have it:}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{what do i sound like, phil? like one of your patients? well, it's probably because that's exactly how you treat me. and i've had enough of this deafening silence between us, this exemplary mourning in front of the community, tiptoeing around our lives with you pretending rachel never existed.}
<A>__{bank customers walk around the argument, pretending not to hear. phil is mortified. but dorothy doesn't care:}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{i'm losing my mind. our daughter is gone and i miss her and i'm angry.}
<A>__{she turns and storms off. phil takes it all in for the first time. a moment later he climbs out of the car.}
