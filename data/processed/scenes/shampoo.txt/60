<A>__{lester shakes his head as if to clear it. he takes a drink and almost on cue the acid rock music hits and the strobe lights go on. lester is momentarily alarmed, as if it had something to do with his drink. he manages to stagger out of the strobe light effect, hangs onto a railing in the next room.}

<A>__{he points toward the kitchen door where lester looks like he's about to enter. pope takes jill and they move out the back door in the direction of the rear grounds that jackie and george had taken earlier.}
<B>__{lester}
<A>__{peers into the kitchen. it's filled mostly with unkempt beards. he decides against it, turns up a small staircase and continues up it until he finds himself in a den. several people are seated on the floor, quietly smoking and watching television. they seem a shade better dressed than those in the kitchen. lester squints at the set which is a little blurry and partially blocked, by someone sitting directly in front of it. he kneels by a fortyish man in a bush jacket smoking a pipe.}
