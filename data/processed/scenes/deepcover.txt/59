<L>__{exterior same much later that night}
<A>__{the body has been taken away, the crowd has cleared. elias sits on the hood of the trans am. hull stands, staring down.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{it wasn't your fault.}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{what could you have done?}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{she worked for me. i'm supposed to protect her.}
<A>__{elias knows that's true, and it leads to another truth.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{we have to kill him.}
<A>__{hull looks up.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{or we lose all authority with the other dealers. and one of them'll kill you.}
<A>__{hull looks up, startled.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you've got to assert now, or you're dead.}
<A>__{hull sees the truth of that and slowly nods.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and if we kill ivy, we control this whole territory.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{that guy who works for barbosa can do it, chino.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{no. if we use chino, it's barbosa who's asserting. it'll be barbosa's territory.}
<P>__{(again: his hatred of barbosa)}
<D>__{it's gotta be us.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{and if it's us, it's gotta be you.}
<A>__{meaning he can't do it. hull knows that. a long beat on hull's face as he reaches the inevitable decision.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{don't blow your cover.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{if i do this, we're partners. equal partners on everything.}
<A>__{elias offers his hand. hull stands up, a sudden resolve.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{let's go.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(afraid)}
<D>__{now...?}
<A>__{but hull is already moving.}
