<A>__{behan comes out of nellie cashman's, spots josephine going down toughnut. he catches up to her, pacing her. she keeps walking.}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{listen, i want to talk to you.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{not now. i don't have time.}
<C>__{behan}
<P>__{(grabs her)}
<D>__{i saw that look pass between you and wyatt at the fight. listen to me! you're mine! understand? you're my woman and i'm your man.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{my man? you told wyatt you'd disarmed those men. do you actually believe after that i could see you as my man? you're just a dirty little fixer.}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{you whore! you filthy whore!}
<A>__{a hand reaches into frame, spinning behan around. morgan stands there, arm in a sling, red in his eye:}

<D>__{you don't talk that way to a female human being! not ever!}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{look, i don't want to take advantage of an injured man but you better }
<A>__{with his good arm morgan slugs behan in the mouth. behan drops like a leaf, as much to avoid a further injury as from the blow. morgan turns to josephine, leading her away. across the street curly bill and ringo share a flask, watching, ringo looking even odder than usual. curly bill chuckles:}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{so she's wyatt's slice now. looks like we got another name for the tally book.}
