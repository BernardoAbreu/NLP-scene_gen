<L>__{exterior hyperspace}
<A>__{the pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange surreal light show surrounds the ship.}

<C>__{han}
<D>__{stand by, chewie, here we go. cut in the sublight engines.}
<A>__{han pulls back on a control lever. outside the cockpit window stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then stop. suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently shake about. asteroids begin to race toward them, battering the sides of the ship.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{what the...? aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. some kind of asteroid collision. it's not on any of the charts.}
<A>__{the wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool in the emergency. luke makes his way into the bouncing cockpit.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{our position is correct, except... no, alderaan!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what do you mean? where is it?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{thats what i'm trying to tell you, kid. it ain't there. it's been totally blown away.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what? how?}
<A>__{ben moves into the cockpit behind luke as the ship begins to settle down.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{destroyed... by the empire!}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{the entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. it'd take a thousand ships with more fire power than i've...}
<A>__{a signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled alarm starts humming.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{there's another ship coming in.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{maybe they know what happened.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's an imperial fighter.}
<A>__{chewbacca barks his concern. a huge explosion bursts outside the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. a tiny, finned imperial tie fighter races past the cockpit window.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it followed us!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no. it's a short range fighter.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{there aren't any bases around here. where did it come from?}
