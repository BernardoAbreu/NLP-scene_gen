<L>__{361 group shot the three apes}
<A>__{cornelius tries again.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{a doll alone proves nothing. true. but the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{your conclusion is premature. have you forgotten your scripture? the thirteenth scroll?}
<P>__{(quoting from memory)}
<D>__{'and proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'}
<C>__{cornelius}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{no sir, i haven't forgotten.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{well? for a time the ancients kept humans as household pets. until the lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. keep digging cornelius. you'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.}
<A>__{a 361 another angle to include taylor and nova as zira again appeals to the man.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{are you going to let that pass without an answer?}
<A>__{taylor, who has been toying with objects in the dirt, looks up.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{yes. i have to agree. from all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{what are you doing there?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{reconstructing a life. care to have a look?}
<A>__{cornelius and zira cross the pit and zaius walks around the rim of the excavation. b 361 med. close shot favoring taylor and nova as the apes come close. a number of artifacts have been arranged in front of taylor.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(to cornelius)}
<D>__{these were found near the human doll, right?}
<P>__{(cornelius nods)}
<D>__{well, whoever owned them was in pretty bad shape.}
<A>__{he picks up the twisted fragment of a pair of spectacles.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{defective eyesight..}
<A>__{as taylor continues his monologue, he picks up the other objects one by one.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{he wore false teeth.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{he suffered from a hernia and used this truss to hold up his insides ...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{and toward the end, these little rings of stainless steel enclosed a prefab ricated valve in his failing heart.}
<A>__{taylor pauses. zaius picks up two of the steel rings, studies them.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i don't say he was a man like an earthman, but i'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.}
<P>__{(to zaius pointedly)}
<D>__{yet, fragile as he was, he came before you and was superior to you.}
<C>__{zaius}
<P>__{(a calm smile)}
<D>__{that's lunacy. i can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. but it would be conjecture, not proof.}
