<A>__{anna is not seeing or hearing, struggling against the doctor and the mid wife, while annushka holds her hand.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{thank god! she talks only of you.}
<A>__{in her delirium, anna keeps up a bright prattle.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{why doesn't he come? he is kind. he will forgive me.}
<C>__{midwife}
<D>__{he's here look look can't you see him?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i want alexei! why doesn't he come? give me some water. no, i mustn't, it's not good for my little girl. or let her have a nurse. yes don't bring her here, because alexei is coming and it will hurt him to see her.}
<C>__{annushka}

<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh, what nonsense. i must be asleep, that's what it is. you think he won't forgive me but you don't know him. no one knows him except me. i'm not afraid of him now.}
<A>__{karenin gazes at her. he looks at her as he's never looked at her.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{i'm afraid of death, though.}
<A>__{karenin tries to speak but cannot. he starts making shushing noises as to a baby. she quietens down. she seems to recognise him.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{oh, my dear. don't look at me like that. i am not the one you think. i'm afraid of her. she fell in love with another man. i'm the real one. but i'm dying now, then she'll be dead, too. poor man! let him come in. alexis! alexis!}
