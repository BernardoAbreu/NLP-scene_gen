<L>__{interior department store afternoon}
<A>__{chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department store... he checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a pack of cigarettes from his breast pocket time for a smoke break.}
<L>__{exterior intersection near department store afternoon}
<A>__{sam and corey meander toward the intersection where randy's car is stopped at a red light.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we just gotta figure out what we're gonna do. i don't think }
<C>__{corey}
<P>__{(abrupt)}
<D>__{lemme guess, you wanna go home.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{you wanna run back to mommy and daddy and say sorry so they can put you through college. well that's real big of you, sam, but i don't have that option.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{i will go home and get the shit kicked out of me, and get my ass grabbed by my mom's boyfriend...}
<A>__{they're almost to the light, which is still red, and coming up on randy's car. jeff, mike and ruth stare out at them from the backseat, smelling the drama.}
<C>__{corey }
<D>__{i knew you'd bail on me eventually, but not this quick.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm not bailing on you. would you just }
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{you can fucking sleepwalk back to middlesex for all i care. i'm not driving you... you're a fucking drag.}
<A>__{the light turns green, and randy's car peels across the intersection, making a left...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{fuck you, corey.}
<A>__{sam wheels on her and steps out into the street, storming straight across. corey starts to follow... but something stops her in her tracks: billy moorcroft. he stands on the opposite side of the intersection, in the trajectory that sam is walking but sam doesn't see him. billy wears a birthday hat, slacks and collared shirt. he looks pale and weak, and is covered with bruises. he stares right back at corey, as transfixed as she is... time slows down. [note: sam's position is in the middle of the road. randy's car has made the left but is still in the vicinity of the intersection.] bewildered, corey tries to step out into the street but something blocks her an invisible force field makes forward progress impossible. ripples swell like waves throughout the barrier where she hit it. she looks up, following the ripples with her eyes, and watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision, into infinite space. she reaches forth with her hand, wanting to feel the barrier once again... just as she touches it... real time resumes ka boom!}
<B>__{from out of nowhere an old jalopy sails right in front}
<A>__{randy's car! he jerks the wheel and the jalopy hits on the front passenger side completely smashing it in sam spins when she hears the deafening crunch... randy careens into the opposite lane, and an oncoming car smacks him dead on. the inertia from the oncoming vehicle plows his car into a fire hydrant by the side of the road. the hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and strikes sam right in the head! the world goes silent. chris runs toward the destruction, dropping his cigarette...}
<B>__{water erupts like a geyser from the pipe where the hydrant used to be...}
<A>__{sam's body is crumpled in the street, motionless...}
<B>__{billy moorcroft is gone. the force field is gone. corey}
<A>__{stands frozen, horrified... in utter shock.}
