<A>__{alex and nick creep over the roof, and sure enough, there's a skylight in the center, caked with grime. nick stands and plants his foot through the skylight. it shatters, raining down glass into the darkness below. nick pulls off his belt and hooks it around one of the iron sash bars. gripping the belt, he lowers himself down. after a moment, he disappears from view. alex leans over the skylight. she can't see a thing.}
