<L>__{interior police car}
<A>__{there are two plainclothes policemen inside, one at the wheel, the other in the back seat. the latter leans forward to ask the former:}
<D>__{1st policeman what's this deal tonight?}
<C>__{murph}
<P>__{(the 2nd policeman)}
<D>__{one of the lieutenant's "surprise parties", i think.}
<A>__{murph's tone shows obvious repugnance. the 1st policeman broods for a moment; he adds in a quiet, but viciously resentful manner:}
<D>__{1st policeman one of these days i'd like to turn in my badge and tangle with "popsie" myself he's no good.}
<B>__{resume kello and sidney}
<A>__{sidney, increasingly uncomfortable, turns to kello.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{can't you wait up the block? it's not going to look so good, right in front of the club...}
<A>__{to kello this is a great joke. he laughs, enjoying sidney's uneasiness. he begins to "cat and mouse" sidney.}
<C>__{kello}
<P>__{(heavily humorous)}
<D>__{it's nice, sidney, that you give me this tip...}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(interjecting)}
<D>__{ he's got them on him.}
<C>__{kello}
<P>__{(solemnly nodding his approval)}
<D>__{...and he's got them on him. i appreciate a thing like that i appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.}
<A>__{sidney, annoyed at this sarcasm, moves past kello, not deigning to respond. as he goes by, kello grasps him forcibly by the arm.}
<C>__{kello}
<D>__{what's your hurry, snooks?}
<A>__{camera has panned to shoot towards the car out of which emerges a second detective.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(revolted)}
<D>__{take your hands off, kello...}
<A>__{kello, holding sidney, turns towards the second detective in background.}
<C>__{kello}
<D>__{murph, how do you like this face? why, i will be darned it's melting! something got you scared, sidney...? listen, rectify me a certain thing. wasn't you kidding, snooks, when you told j.j. i was fat...?}
<A>__{sidney jerks his arm away, rapidly retreats a few yards, a safe distance from kello. camera pans with him to the bottom of the steps.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{sleep in peace, kello you're skinny but j.j. says you sweat!}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{sidney in foreground, kello and murph beyond. kello laughs; but obviously he would like to be nearer to sidney. perhaps to detain sidney, kello drawls:}
<C>__{kello}
<D>__{is that a fact? he's a dilly, ain't he? by the by, what did he have against this boy?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{he goes out with girls.}
<C>__{kello}
<D>__{well, i will be darned. and what does j.j. think he should do?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(impudently)}
<D>__{go out with different girls!}
<B>__{kello}
<A>__{he moves forward a little.}
<C>__{kello}
<P>__{(softly now)}
<D>__{i get the peculiar impression, snooks, that you don't like me. could i be wrong?}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{he turns swiftly and goes up the stairs out of kello's reach.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(as he goes)}
<D>__{you could be right, you fat slob?}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{from half way up the stairs. sidney comes up the steps two at a time. kello and murphy are seen beyond.}
<C>__{kello}
<P>__{(with a guffaw)}
<D>__{come back here, sidney...i wanna chastise you!...}
<B>__{from the bridge}
<A>__{sidney reaches the top. he comes along the pedestrian walk up to camera, slowing down he turns across the rail and looks down towards the square. camera moves to take in the scene in wide angle: sidney in foreground, the police car and detectives below, the entrance to robard's across the square. sidney waits. in the distance we can hear the music of dallas' last number coming to an end.}
