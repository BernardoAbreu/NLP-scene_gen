<L>__{interior record store later}
<A>__{dick is behind the counter, rob in the aisles with a clipboard doing inventory.}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(re: music)}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{the new belle and sebastian. like it?}
<A>__{the door flies open and barry, an acid tongued post punk rock misanthrope without quite enough intelligence to conceptualize his own rebellion, walks in. his teeth are clenched in air guitar concentration and he's phonetically cranking a clash riff:}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{baa! ba ba dang!}
<A>__{dick shrinks back from him instinctively. he stops mid step and cocks his ear at the music playing in the store. his face adopts an exaggerated grimace.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{holy shiite! what the fuck's this?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{it's the new }
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it's the record we've been listening to and enjoying, barry.}
<A>__{barry moves in on the stereo behind the counter, and dick gets out of his way.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{well that's problematic because it sucks ass.}
<A>__{he pops the cd out and frisbees it to dick.}
<C>__{barry}
<P>__{(re: the cd)}
<D>__{yours, i assume...}
<A>__{barry pulls a tape out of his jacket and jams it in. "how to kill a radio consultant" by public enemy comes through at through the red levels.}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(over the blare)}
<D>__{turn it off, barry.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{it won't go any louder.}
<A>__{barry walks in rhythm toward the stockroom and disappears. rob goes behind the counter and stops the tape. barry's head pops out of the stockroom.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i don't want to hear public enemy right now.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{public enemy! all i'm trying to do is cheer us up. go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if i care.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i don't want old sad bastard music either. i just want something i can ignore.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{but it's my new tape. my monday morning tape. i made it last night just for today.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yeah, well it's fucking monday afternoon. you should get out of bed earlier.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{don't you want to hear what's next?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what's next?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{play it.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{say it.}
<C>__{barry}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{"little latin lupe lu."}
<A>__{rob groans.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{mitch ryder and the detroit wheels?}
<C>__{barry}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{no. the righteous brothers.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{oh well. nevermind.}
<A>__{barry bristles and moves slowly in on dick.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{no, not nothing. what's wrong with the righteous brothers?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{nothing. i just prefer the other one.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{how can it be bullshit to state a preference?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{since when did this shop become a fascist regime?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{since you brought that bullshit tape in.}
<C>__{barry}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{great. that's the fun of working in a record store. playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to. i thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. i was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{we'll do it next monday.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{well what's the point in that?}
<A>__{from outside. hear the sound of skateboard wheels clacking and scraping, getting louder. rob, dick and barry stop fighting to listen, then each moves purposefully to a spot in the store. dick to the register, barry to the back, rob next to the door, as if bracing for a street fight. the sound gets closer, then stops. the door swings open to admit vince and justin, two fifteen year old skate punks. vince's hair is post apocolyptically hacked to different lengths, justin's in uniformly shaven with leopard spots dyed browse. rob follows them, watching their every move. dick counters from his perch, getting another angle. barry cracks his knuckles threateningly. vince and justin do their best browser impersonations. finally justin plucks a cd, and the two move to the counter.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{hey. didn't you steal that one already?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{justin}
<D>__{just this.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{that'll be fifteen twenty seven.}
<A>__{vince reaches into his deep pocket and pulls out a paper cup, with piece of paper attached that says "please help me. i'm retarded." he pours a mass of change and crumpled singles onto the counter. dick begins counting it out.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{isn't your name dick?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{that sucks. get it?}
<A>__{dick cracks a sad smile for a second. he bags the cd and vince and justin are off. rob walks back through the stock room door.}
