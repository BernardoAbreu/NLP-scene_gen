<L>__{interior supply room day}
<A>__{wayne and his crew have set up in the food supply room off from the cafeteria. being big, roomy, and unpopulated, it's perfect for an interview. there's eight l.a. county deputy sheriffs around the room along with wurlitzer. roger's setting up his sound equipment while unruly julie is checking her notebook. wurlitzer and a few deputies talk among themselves. camera moves from person to person without cutting.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<P>__{(to two deputies)}
<D>__{this is just for an interview, i was on the set of 'dukes of hazzard' once. it was a much bigger deal than this. they had a crew of maybe seventy five people.}
<A>__{camera moves to wayne and scott.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{we're gonna be talking over here. but i want enough freedom so if i wanna get up and move around, we can.}
<A>__{wayne grabs scott and walks him to the left.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{take him and walk him over this way.}
<P>__{(pretending scott's mickey)}
<D>__{so, mickey, killing mallory's parents, what the hell was that all about?}
<P>__{(pauses to scott)}
<D>__{then maybe take him to the window.}
<A>__{he walks scott to the window.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(pretending scott's mickey)}
<D>__{so, mickey, if you were let outta jail today, what's the first thing you'd do?}
<P>__{(pause to scott)}
<D>__{little shit like that. i don't wanna have to feel i gotta stay in the chairs. we're after a cinema verite, anything can happen, truth twenty four times a second kindda feel.}
<A>__{end of single shot. wurlitzer's talking with deputies.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{and when it's lunch time, they don't just go to mcdonalds. they got cooks there servin' great food. swedish meatballs...}
<A>__{wayne walks over to wurlitzer and deputies.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{how's everything coming, mr. gayle?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{everything's coming along just fine. phil, i wanted to know if i could have a small word with you.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{by all means.}
<A>__{wayne puts his hand on wurlitzer's shoulder. they walk around the room.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{you met the kids i have working for me? great bunch, aren't they?}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{oh yes, indeed. top flight.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{scott, genius cameraman, roger, magician with sound. unruly julie, i could sooner do without my arm than unruly julie.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{is that her real name?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{just a little nickname. yep, they're my kids and they're all i need. after working together these past coupla years, we're like well oiled machinery. no, more like a formula race car. no, scratch that one, too. what we're really like is a swiss watch. small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand.}
<A>__{wayne gives wurlitzer a moment to digest this.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{now, phil, i don't know if you've ever been on a set before }
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{ya know, i was.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(acting surprised)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{i was on the 'dukes of hazzard' set about eight years ago.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(still acting surprised)}
<D>__{well...small world. well, then, you know firsthand how hollywood does things. lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members }
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{oh, that 'dukes of hazzard' show, there was probably ninety five people there, maybe more.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{see what i mean? it's a funny business, isn't it?}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{it sure is.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{they got a asshole over here.}
<P>__{(pointing to his left)}
<D>__{a asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.}
<P>__{(points to his right)}
<D>__{a asshole perched up there.}
<P>__{(points straight up)}
<D>__{assholes everywhere. hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. what we're about is intimacy. we're about two people having a conversation. say i was interviewing you. all i want you to worry about is what i ask you. i want a trust to develop. if you're thinking about all this...}
<P>__{(indicates the hustle and bustle of a set)}
<D>__{...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.}
<A>__{wayne gives wurlitzer a chance to take this in.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{that's why my crew is only three...an invisible three.}
<P>__{(switching gears)}
<D>__{which brings me to what i wanted to talk to you about. i have to get mickey knox to relax...mickey knox to share what he's never shared before... mickey knox to open doors which 'till today have been closed. well, how can we expect him to do that when we got los angeles county sheriffs up the walls.}
<A>__{suddenly, things get short between the two men.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<P>__{(snorts)}
<D>__{well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{lose 'em.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{mr. gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous knox is?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{mr. wurlitzer, i assure you, i am very familiar with mickey knox's career.}
<A>__{they're out and out angry.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed }
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{don't recite the fact to me. i'm sure i know 'em better than you do.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. if i were to take my men away, mickey knox would snap your neck like a twig.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{one...i can take care of myself. i grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and i've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. mickey knox doesn't scare me. two...i'm a journalist, and i'm prepared to take that risk. three...it ain't gonna happen. believe me when i tell you, it is in mickey knox's own best interest to play this game according to hoyle.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{wait a minute. we've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what i want.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but seriously, phil, look at this.}
<A>__{wayne scans the room, counting the deputy sheriffs.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(counting)}
<D>__{we got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. i mean jesus christ, phil, that's too much. let's lose some of these guys.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{wayne, if it was anybody else }
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{phil, i'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. they hate him. he hates them. what kinda intimacy am i gonna create with all this hate in the air. even you and i feel it.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{what are we talking about?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{two guys?}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{okay. i will take two guys off.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{no, no, no, no, no, no, i mean only two guys.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{i can't do that. five guys.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{three.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{i will cut it in half. four guys, but that's it.}
