<L>__{exterior street sarajevo night}
<A>__{rock music echoes from several bars. carmen heads toward one, when an american iptf monitor stops her.}
<C>__{american iptf}
<D>__{that's a military bar. you want the party in there...}
<A>__{he points to big neon sign: the international bar. tiki lights illuminate a broad patio. a pig roasts on a spit. kathy follows carmen through dozens of off duty iptf, sfor and un workers who drink and trade stories with machismo. there's a palpable sexual tension in the air. bosnian waitresses flirt with officers. guys paw girls with trays.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{fuck me, we're outnumbered. good odds.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{hon, they're all yours.}
<A>__{they make their way through the crowded bar, feeling the officers' double takes. carmen smiles coyly at kathy, then zeroes in on jan van der velde, 35, handsome. he is surrounded by a group of iptf with dutch flags on their shoulders. carmen throws her arms around them, jovial.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{okay, fine, if you insist. mine's a jaegermeister.}
<A>__{jan laughs at carmen's forwardness, his eye on kathy. but she spots todd myers across the bar, and is on her way, when...}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{what about you? you don't have an order?}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{no. i'm the polite one.}

<D>__{i like polite.}
<A>__{carmen turns his head toward her.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{i'm gonna be the drunk one. let's get toasted.}
<A>__{kathy smiles, a little too old for this game. carmen leans into kathy's ear. she smiles, and moves off.}
<B>__{at the bar}
<A>__{kathy moves to todd and the americans, catching todd's eye, but is distracted by a waitress writhing on an italian soldier's lap. the waitress darts kathy a look, contemptuous. and the soldiers notice. one leers at kathy...}
<C>__{italian soldier}
<D>__{i'd pay double for a woman in uniform.}
<A>__{kathy looks him over.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{sorry pal, i'm not for sale.}
<A>__{the soldier is stung. the italians laugh.}
<C>__{todd myers }
<D>__{we're dyncorp. we're all for sale... kathy, right?}
<A>__{todd puts his arm around kathy, bringing her to a table of american iptf. they greet her, friendly.}
<C>__{todd myers }
<D>__{look the basic lay of the land is we have to work with the other nationals, but we don't mix with them at night.}
<A>__{jim higgins, 25, and even younger looking...}
<C>__{jim higgins}
<D>__{lucky those wops don't carry guns or we'd've had ourselves a situation. fucking unarmed mission. i was hoping we'd get to squeeze some off.}
<C>__{todd myers}
<D>__{at who? better odds you'll step on a land mine and what the hell's a gun gonna do for you then?}
<C>__{jim higgins}
<P>__{(embarrassed) i'd kill the fucker who}
<D>__{buried it.}
<A>__{everyone laughs. todd turns to kathy.}
<C>__{todd myers}
<D>__{you ever had to take someone down?}
<C>__{kathy}

<A>__{the others see she's the real deal. kathy feels good.}
