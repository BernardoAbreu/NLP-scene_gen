<L>__{exterior river bank day}
<A>__{a railroad bridge and highway span an almost bone dry creek bed. gathered beneath the overpass are the police, coroner, criminialists, and a local fbi. a sedan travels down a service road and stops nearby. two men exit, identify themselves as fbi and move to the crime scene. special agent gordon ramsey is well groomed, prides himself on professionalism, and follows the bureau party line. special agent peter novak is rough around the edges, introspective, and intense. a loner who marches to the tune of a peculiar drummer, he's unconventionally handsome with probing eyes. he moves slowly, observing the scene the world, for that matter from a unique perspective. as ramsey finds the fbi's local liaison agent cole novak oblivious to the people around him, touches dirt, smells the air, and examines road, river, bridge and sky.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{who found her?}
<A>__{cole nods at a visibly shaken workman seated in a patrol car.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{surveyor for the railroad... 'bout six this morning.}
<A>__{novak sees a female body wrapped in plastic and bound by wire. supervising the examination of the woman is fbi pathologist dr. theodore "teddy" lee, a polite, dapper southern gentleman.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{thanks for waiting, teddy.}
<A>__{teddy gives novak a friendly, respectful salute "my pleasure." novak dons gloves, nods to an fbi photographer and assists teddy lee in snipping wire and peeling back thick clear plastic. as the photographer reacts to a strong smell, teddy comments.}
<C>__{teddy lee}
<D>__{bleach.}
<A>__{as the man snaps pictures, ramsey and cole join them. sadly, novak recognizes the face.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{anne marie vicksey.}
<A>__{we recognize her, too.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{she the one from santa cruz?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{just graduated law school. single mom. had a two year old daughter.}
<A>__{he and teddy expose the bleached flesh of her torso, neither man surprised. coldly thorough, novak finds another of the killer's tell tale signs.}
<C>__{novak }
<P>__{(instructing the photographer)}
<D>__{the semen on her legs and abdomen.}
<A>__{flash! photos are taken.}
<C>__{teddy lee}
<D>__{someone looking after her little girl?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{grandparents. live over in davis.}
<A>__{novak looks into the dead white eyes of anne vicksey, trying to imagine the horrors she beheld. he moves to the creek and sees only a few inches of water. his eyes move from the drop site to the highway above.}
<C>__{teddy lee}
<D>__{the poor thing.}
<A>__{flash! we're up there now, on the overpass, with the photographer and novak, examining tire tracks in the soft shoulder. novak peers over the edge at the crime scene, steps back, and focuses on the highway imagining the killer's truck as it disappeared into the night.}
