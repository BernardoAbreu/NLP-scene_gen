<L>__{interior reordon's lab}
<A>__{instantly, watson covers his nose with a handkerchief.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(reeling)}
<D>__{bloody hell...}
<A>__{the room is stacked with an alarming amount of scientific and biological paraphernalia. some of it gives off a distinctly electrical hum. ungodly fragments of limbs and matter float in jars.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(inhaling deeply, loving it)}
<D>__{ammonium sulfate.}
<A>__{in the center of the room, something rotting. an experiment generating a massive stench, a seething cloud of flies. holmes and watson step closer to see: dead frogs. eyes opened impossibly wide, their bodies frozen in strange contortions, as if mid death rattle. holmes moves around the room, sniffing like a morbid perfumer. watson does his best not to gag.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(mumbles)}
<D>__{phosphorous... formaldehyde... hemlock...}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{appears he was attempting to follow occult formula with scientific practice.}
<A>__{watson moves to the stove, sees a sheaf of burnt papers. he digs through them, finds one piece not as burnt as the rest. a crest stamped on it, impossible to read. watson digs through his forensic bag, pulls out vials.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{has he any hydrochloric acid?}
<A>__{holmes shuffles a few bottles, tosses one to watson. watson catches it, starts pouring the acid, another chemical on a clean sheet of paper. holmes senses something, moves into the next room. he stops at an open window, smells the curtains:}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{irene was here.}
<A>__{watson presses the chemical soaked paper onto the burnt paper.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{why would she hire you to find him, if she planned to do the job herself?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{maybe it's not the man she's after, but something else. something he was working on?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{ferrocyanide. sucks the iron right out of the ink. long as it's not too burnt...}
<A>__{watson keeps rubbing the paper together, puts it by the lantern. slowly, faint words appear on the blank page. ghostly chemistry. watson sees the crest is blackwood's.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{he worked for blackwood.}
<A>__{holmes gets a whiff of something, raises an eyebrow. he starts walking back to the other room.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{there's one odor i can't put my finger on. sweet, almost like perfume... or sugar....}
<P>__{(stops, sniffs)}
<D>__{barley sugar.}
