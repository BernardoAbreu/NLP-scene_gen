<L>__{interior tilley's house bathroom night}
<A>__{tilley is in the tub, lathering himself. nora enters and sits on the side of the tub.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{you know, tilley, we hardly ever do things together.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{do things together that are enjoyable.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{what would we do together for it to be enjoyable?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{if we went on a picnic... it would be fun.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{i don't understand a picnic... we just go some place... we put a thing on the ground, and we eat.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{yes... it's nice to do that.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{why? i don't get it. it's better sitting at home and watching tv.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i think there's something nice about a picnic... it's fun.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{what's fun about it? ants get into the food... there's bees. i don't get it. we have to drive, it takes maybe an hour to get there, then you sit in grass and eat. why is that fun?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i just thought it might be nice to do something together, that's all... thought it might be fun.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{it doesn't sound like fun to me... you take the stuff you've got here in the house, you take it someplace to eat it. it's just as much fun eating in front of the tv, and we do that together, don't we? no ants and no bees... much more comfortable.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{it's not the same thing.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{scrub my back, will ya, nora.}
<A>__{nora picks up the back brush, puts soap on it and starts scrubbing tilley's back.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{not too hard!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{don't get me wrong, i'm willing to do anything with you. i'm just a little stymied by a picnic. if you want to go, send me a postcard.}
<A>__{nora drops the brush in the tub and walks out of the bathroom.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{what did i say?}
