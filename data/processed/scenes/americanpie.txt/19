<C>__{stifler}

<A>__{she's about to take a sip.}

<D>__{really?}
<C>__{stifler}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{she's totally enthralled. nervous, she raises the beer again to take a sip. then stifler moves in. takes the beer from her and sets it down. starts kissing her. she breaks it off.}

<C>__{stifler}
<P>__{(shifty)}

<A>__{avoiding her look, he raises the beer to take a sip.}
<C>__{sophomore chick}
<P>__{(a little angry)}
<D>__{steve! you could at least look at me when you say that.}
<A>__{stifler stops and sighs, the beer inches from his mouth. lowers it. stares her in the eye.}
<C>__{stifler}
