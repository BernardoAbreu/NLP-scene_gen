<L>__{interior baxter's office day}
<A>__{bud ushers fran in, and is confronted by a strange couple necking in the corner. he gestures them out, crosses to his desk.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{miss kubelik, i would like your honest opinion. i've had this in my desk for a week cost me fifteen dollars but i just couldn't get up enough nerve to wear it }
<A>__{from under the desk he has produced a hatbox, and out of the hatbox a black bowler, which he now puts on his head.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{it's what they call the junior executive model. what do you think?}
<A>__{fran looks at him blankly, absorbed in her own thoughts.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{guess i made a boo boo, huh?}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(paying attention again)}
<D>__{no i like it.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{really? you mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{of course not.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{maybe if i wore it a little more to the side }
<P>__{(adjusting hat)}
<D>__{is that better?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{much better.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me how about the three of us going out this evening you and me and the bowler stroll down fifth avenue sort of break it in }
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{this is a bad day for me.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i understand. christmas family and all that }
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i'd better get back to my elevator. i don't want to be fired.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{oh, you don't have to worry about that. i have quite a bit of influence in personnel. you know mr. sheldrake?}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(guardedly)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{he and i are like this.}
<P>__{(crosses his fingers)}
<D>__{sent me a christmas card. see?}
<A>__{he has picked up a christmas card from his desk, shows it to fran. it is a photograph of the sheldrake clan grouped around an elaborate christmas tree mr. and mrs. sheldrake, the two boys in military school uniforms, and a big french poodle. underneath it says: season's greetings from the sheldrakes emily, jeff, tommy, jeff jr., and figaro.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(studying the card ruefully)}
<D>__{makes a cute picture.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i thought maybe i could put in a word for you with mr. sheldrake get you a little promotion how would you like to be an elevator starter?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{no problem. why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays i could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling }
<P>__{(touching the brim of his bowler)}
<D>__{ you sure this is the right way to wear it?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you don't think it's tilted a little too much }
<A>__{fran takes her compact out of her uniform pocket, opens it, hands it to bud.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{here.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(examining himself in the mirror)}
<D>__{after all, this is a conservative firm i don't want people to think i'm an entertainer }
<A>__{his voice trails off. there is something familiar about the cracked mirror of the compact and the fleur de lis pattern on the case confirms his suspicion. fran notices the peculiar expression on his face.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(with difficulty)}
<D>__{the mirror it's broken.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i know. i like it this way makes me look the way i feel.}
<A>__{the phone has started to ring. bud doesn't hear it. he closes the compact, hands it to fran.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{your phone.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(picks up phone from desk)}
<D>__{yes?}
<P>__{(throws a quick look at fran)}
<D>__{just a minute.}
<P>__{(covers mouthpiece; to fran)}
<D>__{if you don't mind this is sort of personal}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{all right. have a nice christmas.}
<A>__{she exits, closing the door. bud takes his hand off the mouthpiece.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(every word hurts)}
<D>__{yes, mr. sheldrake no, i didn't forget the tree is up and the tom and jerry mix is in the refrigerator yes, sir same to you.}
<A>__{he hangs up, stands there for a moment, the bowler still on his head, the noise from the party washing over him. he slowly crosses to the clothes tree. picks up his coat a new, black chesterfield. with the coat over his arm, he starts out of the office.}
