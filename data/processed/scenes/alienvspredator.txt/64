<A>__{the predators have reached the pyramid. one of the predators checks his wrist computer. the nature of the homing signal has changed. the electronic pulse has become more frantic and insistent. they exchange concerned looks. this clearly was not part of the plan. and the predator's take off running, sprinting into the pyramid.}

<A>__{thomas' eyes have found something.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{at the bottom of the sacrificial slabs, beneath the mummified bodies, an alien egg has suddenly appeared. it sits snugly in the bowl shaped indentation which lex had observed earlier. the stone slabs themselves are silently splitting apart, allowing the alien eggs to rise up into the indentations from within.}
<C>__{thomas }
<D>__{there. another. one more.}
<A>__{now all seven sacrificial slabs have an egg on them. there is a long silence. the first egg begins to open. one by one the other eggs begin to open. rousseau pulls out a colt.45, keeping it at her side.}
