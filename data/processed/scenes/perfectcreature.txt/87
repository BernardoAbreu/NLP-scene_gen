<L>__{int: jamestown subway exit continuing}
<A>__{the streets are flooding like bangkok in the monsoon; rain pouring off awnings that hang out over the street. the streets are full; prostitutes, drug peddlers, apothecary shops, the industrial revolution low down and dirty. there is a fight breaking out between two men who are dressed like punk rockers. several people are alighting from a subway exit; the exit has "jamestown brougham" on a nouveaux styled sign that might remind you of a paris or barcelona metro, only dirtier. we see lilly in the distance, in her dark jacket, emerge from the subway. she begins the short walk to her apartment. the streets are crowded and there are plenty of maori people in this area, so there's plenty of food stalls; the air is filled with the sound of evening prayers. lilly stops at one of the food stalls and starts picking up vegetables. a maori man comes out and smiles and they start talking in the local dialect. she buys a live eel. cut to across the street, in a doorway, we see a very weedy, sick looking guy this is freddy. standing next to him is a prostitute, swaying from the effects of laudanum.}

<D>__{soon enough my cherub. i've not finished with you yet.}
<A>__{he sucks on something that looks like a ventaline inhaler, then pockets it, licks his lips and begins heading off down the street, the drunk prostitute dragged along. cut to again, lilly from a distance, walking along the street which is more deserted, now carrying a bag full of groceries. as she walks we begin to hear voices; violent, arguing. lilly approaches an alleyway, the raised voices becoming louder. she slowly places her bag on the ground and then pulls out a revolver. she edges into the alleyway.}
