<A>__{a basketball sits on the ground near the middle of the court. suddenly the asphalt starts to vibrate and the basketball rolls a few inches. then: there is a grinding noise and the surface begins to separate at the half court line. the basketball falls through the widening hole and bounces off the wing of the rising x jet. lift off. the jet turns and clears the hanger before blasting off into the night sky.}
