<L>__{exterior practice field day}
<A>__{scrimmage. joe hands off to darnell. he sweeps right, cuts it up, blows past the end. in a spectacular display of broken field running, darnell breaks to the sideline, cuts back, eluding the corner back, and stiffarms the safety. alvin, pursuing the play, finally tackles him from behind, stripping the ball at the same time. there's a wild scramble for the fumble. darnell is crushed under the pile, as the defense recovers it, ruining an otherwise brilliant run. the players unpile to reveal darnell, writhing on the ground, the wind knocked out of him. ray griffen runs by to take his place.}
<C>__{griffen}
<D>__{hey, nice writhing, jefferson. you got all the moves.}
<C>__{winters}
<P>__{(shouting to the team)}
<D>__{allright, move it up. let's go, 15 yards, run the next play.}
<A>__{the scrimmage moves up 15 yards leaving darnell behind. winters sprints over to lattimer, grabs him by the face mask.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{cut the necktie tackle horseshit. you think you're in some kinda highlight reel? he left you huggin' air. target his guts. drive right through his abdomen. i wanta see snot bubbles in his nose. i wanta see shit in his underwear.}
<A>__{lattimer nods chastised. winters moves over to check on darnell.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{you injured, jefferson, or just hurt?}
<C>__{darnell}
<P>__{(gasping)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{if you're hurt, you can still play. if you're injured you can't. are you hurt or are you injured?}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{i think i'm just hurt.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{o.k., then get up.}
<A>__{winters extends a hand. darnell grabs it, struggles shakily to his feet}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{nice run. think what it coulda done for us if we still had the ball.}
<P>__{(handing him the ball)}
<D>__{this is a football. i want you to carry it with you wherever you go. never let it out of your sight.}
<P>__{(to the rest of the team)}
<D>__{any of you see him on campus, take a swipe at the ball. try to knock it out of his hands. recover it.}
<P>__{(to darnell again)}
<D>__{if anybody, but you, returns this ball to me, you'll wish you'de never been born.}
<A>__{winters wheels off leaving a wobbly darnell alone with his football.}
<C>__{winters }
<D>__{this isn't gonna get it, goddamnit.}
