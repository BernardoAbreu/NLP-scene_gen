<L>__{interior rita harrison's century city office day}
<A>__{a century city lawyer spins in front of our eyes. it's sam's pov as he sits in a chair that spins in the center of rita harrison's lavish, penthouse office. now we see the panoramic of los angeles. now the dots in the lichtenstein on the wall whirl past us. now the door swings open and rita harrison and her assistant burst in. rita moves in opposite circles around the room. looking for something. in fact, as we watch rita, we realize that she never stops moving. period. ten steps ahead of anyone, too much energy, too much caffeine, not enough food. if she slowed down a beat she might get vulnerable. can't have that. can't be wrong. can't really look you in the eye. can't help it if she's smarter than anyone else in the room. any room. any time.}
