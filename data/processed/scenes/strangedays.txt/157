<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior underground garage tick's van}
<A>__{lenny and mace pull in with a squeal of brakes and park the car. sound of rock music some kind of refried psychedelia coming from tick's van down the ramp. mace and lenny get out, approaching the van. hearing tires squeal, they turn to see max pull up. he gets out wearing an ill fitting rental tux. music louder, echoing in the empty garage, even though the van is shut tight.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{sounds like tick's already celebrating.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{you may be a little overdressed for this party.}
<P>__{(lenny pounds on the van door)}
<D>__{yo, tick! it's lenny. open up!}
<A>__{mace slips out her .380, on alert.}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(knocks again, then opens rear van door)}
<D>__{tick, i got to talk to you, man... oh shit.}
<A>__{tick's slumped in the back of the van with playback trodes on his head. he's breathing, but otherwise he's still. near lifeless. a cyborg after a power outage. all the equipment in the van is trashed.}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(as he starts to examine tick)}
<D>__{he's been cooked off}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{is he dead?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{no. but his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs. they put an amplifier in line to boost the signal till it french fried his brain.}
<A>__{mace hits "off" on the built in cd player. the sudden silence is creepy. lenny gets right in front of tick's eyes, shouting at him, at the top of his lungs. tick's pov: we see a roaring blizzard of inchoate static. somewhere in the middle of it is a suggestion of lenny's face, almost invisible. we hear the tiniest ghost of his voice, like a radio playing two blocks away.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{he's totally cut off from the outer world.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{how long does it last?}
<P>__{(off lenny's look)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{those two psycho cops are on a slash and burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{this seems a little sophisticated for them. these are not subtle guys.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{there's more to this whole thing than you think.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{whattya mean?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{all i'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes. i've heard stuff.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{what stuff?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{smoke. rumors. i've heard stuff about a death squad. a group a guys loyal to the hardline school. guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.}
<A>__{lenny takes this in. all the fight goes out of him. this is just too overwhelming.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{yeah. so don't walk near me in public, alright.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{thanks, buddy. see... things weren't bad enough. they weren't fucking bad enough!}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{the only card we have to play is the tape. you know, we get it to the media somehow...}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{yeah, right, blow it open.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history. they'll see the fucking smoke from canada.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{okay... what about strickland?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no. bad idea.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{who's strickland?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{deputy commissioner palmer strickland. the sanctimonious prick who busted me out. his ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it. i know this guy. if there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{listen to me, lenny... stay away from cops. all cops. you have no way of knowing who you can trust.}
<A>__{mace looks from one to the other with a growing expression of outrage.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{so you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen? it happened! the lapd executed one of the most important black men in america! who the fuck are you to bury this?!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{fine. do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains? the gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground. and when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves. it'll be all out war and you know it.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you really want that on your head?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{hey, max, mace... whoa... time out. max mace}
<P>__{(together annoyed)}
<D>__{what!?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{whoever killed iris did tick. it's the same sick wirehead shit. same reason... to burn the trail. if faith knows anything about this, and i think she does, then she's on the list. so... who's driving?}
