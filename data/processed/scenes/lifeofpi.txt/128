<D>__{...the cook and the sailor were already onboard. the cook threw me a lifebuoy and pulled me aboard. mother held onto some bananas and made it to the lifeboat. the cook, the cook was a disgusting man. he ate a rat. we had food enough for weeks, but he found the rat in the first few days and he killed it, and dried it in the sun and ate it. he was such a brute, that man. but he was resourceful. it was his idea to build the raft to catch fish. we would have died in those first few days without him. the sailor was the same man who brought rice with gravy, the buddhist. we didn't understand much of what he said, only that he was suffering. i can still hear him the happy buddhist who only ate rice with gravy. he had broken his leg horribly in the fall. we tried to set it as best we could, but the leg became infected and the cook told us we had to do something or he'd die. the cook said he'd do it, but mother and i had to hold the man down. and i believed him we needed to do it.}

<A>__{so... i kept saying, "i'm sorry, i'm sorry", but he just kept.. looking at me, his eyes so... i will never understand the point of that man's suffering. we didn't save him, of course. he died. the morning after, the cook caught his first dorado, and i didn't understand what he'd done at first, but mother did, and i'd never seen her so angry. 'stop whining and be happy,' he said. "we need more food or we'll die. that was the whole pointerior' 'what was the point?' mother asked. "you let that poor boy die in order to get bait? you monster!' the cook got furious. he started towards her with his fists raised, and mother slapped him hard, right across the face. i was stunned. i thought he was going to kill her right then. but he didn't. the cook didn't stop at bait either, no. the sailor, he went the same way the rat went the cook was a resourceful man. it was a week later that he... because of me. because i couldn't hold onto a stupid turtle. it slipped out of my hands and swam away and the cook came up and punched me on the side of the head and my teeth clacked and i saw stars. i thought he was going to hit me again, but then mother started pounding on him with her fists and screaming, "monster! monster!" she yelled at me to go to the raft "nee poda!" i thought she was coming with me or i'd never have... i don't know why i didn't make her go first. i think about that every day. i jumped over and turned back just as the knife came out. there wasn't anything i could do; i couldn't look away... he threw her body overboard. then the sharks came. i saw what they... i saw. the next day i killed him. he didn't even fight back. he knew he had gone too far, even by his standards. he'd left the knife out on the bench. and i did to him what he did to the sailor. he was such an evil man, but worse still, he brought the evil out in me.}
