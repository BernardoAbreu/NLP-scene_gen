<A>__{luke dresses in readiness for the evacuation as his attending medical droid stands by.}
<C>__{medical droid}
<D>__{sir, it will take quite a while to evacuate the t forty sevens.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, forget the heavy equipment. there's plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports.}
<C>__{medical droid}
<D>__{take care, sir.}

<D>__{thanks.}

<A>__{pilots, gunners, and r2 units scurry about. luke, pulling on his heavy weather jacket, is headed toward a row of armored speeders. he stops at the rear of the millennium falcon, where han and chewie are trying to repair the right lifter with even more haste than before.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{chewie, take care of yourself, okay?}
<A>__{as luke pats chewie on the arm, chewie puts his arms around luke and gives him a tight hug. han is discussing the lifter with a repair droid when he sees luke.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{hi, kid.}
<P>__{(to droid)}
<D>__{there's got to be a reason for it. check it at the other end. wait a second.}
<P>__{(to luke)}
<D>__{you all right?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{be careful.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you, too.}
<A>__{luke smiles, then waves at his friend and walks on. after a few steps, he stops and looks back. han glances up and the two exchange a silent communication, each wishing the other safety, happiness many things, all difficult to verbalize.}
