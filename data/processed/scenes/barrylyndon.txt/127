<D>__{will we always leave it at this?}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{always, my dear one, never any further. love is a child to be pacified with trifles. a full diet can only kill it.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i know better than you do. love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{our abstinence makes our love immortal. if i loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now i should love you even more. but i should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.}

<D>__{sir william cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet i envy him more than any man in christendom. he enjoys a privilege of which i am deprived. he may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.}
<A>__{she silences him with her fingertips.}

<D>__{shall i tell you something i believed what was called love came after the union and i was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. i saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead. and so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, i was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{o, my dearest love. enough! i beg you. stop believing in your experience. you have never known love. my very soul is leaving me! catch it on your lips, and give me yours!}
<A>__{they kiss ardently.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{to make a long story short, her ladyship and i were in love six hours after we met; and after i once got into her ladyship's good graces, i found innumerable occasions to improve my intimacy, and was scarcely ever out of her company.}
