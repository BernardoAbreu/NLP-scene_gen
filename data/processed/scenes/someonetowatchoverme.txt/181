<L>__{interior brooklyn restaurant evening}
<A>__{the lights of new york beginning to sparkle against a darkening sky; mike and ellie at a table that looks out on the east river. it's an ok restaurant, not the poshest in the world. ellie finds herself carrying most of the conversation. they scan menus to order.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{hey, we qualify for the senior citizens early bird special... did you see tommy today? he misses you...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{well. this'll be over soon. venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{i'd like you to switch to the day shift, mike. to be home for dinner. helen insists that t.j. be home for dinner... that's why he's on the morning shift.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{well, t.j.'s... seniority... and all.}
<P>__{(evasive)}
<D>__{i will talk to garber about it.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(girds herself)}
<D>__{i already did. i mean, i talked to his wife, and she talked to him...}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(stopped)}
<D>__{you talked to his wife?}
<A>__{close on mike: incredulous.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{my wife talks to his wife about what shift i'm gonna take?}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{what's the difference?}
<A>__{mike is nonplused; not knowing how to respond.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{unless there's some particular reason why it feels better to be around her at night.}
<A>__{he shakes his head, dismissively.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{is there, mike?}
<A>__{no response; mike having trouble with it. close on ellie: sensing deception. her eyes begin to glisten. close on mike: seeing her distress. unable to hide his own. she looks at him and knowing him as well as she does, is certain. she puts a hand in front of her mouth in an attempt not to cry.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{what, what is it? is it serious or what...? quit looking at me like that! what's with this ridiculous silence?!}
<A>__{her eyes flush with tears.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{goddamn. i never thought this would happen to me... you fuckin' sonofabitch...}
<A>__{she upsets her setting, getting up from the table, shaking him off.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i just want you off the case. get off it, or don't come home.}
<P>__{(her voice trembling)}
<D>__{and i want you to remember... when we're old... that when this awful thing happened... i behaved like a lady.}
<P>__{(embittered)}
<D>__{the kind of "lady" you apparently prefer.}
<C>__{waiter}
<P>__{(approaching)}
<D>__{we got some specials.}
<A>__{she bolts from the room; mike following her.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(to the waiter)}
<D>__{we'll be right back.}
