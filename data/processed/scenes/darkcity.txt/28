<L>__{interior exterior various}
<A>__{tight rushing along lengths of rusted pipe, at blinding speed. the cylinder races around corners. it clanks and grinds. hurtles up the side of a building. then plummets underground. rushes through darkness.}
<L>__{exterior bridge night}
<A>__{the camera moves along a bridge like structure. an enclosed corridor supported by rotting wooden pylons. under the bridge, pipes spew sewage into stagnant water. angle on white walking seen through a series of illuminated, dirty, windows. he occasionally glances into the bowl he holds before him.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{tight on the fish swimming weakly in the soup. angle on white he stops, looks up at o.s. sound of clattering metal. a pipe runs the length of the corridor the invisible clanging cylinder races away, into darkness. then the silence is shattered by a piercing series of screams somewhere in the building. white hurriedly moves towards the source.}
<B>__{another corridor}
<A>__{white rounds a corner, stops, notices a small rectangular hole in a wall. another scream, weaker now he runs to the hole in the wall and looks through.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{a small, very ordered room. a fake fireplace bathes the room in a warm glow. white cranes his neck forward, stretches his head through the hole. he can see into an adjoining room to his right two dark figures stand over a man on the floor lying in a pool of dark crimson. the man looks up itis fredrick just as both dark figures stab him repeatedly with bloody daggers. he doesnit scream this time, just gags on blood running from his mouth. suddenly a sliding door slams onto the back of whiteis neck, traps his head in the hole. he struggles, tries to free himself. drops the bowl of soup. it shatters on the hard floor, makes a mess. inside the bathroom the killers look up at the smashing noise. back in the corridor white pulls with all his strength. the door gives and he stumbles backwards. he is about to run away but glances at the floor. the fish is flapping about still alive.}
