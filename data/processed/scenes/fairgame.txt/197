<L>__{exterior washington monument. day.}
<A>__{a bright dc day. joggers. lunchtime office workers. valerie walks alone through the park. she sits down on a bench next to jim pavitt.}
<C>__{pavitt}
<D>__{thank you for coming here today. i wanted to convey my outrage to you in person. in all my experience, nothing has disgusted me like this business.}
<C>__{pavitt }
<D>__{i know it's not easy for you, but i want you to know how much the agency appreciates your silence in the light of this matter. we know how damaging this has been to you. we can't afford for this knife fight to go on any longer.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{i get death threats every day. people threatening to kill my husband. hurt my children. i went to the agency and i requested security to protect my family. it was declined. because quote "my circumstances fall outside budget protocols." if this is a knife fight, right now, sir we're fighting it alone.}
<A>__{pavitt starts to chuckle.}
<C>__{pavitt}
<D>__{joe wilson versus the white house. well, all i can say is good luck. but as a friend, i feel i should tell you that those men..}
<A>__{he points down the hill at the white house.}
<C>__{pavitt}
<D>__{those few men in that building over there, that small white house, are the most powerful men in the history of the world. how much of a stretch do you think it would be for them to take on joe wilson?}
<A>__{he looks at her.}
<C>__{pavitt}
<D>__{joe's out there on his own valerie. but i know we can trust you. speak to your husband.}
<A>__{he turns and walks off, leaving her alone, looking at the white house.}
