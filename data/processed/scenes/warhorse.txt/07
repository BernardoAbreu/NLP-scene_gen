<L>__{exterior stables. later.}
<A>__{albert loads some oats into a bucket and approaches joey in the field.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{right. let's make a start then.}
<A>__{as albert approaches, joey nervously runs in circles, then stops on a dime, looking at albert suspiciously.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{it's oats. very tasty, that is. it's beef and gravy to us!}
<A>__{albert squats down. he shows the food. joey catches the scent on the air, but still hesitates and shies away.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{come on...}
<A>__{this time, albert takes a new tact, almost turning his body fully away from joey, but keeping the bucket extended. albert slowly backs towards joey, speaking gently all the while.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{i bet you're missing your mother. look at you... first time without your mum. first time away from home. but you're not alone, are you. in fact. cos i'm `ere...}
<A>__{feeling safer, joey moves toward the bucket of oats and starts to eat.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{it's alright. it's alright.}
<A>__{albert reaches out his hand and touches joey. and with a slight start, the horse relaxes into albert's hand, feeling safe with the boy. albert stares at the distinctive white cross on joey's forehead. joey calms.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{i'm gonna call you joey. understand? joey. that's you. and i'm albert. it's alright, you're mine now. you're mine.}
<A>__{albert strokes joey's forehead. joey lifts his head and the two stare at each other in close proximity.}
