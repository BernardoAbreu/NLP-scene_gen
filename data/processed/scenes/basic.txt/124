<L>__{exterior louisiana bayou last night}
<A>__{lightning, thunder, and rain as nunez runs unarmed through the thick brush. somewhere behind him the other five fan out, rifles up, following his trail, ready to kill.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{it was insanity. we were hunting a man down to kill him.}
<B>__{on mueller}
<A>__{making his way down embankment, m l6 out, ready for anything. from behind him, movement...}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{he got mueller first.}
<A>__{nunez tackles him at full speed, feet slipping on the wet hill, and the two tumble head first into a gully. punching, kicking, biting, anything to stop the other man. nunez, choking mueller as he strains to reach his gun...}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{roberto...}
<A>__{with a heave, nunez snaps his neck. mueller lies still.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{he took his gun. used it on childs.}
<A>__{nunez spins, seeing childs behind him. he dives as childs fires! hits the ground in a roll, comes up with mueller's rifle, and shoots blowing childs back against the wet rocks.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{i can't imagine what it was like. having your friends try to kill you...}
<A>__{nunez slumps against the gully's wall, breathing hard. in agony over what he's just had to do.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{but you do what you have to survive.}
<A>__{closing his eyes, nunez steels himself. wipes the blood from his hands and climbs out of the gully.}
<B>__{elsewhere}
<A>__{pike, creeping through the foliage. trying to listen for sounds of movement through the storm. his eyes narrow as he hears a high pitched whine... the bullet hits his forehead dead center. he crumples. pull back to reveal nunez in a tree, thirty meters away. lowering his rifle. he climbs down.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{kendall and i found dunbar a couple minutes later.}
