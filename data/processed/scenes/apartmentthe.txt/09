<L>__{interior the apartment evening}
<A>__{bud snaps on the lights, drops the mail and the key on a small table, looks around with distaste at the mess his visitors have left behind. he sniffs the stale air, crosses to the window, pulls up the shade, opens it wide. now he takes off his hat and raincoat, gathers up the remains of the cocktail party from the coffee table. loaded down with glasses, pitcher, empty vodka bottle, ice bowl and potato chips, he starts toward the kitchen. the doorbell rings. bud stops, undecided what to do with the stuff in his hands, then crosses to the hall door, barely manages to get it open. mr. kirkeby barges in past him.}

<D>__{the little lady forgot her galoshes.}
<A>__{he scours the room for the missing galoshes.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{mr. kirkeby, i don't like to complain but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.}
<C>__{kirkeby}
<D>__{i know, buddy boy, i know. but those things don't always run on schedule like a greyhound bus.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i don't mind in the summer but on a rainy night and i haven't had any dinner yet }
<C>__{kirkeby}
<D>__{sure, sure. look, kid i put in a good word for you with sheldrake, in personnel.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(perking up)}
<D>__{mr. sheldrake?}
<C>__{kirkeby}
<D>__{that's right. we were discussing our department manpower wise and promotion wise }
<P>__{(finds the galoshes behind a chair)}
<D>__{ and i told him what a bright boy you were. they're always on the lookout for young executives.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{thank you, mr. kirkeby.}
<C>__{kirkeby}
<P>__{(starting toward door)}
<D>__{you're on your way up, buddy boy. and you're practically out of liquor.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i know. mr. eichelberger in the mortgage loan department last night he had a little halloween party here }
<C>__{kirkeby}
<D>__{well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth and put my name on it.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{yes, mr. kirkeby. you still owe me for the last two bottles }
<C>__{kirkeby}
<D>__{i will pay you on friday.}
<P>__{(in the open doorway)}
<D>__{and whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?}
<A>__{he exits, shutting the door.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(making a mental note)}
<D>__{cheese crackers.}
<A>__{he carries his load into the kitchen. the kitchen is minute and cluttered. on the drainboard are an empty vermouth bottle, some ice cube trays, a jar with one olive in it, and a crumpled potato chip bag. bud comes in, dumps his load on the drainboard, opens the old fashioned refrigerator. he takes out a frozen chicken dinner, turns the oven on, lights it with a match, rips the protective paper off the aluminum tray and shoves it in. now he starts to clean up the mess on the drainboard. he rinses the cocktail glasses, is about to empty the martini pitcher into the sink, thinks better of it. he pours the contents into a glass, plops the lone olive out of the jar, scoops up the last handful of potato chips, toasts an imaginary companion, and drinks up. then he pulls a wastebasket from under the sink. it is brimful of liquor bottles, and bud adds the empty vodka and vermouth bottles and the olive jar. picking up the heavy receptacle, he carries it through the living room toward the hall door.}
