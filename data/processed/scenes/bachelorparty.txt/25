<L>__{interior dr. stan stahl's office day}
<A>__{dr. stan is rick's older brother and a proctologist. although he's only in his early thirties, he thinks and acts like someone in their early 70's. a little on the pompous side, stan is never without his pipe.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{okay, rick, hold out your arm.}
<A>__{he crosses to a sterile container and takes out a syringe.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{you wouldn't hurt your own brother, would you?}
<P>__{(looking at the needle cautiously)}
<D>__{i changed my mind. i don't need a blood test. the marriage is off. i }
<A>__{just then, stan sticks the needle in his arm.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you always were sneaky, stan, very sneaky.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{rick, marriage will be good for you. it's done wonders for me.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{true, you're a lot handsomer now. don't you have enough blood already?}
<C>__{stan}
<P>__{(without much conviction)}
<D>__{you won't miss a thing about being single... the wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... god, i miss that.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{stan, you're depressing me... hey, i didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. just take a couple of gallons, okay?}
<A>__{stan removes the needle and hands rick a cotton ball.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{that's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.}
<C>__{stan}
<P>__{(returning to this world)}
<D>__{okay, rick, all finished. i can't wait for that bachelor party... i need the action.}
<A>__{camera follows them as they go out into the hall.}
<C>__{stan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't say anything to my wife about it.}
<A>__{they pass an open examining room. stan's wife, tina, is also a doctor and is examining an old man. she's not as tiny as her name suggests. in face, she's more like over sized.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{hi, tina.}
<A>__{rick moves to hug her and he notices that tina has her finger up the old guy's ass.}
<C>__{tina}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{rick...}
<P>__{(to patient)}
<D>__{mr. goldsmith, this is my brother in law. he's getting married.}
<C>__{patient}
<P>__{(without turning around)}
<D>__{congratulations.}
<A>__{tina turns to a nurse.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{nurse, will you take over?}
<A>__{the nurse shrugs and sticks her finger up the patient's rear end as tina hugs rick.}
<C>__{tina}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm so happy for you.}
<A>__{rick hugs her, uneasily trying to make sure her right hand doesn't come anywhere near his face.}
