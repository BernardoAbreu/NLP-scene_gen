<L>__{interior jewelry store day}
<A>__{the jewel thief pulls off his ski mask to reveal he is korda. his face is sweaty. hair matted. angle widens to show five very scared hostages: a jeweler, middle aged, balding. the male manager, good looking, thirties, three piece suit. two salesgirls, nicely dressed, late twenties. a female customer, gray haired hillsborough matron. they are all seated against the wall. there are two fatalities lying on the floor. the guard and one of the jewelers. korda points his gun at the manager and the other jeweler and motions to the dead bodies.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{drag them behind the counter.}
<A>__{the two men reluctantly get to their feet and commence the grim task. the two salesgirls watch korda fearfully. the older female customer seems to be in a lesser state of reality. her eyes are a bit far away. korda moves over to the remaining display cases that haven't been looted. with the barrel of his gun, he smashes the glass, reaches in and picks out the jewelry. he dumps it in an open satchel already half filled with packets of raw gemstones and gold chains. suddenly, the older woman customer gets to her feet. she seems fairly out of it. maybe in shock. she starts walking toward the front door frowning with dissatisfaction.}
<C>__{woman customer}
<D>__{i'm not staying here another minute. salesgirl #1}
<P>__{(panicky)}
<D>__{no, mrs. dotson.}
<A>__{korda rushes around the display case.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{come here, hag.}
<A>__{he grabs a handful of the woman's coiffed gray hair and drags her away from the door. she shrieks. the manager takes a step toward korda.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{leave her alone!}
<A>__{korda pistol whips her across the forehead and drops her unconscious to the floor then turns the gun on the manager.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{you're a brave one, aren't you?}
<A>__{the manager glares at him. he's about korda's size. he thinks about making a run at him.}
<D>__{salesgirl #2}
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{sit down, doug.}
<A>__{a long beat... the manager sits back down on the floor with the other hostages. salesgirl 1 is giving aid to the old woman. korda looks down at her.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{if she's not conscious when it's time to leave, i will have to kill her.}
<A>__{korda goes back to the display cases to collect the rest of the gems.}
