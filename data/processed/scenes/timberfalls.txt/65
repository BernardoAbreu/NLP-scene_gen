<A>__{mike enters to find a sewing machine, some yarn, an antique radio, but more importantly, no sheryl. he steps over to the radio, when he notices... an inch thick layer of dust covers the radio. he swipes it with his finger. this thing hasn't been used in years. mike turns, steps on a throw rug laying in the center of the floor... his foot sinks a little. mike tests the floor board again. it's rickety. he pulls the rug out... reveal: a trap door. mike grabs the latch, lifts it open.}
