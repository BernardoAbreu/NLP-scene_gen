<D>__{you got his hands. beautiful hands. i didn't even know. that night. when they we killed him, that you were already alive inside me. life's like that. grows right out of death.}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{but if it's him. if he's really come back, won't he know us? love us?}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{sure, if it was really him. but it isn't that simple. jimmy's body died a long time ago. and his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, i suppose.}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{but how do you know? maybe he just wanted to see us? and now he's gone again. and you've all killed my father for the second time.}
