<L>__{exterior "ghetto" morning}
<A>__{riley and charlie walk down a street into the city's "ghetto" zone, which is lined with taverns, gambling clubs, strip joints, like a boom town from alaskan gold rush days. buyers and sellers lurk in the shadows, copulating, dealing drugs. iley is welcomed by nearly everyone he passes, greeting them in return with a smile and a nod, handing some bills to a father with a young son, patting an old man on the back.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{wanna get a drink, riley? just ook at me, you can tell i could use a drink.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{later. gotta see a man about a car.}
<P>__{(}
<A>__{charlie follows riley, who strides into... ...an alley, surprised to find a cadre of rough looking revolutionaries, led by mulligan, a defiant man who stands on a soapbox. a small audience is gathered in front of him. he takes a swig from a bottle of whiskey.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{irish accent) how long are you gonna let him push you around? if there was enough of us...if you all would join up with us...we could pull him down off his throne!}
<A>__{some of the people in the audience nervously shift their eyes to the fiddler's green high rise ten blocks away.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{you can't fix a place like this, mulligan. you just have to get out of it.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{we've got the firepower, riley. if you and your friends would come in with us, we'd be unstoppable.}
<A>__{mulligan holds out his bottle to riley, who passes it to charlie, who takes a swig.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{everyone's stoppable.}
<A>__{we hear the sound of a boy coughing. mulligan's son brian stands behind him, looking feverish.}
<C>__{mulligan}
<D>__{you alright, son?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i'm fine, dad.}
<A>__{as riley starts past, he stops, pulls something from his pocket, and presses it into mulligan's palm.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{antibiotics. for your boy.}
<A>__{mulligan looks down with gratitude at a bottle his hand. when he looks up again, riley is gone.}
