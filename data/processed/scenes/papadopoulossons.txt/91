<L>__{interior mortimer, rolf & jones board room. day 10.}
<A>__{sophie, rob, harry and lars a scandinavian banker are sitting round the boardroom table.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{with the help of lars and the norske velconan bank, we aim to buy pap and sons back from the receivers.}
<C>__{lars}
<D>__{also, i have to say harry that i believe there is an intuitive bond between the greek and the nordic peoples, yah? and so, maybe the very first vikings were descended from ancient greeks, somewhere in the deep mists of time. and so it's so... so wagnerian, yah?}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{we should point out the new approach.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{to buy papadopoulos & sons but divest the food manufacturing side of the business.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{divest the food manufacturing? what else is there?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{sell off the food but keep the property.}
<C>__{lars}
<D>__{papadopoulos plaza. it's going to be worth a fortune.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's not what i had in mind.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{it's an asset breakup.}
<C>__{lars}
<D>__{tusk. tusk, yah? makes us sound like barbarians.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{with the new loan, you'd buy back your old assets and then sell off the brands in the pap & sons stable.}
<C>__{lars}
<D>__{yah. and you know how to squeeze the value harry.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{that's a break up.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{please. i know what it is.}
<C>__{lars}
<D>__{the pitta bread, the cakes get sold to a bakery.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{the halloumi and feta to a dairy company.}
<C>__{lars}
<D>__{i love your halloumi! grilled. it's...}
<P>__{(kisses air)}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{the sell off value of these brands will exceed the new loan.}
<C>__{lars}
<D>__{so my bank will get its money back faster than you can say 'knife'.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and what do you get?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{lars wants 50% of the plaza development. which is what will remain after the debts have been settled.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{so you get 50% of the development for free.}
<C>__{lars}
<D>__{sure, yeah. but you get 50% of the same development yah, also for free.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{what do you want harry?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i want my food business back.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{guy, guys, guys. reality check. harry. it's not going to happen. okay? the best you can hope for is to work with lars here and save something.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i can't say no.}
<C>__{lars}
<D>__{okay. so. yah. i need to take this to the board. take two, three months. but pish, yah?}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{it seems criminal to buy the business back only to break it up.}
<A>__{as an aside to sophie.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{can i just point out that you are skating. figuratively speaking. on thin fucking ice.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i will do whatever the bank wants.}
<C>__{lars}
<D>__{okay! harry, we are going to take this to the hoop, yah? three points! yah? three points!}
