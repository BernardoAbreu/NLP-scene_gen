<L>__{interior bar the kid}
<A>__{he is drinking a bottle of beer slowly. camera pans to another bar stool where a customer is having his shoes shined by a negro boy who slaps his rag against the shoes with a fine sense of rhythm. finished, he collects his dime and nickel tip, and moves to the kid.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{shine them up for you sir?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{no, thanks.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{fetch you a newspaper maybe?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{how about a singy song then? i play good.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{play what?}
<A>__{the boy takes out a tobacco can with the lid torn off and the top flattened down and shakes it, producing a sound like the rustle of dry leaves. then he produces a similar can that makes a rattling noise when he shakes it.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{dry corn in this one. blue shale stone from the river in this one. you ready?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{yes, i'm ready.}
<A>__{the boy looks at the bartender, who has moved closer to see what's going on.}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(to bartender)}
<D>__{you ready?}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{hell, i'm ready for anything.}
<A>__{the boy stands perfectly still for a few seconds, then begins to shake the can with corn in it. after a bit he brings in the shale stone can with the other hand to chord and accent the rustle of the first can. at the same time he begins to sing a simple song in a pure, delicate voice. it is catfish music created on the spot and sounds strangely like the idle tunes christian likes to hum.}
<C>__{kid}
<P>__{(when the song is over)}
<D>__{thank you very much. that was nice. where did you learn to do that?}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{i picked it up from herman.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{who is herman?}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{my friend i pick it up from.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{is he a good friend?}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{i don't know 'bout that suh. he just a frien' who teach me some things.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{well, i don't want a shine, but here's fifteen cents.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{and here's another dime for you, fella.}
<A>__{he rings up a no sale and flips a dime to the boy, who is astonished and then worried by this munificence. suddenly he grabs his tobacco cans and his shoe shine kit, and runs out into the street.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{nice little colored kid.}
<C>__{kid}
<P>__{(mostly to himself)}
<D>__{ yeah.}
<A>__{(time lapse)}
