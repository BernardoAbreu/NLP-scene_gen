<A>__{we see taylor walking up the steps and through the massive front door.}
<L>__{interior cleveland library day}
<A>__{we pick up taylor making his way past the circulation desk. he glances around and finds what he's looking for: lynn, talking to one of the reference librarians. she finishes her conversation and turns, to find herself face to face with taylor. she's wearing her tortoise shell glasses.}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(hushed)}
<D>__{jake, you shouldn't have come here.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i was wonderin' why you'd give an old friend a bum phone number.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{let's talk in my office, okay?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i don't wanna talk in your office.}
<A>__{lynn starts to walk. we'll follow them as they make their way through the library. lynn tries to keep the conversation hushed. taylor could give a shit.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i told you i don't think it's a good idea for us to see each other.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{we don't have anything in common. sometimes i wonder if we ever did.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{what are you talkin' about? we were both athletes, world class, hot for each other. what more can you have in common?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i stopped bein' an athlete three years ago. books are my life now.}
<A>__{jake suppresses a smile.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{don't you dare laugh, jake. in two years i've put together one of the best special collections departments in the country.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{so what is it? you're still sore i never read moby dick?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you never read anything i asked you to.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{not like what's his name at the restaurant?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{his name is tom, and keep your voice down.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{what do ya see in this guy?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{he's stable. he's intelligent... and i've never found him in bed with a stewardess.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{that's 'cause no stewardess would have him. wouldn't you rather be with somebody who's in demand?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{just like always, you don't take anything seriously. everything's a joke to you.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{c'mon, lynn, for christ sake, i'm just tryin' to loosen things up a little. i'm gettin' frostbite here.}
<A>__{lynn stops and turns to face him.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{tom and i are getting married in the fall.}
<A>__{taylor is momentarily floored by the revelation.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{what? that's crazy, lynn. i got plans for us.}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(walking again)}
<D>__{what plans?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i was gonna play another a year or two, then we go to hawaii, and have a couple kids who grow up to be olympic champions.}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(stopping again)}
<D>__{how can you think stuff like that? i haven't seen you in two years. you never even wrote me a letter.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i'm sorry, lynn, but i wasn't exactly proud of my situation. c'mon, you didn't think about me at all since i been gone?}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(walking again)}
<D>__{not so loud, jake.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{remember the three nights we spent on the beach in vera cruz? you have nights like that with mr. briefcase?}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(stopping again)}
<D>__{what about the night you had in detroit with miss dairy queen?}
<A>__{they're in the large reading room now.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{what was i supposed to do? she bet me fifty bucks she had a better body than you. i had to defend your honor.}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(whirling on him and exploding)}
<D>__{what a bunch of bullshit!}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{i have a much better body than she does.}
<A>__{with this the whole reading room turns around and stares at her. lynn is mortified by her outburst. taylor tries to smooth it over.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(addressing the library patrons)}
<D>__{she's right. take it from me, she really does. i mean miss dairy queen has quantity, i give her that, but the, ah, quality just isn't there.}
<A>__{nice job, jake. lynn is still mortified.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{how many think lynn oughta give me another shot?}
<A>__{most of the hands in the room shoot up.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{the ayes have it.}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(walking off again)}
<D>__{you haven't changed at all, have you?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i'm afraid i have or i wouldn't be here. c'mon, lynn, i don't wanna do time for things that happened years ago.}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(turning back to him)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, jake. you'll always be the little boy who wouldn't grow up.}
<A>__{lynn starts off for her office door.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{lynn, wait...}
<A>__{lynn continues on into her office. as the door closes, we go to taylor's forlorn face.}
