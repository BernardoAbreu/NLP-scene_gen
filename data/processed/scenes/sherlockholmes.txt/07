<L>__{interior cathedral crypts entrance night}
<A>__{holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a stairwell. he takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but not as fit as he used to be. holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral staircase beyond it. he stops at the doorway and peers round the corner. a lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards holmes. holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the door. a bowler hatted man ascends the stairs, carrying the lantern and a gun. he peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the shadows, but does not see holmes, who has pulled his black jacket up to conceal his face. the man swings the lantern away again. he peers about, confused. we see holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his jacket and thinks through his plan of attack.}
<C>__{holmes }
<D>__{head cocked to the left, partial deafness in right ear. first point of attack.}
<A>__{pre visualization in vari speed focus on the spot behind the man's right ear, just at the top of the jaw the most vulnerable pointerior holmes launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400 fps (ultra slow motion) as he makes contact. the man's head is thrown back as he spins round.}
<C>__{holmes }
<D>__{then throat, paralyze vocal chords, stop screaming.}
<A>__{back to 24 fps. the man's mouth opens to cry out. we ramp back up to 400 fps as his adam's apple is struck with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream.}
<C>__{holmes }
<D>__{stink of alcohol, heavy drinker knuckles to liver.}
<A>__{back to 24 fps, ramping to 400 fps as a devastating knuckle punch to the liver doubles up the bowler hatted thug and crumples him to his knees. second time action super fast repeat of above holmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we can barely see what he's doing. thwack! hammer blow to ear. crack! karate chop to throat. whap! knuckle punch to liver. back to normal motion as the man crumples to the ground, holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it onto his own in one super fast move. holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase. pov bottom of the spiral staircase another bowler hatted thug approaches the bottom of the staircase. he has seen the lantern light. he draws his gun and approaches. holmes places the lantern on the post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the shadows.}
<C>__{thug}
<D>__{what's goin' on, john?}
<A>__{when he gets no answer, the thug points his gun to where we saw holmes hide. but holmes appears from the shadows behind the thug, reaches around him, grabs his gun hand and pistol whips him twice with his own gun, dropping him. holmes extracts a cigar from the thug's top pocket and sniffs it appreciatively.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{hhhmm, good cigar. who do you work for?}
<A>__{he jams the cigar in his own top pocket, picks up the man's bowler and proceeds on, further down into the crypts.}
