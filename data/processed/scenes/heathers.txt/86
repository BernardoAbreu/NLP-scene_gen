<L>__{exterior the front of the school day}
<A>__{veronica wearily pushes open the front door and emerges outside of the school. she closes her eyes to therapeutically bask in the sun's rays. a slight smile trembles onto her face. a strange voice kills it.}
<C>__{j.d. }
<D>__{color me impressed.}
<A>__{j.d. stands starkly in the distance before her, blood spurting from his throat onto his gunslinger coat. he painfully speaks through his assasinated vocal cords.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you really fucked me up, veronica.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(vertigo city)}
<D>__{i thought i...you..}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you've got power, veronica. power i didn't think you had. the slate is clean.}
<A>__{j.d. pulls open his coat revealing that the bomb is attached to his torso. the green light is on and the clock says 00:10..00:09.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{pretend i did blow up the school. all the schools. now that you're dead, what are you gonna do with your life?}
<A>__{veronica takes the unlit cigrette from her blazer pocket and puts it in her mouth. she then folsd her arms.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{perfecto.}
<A>__{j.d. raises his arms in a crucifixion pose as the bomb clicks to 0:00. nothing happens. an annoyed j.d. breaks out of his crucifixion stance and raps the bomb with his palm.}
<B>__{the pep assembly}
<A>__{the sound of the bomb explosion plunges the cheering up and down pep assembly into chaos. wailing students pour out of the bleachers screaming less out of fear than a "whoa dude" sense of excitement.}
<B>__{the front of the school}
<A>__{veronica stands in the same position in front of the school with her arms still folded. only now her cigarette is lit and her face and clothes are blackened in ash. flames flicker in bushes behind her. veronica drags on the cigarette and turns to go inside.}
