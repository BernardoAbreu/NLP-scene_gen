<T>__{smash cut :}
<A>__{to real time applause as buddy reaches the end of the song. larry is the only one not clapping. rack across to shelly as he picks up on this.}
<L>__{interior paradise lounge back stage night}
<A>__{shelly approaches buddy's dressing room. he enters without knocking...}
<L>__{interior buddy stafford's dressing room night}
<A>__{...to find a trembling buddy hunched over on a sofa, hugging himself. buddy immediately sits up...}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{shelly. i was a goddamn embarrassment tonight. i shouldn'a let you talk me into going on.}
<P>__{(massages his throat)}
<D>__{it's definitely strep.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{you were velvet out there, pops. silk.}
<A>__{shelly throws a pair of red silk panties to buddy. we see a room number scribbled on the crotch area.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{they were hanging on the door outside. forget your tonsils. when the muff confetti stops coming, that's when you got yourself a problem.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(dangling the panties on his finger)}
<D>__{you get a receipt?}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{charmayne's in the lobby. they got these on sale in the window. victoria secret's valentine's collection. and the broad waiting in the room, what she set you back? always grade a for ol' buddy.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{are you kidding me? gimme that.}
<P>__{(snatches the panties away from buddy)}
<D>__{you don't fucking deserve this. all those ladies going home with a sweet breeze between their legs because you still do it for them and you're fingering me for some kinda buddy stafford ego pimp. hey, fuck you, old man.}
<A>__{shelly feigns as if he's leaving.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(affectionately)}
<D>__{get back here, you prick. hand it over.}
<A>__{shelly throws the panties back at buddy. buddy just stares at him with pained eyes, waiting for something else. sweat mirror balls his wrinkled forehead. shelly nods. removes a foil package from his pocket. hands it to buddy. the singer rushes over to his dressing table. unwraps his works. rubber tubes his forearm. trembling hands juggle lighter and hypodermic. shelly takes a seat on the sofa. buddy, euphoric as the dope hits the spot. tears in his eyes. he picks up on shelly's somber expression in the mirror.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{whassimatter, kid? you got that nostradamus look.}
<A>__{shelly shakes his head.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{you ever watch those nature shows on tv?}
<A>__{shelly shakes his head.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{i've seen this one a dozen times. it's about lions. cycle of life thing. the leader of the pack...}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{pride. it's called a pride.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{yeah, pride. the leader of the pride... when he gets on in years. it's just a matter of time before some young male arrives on the scene to challenge him. they go at it and the old cat gets the crap beaten outta him. it's humiliating. in front of all the females, this goes down. and after he's defeated, he's cast out of the pride, to scavenge and die alone in the bush.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{yeah, nature's got a real sick sense of humor.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{no shit. it's fucking tragic because the old lion can't figure it out on his own. that he's past it. it'd be so much easier for him to just walk away and save himself all that pain and humiliation.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{that's like admitting to yourself that you're already dead. i prefer nature's way.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{yeah. me, too.}
<A>__{shelly holds buddy's gaze in the mirror.}
