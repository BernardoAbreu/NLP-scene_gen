<A>__{past other patients, doctors, etc. we see some of this from her point of view. she goes through two swinging doors, down another hall... at the end of which a man opens a door. she is pushed onto a:}
<B>__{stage}
<A>__{she is wheeled into a row... between two other patients. in the background we hear a voice:}
<C>__{dr. harlington }
<D>__{one merely inserts the leucotome beneath the eyelid and presses up into the prefrontal lobe, manipulating it so as to sever the nervous connections between the thalamofrontal radiation and the body of the brain.}
<A>__{the lights are bright, on her and the other patients. we cannot see, but we sense, an audience watching.}
<C>__{dr. harlington }
<D>__{because of the speed and simplicity of the operation, i am able, as you are seeing, to perform the procedure on ten patients in less than a half hour.}
<A>__{frances stares up at a fan in the ceiling. it's moving round and round. the voice drones on.}
<C>__{dr. harlington }
<D>__{the operation is completely painless and can be performed without any sedative whatsoever.}
<A>__{we now see vaguely that dr. harlington has moved to the patient on the adjacent gurney.}
<C>__{dr. harlington}
<D>__{we have always known that this form of radical treatment was effective, but until now it couldn't be applied on a large scale. the old procedure required a full day's work by a surgical team to perform a single operation. in the same time, working alone, i can treat fifty.}
<A>__{frances turns and stares mutely, without emotion, at what's happening next to her: the leucotome (an ice pick like instrument) is inserted into a woman's eye socket...}
<C>__{dr. harlington}
<D>__{this procedure works best on patients with extreme over reactions to emotional stimuli. it can also be used as a last resort on those who seem impervious to other forms of treatment.}
<A>__{the leucotome is then shoved up into the brain and twisted.}
<C>__{dr. harlington}
<D>__{in plain language, my technique severs the nerves which give emotional energy to ideas. along with the cure comes a loss of affect... a kind of emotional flattening...}
<A>__{frances turns away and stares at the fan again. there is something simple and pleasing about its rhythmic whirring...}
<C>__{dr. harlington}
<D>__{...with diminished creativity and imagination. patients become like good solid cake with no icing. but, after all, it is their emotions and imaginations that are disturbed.}
<A>__{we glimpse the leucotome being withdrawn.}
<C>__{dr. harlington}
<D>__{these patients will soon be leaving the hospital.}
<A>__{harlington's face moves vaguely into frances' view.}
<C>__{dr. harlington}
<D>__{lobotomy gets 'em home.}
