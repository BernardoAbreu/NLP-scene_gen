<L>__{interior alleyway night}
<A>__{hunkered on the pavement, they watch the car glide past the mouth of the alley. vicki sighs in relief. batman still alert, his muscles tensed puts a restraining hand on her arm. he looks overhead, sees a catwalk spanning the width of the alleyway five stories up.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{how much do you weigh?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{... a hundred and eight?}
<A>__{he does some quick mental calculations. a beat. then the car reappears backing up blocking their only avenue of escape. batman unfurls a rope, heaves a batarang upward, and grabs vicki roughly about the waist.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{hang on!}
<A>__{the joker's thugs pile out of the car. the batarang catches on the catwalk, and batman triggers the spring action reel on his utility belt jerking him and vicki into the air. bullets zing past as they whip upward like fish on a line. one story; two stories; and then... they slow. they stop. they dangle in midair as the joker's goons advance. batman wriggles, twists. they lurch upward another few feet and stop again. vicki screams. her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism. they're stranded two stories up sitting ducks.}
<C>__{batman }
<D>__{whatever happens don't let go!!}
<A>__{in the wink of an eye he's detached the reel from his own waist and hitched it around vicki's belt. before she has a chance to protest, he lets go. vicki rockets upward at blinding speed, shrieking all the way. batman, his cape billowing, plummets downward. vicki slams up into the catwalk and bobs on the end of the line as batman lands with a loud crash, overturning a row of garbage cans. the goons are on him in a flash one per limb. random kicking and flailing. batman manages to slam two goons into a wall, but before he can get to his feet goon #3 slams a lead pipe into the back of his skull. batman is down for the count. the thugs dust themselves off and circle around his prostrate form, still wary. the lead thug holds his colleagues back, draws his gun, and fires two shots, point blank, at the yellow and black insigne on batman's chest. the body jerks. they move closer. and stop.}
<C>__{goon i}
<D>__{... no blood.}
<C>__{goon ii}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{goon iii}
<D>__{wait a minute.}
<A>__{goon iii screws up his courage and crouches beside the body. he examines the batman's tunic... and rips it open.}
<C>__{goon iv}
<D>__{... what is that?}
<C>__{goon iii}
<D>__{some kind of body armor.}
<C>__{goon i}
<D>__{he's human after all. take that mask off.}
