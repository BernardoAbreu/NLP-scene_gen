<L>__{interior barn}
<A>__{doc pulls the ford to a stop just within the double doors. he passes rudy, leaving a clear exit pathway for the getaway station wagon. doc jumps out of the ford as soon as the ignition switch is cut; carol a beat behind him on the opposite side. rudy moves into the archway created by the barn's open doors. he stands almost in silhouette as the bright sunlight breaks around him. doc snaps open the door of the car, his back turned to rudy. he reaches into the back seat and grasps the black suitcase, not by the middle handle but by each end, as if it contained a great weight.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(speaking over his shoulder, not looking at rudy)}
<D>__{where's jackson?}
<A>__{rudy withdraws the pistol from under his raincoat.}
<C>__{rudy}
<P>__{(pointing his gun lazily at doc, supremely confident)}
<D>__{he didn't make it, doc... you didn't either.}
<A>__{doc straightens, still holding the suitcase. he starts to turn to rudy, eyes wide, helpless. carol fumbles for the gun in her purse. rudy extends his arm, ready to begin the execution. doc swings the suitcase around slowly, seemingly ready to face rudy's bullets... then he shoots rudy in the middle of the chest, doc's .45 slug driving him backward. doc has concealed the pistol in his hand with the satchel. he drops the suitcase with his first shot, fires again, blasting rudy in the middle. two large holes now show at the chest of rudy's raincoat. rudy is knocked back over the hillock, tumbling down the precipice and into a grassy meadow below. doc stands at the crest of the hill. he looks down as rudy's body stops turning. doc shifts the .45 to his right hand. rudy's body lies still. doc turns quickly away prom the hilltop, not giving rudy's body a second glance. carol, gun in hand, stands outside the barn, transfixed.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{how did you know?}
<A>__{doc doesn't answer, motioning her into the car... the getaway car... as she starts to change clothes... he reloads. doc takes a long look at carol.}
<B>__{they get in the car and leave.}
