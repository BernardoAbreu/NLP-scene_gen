<A>__{eduardo enters a dimly lit room. gru sneaks behind and peers through a crack in the door.}
<L>__{int: secret mayan room continuous}
<A>__{eduardo stands in the center of a secret room, which is lined with mayan style totem poles. he dances on the tile floor, which lights up and plays "la cucaracha" with each strategic step. the musical pattern is a code which opens a secret passageway through the largest totem's mouth. eduardo enters and the mouth closes behind him. gru tentatively enters the room. he pauses at the tile floor. he tries to replicate eduardo's "la cucaracha" code, but a glob of guacamole from his sombrero falls to the floor and hits the wrong tile. this activates a booby trapped totem pole, which halves gru's sombrero with a spear.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{what the oh!}
<A>__{gru observes the destroyed sombrero in his hands.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{huh.}
<A>__{gru attempts the code again, but missteps. an axe from the wall swings at him and misses.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{oooh!}
<A>__{gru missteps again and one of the totems lights up and spits fire at him, burning his face.}
<C>__{gru }
<P>__{(dazed)}
<D>__{aaaahhh...}
<A>__{he missteps again and a club whacks him over the head.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{one of the totems shoots darts at him, piercing his nose.}
<C>__{gru }
<P>__{(in pain)}
<D>__{aaaahhh!}
<A>__{gru falls to the floor.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{oooohhh.}
<A>__{his head hits the correct tile, and the mayan passageway opens. gru walks to the door, pointing at the totems and gloating.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{aha! ha ha ha }
<A>__{the passageway doors slam on his arm.}
<C>__{gru }
<P>__{(in pain)}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{he pulls his crushed arm through the doors.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{ouch!}
