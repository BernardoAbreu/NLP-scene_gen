<L>__{interior apartment building (new york), hallway night}
<A>__{angle on apartment doorway. as it opens and an enormously sweet faced, elder woman steps out, bungled up against the cold turning back to call inside to the unseen love of her long life.}
<D>__{sweet faced woman i'm just going to get some flowers, dear. i will be back in twenty minutes. it's tulip season today. i'm so happy.}
<A>__{and now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness dissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that quickly she has reversed herself and re entered her apartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated. pov melvin udall in the hallway... well past 50... unliked, unloved, unsettling. a huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever met. right now all his considerable talent and strength is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the elevator door he holds open.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{come here, sweetheart... come on.}
<B>__{on dog}
<A>__{sniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting. melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the mutt who has ignores him.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{wanna go for a ride? okay, sweetie?}
<A>__{the dog lifts his leg at the precise moment melvin lunges and picks him up with a decisive heft so that dog urine squirts the hall wall for a second or two. the dog sensing a kindred spirit starts to growl and bark.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(a malevolent tone)}
<D>__{you've pissed your last floor, you dog eared monkey.}
<A>__{the dog takes a snap at melvin, but the man is much meaner and quicker than the dog he holds his snout shut with his hand and reaches for the door of the garbage chute.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i will bet you wish you were some sort of real dog now, huh? don't worry... this is new york. if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere, you know? you ugly, smelly fuck.}
<A>__{and with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and lets go. we hear a fading series of pleading "anoooos" from the dog fade to nothingness... as another apartment door opens emitting the loud sounds of a party and simon nye, early 30s. simon has been born and raised with gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man.}
<L>__{interior apartment building (new york), hallway night}
<A>__{frantic... he bolts into the hall... melvin is just about to enter his apartment.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{verdell!?!! here, good doggie...}

<P>__{(as melvin turns)}
<D>__{have you seen verdell?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{what's he look like?}
<A>__{melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is directly opposite simon's.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{my dog... you know... i mean my little dog with the adorable face... don't you know what my dog looks like?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i got it. you're talking about your dog. i thought that was the name of the colored man i've been seeing in the hall.}
<A>__{simon looks o.s. and sees his black friend.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{which color was that?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...}
<A>__{simon has had it.}

<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{simon, you've got to get dressed.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(to simon)}
<D>__{what i know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, i don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. are we being neighbors for now?}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{do you still think i was exaggerating?}
<A>__{frank can only smile.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{hope you find him. i love that dog.}
<A>__{simon, terminally non confrontational, still finds himself compelled to turn back toward melvin.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(directly)}
<D>__{you don't love anything, mr. udall.}
<A>__{simon closes his door leaving melvin alone in the hallway.}

<D>__{thank the good lord... wow... my honey... where have you been?}
<C>__{party goer}
<P>__{(thinking the greeting's for him)}
<D>__{he always liked me.}
<A>__{as simon goes past him to take the dog from the handyman... jackie, frank's junior partner, barking a laugh at the party goer verdell barking some love. as the others greet simon, jackie directs the group inside. jackie lingers, looking on affectionately as simon picks some awful, sticky gunk from the dog's body... he puts verdell down to reach for his wallet the tiny dog yaps in protest.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{just for a second, okay?}
<A>__{the dog yaps "no." simon, delighted, picks him up again.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(kissing him on the mouth)}
<D>__{look at him... where was little baby?}
<C>__{handyman}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{in the basement garbage bin eating diaper shit.}
<A>__{simon reacts then notices the handyman, tongue in cheek, trying to suppress his amusement.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{go ahead, john, you earned your fun.}
<P>__{(looking at verdell)}
<D>__{how did he get down in the basement? i mean even if he got on the elevator how... ?}

<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{well, that's a load off.}
<A>__{melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to close the door when simon has another burst of bravery.}

<D>__{did you... do something to him?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{do you realize that i work at him?}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(eyes downcast)}

<D>__{no... actually, i even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{well, i work all the time. so never, never again interrupt me. okay? i mean, never. not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge packer you dated has been elected the first queer president of the united states... and he's going to put you up in camp david and you just want to share the moment with someone... don't knock ... not on this door. not for anything. got me. sweetheart?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{yes. it's not a subtle point you're making.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{okay, then.}
<A>__{melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{so the theory of confrontations is that now he'll think twice before messing with me?}

<C>__{simon}
<D>__{he's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{won't worry about it. you go ahead.}
<A>__{frank waits till simon exits scene and then knocks loudly on melvin's door. there is a sharp change in his demeanor.}
<C>__{melvin }
<D>__{oh, i'm pissed!! now i am really pissed!!!}
<A>__{frank waits patiently as melvin jerks his door back open. frank immediately grabs melvin by his shirt and jerks him forward... melvin is scared. operating on survival mode.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{no touch. no touch. no touch.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but i grew up in hell. my grandmother had more attitude. you don't intimidate me.}

<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{assault and battery and you're black.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{shhhh now. i like simon. i like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. meanwhile, i will try and think how you can make this up to him.}
<P>__{(suddenly loud)}
<D>__{i hate doing this. i'm an art dealer.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{have a nice day. party!}
<A>__{he tosses melvin back and walks out. melvin straightens his shirt as he steps out into the hall. frank smiles as he re enters the other apartment. melvin appears impressed.}
<L>__{exterior new york city street near carol's restaurant day}
<A>__{a crowded and dirty street and here comes melvin. his walk is brisk an animal wanting to pass through the danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear. at times he places his palms together and extends his arms cutting a path through people. we will be very pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks.}

<A>__{carol connelly talks with another mother a customer. you would not guess it, but her working hours tend to be the most carefree time of the day. she is telling a story about her son for the umpteenth time.}

<D>__{you know all my son's stuff, right?}
<A>__{the mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but carol interrupts her.}
<C>__{carol}

<D>__{little blonde angle.}
<P>__{(to child, affectionately)}
<D>__{eat everything.}
<A>__{melvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a table towards the back and is obviously surprised to find a man and woman sitting at the table.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{it just came out of me. i said you love me the way a remote control loves a tv. as long as i switch every time...}
<C>__{her male companion}

<D>__{pay me back next week.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i owe you. i told you today... them's the rules. oh, excuse me, melvin.}
<A>__{she puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out of the way. he gulps at the contact (since no one else ever touches him) but covers his self consciousness.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i'm starving.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(firmly to lisa)}
<D>__{will you please take it?}
<A>__{melvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with stealth, so that she must touch him again to get him out of the way...}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{this way you take a cab home so you have time to get ready for the date.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{"ready" is not my problem.}
<A>__{she barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. if we could read melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the date talk. to carol he is as harmless as furniture.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(to melvin)}
<D>__{go sit down. you know you're not allowed back here... spencer's more excited about it than i am... he says, "mom, i promise not to get a fever or couch during your date."}
<A>__{the other waitresses and the short order cook all go "awww."}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i know. he's just the best.}

<D>__{or you can just wait your turn...}
<A>__{melvin walks back into the restaurant proper... he hangs near their table... his discomfort builds in this limbo... then:}

<D>__{how much more you got to eat? your appetite isn't as big as your noses, is it?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what?!!}

<D>__{let's go }
<A>__{the woman starts to protest.}

<D>__{let's leave. we're going.}
<A>__{melvin sits down at the table and takes from his pocket a plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed. as he opens his utensils.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{bryan says he doesn't care how long you've been coming you ever act like this again you're barred for life. i'm gonna miss the excitement, but i will handle it.}
<A>__{there is in carol's attitude toward melvin some ingredient of self satisfaction that she is the only one in the place who can handle him. she starts to clear the table.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{the table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{you're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{we're all gonna die soon. i will. you will. it sure sounds like your son will.}
<B>__{on carol}
<A>__{stunned. some crazy street freak has slipped under her perfect guard and momentarily devastated her. melvin senses that he's gone way too far. he wipes his knife.}

<A>__{a beat and then melvin nods, hardly breathing backing down.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{okay. i will get your order.}

<L>__{interior carol's apartment night}
<A>__{she is underneath a younger, cuter man on the living room sofa. he is expertly into foreplay. she begins to make noises as she responds... each time startling herself with her own noise and trying to reign it in. she's two women here one speeding the pleasure highway the other functional mom so blown away by the emergence of this sexy self that she laughs. the young man stops and looks at her.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i... i... i don't know... you got me.}
<A>__{his eyes try to burn into hers... she is getting excited but doesn't know how to play it... he pushes one of the fingers of the hand caressing her face toward her mouth... she closes her teeth, his fingers attempt opening her mouth. she stops him.}

<D>__{let me just do whatever i do by myself... i will catch up to you someplace i promise.}
<P>__{(as he's put off)}
<D>__{oh, no... don't look like that. no. i'm sorry if i'm a goof.}
<A>__{and so with earnestness and caring, she has transformed the sex into something more intimate and, talk about egg in your beer, hotter. things are getting wild when we hear from the distance a child, spencer, calling and}

<C>__{carol}
<D>__{kissing... kissing boys. oh my.}

<A>__{pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway... she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her mother, beverly, is listening to music on headphones... she takes them off when she sees carol, then hears the cough.}

<C>__{spencer}

<C>__{carol}
<D>__{don't be silly. how bad?}
<C>__{spencer}
<D>__{not bad.}
<A>__{carol feels his head... that's okay. then he coughs trying to suppress it... then a bigger cough... they each know what that signals... she brings up a waste basket as he throws up... she comforts him. he apologizes. she loves him.}

<D>__{oh, god... i don't even notice anymore.}
