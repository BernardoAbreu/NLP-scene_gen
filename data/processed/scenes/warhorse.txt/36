<T>__{nicholls interjects:}
<C>__{captain nicholls}
<D>__{i don't doubt your qualifications, albert, but the law is very clear about the proper age for soldiering, and your father's done what he had to do. you know that. thirty guineas isn't nearly enough to purchase a horse as fine as your joey, i know that. but it's all i've got. will you lease him to me, albert, to be my own mount?}
<P>__{(he removes his cap, earnest)}
<D>__{i promise you, man to man, that i will look after him as closely as you've done, i will respect him and all the care that you've taken with him. and if i can i will return him to your care.}
<A>__{albert looks at him. although nicholls speaks with authority he has a kindness which albert recognizes.}
<C>__{captain nicholls }
<D>__{now say goodbye.}
<A>__{albert kisses joey.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{it's all right, boy...}
<A>__{but at that moment, sam perkins pulls joey away:}
<C>__{sam perkins}
<D>__{all right, turn it in, eh? that's enough. he's a horse, not a dog. now, on your way.}
<P>__{(to joey)}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{nicholls walks away into the crowd. the sergeant pulls joey, but joey does not want to be separated from albert. his reaction is implacable, reminiscent to the separation from his mother. perkins leads joey away. they disappear into the crowd and rosie is suddenly there. ted senses her silent judgment.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{do you want to lose the farm, rose?}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{it's the way you did it.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{but we're at war.}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{aren't we just.}
<A>__{she looks at albert. implacable. forever.}
