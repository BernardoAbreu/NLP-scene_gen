<A>__{tim talks on his cell as he drives.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{well, i think everything's ok. hope it is anyway. listen kurt, here's why i'm calling...}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior sunset terrace ballroom later that morning}
<A>__{an eagle soars on a large video screen. a patriotic anthem plays. we boom down from the screen to find ronald. he's on stage finishing up his two diamond presentation.}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{people sometimes say that promises are cheap. you know what ronald wilkes says to that? n s f. not so fast. at the end of the day, a man's word is a sacred creed. and the word i give you at ronald wilkes insurance is i will work for you. thank you.}
<A>__{the words, "ronald wilkes insurance: working for you" appear on screen. ronald's face dissolves over the eagle. the crowd goes nuts, applauding wildly. dean and joan start a standing ovation. ronald, though exhausted, beams on stage. tim is nowhere to be found. an executive council member addresses the crowd.}
<C>__{executive council member}
<D>__{once again folks, president helgesson left a note under my door this morning saying he had to leave asmi early due to a family emergency. i haven't been able to reach him on his mobile, but obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to orin and his family.}
<C>__{executive council member }
<P>__{(a moment of silence)}
<D>__{now... we're set to hear our final two diamond presenter. tim lip from northlands insurance. tim?}
<A>__{joan, dean and ronald exchange worried looks. dean stands.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{hey travis, i don't think tim...}
<A>__{just then, tim appears. he is filthy covered in mud, sweat, hog shit and tears. he futilely smooths his hair and tries to tuck in his shirt as he takes the stage to sparse applause. tim goes to the computer set up on stage for power pointerior he puts in his disc. his presentation appears on the screen.}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(severely coughs)}
<D>__{thank you. i'm tim lippe. hog farm risk mitigation... what is...?}
<A>__{tim knocks a folder off the podium. papers fly everywhere.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{smooth move, ex lax.}
<P>__{(a few chuckles)}
<D>__{so, hog... no. i, ah... this girl i met, sorry woman, i guess. she's}
<A>__{she takes drugs, and i think}
<D>__{might be some kind of prostitute.}
<P>__{(a collective gasp)}
<D>__{but she's super insightful. y'know what she said to me last night? said the only real insurance is love. that's fricking intense, isn't it...?}
<A>__{awkward murmurs. at this moment, a very pleased bill krogstad walks in with mike pyle. krogstad tenses, however, when he sees tim's state.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{i'm... ah... our only true safety net. love. crazy. i believe in insurance. i believe in love...}
<A>__{tim laughs. he looks up and sees bill.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{bill! bill krogstad. my former boss, everybody.}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<P>__{(jaw clenched smile)}
<D>__{what're you doing, lippe?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{why'd you do this, bill? i don't understand.}
<A>__{krogstad chuckles, preferring to avoid any public drama.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{why'd you do it, bill? why'd you do it? why'd you lie, bill?}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<P>__{(to the audience)}
<D>__{sorry, folks. guess it's against the law now for a business owner to sell his own business. must've missed that constitutional amendment.}
<A>__{this draws chuckles from the crowd.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{insurance isn't just a business, bill. insurance is personal. i've got some savings. i could've gotten a loan. we could've worked something out.}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<P>__{(still playing to the crowd)}
<D>__{yeah, there's a guy you want running an agency, isn't it?}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{come on, tim, you're tired. you're looking foolish here. you couldn't run an agency if your life depended on it.}
<A>__{tim's lip starts to quiver, and with great effort:}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{screw you, bill. screw you... hard.}
<P>__{(gathers strength)}
<D>__{that's a bunch of dog crap. you and lemke, that... fucking pervert... you stole my ideas and called them your own for years. and i didn't say squat because i figured we were like a family. i may not have quite as many clients as roger had. but my people are loyal, bill.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{i care about them. and guess what, they care about me. fact, i've called more than half of them already this morning...}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<D>__{watch yourself, lippe...}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i knew which ones would be on their way to church, which ones i'd be waking up, which ones probably got a little blotto last night and might be hung over... and every single person i talked to every one is staying with me.}
<C>__{bill krogstad}
<D>__{you don't know what you're doing.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i do actually. i do know, bill. and before the day is out, i will have called all my clients. all of them.}
<P>__{(to mike pyle)}
<D>__{so hey, congratulations pyle of shit you just bought a company that's losing half its business.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{fuck yeah timbo!}
<A>__{mike pyle blinks several times. krogstad seethes. before tim can fully bask in the glow of his triumph:}
<C>__{orin }
<D>__{right there, officer. that's him.}
<A>__{orin, still in his pajamas and caked in hog shit, points two cedar rapids cops in tim's direction. tactful pandemonium ensues. dean, ronald and joan rush to tim's side.}
<C>__{joan ronald}
<A>__{jesus lippe, what did you do? aw jeez. this is no good.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{what's the fucking charge?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{before the cops get to him, tim hands dean a crumpled piece of paper.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{you'll figure it out.}
<A>__{a cop cuffs tim and leads him out of the ballroom.}
