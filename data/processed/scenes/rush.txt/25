<A>__{niki sits with louis stanley in an airport cafe. contracts are open on the table. niki is signing. louis stanley is counter signing...}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{in return for your money you get a car, mechanics and a place on the team. plus fifty per cent of starting fees and bonuses for podium finishes.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{who's the number one driver?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{clay regazzoni and you will defer to him at all times.}
<A>__{niki takes out his cheque book and pen. he looks up...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{why would i defer to him if i am paying his wages?}
<A>__{niki writes the cheque. stanley's smile fades..}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{because he's a proven winner at the highest level, a good guy, and someone who quite frankly, could teach you a thing or two.}
<A>__{niki ignores this, continues scrutinizing the contract...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{ok. there is one clause missing.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{the one about mechanics' exclusivity? sorry. we have a cardinal rule at brm. all information is shared between all our drivers..}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{and i made it perfectly clear that my mechanics work for me. no one else. this is something i cannot sign.}
<A>__{niki takes back the cheque. stanley stares...}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{all right. i will have the lawyers amend it.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{while you're at it you can tell them to amend the clause for podium finishes. podium is first three places, not just wins.}
<A>__{niki puts the cheque in his attache case. snaps it shut, taking it with him..}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{you'll get the money on signature, as agreed. see you at winter testing.}
<A>__{niki gets to his feet, and leaves. stanley watches the attache case disappear.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{if that little git drives half as well as he negotiates, we're going to be fine.}
