<A>__{jo looks towards ben helplessly. mrs. drayton is between the two of them and any possible exit. ben immediately eases his way along behind a column which hides him somewhat from the front, but not from the side. jo endeavors to shrink her body behind a tall woman in front of her, but she is not entirely successful. we can see mrs. drayton getting closer to them. jo looks toward ben almost panicked. suddenly mrs. drayton has reached the end of their row. she pushes forward her collection plate, and as she does so her face blanches. she instantly identifies the two. ben, with little else to do, looks her straight in the eye and puts some coins into her plate.}
