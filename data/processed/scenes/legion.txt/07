<L>__{exterior gun & sport world continuous}
<A>__{michael, bulging rifle bags in each hand, stepping brazenly out of the gaping hole he's blown in the front of the store.}
<C>__{estevez }
<D>__{freeze!}
<A>__{estevez and burton are already out of the squad car, crouching behind the open doors, guns trained on michael.}
<C>__{estevez}
<D>__{drop the bags! hands on your head!}
<A>__{in the distance, the pop pop of gunfire. the police radio crackles with urgent chatter. many voices talking at once. "shots fired...code three...officer down!" the cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(sensing their unease:)}
<D>__{it's starting. there isn't much time.}
<A>__{the cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other "what the hell?" then they turn back to michael.}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{shut the fuck up and drop the bags now!}
<A>__{michael lets the gun bags hit the ground.}
<C>__{estevez}
<D>__{hands on your head! on your head!}
<A>__{michael slowly places his palms on his skull.}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{turn around! turn the fuck around!}
<A>__{michael slowly turns around. calm. estevez rushes in to restrain michael, grabbing his wrist, fingers tightening. michael closes his eyes, a terrible decision made. and that's when he moves, a fucking blur! in an instant michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. now it's michael who's in charge, gun to estevez's head, facing off with burton. burton struggles to find a shot, can't.}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{let `em go!}
<C>__{estevez}
<D>__{take the shot, burton!}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{i said let `em fuckin' g g g g }
<A>__{suddenly burton starts to shake, the words stuck in his throat like a skipping record.}
<C>__{estevez}
<D>__{burton!?}
<A>__{the street lamps begin to flicker and strobe, adding to the confusion. burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his whole body quaking, heels clicking the pavement, as if some massive pressure were building inside him. and with the horrific sound of cracking bones, burton's mouth}
<B>__{begins to twist into an impossibly wide smile like a bizarre}
<A>__{clown! his eyes snap open, focused, the force inside him now fully in control. burton looks at michael with calm recognition, his voice guttural..inhuman. a man possessed.}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{what are you doing, michael? these weren't your orders.}
<A>__{estevez looks at his partner with confusion.}
<C>__{estevez}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<A>__{michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm following my own orders now.}
<C>__{burton}
<D>__{then you will die along with the child.}
<C>__{estevez}
<D>__{burton, you fuckin' know this guy?!}
<A>__{blam! burton shoots his partner in the head. estevez drops, leaving michael without cover. burton re aims, but michael's faster, already firing back. bullets rip up the concrete. smash! the squad car window shatters, burton's chest exploding! and down he goes, leaving michael the only one left standing. smoke rising from his gun. with soldier like efficiency, michael picks up the rifle bags and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car. he gets in the car and floors it, roaring away, as the flickering street lamps finally go out in rapid succession, a wave chasing him, plunging the entire city into darkness...}
