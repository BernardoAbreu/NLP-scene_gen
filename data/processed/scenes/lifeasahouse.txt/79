<L>__{exterior george's shack morning}
<A>__{george is prying off the last of the boards when he's hit with a pain that takes him to his knees. he drops the crowbar and sits down in the dirt as guster walks over to comfort him. george takes deep breaths and closes his eyes as he tries to gain control over the pain.}
<L>__{interior alyssa's bathroom morning}
<A>__{the doorknob jiggles, jiggles and turns; alyssa opens the door and walks in dressed in a t shirt and panties. once again sam jumps and jams his elbow to the frosted glass as he partially opens the shower door.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{is this like a past time with people? go away!}
<A>__{alyssa sets a tiny screwdriver on the vanity.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i've seen lots of people. it's not a big thing for me.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hand me a towel. i'm getting out.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i'm coming in.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't want you to!}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{we're not gonna do anything.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{why are you so stupid?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{why are you so uptight?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't even...what do you mean? i don't even know what that means.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{it means i'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hand me a towel. hand me a towel.}
<A>__{sam is anxious. alyssa takes off her t shirt and pulls down her panties before grabbing a towel; she hands it to sam as she forces her way into the shower. barely visible through the frosted glass, alyssa wets her hair as sam stares in her direction. the towel drops to the tiled floor.}
