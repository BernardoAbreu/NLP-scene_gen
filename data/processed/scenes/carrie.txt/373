<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{carrie crawls farther and farther from the door, until she reaches the far end of the kitchen, just as margaret, the knife gleaming in her hand, pointed toward carrie, reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns toward the kitchen, mumbling all the while. carrie flexes: the kitchen door swings shut. margaret is coming toward the kitchen. carrie flexes again to hold the door shut. but it's no use margaret is relentless now, and the door opens. she raises the knife and starts toward carrie, the door swinging behind her.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i should have killed you when you were born.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{momma, i love you. please help me!}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{sin never dies.}
<A>__{there's nothing else to be done. carrie flexes, and a serving fork dangling from a hook on the way suddenly hurtles through the air, piercing margaret. it is followed by another and another as a rain of instruments strikes margaret. margaret collapses. carrie, horrified by what she's done, starts toward her mother. and then she and we see sue standing in the doorway, clasping her hand to her mouth, stifling her screams.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{you. you tricked me.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{get out.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{we were just trying to...}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{get out.}
<A>__{and then something hits the roof, rattling. a small sound. a stone. then another. then a third.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{get out! get out!}
<A>__{the stones are beginning to rain on the roof, like hail. sue is rooted to the spot, terrified.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{get out, get out, get out!}
<A>__{the stones are coming down harder. all sound as one or two of them break through the roof, rattle on the floor below.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{get out!}
<A>__{a stone of fairly small size crashes through into the kitchen. carrie flexes. and sue stumbles backwards toward the door. flex. sue is whipped around, as though by a great wind.}
