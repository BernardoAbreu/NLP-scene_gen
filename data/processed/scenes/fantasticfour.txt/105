<L>__{exterior interior upscale restaurant night}
<A>__{lights twinkle. a maitre d' leads us through fancy digs. heads turn, whispers flutter. sue steps out, joining... victor at a prime table. he pulls out her chair, wearing gloves.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{thank you for coming out to see me.}
<A>__{she nods, a little self conscious.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{you said it was urgent.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{it is. there's something we need to talk about. something i need to ask you...}
<A>__{sue senses where this is going, and she cuts it short.}
<C>__{sue}
<P>__{(slow, careful)}
<D>__{victor, wait, slow down a second. i want you to know i appreciate everything you've done for me, but i just don't }
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{susan. what are you doing?}
<A>__{he is cold as ice. if he's hurt, he'll never show it.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{you think i brought you here to talk about us? please. this is business.}
<P>__{(leaning forward, intense)}
<D>__{i need to know: how close is reed to finding to a cure?}
<A>__{she pauses. then:}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{he's working round the clock. but the data needs to be tested, analyzed before }
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{same old reed. all analysis, no action. wasn't that the problem with you two?}
<A>__{she holds tight, keeping cool.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{if these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{then why is reed dragging his feet? maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...}
<P>__{(closer, cruel)}
<D>__{it's ironic, isn't it? you're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his science project.}
<A>__{the words sting. she can't help but hear some truth in them.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{please don't make this personal }
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{oh, i think you already have.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.}
<A>__{victor's fist clenches metal sfx.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{"we," huh?}
<A>__{victor screeches his chair back, pushing the table so hard that he spills water. heads turn, all eyes on sue. victor gets close to her, too close, a hand on her shoulder.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{don't forget who you work for, susan. so get to work. and do your job.}
<A>__{he walks out. as he goes, he slips the engagement ring out of his pocket. he crushes the diamond to dust, leaves the dust in an ashtray, and disappears into the night. sue sits embarrassed. she slowly...disappears. people gasp. she walks out, invisible, save for her clothes, which drift through the air. at a table full of businessmen }
<C>__{businessman}
<D>__{i wish my wife would disappear.}
<A>__{the other men laugh, but whhm! the man's wine spills into his lap! sue walks out. the restaurant is left buzzing. lights twinkle. and we fade out: . a beat. then we crash}
