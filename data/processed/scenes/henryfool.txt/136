<L>__{interior garage night}
<A>__{the place is abandoned. henry comes in and, just as he is laying down to go to sleep on an old couch, finds pearl age fourteen. she is hardened and disturbed, but frequently vulnerable and scared; a troubled kid.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what are you doing here, pearl?}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{you want some?}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{some what?}
<A>__{pearl comes towards him. he is kneeling with his face at her crotch level when she reaches him. she holds out a bottle of cheap rot gut wine. realizing, he takes it and drinks. he winces.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{pearl laughs and falls back onto the couch, her sweater hanging off her shoulder and her skirt hiked up and displaying her underwear. henry stands and searches for something to sit on.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{come sit here.}
<A>__{she pats the couch beside her. he comes over, eyeing her carefully and sits. he hands back the bottle. she drinks, winces and sits staring at the flames.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{that's what my dad always says.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{pearl}
<P>__{(dead)}
<D>__{'you want some?'}
<A>__{henry looks away, uncomfortable. she slides her gaze over to him, their eyes meet, and she pins him to the spot.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{people say you were once in jail for having sex with a girl my age.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{that was a long time ago.}
<A>__{he gets up and stands at the window. pearl age fourteen watches him closely as she drinks, then...}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{you want some?}
<A>__{he looks over at her and she slides her coat off her shoulder. henry is sweating.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you oughta get outta here, pearl.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{i was here first.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{go home.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{you go home.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{and he starts to leave. but pearl sits up...}
<C>__{pearl}
<P>__{(scared)}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{henry stops and looks back at her.}
<C>__{pearl}
<P>__{(hanging her head)}
<D>__{i can't go home.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{he beat her up again.}
<A>__{henry holds his head, tries to sober up. he looks around the room, then focuses on the girl.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{warren beat up your mom?}
<A>__{pearl stares at the floor. she glances over at him, then back down at the bottle gripped in her hands. she nods. henry pauses, then comes across the room, lowering himself tentatively to the couch.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{is she alright?}
<A>__{she says nothing for a moment, then...}
<C>__{pearl}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{do you think i'm pretty?}
<A>__{henry lifts his hand and covers his face. he looks up at the ceiling and sighs. he returns to pearl...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{does she need help?}
<A>__{pearl reaches over and grabs his thigh. looking up at him, with tears rolling down her face, she suggests...}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{i will suck your cock if you kill him for me.}
<A>__{henry jumps away from her and pearl throws herself down on the couch, covering her face.}
