<L>__{interior police precinct detective room's squad day}
<A>__{a handful of detectives talk about work over burned coffee. eddie enters with jordy.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{guys...give me a few minutes?}
<A>__{they empty out.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{look, eddie, i'm tellin' you i didn't touch her.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{i took her there for a shower and that's it.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{just a shower?}
<A>__{eddie gives jordy a questioning look.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{yeah, just her in the shower. nothing happened. look, i'm sure you probably think i'm a fool and i fucked up, but...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{no, i don't think you were a fool, i just think you were stupid about it. i mean, to say the least, you outta know better. you don't know her well enough. she's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over. you can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. you're dead.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{i told you, you know, i thought i was doing the right thing, you know, i think she's innocent.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not. don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{but, i mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody? i mean, you shoulda heard her there. tellin' her whole story...i believed her.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer. here, here's a number of an immigration lawyer. that's how you help her. but you can't get involved in her like that. you're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case. and lemme give you another piece of advice. maybe you don't watch tv but i will let you in on a little secret the whole fuckin' world watches television. and when you get out there, they know your face. and the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job. and i get more done because of it.}
<A>__{jordy studies eddie for a quiet beat.}
<C>__{jordy}
<D>__{why'd you help me back there with the chief? why'd you stand up for me like that?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you know, i don't know. i like you. you remind me of a puppy i used to have. he pissed on the rug all the time, but i still kept him.}
<A>__{eddie picks up his cigar that's going out. he sticks it in his mouth. a match is lit. he looks up. jordy holds the match. eddie dips the end of the cigar and puffs. the homicide detective and the fire marshal hold a look.}
