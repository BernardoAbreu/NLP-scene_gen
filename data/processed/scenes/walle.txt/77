<L>__{interior wall e's truck}
<A>__{the interior is dark and still. suddenly the junk jingles and clinks as the back door opens. eve flies inside with wall e. sets him on the floor. she scans the rotating shelves at high speed. grabs a car jack. ratchets up wall e's crushed body...}
<B>__{quick shots}
<A>__{...spare parts being grabbed by eve... ...frantically installs the new parts into wall e... ...her arms a blur of precision in motion... ...replaces his damaged circuit board. the final piece... ...she opens his new solar panels... ...and blasts a hole in the ceiling with her gun.}
<B>__{out on the empty bay}
<A>__{the rejects stop. see the roof of wall e's truck explode. oh no.}
<B>__{back in the truck}
<A>__{a shaft of sunlight beams down on wall e. eve holds her breath, watches... waits... ...beep... ...beep...}
<P>__{wall e (o.s.) (apple "reboot" sfx)}
<A>__{wall e's meter fully charges. his head slowly rises from his box. blinks. the cockroach hops with joy. eve is relieved. ...she holds out her hand to him.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(with love)}
<D>__{wall e...}
<A>__{wall e gives her a blank stare. he turns away from eve. motors out the truck. she grabs him. turns him back around.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(it's me!)}
<D>__{eve!}
<A>__{wall e just stares. doesn't seem to know who she is.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(hums)}
<D>__{[here, look at these.]}
<A>__{she grabs the rubik's cube and light bulb from the shelf. the light bulb glows in her hand. she gives them to wall e. no reaction.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(remember?)}
<D>__{wall e?}
<A>__{wall e looks blankly at the junk on the shelves.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(hums)}
<D>__{[i know!]}
<A>__{she hovers over to the video player. plays hello dolly. looks back to see if it has any effect. wall e is over at the shelves. has scooped all his prized possessions into his compactor. crushes them into a cube. eve is gut punched. wall e motors outside. runs over the cockroach on his way out. the insect pops back to life. watches his friend in shock.}
