<D>__{have you seen the ratings for yesterday? we got beat by all the network shows, plus a rerun of "who's the boss". the one where the vacuum breaks.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{it's a temporary setback. this week we'll do better.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{the guy with the cable access show on channel 83 does better. if we programed jerry springer re runs, we'd do a nine share at a quarter the price.}
<A>__{abby looks worried.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{please tell me you're not thinking of killing the show.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{i'm not, but i can guarantee you that's what the new management's thinking.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{stuart, "sacramento am" is an award winning news program.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{management doesn't listen to awards. it listens to numbers. we're not a family run station anymore, abby. you're good at what you do, but you've got to get me some numbers. i've got two daughters in college and a son in beauty school. i don't know how much you know about vidal sassoon but that shit ain't cheap.}
<A>__{abby nods.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you can count on me, stuart.}
