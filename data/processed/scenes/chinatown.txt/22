<L>__{interior coroner's office evelyn and escobar}
<A>__{are standing over the body of mulwray. escobar has the sheet drawn back. evelyn nods. escobar drops the sheet. escobar and evelyn move a few feet to one side and whisper, almost as though they were trying to keep the corpse from hearing them.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{it looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. could he swim?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{obviously the fall must have knocked him out.}
<A>__{evelyn nods slightly escobar coughs. a coroner's assistant wheels the body out of the office.}
<C>__{escobar}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this alleged affair he was having. the publicity didn't make him morose or unhappy?}
<A>__{outside the coroner's gittes has been sitting on a wooden bench, smoking and listening. at this question, he rises and looks through the doorway. escobar sees him, ignores him. evelyn doesn't see him.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{...well, it didn't make him happy...}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{but there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{escobar}
<P>__{(a little uncomfortably now)}
<D>__{mrs. mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?}
<A>__{evelyn shows a flash of annoyance.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{do you know where she might be?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{certainly not!}
<A>__{escobar and evelyn move slowly toward the door.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{you and your husband never discussed her?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(stopping, faltering)}
<D>__{he... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name. we quarreled over her... of course. it came as a complete surprise to me.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{a complete surprise?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{but i thought you'd hired a private investigator.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{a private investigator?}
<C>__{escobar}
<P>__{(gesturing vaguely toward the door)}
<D>__{mr. gittes.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{well yes.}
<A>__{evelyn looks up to see gittes standing in the doorway only a foot or two from her. she stops cold. they look at one another for a long moment.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(her eyes on gittes)}
<D>__{but i... i... did that because i thought it was a nasty rumor i'd put an end to...}
<A>__{she finishes, looks plaintively at gittes. escobar is right at her back. gittes says nothing.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{and when did mr. gittes inform you that these rumors had some foundation in fact?}
<A>__{evelyn looks at escobar but doesn't know how to answer him.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(smoothly)}
<D>__{just before the story broke in the papers, lou.}
<A>__{escobar nods. they begin to walk slowly, again have to move out of the way as some other corpse is being wheeled out of one of the coroner cubicles.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{you wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{or her name?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{they have walked a few steps further down the hall.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{will you need me for anything else, lieutenant?}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{i don't think so, mrs. mulwray. of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i will walk her to her car, be right back.}
<A>__{escobar's pov evelyn glances at gittes. they go through a couple of outer doors and pass several reporters who have been in the outer hall, laughing, kidding, the tag end of lines like "only in l.a." and "southern cafeteria." gittes hurries her past the reporters who flank them, asking questions. gittes brushes them aside.}
<B>__{evelyn and gittes at her car}
<A>__{in a small parking lot. evelyn fumbles in her bag, looking feverishly for something in her purse.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{mrs. mulwray?... mrs. mulwray.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(flushed, perspiring)}
<D>__{...just a minute...}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(touching her gently)}
<D>__{you left your keys in the ignition.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{oh... thank you.}
<A>__{she glances down, leans against the side of the car.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{thank you for going along with me. i just didn't want to explain anything... i will send you a check.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{a check?}
<A>__{evelyn gets in her car.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{to make it official, i hired you.}
<A>__{she drives off, leaving gittes gaping.}
