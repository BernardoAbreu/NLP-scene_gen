<L>__{interior counselor's office day}
<A>__{the bell continues. it's a school bell signaling the end of the period.}
<B>__{on alex}
<A>__{as we see her for the first time, startled. she's seventeen and pretty, though in a simple way. her eyes are the most striking. deep. intense. if alex has a problem, it's the fact that she thinks too much, and it's reflected in her eyes. across from her is mr. weaver, a high school guidance counselor and that was his voice we heard with alex's. he's unexceptional, middle aged, incapable of really hearing what alex has to say. this is his office we're in. typical "say no to drugs" teen propaganda decorate the room. fun. as the bell dies we hear the army of footsteps outside, students milling in the halls. alex glances at the door and starts to rise from her chair.}
<C>__{mr. weaver}
<D>__{we don't have to stop now...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{that's okay. i've got a test coming up anyway. gotta study.}
<C>__{mr. weaver}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{i have to tell you, i'm a little concerned about you, alex. it's been three months now since your mother, uh...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(offering, fixing him with a stare)}
<D>__{killed herself?}
<A>__{mr. weaver stops, more than a little uncomfortable.}
<C>__{mr. weaver}
<P>__{(reluctant)}
<D>__{yes. now your father...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{he's a basket case. you've talked to him. you know that. he might as well be dead too.}
<A>__{alex glances down at the floor, anything to avoid looking at the counselor. she heaves a backpack onto to shoulder.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{look mr. weaver, i don't even know why i came here. i fine. really.}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{it's like i said. it's just part of the past now. it doesn't matter anymore.}
<A>__{she turns, and before mr. weaver can respond, she's out the door.}
