<A>__{he's going to kill cates. but first be glances at algren. then, almost casually, shoots him twice with cates' .44. algren staggers back. dead before he hits the floor. cates twists sideways just as ganz fires. the bullet misses. again frizzy starts screaming and struggling. ganz swipes the woman across the head with the gun. her body slumps to the floor. police sirens can be heard in the distance. cates makes an attempt for algren's gun. a bullet splatters against the floor only inches from his outstretched fingers. the gun skitters out of reach.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{you lying son of a bitch...}
<C>__{ganz}
<D>__{what are you talking about? we didn't kill her ...}
<A>__{ganz smiles. with your own gun, cop. how does it feel? cates leaps into a wooden phone booth. ganz leisurely blasts away at the booth with both his and cates' gun. two bullets crash into the booth. ganz moves to check inside the booth but sirens are ominously near. ganz finally retreats out the entrance.}

<C>__{cates}
<D>__{are you gonna tell me about police procedure? do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.}
<C>__{young cop}
<D>__{i guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...}
<A>__{cates loses it for a second, lands on him with both hands, pushes him against a wall... the room goes quiet. cates cools down.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{just shut the fuck up.}
<A>__{the other cops don't intervene. they just watch. cates cools down, straightens up. haden walks by, or, rather, speeds by.}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{cates, i will need to see you in five minutes, exactly five.}
<A>__{the old cop hands cates a gun, a traditional army .45...}
<C>__{old cop}

<A>__{haden continues moving away.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{five minutes. i heard you, your voice carries...}
<A>__{as cates is examining the gun, ruth, a lab technician, enters and drops three 8 x 10's on the desk near cates.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{they're still wet.}
<A>__{cates lifts the blow ups, each one showing a different aspect of a spent bullet.}
<C>__{ruth}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{lots of people getting shot with .44's lately ... last year, it was saturday night specials..now it's heavy stuff. people must be getting madder about something.}
<A>__{cates starts pinning the blow ups onto a large bulletin board on the wall. nearby, at the same time (within cates' line of sight, within earshot), lisa, the hooker, is being interrogated by a police woman who pulls the statement off the typewriter. nearby, the indian hooker is being interrogated in spanish.}
<C>__{policewoman}
<D>__{you're an accessory to murder one, so you're going to have to do a whole lot better than what we got down here, honey...}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{gimme a break, huh? ... look, i got there. he was a trick just like any other for all i knew. that's all there is. he didn't feel like sitting and talking. he was in a big hurry to get laid. i was with him about an hour...}
<A>__{cates has gotten interested in the last part of this ... drifts toward her... a detective comes through, begins distributing i.b.m. printouts to cates, the other nearby officers..}
<C>__{detective}
<D>__{we got a print from the hotel room. guy's real name is ganz, albert ganz. a hitter from back east but he worked out here a few years back. armed robbery. broke out of prison two days ago and capped two of the guards. a real animal. wait'll you see this...}
<A>__{cates reads the printout, then smoothly,imperiously, he takes over the questioning of lisa.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{did he give you a return match?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{he wasn't interested.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{maybe he didn't like your performance.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i will take a raincheck...}
<A>__{from the side, ruth is pointing at the photos...}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{this'll interest you, jack...we've got something here from your gun... and these are from the first weapon ganz used...}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{here.}
<C>__{cates}
<A>__{she turns, produces the third photo. pins it beside the one from the walden hotel.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{a perfect match for the markings from the first gun he used... but not from the walden hotel... fired at least six hours earlier...at point blank range... right between the eyes. found him on a park bench...}
<A>__{she shows him two more pictures. police forensics shots of henry wong ... very dead on the park bench...}
<C>__{ruth}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ya know, there are some very bad people out there in the world.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{look at it this way, ruth. if there weren't, what would there be for us to do?}
<A>__{lisa continues with the policewoman.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{anyway... so i got there and took him down. he started watching television and then you sensational people started banging on the door... that's all... except ... he's gonna give you guys a hard time.}
<C>__{cates}
<A>__{cates looks up as he hears that remark. notices kehoe, another detective, entering with a long suitcase.}
<C>__{policewoman}
<D>__{what makes you think so?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i think he liked shooting cops a lot more than getting laid.}
<A>__{cates watches kehoe unpack the box.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{is that what this guy ganz had in the hotel?}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{every last bit of it. the big guy's room was empty.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i will help you out.}
<A>__{cates and kehoe start going through the suitcase. kehoe produces a speed loader for a .44...}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{this guy must have had a .44 like yours, jack. now he's got yours.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{kehoe next produces several boxes of shells.}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{this cat was real serious about his artillery.}
<A>__{an attendant comes through, hands kehoe a file. he opens it, shows the file to cates who reads the name under the mug shot.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{billy bear...}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{backup man from the east bay. worked with ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.}

<D>__{who are all these?}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{they all pulled a bunch of jobs with ganz about four years ago.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{uhh ... wong, henry wong. he was in on the same job.}
<A>__{cates spins the file around so that both ruth an kehoe can see it, throws the forensic shots down beside it.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{tell me that's not the same guy.}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{hey ... dick tracy.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{did ganz have a grudge against his old friends?}
<A>__{haden comes out of his office.}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{get in here, cates.}
<A>__{cates ignores him.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{i think i wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking. can we find them?}
<C>__{kehoe}
<D>__{here's the file. cates checks the file.}

<D>__{yeah, i read the report...}
<A>__{haden shuffles some papers, seems to ignore cates.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{hey, the bastard's got my gun. i want it back.}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... in other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... i know, we all know the truth's a little different.}
<A>__{cates almost smiles at haden.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?}
<C>__{cates}

<C>__{haden}
<D>__{you might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, jack.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... besides, i got a lead...}
<C>__{haden}
<D>__{okay. you're not a team player. you gotta do things your own way. fine. nail this guy and make us all look good. but you better watch your ass. if you screw up, i can promise you, you're goin' down.}
