<A>__{a bright, fluorescent corridor filled with garish advertising and harried travelers rushing to make planes... and we find sam coming down this concourse, carrying his duffle bag, his face expressionless. he reaches a revolving door but stops... doesn't pass through... sees lynn, paige, and his mother waiting for him on the other side... their happy, expectant faces... but they don't see him yet... and he just stays here... hidden... watching them through the glass... and as sam puts it, at this moment he realized he would never look at his own family the same way again... in some way lost to them forever after what he saw on the side of road in yei... ... and finally he forces a smile, pushes through the revolving door and we watch, from this side of the glass, as paige leaps into his arms... lynn and daisy moving to him too, embracing him, welcoming him home.}
