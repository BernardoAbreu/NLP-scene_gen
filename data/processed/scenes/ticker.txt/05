<L>__{interior captain's office day}
<A>__{behind his desk, a work weary captain, winters, 50s, sucks coffee as he grills artie pluchinsky, 40s, a slick suit and tie homicide detective.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{prints?}
<C>__{pluchinsky}

<C>__{reilly}
<P>__{(at a loss, sad)}
<D>__{sir, i }
<A>__{reilly looks at his watch (we notice he's now wearing rice's watch). he taps it, listens to see if it's ticking.}
<C>__{winters }
<P>__{(softening)}
<D>__{dammit, rice was a good man,}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{i want to work this.}
<C>__{pluchinsky}
<D>__{you're vice, not homicide. besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{but sir }
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{you know the rules. you're off the street `til i.a.d. clears the investigation. now go home and clean yourself up, get some rest...}

<A>__{reilly picks up a twisted plastic wire bracelet.}
<C>__{pluchinsky}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{bracelet she was wearing.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in scranton.}
<C>__{pluchinsky}
<D>__{maybe she knows your old man.}
<A>__{reilly sears into pluchinsky.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{take it down to the bomb squad, artie }
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{i will do it.}
