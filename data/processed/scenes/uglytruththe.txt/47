<A>__{we intercut.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{oh my god. sorry.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{who's doug?}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{just a guy i'm seeing. it's nothing serious.}
<A>__{abby hesitates. mike shoves her.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{just a guy i'm seeing. it's nothing serious.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{mike}

<C>__{abby}
<D>__{hang on a sec.}
<A>__{mike puts the phone on hold.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{what now?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{make him wait.}
<A>__{a long pause.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{this is so rude.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{that's the pointerior}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{when do i pick up?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{never. you make him wait until he gets frustrated and hangs up. if he's still holding on after thirty more seconds, you may actually have a chance.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you'd better be right about this.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{think about it. would you wait on hold for somebody you were trying to blow off?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you have a pointerior}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{just give me a little bit of time and i can make this guy your bitch.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(scoffing)}
<D>__{i don't want a "bitch." and colin would never be a bitch. he's a well rounded man capable of mature emotions and deep abiding love. things which you know not of.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{maybe not, but i know about lust, seduction, and manipulation. and clearly, you do not.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{why would you want to help me?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{because then you'll have to admit that i know more about this stuff than you do.}
<A>__{they stare each other down. then mike looks at his watch.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{thirty seconds.}
<A>__{the phone light is still blinking.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{my god, you're right. now what?}
<A>__{mike hangs up the phone.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{always make an impression. let's get out of here. we have work to do.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{but what about }
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{don't worry, in five seconds he'll call back.}
