<L>__{interior family room afternoon}
<A>__{a boy, age ten, sits on his head on the family couch and watches television upside down. his floppy brown hair spreads out in a circle in front of his red face. he changes channels with a remote control. he moves past the upside down cartoons and the upside down talk shows. he stops on an upside down picture of a crashed train. beat. his knees come forward as he flips over. he tumbles slowly off the couch and onto the carpet. jeremy dunne gazes at the television screen... a live aerial view of a train wreck smouldering below is seen. two trains are tangled like snakes. jeremy gets up and moves to a small table with a phone. next to the phone is a notepad. on it is written... "dad amtrak 177 3:40pm." jeremy looks at the television. at the bottom of the screen in red block letters that move from right to left are words and numbers..."the 3:40 amtrak 177 has derailed... amtrak emergency number is 1 800 777 4322... the 3:40 amtrak 177 has derailed...amtrak" jeremy doesn't take his eyes off the screen. he makes a small desperate noise that no one hears.}
