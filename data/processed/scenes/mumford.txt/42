<A>__{tight on computer screen. a health information "library" website has been called up on mumford's office computer. right now it's beginning to spew information about "chronic fatigue syndrome" definitions, signs and symptoms, diagnostic measures, etc. mumford is hunched over the computer, reading avidly. his printer is churning out hard copies.}

<D>__{we'll turn back anytime you want.}
<C>__{sofie}
<P>__{(seeing something)}
<D>__{oh boy... this should be interesting.}
<A>__{mumford looks out toward the street. a woman in her fifties is turning into the front walk. she stares at them, unsmiling, as the two parties converge. she is mrs. cook.}
