<A>__{a dozen big, low fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles distort and feed back the executive's voice through the room. at the back, under a loudspeaker, sits duke $40 fbi wingtips, a pat boone madras sportcoat, and an official name tag: raoul duke, private investigator, l.a. gonzo sits beside him. his name tag: dr. gonzo. expert, criminal drug analysis. he's nervous close to the edge.}

<P>__{(lowers his voice)}
<D>__{i saw these bastards in easy rider, but i didn't believe they were real. not like this. not hundreds of them!}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{they're actually nice people when you get to know them.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{man, i know these people in my goddamn blood!}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{don't mention that word around here. you'll get them excited.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{this is a fucking nightmare.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{right. sure as hell some dope dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.}
<C>__{cop in back}
<D>__{sssshhh!}
<A>__{dr. blumquist a "drug expert" takes the stage.}
<C>__{dr. blumquist}
<D>__{we must come to terms with the drug culture in the country... country... country...}
<A>__{the sound systems echoes.}
<C>__{dr. blumquist }
<D>__{the reefer butt is called a "roach," because it resembles a cockroach... cockroach... cockroach...}
<C>__{gonzo}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{what the fuck are these people talking about? you'd have to be crazy on acid to think a joint looked like a goddamn cockroach!}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{it was clear that we had stumbled into a prehistoric gathering.}
<C>__{dr. blumquist}
<D>__{now, there are four states of being in the cannabis, or marijuana, society: cool, groovy, hip, and square. the square is seldom if ever cool. he is not "with it," that is, he doesn't know "what's happening." but if he manages to figure it out, he moves up a notch to "hip."}
<A>__{duke and gonzo listen in disbelief.}
<C>__{dr. blumquist }
<D>__{and if he can bring himself to approve of what is happening, he becomes "groovy." after that, with much luck and perseverance, he can rise to the rank of "cool." a cool guy... cool guy... cool guy...}
<C>__{cop in back}
<D>__{dr. bloomquist, do you think the anthropologist, margaret mead's strange behavior of late might possibly be explained by a private marijuana addiction?}
<C>__{dr. blumquist}
<D>__{i really don't know, but at her age, if she did smoke grass, she'd have one hell of a trip!}
<A>__{roars of laughter.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{i know a hell of a lot better ways to waste my time than listening to this bullshit.}
<A>__{he stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and plunges down the aisle to the door.}
<C>__{cop in back}
<D>__{down in front!}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{fuck you! i have to get out! i don't belong here!}
<C>__{cop in back}
<D>__{good riddance!}
<A>__{he stumbles from the room. duke turns his attention back to the stage. the lights go down. a black & white film reefer madness! illustrates his now evangelical talk.}
<C>__{film narrator}
<D>__{know your dope fiend! your life may depend on it! you will not be able to see his eyes because of tea shades, but his knuckles will be white from inner tension...}
<A>__{duke turns his attention to a 340 pound texan police chief who necks with his 290 pound wife beside him.}
<C>__{film narrator}
<D>__{... and his pants will be crusted with semen from constantly jacking off when he can't find a rape victim...}
<A>__{duke gazes at the texan and his wife. feigning sickness, he gets up, hand over mouth.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{pardon me, i feel sick.}
<C>__{film narrator}
<D>__{he will stagger and babble when questioned. he will not respect your badge. the dope fiend fears nothing. he will attack, for no reason, with every weapon at his command including yours...}
<A>__{duke heads for the exit.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{sorry, sick... beg pardon! feeling sick...}
<C>__{film narrator}
<D>__{beware. any officer apprehending a suspected marijuana addict should use all necessary force immediately. one stitch in time [on him] will usually save nine on you.}
