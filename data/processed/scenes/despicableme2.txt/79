<A>__{gru and lucy carry an unconscious shannon out of the restaurant. her head gets stuck in the swinging doors on the way out. they try to dislodge her and accidentally end up throwing her headfirst into a lamp post. they pick her up between them, weekend at bernie's style. they wave to a passing cop. the cop tips his hat.}
