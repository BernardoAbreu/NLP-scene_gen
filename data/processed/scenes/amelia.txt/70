<L>__{interior train day}
<A>__{a train rumbles through countryside. a private compartment finds amelia staring out the window. george studying her.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{the irony is, i'd finally put that wedding day letter out of my mind. stopped watching every beautiful accomplished man who crossed her path.}
<A>__{reverse angle. through the glass of our compartment door, a crowd stands jouncing against each other. gazing at their queen of the skies.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{i had a call from the byrds. they've asked us to dinner thursday.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{thursday, i will be in boston. meeting gene vidal and paul collins.}
<A>__{said lightly. not even looking at him. while through the glass, it's become quite a tussle.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{don't tell me gene wants to resurrect transcontinental?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{no, he's starting a shuttle service. washington, new york, boston...}
<A>__{one woman goes flying from view, as a younger one gets her place.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{could be a money maker for us. get me off the lecture grind.}
<A>__{he stares in her eyes. almost as if looking for something.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{gene's a dashing guy. he could talk anyone into anything.}
<A>__{their look holds.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{sounds like a great idea.}
