<L>__{interior subway port authority night}
<A>__{max paces on a downtown train as it pulls into 42nd street. through the open doors, max notices a young photographer in jeans and a leather jacket photographing him from the uptown platform. max is enraged and screams at him. the man ducks behind a column, but a few moments later he's back snapping pictures. the doors start to shut, but max uses his body to get off the train. the photographer sees him coming and flees. max follows the man's movement on his platform. when the young man shoots up the exit stairs, max does so as well. max catches a glimpse of his foe entering the catacombs heading toward times square. max pursues. max chases him down a looooong passage. but he loses him at an underground five way fork in the road. one staircase is uptown and queens... another is brooklyn...one other is unlabeled. still enraged, max marches forward just then, he catches a glimpse of the photographer exiting the station.}
