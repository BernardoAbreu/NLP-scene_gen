<L>__{interior catherine's car late day}
<A>__{james is driving. he looks across at catherine. she sits very still, pale, one hand on the window sill.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{the traffic... where is everyone? they've all gone away.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i'd like to go back. james...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{not yet. it's only beginning.}
<L>__{exterior familiar stretches of road late day into night}
<A>__{they drive past stretches of road we have seen before: the underpass near the wrecker's yard, several accident sites and filling stations, etc.}
<L>__{exterior airport filling station night}
<A>__{one of the filling stations is near the airport. as they cruise by it, they spot vera seagrave talking to a girl attendant at the pumps. james turns into the forecourt. vera is dressed in a heavily insulated leather jacket, as though she were about to leave on an antarctic expedition. james calls to her from the car.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{vera! vera seagrave!}
<A>__{at first she fails to recognize him. her firm eyes cut across him to catherine's elegant figure, as if suspicious of her cross legged posture. james gets out of the car and approaches vera. he points to the suitcases in the rear seat of vera's car.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{are you leaving, vera? listen, i'm trying to find vaughan.}
<A>__{vera finishes with the girl and, still staring at catherine, steps into her car.}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{the police are after him. an american serviceman was killed on the northolt overpass.}
<A>__{james puts his hand on the windshield, but she switches on the windshield wipers, almost cutting the knuckle of his wrist.}
<C>__{vera}
<D>__{i was with him in the car at the time.}
<A>__{before james can stop her, she accelerates toward the exit and turns into the fast evening traffic. james gets back into catherine's car.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i think he'll be waiting for us at the airport.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{james...}
<A>__{james turns the car into the traffic.}
