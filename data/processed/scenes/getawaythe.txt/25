<A>__{moments. carol starts to speak but doesn't. he is preoccupied, lost in his own thoughts. finally he stands, looking down at her. he slowly takes off his coat, folds it, lays it on the grass, then turns and starts walking towards a tree. suddenly he takes off his shoes, breaks into a run and dives for the rope. carol is already on her feet, her sweater off, shoes kicked aside, she runs after him and hits the water with an awkward splash. she is a brief second behind him. they come up together, and he laughs with the pure joy of being free and alive. she joins him, in his laughter and with their arms around each other, they turn as they are swept down stream.}
