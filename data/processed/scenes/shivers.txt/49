<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{an old man and his wife, the spergazzis, are taking their late night constitutional through the halls of the south tower. their arms are linked and they both walk with the aid of canes, the ultra modern aluminum kind with four rubber tipped prongs at the end.}
<C>__{mr. spergazzi}
<D>__{lovely, lovely evening. very quiet, eh?}
<A>__{mrs. spergazzi nods and smiles, patting mr. spergazzi's hand. they round a corner which leads them down the stretch of hall which passes by tudor's door. as they approach tudor's door they notice a plastic milk jug lying in the hall just below the open milk chute door. mrs. spergazzi detaches herself from her husband and bends down with difficulty to pick up the jug.}
<C>__{mrs. spergazzi}
<D>__{eh, the children in this apartment, they're such little thieves. you have to put a lock on everything.}
<A>__{she puts the jug back in the milk chute. she notices the blood smeared on it just a second before the parasite in the chute fastens itself to her wrist with its suckers. she stares at her wrist in astonishment. she is wearing the parasite like some monstrous, spongy, oozing wristwatch. she tries to shake the thing off. it can't be dislodged. she turns in disbelief to her husband and then screams at the top of her lungs. mr. spergazzi lifts his cane and tries to strike the thing with the cane's prongs. the force of his blow throws him off balance and he falls, dragging his wife down with him. mrs. spergazzi moans in pain and terror. her husband manages to get to his knees and begins to smash at the thing with his cane. white burning fluid begins to squirt everywhere. mrs spergazzi's forearm begins to smoke, bubble, and dissolve. she becomes hysterical. mr. spergazzi continues to smash away at the thing, now with some success.}
