<L>__{exterior ronnie's house night}
<A>__{roper's pickup pulls up in front. he gets out. paco jumps out behind him. it's raining harder. they hurry up the walkway toward the house. suddenly roper realizes he forgot the wine. he goes back to the truck. paco pads after him. roper opens the driver's side door, reaches in and grabs the wine. he closes the door, starts away, but pauses to check himself in the window. suddenly, a floodlight comes crashing through ronnie's front bay windows. it sparks and flashes. still plugged in, it bungees to a stop hallway down the front of the house. flickering and flashing. roper rushes toward the house... crashes through the front door... up the stairway... paco bounds after him... roper hits her front door running... wham! he bounces off. he shoulders it again... the door doesn't give... he pulls out his gun... bam! bam! shoots off the lock.}
