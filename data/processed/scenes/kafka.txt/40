<A>__{the quarries night on the outskirts of the city, beyond the castle. mr. pick and the strange man approach. some distance behind them, kafka takes cover behind a tree, watching. mr. pick leads the strange man down the central quarry to where a third man, a laborer by the look of him, is waiting. kafka finds a vantage point somewhere above the central quarry. he flattens himself on the ground and peers over the edge. in the quarry, mr. pick steps back a pace from the strange man as they meet up with the laborer and suddenly grabs the strange man, pinning his arms behind him, baring his chest or the laborer to stab a dagger into! kafka is shocked by the abruptness of this. he sees the strange man slump to the ground. he crawls a little closer. he sees the laborer replace the knife in its sheath on his belt, then help mr. pick drag the strange man off to some side shadows where they dump him. kafka strains forward a little, trying to make out their faces and the ground gives way!}
