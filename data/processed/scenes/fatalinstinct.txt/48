<A>__{she's in the bathtub, phone receiver in one hand, still jabbing at the porcelain tub with the ice pick. water squirts from the holes she's punctured in the side of the tub. she flings the ice pick at the wall. it sticks!}
<L>__{exterior park day}
<A>__{lana is seated on a park bench wearing a trenchcoat, hat and sunglasses. frank walks up, looks around nervously, pretending not to know lana. he sits down next to her.}

<D>__{how come we gotta meet here?}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{we have to be careful now. we can't risk being seen together at the house or someone might connect us to the murder later on.}
<A>__{she hands him a hat.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{here... put this on.}
<A>__{she takes her sunglasses off, looks at him. he hesitates, staring at the hat. a dignified looking older gentleman approaches. frank quickly slips the hat on his head. the older gentleman sits on the bench across from them. he opens a paper sack and begins neatly laying his lunch out next to him. an apple, sandwich, napkin, mountain dew.}
