<L>__{interior house night}
<A>__{hector is giving lucinnius a soothing shoulder massage. lucinnius is still in a talking mood. his troubles won't allow him to relax.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{cyprian loaned me half a million to fit out these ships... i'm finished. just when things were going well... i had plans for you too, hector... in four or five years i was going to make you a free man... and then in ten years you'd be a citizen... you... you could've found your family... brought them here... everything...}
<A>__{hector smiles ruefully.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{it sounds good.}
<A>__{lucinnius misses the irony in hector's voice and enthuses about his own future generosity.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{it does, doesn't it!}
<A>__{lucinnius is silent for a while as hector continues to rub his shoulders.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{i shouldn't give up. i can't... i will visit cyprian, first thing tomorrow... before the others can get to him... he's got to see reason... i can pay him back... sometime. it's the only chance we have, hector. should i do it?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you must.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{you're right. i must.}
<A>__{this burst of resolve has relaxed lucinnius. his tense muscles yield more to hector's fingers. thalia enters the room. she is a household slave, a nubian from africa. she carries a lighted torch and moves around the room lighting the wall lamps. lucinnius watches her.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{thalia, i think i need one of your massages. hector, you can finish the lamps.}
<A>__{hector does as he is told. he takes the torch from thalia and discreetly leaves the room, hearing lucinnius as he closes the door.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{lower, thalia.}
