<L>__{interior george's studio set jungle decor day}
<D>__{thanks to a montage of shot frames, photos and press cuttings, we see george begin making his film, the first clap of the board that shows he's both the film's producer and director. the film is called tears of love, and it tells the tale of an english adventurer played by himself accompanied by a young woman, an old man who looks like a professor and who is probably the father of the young woman and, lastly, an african tribe represented as savages and whose humanity remains to be proven. we see george in the various stages of preparation: writing, re writing, directing, acting, signing a lot of checks, but also leaving very early in the morning to set up shots with his collaborators, etc. he looks fulfilled, like he truly believes in what he's doing, despite the tiredness he's feeling. his dog has a role in the film too, doing tricks. george looks very happy, very committed. he takes a supple branch, feeds it through the sleeves of a woman's blouse and, by holding the two ends of the branch out in front of him, dances with the imaginary woman. everyone around him is happy and laughing. he's not shooting a comedy, however, it's obviously a drama of some sort from what we see of the set and the way the actors play their role. then appear on screen the mock ups of posters, they are shown on the set to george. he chooses the one in which he is most prominent, it's a poster depicting a cutesy melodrama and bears the release date october 25th.}
