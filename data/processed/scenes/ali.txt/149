<L>__{interior the ring over ali}
<A>__{past him, hearing him, we are him. we think what he thinks; see what he sees. quarry's corner worked on the cut. ali feints a left and throws a left cross over quarry's attempt to block it. quarry comes in again. ali's next three ripping left jabs almost like karate shots...all with a sharp snap at the point of impact... quarry's eyebrow streams blood... interposing himself between their arms...}
<B>__{referee}
<A>__{stops the fight. irish jerry quarry damned by skin that cuts and bleeds.}
<B>__{crowd}
<A>__{goes nuts! their champion has returned. ali throws his arms in the air. quarry's arguing not to have the fight stopped. now he appeals to ali! close: ali + quarry ali knows quarry's anguish. they embrace. ali says things to him. and for that moment they are an island. ali and quarry, their arms interlocked, are their own tribe. two pugilists, no longer adversarial, a class unto themselves. then... ali's picked up by angelo. bundini's run into the ring. ali's arrived. he is coming back.}
