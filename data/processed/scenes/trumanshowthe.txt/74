<A>__{truman's face stares out from a televison monitor. we slowly pull back to reveal that other smaller monitors surround the first until we find ourselves staring at a video wall in a room the size of a football field. the curved bank of monitors, suspended by cables from the ceiling, gives the appearance of a giant patch work mobile. investigating the screens we discover surveillance pictures from all over new york city, covering every facet of truman's life. camera angles from the interior of truman's house, his backyard, car, subway station, office, the deli he frequents, the seashore to which he is drawn, the park he visits with veronica, the abandoned freeway where he golfs with marlon, many of the locations strangely devoid of people. beneath the video wall is a state of the art mixing desk, its illuminated buttons glowing brightly in the gloom. facing the desk, several operators in high backed, high tech swivel chairs, wearing the slimmest of headsets. simeon, a meticulous young man with a penetrating gaze, sits directly in front of the largest of the monitors, co ordinating camera angles. christof stands over simeon's shoulder, staring intently at the live picture of truman now seated at a streetside cafe, continuing to inspect his surroundings. chloe hovers in the background. there is an uncomfortable silence in the control room as the production crew feel themselves under scrutiny for the first time. christof leans forward and talks soothingly into a microphone on the control panel.}
