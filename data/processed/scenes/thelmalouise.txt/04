<A>__{louise goes to the pay phone and dials a number.}
<L>__{interior thelma's kitchen morning}
<A>__{phone rings. thelma goes over to answer it.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(hollering)}
<D>__{i got it! hello.}
<L>__{interior restaurant morning}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(at pay phone)}
<D>__{i hope you're packed, little housewife, 'cause we are outta her tonight.}
<L>__{interior thelma's kitchen morning}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{well, wait now. i still have to ask darryl if i can go.}
<C>__{louise }
<D>__{you mean you haven't asked him yet? for christ sake, thelma, is he your husband or your father? it's just two days. for god's sake, thelma. don't be a child. just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud. tell him i'm havin' a nervous breakdown.}
<A>__{thelma has the phone tucked under her chin, as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them. we see various recipes torn out from women's magazines along the lines of "101 ways to cook pork."}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{he already thinks you're out of your mind, louise, that don't carry much weight with darryl. are you at work?}
<C>__{louise }
<D>__{no, i'm callin' from the playboy mansion.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i will call you right back.}
<A>__{thelma goes through the living room to the bottom of the stairs and leans on the banister.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{darryl! honey, you'd better hurry up.}
<A>__{darryl comes trotting down the stairs. polyester was made for this man, and he's dripping in "men's" jewelry. he manages a carpeteria.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{damnit, thelma, don't holler like that! haven't i told you i can't stand it when you holler in the morning.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i'm sorry, doll, i just didn't want you to be late.}
<A>__{darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and it's obvious he likes what he sees. he exudes over confidence for reasons that never become apparent. he likes to think of himself as a real lady killer. he is making imperceptible adjustments to his over moussed hair. thelma watches approvingly.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{hon.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{what.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(she decides not to tell him)}
<D>__{have a good day at work today.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{hon?}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{you want anything special for dinner?}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{no, thelma, i don't give a shit what we have for dinner. i may not even make it home for dinner. you know how fridays are.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a friday night. you'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and i am.}
<A>__{he's finally ready. he walks to the door and gives thelma the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{'bye, honey. i won't wait up.}
<C>__{darryl}
<D>__{see ya.}
<A>__{darryl leaves. we see his corvette parked out front. as he closes the front door, thelma leans against it.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{he's gonna shit.}
<A>__{thelma laughs to herself. she goes back into the kitchen and picks up the phone and dials it.}
