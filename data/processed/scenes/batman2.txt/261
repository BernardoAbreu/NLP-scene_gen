<L>__{interior library that moment}
<A>__{the room's a mess, books all over the floor. the groggy bruce props himself up against his desk. he manages to pull the bottom drawer open gropes frantically for the secret switch. he's crying.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{alfred...}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i will go back.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i can't...get down there...without you.}
<A>__{dick turns. to his amazement, the sectional bookcase is swinging open revealing the secret passage to the batcave.}
<L>__{interior entry hall front parlor that moment}
<A>__{we will all be pleased to know that alfred has only suffered a superficial wound to the arm. vicki is on her knees beside him; the penguin is watching them with utter contempt.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{what an extraordinarily stupid thing to do.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{shut up. help me with him.}
<A>__{the penguin rolls his eyes and orders frick and frack to give vicki a hand without him. they carry him into the parlor, lay him out on the sofa. vicki reaches into her purse for a handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the penguin pulls frack aside.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{you and i had better check the ground floor and see what's going on. mr. frick do you think you'll be able to manage this pair?}
<C>__{frick}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{oh, good. that does relieve my mind }
<A>__{he turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of cut cords on the love seat. the blood drains out of his face.}
<C>__{penguin }
<D>__{where's wayne???}
