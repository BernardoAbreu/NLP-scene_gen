<L>__{interior conference room night}
<A>__{a boardroom suite, overlooking london. lights twinkling around a conference table. twelve teddy bears. each six feet tall. ridiculous and sinister. in pink, turquoise, brown, black, white, green. furry, giant paws and ears, swivel eyes. one teddy sports a familiar tartan ... on the table, children's party food: jellies, hundreds and thousands, birthday cakes. and wrapped presents before each. each bear has a name badge: bobby, bobo, bruno, bibi, betty, binky etc. pinned to their fur. a children's tune, "the teddy bear's picnic," plays. followed by a gavel rapping order. a distinctively chilling voice, eerily familiar and seductive, which echoes through our story }
