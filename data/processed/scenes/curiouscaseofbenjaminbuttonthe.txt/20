<A>__{...he runs past a solemn maid and up a long staircase... barging into the master bedroom...}
<L>__{interior master bedroom, button house night 1918}
<A>__{... where we see a young woman is lying on a bloody bed, frantically being administered to by a doctor with the help of the small domestic staff... the priest enters...}
<C>__{thomas button}
<P>__{(seeing him)}
<D>__{why are you here?}
<C>__{the doctor}
<D>__{thomas, i'm afraid she's not going to survive...}
<A>__{and the priest bends to say last rites over the pretty young woman... and the maids, bringing bedsheets, futilely start to change her bloody linens...}
<C>__{thomas button}
<D>__{that's enough...! all of you!}
<A>__{they move out of the way... and thomas kneels beside his wife... she's pale white, fear in her soft brown eyes... he takes her hand...}
<C>__{thomas button }
<D>__{i came as quickly as i could... i'm sorry i took so long, the streets are filled with people...}
<A>__{as if to underscore it, fireworks go off...}
<C>__{thomas button }
<D>__{you are going to be alright, my dearest darling... i will not let anything happen to you...}
<C>__{his young wife}
<D>__{promise me, thomas...}
<A>__{and she is interrupted by the sudden cry of a baby. but thomas can't take his eyes from his dying wife...}
<C>__{his young wife }
<D>__{promise me, he has a place...}
<A>__{he doesn't understand... she looks up at him... holds his hand tight... then she slips away... the doctor listening for her pulse... he covers her... it's quiet... the priest's murmured incantations... the housemaids crying...}
<C>__{benjamin button's }
<D>__{she gave her life for me... and for that i am forever grateful...}
<A>__{thomas, still holding her hand, is unable to let go... when we hear again the baby crying... the baby's cry is not quite right... it is not an infant's cry for succor, or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs... it's a deep, haunting cry from some primal soul... they all turn, and the room stills... listening as the baby continues its mournful wail. only thomas goes to answer... the baby in a basket, swaddled in a thick blanket, its face covered with cloth... thomas goes to lift it, to see his son's face...}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{mr. button...!}
<A>__{he lifts the cloth anyway... he recoils... for he has seen some kind of horror... he makes the smallest of sounds, a whispered "ohhhh." and then he suddenly snatches up the swaddled baby running with it out of the room... downstairs... outside...}
