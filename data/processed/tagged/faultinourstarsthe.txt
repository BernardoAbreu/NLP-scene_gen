<D>__{written by scott neustadter & michael h. weber based on the novel by john green may 1, 2012}
<C>__{first draft}
<A>__{hazel grace lancaster (16) lies in the grass, staring up at the stars. we're close on her face and we hear:}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{you have a choice in this world, i believe, about how to tell sad stories.}
<T>__{cut to :}
<A>__{a series of quick images: hazel and the boy we will come to know as augustus "gus" waters (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place. [they look very much like the perfect hollywood couple.]}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{on the one hand, you can sugar coat the way they do in movies and romance novels.}
<A>__{ "perfect" hazel and "perfect" gus sit on a bench overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country. she rests her head on his shoulder.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{where villains are vanquished and... heroes are born and...}
<A>__{ "perfect" hazel and "perfect" gus kiss in a dark room.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{... beautiful people learn beautiful lessons...}
<A>__{ "perfect" hazel and "perfect" gus fall onto a bed together. they look deep into one another's eyes.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{... and nothing is too messed up that can't be fixed with an apology and a peter gabriel song.}
<A>__{back to hazel on the grass, still watching the stars. were those dreams or were they memories? still unclear.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{i like that way as much as the next girl, believe me. it's just not the truth.}
<A>__{hazel closes her eyes.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{this is the truth.}
<A>__{and everything goes black. we hear:}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{sorry.}
<T>__{fade in on:}
<L>__{int doctor's office day}
<A>__{the real hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{late in the winter of my 17th year...}
<A>__{there are, however, some key and obvious differences. first, you'll notice the oxygen tube in her nostrils which help her to breathe. second, you'll notice her hair which we couldn't see in the grass. it's much shorter than the "perfect" version, the result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few years before.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{... my mother decided i was depressed.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i'm not depressed.}
<A>__{hazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table. her mother frannie (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains to the doctor:}
<C>__{frannie}
<D>__{... she eats like a bird. she barely leaves the house,}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i'm not depressed.}
<C>__{frannie}
<D>__{... she reads the same book over and over...}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{she's depressed.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i'm not depressed!}
<A>__{off her look, cut to: quick sequence, which play over:}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{the booklets and web sites always list depression as a side effect of cancer...}
<A>__{ a shopping mall. filled with teenage girls gossipping, laughing being teenage girls, basically. and here's hazel. with her mom. and her oxygen tank. just another day.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{depression's not a side effect of cancer...}
<A>__{ hazel's living room. she sits watching game shows in the middle of the afternoon. her mom brings her a sandwich. a glass of water. and then a whole host of prescription meds. hazel eyes them with indifference.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{... it's a side effect of dying.}
<A>__{ a starbucks. hazel sits alone reading a dog eared, heavily underlined copy of a novel ("an imperial affliction" by peter van houten). she only looks up when distracted by a squeal of delight. a young guy has lifted a young girl over his shoulder playfully. he spins her around. hazel watches a beat goes back to the book.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{which is what was happening to me.}
<A>__{and we cut back to:}
<L>__{int doctor's office same}
<A>__{frannie continues to talk to the doctor. hazel continues to dangle her feet.}
<C>__{frannie}
<D>__{... some days she won't even get out of bed.}
<A>__{the doctor scratches his beard, thinking.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i may switch you to zoloft. or lexapro. and twice a day instead of once.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{why stop there?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{keep `em coming. i can take it. i'm like the keith richards of cancer kids.}
<A>__{the doctor looks at frannie who just shakes her head.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{have you been going to that support group i suggested?}
<A>__{instead of answering, hazel looks at her mom.}
<C>__{frannie}
<D>__{she's gone a few times.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i'm not sure it's for me.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{if you're depressed }
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{i'm not de }
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(ignoring her)}
<D>__{ support groups are a great way to connect with people who are...}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{on the same journey.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{"journey?" really?}
<C>__{frannie}
<D>__{hazel.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{just give it a chance, ok? for me.}
<A>__{hazel rolls her eyes, knows she's lost this battle.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{who knows? you might even find it... enlightening.}
<T>__{smash cut to:}
<L>__{int church basement day}
<A>__{close up on patrick (30s, pony tail). he has a guitar.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{... we are gathered here today literally in the heart of jesus.}
<A>__{angle on hazel who just shakes her head. this is the lamest thing she could be doing right now.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{who would like to share their story with the group?}
<A>__{the basement is filled with sick people. hazel among them. most are under the age of 18. quick cuts:}
<D>__{speaker #1 jillian. 15. lymphoma. speaker #2 angel. 17. ewing sarcoma.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{patrick. 34. testicular. it started a few years ago, when i was...}
<A>__{as hazel watches, bored, and patrick continues, we hear:}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{i will spare you the gory details of patrick's ball cancer. basically, they found it in his nuts, cut most of it out, he almost died, but he didn't die, and now here he is divorced, friendless, addicted to video games, exploiting his cancertastic past in the heart of jesus "literally" to show us that one day if we're lucky we could be just like him.}
<A>__{they all say:}
<C>__{all in unison}
<D>__{"we're here for you patrick."}
<A>__{hazel says it the least enthusiastically. she locks eyes with her only friend in support group, a blonde kid with an eye patch, isaac. he's also shaking his head.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{who else would like to share?}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{hazel?}
<A>__{oh no. patrick gestures for her to speak. reluctantly she stands, sighs...}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i'm, uh, hazel. 16.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{thyroid originally but with quite the impressive satellite colony in my lungs.}
<A>__{not much more to say, hazel is about to sit down.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{and how are you doing hazel?}
<A>__{hazel has no idea how to answer that.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{you mean besides the terminal cancer?}
<A>__{but that's not what she says. she says:}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{alright? i guess...?}
<A>__{isaac tries not to laugh at this. hazel sits back down.}
<C>__{all in unison}
<D>__{"we're here for you hazel."}
<A>__{hazel exhales. this is not at all helpful. a few more beats.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{maybe now i will play a song...}
<L>__{ext church later}
<A>__{frannie sits in the car in the parking lot, reading from a book, waiting for group to be over. she sees the church door open and puts the book away. hazel comes out. frannie looks at her like "well, was it great?" hazel just exhales and gets in the car. cut to:}
<L>__{int hazel's living room another day}
<A>__{"america's next top model" is on the tv. hazel sits on one side of the l shaped couch, flipping through her novel. frannie and hazel's dad michael (40s, kind, doing his best to stay positive) sit on the other side, watching her but trying not to make it seem that way. after a few beats:}
<C>__{frannie}
<D>__{it's friday night.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{frannie}
<D>__{i was just thinking... you should call your friends, see what they're up to.}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(disinterested)}
<D>__{that's ok.}
<A>__{frannie and michael look at one another, don't say anything.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{wanna see a movie?}
<A>__{hazel looks up from the book. sees her parents. gets an idea.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{why don't you guys go to a movie?}
<P>__{(off their look)}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{you haven't been out in a while. go. have fun. take the night off.}
<A>__{frannie and michael look at one another again.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{this is a really good show.}
<A>__{hazel sighs. and just like that, everyone goes back to what they were doing. cut to: quick sequence, which plays over:}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{and that was my life.}
<A>__{ hazel watching tv, book in hand. hazel in another doctor's office. hazel popping pills.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{reality shows. doctor's appointments. eight prescription drugs, three times a day.}
<L>__{int hazel's kitchen another day}
<A>__{hazel and her parents in the kitchen.}

<D>__{and worse worse worst of all... support group.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{ugh. you can't make me.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{of course we can, we're your parents.}
<A>__{hazel frowns.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hazel, you need to get out of the house. make friends. be a teenager.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{if you want me to be a teenager, don't send me to support group. buy me a fake id so i can go to clubs and drink gimlets and take pot.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you don't take pot.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{see, that's the kind of thing i would know with a fake id.}

<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{and so i went...}
<A>__{frannie's car pulls up close to the back entrance.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{not because i wanted to or because i thought it would help. but for the same reason i did anything these days...}
<A>__{hazel, oxygen tank in toe, gets out of the car with frannie's assistance.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{... to make my parents happy.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{are you gonna sit here and wait the whole time?}
<C>__{frannie}
<D>__{of course not, no. i...}
<P>__{(she totally is)}
<D>__{i have errands to run.}
<A>__{hazel knows she's not planning to run any errands. she doesn't press the issue.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{frannie}
<D>__{love you.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{love you too mom.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{the only thing worse than biting it from cancer is having a kid bite it from cancer.}
<A>__{as frannie gets back in the car, she shouts to her daughter:}
<C>__{frannie}
<D>__{make some friends!}
<A>__{hazel just shakes her head. cut to:}
<L>__{int church same}
<A>__{hazel walks towards the elevator. an extremely sick looking kid holds it open for her. hazel thinks better of it.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i will take the stairs.}
<A>__{the kid nods. the doors shut. hazel is reminded it could always be worse. she turns to go, walking right into:}
<C>__{gus hazel}
<A>__{ooph. sorry! a supremely beautiful boy (we will come to know him as gus). tall, lean, muscular, straight short mahogany hair, blue eyes. hazel has never seen a better looking kid in her life.}
<C>__{gus hazel}
<A>__{my bad. no, it's... for a brief moment, the earth stops. they stand looking at one another. hazel is speechless.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{with the beautiful boy watching, a wan smile on his face, hazel shuffles off as fast as she can, ducking into:}
<L>__{int bathroom same}
<A>__{hazel catches her breath. shakes her head. surprised at herself. she looks in the mirror. so doesn't like what she sees. the earth starts moving again. cut to:}
<L>__{int church basement later}
<A>__{hazel sits in the circle of sick.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{who would like to begin?}
<A>__{no volunteers. hazel catches sight of the beautiful boy, sitting next to isaac. he seems to be watching her, that same flirty smile on his face. she self consciously looks away.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{isaac, i know you're facing a challenging time. perhaps you would like to say something...}
<A>__{isaac nods, rises.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{yeah, um... i'm isaac. 17. eye cancer.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's looking like another surgery in a couple weeks. after which, well, i will be blind...}
<A>__{hazel tries to focus on what isaac's saying but it's difficult. she still feels the beautiful boy's gaze on her.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{not that i'm complaining or anything. i know a lot of you have it way worse but, still, i mean, you know, being blind's gonna suck...}
<A>__{as isaac shares, the beautiful boy doesn't look away from hazel. hazel finds this intimidating. and intimidation irritates her. so she decides to play the game with him, meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly. a staring contest.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{...my girlfriend helps. and friends like augustus here...}
<A>__{isaac nods towards the beautiful boy who now has a name augustus. he still doesn't look away from hazel.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{so... yeah. that's what's up.}
<C>__{all in unison}
<D>__{"we're here for you isaac."}
<A>__{the staring contest continues another few beats until:}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{and does your friend want to speak?}
<A>__{this causes the beautiful boy to momentarily look away. aha, he's lost the contest! hazel smiles, flicks her eyebrows up as if to say "victory is mine!" he smiles back at her, the most radiant smile on the planet. he turns back to the group.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hi. i'm augustus waters. 17. had a touch of osteosarcoma bout a year and a half ago lost this baby as a result...}
<A>__{gus holds up his right leg a prosthetic.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{but really i'm just here at isaac's request.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{and how are you feeling augustus?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{me? oh i'm grand. i'm on a roller coaster that only goes up, my friend.}
<A>__{hazel smiles. gus catches this. embarrassed, she stops smiling and looks away.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{perhaps you'd like to share your fears with the group, augustus.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{my fears?}
<A>__{gus thinks about this.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{oblivion.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{oblivion?}
<A>__{angle on hazel, intrigued.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{yeah, see... i intend to live an extraordinary life. to be remembered. if i'm scared of anything it's... not doing that.}
<A>__{patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{would, uh, anyone like to speak to that?}
<A>__{and hazel's hand goes up. even patrick is surprised by that.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{hazel! that's unexpected.}
<A>__{hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. augustus watches her, waits for it.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i just wanna say... there will come a time when, you know, all of us are dead.}
<A>__{gus is now even more fixed on her than before.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{it might be tomorrow. might be a million years from now but... it's gonna happen. and when it does, enough generations will come and go, there'll be no one left to remember cleopatra. or mozart. or muhammad ali, let alone any of us, right?}
<A>__{the look on gus's face is unreadable.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{oblivion's inevitable. and if that scares you, well, i suggest you ignore it. god knows it's what everyone else does.}
<A>__{a beat. and then an enormous smile spreads across gus's face, not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. cut to:}
<L>__{ext outside the church later}
<A>__{hazel waits for her mom's car to appear. across the parking lot, she sees isaac going at it with a redhead, monica (17), sucking face like there's no tomorrow against the door of her green pontiac firebird. between kisses, we can hear:}
<C>__{isaac monica}
<A>__{always. always. and hazel hears:}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{literally.}
<A>__{hazel turns to find the beautiful boy, augustus, standing right next to her.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i thought we were in a church basement but apparently we were literally in the heart of jesus.}
<A>__{hazel smiles.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{someone should probably tell him, don't you think? jesus? seems kinda dangerous keeping all these kids with cancer in your heart.}
<A>__{gus laughs.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{hazel.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{no your full name?}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{hazel grace lancaster.}
<A>__{gus nods to himself, smiles. still fixated on her.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i didn't say anything.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{why are you looking at me like that?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{because you're beautiful.}
<A>__{hazel is taken aback. no one's ever said that to her before.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i enjoy looking at beautiful people and i decided a while back not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence. particularly given that, as you so astutely pointed out, we're all gonna die pretty soon.}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm not beaut }
<A>__{a cute young girl walks past them.}
<C>__{young girl}
<D>__{hey gus.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hey alisa.}
<A>__{hazel isn't surprised that other girls know gus. of course they do. she turns back towards isaac and monica pawing at each other. she hears:}
<C>__{isaac monica}
<A>__{always. always.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{what's with the "always?"}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{"always" is their thing. they'll "always" love each other and whatnot. must have texted "always" to each other at least four million times this year.}
<A>__{they continue to watch the show. it's pretty gross. isaac squeezes monica's breast like a clown horn.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{he's gotta be hurting her boob.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{let's watch a movie.}
<A>__{hazel is again surprised.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{oh. um. uh...}
<P>__{(yes!)}
<D>__{sure. yeah. i'm... pretty free this week }
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{no i mean now.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{what do you mean "now?"}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i've got a car.}
<A>__{he shrugs. hazel has never seen someone so confident.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you could be an axe murderer.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{there is that possibility.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{come on hazel grace... take a risk.}
<A>__{as hazel mulls this over, gus reaches into his pocket and pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes! hazel is in disbelief. he flips the box open, puts a cigarette between his lips.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{oh my god. oh. my. god. you're kidding right?}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{you just ruined the whole thing!}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{whole thing?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{what, you think that's cool? oh you idiot! there's always a hamartia, isn't there? and yours is even though you had freaking cancer you give money to a corporation for the chance to acquire even more cancer!? ugh. and you were doing so well.}
<A>__{as she rants, gus continues to look at her with that smile on his face. hazel does not find it so amusing.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{let me tell you... not being able to breathe? sucks. totally sucks.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hamartia?}
<A>__{hazel folds her arms and turns away from him.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{a fatal flaw.}
<A>__{gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still etched on his face.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{they don't hurt you unless you light them.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{sorry?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i've never lit one.}
<A>__{hazel turns back to him.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{it's a metaphor. see? you put the thing that kills you between your teeth. but you don't give it the power to do the killing.}
<A>__{hazel is floored. and impressed.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{metaphor.}
<A>__{gus holds her gaze. and it's at this point frannie pulls up.}
<C>__{frannie}
<D>__{hi sweetheart. ready for some "model?"}
<A>__{hazel looks at gus, cigarette dangling from his lips. cool as anything. handsome as hell. she looks back at her mom.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{can't tonight.}
<P>__{(off her confused look)}
<D>__{i've made plans with augustus waters.}
<A>__{and with that, she walks off. frannie looks at the boy with the cigarette in his mouth. this could be trouble. or awesome. or both. and we cut to:}
<L>__{int gus's car later}
<A>__{hazel is terrified. turns out, gus is the world's worst driver. when he brakes, her body flies forward against the seatbelt. and when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck snaps back in the seat. gus sees the look on her face.}

<D>__{i failed the test a couple times.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you don't say.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{most amputees can drive with no problem but... yeah. not me.}

<D>__{i'm surprised you have a license.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{tell me about it!}
<A>__{another brake forces hazel against the seat belt.}
<C>__{gus}

<D>__{aha. cancer perk.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{total cancer perk.}
<A>__{a few beats of silence.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{so what happened to you?}
<A>__{hazel takes a deep breath. she's told this story before but somehow this seems different.}

<T>__{quick series of scenes:}
<A>__{hazel continues "not to wait" for gus's call. we see her: brushing her teeth. and checking her phone. watching tv. and checking her phone. eating breakfast. and checking her phone. looking out the window on a rainy day. trying not to check her phone. willing herself to not check the goddamn phone. and checking the phone. where is he?! did he forget about her?}

<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(calling to isaac)}
<D>__{isaac, hazel from support group is coming downstairs.}
<A>__{gus waits for a response. none comes. he gestures for her to follow him into the room. before he does:}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{a gentle reminder: isaac is in the midst of a psychotic episode.}
<P>__{(hazel nods)}
<D>__{you look nice, by the way.}

<A>__{again, no response. hazel looks to gus for an explanation.}

<P>__{(beat)}

<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{fair enough.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{it doesn't hurt to talk to him, however. if you have any sage words of feminine advice...}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i actually think his response is appropriate.}

<D>__{"pain demands to be felt."}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(lights up at that)}
<D>__{you're quoting my book!}
<A>__{gus winks at her. at which point, isaac lets out another howl. gus gestures for hazel to sit. the two of them flank isaac. he finally speaks.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{she didn't want to do it after the surgery. said she couldn't handle it. i'm about to lose my eyesight and she can't handle it.}
<A>__{hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{i kept saying "always" to her. always, always, always. and she just kept talking over me and not saying it back. it was like i was already gone, you know? "always" was a promise! you can't break promises.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{sometimes people don't understand the promises they're making when they make them.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{right, sure, but you keep the promise anyway. that's what love is. love is keeping the promise anyway.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{that could be an "encouragement."}
<A>__{it's silent for a beat. and then isaac stands up, a funny look on his face.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{isaac...?}
<A>__{suddenly isaac starts kicking his chair across the room.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{here we go...}
<A>__{the chair lands against the bed. gus hands isaac something else to throw, a pillow. isaac grabs the pillow and slams it against the wall. he dives on it and beings pummeling the pillow like a maniac.}

<D>__{that's it! punch that thing.}
<A>__{and so he does. as he continues to, gus looks at hazel, cigarette dangling from his mouth.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i've been wanting to call you on a nearly minutely basis but i have been waiting until i could form a coherent thought in re: "an imperial affliction."}
<P>__{(she smiles)}

<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i know, right?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{the only problem is the ending.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{it is rather abrupt.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{it's torture! i mean, i totally get that she died or whatever anna. but there is an unwritten contract between author and reader and i think ending your book in the middle of a sentence kind of violates that contract.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{but that's part of what i like about it. it portrays death truthfully. you die in the middle of your life, in the middle of a sentence. but i do god, i do want to know what happens to everyone else.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{yeah like her mom.}
<C>__{hazel}

<A>__{gus hands isaac one of his basketball trophies.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you need to break something.}
<A>__{isaac looks at it, then back to gus as if asking permission. gus nods. isaac holds it over his head and smash! the trophy breaks into a million pieces. isaac almost smiles. gus hands him another.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{go to town, my friend.}
<A>__{and isaac does. smashing them one by one. hazel looks at gus.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i've been looking for a way to tell my dad that i kinda hate basketball. think maybe we've found it.}
<A>__{isaac grabs more of the trophies, smashing them to pieces. gus and hazel enjoy the spectacle. when there are none left isaac is panting, standing over the bronze carnage.}

<D>__{on the other hand... we need closure, don't we?}

<D>__{there are two }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{who the hell's "they?"}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{they are augustus and hazel, the young fans with whom you've been corresponding.}
<A>__{gus and hazel smile at hearing their names. perhaps this will help things take a turn for the better.}
<C>__{man in pajamas }
<D>__{the americans?}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{you invited them, remember?}
<C>__{man in pajamas }
<D>__{you know why i left america, lidewij? to never have to encounter americans. get rid of them.}
<A>__{hazel and gus can't believe it. this is terrible!}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{i will not do this peter. be nice.}
<A>__{at which point, the door opens opened by the woman whose voice they'd been hearing van houten's assistant lidewij (30s, dutch, pretty in a bookish way). she virtually shoves van houten towards a stunned gus and hazel. and they are again face to face with van houten. one beat, two beats. no one knows what to say. finally:}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{which of you is augustus waters?}
<A>__{gus raises his hand tentatively. van houten sizes them up. without another word, he turns and walks inside at least this time, leaving the door ajar.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{please. i am sorry. come in.}
<A>__{hazel and gus share one more awkward glance before gus takes a step. hazel follows. they walk:}
<L>__{int van houten's home same}
<A>__{lidewij leads gus and hazel into a living room so sterile it's creepy. the walls are empty and white, there's a single couch, a small ottoman, and a single lounge chair. that's it. van houten sits in the chair. off to the side are two large black garbage bags, full and twist tied.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{trash?}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{fan mail. 18 years worth. he never opens it.}
<A>__{van houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his slippers. he motions for them to sit on the couch.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{yours are the first missives to which i've replied and look where that got me.}
<A>__{hazel and gus take their seats.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{scotch?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{um, no thanks.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{augustus waters?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{it's 11am.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{just me then, lidewij. scotch and soda.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{perhaps some breakfast first peter?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{she thinks i have a drinking problem.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{i also think the earth is round.}
<A>__{nevertheless, lidewij pours peter half a glass and hands it to him. he takes a sip, then sits up straight.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{so you like my book.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{yes. we well, augustus, he made meeting you his wish so that we could come here and talk to you.}
<A>__{van houten says nothing. takes a long pull on his drink.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{did you dress like her on purpose?}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(looks at her shirt)}
<D>__{kinda.}
<A>__{van houten says nothing to that.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{i do not have a drinking problem. i have a churchillian relationship with alcohol: i can crack jokes and govern england and do anything i want to do. except not drink.}
<A>__{he glances over at lidewij, who dutifully refills his glass.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{incidentally, thank you for dinner last night.}
<C>__{van houten}
<P>__{(to lidewij)}
<D>__{we bought them dinner last night?}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{it was our pleasure.}
<C>__{van houten}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{you've come a long way so... what is it i can do for you?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{we have some questions }
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{uh huh...}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{about what happens, you know... after... the end of your book. specifically to those who anna leaves behind. like her mom, the dutch tulip man, sisy }
<C>__{van houten}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{how familiar are you with swedish hip hop?}
<A>__{hazel looks at gus. is he kidding?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i would say... limited?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{but presumably you know afasi och filthy's seminal album "flacken."}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{um...}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{lidewij! play `bomfalleralla' immediately.}
<A>__{lidewij sighs but she does as she's told. a few seconds later, some loud swedish rap song blasts from the speakers. hazel and gus sit through this, totally baffled.}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(yelling over the music)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir. we don't speak swedish.}
<C>__{van houten}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{who the hell speaks swedish? the important thing is not what nonsense the voices are saying, but what the voices are feeling.}
<A>__{the song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before gus has enough. he gets up and turns off the music.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{are you messing with us?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{pardon?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{is this some kind of performance?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{rudolf otto said that if you had not encountered the numinous then his work was not for you. and i say to you, my friends, if you cannot hear afasi och filthy's bravadic response to fearfulness, then my work is not for you.}
<A>__{hazel is really getting worried at this pointerior they came all this way for this?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{so anyway... when the book ends, anna's mom }
<C>__{van houten}
<P>__{(raising a hand to silence her)}
<D>__{let us imagine that you are racing a tortoise.}
<A>__{hazel and gus fidget in their seats. lidewij frowns, clearly feeling bad for them. van houten continues.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{the tortoise has a ten yard head start. in the time it takes you to run ten yards, the tortoise has moved maybe one yard. and so on, forever.}
<C>__{van houten }
<D>__{you are faster than the tortoise but you can never catch him, you see, you can only decrease his lead. now certainly you can run past the tortoise as long as you don't contemplate the mechanics involved but the question of how turns out to be so complicated that no one really solved it until cantor's proof that some infinities are bigger than other infinities.}
<A>__{hazel and gus have no idea how to respond.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{i assume that answers your questions.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(to hazel)}
<D>__{i don't know what's going on.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{and yet you seemed so intelligent in print, mr. waters.}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{must be all that cancer in your brain.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{peter!}
<A>__{gus could throw a punch right now. hazel tries to calm the situation.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{can we please, maybe, talk about anna for a sec? i mean, i understand that the story ends mid sentence because she dies or she becomes too sick to continue }
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{i'm not interested in talking about that book.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{ but that doesn't mean her family and everyone she loves doesn't have a future, right?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{i said i'm not interested }
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(getting upset)}
<D>__{but you promised!}
<P>__{(calms herself)}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{mr. van houten, you said you would tell us what happens and that's why we're here. we... i need you tell me. surely you've thought about it. i mean, as characters }
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{nothing happens to them! they're fictions. they cease to exist the moment the novel is over.}
<A>__{this is not what hazel came all this way to hear. she won't accept it.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{they can't!}
<P>__{(again, has to calm herself)}
<D>__{i mean, i understand. in a literary sense. but it's impossible not to imagine some future }
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{i can't do this. lidewij, get rid of them, please.}
<P>__{(lidewij doesn't move, he turns back to hazel)}
<D>__{i won't indulge your childish whims. i refuse to pity you in the manner in which you're accustomed.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i don't want your pity }
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{of course you do. like all sick kids, your existence depends on it.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{peter!}
<C>__{van houten}
<P>__{(on a roll)}
<D>__{you are fated to live out your days as the child you were when diagnosed, the child who believes there is life after a novel ends. and we, as adults, we pity this, so we pay for your treatments, for your oxygen machines. we give you food and water though you are unlikely to live long enough }
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{peter!}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{you are a side effect of an evolutionary process that cares little for individual lives.}
<C>__{van houten }
<D>__{you are a failed experiment in mutation.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{i resign!}
<A>__{lidewij has tears in her eyes. gus has balled his fists. but not hazel. van houten's words have not phased her one bit. she rises from the couch.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{hey listen douchepants. you're not gonna tell me anything i don't already know about illness. i need one thing and one thing only from you before i walk out of your life and that's for you to tell me what happens to your goddman characters!}

<D>__{i have resigned.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{oh don't be ridiculous.}

<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you're really not gonna tell us?}
<C>__{van houten}

<A>__{gus and hazel come out of the house, practically shaking. as they get to the street, van houten has one more thing to say.}

<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{go fuck yourself.}
<A>__{van houten doesn't have a response to that. he just shuts the door. and when he does, that's when hazel gets emotional.}

<P>__{(beat, an idea)}
<D>__{i will write you a sequel.}

<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{i'm so sorry. circumstance has made him cruel. i thought meeting you would help him, if he would see that his work has shaped real lives, but... i'm very sorry.}
<A>__{hazel says nothing. gus holds her in a very protective way.}
<C>__{lidewij}

<A>__{a video plays on a monitor showing the nazi invasion of holland. hazel and gus stand with lidewij in a pack of backpackers and travelers about to take the tour. many of them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{shall we?}
<A>__{hazel nods. both hazel and gus walk slowly up the stairs. so far so good. they find themselves in an office space.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{this is the bookcase that hid the frank family and four others.}
<A>__{the bookcase is half open. behind it is an even steeper set of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time. some of the travelers begin to walk up the stairs. gus looks at hazel are you sure we should continue? she begins the climb, determined. lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen tank. hazel moves very slowly. we are aware of her labored breathing the entire time. angle on other tourists, watching and quietly commenting. just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages. hazel arrives on the next floor an empty room. she's definitely starting to struggle. she leans against the wall to catch her breath. gus comes to her side, wipes her brow.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you're a champion.}
<A>__{hazel smiles. when she's feeling up to it they walk into the next room, also empty. and another staircase, even more narrow and steep practically a ladder. when gus sees this he looks at hazel:}

<D>__{that's enough }
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(resolute)}
<D>__{i'm ok.}
<A>__{hazel very slowly begins the climb. again we're aware of her every breath. it's dark. and it's becoming very difficult. near the top hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull herself through. once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the wall, trying to catch her breath. gus crouches next to her.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{we're at the top. that's it.}
<A>__{hazel becomes aware that tourists look at her with concern. she smiles, stands up, nothing to see here. and now they're in the final room a long, narrow hallway. this is where anne frank and 7 other people lived in hiding for as long as they could. there's a time line detailing their story.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{the only member of the whole family to survive was otto, anne's father.}
<A>__{gus takes hazel's hand.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{i don't know how you go on, without your family.}
<A>__{lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. gus leads hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a video details the last days of anne frank's life. over it, we hear a young girl's voice reading from the diary. the travelers stand to watch and listen. gus and hazel do the same. the room is dark.}
<C>__{girl's voice }
<D>__{"at such moment's, i don't think about the misery..."}
<A>__{gus and hazel stand very closely together. the video is the cherry on top of a very emotional day. hazel watches it.}
<C>__{girl's voice }
<D>__{"...but about the beauty that still remains."}
<A>__{gus, meanwhile, is just watching hazel, the same way she watched him on the airplane. after a beat, she catches him. their eyes meet. the emotions build...}
<C>__{girl's voice }
<D>__{"try to recapture the happiness within yourself. think of all the beauty in everything around you... and be happy."}
<A>__{and hazel kisses gus. a most passionate, intense, you and me against the world kind of kiss, better than any they've experienced or could even imagine. it seems to last for a small eternity. eventually, they break away and open their eyes. they quickly notice all the travelers staring at them. for a brief second, they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do... when suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the whole thing. one european even shouts "bravo!" hazel blushes, gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. cut to:}

<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{oh get over yourself.}
<A>__{hazel kisses him again. now he tries to pull her shirt off but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube. he can't figure it out. eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them. they shake their heads laughing certainly not your typical hollywood movie moment. and yet, for them:}

<D>__{i love you, augustus waters.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i love you too, hazel grace.}

<L>__{int hotel room morning}
<A>__{gus wakes up in the bed. he looks around for hazel but she isn't there. on the bed is a piece of paper. a note. it reads: "dearest augustus..." beneath that is a big circle, labeled "virgins." and in that circle is a smaller second circle labeled "17 year old dudes with one leg." we'll notice part of that circle is now outside the bigger circle. gus flashes that signature smile.}

<A>__{the place is filled today with mourners for augustus waters. hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back, watching people she's never seen before approach the waters family and extend their deepest condolences.}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{and this was it. the great and terrible ten.}
<A>__{when mr. and mrs. waters see hazel, they open their arms.}
<C>__{mrs. waters}
<D>__{he loved you so much.}
<A>__{hazel nods. hugs them back.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{he loved you so much too.}
<A>__{more mourners approach the family, leaving hazel stranded in the receiving line. her eyes turn towards the coffin. she's not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep breath, wills herself to walk towards it. gus is there in the same suit he wore to oranjee. immediately, hazel breaks down. and immediately, she catches herself.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{it's ok, you hear me? it's ok.}
<A>__{she leans forward and kisses his cheek. she looks around. once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of camel lights and sticks them in the space between gus and the lining of the coffin. a minister approaches at that moment.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{i think we're ready to begin.}
<A>__{hazel nods and walks back to her parents, taking her seat in the middle of the room.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{augustus waters fought hard for many years. his battle was a courageous one and his strength was a source of inspiration for each and every one of us...}
<A>__{hazel frowns. this is all such bullshit. and she hears:}
<C>__{male voice}
<D>__{what a load of shit, eh kid?}
<A>__{hazel recognizes that voice. but it doesn't make sense. she turns around and, sure enough, it's peter van houten.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{let us pray.}
<A>__{everyone clasps their hands, closes their eyes. hazel keeps staring at van houten, too shocked to do a thing.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{we need to fake pray now.}
<A>__{van houten bows his head. hazel, still stunned, slowly turns back to the minister, trying to make sense of this unexpected appearance.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{now i call on augustus's close friend isaac to say a few words.}
<A>__{isaac stands, walks up to the podium with someone's help. hazel sneaks one more look at van houten. yup, it's really him. that makes no sense to her. isaac starts to speak.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{of all the things i've lost in my life, this hurts the most.}
<A>__{and isaac stops talking. it's unclear if that was the end or if he just can't go on. he returns to his seat. the minister walks back up.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{and now we'll hear from gus's... special friend hazel lancaster.}
<A>__{hazel stands, walks up to the podium. a few titters in the room at the words "special friend."}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i was his girlfriend.}
<A>__{some laughter from the crowd. she takes out her notes.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{there's a beautiful quote in gus's home that reads "if you want the rainbow, you gotta deal with the rain."}
<A>__{hazel continues to speak but we over it, we hear instead:}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{i didn't believe a word, of course. but that was ok. funerals, i'd decided, aren't for the dead. they're for the living.}
<A>__{gus's parents, arm in arm, nod along with every word. cut to:}
<L>__{ext cemetary day}
<A>__{everyone is watching gus's body be lowered into the ground. everyone but hazel. she looks off into the distance. off to the side, we see van houten, also not watching the burial. he's watching hazel. cut to: later. ceremony over, we see hazel with her parents.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i will be fine.}
<C>__{frannie}
<D>__{are you sure? we can drive you }
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{no, i'd... i'd like to be alone for a while.}
<A>__{hazel hugs mom and dad, walks alone towards the parking lot. as she gets to the car, van houten approaches.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{could i hitch a ride?}
<A>__{hazel doesn't want to help this man.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{just to the bottom of the hill.}
<A>__{hazel exhales. fine. once they're both in the car:}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{how did you even }
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{the internet.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{and you just... bought a ticket?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{the drinks are free drinks in first class.}
<A>__{van houten removes a flask from his coat pocket. takes a swig. hazel shakes her head in disgust. starts driving.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{omnis cellula e cellula.}
<A>__{hazel ignores him.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{your boy waters and i corresponded quite a bit in his last }
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you read your fan mail now?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{i would hardly call him a fan. he despised me. but he was quite insistent i attend his funeral and tell you what became of anna and her mother. so here i am and that's your answer: omnis cellula e cellula.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i'm so not in the mood }
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{"life comes from life."}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{goodbye mr. van houten.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{you don't want an explanation?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{nope. thanks though. have a great life.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{you remind me of her.}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i remind a lot of people of a lot of people.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{she was eight, my daughter. she suffered... beautifully. for so long.}
<A>__{hazel starts to understand van houten and softens.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{she had leukemia? like anna?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{just like her, yes.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{were you married then?}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{not when she died, no. i was insufferable long before anna, my dear. grief doesn't change you, hazel, it reveals you.}
<A>__{hazel takes that in.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{well i'm sorry for your loss.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{and i'm sorry for yours. i'm sorry for everything, for being so rude to you two, for ruining your trip }
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you didn't ruin our trip, you asshole. we had an awesome trip.}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{hazel, i'm trying. i'm trying! you asked me to tell you what happens and i wish i could do that. i wish that i could. but i can't. no one can. no one knows, hazel. they don't talk to us. unless...}
<A>__{van houten takes out a typed piece of paper. he hands it to hazel who grabs it and immediately crumples it into a ball.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you think i care about that? i don't give a shit, van houten.}
<A>__{hazel throws the piece of paper at van houten.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you're a drunk and a jerk and a failure. and i'd like you to get out of my car right now so i can go home and grieve.}
<C>__{van houten}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{get out of the car!}
<A>__{van houten knows he's too late. he does as he's told, stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. he stands there as hazel peels out. in the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the flask, as if toasting her. she blinks away some tears and drives. cut to:}
<L>__{int hazel's living room day}
<A>__{hazel lies in front of the tv. "top model" is playing but she's lost in her own world. tears fall from her eyes and she can't do anything to stop it. hazel gets up.}

<A>__{hazel sits against the tub on the floor and weeps. soon there's a knock.}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(through tears)}
<D>__{occupada.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{can i come in?}
<A>__{hazel leans over and unlocks the door. michael kneels down next to her, putting her head on his shoulder. hazel presses her face into his shirt and cries some more. michael squeezes her tightly. and this time, he doesn't cry.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm so so sorry.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it was a privilege to love him, though, wasn't it?}
<A>__{hazel nods into his shirt. then looks up at her dad.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{gives you an idea how we feel about you.}
<A>__{michael smiles at hazel. and he doesn't cry. hazel draws strength from him.}
<L>__{ext isaac's house night}

<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{do you know if it hurt or whatever?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{he was really fighting for breath, i guess. he eventually went unconscious, but it seems like, yeah, it wasn't great or anything. dying sucks.}
<C>__{isaac}
<P>__{(long beat)}
<D>__{it just seems so impossible.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{happens all the time.}

<D>__{very.}

<D>__{did you read the note or whatever from your author friend?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{he is not my friend and how do you know about that?}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{we talked at the cemetery. said he came all this way to give you that.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{yeah well i'm over it. i never want to read another word of that asshole's again.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{yeah but he didn't write it gus did.}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{that's what he said. gus had written something, sent it to van houten }

<D>__{i... i have to go. i... are you...?}

<L>__{int exteriorhazel's car day}
<A>__{hazel is inside the car, rummaging crazily through the trash in an effort to find what van houten gave her. she's about to give up when she sees it crumpled up into a ball beneath the passenger's seat. she reaches under, pulls it up, and unwraps it. as she reads, we hear:}
<C>__{gus's voice}
<D>__{mr. van houten, i'm a good person but a shitty writer. you're a shitty person but a good writer. we'd make a good team. i don't want to ask you any favors but if you have the time, and from what i saw you have plenty, please fix this for me. it's a eulogy for hazel.}
<A>__{hazel is overcome with emotion.}
<C>__{gus's voice}
<D>__{she asked me to write one and i'm trying, i just, i could use a little flair. see the thing is... we all want to be remembered.}
<A>__{she smiles to herself, remembering: that first time gus and hazel ran into each other. the staring contest in support group.}
<C>__{gus's voice}
<D>__{we all want to leave a mark.}
<A>__{ driving (badly) in gus's car. their first kiss at the picnic by "funky bones."}
<C>__{gus's voice}
<D>__{but not hazel. hazel is different. hazel knows the truth. she didn't want a million admirers, she just wanted one. and she got it. maybe she wasn't loved widely but she was loved deeply. and isn't that more than most of us get?}
<A>__{ and back to hazel reading the letter, tears in her eyes.}

<A>__{gus takes her hand and holds it.}
<C>__{gus's voice}
<D>__{... but her hands were still her hands, still warm, and the nails painted this dark blue back color and i just held her hands and i willed myself to imagine a world without us and what a worthless world that would be.}
<A>__{ and back to hazel reading the letter. she never knew that story, never knew he was there. cut to:}
<L>__{ext hazel's house backyard later}
<A>__{hazel walks out to the grass behind her house, the oxygen tank dragging behind her. she lays down on the grass and looks up at the stars the same image that opened the movie.}
<C>__{gus's voice}
<D>__{she's so beautiful. you don't get tired of looking at her. you never worry if she's smarter than you cause you know she is. she's funny without ever being mean.}
<T>__{she remembers:}
<A>__{ the magical dinner at oranjee. the bench in which they sat overlooking the water. the passionate kiss in anne frank's house. falling onto the bed together. [all of these are images we saw at the beginning of the movie, only now, we see the oxygen tank, we see gus's leg, we see the fumbling and the difficulties etc. they don't make these images less beautiful. they make them twice as beautiful because they're real.]}
