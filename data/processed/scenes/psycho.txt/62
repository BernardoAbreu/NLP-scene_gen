<A>__{mary looks at him for a moment, then turns quickly, goes to the door, opens it and goes out onto the porch.}
<L>__{exterior the motel porch (night)}
<A>__{mary pauses outside the door, is about to start forward when norman comes round the building and walks along the porch, past the office, stopping only when he is close to her. he stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her eye.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i've caused you some trouble.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{mother...}
<P>__{(a hollow little laugh,}
<D>__{an attempt at sardonic}
<P>__{humor)}
<D>__{...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... i think that's it.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(looking at the tray)}
<D>__{you shouldn't have bothered. i really don't have that much of an appetite.}
<A>__{norman flinches, realizing she has heard his mother's reference to mary's appetite.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i wish... people could apologize for other people.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{don't worry about it.}
<P>__{(a warm smile)}
<D>__{but as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. huh?}
<A>__{she begins to back into her room. norman starts to follow, hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young woman and a motel room. bringing down the tray of food, in defiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his defiance for one day. he cannot go into mary's room.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it might be nicer... warmer in the office.}
<A>__{without waiting for approval or disapproval, he turns, hurries to the office. mary looks after him, her face showing amused sympathy, then follows.}
