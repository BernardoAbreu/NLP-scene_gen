<L>__{interior bathroom utah's apartment night}
<A>__{utah sits on the bathroom floor as tyler dabs betadyne antiseptic over his wounds. utah cringes.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{ouch.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{betadyne doesn't hurt.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{you're kneeling on my hand.}
<A>__{she laughs, shifts her weight and keeps tending him.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{so what'd the other guy look like?}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{never saw him, was your basic hit and run.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{but you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?}
<A>__{utah acts like he wants to say something but his mouth won't quite form the words. tyler dabs his face, touches a finger to his forehead.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{johnny, what is it with you? you have that look again, it's like you're about to tell me something and then you don't... or you can't. what's going on?}
<A>__{johnny searches her eyes. she stares at him, becoming fragile suddenly.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{what? what do you want to tell me?}
<A>__{utah's brow unfurls. the thought has passed. he slowly cups his hand over hers. gently pulling her close.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{i'm glad you pulled me out of the water that day...}
<A>__{he presses his lips to the smooth curve of her forehead. a kiss to each downcast eye. searching out her mouth with his own as his hands glide down the small of her back. their reflection in the mirror as utah slowly lowers tyler to the bathroom floor. she clings tightly in a breathless kiss.}
