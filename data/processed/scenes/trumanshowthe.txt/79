<L>__{interior conference room. day.}
<A>__{christof is in deep conversation with two executives. moses, a contemporary of christof but more jaded and debauched looking and roman, a fresh faced, younger man. chloe hovers in the background. a monitor, suspended from the ceiling shows a surveillance shot of truman and marlon pulling into a beach parking lot in marlon's van. the glass conference room looks out onto the vast control facility where simeon continues to call the shots, all too aware of the closed door discussion taking place in the background.}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(marveling, excitedly referring to truman on the monitor)}
<D>__{i can't believe how much he's shoved down. that he sensed the significance at aged seven and clung to it so fiercely.}
<A>__{roman paces, agitated, unimpressed. moses, mnore respectful.}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(gesturing to the clifftop on the}
<D>__{monitor pointedly excluding roman}
<P>__{from the conversation)}
<D>__{you remember, moses, it used to end right there, before the expansion.}
<C>__{roman}
<P>__{(unable to contain his anxiety any longer)}
<D>__{christof, the cracks are starting to show.}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(reassuring, keeping himself in check)}
<D>__{i will paper over them.}
<C>__{chloe}
<P>__{(coming to the defense of her mentor)}
<D>__{truman's had bouts of paranoia before and recovered.}
<C>__{roman}
<P>__{(adamant, faintly hysterical)}
<D>__{no, not like this. it's compromised. becoming unwatchable.}
<A>__{too much for christof. he wheels on the young man.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{fear? doubt?}
<A>__{is that what you have}
<D>__{trouble watching? perhaps you don't like watching yourself.}
<A>__{roman is stung into silence.}
<C>__{moses}
<P>__{(realizing his colleague is in}
<D>__{over his head, including chloe}
<P>__{to save roman's face)}
<D>__{why don't you two wait outside?}
<A>__{reluctantly roman and chloe exit and join simeon at the video wall.}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(instantly more comfortable in the company of a man his own age)}
<D>__{he's jumped the rails, moses, that's all. we'll get him back on.}
<C>__{moses}
<D>__{you know why they're so nervous. the birth of truman's child is going to double revenue. for god's sake don't let him upstage you.}
<P>__{(indicating simeon through the glass walls)}
<D>__{you've been grooming a successor.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{he's not ready.}
<C>__{moses}
<D>__{him or you?}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(jaw setting firm, referring to truman on the monitor)}
<D>__{you can't pull him back in without me.}
<P>__{(more reflective)}
<D>__{he's just acting out of character.}
<C>__{moses}
<D>__{what if he's in character? what if he's starting to act in character at last? have you ever considered that?}
