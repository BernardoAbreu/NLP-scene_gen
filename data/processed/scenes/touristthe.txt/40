<L>__{exterior bistro afternoon}
<A>__{cara and frank are seated. a bottle of orvieto rests on the table.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{do you think it's really over?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{maybe she'll change her mind. women do. she might give you a second chance.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i suppose that's a possibility.}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{that's what i tell my statistics class anyway; life is a game of chance. endless possibilities and permutations. you just have to calculate the odds.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{you haven't answered the question.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well...}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i'd like to think that love is a question of destiny, not chance...}
<A>__{cara looks at him curiously.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{for a moment there you just reminded me of somebody.}
<A>__{she shakes her head and takes a sip of wine.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{he had a way of dancing around a question so eloquently that you never noticed until later that he'd completely avoided the truth. his entire life was wrapped up in deception.}
<P>__{(lost in thought)}
<D>__{he told so many lies, i wouldn't believe him even if he finally did tell the truth.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he doesn't sound like much of a friend.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{he wasn't.}
<A>__{frank glances at her wrist.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{so why are you wearing his watch?}
<A>__{she looks up at him.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{you're smarter than you look, frank.}
<A>__{she runs her fingertip over the face of the watch. then, impulsively unclasps it and reaches for frank's hand.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{and you're right. here, take it.}
<A>__{she puts it on frank's wrist, over his protests.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what? no, i can't. this thing must be worth a fortune }
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{i insist. you're doing me a favor.}
<P>__{(firm)}
<D>__{take it or i will toss it in the ocean.}
<A>__{he hesitates. she means it. he closes the clasp.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i will wear it until you regain your senses.}
<A>__{he feels the heft of it on his wrist. admires it for a moment. it really is a beautiful watch. she settles back in her chair, pleased with herself. he looks up and sees her smiling at him.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{it suits you.}
<A>__{long shot of frank and cara framed by the sunset. a romantic dinner for two. they could easily be lovers or honeymooners... in the foreground reveal somebody watching them. the good looking englishman is there, hovering...}
