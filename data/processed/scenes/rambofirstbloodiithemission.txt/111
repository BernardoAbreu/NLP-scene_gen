<L>__{exterior ca river inlet}
<A>__{the sampan glides into the brackish estuary amid half submerged trees. it is the original rendezvous pointerior everyone assembles on deck, with rambo helping de fravio through the cabin door. brewer checks his watch.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{twenty five minutes. we'd better roll.}
<A>__{rambo freezes... looks down. an ak 47 muzzle is pressed into his kidney, held by one of kinh's men. two more are covering brewer, who had just handed his rifle to co, while donning his pack. kinh steps up, grinning. takes rambo's rifle. a fourth guard eases an arm around his neck, a long knife held under his jawline. it has all happened smoothly and with precision planning.}
<C>__{kinh}
<D>__{wa ky number ten. do ma.}
<C>__{de fravio}
<D>__{yeah, fuck your mama san, too. in the...}
<A>__{kinh backhands him to the deck.}
<B>__{tight on rambo}
<A>__{his eyes cold, looking at co. she advances on him. her black almond shaped eyes glitter, alien as the depths of space. she spits in his face. kinh snorts a feral laugh. rambo doesn't react.}
<B>__{e.c.u. co}
<A>__{her eyes dart to the side.}
<B>__{rambo and co}
<A>__{something, a microsecond flash of understanding, passes between them.}
<C>__{brewer}
<P>__{(enraged beyond belief)}
<D>__{you slope bitch!}
<A>__{she whirls on him, drawing the .45. it is enormous in her child's hand. her expression is terrifying.}
<B>__{she fires}
<A>__{the renegade behind brewer rockets backward, his face}
<B>__{exploding.}
<A>__{rambo moves, slapping his guard's elbow, driving the knife across and away. his teeth snap shut on the man's forearm. the knife falls. rambo's hands are simultaneously seizing the other guard's ak 47 just as he fires. rambo holds his hand on the man's trigger hand, aiming the gun. bullets rake from groin to face on the third man standing opposite them. he spins back, his rifle blasting away harmlessly into the sky. co places the muzzle of the .45 against kinh's temple. his grin is long gone.}
<B>__{she fires without hesitation.}
<A>__{rambo drives the butt of the second man's ak 47 into his stomach twice. the bandit lets go. firing blind over his shoulder, rambo vaporizes the head of his guard, whose hand he still grips viciously in his teeth. he releases the hand. almost like spitting out the dead man. clutching his stomach, the last bandit leaps to the shore. fifteen rounds from brewer's silenced mac 11 stutter quietly into him. he pitches face down in the mud. a cloud of blue cordite smoke disappears in silence. the whole thing lasted four seconds.}

<D>__{wow!}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{what just happened?}
<A>__{rambo moves over to co. she seems to sag, depleted. in shock. he takes the .45 from her limp fingers.}
