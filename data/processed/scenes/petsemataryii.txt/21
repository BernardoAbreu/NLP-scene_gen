<L>__{interior boarding area day}
<A>__{rows of kennels are stacked along the walls, smothered with cobwebs. ancient, rusted surgical equipment is scattered everywhere. the place is a mess. windows are boarded up and shadows cloak the room. over to the right, geoff hears a rustling. a cardboard box on one of the shelves jiggles. something is moving around inside it. geoff's eyes widen. still, morbid curiosity propels him forward. the box rustles again. he reaches for it and... a creature leaps out at him, howling. geoff screams and jumps back. the box tumbles over and... a cat crawls out. behind the protective mother, are four of the cutest kittens we've ever seen, mewing away. geoff sighs just as chase rushes into the room.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{what's wrong?!}
<C>__{geoff}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{nothing. i just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.}
<A>__{inside the box is a note. chase reaches for it. it reads: "and a warm welcome to you."}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{great, now i've opened an orphanage too.}
<A>__{one of the kittens pads out of the box and looks up at geoff with sleepy eyes. her fur is striped.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{well, i will take one. if it's okay...}
<A>__{geoff lifts the fragile creature, cradling it in his arms.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{she looks like a tiger.}
<A>__{chase spies an old broom resting in the corner.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{tell you what, you do some sweeping up here, and she's yours.}
<A>__{geoff nods and chase moves back out into the hallway. geoff sets the box back upright and lowers tiger in with the other kittens. he reaches for the broom and goes to work sweeping away the cobwebs. just as soon as he turns his back, tiger climbs the side of the box, spilling over onto the floor.}
