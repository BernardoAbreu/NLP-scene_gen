<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{jerk... what did you say?}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{i said, "everyone's going to die, jimmy. but drew's not going to die of aids. there's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."}
<A>__{miguel strokes andrew's hair.}

<D>__{you got that right, mikey...}

<D>__{you still believe that, don't you?}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{yes. i think it will be a simple solution. they'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. it'll neutralize the virus. it'll revitalize the immune system, and people with aids will become healthy again.}
