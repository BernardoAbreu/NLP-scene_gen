<D>__{and you did, love, you did.}
<A>__{she sits at the end of her bed and opens a box she has found in denis's cupboard. there is a programme from `the king and i' and a faded blue rosette from some long forgotten election campaign. a small flyer `margaret roberts. conservative candidate for dartford' and some childrens cards "to the world's greatest daddy love mark and carol."}
<D>__{margaret v o all i wanted was for my children to grow up well and be happy happier than i was certainly. and i wanted you to be happy of course. were you happy, denis? tell me the truth.}
<A>__{there is no response. margaret is momentarily lost in the room. then, seized by some compulsion, she begins to pull out the rest of his clothes, shoving them into black bags. as shirts and trousers go in, quick flashes of denis his youthful face, smiling at her at the opera. laughing on the beach in cornwall. at the door of number 10, smiling at her. sharing her bed. margaret looks up. denis's suitcase is on the bed. his coat and hat lying beside it. she folds his dressing gown the one from the bathroom hook tenderly and puts it on the top of the case.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{denis? denis?}
