<A>__{close on the rosin bag on the mound. a hand picks it up. puffs of rosin "smoke". nuke is on the mound. nuke nervously walks around the mound just before the first batter. he picks up the rosin bag. digs a slot for his lead foot to land. and crash approaches, in full gear, mask tipped up on his head.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{don't try to strike everybody out.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{strikeouts are boring. they're fascist. throw some ground balls, it's more democratic.}
<A>__{crash turns and heads to the plate and we hear the beginning of nuke's interior monologue.}
<C>__{nuke }
<D>__{what's this guy know, eh? if he's so great why's he been in the minors for ten years? and if he's so hot how come annie wants me instead of him.}
<A>__{crash turns around half way to the plate and returns to the mound, as if he knows everything nuke's thinking.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{and listen, meat. you don't know shit. if you want to get to the show, you'll listen to me. she only wants you 'cause she can boss you around, got it?}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and don't squeeze the ball so tight. it's an egg. hold it like an egg.}
<A>__{crash smiles and trots back to the plate. nuke's p.o.v. the first batter steps in. crash gives the sign for the pitch.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{fun? what's he know about fun?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why's he calling for a curveball? i wanta bring heat.}

<D>__{shake off the pitch. throw what you wanta.}
<A>__{nuke shakes off the pitch here comes crash back out to the mound before nuke's thrown a pitch.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{why you shaking me off?}

<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{but he ain't seen my heat }
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{awright, meat, give him your heat.}
<A>__{crash returns one more time to behind the plate. crash crosses the plate, past the hitter. he speaks to the opposing leadoff batter.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{fastball.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{why's he always call me "meat"? i'm the guy driving a porsche.}
<A>__{nuke winds up and delivers a fastball. the leadoff hitter tees off on the pitch and sends a line shot over the right field fence. close on billboard "hit cow, win steak" sign, the home run hits the cow on a target painted on the cow's rump. the cow's mouth opens and moos. the batter stands and watches the home run, admiring the shot, enjoying the moment. crash gets in his face instantly and gets very tough.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{what're you lookin' at?! you're showing up my pitcher, bush get your ass in gear!}
<A>__{the batter takes off on a home run trot slightly scared. and crash heads to the mound where nuke watches the mooing cow and the circling batter with dismay. crash smiles.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{well, i held it like an egg.}

<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{don't think. just throw. don't think. just throw.}
<A>__{nuke's windup and delivery a fastball. a powerful, clean, overwhelming fastball. strike one.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{god, that was beautiful. what'd i do?}
<A>__{nuke winds up and delivers his next pitch a monster. an ebby calvin "nuke" laloosh fastball. twenty feet wide of the plate. the bull mascot dives for cover the ball hits the bat rack. bats go flying.}
