<T>__{slow dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior dungeon chamber night}
<A>__{jamie remains strapped to the table, wrapped in bloody sheets. eyes closed. deathly still. suddenly an urgent, whispering voice pierces the darkness:}
<C>__{whispering voice }
<D>__{jamie? jamie?!}
<A>__{jamie startles awake to see the midwife frantically releasing her straps.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{come with me if you want to save your baby.}
<A>__{jamie can't believe her eyes. mary opens a threadbare knapsack revealing the baby inside! a soul shuddering rumble echoes throughout the cavern. jamie leaps up, eyes wide with fear, sensing the evil presence.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{oh, god ... he's coming!}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we've got to move. now!}
<A>__{pulsing with adrenaline, jamie harnesses the knapsack over her shoulders and follows mary out into the tunnels.}
<B>__{tunnel gate}
<A>__{chains grind over rusted pulleys. a massive iron gate rises, revealing a pair of filthy work boots. legs planted in bold stance as a tall, ominous shape begins to emerge.}
<B>__{another tunnel}
<A>__{the terrified midwife leads jamie with her baby on a breathless flight through the winding network of tunnels. haunted by the echoing sounds of the rising gate. stalking p.o.v. through tunnels gliding forward into the hollow catacombs. slow by determined. sensing the way.}
<B>__{another part of the tunnels}
<A>__{reaching a corner, mary stops and sends jamie off in the opposite direction.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{there! it's that way!}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{save your baby go now!}
<A>__{jamie runs, disappearing down the dark tunnel. mary quickly removes her shoes and tears off, now silent.}
<B>__{stalking p.o.v.}
<A>__{surges around a corner. finds mary. moves in on her.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{mary turns in small circles. fear mounting as she falters into darkness. heavy, labored breathing fills the tunnel. a mask the pale, neutral features of a man weirdly distorted by the rubber materialized out of the void right behind her. the shape! mary turns, about to scream when the shape lunges out, lifts her up by the nape of the neck and slams her forehead into a large metal spike jutting out from the cavern wall! leaving her impaled like a fish on a hook, the shape resumes its relentless pursuit. eerie under the lighted torches.}
<B>__{end of tunnel}
<A>__{jamie runs frantically. methodical, heavy footsteps behind her. she chances a look behind. the shape is coming! jamie vaults up a dark stairwell. a trap door above. it won't budge. jamie frantically pounds against the hatch. the shape mounts the stairs! strength fueled by sheer desperation, jamie forces the door open. tumbles onto muddy ground.}
