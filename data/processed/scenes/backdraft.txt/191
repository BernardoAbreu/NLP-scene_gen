<A>__{the weight of his equipment is pulling brian underwater. struggling against the insane swirls and the sheets of water still pouring down, brian unhooks his air tank. he leans back, tries to float on the rising column of water. his coat catches on something yanks him underwater. he struggles feverishly finally tears the coat off. the building groans in earnest. flaming chunks of plaster crash down around brian, forcing him to duck underwater. the place is coming apart. ten feet above, one of the falling chunks smacks a gas main, splitting then igniting it. a white hot jet of flame shoots from one side of the shaft to the other. brian's floating okay, he's floating right up into the flames. brian tries to flatten himself out, to keep everything but his nose below water, but he's still moving up the heat becoming so intense his face flares and he's ducking under water now, trying to stay alive, trying to decide whether to drown or burn when there's a crash. and suddenly another door on the shaft is tearing open. there's a glint of an axe. a flashlight. it's stephen. brian has about two seconds left. in that time stephen sees the shut off for the gas line mounted on the wall opposite. it's unreachable, a good twelve feet across a horizontal curtain of flame. before we can even assimilate that, stephen's already jumped. a crazy leap over the fire. he smacks the opposite wall, hits the shut off, and falls crashing into the pool beside brian.}
