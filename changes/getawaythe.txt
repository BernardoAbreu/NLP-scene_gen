<ACTION>__{CAROL IS STANDING IN A TICKET LINE THAT MOVES slowly foward. She struggles, clutching the heavy, money laden suitcase and her oversize purse between both arms. The line of ticket buyers moves forward .just fast enough to make it impractical to set the suitcase down. The station is ancient, vaultlike. Baggage lockers line the perimeter of the lobby and extend off into clumped rows within the wings of the station. CAROL APPROACHES THE TICKET WINDOW. She places the suitcase flush against the base of the counter and holds it tightly in place with one leg. Carol pops open her purse... a clumsy item in itself... as she lifts her wallet and the elderly ticket-seller looks across to her.}

<ACTION>__{Carol pays the tariff, places the tickets into her purse along with the change. Wearily, she labors the satchel back into her hand, then turns and begins to slowly walk down the seemingly acres-wide station promenade. NEAR A PORTICO WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY, Carol sits uncomfortably on a shiny wooden bench -- the suitcase rests on the floor pressed tightly between her ankles. She glances across the promenade walls, her eyes finding: A CLOCK READING: 9:40 ON A LOBBY BENCH - LATER CAROL STARES ACROSS THE ROOM at the scattering of passengers waiting on the wooden seats opposite from her. Carol's nervous boredom increases; she looks down at her lap, pretends to find something wrong with her nails and begins rubbing the cuticles. Carol finally rises impulsively from the bench, immediately reaching for the brown leather satchel. CAROL WALKS BACK DOWN THE PROMENADE while carrying   the suitcase. As other baggage-laden passengers scurry   around her, she looks across the arcade, her eyes finding   a glass- walled Cocktail Lounge. She hesitates, then begins   to trudge in that direction. A BANK OF LOCKERS STANDS NEAR THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE. As Carol approaches, an elderly WOMAN deposits a coin in one of the numbered lockers, opens the metal door and places a small suitcase inside. Closing and re-locking the door, the Woman quickly moves away. Having noted the woman and more than tired of hauling her burden around the station, Carol steps to the end locker, takes a quarter out of her purse, then studies the time scarred operating instructions on the face of the locker. She slips the quarter into the slot and opens the locker door. As Carol bends to pick up the suitcase, the locker door swings closed... She tries to open it but the door has re-locked itself... Carol quite disgusted with her predicament, again sets the suitcase down and pulls a quarter out of her change purse. As she again reads the numbered directions, a YOUNG MAN appears at her shoulder. THE MAN IS A PROTOTYPE OF URBAN SLEAZINESS, Doberman Pinscher features are broken by a weedybrown moustache, a cheap corduroy suit is set off by an oddly matched bow tie. The Man's appearance suggests a kind of drug store dapperness.}
