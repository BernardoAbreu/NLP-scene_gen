<A>__{bursts of gunfire from three m 16s shatter our ears... and a ceiling vent. wesker and the others jump down into... ...a very unusual corridor. it seems to stretch forever, in both directions. it has no doors, no visible means of exit or entry. the walls are made up of multi colored polymer tiles, whose irregular shapes fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. the floor is heavy steel, though faceted. it seem designed to shift. the whole corridor looks like it might be able to bend, to change position, like an airport jet way. there are disconcerting signs of damage...claw like gouges on the tiles, clean cut holes punched through the metal ceiling, larger in diameter than any that might have been caused by bullets. and there are smears of blood everywhere, as if some terrible battle... or battles...took place here.}

<D>__{maybe not. and how do we know it's only going to be twenty minutes? how do we know we'll be able to come back this way?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{we don't. but we'll do our damndest to try. this is it, guys. the home stretch. let's go.}

<D>__{on the clock! fall in!}
<A>__{jill wrestles with her emotions but, in the end, dutifully, she "falls in". as the troopers move off, we hear odd scratching sounds... with the high pitched squeal of metal on metal.}
