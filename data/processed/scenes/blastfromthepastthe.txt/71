<L>__{interiorshelter, living room very early morning}
<A>__{super: the present the room is quiet and empty. the star burst wall clock on the paneling says 6:15.}
<L>__{interior shelter, kitchen same time}
<A>__{also empty.}
<L>__{interior storeroom same time}
<A>__{also empty. and with meager supplies on the shelves.}
<L>__{interior power and pump room same time}
<A>__{the old pipes are rusted and patched. some are leaking badly.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom same time}
<A>__{calvin wakes up. he looks over at helen's bed. angle helen she wakes up. then jumps out of bed. scene 67 }
<B>__{close on the red metal box}
<A>__{that has been ticking on the wall for thirty five years. suddenly it stops ticking and a rather annoying alarm goes off. calvin's hand reaches up and turns it off by throwing the lever up. another angle shows us the mechanism on the front hatchway switch to open with a loud, vault like move.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{reveals the family in their pajamas standing in front of the front hatchway and red box.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{so...we just open this door and go up?}
<A>__{calvin grabs a handle and using all his strength, opens the front entrance hatch. and then must jump back when nothing but earth and rock pour into the room.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{um...is that supposed to happen?}
<A>__{his parents take a beat then race off like maniacs through the entire shelter to the back hatch door. they knock over whatever gets in their way as they go. adam follows.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{hey, where are we going?! is everything all right?!}
