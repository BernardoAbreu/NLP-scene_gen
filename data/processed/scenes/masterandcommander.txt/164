<L>__{166. the great cabin day}
<A>__{the officers take their places at dinner. once again it's penguin stew. pullings comes in, with an unexpected smile on his face and whispers something to jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{praise be. at last.}
<A>__{the others seem to know what's going on, all except stephen who looks baffled.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{pray what is there to celebrate?}
<A>__{jack holds up his hand for silence. a series of creaks and groans from the ship. the coffee pot tilts on its gimbals.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we have made our turn northward, doctor. we are headed back toward the sun...}
<A>__{the officers give a slightly ragged cheer.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{...in anticipation of which. i asked killick to prepare something special.}
<P>__{(shouts off)}
<D>__{killick. killick there.}
<A>__{killick comes in with his usual exasperated expression, bearing a tray with a silver tureen lid on it.}
<C>__{killick}
<D>__{which i was just coming.}
<A>__{he lays it on the table.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{gentlemen, i give you... our destination.}
<A>__{he whips off the lid to reveal a strange glutinous mass, a pudding cut in the oddest of shapes. everyone stands to get a better look.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{the galapagos islands.}
<C>__{pullings}
<D>__{'pon my word so it is. look: here's narborough, chatham and hood...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that's where the whalers are, ain't it mr allen. so that's where the acheron will be headed.}
<A>__{the mood is now taken over by the glee of recognition, as the officers marvel over the pudding.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{mr. pullings, if you'll permit me, a slice of albermale. for you doctor, redondo rock.}
<A>__{there's a tiny man of war made of icing, between the islands. jack picks it up in his spoon.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{and, with a fair wind behind us the acheron for me.}
