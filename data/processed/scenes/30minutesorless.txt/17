<L>__{exterior nice house day}
<A>__{dwayne and jay head out, passing a brand new pickup truck in the driveway. dwayne spits on it.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{fuck the major!}
<A>__{the guys get in a shitty ford aerostar minivan and peel out.}
<L>__{interior dive strip club day}
<A>__{r. kelly's "ignition (remix)" pumps. large, fake breasts, sparkling with cheap body glitter and pierced at the nipples, shake before us. their owner, juicy (27), a petite latina, phones in a lap dance as dwayne pours his heart out to her. somewhere in the background, jay hangs at the bar, all alone.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{ and he thinks he knows me. he don't know shit. i got ideas he could never dream of. i got plans bigger than his fucking house.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he didn't even raise me. my mother did. that was a good woman.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{oh yeah? what happened to her?}
<A>__{dwayne shifts, uncomfortably, at the sore subject.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{she passed on.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{i hope you're not one of those guys that comes here looking to get mothered.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i wouldn't mind nursing on them titties, mamacita.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{sure. whatever you say. maybe just keep quiet for a while, forget about your old man and let me do my thing.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i wish i could forget about that asshole for good. i'm just waiting around for him to drop dead. don't wanna mess with my inheritance.}
<A>__{this piques juicy's interest.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{what kinda inheritance?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{when my dad got outta the service, he started buying lotto tickets. he'd play his dog tag numbers. in '91, the fucker won five million bucks.}
<A>__{insert photo: the major holding a giant cardboard check.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{he had some health problems a few years back, and since then he's been burning through the money like an nba draft pick. probably only got a million or two left. but it's mine as soon as he kicks.}
<A>__{behind inch long fake eyelashes, juicy's shrewd eyes narrow, mind working. she straddles dwayne, tightly.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{you know, with a million bucks, you could have anything. be like a king.}
<P>__{(almost a moan)}
<D>__{king dwayne.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{that's right. and maybe i will make you my queen. let you polish my royal scepter.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{practice makes perfect.}
<A>__{juicy pantomimes a long, slow chicken head. dwayne is blissed out. she smiles at him, sticky sweet.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{let me ask you a question...do you really hate your daddy?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{hate him like the steelers.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{then maybe i can help you get that money now. before he spends another penny.}
<A>__{dwayne looks confused. juicy puts his hands on her breasts, emboldening him.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{i know a guy in baltimore. he could help you out. probably do it for...}
<P>__{(sizing him up)}
<D>__{...100gs.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{do what?}
<A>__{juicy leans in, whispers softly in dwayne's ear }
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{kill your mean old dad.}
<A>__{on dwayne's face as this new possibility pinballs around his mind, setting off a flood of different emotions.}
<C>__{juicy}
<D>__{so, what do you think...you ready for your crown?}
