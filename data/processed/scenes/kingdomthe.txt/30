<L>__{exterior al rahmah housing compound blast sites evening}
<A>__{the shattered softball diamond and parking lot. emergency lights swirl from everywhere. acrid smoke. francis manner (fbi legat, us embassy) is giant. the kind of american that only grows in tiny southern hamlets. military whitewalls, short sleeves, khaki dockers, a thick casio g shock, fbi credentials visible on a chain. hangs up his phone. lifts his eyes: hell from one side of the frame to the other. saudi teams setting up portable lights that bathe the horror in industrial incandescent. columns of black smoke. fleets of emergency vehicles. 100 uniformed men. another 200 in bio suits combing the ball field, the parking lot. fran has to do something anything. move through the horror with him now. his hands shake, his face already dirty with soot. jumps in with a saudi team pulling a half burned woman out of a smoldering range rover. she fights them, gouging fran's face, trying to get back in. she is the woman we met at the gate of the compound. she wants her baby. fran bloodied, just kind of steps away from the woman. leaves the saudi emergency team to fight with her. backs away until he feels grass under his feet. the woman's screams reverberate. fran just sits in the grass. staring at the woman, her shattered soul. forces himself to look away. eyes come to rest on a child's baseball cap: ragged holes ringed with black stains: where blood dried on the blue felt.}

<D>__{you gotta stand, big man.}
<A>__{fran does. wipes his hands on his pants. slack jaw hopeless. the first moments in what will be weeks of reverse engineering the murders of unknown dozens. he and rex step to a group of walking wounded. a neighbor doles out mugs of coffee. most everyone from the compound is out, pondering the proximity. saudi emergency teams sprint past. fran spits, settles in:}

<A>__{something huge explodes over their shoulders, 50 yards away. the attack's coup de grace: wait for people to lift up their heads, hit them again. five times the size of the suicide bombs. shreds emergency vehicles, nearby homes and apartment buildings. kills saudi rescuers by the bushel. fran is crushed by a flying portable light standard. rex is blown into the man handing out coffee. the walking wounded get decimated.}
