<A>__{ackerman and his team approach, guns drawn. undercover agents converge as well, closing the perimeter.}
<L>__{interior alexander's villa, penthouse night}
<A>__{frank and cara sit in the middle of the room amongst a sea of broken glass. just getting over the shock of being alive.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<A>__{cara nods. she looks at him for a long moment, then breaks out into a smile.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{i did well to choose you on the train...}
<A>__{frank's turn to smile. he looks around the room at the carnage.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you didn't get to arrest alexander pearce...}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{he never showed up.}
<A>__{frank slides closer to her. gently, carefully, he slips his hands into cara's cleavage. surprised, cara starts to pull back but he puts a finger to her lips. she hesitates... looks at him questioningly. but she doesn't protest as his fingers move toward her bra... ...and grasp the tiny microphone. with a sharp tug, he rips it free. he tosses it across the room. then he leans a little closer and whispers in her ear:}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(a british accent)}
<D>__{you're wrong. i'm here.}
<A>__{she straightens up. her heart skips a beat.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{it's me. i'm here.}
<A>__{she covers her mouth. her eyes mist over with tears. she runs her fingers over his face with loving amazement. like a blind person trying to recognize a familiar face. her mind reels... then their lips meet. they kiss. and kiss. like drinking from a fresh spring in the desert. finally she pulls away and looks at him.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you said i'd told so many lies, you wouldn't believe me even if i did tell the truth... this was the only way to convince you.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{the truth is that i love you. all that matters is that you believe me.}
<A>__{she stares into his eyes for a beat. finally looking at her without a trace of deception. she believes. they hear voices on the stairs below. frank holds up a finger to her wait. frank crawls across the room and presses a hidden latch on a built in bookshelf. it swings out of the way to reveal a hidden safe built into the floor. frank removes the fitted floor boards. there is a sophisticated bio metric lock just like the one at the gate in the beginning of the movie. frank places his finger on the spot and the lock clicks open.}
