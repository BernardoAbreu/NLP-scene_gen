<B>__{the city landscape}
<A>__{tron arrives at the city, gazing around an empty, surreal, burnt out landscape. buildings seem two dimensional, barely there, at a low rate of power, so drained by the mcp. the cycle de rezzes. there's a noise from above, and tron looks up. tron's pov a recognizer floats over the city, moving towards him.}
<L>__{exterior city landscape}
<A>__{he hides behind a building as the reco passes. a strange, zombie like figure comes down one of the streets, and the recognizer swoops over it, the static field flashing between the legs, passing through the figure, dissolving it. close up tron's face very grim. he looks out onto the street and sees two more of the figures, standing together, staring at each other, barely moving. dead, lifeless, but animate. tron comes out on the street, staring at these figures. he locks around the city in confusion, shaking his head sadly, but walks on.}
<B>__{tron turns a corner}
<A>__{up ahead we see a large, multi storied factory like building. close up tron is face this is what he was looking for. he looks from side to side, figuring the best way to get to the building. in front of the building stand a small group of the memory guards.}
