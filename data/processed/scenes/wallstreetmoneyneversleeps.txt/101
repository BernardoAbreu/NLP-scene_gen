<L>__{interior jacob's apartment night}
<A>__{lcd reads 4:43 am. jacob lays awake... staring at the ceiling.}
<C>__{winnie }
<D>__{i would hear him in the kitchen.}
<A>__{jacob turns to see she's awake.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm sorry, you have an early train. i'm going to just go to the office now.}
<A>__{she leans up.}
<C>__{winnie}
<D>__{he didn't want to keep my mother awake so he'd go into the kitchen and sit there. i could hear him because my room was right up the back stairs. i'd go and sit with him sometimes. we'd eat ice cream.}
<A>__{jacob gets out of bed and throws on his robe.}
<C>__{winnie }
<D>__{i was only eight but i could tell he was worried about something and that made me worried.}
<P>__{(softly, almost to herself)}
<D>__{then the market would go back up and he would sleep through the night again.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it's not the market, winnie.}
<A>__{as he sits on the edge of the bed...}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{it's just that i haven't been able to sleep through the night since...}
<A>__{the thought trails off... she leans up and kisses him.}
<C>__{winnie}
<D>__{i wish i could tell you something was going to come along that would make it better but i can't. it's just going to take time, jacob. a lot of time.}
<A>__{and she looks into his eyes...}
<C>__{winnie }
<D>__{have you been counting fridays?}
<A>__{he slowly nods.}
<C>__{winnie }
<D>__{i still count tuesdays.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{all seven hundred and twenty eight of them.}
<A>__{he leans over and kisses her forehead.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{go back to sleep.}
<A>__{and he goes... after a beat, she sees jacob's wallet.}
<C>__{winnie}
<P>__{(calling out after him)}
<D>__{jacob, you forgot...}
<A>__{she jumps out of bed, grabs the wallet and goes after him, but... it opens up and winnie notices the picture inside. and she stops, staring at that picture. her and her father on that white horse... taken years ago. a picture she knows she never gave to jacob.}
