<L>__{interior the tabernacle}
<A>__{in the central area with the ark, shliemann and the other nazis wait impatiently, eyeing the ark with some discomfort. belloq is not visible, because at the moment he is in the folds of the tabernacle, the silk of the tents undulating around him. the light is even stranger, the scene almost dreamlike. with the help of the tall captain, belloq lets an extraordinary, gold embroidered, ceremonial robe fall over his head and onto his body. belloq looks transported, possessed. the tall captain unlatches a wooden case and takes from it a sturdy ivory rod about 5 feet long, elaborately engraved. belloq takes it from him, turns and slips back through the silk. the tall captain stays in the folds. back in the central area, shliemann and the other nazis are taken aback by belloq's appearance in the robe. they exchange looks. from one knot of men there is muttering about "juden" and such, but when belloq turns a fiery gaze on them there is immediate silence. shliemann looks uncertain in this presence. belloq approaches the ark. he stops a few feet from it and begins murmuring an invocation in hebrew. after a few moments of this he advances a step and is about to place the ivory rod in a notch under the lid of the ark itself. the end of the rod is an inch from the notch when indy steps into the tabernacle. on his shoulder is a bazooka and it is aimed directly at the ark.}

<D>__{hold it.}
<P>__{(the nazi react)}
<D>__{one move from anybody and i blow that box back to moses.}
<A>__{shliemann makes it clear to the other nazis that indy is to be obeyed.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{jones, your persistence surprises even me. you are going to give mercenaries a bad name.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{what about you? talked to god yet?}
<P>__{(belloq's eyes flash)}
<D>__{where's the girl?}
<C>__{shliemann}
<D>__{doctor jones, surely you don't think you can escape from this base.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{that depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. all i want is the girl. we'll keep possession of the ark only till we've got safe transport to england. then it's all yours.}
<C>__{shliemann}
<D>__{if we refuse?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{then the ark and some of us are going up in a big bang. i don't think hitler would like that a bit. now i don't want to talk about this anymore. show me that girl in five seconds or }
<A>__{the tall captain flies out of the silk and takes indy down by the neck. the bazooka clatters across the cement floor as two other nazis help subdue indy. the three nazis take indy's pistol from his holster and raise him roughly in their grasp.}
<C>__{shliemann}
<D>__{jones, this is the second time i have seen you looking very foolish.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{it's a bad habit. i'm trying to break it.}
<A>__{shliemann draws his luger.}
<C>__{shliemann}
<D>__{i will help you. this time i will kill you myself.}
<A>__{shliemann raises the pistol.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{no! not in the presence of the ark! take him outside.}
<A>__{shliemann eyes belloq, then the ark. he lowers the pistol, motions for the nazis to take indy out ahead of him. they stop a moment only when belloq speaks.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{indiana jones, i salute you. i am even a little sorry you will miss this moment.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{thanks. if you talk to him, tell him i'm on my way up.}
<A>__{shliemann motions them out and follows. belloq turns back to the ark, raising the ivory rod.}
