<A>__{seq. 1600 croods get shoes}
<L>__{exterior coral fields morning}
<A>__{the croods trudge behind grug as he cautiously makes his way to the mountain. grug sniffs, and tests the ground he moves like a man in a mine field. meaning slowly.}
<C>__{the log}
<A>__{eep walks alongside guy, who is still being carried by grug in the log.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{that was too close. it almost caught us.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{i was watching. we were fine.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{we've got to move faster. do you people have any other speed aside from "wander?" i will take a shamble at this pointerior}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{hey, do you have a minute? how did the tiger fly?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i only share when i'm outside the log. i'm funny that way.}
<C>__{eep}
<P>__{(winking)}
<D>__{leave this to me.}
<A>__{eep falls back behind thunk, getting him between she and her dad.}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{hey thunk, you have a spider on your face.}
<A>__{eep smashes thunk in the face, knocking him into grug, sending guy and the log flying. grug shoots eep an annoyed look.}
<C>__{eep }
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{oops.}
<A>__{grug sees guy has rolled away.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{he's loose!}
<A>__{grug goes to retrieve guy, and steps on something sharp.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{aaaaahhhhhh! do not step on those weird, pointy rocks!}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{you mean these rocks? ahh owww! do not step on these rocks!}
<A>__{thunk steps on the coral it crunches under his feet.}
<C>__{gran}
<D>__{step aside, girls!}
<A>__{gran steps out, and then screams.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{hello? nobody's listening! no one is listening. you cannot walk on those!}
<A>__{guy stands on the coral without flinching.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{arraughrragh come back here now.}
<C>__{gran}
<D>__{well, there goes our chance for survival.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{and our log!}
<A>__{grug must make the choice to go after guy.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{okay. arraugh!}
<A>__{grug cringes and bellows with every step. guy still locked inside the log, hops away as fast as he can. grug leaps out and grabs the log only to loosen it as guy jumps to a coral patch below.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{ow, ow, ow.}
<A>__{guy now free runs and hides behind a giant shell. he looks back at the croods as they try in vain to cross the field and feels pity for eep.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{ow! jumping doesn't help, i mean, just briefly, but it doesn't get better! ow! do not walk on your hands, the hands do not help at all.}
<A>__{guy looks back at the stranded croods. then he looks again to the tall mountain. belt sees that guy is having a hard time leaving the croods. he needs to make a choice. belt makes it for him.}
<C>__{belt}
<D>__{eeccoomme on!}
<A>__{belt walks guy back to the croods}
