<A>__{four empty pilot seats are seen in f.g., the four glass caskets in b.g. we hear the rhythmic bleat of a warning signal, a rush of wind as in a rapid descent, and perhaps the roar of retrojets. then, a great crash as the craft hits water. the whole ship shudders on impact. loose equipment falls to the cabin floor. camera moves down the cabin aisle as the ship begins to roll in the water and holds on the four glass caskets. there are three loud metallic clicks as the glass domes of the caskets swing open automatically.}
