<A>__{we see charlie full face. behind him is a confessional booth. the church is very old, quiet, and dark. the camera zooms out to reveal rows of holy candles lit in the foreground. charlie suddenly begins to speak softly and confidentially to an unseen entity that is off screen.}

<P>__{(confession)}
<D>__{a...as you know, i've just come out of confession. and as a penance they gave me ten 'hail marys' and ten 'our fathers'...}
<B>__{the camera begins to truck out. it moves around charlie and}
<A>__{away from the holy candles revealing charlie's profile.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...now, between you and me... you know how i feel about such things... 'hail marys'...'our fathers'...no imagination...}
<A>__{the camera has now trucked behind charlie and we see over his head he has been addressing a life sized statue of the crucified body of christ, eyes closed reclining in his sepluchure.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...if i'm going to do penance at all, i will do it the way i think it would be done...by me, that is...according to my own trespasses. you know what i mean.}
<A>__{this conversation of confession will occur from time to time in other parts of the story as charlie will periodically try very casually to justify his thoughts and actions to his "god." the images accompanying these monologues are to be of free association almost documentary in nature.}
