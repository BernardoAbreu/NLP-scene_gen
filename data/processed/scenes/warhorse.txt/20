<L>__{interior stables. day.}
<A>__{albert washes joey and tends the wounds and sores on his body. rosie is putting antiseptic on albert's wrists and shoulders. joey bristles but is soothed by albert's care.}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{you're as battered and bloodied as he is.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{and where's dad?}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{still in the bottom field.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{stumbling about, i suppose.}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{it's not the drink, albert, that makes him stumble }
<C>__{albert}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{he drinks, mum.}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{well, so might you if you'd been where he's been, seen what he's seen!}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{well, he don't talk to me about it.}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{he don't talk about it because he can't. there aren't words for some things. come here...}
<A>__{rosie stalks over to a pile of broken equipment in a corner of the stables. she rummages until she finds a waterstained brown paper parcel tied with yarn. she brushes away some mouse turds.}
<C>__{rosie }
<D>__{the mice've been at it. sit down.}
<A>__{they sit together on a step. as she begins to untie the yarn, a change comes over her: her irritated determination gives way to sadness. albert comes to her and kneels beside her as she gently opens the paper. inside there's a red and tan pennant, knotted and fringed at both ends.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{here. it's his campaign pennant. he were sergeant, seventh battalion, imperial yeomanry.}
<A>__{then with great care she unfolds the sash to reveal two silver medals. the first, with the profile of victoria, hangs from a red, blue and orange ribbon.}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{and that is the queen's south africa medal. every man who fought in the boer war got one of those. but this...}
<A>__{she holds up the other medal, hanging from a red and black ribbon.}
<C>__{rosie }
<D>__{that's the distinguished conduct medal.}
<A>__{she hands albert the distinguished conduct medal. he takes it, astonished.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{not dad's?}
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{well it ain't mine, dear. he got that after the fighting at transvaal. after he'd been hurt, and he'd saved some other lads, and well... i don't know what else, he won't tell me either. but the first day he got home he just... tossed them out. first day he could walk, he threw `em straight in the dustbin, and wouldn't hear a word i said not to.}
<A>__{albert nods, looking at the medal and campaign pennant. she takes the medal back, puts it in the sash, and begins to wrap it again.}
<C>__{rosie }
<D>__{see, what you done today, you and joey, you're chuffed up now, and so you should be, my splendid boy. it's good to be proud when you done something good. but what he done, in africa, whatever it was, he takes no pride in it. hard as it surely was, and however much pain it's cost him, he refuses to be proud of killing, i suppose.}
<A>__{she returns the things in the footlocker, closes it.}
<C>__{albert}
<P>__{(confused:)}
<D>__{i'd be proud. if i'd gone off to war. if i'd gone and saved my mates, and }
<C>__{rosie}
<D>__{well, whether or not you think you'd do the same thing as him... think how brave he is for refusing to be proud.}
<A>__{she heads back to albert, pennant in hand.}
<C>__{rosie }
<D>__{oh, your dad makes mistakes. and he drinks to forget the mistakes that he's made but he never gave up and he does that for us. and today, you showed the world it's all been worth it.}
<A>__{as she leaves, she drapes the pennant over albert's shoulder.}
<C>__{rosie }
<D>__{you keep looking after joey and he'll always be looking after you.}
<A>__{albert looks again at the pennant.}
<C>__{albert}
<P>__{(softly:)}
<D>__{sergeant, seventh battalion, imperial yeomanry.}
<P>__{(amazed, to joey:)}
<D>__{you see this, joey? it's been through an entire war.}
<A>__{albert holds the pennant in wonder.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{i'm not stealing it. i will give it back to him, someday.}
