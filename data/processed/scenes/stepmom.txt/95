<L>__{interior bar night}
<A>__{the dimly chic bar. with its soft upscale buzz. where jackie told luke she had cancer. tonight, she waits alone. watching the entrance. nursing her drink. and then... ...rachel comes into the place. spots jackie across the room. weaves her way through the tables. and she is there. slipping into her seat. not knowing what to say.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{thanks for coming out.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{neutral ground. what's up?}
<A>__{jackie stares evenly. her chin rests across the back of her knuckles. she looks tired, but okay. fueled by adrenaline.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{luke called. he says you're checking out. of the heartbreak hotel.}
<A>__{the waitress appears. rachel too locked into the moment to notice. so...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{she likes a stolie, no ice.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{double.}
<A>__{as the woman leaves...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what's this about? because we fought ?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{don't flatter yourself.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i always liked that line.}
<A>__{signs.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i love luke, i love the children. but there is more to life than even love...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{no, there isn't.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and i have looked down the road. at what my life will be. and i can't handle it.}
<A>__{jackie unblinking. focused, strong.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what do you see? down that road.}
<A>__{no answer. then...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i never wanted to be a mom. then, sharing it with you was one thing. carrying it alone, the rest of my life...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{is scary. but you want it. gimme some truth here.}
<A>__{the stolie arrives. they wait a beat. the waitress disappears.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{well, it's the jack kennedy syndrome, huh? you die young, you always look golden. perfect. the memory kind of burnishes the image, and...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{come on, a wuss like me? the stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{maybe i was wrong on that one.}
<A>__{that sits there. in its sincerity.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{well, maybe you weren't.}
<A>__{and so does that. tears are forming in rachel's eyes. here, in this public place.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{look, when i said i couldn't channel you. that didn't mean i wouldn't give my right arm to do just that.}
<A>__{shakes her head.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{maybe i don't want to be looking over my shoulder. every day for twenty years. knowing someone else would have done it right. the way i can't.}
<A>__{jackie waits. thinks.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{trade you a smoke. for a secret.}
<A>__{the way she said that. something weighty behind it. so rachel reaches into her purse.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you know, i lost ben awhile back? in a supermarket.}
<A>__{rachel's hand freezes. in mid course.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you're lying.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i lost him. i was panicked.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 seconds , you could find him from a coma , there is no way!}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off. doing my imitation of you.}
<A>__{rachel still not buying...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{ben never mentioned it.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{he only remembers i found him. my point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing i could ever have done for you.}
<A>__{the smile fades.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{why didn't i?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{uh. you hate my guts?}
<A>__{passing the cigarettes over.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{we were competing. even then.}
<A>__{yes we were.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{instead of being partners. watch ing each other's back. seeing things were covered.}
<A>__{pulls out a smoke. offers the pack...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you're not scared you'll think you don't measure up. you're scared they'll think it. that's the jfk thing, yeh?}
<A>__{rachel takes one. eye contact holding.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{with good reason. they fucking worship you as it is.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what do i have that you don't?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{everything. you're...the earth mother incarnate...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you're the hip and fresh.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you ride with annabelle...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you'll learn.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's happiness has been wrapped up in you , every moment...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i have their past.}
<A>__{strikes the match.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you. have their future.}
<A>__{rachel stunned. by the simplicity of it all. slowly, she leans to accept jackie's flame.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{don't you get it? you look down the road to her wedding. you're in the room alone with her, fitting her veil, fluffing her dress. telling her no woman was ever that beautiful.}
<A>__{tears now. standing in two pairs of eyes.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{and your fear is. she'll be thinking. i wish mom were here.}
<A>__{jackie lights her own.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{and mine is. she won't.}
<A>__{her hand trembles as she takes a drag.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{now that's enough fear for either one of us to kill the other. and no jury in the world would convict.}
<A>__{jackie raises her glass.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{we're guilty, girl. of being human. and we can't forgive ourselves.}
<A>__{holds it forward. in a toast.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{but i forgive you.}
<A>__{and slowly, rachel lifts her own glass. clicks it with jackie's.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{don't rush me. i'm deciding.}
