<L>__{interior simone & viktor's office day}
<A>__{viktor leans on his desk, still reflecting on lainey's remarks. jane enters.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{ready for your casting session?}
<A>__{viktor nods distractedly. jane shows in nicola anders.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{nicola's here for the role of simone's sister.}
<A>__{viktor offers nicola a seat, staring at her as if he has never truly looked at her before she has a quality of simone.}
<C>__{nicola}
<P>__{(slightly uncomfortable by viktor's scrutiny)}
<D>__{a lot's happened since we last saw each other.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(numb)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{nicola}
<D>__{i never apologized properly for what happened on "sunrise".}
<A>__{she hands viktor a peace offering a large jar of mike & ike candy, including cherry.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{thank you. it's not important.}
<C>__{nicola}
<D>__{after i saw what simone did with the role you know i fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look. she really inspired me.}
<A>__{viktor continues to stare.}
<C>__{nicola}
<P>__{(referring to the script in her hands)}
<D>__{would you like me to read?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{yes, i'd like that.}
<A>__{nicola glances at the script a last time and puts it down. she approaches viktor, standing close to him, playing the scene to him an immediate intimacy.}
<C>__{nicola}
<P>__{(her angry words are in}
<D>__{opposition to her amorous}
<P>__{actions)}
<D>__{ who do you think you are, carlos coming in here like this? with my husband sleeping in the next room. do you think i won't call out? do you think i will just give in to you without a fight like the last time and the time before that?}
<P>__{(she kisses his ear)}
<D>__{i wish you were dead.}
<P>__{(she kisses his lips)}
<D>__{i wish we were both dead.}
<A>__{nicola immediately breaks character. viktor is mesmerized he has fallen back in love with flesh.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(finally able to speak)}
<D>__{you know you're really very good. i take back what i said. i mean, you're really good.}
<C>__{nicola}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(forgetting himself)}
<D>__{you could play the lead.}
<C>__{nicola}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{but that's simone's part.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{yes, of course it is.}
<P>__{(gazing at her face)}
<D>__{you know you have a line here. not a wrinkle. actually, more of a dimple. i've been thinking of incorporating something like that in simone.}
<C>__{nicola}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{you'd cosmetically alter simone to look like me?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{no, of course not, you're right. that would be crazy.}
<A>__{viktor sits back down and stares out of the window.}
<C>__{nicola}
<D>__{do you want me to do it again?}
<A>__{viktor does not reply. nicola quietly leaves.}
