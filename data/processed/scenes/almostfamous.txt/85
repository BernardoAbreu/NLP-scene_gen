<L>__{interior bus night}
<A>__{russell sits, pale, next to penny at the front of the bus. he examines his singed hand, shaking it a little to emphasize the positivity of her words.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{don't worry. it's happened to all the greats. thank god you didn't hold the mike stand with both hands, you'd still be holding it. this is a good thing. it's a good, good, good thing.}
<A>__{william sits nearby, watching russell, making notes out of eye sight of others. the ever wary jeff, unseen by william, cranes to see that he's writing in his notebook. dick swings into the seat across from russell. the bus door shuts, as the promoter is still yelling. doris is slow to gain speed, as estrella appears, running alongside. she knocks on the window next to william.}
<C>__{estrella}
<D>__{i forgot to tell you! your mom says to call home immediately. she says she knows what's going on!}
<P>__{(receding)}
<D>__{see you guys in topeka! i will catch a ride with sabbath!}
<A>__{william nods with embarrassment, waves to her, as the bus races toward the now closing gate.}
<C>__{dick}
<P>__{(casually, to russell)}
<D>__{wanna buy a gate?}
<A>__{before russell can answer bash. doris barrels through the steel gate, snapping it like a chopstick to great cheers inside this bus.}
<C>__{dick }
<D>__{you just bought a gate.}
<P>__{(to the bus)}
<D>__{c'mon doris!! get us out of town!!}
<A>__{the bus struggles up a slight incline, everybody rooting for doris, as she eases out of the parking lot and onto a thoroughfare.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{what did it feel like to be electrocuted?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{it burns. it feels like a dose of lead shooting through your body... and then you see god, and he says, "how bad do you want to be legendary?" and god damnit.}
<A>__{i let go.}
<P>__{(shaky grin as all laugh warmly)}
<D>__{rock and roll.}
<A>__{jeff watches this charisma with thinly veiled envy. the kid scribbles in his notebook. we hear led zeppelin's "that's the way."}
