<L>__{exterior middle of nowhere day}
<A>__{we are indeed in the middle of nowhere, no nothing as far as you can see. we continue to crane up, a $140,000 ferrari modena flies down the road in a cloud of suspended gravel toward stanley's dilapidated, piece o' crap trailer.}
<L>__{exterior trailer roof day}
<A>__{stan stands on the roof of his trailer, which was a dilapidated shack in the 1950s and now is a lot worse. a chained but scruffy looking rottweiler runs around in front of the trailer. stan looks completely different than he did in the opening sequence. he hasn't taken very good care of himself. his hair is long, and right now standing on end. he is wearing nothing but a dirty towel, and is slicing golf balls off the roof. whack. as the ferrari drives up he begins hitting golf balls at it, but he just isn't very good. nevertheless, after a dozen bad hits, a lucky shot ricochets off the aluminum hood. closeup ferrari hood clang!}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{stan smiles as the car slides to a halt in the gravel driveway, and turns back to his "work."}
<B>__{angle on stanley}
<A>__{as we hear the door shut and someone comes up the aluminum extension ladder. a few moments later, in slow motion, ginger appears at the top of the ladder and steps onto the trailer's roof. stan turns around. she is what the hack writers of the thirties would call a vision. thesauruses could be exhausted searching for adjectives that do her justice. in the low rent light of stanley's white trash haven, she is, by definition, a goddess.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{who are you supposed to be?}
<A>__{whack (slice). she lights a cigarette, inhales deeply, then exhales.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{hello, stanley.}
<A>__{she knows his name.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{i'm ginger.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{is that right?}
<A>__{whack (slice).}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{for someone the n.s.a. has listed as the most dangerous hacker in america, you sure don't look like much.}
<A>__{whack (slice).}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{don't look so surprised. i know everything there is to know about you, stan. from your mom's maiden name to how big your...}
<A>__{she glances downward then back up.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{bank account is.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{how'd you get past my dog?}
<C>__{ginger}
<P>__{(cute)}
<D>__{boys like me.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{great. what are you selling again?}
<A>__{whack (slice).}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{did i say i was selling something? i'm here to help you, stan. look at you, you're a mess.}
<A>__{whack (slice).}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{my employer wants to meet you.}
<A>__{whack (slice).}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{you're not very good at this, are you?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{you're fucking up my chi.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{can i see that?}
<A>__{begrudgingly he hands her the club. she tees up a ball, pulls up her skirt far enough to reveal thong, and whack, hits a ball that tiger woods would envy. clang. she smiles, hands him the club back and pulls down her skirt.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{you need to straighten your left arm. you're bending it.}
<A>__{he looks at her.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{trust me.}
<A>__{he does and the ball goes flying 200 yards, perfect, whacking a fridge with "200 yards" painted on it. clang! stan looks at the club, then tosses it to the ground, climbing back down an aluminum extension ladder that leads up through a makeshift hatch on the roof.}
