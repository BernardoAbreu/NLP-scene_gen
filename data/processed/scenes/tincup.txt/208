<L>__{exterior eighteenth fairway day}
<A>__{tin cup in the fairway, studying his shot.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{so birdie wins it.}
<A>__{he looks at simms, ten yards across the fairway from him.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{you or me, dave?}
<A>__{simms points to himself. he has a wood in his hands, but he puts the club back and reaches for an iron. tin cup edges closer to romeo.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{he's laying up. birdie to tie, eagle to win, and that gutless wonder's laying up.}
<C>__{romeo}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{par to tie, birdie to win... you lay up too, roy. you can make birdie laying up.}
<A>__{they watch simms lay up. then romeo offers tin cup an iron, hoping he'll take it.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{you know something, romeo? eagle puts me ten under. no one's ever finished an open ten under, not even nicklaus.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you don't need an eagle. birdie wins, par ties.}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{hit the lay up. hole a wedge for goddamn eagle.}
<A>__{tin cup throws some grass in the air, looks back at the green, the gallery, the whole grand setting... and he seeks out molly's face in the crowd. he moves over so she can hear him.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{this is everything, ain't it? this is the choice it comes down to. this is our immortality...}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{no time to be thinkin' 'immortality,' cup... time to be thinkin' 7 iron.}
<A>__{molly stands with doreen, hearing tin cup's words. thrilled and terrified and spellbound, she finds herself nodding. doreen, on the other is turning ash white.}
<C>__{doreen}
<D>__{oh no. this is what always happens. he's going for it.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{go for it!}
<C>__{doreen}
<D>__{no! he just needs par to tie! tell him to lay up! he listens to you!}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{go for it, roy! knock it on!}
<C>__{doreen}
<D>__{this is why we split up he always went for it...}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{my problem is i've never been with a man who went for it...}
<C>__{doreen}
<D>__{well, honey, he's your guy.}
<B>__{back to tin cup}
<A>__{he selects the three wood. romeo sighs.}
