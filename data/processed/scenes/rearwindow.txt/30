<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day close shot}
<A>__{the camera is very low at one end of the divan. jeff's head, half buried in the sheet, is large in the fore ground. beyond him stella looms large and powerful looking.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i think you're right. there is going to be some trouble around here.}
<A>__{stella takes a handful of oil, slaps it on his back. he winces.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{i knew it!}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{don't you ever heat that stuff up.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{gives your circulation something to fight.}
<P>__{(begins massaging his back)}
<D>__{what kind of trouble?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{lisa fremont.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{you must be kidding. a beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{she expects me to marry her.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{that's normal.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i don't want to.}
<C>__{stella}
<P>__{(slaps cold oils on him)}
<D>__{that's abnormal.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(wincing)}
<D>__{i'm not ready for marriage.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{nonsense. a man is always ready for marriage with the right girl. and lisa fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(indifferent)}
<D>__{she's all right.}
<A>__{she hits him with some more cold oil. he winces again.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.}
<P>__{(peers at him)}
<D>__{what is it? you have a fight?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{stella}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{her father loading up the shotgun?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{stella!}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{it's happened before, you know! some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{she's just not the girl for me.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{she's only perfect.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{too perfect. too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything but what i want.}
<C>__{stella}
<P>__{(cautiously)}
<D>__{is what you want something you can discuss?}
<A>__{jeff gives an exasperated look.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{it's very simple. she belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of park avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{people with sense can belong wherever they're put.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?}
<P>__{(almost to himself)}
<D>__{if only she was ordinary.}
<A>__{stella sprinkles powder on his back, spreads it around. the camera pulls back as she helps jeff to a sitting position. he buttons on his shirt.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{you're never going to marry?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{probably. but when i do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. i need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.}
<A>__{the camera moves in as she helps him into the wheelchair, listening to him with exaggerated attention. he, stops as he notice her attitude. then he goes on with less conviction:}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{the only honest thing to do is call it off. let her look for somebody else.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{i can just hear you now. "get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! you're too good for me!"}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(after pause)}
<D>__{that's the hard part.}
<A>__{she swings him around in front of the window. he starts to look out.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{look, mr. jefferies. i'm not educated. i'm not even sophisticated. but i can tell you this when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other they should come together wham like two taxies on broadway. not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{there's an intelligent way to approach marriage.}
<C>__{stella}
<P>__{(scoffing)}
<D>__{intelligence! nothing has caused the human race more trouble. modern marriage!}
<A>__{jeff swings his chair back to look at her.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{we've progressed emotionally in }
<C>__{stella}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{baloney! once it was see somebody, get excited, get married now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{people have different emotional levels that }
<C>__{stella}
<P>__{(interrupting again)}
<D>__{ask for trouble and you get it. why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. then he refused to marry her. why? because she only scored sixty one on a look magazine marriage quiz!}
<A>__{jeff can't help smiling.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{when i married myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. we still are. and we've loved every minute of it.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{that's fine, stella. now would you make me a sandwich?}
<A>__{she relaxes.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{okay but i'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. lisa fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. i will give you two words of advice. marry her.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{she pay you much?}
<A>__{stella leaves for the kitchen in a huff. jeff turns his chair to the window.}
