<L>__{interior rubber rose outhouse day}
<A>__{the outhouse radio is playing "the starving armenians polka" and bonanza jellybean and delores del ruby are in the privy, caught in the rain.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{well, i'm not scared of a little rain.}
<C>__{delores}
<D>__{me neither.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{might as well brave it.}
<C>__{delores}
<D>__{right. i don't know about you but i'm sure not sweet enough to melt.}
<A>__{delores flicks her whip at a sweat bee that has taken refuge in the privy and hits the photograph of dale evans upon which it has lit. jelly looks out the door of the outhouse across a cut green lawn to a bunkhouse where we can see a gathering of other cowgirls. there is a fly buzz and a distant polka yip. way off horse lips flutter. bonanza spies a picture of sissy hankshaw, an advertisement for yoni yum dew spray mist, on the privy wall.}

<P>__{(musing)}
<D>__{someday...... if that sissy hankshaw ever shows up here, i'm gonna teach her how to hypnotize a chicken. chickens are the easiest critters on earth to hypnotize. if you can look a chicken in the eyes for tens seconds, it's yours forever.}
