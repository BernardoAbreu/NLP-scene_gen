<L>__{exterior parking lot (pine view) early evening}
<A>__{bethlehem relaxes with his officers as wagons are loaded. michael is just passing with a sack of grain on his shoulder, when bethlehem looks across the street spies abby and some of the other women sewing grain sacks shut.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{good lord. that, gentlemen, is a first rate piece of ass.}
<A>__{michael overhears. he looks over as bethlehem's men nod in agreement. michael sees that they're talking about abby.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{tell the sheriff i want to be introduced. she does not belong in a mudhole like this.}
<A>__{one of the men hurries off. it's concern for abby, not for his manhood that makes him step forward.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<P>__{(looks over)}
<D>__{you again?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that's my wife, general. she's a married woman.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{do you know what system of government we have here, son?}
<P>__{(as michael shrugs)}
<D>__{a feudal system. like the middle ages. with lords and vassals. that's you and me. those lords, they had some ideas. if a vassal got married, it was the lord's right, his right, to sleep with the bride on the wedding night.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{me and abby have been married for three years.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{sorry, but i wasn't invited to the wedding. now, you've already done me one favor, son. don't let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record.}
<B>__{abby}
<A>__{another woman has pointed out to her what's going on. she can't hear what's being said, but she watches, concerned.}
<B>__{parking lot}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{we'll be civilized about this. i want you to give me your blessing.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{sir, i can't. you can't.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{can't? i'm tired of can't. we had a great nation once. do you know what made it that way? i can! till the weak came along. the 'i can'ts' destroyed us. but i'm going to make us strong again. i'm going to be the father of a new nation.}
<P>__{(draws his sword)}
<D>__{do you know why it will be me?}
<A>__{michael looks to abby as she starts across the street.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{because i can!}
<A>__{the sword whistles down. accompanied by an anguished cry:}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{michael!}
<A>__{abby rushes forward, but she's blocked by getty and another man. she cries out again and again. filled with impotent fury, briscoe squeezes out the words.}
<C>__{briscoe}
<D>__{you didn't have to }
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{didn't have to what, sheriff?}
<A>__{three holnist soldiers draw down on briscoe. bethlehem circles, menacing on his horse.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{your people seem seditious. you seem seditious.}
<A>__{briscoe stares down at michael's crumpled form. abby wails.}
<C>__{briscoe}
<D>__{aw, michael...}
<A>__{briscoe might go after bethlehem despite the odds.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{what am i seeing here? i'm waiting.}
<C>__{briscoe}
<P>__{(burying his anger)}
<D>__{man came through here. with mail. said he was a postman. said the government had been restored back east.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{what government?}
<A>__{from out of the crowd a voice. ford.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{the united states government.}
<A>__{bethlehem whirls his horse at the noise.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{who said that?}
<A>__{not waiting for an answer, getty charges the crowd, knocks one of the onlookers down. a dead silence. bethlehem frowns, thinks it over a minute.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{which way did he go?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{do not make me ask again.}
<C>__{briscoe}
<P>__{(lies)}
<D>__{east.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<P>__{(to getty)}
<D>__{send a patrol east. send three more south, north and west.}
<P>__{(to briscoe)}
<D>__{they'd better find him east.}
