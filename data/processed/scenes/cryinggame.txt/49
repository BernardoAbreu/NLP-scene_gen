<L>__{exterior metro night.}
<A>__{fergus, standing across the road from the pub. he is sweating. dil comes out of the pub. she looks this way and that, as if searching for fergus. fergus stands back into a shadow. dave, the burly man, comes out. he grabs her by the elbow. she shrugs him off. she walks off. dave follows, grabs her by the elbow again. the sense of an old argument. dave suddenly strikes her across the face with his open palm. she leans her head against a wall. dave then puts his arms around her, consoles her.}
