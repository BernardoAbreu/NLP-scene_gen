<A>__{no one says anything, and then lieutenant glaser, 30, speaks up.}
<C>__{lieutenant glaser}
<D>__{he's found a room he's going to sit it out.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{yeah, except for holding a gun to senator malcolm's goddman head in his own goddman house last night, anderson's sitting it out!}

<C>__{witwer}

<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{he's going to do what it takes to stay free if it blinds him, maims him, or kills him.}
