<ACTION>__{We FADE IN : on the block of stores (Quick Stop/RST), from sometime ago, In fact, RST isn't RST; it's THE RECORD RACK -- a 45's store with head shop paraphernalia in the window. A white-trash MOTHER (maybe seventeen) wearing a baseball cap comes into frame carrying a chubby BABY. The Baby wears an oversized t-shirt under what looks like a little bathrobe, and messily eats a CHOCOLATE BAR. There are food stamps in the Mother's hands.}

With the backwards baseball cap and the chocolate around his mouth forming something that resembles a beard, the kid looks kind of familiar. Then, another MOTHER (also very young) decked out in a KISS concert shirt from years gone by and huge, feathered hair enters, with a black skullcap wearing BABY slung at her hip. She sees the first Baby, sitting against the wall and sets her Baby down beside him.}

<DIAL>__{Why the fuck would you do a thing like that?}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(reading)}
<DIAL>__{"Bluntman and Chronic and their stupid alter egos Jay and Silent Bob only work in small doses, if at all. They don't deserve their own movie."}

<DIAL>__{Who the fuck said that shit?!}
<CHAR>__{HOLDEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A guy who calls himself "Magnolia- Fan."  Check out what the guy after him said: "Jay and Silent Bob are terrible, one-note jokes that only stoners laugh at.  They're fucking clown shoes. If they were real, I'd beat the shit out of them for being so stupid. I can't believe Miramax would have anything to so with this shit. I, for one, will be boycotting this movie. Who's with me?"}

<CHAR>__{HOLDEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{JAY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But they said Jay and Silent Bob! They used our real names. It doesn't matter that there's a comic book version of us and a real version, 'cause nobody knows we're real in real life.}
<CHAR>__{HOLDEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Really.}
<CHAR>__{JAY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah! And all these people who read that shit think the real Jay and Silent Bob are a couple of faggots 'cause of that all these dicks are writing about the comic book Jay and Silent Bob!

And she'll be like, "Oh--I read on the Internet that youse guys were little fucking jerkoffs."  And then she goes and sucks two other guys's dicks off instead! Well fuck that!  We gotta put a stop to these hateful sonsa- bitches before they ruin our good names!}
<CHAR>__{HOLDEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{First off, I don't know how good your names really are. Secondly, there's not much you can do about stopping this bile. The Internet's given everyone in America a voice, and everyone in American has chosen to use that voice to bitch about movies. As long as there's a Bluntman and Chronic movie, the Net-nerds are gonna have something negative to say about it.  Jay steams, thinking. Then, a light dawns on him.}
<CHAR>__{JAY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{HOLDEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, and kiss-off the hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties you're due in the process. Are you fucking retarded? Look, I'm probably not alone in the opinion that this flick is the worst idea since Greedo shooting first. I mean, a Jay and Silent Bob movie? Who would pay to see that?}
