<A>__{...it falls with a clatter of pages. he reaches with his right hand, replaces the pad on his thigh. around him, cameras are being swung to the ready. ishmael looks to see... ...a slender woman of refined beauty, entering the courtroom. a few flashes pop, and ishmael's right hand retrieves a venerable box camera from beneath his seat, as his notepad falls once more, unheeded.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{hatsue miyamoto had been without her husband for 77 days.}
<A>__{ishmael pivots, and we understand his struggle with the notepad. for he is forced to rest his camera on the stump of his amputated left arm, its empty sleeve pinned at the elbow.}

<D>__{he was in jail. when his baby son learned to walk.}
<A>__{through his viewfinder, we see hatsue take her place in the first row. and sensing her presence, her husband turns. their eyes meet. a string of flashes... but none from ishmael. he hesitates. as if considering whether he will violate this woman's privacy. the camera lowers. hold on his face...}

<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{earlier, i noticed her in the corridor.}
<A>__{pull back to see him alone, in shadow. it is more than a notice. ishmael stares with fixed intensity at the motionless woman, as she gathers her thoughts. a moment of decision. he approaches. stops, respectfully, at a distance which will not invade her personal space. and softer than we might have imagined...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{are you all right?}

<D>__{and you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.}

<D>__{nossir. i'd gone to tell the wid... to tell mrs. heine.}
<A>__{and his glance inevitably goes to the first row behind the prosecutor's table. taking the glances of the jury with it. susan marie heine is pretty and blonde and full bodied in her modest black dress. composure and dignity. against her grief.}

<C>__{moran}
<D>__{that's...}

<C>__{moran}
<D>__{carl died last night. in a fishing accident. in white sand bay.}

<D>__{no, carl's fine, h...}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{we found him, mrs. heine. tangled in his net.}
<A>__{and with these words, a slack, blank look crosses her face, and she stumbles back one step, sitting down hard on the bottom stair of her curved staircase. he doesn't know what to do. she digs her elbows into her lap, and begins to rock, very slowly, wringing the diaper in her hands. her face is more terrible than tears. it is frightened. she murmurs to herself, so that we can barely hear...}
<C>__{susan marie}
<D>__{i told him this could happen.}
<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{close on hooks, nodding. as if, slowly, digesting something in his mind.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{so, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{these are fishermen, alvin. they don't talk at all to each other and less to me. specially gossip.}

<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{a gill netter works through black nights with only himself to talk to. and learns to be silent. they were lonely men and products of geography.}

<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{...men who, on occasion, realized that they wished to speak, but couldn't.}
<A>__{as he arrives, moran smiles a thin greeting. not happy to see him. of course, neither is anyone else.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{figure you'da heard by now.}
<A>__{ishmael shakes his head in silent helplessness. william gjovaag, a sunburned, big bellied, tattooed gill netter, clamps on his damp cigar butt.}
<C>__{gjovaag}
<D>__{you go fishing, it happens.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{you see susan marie?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{i did. boy.}

<C>__{moran }
<D>__{only to see if somebody talked to him out th...}

<D>__{so who talked to him? out there.}
<A>__{staring. at each other. eye contact holds during...}
<C>__{jan sorensen }

<C>__{moran}
<D>__{all right, look, if you see these boys...}
<C>__{gjovaag}
<D>__{never saw you so hard ass, art. ain't this just an accident?}
<A>__{moran finds his eyes drifting to ishmael's. which are right there, waiting. moran looks away.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{course it is, but a man's dead, william. i got to write my report.}
<A>__{angle...ishmael and moran, walking alone back up the wharf. the sheriff is worried. finally...}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{i'm not gonna see some article about an investigation, am i?}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{you want me to lie?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{no, i wanna be off the damn record, that's what i want.}
<A>__{no answer. they keep walking.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{i mean, if there is a killer, why would you want him all alerted?}
<A>__{silence. silence. and slowly...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{let's say...someday i need some cooperation from you on this thing. do i get it?}
<A>__{and looks over. like the guy holding all the aces.}
<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{moran fidgets on the stand.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{no sign of a struggle, you say.}
<A>__{see him now. nels gudmundsson, attorney for kabuo miyamoto, stands beside his impassive client. nels is 79, blind in his left eye, a little shaky. his body is winding down.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{well, the coffee cup was layin' right in the middle of the floor, like i said. and with a fella so neat as carl, that did seem peculiar.}
<A>__{and nels begins to walk toward him. limping, as he comes.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{as peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a single overturned cup in its wake?}
<C>__{hooks }
<D>__{objection, asking the witness to speculate.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{my gosh, alvin, was i supposed to object every time you did that?}
<A>__{a real. friendly smile.}
<C>__{judge }
<D>__{that's quite enough horseplay, nels, why don't you act your age?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{if i did that your honor, i'd be dead.}
<A>__{some gentle laughter. judge fielding doesn't even bother to look annoyed.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{any more homely loveable tricks, and you'll be worse than that. proceed, gentlemen.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{there's an objection, your h...}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{and it's overruled, answer the question. if you can recall it.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{maybe the assailant straightened the cabin. and forgot the cup.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{right. in the middle. of the floor.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{nels nods to himself, as if considering that. so that the jury will do the same.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{i think you testified all the lights were on. cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{and yet you started the engine right up. with all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge. did that strike you odd?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{didn't think about it at the time. so no, it didn't strike me odd.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{does it now?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{a little. yes. you have to wonder.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you have to wonder.}
<A>__{and lets that sit. scratches his neck.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you found three batteries, you say. a d 6 and d 8 in the well. and a spare d 8 on the cabin floor. correct?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{it is.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{now i did some measuring down at the chandlery. a d 6 is one inch wider than a d 8. it would be too large for the deceased's well.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{he's done some on the spot refit ting. you could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the d 6.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{but he had a spare d 6, you said. right there. why not use that?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{it was dead. we had it tested. maybe the d 6 was the spare and he had to use it.}
<A>__{ah.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{maybe he carried a spare that was too large to fit. so he'd have to bang out the flange to squeeze it in?}
<A>__{no answer to that. the silence rests.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on defendant's boat?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{two d 6's. that's the kind his well was fitted for.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{no spare.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{so the defendant went out fishing for the night with no spare battery, hmmn?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{apparently.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{i'm curious. the d 6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{i believe so.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.}
<A>__{stops. thinking.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you don't. think so.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{he was heavy, but we were real careful. but i don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you don't. remember .}
<A>__{and clears his throat.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it possible . possible that he struck his head after death. possible?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{possible. but not darn likely.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{no further questions.}
<A>__{and limps back to the defendant's table. where kabuo miyamoto sits watching him.}
<L>__{interior courtroom later}
<A>__{horace whaley, the county coroner, folds his stork like limbs uncomfortably. searching for the appearance of ease.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{he said, 'could it be somebody hit him?' and i said, 'you want to play sherlock holmes, here?'}
<A>__{shakes his head, with a wry, disgusted smile.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{did you say more?}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{i said that if i was playing sherlock holmes...i'd maybe look for a... japanese person. with a bloody gun butt. a right handed fella, to be precise.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{and why. is that?}
<A>__{slight shrug.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{well, i was a doctor in the jap theater, in the war. i saw those kendo wounds, many times. looked exactly like this one.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{could you tell me what 'kendo' is?}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{japanese stick fighting. they're trained as kids, y'know. to kill with sticks.}
<A>__{and the prosecutor's eyes drift to the defendant. so that the jury's will do the same. hold on kabuo's regal bearing. his neutral mask.}
<C>__{hooks }
<D>__{no further questions.}
<L>__{exterior strawberry fields dawn}

<A>__{whaley stares down the end of his needle nose. the air of disdain of a man playing chess with an unworthy opponent.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{so this...foam you found in the lungs. how does it get there?}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{as i testified. it occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration. i believe i said that.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{but a drowned person can't breathe.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{of course not. the foam means that he went in breathing.}
<A>__{ah.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{that's why the autopsy report identifies drowning as the cause of death.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{your report says death by drowning , which means he went into the water alive and breathing. and the report is accurate...?}
<C>__{whaley }
<D>__{of course it's accurate, but...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{of course, it is. now as to the head injury. you say made by an object narrow and flat. that is your inference , correct?}
<C>__{whaley }
<D>__{it's my job to infer, that's what coroners do. you get hit with a crowbar, or a ball peen hammer, or fall off a motorcycle, the injuries look different, that's my area of expertise.}
<A>__{nels nods. he can be quiet now. the witness distracted from volunteering the opinions nels did not wish for.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{in your motorcycle example. those injuries are produced by the head being propelled against an object. rather than the reverse, yes?}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{obviously.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around? or would both look the same.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{the same.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{so if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{if the head was moving fast enough, but i don't see how it could be.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{is it possible?}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{sure, anything's poss...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{is it fair to say that you do not know for certain which it was.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{i already said that, b...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{and that you can't say for certain whether the head injury was sustained before or after death?}

<D>__{highlight was crowning the strawberry princess. always a japanese girl, sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice to the concept of racial harmony.}

<D>__{he's still got a good grip. we need to dig more.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{at school, she kept mostly to the japanese kids, and sort of ignored me. as if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.}
<A>__{they are digging now, together. carefully.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i told myself that was good. that it made our friendship special. and didn't mean she was ashamed of it. necessarily.}

<A>__{she lifts it clear. and as she admires its size and roughness with her fingertips. as she washes it in the shallows. he watches her movements.}

<D>__{it might be a mistake. i could never correct.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i like you.}

<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{do you know what i mean, hatsue? i've always liked you.}
<A>__{there is no answer. he leans slightly closer, and she looks down. this is the moment. afraid and driven, he moves slowly to her face. and puts his mouth against hers. she lets him and, encouraged, he pushes harder, making hatsue... ...lose her balance, and planting a hand beneath the water to support herself, eyes closed too tightly, she kisses ishmael for a long moment, before... ...leaping up, snatching her clam pail and running away down the beach like a deer. he stands slowly. to watch her go.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i knew in my heart that we would love each other forever.}

<D>__{so this way, i could see her without...bothering anyone.}

<D>__{by two weeks, i knew i had made the defining mistake of my life.}

<D>__{i'd ruined everything.}

<D>__{i'm sorry i kissed you on the beach.}
<A>__{no reaction. as if she hasn't heard. now his heart is beating straight through his chest.}

<D>__{me neither.}
<A>__{she turns her face to him, and offers a small smile. it is genuine, and therefore dazzling to the boy. she lies back on the ground. her eyes so unafraid and direct.}

<D>__{do you think this is wrong?}
<A>__{he swallows. staring at her lying there so comfortably.}

<D>__{i did a terrible thing, ishmael. i knew what you felt. and what i didn't.}
<A>__{sadness in her voice. but strength as well.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{and i never found the courage to tell you.}
<A>__{his eyes swim with tears. he chokes them back, he has to.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{you'll think this is crazy, but all i want is to hold you. just once. and smell your hair.}
<A>__{she absorbs this. no sign of repulsion or anger. her eyes seem wise. and very sad.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{you have to hear this, i can never touch you, ishmael. not once, not ever. there's no half way. as much as i know it hurts you, you have to let this go.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{look, i want to forget you, i do. i think if you hold me, just this once, i can walk away and never speak to you again.}
<A>__{she just keeps looking at him. there is a bravery to her steady gaze. her calm resolve.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{please? as one human being to another, just because i'm miserable and don't know where to turn. i need to be in your arms. if it's just for thirty seconds.}

<A>__{she rises slowly. brushes the sand from her skirt.}

<D>__{to hold you would be wrong and deceitful. you're going to have to live without holding me, that is the truth of the way things are.}

<C>__{nels}
<D>__{but carl didn't say yes.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{he didn't say no. that was kabuo's pointerior given how carl's mother felt, carl was still willing to consider selling to us. it was a good sign.}

<C>__{nels}
<D>__{well, in the week that followed, the week before carl's death... did your husband pursue him?}
<C>__{hatsue}

<C>__{hatsue}

<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{right there, on the boat, they agreed. $8400 for the seven acres, $800 down. they shook on it. kabuo was so excited when he came home.}

<D>__{and when did you first learn. that carl had drowned?}

<C>__{hatsue}

<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{happy for him. and relieved.}
<C>__{hooks}

<P>__{hatsue (calm, respectful)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{really? didn't call your mother, your sisters, about starting a new life. your husband never tells his brothers that the family honor is vindicated.}

<C>__{hooks}

<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{closer to eight.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{so, five hours. plenty of time for a call. he was 'excited', you say. in the sense of being 'overjoyed'.}
<A>__{she nods, he was.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{we are...cautious people. you would say conservative. there would be time for celebrating with others when a paper was signed.}
<A>__{hooks pouts. he allows himself that.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{you thought the deceased might... break his promise?}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{of course not. we're just not quick to run and boast. in case something went wrong.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{and then, something did. carl heine was found dead. with his head crushed.}
<A>__{she weathers that last part. as if taking no notice.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{yes, and then, what was there to call about? everything was up in the air.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{up in the air? was that your reaction?}
<A>__{and he rises. tastefully indignant.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i would suggest that more happened than a land sale evaporating. a man died , mrs. miyamoto. a husband and father of small children had his skull bashed in!}
<C>__{hatsue }
<D>__{if you mean to imply that we were callous about carl's death, that is wrong and insulting.}
<C>__{hooks}

<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{we discussed that. and decided not to.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{she looks at him with the directness we've seen before.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{but if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?}
<A>__{her eyes cut to nels. he smiles, to blunt the harm she's done by looking to him for support. her gaze goes down now. and then... ...back up. straight to hooks.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{trials aren't only about truth, mr. hooks. even though they should be. they're about what people believe is true.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{so you hid the truth. deliberately.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{we were afraid. silence seemed better. to come forward seemed like a mistake.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{well, it seems to me...}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{objection. mr. hooks can give his view in his summation.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{doesn't it seem to you , mrs. miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful? concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{it seems human. to me.}
<A>__{oh. hooks raises his brows.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i suppose that you mean this excuses concealing the truth. then why ahouls any of us believe you now?}
<A>__{and in the silence...}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{question withdrawn, you may step down.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{you're implying th...}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i said. no further questions.}

<A>__{no response from kabuo. he stands above the larger man. silent, neutral. waiting.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{seven acres. i'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em. just curious, is all.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{what are you sellin' 'em for? why don't we start there.}
<A>__{which makes the big man smile. just a little.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{did i say i was selling? but if i was, i'd have to figure you want 'em real bad. oughta charge a sall fortune, maybe...}
<A>__{a slight shrug. of giant shoulders.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{then again. maybe you'd want your battery back.}
<A>__{kabuo doesn't grin back. his face shows nothing at all.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{the battery's in, that's done with. besides, you'd do the same for m...}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{... might do the same. i have to warn you 'bout that, chief. i'm not screwed together like i used to be.}
<A>__{kabuo's face remains impassive. patient. and the big man squints up into it. holding a handkerchief to his injured hand.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{hell, i'm sorry, okay? about the whole damn mess. if i'd a been around, my mother wouldn't a pulled it off that way.}
<A>__{he is sorry. and with that, kabuo's face eases. becomes like carl's own.}
<C>__{carl }
<D>__{i was out there at sea. fightin' you jap sons a bitches.}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{i'm an american. did i call you a nazi, you big nazi bastard?}
<C>__{carl }
<D>__{not that i recall.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i killed men who looked just like you, pig fed german bastards. and their blood don't wash off so easy.}
<A>__{still no smile. carl staring up.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{so don't talk to me about japs, you big nazi son of a bitch.}
<A>__{carl laughs. and kabuo chuckles, right along with him. having kept his poker face the longer.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i am a bastard. i'm a big hun nazi son of a bitch. and i still got your bamboo fishing rod.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{oh, yeh?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{hid it from my mom. caught a mess a sea runs. damn thing's still in my closet.}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{you can have it. the hell with it.}
<A>__{the look between them now. is very wonderful. in the subtlety of its connection.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{$1200 an acre, that's what i paid ole, won't take a dime less. you got no choice on that.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{didn't say i was buyin' did i? what you want down? just bein' curious, is all.}
<A>__{the handkerchief comes away from carl's palm. and rising, his hand extends toward the smaller man.}

<D>__{a thousand down. we'll sign papers t'morrow.}
<A>__{the hands grip. and they hold. and the length of this clasp, and the straightness of their gaze, and the silence of the moment. wash years away.}

<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{as my wife testified, we were considering it.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{actually, she said you had decided. decided not not come forward.}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{i was thinking about it. every minute.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{except even when sheriff moran arrested you. you said nothing about seeing carl.}
<A>__{turns to the jury. openly bewildered.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{at that point, you were already under suspicion. the battery story explained things. if the story was true...and not simply something you thought up later...}
<A>__{turns back. to the defendant.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{why. didn't you. tell it?}
<A>__{no reaction from the defendant. nothing anyone can see.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{sheriff said right off, i was under suspicion. i didn't have a lawyer...}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{but even after you had an attorney. you still claimed to know nothing . claimed not to have seen carl. am i correct?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{yes. initially.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir. you'd been arrested, you had a lawyer, and you still claimed ignorance!}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i should have told everything right away. i know that now, and i regret it.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{should have told 'everything'. meaning, you should have told the truth .}
<A>__{we can just discern the anger. at the edge of kabuo's steady gaze. silence.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{nothing to say?}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{i didn't know that was a question. it sounded like a speech.}
<A>__{and hooks smiles. loving it. walks toward the witness, stalking him.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{my apologies. do you regret not telling the truth?}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i have told the truth.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{you mean, this morning. the new story, the battery story. that one is the truth? that's a question, sir.}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{yes. and i told it long before this morning.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i see. now what happened the day carl heine was found? before your arrest.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i slept til one thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news. we talked for a few hours. i left at six and went straight to my boat.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{didn't go anywhere else? no errands, no purchases? just straight to the boat. that's the truth.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{hooks leans over the box. ever so slightly invading kabuo's space.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{well, the sheriff found two batteries in your well. if you left one with carl heine, how is that possible?}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i had a spare battery in my shed. i brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.}
<A>__{ah. i see.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{conveniently, in your shed. only you didn't mention that a moment ago. why does this battery story change every time a new question is raised?}
<A>__{kabuo looks at him, evenly.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{you asked if i went straight to the boat. i did. with the battery.}
<A>__{hooks steps back. looks the witness over.}

<C>__{nels }
<D>__{objection!}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{you know better than that, mr. hooks. either ask questions that count for something, or sit down and be done with it.}
<A>__{silence. the judge staring hard. hooks never flinching.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{shame on you.}
<A>__{hooks turns his eyes to kabuo. stares him down, so the jury can watch kabuo's implacable stare in return. and softly...}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i apologize to the court, for letting my feelings get the better of me.}
<A>__{turns away.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{no other questions. we'll go to summation.}
<A>__{as he returns to his table. as kabuo steps down from the box. we pan... ...reporters' row. the boys are writing as fast as their hands can move. only ishmael is not writing at all. he stares at the pad resting on hsi right knee. we close to see... one word circled. the word 'lantern'.}
<L>__{interior courtroom later}
<A>__{alvin hooks stalks the jury box now. prowls before them along the rail. as their eyes follow.}

<D>__{...believing that etta heine's son would never sell him the land. land that in his mind, filtered through ancient rules of behavior handed down from his ancestors' culture, belonged to his family by right...}
<A>__{stops. to make sure they understand.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{his only choice to get the land would be to eliminate carl heine. so that ole jurgensen would need a new buyer.}
<A>__{pacing again, hand trailing along the rail...}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{in his mind. seen through codes of revenge difficult for us to fathom, this was also the only way to avenge what he felt to be the grievous dishonor brought to his father, his family...}
<A>__{raises his finger. this must be heard...}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{...to a thousand years of ancestry, in a foreign land we still find an enigma. despite our recent bitter experience with its ways.}
<A>__{and stops once more. places his hands on the rail.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{thus believing cold blooded murder to be justified ...he trailed carl heine... could hear his engine in the fog...and sounded his own horn, claiming distress.}
<A>__{straightens up. shakes his head, ever so slightly.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{as carl pulled alongside: 'please, carl,' the defendant must have said. 'i am sorry for what has come between us, but adrift here in the fog, i plead for your help!'}
<A>__{imagine. imagine that.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{and so this good man tied his boat fast, while his enemy leaps aboard, striking the treacherous blow he was trained to strike by his father's hand.}
<A>__{counting off the facts. one finger at a time.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{the feud over these seven acres had festered for eight years . he argued with carl about buying the land one week before carl was killed. carl's skull was crushed, and his blood is on a murder weapon with which the defendant is a deadly expert !}
<A>__{spreads his arms. wide.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{and after a series of lies . the defendant at last admits he was there . alone on the boat. in the fog. carl heine's blood on his fishing gaff.}

<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{look clearly at the defendant. see the truth self evident in him. and in the facts of this case.}
<A>__{and turns. so that they will follow his eyes to kabuo's stone hard gaze.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{look into his eyes, ladies and gentlemen, consider his face. and ask yourself what your duty is as citizens of this community.}
<L>__{interior courtroom later}

<D>__{...not a single witness has testified to anything that could suggest pre meditated murder. not in the days before carl heine's death...or at any time...has anyone described a murderous rage toward the deceased.}
<A>__{nels stands very still. hands resting on the rail. as calm and quiet as his adversary had been dramatic.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{etta heine had cheated his family. he had asked his childhood friend carl to sell him the land. and carl was considering it.}
<A>__{leans forward. just a little.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{there is no evidence of anger at carl, much less rage , much less murderous rage. no reason for premeditation and no evidence of it. anywhere.}
<A>__{he picks out a housewife. the youngest. smiles sadly, wisely. as her grandfather might.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{and yet the state is required to prove these things. beyond. a reasonable. doubt.}
<A>__{his eyes widen.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{can you seriously think there is no reasonable doubt? why is kabuo's d 6 battery in carl's well, if carl was helping him ?}
<A>__{why?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{why isn't the blood on the gaff more consistent with carl's hand wound than a skull fracture? given the absence of bone or brain tissue.}
<A>__{and now. he begins to pace, limping slightly, eyes down.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{what mr. hooks asks you to believe is that no proof is needed. against a man who bombed pearl harbor.}
<A>__{slow. eyes on his feet.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{look at his face, the prosecutor said. presuming that you will see an enemy there. treacherous by nature, by a thousand years of something or other.}
<A>__{he stops. looks at them.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{an argument i find as despicable as it is dishonest and twisted and insulting to us all. mr. miyamoto is a much decorated hero of the united states army. for god's sake.}
<A>__{the feeling wells in te old man. it bleeds through the very quietness of his voice.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{if someone said you should convict carl heine. or his lovely widow. of murder. without proof. because their ancestry is the same as hitler's. you would spit in his eye.}
<A>__{yes, you would.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{and every decent american. would applaud you.}
<A>__{he leans his elbows on their rail. as if confiding to them across their backyard fence.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{now kabuo miyamoto did one thing wrong. he was afraid to trust us, at first. afraid that he would be crucified by prejudice. as mr. hooks is urging you to do.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{well, we sent him. and his wife. and thousands of americans to concentration camps. they lost homes, belongings, everything. we did that, folks. can we now be unforgiving about his uncertainty? his mistrust?}
<A>__{looking in their eyes. as if waiting for an answer. they shift their weight, fidget beneath his gaze.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you may think this is a small trial. in a small place. well, it isn't.}
<A>__{he straightens his spine. winces slightly, with the pain of it.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{every once in awhile. somewhere in the world. humanity goes on trial. and integrity. and decency. every once in awhile, common folks get called on to give the report card for the human race.}

<D>__{look, if he gave carl a battery like he said, he'd only a had one left. not two.}
<C>__{alexander van ness}
<D>__{he explained that. he replaced it. harlan mcqueen only he threw that part in when he got cornered. but first time around, he never mentioned it.}
<C>__{roger porter}
<D>__{alex, stop arguin' just to argue. you can see what really happened, same as us. isn't that what we're supposed to do is tell the actual truth? my god, carl died, here.}
<C>__{alexander van ness}
<D>__{so i don't care carl died, unless i'm ready to reach for the hangman's rope? you oughta stop tryin' to bully me into hurrying.}
<A>__{little anger in that. it brings a silence.}
<C>__{burke latham}
<D>__{been six hours. you sayin' there's a way to go slower?}
<L>__{interior nels' kitchen late night}
<A>__{nels in a ratty, frayed old robe, pouring hot water from a kettle into mismatched cups. his hair is wispy and wild, his eyes puffy. he coughs horrible. clears his throat...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{well. it's imaginative...}
<A>__{and drops tea bags into the cups with a splash.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{...i will give you that.}
<A>__{lisps over to the cluttered table. where his guest is waiting.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{it's the way it happened, i know it is.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{no, you don't.}
<A>__{nels sits. slowly. ishmael removes his bag. sips his tea.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{that report. about the freighter? you didn't find that tonight, did you?}
<A>__{no answer. ishmael keeps sipping. holding eye contact.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you went right to the cell. then to the boat. then here. how long did you know about the freighter?}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{one day.}
<A>__{nels' turn. to sip his tea.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{this tastes horrible, hmmn?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{you're wondering why i held it.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{i'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones. in the middle of the night.}
<A>__{and he smiles. a wonderful smile.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{your daddy. was quite a feller.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{yes, he was.}
<A>__{another sip.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{he's looking down. and he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday. he's proud of the man you are tonight. that's what counts.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{to my father. everything counts.}
<A>__{nels watches the pain in that.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{what if i told you he once said to me...don't matter the road we take. just so we get there.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{then you'd be lying.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{doesn't make me wrong.}
<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{the jury once more in the jury box. pan their faces. the faces we saw last night.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{all right, let's say that twine had been there to lash a lantern. that it had come from the shuttle of twine found in the deceased's pocket.}
<A>__{edith twardzik. burke latham. alexander van ness.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{now to re open a trial that had gone to jury...new evidence should be pretty important.}
<A>__{see ishmael. quiet, intense. on the witness stand.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{tell us why that lantern would be so significant.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{well. it shows the prosecutor was wrong. it was carl's boat that was dead in the water. or he'd never have put up the lantern.}
<A>__{nels thinks about that. so the jury will, too.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{now you believe there were two lanterns when defendant arrived. one in carl's hand. the second lashed to the mast.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{that's what mr. miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. he couldn't know that it would help his case.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{well, why does it?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{because the second lantern, the one on the mast. was never found. so we have to ask...}
<A>__{a slight shurg. stating the obvious.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{...where did it go?}
<A>__{and then...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{maybe it went. where carl went. over the side.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{objection! speculation.}
<A>__{nels smiles his grandfather smile.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{your honor, all of this is speculation. including mr. hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{tht was summation, your h...}
<C>__{judge }
<D>__{overruled, alvin. let's hear this, hmmn?}
<A>__{nels gudmundsson nods to himself. takes a stroll over to the jury box. no limp today. something has put some spring in his step.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{so how does this fit with what you told us at the start? the freighter that plowed through ship channel bank...}
<A>__{and turns. leaning his scrawny butt against the jury's rail. he'll watch this with them now.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{that's when he fell.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{fell.}
<A>__{ishmael settles in. here we go.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{miyamoto gave him the battery, and left. carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing. but at some point, he thinks of the lantern...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{still lashed to the mast.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there. so he climbs up. to cut it down.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{just as the freighter comes through? isn't that quite a coincidence?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{coincidences happen. you run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere. split second tragedy happens every day. or maybe...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{maybe...?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{maybe carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working. same report milholland heard. and that makes him get the lantern fast. before the freighter's wake can bang it around.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{but you could be wrong. he could have climbed up earlier.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{then where's the lantern? and where's the knife?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{the knife. what knife?}
<A>__{as if he really has forgotten. as if he wants to know.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{coroner found an empty knife sheath on carl's belt. but they never found the knife.}
<A>__{he's nodding. yes, that's right.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{he climbs up. his hand wound still bleeding. that's the blood i found on the mast. and the twine.}
<A>__{nels' eyes are rapt. his mouth is shut. no way he interrupts this roll.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{he cuts the lantern free, the freighter's wake hits , the boat rolls hard , his bloody hand slips . tracing blood along the mast...}
<A>__{a hush.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{he falls. the lantern, the knife, go into the water. same as carl.}
<A>__{the words hang there.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{and inside the cabin, a coffee cup falls off the counter.}
<A>__{shakes his head.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{but there's no one around. to pick it up.}
<A>__{nels ponders. puts his hand to his chin.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{still a coincidence. timing and all.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{the freighter started through at 1:42. the sea water seeped into carl's watch and stopped it. at 1:47.}
<T>__{cut :}
<A>__{to the defendant. ramrod straight, nothing revealed in his face. and to his wife. elegant, erect. her eyes flooded with tears.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{still and all. carl was a strong swimmer, he m...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{he hit his head. on the way in.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you think so?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{the sheriff and the deputy and i inspected the deck closely. we found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel. just below the mast.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{well, anything coulda caused that.}
<A>__{ishmael nods. no smile at all.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{anything. that had a blond hair.}
<A>__{and nels is walking now. toward the prosecutor's table. pulling a small cellophane bag from hisinside pocket.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{request introduction of exhibit 18. one single blond hair. which sheriff moran dug out of that fracture. below the mast. of carl heine's boat.}
<A>__{lays the bag on the table. just in front of hooks. turns to the judge.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{we will call sheriff moran, who will confirm this. and coroner whaley to testify that the damage to the gunnel is of a size and nature not inconsistent with the deceased's skull fracture...}
<A>__{turns to the prosecutor...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{but for now. your witness...}
<A>__{and just strolls on over to his seat. looks in his client's eyes. how 'bout them apples? kabuo loves this old guy. and right here, he lets a little of that show. across the way, the prosector is rising. he smiles. friendly, almost amused.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i have to start reading your paper more closely. you're quite a storyteller.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{thank you. coming from the man who wrote, 'but here, adrift in the fog, i plead for your help'...that's quite a compliment.}
<A>__{there is a ripple of laughter. but no smile on ishmael's features. his game face is on. come and get me, sucker. and hooks does come, one step at a time. straight to the box.}
<D>__{hooks everything had to happen just right. for your little story to fly. i mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a lot of reasons.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i'm sorry, was there a question in there?}
<A>__{no love lost. and no pretense about it. hatsue miyamoto sits with her hand in her mother's. watching these men battle for her husband's life.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{well, the freighter. the twine. the blood. the knife. the cup. the watch. the second battery. the phantom lantern. the fishing gaff. the cracked gunnel. the skull wound. the blond hair. that's eleven things...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{twelve.}
<A>__{hooks smiles.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i stand corrected, sir. and you have a neat explanation for every one of them.}
<A>__{hooks nods. yes, you do.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{and since you confess this is all pure guesswork. what is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{my expertise. is that i'm a journalist.}
<A>__{right at his eyes.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{and journalism. is balance. finding the facts folks need to know.}
<A>__{the words ring with quiet, heartfelt conviction, that others cannot fully appreciate.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{then putting them together. so truth is revealed.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{but isn't the truth that there are several other ways to explain each of these twelve pieces.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{oh, yes.}
<A>__{and the prosecutor stops. confused for an instant by this confession. until...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{but no other way. to explain them all.}
<A>__{a heart stopping hush. as everyone, as hooks himself, sees the cehckmate.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{and since they all happened. this is the only explanation that's the truth.}
<A>__{the prosecutor looks like he's been slapped. like every act of will is necessary to maintain composure. to find the easy, untroubled smile.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{your line of work. you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{like you couldn't believe.}
<A>__{service returned. hooks leans in.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{well, the defendant is a liar. he's confessed that much. and his explanation is...he was afraid.}
<A>__{and leans in some more.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{afraid that the good folks of this jury. would be too stupid to understand. too prejudiced to be fair.}
<A>__{shakes his head.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{you buy that?}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i think he was greedy.}
<A>__{and once more. the prosecutor can only blink. can only move toward the trap.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{greedy.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{he didn't want to lose any more.}
<A>__{no smile. no smile as the trap springs shut.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{he'd lost a lot in the war, you see. i had sent him away. to a concentration camp. but a nice one. far less brutal than the nazis. because i'm a civilized person.}
<A>__{he stops. lets hooks clear his throat.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{that's how journalists. answer questions.}
<A>__{turns to judge fielding. with all respect...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{may i answer the question, your honor? anout the defendant's motivation to lie?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i wouldn't miss it for the world, son. now, you say you sent the defendant to manzanar?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i didn't say. i did it alone.}
<A>__{and things get real quiet.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{so there he was. his father lost his health there, finally died. they lost more than etta heine's seven acres. they lost their liberty, their dignity. their ideals about this country.}
<A>__{so much feeling in this. he has to stop. swallow hard.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{they lost their trust in us. we had treated them worse than animals. how would we now see tham. as human beings?}
<A>__{tells the jury. straight to their faces.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{this man lost a lot in the war. he didn't want now to lose his babies. or the woman who loves him.}
<A>__{another level of quiet. he turns to the prosecutor...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{and my expertise in this, sir. is that i lost a lot in the war myself.}
<A>__{words coming from someplace very deep.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{and the fact that i am the only witness. who placed his right hand upon the holy bible. is the least of it, sir. i assure you of that.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{well, sir. i hate to spoil the soliloquy, i truly do. but the fact is...you are not on trial here. nor is judge fielding, or myself. nor the good people of this jury. for events that took place twelve years ago.}
<A>__{no sir.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{and i wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent ful. at a tactic that insults their intelligence.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{that's curious. i was appealing to their intelligence.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{were you, sir? can you prove one word of all your fancy story?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{no, sir, i can't. not beyond a reasonable doubt.}
<A>__{and he smiles. first time.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{it's fortunate that the man who needs to prove his fancy story. beyond a reasonable doubt. is someone else.}
<A>__{there is laughter in the room, so welcome is any chance to relieve the tension. the gavel bangs.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. hooks. i apologize for my tone. this is not a contest. between you and me.}
<A>__{shakes his head. no, it isn't.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{for it is not. as mr. gudmundsson so wisely put it. a small trial. in a small place.}
<A>__{his eyes are damp now. strangely enough, after all this. he is at last on the brink of losing control. because...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i lost more in that war than anyone will ever know. so did a lot of folks. and what we got back in return...}
<A>__{his voice breaks slightly. but it rings with dignity on...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{...was a country. where a man was innocent. until we proved him guilty.}
<A>__{and the voice drops. to just above a whisper...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{whether we all got cheated. we're about to find out.}
<L>__{interior courthouse corridor day}
<A>__{close on hatsue miyamoto, speaking earnestly, her eyes down, her purse in her lap, her slender hands expressing the intensity of her feelings as she makes her point, and we... pull back to reveal that she is on a corridor bench, surrounded by a half dozen reporters, who are crouching, standing, scribbling away. two photographers pop flashes that she does not seem to notice, as she continues with refined determination, and we... pull back, down the hallway to the pov of a man who sits alone, unnoticed. there is an unopened pack of cigarettes in his only hand, turning absently in long, strong fingers that crinkle the pristine cellophane. his eyes are fixed to hatsue, holding court at a distance. fixed, as if no other sight could ever command this level of attention.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{all things considered...}
<A>__{hearing the voice, ishmael looks down. uneasy to have been caught staring so intently.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{...you were adequate.}
<A>__{no smile accompanies the irony. for that would be condescending.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{i could make a few quibbles, but i am loathe to hurt your feelings.}
<A>__{the old man sits. very slowly.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{cigarette?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{i will take two. one for later.}

<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i've always thought so.}

<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{you ever been strangled by a single hand?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{naw, i've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.}
<A>__{comfortable together. in this hour of discomfort. ishmael brings the corner of the pack to his teeth, and tears the cellophane away.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{better take three...}
<A>__{fingers nimbly shred the seal, open the pack.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{maybe they'll keep us waiting.}
<A>__{shake the tips free. holds the pack forward.}

<D>__{maybe they won't.}

<C>__{nels}
<D>__{prejudice is like any obsession.}

<D>__{oh, sure. these are our neighbors, you know. they've got good hearts. we could see they were following the evidence real close...}
<A>__{at his side, hatsue seems to be scanning the jumble of faces...}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{we're just grateful to every one of them.}
<A>__{...looking for something she doesn't find.}
<D>__{reporter #2 and you ma'am? you felt the same as your husband, i expect?}
<A>__{her eyes move to the eager young man. she reflects for a beat.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{honestly, no.}
<A>__{which catches everyone. a little short.}
<C>__{hatsue }
<D>__{i felt my husband would be found guilty. unless proven innocent.}
<A>__{no apologies for the truth. that's not her way.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{and mr. chambers did that.}
<L>__{interior courthouse basement}
<A>__{a vending machine stands in silence. the eerie strobing glow of defective neon. pull back as... ishmael thinks it over. drops in his dime. pulls the plunger, to watch a snickers fall. scoops the candy from the tray, pins it between his body and the machine. ...tears the wrapper.}
<L>__{interior courthouse corridor}
<A>__{back to the reporters. the crowd of onlookers has grown.}
<D>__{reporter #3 ...can we get some background on your handsome family? i understand you two were childhood sweethearts...}
<A>__{and brings his parker pen to his notepad. his subject smiles easily...}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{well, no sir, not exactly. we met in the manzanar camp, you see, so i guess that was the most beautiful place i've ever been.}
<A>__{there is gentle laughter. and as kabuo looks up, he sees something in the rear of the crowd. something we do not. and softly...}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{no, her first love was another fella...}
<A>__{which brings hatsue's eyes up, following his gaze. and there, in the back. a man watches. eating a candy bar.}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{i was the lucky one.}
<A>__{no one sees their eyes lock. it is only an instant. it is enough.}
<D>__{reporter #4 it all sounds very romantic, ma'am. falling in love under those circumstances...}
<A>__{and as she looks to the reporter, ishmael begins to walk away...}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{he went off to the army, right from manzanar. and that last night, we danced alone in the desert...}
<A>__{and somehow, ishmael catches the eye of hatsue's 4 year old daughter. so he pulls a coin from his pocket...}
<C>__{hatsue }
<D>__{i told him. if you don't come back alive, i will kill you.}
<A>__{...ishmael rolls the coin across his knuckles. and the child responds... with her mother's smile.}
<L>__{exterior courthouse steps dusk}
<A>__{alone on the steps where the strawberry princess once winked at him. snow has begun to fall, soft and altogether beautiful. he squints up...}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{god's kindness, my father said. despite the hardship...it reminds us. of our place in things.}
<A>__{our place in things. he slides a black cigar between his teeth...}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{what the hell. did he mean by that?}
<A>__{he has the match box. manipulating it with the dexterity we've come to know.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{things fall on us, i suppose. from the sky.}
<A>__{strikes the match on his belt buckle...}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{wars. freighters plowing through...}
<A>__{cupping it expertly in a single motion, he brings the flame to the cigar. a single puff.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{and we seem...helpless. until we understand.}
<A>__{one more. savors it. the sky. the thought.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{accident rules every corner of the universe...}
<A>__{down the steps. snow swirling between us. gone.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{except the chambers. of the human heart.}
<T>__{fade slowly to black:}
<B>__{. roll end credits.}
