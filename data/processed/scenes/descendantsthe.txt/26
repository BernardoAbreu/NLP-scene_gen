<L>__{interior law office conference room day}
<A>__{matt enters the room to find seven cousins waiting to greet him. from their casual clothing and shaggy hair, an observer might hardly suspect their status.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{not only am i the sole but i'm a commercial real estate and transactional attorney, so the most involved of my cousins have been meeting with me regularly to analyze the bids cousin dave, cousin hal, cousin six, cousin wink, cousin lisa, cousin connie and cousin stan, both of whom oppose the sale entirely. don't be fooled by appearances. in hawai'i some of the most powerful people look like bums and stuntmen.}
<A>__{later matt and his cousins stand above the conference table, looking at blueprints and architectural drawings.}
<D>__{matt (v.o.) (cont'd) the proposals are virtually the same hotels, shopping centers, condos and golf courses. 3000 new jobs in the first five years. support letters from the construction industry and unions. matt (v.o.) (cont'd) a chicago group is offering half a billion dollars, but we're leaning toward a lower bid from a guy named don holitzer. he's actually from kaua'i and made a fortune in silicon valley. cousin hugh is pushing us in that direction, and i say why not?}
<A>__{close on matt, nodding along but highly distracted, the sound of liz's ventilator growing louder in his brain. we cut to artist: 's renderings of comatose elizabeth wide, closer, closer still, closer.}
