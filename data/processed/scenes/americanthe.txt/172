<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{larry is waiting on the corner of the town square. he is dialling and re dialling a number in his mobile phone, scanning the crowds around him. in the two seconds it takes the taxi to pass by, jack steps free of a row cars on the other side of the street. as larry comes into view again, jack sees the sterling submachine gun in his hands. and larry sees jack. larry's finger tightens on the trigger. l'americano throws himself to one side. there is a quick burst of popping explosions: ripping along the line of parked cars. panic erupts. jack is about to fire back at larry but larry takes cover behind a tourist and fires back another brief burst. jack is hit in the shoulder. he drops his gun... ...and retrieves it just as larry fires again. screams spread through the holiday crowd like a wave of fire moving down the street and spilling into the town square.}
