<P>__{(grabs his collar)}
<D>__{and don't let him see you.}
<A>__{frank gets up, moves down the aisle slowly, eyes on ned. he can't squeeze past the old woman, who is still struggling to pull her huge trunk down aisle. so... he climbs right over the top of it... oblivious to her. frank stares at ned warily as he gets closer. suddenly, jeff squirts a stream of water in ned's eyes. frank sees his chance, rushing past ned toward the vestibule.}
