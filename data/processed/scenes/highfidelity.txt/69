<L>__{interior marie's apartment night}
<A>__{rob and marie are kissing standing up.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{yes. you?}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{for now. but i wouldn't be if i thought this was the end of the evening.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i'm sure it isn't.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{good. in that case, i will fix us something else to drink. you sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{whiskey.}
<A>__{marie goes into the kitchen, and they keep talking around the corner.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees rob, standing and holding his jacket.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i'd better go. i gotta get up early. go over to my parents'.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{when i said before that i hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, i was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.}
<A>__{she plants the whiskeys firmly on the coffee table.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{i'd like it if you could stay the night.}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(as if it is dawning on him)}
<D>__{oh, right. alright.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{jesus, so much for delicacy. i pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i use it but i don't understand it when other people use it.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{so you'll stay?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{marie picks up the drinks again and exits to the bedroom. rob just stands there... and the lighting changes.}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(to camera)}
<D>__{over nine million men in this country have slept with ten or more women. and do they all look like richard gere? are they all as rich as bill gates? charming as oscar wilde? hell no. nothing to do with any of that. maybe fifty or so have one or more of these attributes, but that still leaves... well, about nine million, give or take fifty. and they're just men. regular guys. we're just guys, because i, even i, am a member of this exclusive, nine million member club. in fact, marie is my seventeenth lover. "how does he do it?" you ask. "he wears bad sweaters, he's grumpy, he's broke, he hangs out with the musical moron twins, and he gets to go to bed with a recording artist who looks like susan dey slash meg ryan. what's going on? listen up, because i think i can explain, with all modesty aside: i ask questions. that's it. that's my secret. it works precisely because that isn't how you're supposed to do it, if you listen to the collective male wisdom. there are still enough old style, big mouthed, egomaniacs running around to make someone like me appear to be refreshingly different. if you can't hack this simple strategy, there are some women out there, of course, who want to get pushed around, ignored and mowed over, but do you really want to be with them anyway?}
<A>__{...he goes through a door into the bedroom. marie is taking off her earrings.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{would you like me to turn the lights out? or would you like them on?}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{god, you ask a lot of questions.}
