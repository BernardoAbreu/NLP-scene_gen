<C>__{mika}
<D>__{how long have you been here? and you can't say "zwei cola bitte"?}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{course i can, but you tend to hear more interesting things if people don't know you can understand what they're saying.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{do you ever stop being a cop?}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{not the way i was raised. my dad always said, being a cop has nothing to do with a clock. it's a consequence of consciousness often interpreted as desire.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{desire?}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{for justice. and doughnuts.}
<A>__{he smiles as they move to one of the circular tables.}
<C>__{maslow }
<D>__{so you got something else?}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{i think so. same template as before. the transfer was made the day before a multiple homicide in osaka. the police and newspapers are calling it a gangland slaying.}

<D>__{good.}

<C>__{mika}
<D>__{but you said you found something.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{a report. a friend of mine in moscow, tipped me to it.}
<A>__{he slips an envelope from his briefcase and gives it to her.}
<C>__{maslow }
<D>__{it was written during the height of the cold war by a high ranking kgb agent named aleksei sabatin. in it, he raises the possibility that several political assassinations were conducted by an ancient but very sophisticated network he calls the nine clans.}
<C>__{maslow }
<D>__{mind you, he doesn't call them ninjas.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{what happened to him?}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{same thing that's going to happen to me, if i keep hanging around with you booted out of the service for mental instability.}

<D>__{ninjas? are you kidding?}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{then why are you doing this?}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{no idea }
<A>__{he finishes his soda and takes his garbage to the can.}
<C>__{maslow }
<D>__{but i can guarantee you that it has nothing to do with the fact that you're the most attractive researcher that i've ever worked with.}
<A>__{he smiles and turns before she flushes a bright shade of red.}
