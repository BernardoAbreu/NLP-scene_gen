<D>__{they were real nice to me there. they treated me, y'know... nice. thanks, barney.}
<A>__{mr. thomas tries not to wince at the familiarity.}
<C>__{mr. thomas}
<D>__{you're very welcome, miss vivian.}
<A>__{she smiles at him. he watches as vivian turns and walks toward the elevator. the provocative way her hips move just naturally attracts the attention of a male passerby. and the white gloved elevator man literally leaps to press the elevator button for vivian who rewards him with a happy smile. mr. thomas sighs.}
