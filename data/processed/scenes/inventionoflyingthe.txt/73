<L>__{exterior mark's apartment building night}
<A>__{ots of newscaster cameraman. the newscaster is interviewing a young man, with mark's apartment building in the background.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{i heard that he said we all get mansions, and that there's even ponies.}
<C>__{newscaster}
<P>__{(to cameraman)}
<D>__{ponies. mansions. ice cream. these are the things we can all expect when we die. what else can we expect? we won't know until mark bellison steps out of that...}
<C>__{young man}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{there he is!}
<A>__{mark cracks open the front door and steps out onto his front steps, with jennifer right behind him. the newscaster and cameraman run to get into position. mark looks out at the sea of people staring silently at him, waiting for answers.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{a man runs up and hands mark a microphone.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{oh, thanks.}
<A>__{his voice echoes through the neighborhood.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{you could hear a pin drop. no one is even breathing.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{so. i guess you've all heard the things i told my grandmother last night and... i understand why you're here.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i know... some things. some very important things. and i'm going to share these things with you now.}
<A>__{intercut throughout: different video feeds, people listening to radios, standing in the cold watching tv's through store windows all around the world. mark takes a deep breath and holds up his "pizza box commandments".}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{everything you want to know is written here. on this old pizza box.}
<A>__{mark looks out at the crowd, all of them so hopeful, so needy. mark looks back at jennifer and greg who give him a proud nod.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{number one: there is a man who lives in the sky who controls everything. number two... man #1}
<P>__{(interrupting; shouting)}
<D>__{whoa, whoa whoa. what does he look like?}
<A>__{mark wasn't prepared for questions.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(struggling)}
<D>__{tall. big hands. a good head of hair. woman #1 what ethnicity is he?}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(making it up as he goes)}
<D>__{he's a new ethnicity. it's like a mix of all of our ethnicities. man #2 does he live on a cloud? man #3 can we see him?}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(becoming confident)}
<D>__{no. he lives much higher than the clouds, too high to see. woman #2 so he lives in space?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no, not that high. man #3 so you mean the thermosphere?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{look, people i got a lot to get through here. i'm just telling you what i know: man. lives in the sky. you can't see him. controls everything. cool?}
<A>__{everyone nods.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{number two: when you die you don't disappear into an eternity of nothingness. instead, you go to a really great place.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{number three: in that place every person will get a mansion. man #4 what kind of mansion?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't know. whatever kind of mansion you're thinking of right now. woman #3 oh no! i wasn't thinking of a mansion!}
<A>__{a lot of people echo this sentiment.}
<D>__{man #5 shit! i was thinking of a horrible mansion!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{look, it's the best mansion you can think of, not just now, but ever. whatever the best mansion for you can possibly be, that's the one you'll get.}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{number four: when you die, all the people you love will be there too. man #6 will they have their own mansions?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes, of course. everyone gets a mansion. man #6 what if i want them to live in my mansion?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{if they want to live with you, they can leave their mansion and live in yours. man #6 what happens to their mansion?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't know, it goes back on the market. woman #4 what about the people i hate? will they be there too?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no. woman #4 where are they?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{okay, they're probably there, but you'll never see them. they're far off, too far for you to get there. woman #4 but what if they try to find me?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{they won't. they hate you too. woman #4 but what if they don't? what if they love me but i hate them?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well then you're just... you'll both be fine with it. there's only love there, okay?}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{number five: when you die there will be free ice cream. all day. all night. whatever flavor you can think of. woman #5 what, even bad flavors?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{but why would you eat bad flavors? woman #5 well, you just said every flavor i can think of. man #8 oh no, i just thought about vanilla and skunks!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well don't eat it then! woman #6 i've just thought the chocolate sauce is diarrhea!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well don't put it on then! what's wrong with you people? i mean...}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{number six: if you do bad things you won't get to go to this great place when you die. man #9 where will you go?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{a terrible place. the worst place imaginable.}
<A>__{a rumble of terror moves through the crowd.}
<D>__{woman #7 what constitutes a bad thing?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{murder. crime. rape. things like that. woman #7 you have to tell us all the things or else we might do them and it wouldn't be our fault!}
<A>__{the whole crowd echoes this sentiment.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{fine. man #9 is punching someone bad?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes. man #9 what if they're trying to hurt you?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{then it's fine. woman #7 is cursing bad?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no. woman #1 what about being late for work?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that's fine too. i mean, you might lose your job if your boss doesn't like it, but it won't effect what happens after you die. woman #2 what about if you forget to feed your dog?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that also is fine. unless the dog dies. then it's bad. man #1 if you do just one bad thing do you go to the bad place?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no. you get...}
<P>__{(thinking about it)}
<D>__{... three chances. if you do three bad things you're out. man #1 like baseball!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{kind of, yes.}
<A>__{there's a hubbub throughout the crowd: "it's like baseball", "i love baseball" "i'm scared of the bad place".}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{any more?}
<A>__{about fifty people stand up and ask their questions at the same time.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{look, can we just move on? man #2 no! we have to know everything that's bad!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{fine. let's start with you...}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{man #3 is it bad to wear pants?}
<A>__{mark sighs.}
