<A>__{dark night. most street lights shot out. just one or two of the eerie vapor lights left on the block. a middle aged african american man carries his single bag of groceries. the man listens and watches carefully, as he negotiates the darkness between the few pools of light on the street. we won't see his face until he reaches the next pool of light, but he walks with shoulders hunched in fear. moving down the block, all shops abandoned. broken windows. rats. the man almost trips over a vague shadow passed out and crumpled in an abandoned doorway. it's the crackhead we saw mumbling himself into the nod off zone. he's still faintly singing a part of the bones song as the man passes. he stops in the light. and we see it's shotgun: 20 years of fear and loathing etched on his face. he freezes, listening for a second to the crackheads wheezing mumbles no it's something else he's listening for and hearing. from behind him a low wheezy sound, like some huge panting dog. he stops. and it stops. he walks on and it follows: as he hurries to the next pool of light and safety, his ears strain for the nearly silent padding and wheezing steadily following. suddenly, he hears that panting closer and closer until it's nearly right behind him. he starts running, though he hasn't yet seen anything. only heard the mongrel hot on his heels.}
<B>__{follow with shotgun}
<A>__{as he stumbles, careens, and wheezes through the streets and alleys, terrified. winded, he eventually stops, his hand trembling into his shopping bag, seeking a weapon. and we see the building he's paused beside: bones' place. pockmarked by age. like the face of some furious old man. now he can almost feel the dog's breath on the back of his neck...shotgun spins, whipping a bottle of milk out of the bag and hurling it into the darkness behind him. the bottle smashes against the wall of bones' building. for a second, silhouetted against the now whited wall, the tall, too tall, shape of the skinny black dog. without waiting to see what he hit, shotgun takes off running to reach his building across the street. the sound of the dog's nails skittering across the street right behind him and he just makes it }

<D>__{gimme some light.}
<A>__{behind jason we see a shape, a shadow, a tall silhouette, a man shaped deeper darkness forming within the darkness. jason lights his lighter. and in the flickering we see behind him that this room now contains a portion of hell: it's not just the chipped paint and peeled rotted wall paper, or the cracks and gaps in the broken old ceiling mirror. all surfaces seem to be a swirling, shifting pattern in which we can dimly and subliminally make out faces as if people were trapped on the surface of things. exactly like the glimpse we had beneath the world when jimmy died... the floor, the walls, the furniture, everything in it made out of the wracked and twisted devouring and devoured forms of dead souls. their faces, hollow pleading eyes and howling mouths visible like flowing grain in wood. and in the center of it all stands the dark silhouette of bones, impossibly tall and thin, stretching malevolently out across the room like a living shadow. but the boys don't see this as they're finding the door. we see bones shadow arching towards them while they fumble. palmer finally opens the door to the sound of a deep rumbling growl from the darkness on the other side. and in the open door stands the black dog. they boys jump back. but breathes easy.}
<C>__{palmer }
<D>__{just a dog...}
<A>__{and the black dog leaps up at them teeth flying right for the boys' throats. and in the flickering ghastly light we see its demon face breaking through. the dog sinks his long teeth into jason's arm. he flails and drops his lighter, still lit, on the floor. as soon as he does, the dog releases jason, and disappears as fast as it appeared, back into the darkness. the two kids panic, jason shaking and bleeding, looking around, waiting for the dog or something else to attack, seeing back through the doorway into the room from hell. behind them we see that tall man shaped shadow. the bones shadow is oblivious to the two frantic boys, intent only on the small flickering flame of the lighter still burning where it fell against the lower wood paneling of the wall. a thin trail of black smoke as the flame barely begins to catch on the chipped lead filled flammable painterior}
<B>__{the boys run}
<A>__{and stumble down the hall away from the horror, while back in the room the bones shadow watches as the lighter flickers and dies out. other than a slightly blackened spot, the wall is unburned. the black shadow shudders in rage, arches back and hooooowls in frustration, its mouth abnormally large. the shadowy head snaps in the direction of the boys ready to vent it's wrath, and for a subliminal second we see in the head, the hellish face of jimmy bones. the boys round the second floor landing and fly down the last flight of stairs. jason's foot breaks through a rotted floorboard and for a second, it appears as though rotten hands are just below the stairs, grabbing at his foot and leg. he yelps in terror, pulling his foot back as they continue towards the front door, the bones thing's woofer busting howl roaring down from the third floor.}
<B>__{the sheer infinite adrenaline rush}
<A>__{of pure horror and the desperation to survive drags the boys off the stairs as they tear across the floor and hurl themselves out the front door into the night air... jason falling and lying on the stoop.}
<L>__{exterior bones' building continuous}
<A>__{across the street, shotgun sees the boys in the doorway. then, as a nearly dead vapor light suddenly flickers and comes to life, the shadows created on bones' building make it look almost like a demonic face. gulping for air, laughing hysterically at their survival, the frat boys pause. jason sits back on his butt, checking his wound. the doorway behind them just a black hole in space.}

<B>__{with shotgun}
<A>__{when he hears the boys pitiful screams and whimpers from across the street, he leaps to his feet and tries to see into the dark of the doorway across the street. but he can only hear what is happening to the unlucky frat fellas: moans and the sound of flesh torn, and swallowed, and their last dying screams.}

<D>__{tia? patrick? that you?}
<A>__{the sounds return, fainter, and form above. bill looks up, and for a fraction of a second in the mirror, bill sees the crowded eerie hell of the other version of the room. bill jolts out of bed and to the door, whips it open, and someone dark looms right there. but it's just patrick.}

<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{must be something seeping through. from the floor.}
<A>__{they roll the carpet back, thinking there must be something on the floor. the floor beneath the carpet is wet too, but can't tell if it's from the rug or vice versa. he puts his hand down on the wood. a low rhythmic rumbling.}

<D>__{check it out. the same shit that was in the carpet. told you it was from the plumbing.}
<A>__{he lifts the wrench to tighten the seal. the metal groans. then snaps. sending a thick spray of foul smelling red sludge shooting out of the seam, right into patrick's face.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{damn, i knew these pipes were wacked.}
<A>__{he turns the wrench the other way, re tightening. the sound seems to move now through the piping. then the red sludge sprays out of the next three joints, smearing the others. the pounding, throbbing sounds begin to bounce around the room, as if something were actually moving through the pipes until it returns to the central large pipe and moves down, disappearing beneath their feet. then a rasping bark calls their attention. bones the dog sits by the padlocked door, panting. grinning. patrick smashes the old lock with the large wrench and opens the door to reveal another set of stairs leading down into a deeper storm cellar where the sound disappeared.}

<L>__{interior bones' room continuous}
<A>__{cinnabar gets into bed and turns off the light. pitch dark in there, can't see a thing. as she's drifting off to dreamland, she hears what sounds like the door quietly opening and someone slipping into the darkness of the room, we just stay on her face. it's cold in the place. and spooky. so she doesn't mind when she feels what she assumes is patrick slip in bed beside her. though we see only a shape sliding under the covers.}

<A>__{maurice puts a finger to his lips and beckons them to follow. the boys want it to be maurice. but cinnabar knows better.}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{that's not maurice }
<A>__{but with the beam of the flickering flashlight, they follow the shadowy figure up the steps. then maurice gets a bit to far ahead, and they can't see him for a beat.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{maurice. hold up, man.}
<A>__{then after a silent beat, just maurice's hand appears back out of the darkness, beckoning them onward. then the flashlight cuts out again. they're back in the darkness.}
<C>__{patrick }
<P>__{(as he shakes the flashlight)}
<D>__{okay, we're on the second floor. i feel it. no more steps.}
<A>__{the sound of patrick cursing and shaking the batteries around in the torch. eventually it comes on again. up ahead, they still barely see maurice, his back to them, face in one quarter profile, leading them towards the next flight of stairs at the end of the hall. they follow. closer and closer to the stairs, maurice going eerily in and out of their vision. the flashlight dies again. darkness. patrick shakes it and it comes back quickly. then just as quickly dies again! a shake and it's lit again just as bill is stepping into the corner where maurice disappeared.}
<B>__{flickering horror}
<A>__{as the dog leaps at them from the corner, all teeth and slavering jaws! everyone scrambles for their lives, and the flashlight falls to the floor. low angle from the floor just behind the flashlight we see the skewed horror: as the dog tears at bill, as his gun skitters across the floor; as patrick grabs the gun and fires, and we get a bit more illumination from the exploding gunpowder. but it does no good. bill screams in terror as he's torn to pieces, and then the flashlight goes out and again, we're in stygian darkness. the sound of bill dying and a long silence.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{bill?! cinnabar? cinnabar?!}
<A>__{no answer. at first. finally in husky voice:}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{i'm here.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{bill! bill?!}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{patrick, he's...}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{okay, okay. listen:}
<A>__{from somewhere comes the sound of the music from bones' crib.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{here, find my hand. the stairs are right near here. i saw them. let's just walk up there.}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{i can't find you.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{here!}
<A>__{silence. as we expect the worse, expect something else to take her hand. but then:}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{is that you?}
<A>__{pause the music from bones' crib still beckons to them.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{yeah. come on. don't let go.}
<A>__{we're in near total darkness as they climb the stairs, maybe a bit of moonlight now coming in from the roofless third floor they're approaching. all we can hear is their footsteps and their breathing as they walk the rest of the way up the stairs and emerge into: bones' crib their pov both amazed to see pearl as young and beautiful as cinnabar is, clinging to the dashing jimmy dancing to the spectral sounds of some soul classic from back in the day. cinnabar entranced by the vision.}
<B>__{angle as}
<A>__{pearl opens her dreaming eyes and sees them, smiling and beckoning cinnabar to come join her. cinnabar begins to. patrick watches her until he hears something o.s. calling to him. it sounds a million miles away and yet right in his ear. and it sounds like jeremiah.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{paaatrick...}
<A>__{patrick's pov he turns and looks at the wall subtly surging from beneath the surface of the wall he sees flashes of faces and hands, mouths twisted in torment. he moves to the wall, drawn by the strange sight and the recurring sound...}
<C>__{jeremiah }
<P>__{(as if a million miles away)}
<D>__{patrick. help me.}
<A>__{it's coming from within the wall.}
<L>__{intercutting}
<A>__{now, while cinnabar is advancing towards her mother and father across the room patrick, at the wall, tries to place his ear near it in order to hear where the voice is coming from. while cinnabar is now within bones' reach. pearl steps back to allow jimmy to embrace cinnabar. they're reunited.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{welcome home, baby girl.}
<A>__{pearl watches as bones caresses his daughter's cheek. patrick now close to the wall trying to hear the faint voice calling to him.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{please...help me...}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{suddenly something enormous presses out from the wall. patrick stumbles back as his father's head and torso press out from the wall, stretched in straining effort.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{help me. i'm so sorry. but please, help me...}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{daddy?}
<A>__{jeremiah, or what he's become embedded into the wall, his face stretched, mouth huge and hollow eyes dripping bloody tears.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{please. help me. i'm scared.}
<A>__{patrick in anguish.}
<C>__{jeremiah }
<D>__{it hurts. i don't want to spend forever like this.}
<A>__{jeremiah's arm reaches out from the wall, grasping towards patrick, who reaches out to his father when suddenly with frightening speed jeremiah grabs it, and wrenches patrick to him, pulling patrick flush up against the wall, even starting to suck him in to the wall.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{no!!!}
<A>__{as patrick struggles and writhes and twists to get free from his father's grasp, he can see back across the room to the others. he sees the room as it really is he can see what's really happening. pearl, not in a new dress, but in a horrible tattered, blood encrusted old dress, standing next to a rotting cadaver that's stroking cinnabar's cheek and holding her close... jeremiah pulling patrick into the wall, into the necropolis itself. patrick, though, just as concerned with cinnabar as with himself, yelling at her across the crib.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{cinnabar! stop!}
<A>__{but cinnabar doesn't even turn her head. she just steps into her father's embrace. but pearl does seem to hear something. she looks back at patrick, beneath the illusion of the room she sees him being pulled into the awful wall, and can hear him more clearly now.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{no! cinnabar, no!!!!}
<A>__{slowly, pearl turns and looks into the mirror and she gets a full length view of herself: a woman in ruined tatters of her old, rotted dress. then, coming into her view in the mirror is her only daughter dancing with a decayed corpse.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{noooooo!}
<A>__{pearl whirls and rips cinnabar away from bones, who at first sort of chuckles to himself. but he stops laughing when pearl grabs the nearest candle and presses the flame to her breast. in a terrible whoosh, the dried old dress and pearl are engulfed in flames.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{noooooooooo!!!!!}
<A>__{bones runs to pearl and throws his arms around her, trying to smother the flames any way he can.}
<C>__{pearl}
<P>__{(to patrick and cinnabar)}
<D>__{get out!!! go!!!}
<A>__{cinnabar in a shattered daze on the floor, sees her mother in flames. patrick desperately tries to escape his father's death grip. finally, with horrible sound, patrick wrestles free from the wall, and from his father. he lurches free from them and makes it over to cinnabar and drags her out the door just as the room dissolves around them. as the flames destroy the dress and the last vestiges of bones' blood on it, the room begins to turn to ash. an eerie wind from nowhere begins to howl, blowing the ash and smoke from the dress and from the dissolving walls. cinnabar taking one last glance at the funeral pyre that was her mother and bones now, too, sees them almost lost in a shroud of flame and ash.}
<B>__{angle as}
<A>__{patrick and cinnabar run down the corridor and back down the stairs, the moon overhead and the flames from bones crib giving everything a flickering hellish cat. everything behind and above them crumbling to dust. the floor and then the stairs and all the howling bodies trapped inside.}
<B>__{on the first floor}
<A>__{they reach the open elevator shaft.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{we gotta jump!}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{i can't!}
<A>__{everything around them rumbling and crumbling.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{we have to!}
<A>__{patrick jumps and lands in the muddy ashes, dazed but unhurt.}
<B>__{looking up}
<A>__{he sees cinnabar peering over the edge in fear. then, behind her, he can hear a low rumbling growl. he sees cinnabar turn and scream ashes and falling debris then temporarily blind hen he wipes his eyes and looks up, cinnabar is gone from view.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{cinnabar! where are you!?}
<A>__{he immediately climbs back up the shaft when he sees cinnabar standing at the edge of the shaft above him.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{cinn! jump!!}
<A>__{and she jumps, landing right next to patrick, who quickly gets her to her feet.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{let's go!!!}
<A>__{they run out of the shaft and into the sub basement just as the elevator and shaft dissolve into ash. a hurricane wind blowing down and out of the shaft now. mixed with the sound of all the screaming, moaning souls in the necropolis. patrick in a fury to live tears away the boards and debris blocking the exit. he pulls cinnabar out with him and they walk up the cellar stairs, step into the dawn, weary, beaten down but not dead.}
<L>__{exterior bones' building day}
<A>__{they've made it out of the inferno. like dante said "thus we emerged again to see the stars." no stars here, just the glorious dawn. patrick stops, feels the new sun on his face. breathes clean air again for the first time.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{we made it...}
<A>__{then from behind or above or somewhere we can hear what might be a low, low chuckle. jimmy bones' chuckle.}
<C>__{bones }
<D>__{dog eat dog, boy. dog eat dog...}
<A>__{patrick turns and spins in mounting horror. there, behind him, right where cinnabar was standing... the black dog. it leaps right at the camera, filling the frame with huge teeth and bloody red tongue. we freeze.}
