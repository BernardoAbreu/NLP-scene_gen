<A>__{aaron starts the car as jessica lights her cigarette. without warning, as jessica takes a drag, aaron punches jessica square in the jaw. the lit cigarette flies out of jessica's mouth, and jessica falls out of view. aaron reaches down, grabs the cigarette and puts it in his mouth, still angry. he slowly pulls the car out of the back yard and toward the street, passing jimmy's piece of shit parked in the opposite direction. the engine is still off. jimmy is sitting still behind the wheel, hands down in his lap, staring straight ahead. pull in and hold on jimmy.}
