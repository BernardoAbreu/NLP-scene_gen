<B>__{the grapes of wrath}
<D>__{"the grapes of wrath" screenplay by nunnally johnson based on the novel "the grapes of wrath" by john steinbeck}
<A>__{an oklahoma paved highway in daylight. at some distance, hoofing down the highway, comes tom joad. he wears a new stiff suit of clothes, ill fitting, and a stiff new cap, which he gradually manages to break down into something comfortable. he comes down the left side of the road, the better to watch the cars that pass him. as he approaches, the scene changes to a roadside short order restaurant on the right side of the road. from it comes the sound of a phonograph playing a 1939 popular song. in front of the eatery is a huge diesel truck labeled: oklahoma city transport company. the driver, a heavy man with army breeches and high laced boots, comes out of the restaurant, the screen door slamming behind him. he is chewing on a toothpick. a waitress appears at the door, behind the screen.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{when you be back?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{couple a weeks. don't do nothin' you wouldn't want me to hear about!}
<A>__{we see him climbing into the cab of the truck from the right side. getting behind the wheel, he is releasing the handbrake when tom appears at the driver's seat window.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{how about a lift, mister?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{can't you see that sticker?}
<A>__{he indicates a "no riders" sticker on the windshield.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{sure i see it. but a good guy don't pay no attention to what some heel makes him stick on his truck.}
<A>__{after a moment of hesitation the driver releases the brake.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{scrunch down on the running board till we get around the bend.}
<A>__{as tom scrunches down on the running board the driver throws the truck into gear and it moves. the scene dissolves to the cab of the truck. it is day, and tom is seated beside the driver, who is surreptitiously eyeing him, trying to confirm some suspicion an inspection which tom ignores at first.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{goin' far?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{just a few miles. i'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{lookin' for a job?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{no, my old man got a place, forty acres. he's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.}
<C>__{driver}
<P>__{(after a curious glance)}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{cautiously, the driver's eyes drop to tom's feet. we see tom's shoes. they are prison shoes new, stiff and bulky. curiosity is in the eyes of the driver as they shoot a swift glance at tom. tom is looking straight ahead, with the dead pan look that prisoners get when they are trying to conceal something. the driver's eyes take in tom's hands and the stiff coat.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{been doin' a job?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{i seen your hands. you been swinging a pick or a sledge that shines up your hands. i notice little things like that all the time.}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{got a trade?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(evenly)}
<D>__{why don't you get to it, buddy?}
<C>__{driver}
<P>__{(uneasily)}
<D>__{get to what?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you know what i mean. you been givin' me a goin' over ever since i got in. whyn't you go on and ask me where i been?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{i don't stick my nose in nobody's business.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{naw not much!}
<C>__{driver}
<P>__{(a little frightened)}
<D>__{i stay in my own yard.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(without emotion)}
<D>__{listen. that big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. but i ain't keepin' it a secret. i been in the penitentiary. been there four years. like to know anything else?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{you ain't got to get sore.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{go ahead. ask me anything you want.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{i didn't mean nothing.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{me neither. i'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{see that road up ahead?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{that's where i get off.}
<A>__{with a sigh of relief the driver puts his foot on the brake. the truck stops and tom gets out. he look at the uneasy driver contemptuously.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you're about to bust to know what i done, ain't you? well, i ain't a guy to let you down.}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{homicide!}
<A>__{the driver throws the truck into gear. he doesn't like this at all.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{i never asked you!}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(as the truck moves away)}
<D>__{sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if i hadn't tol' you.}
<A>__{he looks indifferently after the truck and then starts on foot down the dirt crossroad. a wind has begun to blow. the scene dissolves to the roadside under a willow tree in daylight. the wind is still blowing. sitting on the ground, his back against the tree, casy, a long, lean man in overalls, blue shirt, and one sneaker, is fixing something on the other dirty sneaker. to the tune of "yes, sir, that's my baby" he is absent mindedly singing.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{mmmmm he's my saviour. mmmmm my saviour, mmmmmmmmmm my saviour now.}
<P>__{(looking up as tom comes down the road)}
<D>__{howdy, friend.}
<A>__{carrying his coat under his arm, tom wipes his face with his cap as he cuts off the road to acknowledge the greeting.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{howdy.}
<A>__{he stops, grateful for the momentary relief of the shade.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{say, ain't you young tom joad ol' tom's boy?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{yeah. on my way home now.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{well, i do declare!}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{i baptized you, son.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(staring)}
<D>__{why, you're the preacher!}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{used to be. not no more. i lost the call.}
<P>__{(reminiscently)}
<D>__{but boy, i sure used to have it! i'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners i pretty near drowned half of 'em!}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{but not no more. i lost the sperit.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(with a grin)}
<D>__{pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{i got nothin' to preach about no more that's all. i ain't so sure o' things.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{maybe you should a got yourself a wife.}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(shakes his head sadly)}
<D>__{at my meetin's i used to get the girls glory shoutin' till they about passed out. then, i'd go to comfort 'em and always end up by lovin' 'em. i'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. next time, do it again. i figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i never let one go by me when i could catch her.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{but you wasn't a preacher. a girl was just a girl to you. but to me they was holy vessels. i was savin' their souls.}
<P>__{(fervently)}
<D>__{i ast myself what is this call, the holy sperit? maybe that's love. why, i love everybody so much i'm fit to bust sometimes! so maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. there's just what people do. some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. but that's as far as any man's got a right to say.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(after a moment,}
<D>__{figuring there is no percentage in continuing this philosophical discussion, pulls out a flask, which}
<P>__{he extends)}
<D>__{have a little snort?}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(holding the flask)}
<D>__{course i will say grace if somebody sets out the food }
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{ but my heart ain't in it.}
<P>__{(he takes a long pull)}
<D>__{nice drinkin' liquor.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{ought to be. that's fact'ry liquor. cost me a buck.}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(handing back the flask)}
<D>__{been out travelin' around?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{didn't you hear? it was in the papers.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{no, i never. what?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i been in the penitentiary for four years.}
<P>__{(he drinks)}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{excuse me for asking.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i don't mind any more. i'd do what i done again. i killed a guy at a dance. we was drunk. he got a knife in me and i laid him out with a shovel. knocked his head plumb to squash.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{and you ain't ashamed?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{he had a knife in me. that's why they only gave me seven years. got out in four parole.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{ain't you seen your folks since then?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(putting on his coat)}
<D>__{no, but i aim to before sundown. gettin' kind of excited about it, too. which way you going?}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(putting on his sneaker)}
<D>__{it don't matter. ever since i lost the sperit it looks like i just as soon go one way as the other.}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{i will go your way.}
<A>__{they pause at the edge of the shade, squint up at the sky, and then move off. the scene dissolves to the surface of a dirt road by daylight. leaves are scuttling across it. the top soil begins to fly up. it is not a hard wind as yet, but it is steady and persistent. tom's and casy's feet walk into sight.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{maybe ma'll have pork for supper. i ain't had pork but four times in four years every christmas.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{i will be glad to see you pa. last time i seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the holy sperit i ever seen. he go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog wolf in moon time. fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. they was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' i give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more holy sperit in your pa after that.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(worriedly)}
<D>__{lissen. this wind's fixin't to do somepin'!}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{shore it is. it always is, this time a year.}
<A>__{tom, holding his cap on his head with his hand, looks up... the tops of the trees are bending before the wind. tom and casy continue walking.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{is it fur?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(still looking back)}
<D>__{just around that next bend.}
<A>__{tom and casy are almost being blown along and dust is rising from the road.}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(lifting his voice above the wind)}
<D>__{your granma was a great one, too. the third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full growed deacon with her fist.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(pointing ahead)}
<D>__{that's our place.}
<A>__{the joad cabin is an ancient, bleak, sway backed building. there is neither sign of life or habitation about it.}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(looking back)}
<D>__{and it ain't any too close, either! we better run!}
<A>__{a dust storm, like a black wall, rises into the sky, moving forward. tom and casy are running, but looking back over their shoulders as the dust storm nears. dust rises from the ground to join and thicken the black wall. tom and casy are seen racing down the road to the cabin, the wind whipping up the dust. the two men smack open the door and slam it shut after them. the screen begins to grow dark as the storm sweeps over the land. it becomes black. in the cabin, it is black too, but the sound is different. in addition to the sound of the wind there is the soft hissing of sand against the house.}
<C>__{tom's voice}
<D>__{ma?... pa?... ain't nobody here?}
<P>__{(after a long silence)}
<D>__{somepin's happened.}
<C>__{casy's voice}
<D>__{you got a match?}
<C>__{tom's voice}
<D>__{there was some pieces of candle always on a shelf.}
<A>__{presently, after shuffling about, he has found them and lights one. he holds it up, lighting the room. a couple of wooden boxes are on the floor, a few miserable discarded things, and that's all. tom's eyes are bewildered.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{they're all gone or dead.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{they never wrote you nothing?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{no. they wasn't people to write.}
<A>__{from the floor he picks up a woman's high button shoe, curled up at the toe and broken over the instep.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this was ma's. had 'em for years.}
<A>__{dropping the shoe, he picks up a battered felt hat.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this used to be mine. i give it to grampa when i went away.}
<P>__{(to casy)}
<D>__{you reckon they could be dead?}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{i never heard nothin' about it.}
<A>__{dropping the hat, he moves with the candle toward the door to the back, the only other room of the cabin. he stands in the doorway, holding the candle high. in the back room the scene moves from tom at the door across the room to the shadows, where a skinny little man sits motionless, wide eyed, staring at tom. his name is muley.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{tommy?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(entering)}
<D>__{muley! where's my folks, muley?}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(dully)}
<D>__{they gone.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{i know that! but where they gone?}
<A>__{muley does not reply. he is looking up at casy as he enters.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(to casy)}
<D>__{this is muley graves.}
<P>__{(to muley)}
<D>__{you remember the preacher, don't you?}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{i ain't no preacher anymore.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{all right, you remember the man then.}
<C>__{muley and casy}
<D>__{glad to see you again. glad to see you.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{now where is my folks?}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{gone }
<P>__{(hastily)}
<D>__{ over to your uncle john's. the whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. but they can't stay there either, because john's got his notice to get off.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{but what's happened? how come they got to get off? we been here fifty years same place.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{ever'body got to get off. ever'body leavin', goin' to california. my folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{ever'body but me. i ain't gettin' off.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{but who done it?}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{listen!}
<P>__{(impatiently tom listens to the storm)}
<D>__{that's some of what done it the dusters. started it, anyway. blowin' like this, year after year blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{are you crazy?}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{some say i am.}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{you want to hear what happened?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{that's what i asked you, ain't it?}
<A>__{muley is seen at close range. not actually crazy, muley is a little touched. his eyes rove upward as he listens to the sound of the storm, the sough of the wind and the soft hiss of the sand. then...}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{the way it happens the way it happened to me the man come one day...}
<A>__{the scene dissolves to muley's dooryard. it is a soft spring day, with the peaceful sounds of the country. seated in a three year old touring car is the man, a city man with a collar and tie. he hates to do what he is doing and this makes him gruff and curt, to hide his misgivings. squatted beside the car are muley, his son in law, and a half grown son. at a respectful distance stand muley's wife, his daughter, with a baby in her arms, and a small barefooted girl, watching worriedly. the men soberly trace marks on the ground with small sticks. a hound dog sniffs at the automobile wheels.}
<C>__{the man}
<D>__{fact of the matter, muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. it don't even break even, much less show a profit. one man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. you just pay him a wage and take all the crop.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{but we couldn't do on any less'n what our share is now.}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{the chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.}
<C>__{the man}
<P>__{(irritably)}
<D>__{i can't help that. all i know is i got my orders. they told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what i'm telling you.}
<A>__{muley stands in anger. the two younger men pattern after him.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{you mean get off my own land?}
<C>__{the man}
<D>__{now don't go blaming me. it ain't my fault.}
<C>__{son}
<D>__{whose fault is it?}
<C>__{the man}
<D>__{you know who owns the land the shawnee land and cattle company.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{who's the shawnee land and cattle comp'ny?}
<C>__{the man}
<D>__{it ain't nobody. it's a company.}
<C>__{son}
<D>__{they got a pres'dent, ain't they? they got somebody that knows what a shotgun's for, ain't they?}
<C>__{the man}
<D>__{but it ain't his fault, because the bank tells him what to do.}
<C>__{son}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{all right. where's the bank?}
<C>__{the man}
<P>__{(fretfully)}
<D>__{tulsa. but what's the use of picking on him? he ain't anything but the manager, and half crazy hisself, trying to keep up with his orders from the east!}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{then who do we shoot?}
<C>__{the man}
<P>__{(stepping on the starter)}
<D>__{brother, i don't know. if i did i'd tell you. but i just don't know who's to blame!}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{well, i'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't nobody going to push me off my land! grampa took up this land seventy years ago. my pa was born here. we was all born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. and that's what makes it ourn bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! so just come on and try to push me off!}
<A>__{the scene dissolves to the back room. the sound of the storm is heard again as tom and casy watch muley.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(without emotion)}
<D>__{they come. they come and pushed me off.}
<A>__{we see muley at close range.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{they come with the cats.}
<C>__{tom's voice}
<D>__{the what?}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{the cats the caterpillar tractors.}
<A>__{the scene dissolves to a montage of tractors: tractors looming over hillocks, flattening fences, through gullies, their drivers looking like robots, with goggles, dust masks over mouth and nose one after the other, crossing and recrossing as if to convey the impression that this was an invasion of machine men from some other world.}
<C>__{muley's voice}
<D>__{and for ever' one of 'em ten fifteen families gets throwed outa their homes one hundred folks with no place to live but on the road. the rances, the perrys, the peterses, the joadses one after another they got throwed out. half the folks you and me know throwed right out into the road. the one that got me come a month ago.}
<A>__{the scene dissolves to muley's farm. we see the backs of muley and the two younger men standing shoulder to shoulder watching a lumbering tractor headed straight toward them. it is at some distance. muley holds a shotgun. his son has a baling hook. the son in law has a two by four. behind them is their cabin. frightened and huddled together are the women and children. the roar of the tractor comes closer.}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{you come any closer and i'm gonna blow you right outa that cat!}
<P>__{(he lifts his shotgun)}
<A>__{the tractor continues to lumber along, its driver goggled and black of face where his dust mask doesn't cover. muley lifts his shotgun to his shoulder, and aims.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{i tol' you!}
<A>__{the tractor stops. the driver takes off his goggles and dust mask. like the others he's a country boy. his face is sullen. muley is lowering his shotgun. there is a surprise in his face as he recognizes the driver.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{why, you're joe davis's boy!}
<A>__{he moves forward, followed by his son and son in law in the tractor. davis is wiping his face as they walk toward him.}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{i don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{then what are you doin' this kind a thing for against your own people?}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{for three dollars a day, that's what i'm doin' it for. i got two little kids. i got a wife and my wife's mother. them people got to eat. fust and on'y thing i got to think about is my own folks. what happens to other folks is their lookout.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{but this is my land, son. don't you understand?}
<C>__{davis}
<P>__{(putting his goggles back on)}
<D>__{used to be your land. b'longs to the comp'ny now.}
<A>__{we see the womenfolks. a small girl pulls her mother's dress.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{what's he fixin' to do, ma?}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{hush!}
<A>__{back to the tractor and the men:}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat i'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.}
<C>__{davis}
<P>__{(contemptuously)}
<D>__{you ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. first place, you'd get hung and you know it. for another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.}
<A>__{and the tractor roars into slow motion again... we see the house and tractor. the womenfolks scamper out of the way as the tractor heads for a corner of the house. it goes over a ramshackle fence and then a feeble little flower bed. muley and the two younger men walk along. breathing hard, frightened and desperate, muley is shouting warnings at davis, but the roar of the tractor drowns his voice. the dog barks excitedly, snarling at the tractor. the womenfolks stand watching, terrified but dead pan, until a cry bursts from muley's wife.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{don't! please don't!}
<A>__{the little girl begins to whimper.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{i'm tellin' you!}
<A>__{the tractor moves across the yard, nosing a chair out of the way, and with a rending of boards hits a corner of the house, knocking a part of the foundation away. the corner of the house sinks. muley lifts his shotgun, aims it, holds it, and then slowly lowers it. as he stands looking at what has happened his shoulders sag. he seems almost to shrink. the scene dissolves to muley, once more in the back room of tom's old home, as the sound of the storm continues.}
<C>__{muley}
<P>__{(dully)}
<D>__{what was the use. he was right. there wasn't a thing in the world i could do about it.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{but it don't seem possible kicked off like that!}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{the rest of my fambly set out for the west there wasn't nothin' to eat but i couldn't leave. somepin' wouldn't let me. so now i just wander around. sleep wherever i am. i used to tell myself i was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. but i knowed that wan't true. there ain't nothin' to look out for. and ain't nobody comin' back. they're gone and me, i'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost that's all in the world i am.}
<A>__{tom rises in his agitation and bewilderment.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{you think i'm touched.}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(sympathetically)}
<D>__{no. you're lonely but you ain't touched.}
<C>__{muley}
<D>__{it don't matter. if i'm touched, i'm touched, and that's all there is to it.}
