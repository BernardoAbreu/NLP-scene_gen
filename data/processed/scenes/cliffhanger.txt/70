<L>__{exterior mountain aerial shot day}
<A>__{the next obstacle hal is leading the gang through is a buttress a large, stark boulder formation that lays between the mountain they've just come from, and the nearest mountain to it: the tower. this is lower down from the summit it's solid and treeless. hal and the rest of the expedition is totally exposed as they climb in single file up to the top. terrain is flat enough that the climb amount to an uphill run on all fours.}
<B>__{closer on hal and gang}
<A>__{hal leads the gang forward and keeps casting anxious glances back at them. and beyond them. travers notices this.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{forget about it. he's smart, but he's not invisible.}
<A>__{hal looks back. travers is right. there's absolutely no way gabe can come up behind them without being seen.}
<B>__{lower down on bluff}
<A>__{where the bluff meets a tree lined plain. gabe, in hiding, watches hal and the others go up. no, he can't follow them up the bluff's side without being seen. but gabe moves closer to the bluff's base gabe shoves through some trees to the beginning of the "chimney" a crevice runs the entire length and breadth of the bluff.}
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{pulls out his ancient binoculars, and scans the crack. gabe's pov the chimney starting with an outside view, we can see that the crevice runs all the way up, and through, the bluff but it's a zig zag, not a straight line. picture a mine shaft designed by a madman. the crack moves upward, then erratically to the side, then straight up again. the width of the crack is uneven, ranging from six inches to six feet. and that's just how it looks on the outside. there's no telling what the interior is like. gabe turns the binoculars to the inside of the crack. it's hard to see much it's very, very dark. but it looks as if the crack goes all the way through the bluff, as well as all the way up it. on this route, gabe can tunnel through the mountain instead of going up the side.}
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{puts away the binoculars and wedges himself into the crack, starting the long process of going up and through the mountain formation.}
