<L>__{interior police headquarters day}
<A>__{phones are ringing off the hook. reilly bursts in, notices winters directing an army of cops setting up sophisticated tracing equipment.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{let's go, we gotta jump on him the second he calls again.}
<A>__{reilly discreetly crosses the room but is intercepted by pluchinsky.}
<C>__{pluchinsky}
<D>__{you were lucky today, vice boy. captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, i'm watching you.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{i'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.}
<A>__{pluchinsky's face turns red with rage as... an officer holds up a phone urgently.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{captain, it's him!}
<A>__{the room scrambles into action as winters grabs the phone. swan's voice crackles over the squawk box.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{winters here.}
<C>__{swan's voice}
<D>__{don't make me send another.}
<C>__{winters}

<A>__{click, dial tone.}
<C>__{winters }
<D>__{hello? hello?}
<A>__{winters slams down the receiver. cops pull off their tracing headphones, glance at each other uneasily.}
<C>__{winters }
<D>__{section commanders, in my office, now.}
<A>__{as the room erupts, reilly turns to the booking officer.}
<C>__{reilly}
