<L>__{exterior west side street night}
<A>__{sammael runs past a group of trick or treaters, and jumps straight into the street. cars swerve, avoiding a collision as sammael lands on the opposite sidewalk. the trick or treaters scream. hellboy appears. he too dives straight into the traffic as myers follows he runs into the road... and a 4x4 speeds straight at him! seeing this, hellboy runs back, and lands next to myers, holds out his stone hand and stops the 4x4 dead in its tracks. the impact somersaults the car over them both. it lands with a thud on the street, air bags exploding. myers almost faints. other cars stop, tires squealing and horns blaring. a major traffic jam.}
