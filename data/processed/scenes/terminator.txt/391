<A>__{c.u. sarah, brightly lit by daylight. asleep. she grimaces and groans. in the distance a dog is barking. reese, still holding her, lightly lifts her hair from her face. an uncharacteristically tender gesture. he gently caresses her cheek with the backs of his fingers. when she awakens suddenly he snaps his hand away. sarah looks around, momentarily disoriented. looks up at reese.}
