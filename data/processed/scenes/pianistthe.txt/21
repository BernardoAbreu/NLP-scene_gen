<T>__{a series of shots:}
<B>__{the wall. the wall. the wall.}
<L>__{exterior market area, ghetto day}
<A>__{winter. cold, freezing day. slush underfoot. great activity. people selling shoes, clothes, carpets, curtains, food. a woman offers cakes under a barbed wire cover. noise, bustle, restless wing and froing. among the traders, henryk, slightly shabbier now, and at his feet a basket with books. he holds a couple of volumes in his hands, trying to interest passers by. szpilman, also a little shabbier, wends his way through the setters and buyers, the beggars, the passers by, and reaches henryk. henryk drops the two volumes into the basket, takes a handle one side of the basket, szpilman the other. they set off. as they walk, carrying the basket between them, passing beggars and children asking for food:}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{you sell anything?}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{just one. dostoevsky. the idiot. three zlotys.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{that's better than yesterday.}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{three lousy zlotys. and there are people here making millions.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{you don't know, believe me. they bribe the guards. the guards turn a blind eye. they're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, french cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.}
<A>__{suddenly, a woman appears in front of them, barring their way. she's brightly rouged with thickly painted eyebrows, dressed in an old green velvet curtain with an unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat.}
<C>__{the feather woman}
<D>__{excuse me, but have you by any chance seen my husband izaak szerman?}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{i'm afraid not.}
<C>__{the feather woman}
<D>__{a tall handsome man with a little grey beard?}
<A>__{they shake their heads.}
<C>__{the feather woman}
<D>__{no?}
<P>__{(she is near to}
<D>__{tears, then smiles}
<P>__{artificially.)}
<D>__{oh, do forgive me.}
<P>__{(as she goes)}
<D>__{goodbye, sleep well, if you see him, please do write, izaak szerman's his name...}
<A>__{she wanders on. szpilman and henryk, too, continue on their way. and as they go:}
<C>__{henryk}
<D>__{sometimes i wish i could go mad.}
