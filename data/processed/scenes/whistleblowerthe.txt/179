<A>__{it's more of a medium sized hall. a bar, some tables and a few `home touches'. maps of yugoslavia. pictures of tito. and full of iptf. raya walks through, ogled. she sees... luba, sitting on mara's lap. surrounded by ten irish soldiers. the soldiers ply them with drinks, `winning' them with charm. luba blends in with remarkable ease.}

<A>__{rory, irish, grabs raya's hand.}

<P>__{(forcing) yes... of course.}
<A>__{he leads her to the back of the bar. raya looks to luba, but realizes she is alone. they walk through a back door into a room full of beds separated with curtains. we barely make out the shapes of various soldiers with girls in each cubicle. all busy. until a curtain opens... and jim higgins walks out. his rite of passage complete. rory pulls raya to the cubicle, as julia comes out.}
