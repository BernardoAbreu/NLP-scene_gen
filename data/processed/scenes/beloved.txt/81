<T>__{memory:}
<L>__{exterior sweet home day.}
<B>__{paul has a bit in his mouth chained to a wagon.}
<A>__{he is being lead away from sweet home with other black men, by three white men. the bit jerks his head back, saliva spills uncontrollably out of his mouth. his hands are chained behind him. his feet chained together at the ankles....another chain is connected to an iron belt and stretches to a wagon. he is being lead away with forty five other prisoners...}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{i tried to kill brandywine man schoolteacher sold me to. don't know what possessed me...me and about 45 other prisoners were being walked from kentucky to virginia...then on to georgia. two places i don't ever want to see again.}
<A>__{he is lead past the milk shed, when he sees: halle, alone with a crazed faraway look in his eyes, sitting by the butter churn. halle's face is covered with butter and clabber. he sticks his hands in the churn and continues to cover his face with the sticky, slippery, white substance covering his face and head, squeezing it through his hands. the white men laugh. paul is aching to scream out to him but the iron bit holds down his tongue. as paul is lead past halle, a rooster named mister is sitting on a tub in the sun shrieks with an almost arrogant glee.}
<C>__{white man}
<D>__{look at mister there...}
<P>__{(referring to the rooster)}
<D>__{you go tell these niggers where to go there mister! crow'em right outta here!}
<A>__{mister crows and the white men laugh. tears of rage and humiliation stream down paul's face. he struggles to keep a view of halle, until he is out of sight.}
<B>__{end of memory.}
