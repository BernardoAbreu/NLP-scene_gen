<A>__{julius and zira cross to a stout, imposing orangutan who has just entered the laboratory. julius bows to him. this is dr. zaius. like the other apes, he wears a simple tunic and trousers, but his garments are of a costlier material, and several decorations are woven into the sash of his tunic.}

<P>__{(bubbling)}
<D>__{dr. zaius, i'm so glad you could come. he's over here.}
<A>__{zaius crosses with them to taylor's cage. beneath his austere manner, we sense tension, worry. zira looks up at taylor, her tone an appeal.}
