<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior crossroads a short time later}
<A>__{ronnie looks petrified as he stands guard. a bum stands off to the side staring ronnie down. ronnie waves to the bum. the bum runs his finger under his throat. ronnie tries to ignore him. a group of kids walk by ronnie talking loudly.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{hey, no horse play. you guys get on home.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{you want some crack?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no, i don't want any crack. in fact, i didn't want to do this, but you leave me no choice in the matter. i'm placing you under citizen's arrest.}
<A>__{ronnie grabs the little kid by the shoulders to restrain him.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{let me go, motherfucker!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i place you under citizen's arrest for the crime of selling a schedule 1 narcotic. you have the right to remain silent...}
<A>__{unbeknownst to ronnie, gang members start walking up behind him. it's like that scene in training day where all the gangsters are hanging out right across the street with guns and shit. they come up behind him as he speaks to the kids...}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{... if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you. now i guess we just wait here for my ride to come back.}
<A>__{ronnie turns around to look for harrison's return, but instead he sees that he is surrounded by a large group of pissed off gang members.}
<D>__{gang member #1 that's my little brother you got there.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{who, this little guy right here? gang member #1 that's right.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well, i hate to be the one to tell you this, but it appears that your little brother has tried to sell me illegal drugs. i know it's hard for you to hear that. gang member #1 he works for me, motherfucker!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{is that so? well then, it looks like you got one less employee because i'm taking little brother down. i will die right here before i let crime prevail.}
<A>__{the gang members all pull out their guns and point them at ronnie.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(to the little kid)}
<D>__{free to go, little brother. my mistake completely. good luck with the crack.}
<A>__{the little kid runs off.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{alright, so i guess i will be seeing you folks.}
<A>__{the gang members stand in ronnie's way and cock their guns.}
<D>__{gang member #2 yo, waste this pig, tone.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{oh, no. that's really not necessary, tone. gang member #2 do it, man.}
<A>__{gang member #1 puts the gun right up to ronnie's head.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{oh, jesus, i don't want to die. don't let me die, don't do it!}
<A>__{ronnie goes down on his knees.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no, please! i'm sorry!}
<A>__{ronnie reaches into his boot and pulls out a small rod. he flips his wrist and it extends into a night stick. ronnie's begging was a trap. ronnie pops up and begins dropping all those motherfuckers with lightning fast precision. ronnie breaks arms and busts heads like a fucking ninja. gang member #1 comes in and hits ronnie with a sucker punch, busting his nose wide open. ronnie stands up and goes mano y mano in a fist fight with gang member #1. he starts kicking ronnie's ass. ronnie goes down again and gang member #1 starts stomping ronnie. ronnie grabs gang member #1's leg and twists it. he takes him down. ronnie jumps on top of him and begins beating him senseless. slow motion: ronnie stands up and looks around at the pool of beaten bodies. this is ronnie at his most primal and also at his best.}
