<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i have not no bird these many days. what kind of a bird?}
<C>__{plaice}
<D>__{a sort of albatross i believe, or perhaps a prodigious great mew. he has been following the ship since... there he is, crossing our wake!}
<L>__{224. on the gangway day}
<A>__{stephen runs along the gangway to get a clearer view, checking himself when he sees jack on the quarterdeck. their eyes meet. the quarterdeck is jack's domain now, and stephen avoids it. then, behind jack, the great bird suddenly appears. it's huge, with at least a fourteen foot wing span, and flying very close to the ship, drifting and soaring on the gusting wind, appearing and disappearing between the sails. stephen is mesmerized by it. he lets go of the rail, leaning forward to get a better view. at the same time across from stephen on the opposite gangway, howard and two or three marines open fire on the bird. the bird drops low, flying right by stephen. again a crackle of gunfire, but the bird is apparently uninjured, and it banks away, skimming the surface of the water. stephen sags to the deck. a shout. people running. blood spreading across the white of his shirt. howard there by his side.}

<C>__{stephen}

<A>__{he tries to stand, crumples.}
