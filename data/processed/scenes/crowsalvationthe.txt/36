<A>__{mercer is peering through the double barred gate at the end of the row as alex emerges from his former cell.}
<C>__{mercer}
<P>__{(still into radio)}
<D>__{get me some backup. we got one loose on the row.}
<P>__{(through the bars to alex)}
<D>__{now who the fuck are you?}
<A>__{alex looks up, sees mercer and flash... alex's internal pov a pop of mercer bringing the birthday cake. a wash of flame, twenty one candles. a blip of walsh. of a white king. resume alex perplexed, looking at the cake still littering the floor of his ex cell, candles melted down. mercer works his way through the double barred doors onto the row.}
<C>__{mercer }
<D>__{and what have you done to your face there beauty queen?}
<A>__{the inmate occupying the cell next to alex's peers out through the bars, vanishes again as mercer whops the bars once with his nightstick.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's my birthday.}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{yeah, well... here's a present for you.}
<A>__{whoosh. mercer swings his nightstick at alex's head. alex catches it, instinctively in one hand. mercer reaches for... a red panic button hanging off his guard belt. mercer slams it. favoring alex lets go of the stick, looks at his own hand, surprised. wham! mercer broadsides alex's head with the stick. alex goes down shocked, not from pain, from the fact that someone would attack him. wham wham wham. mercer brutalizes alex, collapsed at his feet as... two guards enter the far end of the row, race toward alex's cell, one holding a taser. its laser sight finds alex, crumpled in front of mercer.}
<C>__{mercer }
<D>__{it's ok. man. had me going there.}
<A>__{looks like it's over. the guards relax. alex suddenly looks up at mercer. zero damage from the blows.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{go ahead. make a wish.}
<C>__{mercer}
<D>__{taser!}
<A>__{alex wheels around as guard one squeezes the trigger. crowvision the taser darts speed toward camera. resume alex shunts himself to the side and the taser darts impale themselves in mercer's thighs. he drops fibrillating. a cheer goes up from the men in their cells, who become progressively rowdier as the guards bolt and alex follows, strength in his stride, nightstick in hand. pieces of flaming toiletpaper flung now from the cells of deathrow. at the far entrance the two guards scramble to get the door closed behind them before alex catches up. they'd make it except alex hurls... the nightstick flying end over end like a throwing knife, catching the trailing guard in the back of the head, dropping him in the door, propping it open. alex enters the cage entrance to deathrow, sharing the space with the guard still standing.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(pats pockets, then)}
<D>__{keys?}
<A>__{the frightened guard opens the door into the next hallway and bolts. leaving the keys. the crow hopping, screaming...}
