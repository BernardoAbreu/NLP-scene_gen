<L>__{interior world of donuts day}
<A>__{henry paces back and forth. with the fingers of one hand pressed against his forehead and his eyes closed tight in concentration, he dictates to amy, who is sitting at a table with her laptop computer, typing his every word.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{in the infinite amplitude of his love, god wants to create the largest number of best elements that can exist together in one cosmos... ok.}
<A>__{amy types away, fascinated by henry's intelligence.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{in an instantaneous calculation made in eternity, god computes the best possible world and creates it. fine. this 'decision' by god is uncontingent and eternal rather than temporally or ontologically sequential.}
<A>__{stops, zeroing in on his pointerior}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{how do you spell that?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{ontologically.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{o n t... don't you have some kinda spell check on that thing?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{never mind.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{it is impossible for every perfect good to be compatible with every other perfect good. the intense beauty of the mountain must be set off by the fertility of the plain, so to speak.}
<A>__{he smokes, drinks, paces some more. amy waits with bated breath, devastated by his obscure profundity. he comes back and sits beside her, reaching his conclusion.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{the good of freewill must entail real choices for sin.}
<A>__{she gazes at his profile, in love. henry sits thinking and amy watches him reverently. she leans over close and whispers in his ear. he turns and looks at her, alarmed.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{listen, amy, back off. i'm on parole.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you feel the same way. i can tell. i can see it when you look at me.}
<A>__{henry jumps up and looks around, paranoid. he keeps his voice down and points at her.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{hey! i don't look at you.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{yes you do. in the street. in the parking lot yesterday. that night on the highway.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i look at a lot of people that way.}
<A>__{disappointed, amy turns away and sulks.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you think i'm stupid.}
<A>__{henry sees she's genuinely upset and feels bad. he sits back down and lays his hand on hers.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{no, as a matter of fact, i think you're a real bright kid and i like that about you.}
<C>__{amy}
<P>__{(looks up, pouts)}
<D>__{you do?}
<A>__{now henry tries to scare her away. he leers at her.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i like it so much i've got half a mind to do perverse things to you. right here. right now. things you might just learn to like.}
<A>__{she just stares at him, blinks, then looks away and tries to imagine this. she takes her laptop and leaves, confused and blushing. henry watches her go and grins, satisfied with himself.}
