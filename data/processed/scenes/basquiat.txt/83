<C>__{andy warhol}
<D>__{i think it's in new jersey.}
<C>__{jack milo}
<D>__{it's in new york.}
<C>__{andy warhol}
<D>__{oh, i didn't know that.}
<A>__{close up: jean smiles at andy's diplomacy. albert finishes drawing his portrait: it's francesco with his arm around a headless torso.}
<C>__{albert milo}
<P>__{(to francesco)}
<D>__{you finish it.}
<A>__{he pushes the book across the table. francesco begins to draw.}
<C>__{mary boone}
<P>__{(to jean)}
<D>__{i hear your show was sold out already. there's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{bring him over sometime. i have some other stuff to show him.}
<A>__{annina watches from the other table as jean talks to mary. francesco finishes his drawing. albert takes the book and passes it to jean.}
<C>__{albert milo }
<D>__{go on, take it..}
<A>__{jean takes it. mr. chow watches his book change hands. jean takes a bowl of moo shoo pork in front of him and dumps it onto the book. then he uses a piece of pork to draw a head. suddenly, there's a shrill, familiar voice.}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{i'd like a glass of your best champagne, please?}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{this is an enormously important season in new york, and to make a false step could have severe repercussions for years. we are no longer collecting art, we're buying individuals.}
<C>__{andy warhol}
<D>__{oh shut up, rene.}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{everything's over your head, andy. even mr. chow's menu.}
<P>__{(beat to jean)}
<D>__{thanks for not inviting me}
<A>__{he leans over everyone and helps himself to some spears of asparagus.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{esther milo, watching.}
<C>__{rene }
<D>__{i'm starving. you can't buy advertising like this. this is the most glamorous dinner you'll have here this fall. how about some of that imitation crab?}
<C>__{mr. chow}
<D>__{i'm not paying for the drawing with crab. it's a present to my friends. it's my birthday.}
<A>__{jean finishes his drawing a big beautiful head that fills the screen. rene grabs it from him. he holds it up for everyone to see.}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{isn't he great? thanks, jean.}
<A>__{he rips the page from the book.}
<C>__{rene }
<D>__{he owes me one.}
<A>__{everyone's face drops. mr. chow grabs his book. he motions to a couple waiters }
<C>__{mr. chow}
<D>__{you're too much, rene. get this guy out of here.}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{i haven't eaten yet!!!}
<A>__{the waiters grab rene's arms.}
<C>__{rene }
<D>__{hands off me, you faggots! i'm going. i'm going...i've kept diana vreeland waiting too long, anyway.}
<C>__{andy warhol}
<D>__{wow... that was a nice drawing, too, jean. maybe you should do another one.}
<C>__{mr. chow}
<P>__{(exhausted)}
<D>__{some other time.}
<A>__{spontaneously, david mcdermott climbs onto the tabletop downstairs and sings "paris je t'aime." as he belts it out in a theatrical falsetto, he glides over glasses and plates, executing a leap to another table in mid song. the restaurant staff and other dinner guests watch, agape. close up david's shoes. as david dances, annina walks over to the table, greeting people and saying goodnight.}
<C>__{annina nosei}
<P>__{(to jean)}
<D>__{it's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, i will handle it for you. everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{annina leaves. jean leans back in his chair, taking in this splendid new world. he pulls out a joint, lights up, inhales with pleasure, closes his eyes and smiles. super over his face: "four years later"}
