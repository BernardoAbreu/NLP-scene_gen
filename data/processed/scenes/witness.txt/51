<L>__{exterior parking lot philadelphia night}
<A>__{book slams the front door of his car, checks it for being locked, glances at a roiled newspaper in his hand (the sports section of the inquirer), starts across the parking lot toward his apartment, walking as he keeps glancing down at the sports section. he comes to a sort of crosswalk, stops, reads, starts to take a step... and looks up.}
<B>__{what he sees}
<A>__{mcelroy, smiling nicely, starting across toward him from the other side of the parking lot crosswalk}
<B>__{back to book}
<A>__{freezing, eyes widening. utterly surprised and caught.}
<B>__{mcelroy}
<A>__{still smiling, he brings up his right hand out of a shopping bag (which he appeared to be carrying) letting the shopping bag fall away as he does so revealing a five inch barrel smith and wesson .357 blue finish revolver with a silencer. without hesitating, coming right on, still smiling, he fires once.}
<B>__{book}
<A>__{already starting to leap away to one side, he is hit, driven into a half turn. he clutches at the wound, as:}
<B>__{mcelroy}
<A>__{coming right on, firing again... the pistol's report a whooshing, like the opening of a bottle of cheap champagne. and mcelroy still smiling as:}
<B>__{book}
<A>__{hit... a grazing near miss this time, but enough to send book down hard and grasping.}
<B>__{mcelroy}
<A>__{lowering the pistol alongside his leg, as two men, barely taking notice of anything, cross with their backs to book toward mcelroy. he smiles at them.}
<B>__{book}
<A>__{down, muttering curses.}
<B>__{the scene}
<A>__{as mcelroy walks past book, drops the pistol to the pavement, keeps on going... and is gone.}
<B>__{book}
<A>__{groaning in pain, beginning to try to crawl crab like. and we hear from the agonized recesses of book's dream.}
<C>__{schaeffer }
<D>__{who else knows?}
<C>__{book }
<D>__{just us.}
<A>__{as the lights of an oncoming car going very slowly, on its way to a parking space sweep over him and we hear it come to a sudden, squealing stop. book is already trying to get to his feet... now succeeds, lurching into a swaying stance, using an adjacent car for support. off screen we hear a car door slam, and footsteps hurrying in our direction, accompanied by excited voices. book hears, turns to face the oncomers,}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{a fat, middle aged man has approached to within some feet of book, looks on edgily:}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hey, buddy, what's the score? little too much to drink?}
<A>__{book stares at him, then looks down at his belly. book's wound as book removes his hand we can see one of the bullets struck him low in the side, just below the ribcage... the other just above it (but this one inflicting only minor damage).}
<B>__{the scene}
<A>__{as the man stares:}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{goddamn, buddy. you better get to a hospital!}
<P>__{(and)}
<D>__{here; i will give you a hand.}
<A>__{he starts to approach, but book shoves him away.}
<C>__{book}
<D>__{no! no hospital!}
<A>__{by now the man's wife is hovering at a safe distance:}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{let him alone, henry! if he wants to die in the street, that's his business!}
<A>__{but the man is not content:}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{shut up, romona! will ya look at that blood?}
<A>__{book has tried to lurch toward his car; the man tries to intercept him:}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{come on, buddy... you're gonna bleed to death!}
<A>__{book whirls on him, his service revolver in his hand pointed squarely at the fat man's face:}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{shit!}
<C>__{wife}
<P>__{(quavering)}
<D>__{i told you, henry!}
<A>__{book doesn't trust himself to speak, but the .38 is sufficiently eloquent for the circumstances, he stares at the fat man another beat, then hesitates, turns, starts back toward his car.}
