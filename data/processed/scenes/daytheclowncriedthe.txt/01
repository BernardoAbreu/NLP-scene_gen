<L>__{exterior paris circus night}
<A>__{the normal activity and excitement of showtime around the circus is in evidence where we see the half dark street and alley directly adjacent to the circus tent which (in paris is an enclosure)... the animals, the midgets, the people and the roustabouts moving with a fixed speed and getting faster as we now know showtime is momentarily due. we move toward the action, slowly but definitely picking up sounds and actions of the busy people as we go.}
