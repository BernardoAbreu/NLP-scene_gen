<D>__{maybe that last school will come through.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{yeah, or maybe he'll get a contract in the mail asking him to be a singing star on t.v.}
<P>__{(on caroline's look)}
<D>__{well, he's got about as much chance of one as of the other.}
<A>__{toby gets up and leaves.}
<L>__{exterior concrete same night}
<A>__{a beauty shop with a tired sign... "arlene's golden comb beauty salon," a beer joint, a pool hall, a woman's clothing store with headless mannequins. toby surveys the scene, with an expression of despair. toby catches his reflection in a store window. he stares at himself.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{a concrete boy.}
