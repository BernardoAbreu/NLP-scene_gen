<L>__{interior jake and jane's hotel room upstairs same time}
<A>__{the curtains are drawn, the lights are low. jane, in a hotel robe, slips a cd in the cd player and we hear a mellow song, perfect for love in the afternoon. the bathroom door opens and jake exits, also in a hotel robe. jane stands across the room from him. they smile at one another. from behind, we see jane untie her robe, letting it fall to the floor. jake looks at her, from head to toe and back. they smile at one another, then something comes over jake. his eyes roll back, his legs give out and he collapses against the wall.}
