<L>__{interior lounge}
<A>__{jack and frank slide quickly behind their pianos. about half the tables in the room are filled.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{good evening, ladies and gentlemen. welcome to the ambassador lounge. my name's frank baker and no, you're not seeing double, it's just my little brother, jack.}
<A>__{some laughter.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm glad you're all in such a good mood tonight, because we've got a very special evening planned ...}
<L>__{interior kitchen}
<A>__{susie sits on a stool while carlos positions the dress tags on a cutting board. as a waitress from the bar passes by, susie snares a drink from her tray.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{just a sip. to kill the butterflies, okay?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{okay. but no lipstick.}
<A>__{susie takes a quick sip.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{there. no one's the wiser.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{nice dress.}
<A>__{as the waitress exits, carlos brings the cleaver down with a sharp chop, severing the tags.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{appreciate it, ace.}
<B>__{lounge}
<A>__{the audience is laughing.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{but seriously, folks, as i sit here tonight, looking out on all your kind faces, i can't help but feel some of us have met before. we may not know each other's names, we might not recognize one another on the street, but we know each other just the same. and over the years we've shared something. a little music, a little drink, a little laughter, maybe even... a few tears. but i guess that's what friends are for, huh?}
<A>__{applause. jack puts out his cigarette.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, brother.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{and it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and i. this evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady jack and i are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all. she's making her debut here this evening and, as far as i'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the ambassador lounge. ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, miss susie diamond.}
<A>__{applause. susie strides out of the kitchen, past the busing station, and up to the microphone stand, which, unfortunately, is not on.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing; whispering)}
<D>__{the switch. hit the switch.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{switch?}
<P>__{(as she hits it)}
<D>__{what fucking switch?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing; very demure)}
<D>__{pardon me.}
<A>__{jack and frank look at one another, then, before outrage can set in, plunge into the opening number. susie takes the mike from the stand and smiles sweetly.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i can't tell you how thrilled i am to be here.}
<A>__{for the moment, the audience doesn't seem quite sure how thrilled they are to be here.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm all smiles, darling through and through...'}
