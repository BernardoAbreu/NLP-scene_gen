<L>__{interior dining room day}
<A>__{diane’s voice is heard over two shaking hands trying not to spill a pot of coffee as it fills a cup.}
<D>__{diane’s voice none of us have been much fun to be around. i guess you can tell i haven’t slept very much. steve’s stayed home from work so much. he’s been really wonderful. really.}
<A>__{pan up from the shaking hands to dr. martha lesh. she must now use both hands, steady the coffee she’s just poured. her assistants are in no better condition. angle diane she looks terrific. her eyes are alert, hair combed back and held with a bright yellow clip. she sips her coffee with rock steady hands and softly inquires.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{how long have you been investigating haunted houses?}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<P>__{(embarrassed, backtracking)}
<D>__{well, mrs. freeling...}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{diane.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{the determination as to whether your home is haunted is not a very easy one.}
<A>__{at that moment the coffee pot moves by itself to the table’s edge but doesn’t spill. dr. lesh tries to overlook this, for appearances sake.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{what i meant to say was this could very well be a poltergeist intrusion instead of the classic haunting.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{there’s a difference?}
<A>__{two bright flashes of light distract lesh and her associates.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{anybody see that?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{there’ll be two more in a few seconds. they always travel in pairs.}
<A>__{tak sits holding the camera with his mouth hung open. lesh nudges him.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{dr. casey!}
<A>__{tak snaps out of it and looks down to adjust the lens setting just as two more flashes go off in the air.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{gotta be quicker than that around here.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{it’s electrical... you can smell the charge.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{you were saying poltergeists...}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<P>__{(rattled)}
<D>__{i was saying they are generally associated with an individual.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{in the general vernacular, hauntings seems to be connected with an area... a house usually.}
<C>__{tak}
<D>__{poltergeist disturbances are of fairly short duration. perhaps a couple of months. hauntings can go on for years.}
<A>__{diane takes steve’s hand, suddenly frightened.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{are you telling me all this could just end at any time?}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{unless it’s a haunting. but as a rule, there seems to be no living person around whom haunting incidents revolve.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{then we don’t have much time, dr. lesh. because my daughter is alive somewhere in this house.}
