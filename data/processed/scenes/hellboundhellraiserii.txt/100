<L>__{interior corridors labyrinth}
<A>__{kirsty and tiffany are walking warily along a corridor when, suddenly, the corridor wall parts with a roar. both girls jump, and tiffany cries out. a new, and very narrow corridor has been revealed. the girls stare down it. it culminates in a door. despite being set in a blank gray stone wall, the door is normal. but frightening because it is an exact replica of the front door of 55 lodovico street, larry's house. before kirsty can react to this, a voice issues from beyond the door.}

<D>__{daddy...?}
<A>__{only a low moan comes from behind the door.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{tiffany. wait here. if i'm not back real soon get out. get home.}
