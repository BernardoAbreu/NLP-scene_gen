<A>__{father homeijer slowly descends the rickety basement steps. at the bottom, he finds a string that connects to a bare overhead bulb... he creeps along the dusty cement floor, past an old washer dryer, continuing toward the source of the crying, which has become more pronounced. he wrinkles his nose at a foul smell...}

<D>__{who's there?}
<A>__{he rounds a corner, and when he sees billy moorcroft he's nearly frozen in shock the boy is locked inside a large, metal dog's cage. he sits on the floor of the cage, rocking back and forth. he is pale, bruised and slick with sweat, clothed only in a pair of soiled briefs. beside him is an aluminum water bowl and some scraps of white bread. the floor beneath him is soaked with urine and scattered feces. father homeijer makes the sign of the cross.}
