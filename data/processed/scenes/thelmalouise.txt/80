<L>__{interior police station day}
<A>__{hal goes over a list of every registered green t bird in the state. insert computer monitor names are scrolling by as hal stares blankly at the screen. we see the name louise elizabeth sawyer scroll past. it means nothing to hal.}
<L>__{interior car day}
<A>__{it's twenty minutes later. they are clear of the town. thelma is like a dog with a bone. she just won't let it drop.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride. did you see his butt? darryl doesn't have a cute butt. you could park a car in the shadow of his ass.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm just not in the mood for company right now. here. take this map. i need you to find all the secondary roads to mexico from oklahoma city. i think we should stay off the interstates. we're too conspicuous.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(taking map)}
<D>__{well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards dallas, then cut over to...}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i don't want to go that way. find a way that we don't have to go through texas.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(looking at map)}
<D>__{wait. what? you want to go to mexico from oklahoma and you don't want to go through texas?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{you know how i feel about texas... we're not going that way.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i know, louise, but we're running for our lives! don't you think you could make an exception just this once?! i mean, look at the map. the only thing between oklahoma and mexico is texas!}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{thelma! i'm not gonna talk about this! now find another way or give me the goddamn map and i will! you understand?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{no, louise. how come you never said what happened?}
<A>__{louise is completely unreasonable on this subject and thelma is totally puzzled by louise's reaction but is reluctant to press her further.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i... i just... i just don't think it's the place i wanna get caught for doin' something like... if you blow a guy's head off with his pants down, believe me, texas is the last place you wanna get caught! trust me! now, i said, i don't wanna talk about it!!}
<A>__{louise looks very shaken up. she keeps her eyes on the road but she's holding the steering wheel so tightly, her knuckles are white. she does not look at thelma. suddenly she reaches over and locks her door. thelma flinches imperceptibly at this gesture.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{okay. we'll go around texas to get to mexico. this is crazy.}
