<A>__{this is ten years ago. rheya enters, alone. she crosses to the kitchen and makes a drink. almost immediately, the labrador puppy enters from the bedroom and stands beside her, tail wagging. she ignores it and continues mixing her drink. halfway through this activity, the bedroom light comes on. a moment later, kelvin is in the doorway. eventually, but not angrily, because he's still not really awake:}
<C>__{kelvin}
<D>__{where've you been?}
<C>__{rheya}
<D>__{i been thinking about how much i hate you.}
<A>__{she finishes making her drink, drinks it, and walks out the door. kelvin stands in the doorway for a beat, then pivots and returns to bed. the light goes out.}
<C>__{rheya }
<D>__{yes, i remember that. i went back to lois' house and spent the night. those were dark days.}
