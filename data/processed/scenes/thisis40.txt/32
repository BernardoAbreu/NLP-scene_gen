<C>__{pete}
<D>__{that's why we have to keep her.}

<C>__{debbie }
<D>__{is she screwing him??}

<D>__{that might be like a dry hump.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{look at the position of her skirt.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{that's too grainy to know for sure. oh my god, this is the middle of the day. customers could be in there.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{at least she's getting some.}
