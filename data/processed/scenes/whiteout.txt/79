<L>__{interior cargo bay right after}
<A>__{trailing her beam of light, carrie and delfy climb through a thick wall of nylon webbing. enter a cluttered cargo area. ransacked antarctic gear is strewn everywhere in a tangle of ropes and crampons, old ecw gear, and boxes of supplies. dipping into a case of bottles, delfy pulls one free, sniffs, and drinks.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{delfy grins.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{vodka.}
<A>__{carrie continues through the hold. her flashlight beam flickers over more chaos of the crash. huge steel tanks take up most of the mid section. spots pryce's flashlight holding on something just ahead. moves to it.}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(suspicious)}
<D>__{find what you're looking for?}
<A>__{her light hits pryce, who is focused on a heavy steel cage welded into the airframe. incredibly strong. and inside it is a steel safe. door is open. pryce takes a beat turns to she and delfy.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{just answers.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{those are fuel tanks behind you. this plane was outfitted for long range capabilities.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{and by the looks of that safe, must've been transporting something pretty important.}
<A>__{carrie moves in closer. sees that the cage has been breached. part of it has been damaged by the crash and this weakness has been ruthlessly attacked by the previous intruders until they forced an opening. discarded tools litter the floor.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{they put some serious work into this.}
<A>__{there's a pool of frozen blood near the opening where one of the torn, jagged bars of the steel cage is covered in blood }
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{whoever got hurt, they dragged him out of here. there's blood all over the tunnel.}
<A>__{she uses her light to examine the interior of the safe more closely the frost on the shelves exposes six round rust rings where containers have been removed. each one roughly measuring a foot tall, four inches wide. the plane suddenly trembles.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{the muffled roar of a diesel.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{it's the cat!}
<A>__{crash! the unmistakable sound of falling ice.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{crashcrashcrash! more ice. they scramble back through the darkness, the flashlight beams swinging wildly about the hold. more ice falls. it's getting louder as they're getting closer to the source. carrie targets ahead with her light illuminates the hatch as a load of ice drops in covering it completely. light fades.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{sonofabitch!}
<A>__{the continual sound of falling ice grows muffled and}
<B>__{distant.}
<A>__{carrie and pryce both pull out their phones.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{no signal, you?}
<A>__{shakes his head no.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{someone followed us.}
