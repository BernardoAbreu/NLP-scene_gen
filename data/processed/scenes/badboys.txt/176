<A>__{lowrey climbs under blanket on sofa, the back of which faces the window. exhausted, he turns off light and closes his eyes. a beat. burnett's face pops up furtively in window, his nose pressed against the glass, looking for evidence of adultery. he can't see lowrey asleep on the couch. his head drops below the window frame, only to reappear in another window. seeing nothing, he moves on.}
