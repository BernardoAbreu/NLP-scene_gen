<L>__{interior enterprise various areas}
<A>__{kirk and wet scotty race through the ship only to finally turn a corner and be faced with phasers, aimed right at them. but suddenly phasers are at their heads. two security guards one, the guy he got into the fight with at the bar, years ago.}
<D>__{security officer #1 come with me. moon beam.}
<A>__{off kirk shit }
<L>__{interior enterprise bridge [set change]}
<A>__{woosh bridge doors open kirk and scotty are ushered in by the security guards. spock moves to them, containing his anger and dismay. mccoy is here as well. spock walks right up to kirk... raises his eyebrow.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{surprise.}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(to scotty)}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{he's with me.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{we're travelling at warp how did you manage to get aboard this ship?}
<A>__{kirk stares at the young spock a different experience now }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you're the genius, you figure it out.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{as captain of this vessel i order you to answer the question.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{well i'm not telling.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{captain.}
<A>__{huh. that confounds spock. and kirk is off to the races }
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{does that frustrate you? my lack of cooperation... does it make you angry?}
<A>__{spock again focuses on scotty }
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{you are not a member of this ship's crew. under penalty of court martial, i order you to explain to me how you beamed ab }
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(to scotty)}
<D>__{ don't answer him.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{you will answer me.}
<A>__{on scotty. weighing all this. then }
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{i'd rather not take sides.}
<A>__{spock nods back to the security guards, over this }
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{escort them to the brig.}
<A>__{but before the guards can do so }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what is it about you, spock? your planet was just destroyed your mother murdered and you're not even upset?}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{your presumption that these experiences interfere with my abilities to command this ship is inaccurate }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{ha! and yet you said fear was necessary for command. i mean did you see that bastard's ship? did you see what he did?}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(tense)}
<D>__{yes, of course i }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{so are you afraid or aren't you?!?}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(tenser)}
<D>__{i will not... allow you to lecture me about the merits of emotion.}
<A>__{kirk gets close to spock }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{then why don't you stop me.}
<A>__{sarek watches, tense. mccoy, too. spock blinks }
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{step away from me, mr. kirk.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what is it like? not to feel? anger. or heartbreak. or the need to stop at nothing to avenge the death of the woman who gave birth to you?!}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(volcanic)}
<D>__{ back away }
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(closer still)}
<D>__{you must not feel anything! it must not even compute for you! you must not have loved her at all !}
<A>__{ wham! spock has just hit kirk and kirk goes to hit back, but spock fucking delivers a series of powerful blows security stand back as the captain attacks... and spock is now fucking choking kirk he slams kirk against the wall spock's choking the life out of him }
<C>__{sarek}
<D>__{spock!}
<A>__{and everything everything stops. spock, red faced, releases his grip. kirk gulps air and tumbles to the ground. spock staggers back. kirk's hardly able to speak, close to collapsing. but despite his brutalized face, his expression isn't about spite, or hatred... but compassion. spock sees the faces of the stunned crew staring at him. but worst of all? sarek. his father. spock levels his chin. quickly wipes his eyes. trying to regain some semblance of dignity... looks to mccoy. softly }
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{doctor. i am no longer fit for duty. i hereby relinquish my command on the grounds that i have been... emotionally compromised. please note the time and date in the ship's log.}
<A>__{jesus. spock just... quit. and after a beat, he leaves the room. sarek follows a moment later. the crew just stands there in stunned silence. finally }
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{i like this ship. it's exciting.}
<A>__{mccoy turns to kirk, exasperated }
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{congratulations, jim. now we've got no captain and no first officer to goddamn replace him.}
<A>__{on kirk. the moment is upon him.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{yeah we do.}
<A>__{on mccoy. the crew confused. sulu just fucking points at kirk and they all realize holy shit pike made kirk the first officer before he left!}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{thanks for the support!}
<A>__{and kirk moves to the captain's chair, passing uhura:}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{i sure hope you know what you're doing.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{... so do i.}
