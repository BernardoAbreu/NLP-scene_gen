<A>__{nicky takes off the shirt. michael struggles out of his t shirt and we see that he is wearing the elastic bandage he thought he had lost. he is sitting with his head tilted up, eyes closed, and is unaware that he is wearing the bandage. nicky takes the new bandage, winds it tightly and puts it back in the box. his father has gone to sleep.}
