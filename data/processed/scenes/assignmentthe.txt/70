<L>__{interior kitchen set prison day}
<A>__{in the middle of a huge room, a movie set has been erected. there are flats supported by sand bags which form the "set" of a kitchen. the set is perfect in every way but its position inside of a huge prison hall lends a quality of the macabre, since no movie is being shot here and no audience will ever see these performances. jack is there with ramirez. he opens the refrigerator and ramirez looks inside as jack times him on his watch, then closes the refrigerator. ramirez sneezes. he has caught a cold but must ignore it.}

<D>__{top shelf... some milk, some juice, maybe some cottage cheese, a couple bottles of beer, some tomatoes... i don't know...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what kind of milk, how many cartons, open or closed, what kind of juice, how full was the bottle, was it cottage cheese or cream cheese, how many bottles of beer, how many tomatoes? this is life and death!}
