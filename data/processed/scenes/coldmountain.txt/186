<L>__{exterior tree tunnel near cherokee village. morning}
<A>__{ada collects the two turkeys, the first creatures she's ever shot. doesn't quite know how to hold them. she straightens up and sees, at the other end of the tree tunnel, backlit by the morning sun, the silhouette of a man. she drops the turkeys tires to reload the shotgun. inman comes down the tunnel, approaching the hunter he sees through the snow at the other end of it.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{turn round and go back where you came from.}
<A>__{inman is bewildered by this woman's voice in a man's outfit, keeps walking, peering through the snow. ada fires a warning shot. inman, still some distance, suddenly understands.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{ada? ada monroe?}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i do not know you.}
<A>__{after all this time, all this way, inman could give up the ghost.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{then i believe i made a mistake.}
<A>__{he turns, walks heavily away from her. then he turns again, completely lost, without compass.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{if i knew where to go i'd go there.}
<C>__{ada}
<P>__{(finally recognising him)}
<D>__{inman?}
<A>__{he nods. they don't know how to speak to each other, just stand awkwardly, some distance apart, the emotion stones in their throats. eventually }
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{you'd better come with me.}
<A>__{and with that, she starts to sob, and sob. very high angle: inman walks towards ada. they embrace.}
