<A>__{wearing pyjamas, dressing gown and slippers, mandela multi tasks, watching boland botha and going through a pile of correspondence, scribbling notes or signing his name.}
<C>__{boland botha }
<D>__{they brought shame upon our nation, and i, for one, can say without fear of contradiction, that today, these fifteen so called men did not deserve to wear the hallowed green and gold.}
<A>__{on mandela: a thought, an idea a big one is churning in his head. he grunts, turns off the tv, puts the correspondence aside, stands. mary enters with a glass of milk and some pills, on a tray.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{here's your muti. i warmed the milk tonight.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{you're too good to me.}

<D>__{she said to tell you she was sorry.}
<A>__{mandela nods, has a hard time swallowing his last pill.}

<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{no, thank you. i'm going to bed. good night.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{good night, madiba. sleep well.}
<A>__{mandela smiles at her, but as soon as he is past her, the smile fades. as he climbs the stairs to his bedroom, his face becomes sadder and older and lonelier. in his bedroom, mandela pauses to take off his dressing gown. he looks at his bed. it is as smooth and as blank as a sheet of paper. he peels back the bedclothes at one corner, slides under them and pauses for a moment while reaching for the light switch. he switches off the light and lies down, still and straight. the most popular man in the world starts and ends each day alone.}
