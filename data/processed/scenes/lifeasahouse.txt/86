<A>__{in the late june afternoon, with a clotted cloud sky, robin, adam, ryan, sam, alyssa and george work at building a house. adam and ryan are staining the interior doors they stripped days earlier. george and sam carry large wood beam to the foundation and slip it into the pocket mortise of the laminated beam that spans from pier post to pier post. robin grabs a drill and screws the cast in tie down to the wood beam. alyssa is sawing a rafter in half as her mother walks across the grass with a huge basket of food.}
