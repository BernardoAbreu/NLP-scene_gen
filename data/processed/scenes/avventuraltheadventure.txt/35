<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{it is evening. sandro's car is pulling into the town of taormina on its way to the san domenico. it comes to a small square and passes by a group of men and women seated on the steps of an ancient ruin. they are dressed in evening clothes and are laughing and giggling. the car turns into the street of the san domenico and stops in front of the hotel. a porter immediately comes out and opens the door. claudia and sandro get out and head towards the small courtyard that leads into the foyer. the lobby is full of activity and alive with people dressed in formal attire. claudia is clearly intrigued by everything she sees: the surroundings, the people, etc. sandro approaches the reception desk as claudia walks slightly ahead, anxious to see what is going on. the sound of music is heard coming from one of the halls at the other end of the lobby. there is obviously a party underway: further on, through a glass partition, couples are seen dancing. suddenly, claudia stops. directly up ahead, she notices patrizia. as soon as she see claudia, patrizia comes to greet her, smiling.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{well, i'm looking for somebody else and who do i find but you.}
<A>__{claudia smiles and they both kiss each other on the cheek.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{how are you?}
<A>__{instead of answering, patrizia takes claudia by the hand and leads her over to a bench along the side of the wall and sits down. claudia remains standing, somewhat annoyed by the crowd of people around her.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{quieter? oh, yes, of course.}
<A>__{patrizia rises and leads claudia out to a terrace that overlooks the entire bay which is dotted with lights. claudia takes in the view but her attention is still focused on patrizia. she waits from one moment to the next to have questions thrown at her, but patrizia remains silent. so claudia turns around and looks at her as though to say: come on, say what you have to say and let's get it over with. but patrizia smiles at her sweetly and only murmurs:}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{you look so wonderfully tanned.}
<A>__{claudia feels relieved and presses patrizia's hand, almost with a sense of renewed friendship. sandro appears from behind the glass partition and comes out on the terrace to greet patrizia.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{and here's sandro.}
<P>__{(he kisses her hand)}
<D>__{why don't you two go upstairs and change?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{yes, we will.}
<A>__{they leave the terrace and go through one of the halls towards the corridor that leads to the rooms. claudia walks ahead, with patrizia and sandro following slightly behind. the hall is still packed with people.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{did you manage to find good rooms?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{they didn't seem too good.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{you should have told ettore. he always manages to get what he wants.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{ettore must be fed up with me by now.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{oh, no, not at all. and then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...}
<A>__{claudia looks at sandro, assured by patrizia's reply. she remains thoughtful for a moment, then asks patrizia:}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{how do you manage to put up with all this confusion? you always said people bore you.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{you shouldn't always take me seriously. actually, i'm used to it by now. first my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{your mother?}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{yes, even i had a mother. she was part austrian, but she was still my mother. my childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{my childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{what do you mean by sensible?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{it means being without money.}
<A>__{patrizia and sandro burst out laughing, and sandro reaches out and ruffles claudia's hair. they have arrived in front of a room that is situated on the ground floor, and are greeted by a hotel clerk who is waiting for them with keys in hand. the door is already open and claudia is about to enter.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{see you soon, then.}
<A>__{sandro nods yes and claudia waves so long, as patrizia takes her leave. claudia enters the room behind the clerk, and sandro follows. claudia stops in the middle of the room, as the clerk goes through his various duties with professional exactitude: he turns on the lights, draws the window curtains, checks to see if there are enough hangers in the wardrobe, then finally opens the door to the adjoining room, into which he disappears. all his movements seem completely automatic.}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(commenting under his breath)}
<D>__{you see? just like a robot.}
<A>__{then sandro enters the adjoining room, where the clerk has in the meantime turned on all the lamps and performed all the other little duties. sandro starts to undo his tie. claudia remains standing in the middle of the room, listening to all of sandro's movements in the other room. a knock is heard at the door of sandro's room and sandro is heard saying:}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{a few seconds later, the porter also enters claudia's room with her baggage. she opens the valise and starts taking out her nightgown and other necessities. her gestures are slow and imprecise because fatigue has overcome her. several moments pass, and sandro appears at the door in his pajamas.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{sandro, listen... try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{aren't you going to change?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you said you wanted to quit working for ettore.}
<A>__{sandro shrugs his shoulders without, apparently, giving much thought to claudia's statement. he goes into the bathroom saying:}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{sure, that's what i said...}
<A>__{the sound of the shower running is heard.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{wow, it's ice cold...}
<A>__{claudia goes up to the door adjoining the two rooms and stops at the doorway of the bathroom that is situated between the two rooms.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{sandro, i'm not coming down.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'm too sleepy.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{sleep is something one must learn to overcome. i learned how to do it when i was a child. i never slept. and i had friends who even slept less than i did. the one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. and we really didn't do anything. after seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...}
<A>__{claudia has been listening to sandro with her head leaning against the door jamb, her eyes closed. as soon as sandro stops, she goes back to her bed and starts undressing. sandro comes out of the bathroom, wearing a bathrobe, and going over to claudia, says in an affectionate tone:}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{you're that sleepy, eh? what time do expect to get up tomorrow?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{late, very late.}
<A>__{claudia disappears into her bathroom, and sandro returns to his room. after a while, his voice is heard.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{did you know that when i was a boy i wanted to be a diplomat? can you imagine that! me, a diplomat? it's strange but i never thought i'd be rich. i saw myself living in a rooming house, full of geniuses...}
<A>__{claudia has slipped into her nightgown and returned to her room. sandro is heard clearing his throat, and then continuing.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{instead, i have two apartments, one in rome and one in milan. as far as genius goes, it's a habit i've never formed. what do you think of that?}
<A>__{sandro reappears at the doorway, already half dressed. claudia slides into bed and stretches herself out under the covers.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i look at things differently... but maybe it's best we talk about it some other time. do you mind turning off that light over there?}
<A>__{sandro turns out the lamp on the table while claudia closes the main switch. the room is enveloped in darkness. sandro approaches the bed and bends over claudia to kiss her.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{good night, my love.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{good night. tell me that you love me.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{tell me once more.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i don't love you.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i deserve it.}
<A>__{sandro goes towards the door, then turns and smiles.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{that's not true. i love you.}
<A>__{he returns to his room, closing the door behind him. he seems somewhat meditative, as though the little discourse he has just delivered has in some way touched him deeply. he also seems a little sad. then he puts on his tie and jacket, lights up a cigarette, and goes to the door.}
