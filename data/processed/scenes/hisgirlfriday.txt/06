<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(shaking his head as he writes it down)}
<D>__{milk.}
<C>__{burns}

<D>__{taking the train today and being married tomorrow?}
<A>__{he whistles.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(rising to the bait)}
<D>__{oh, it isn't like that.}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(reassuring mrs. grundy)}
<D>__{it will be perfectly all right, walter. mother is coming with us on the train.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{mother? but your mother }
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{no. my mother.}
<C>__{burns}
<P>__{(he gets it and underlines it)}
<D>__{oh. your mother well, of course, that relieves my mind.}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(to bruce)}
<D>__{isn't it sweet of walter still wanting to protect me?}
<A>__{she gives burns that too sweet look.}
<C>__{burns}
<P>__{(apparently taking this at face value)}
<D>__{i know i wasn't a good husband, hildy, but you can always count on me.}
<A>__{two shot featuring bruce and hildy}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(a little cookily)}
<D>__{i don't think she'll need you very much i aim to do most of the protecting myself.}
<A>__{he pats hildy's arm she smiles at him. three shot hildy, bruce and burns}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{well, i will tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{i might have, walter, but you were never there.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{anyway, i'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things i couldn't give her. you know, hildy is about the best reporter in the country and that goes regardless of sex. but all she really ever wanted was a home.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{well, i will try to give her one.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{i know you will, bruce. are you going to live with your mother?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{just for the first year.}
<C>__{burns}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{that'll be nice. a home with mother. a real honeymoon. in albany, too. ow!}
<A>__{that "ow" is sotto voce, but it's the direct result of a kick under the table from hildy.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{mighty nice little town, albany. they've got the state capitol there, you know.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{yes, i know...}
<P>__{(he chuckles)}
<D>__{hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? she didn't even know i was in town...}
<A>__{his laugh stops cold and he clutches for his shin again. hildy just looks. providentially, the waiter enters the scene.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{well, here we are.}
<A>__{he begins serving them.}
<C>__{burns}
<P>__{(trying to pick up again after a second)}
<D>__{how's business, bruce?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{well, albany's a mighty good insurance town. most people there take it out pretty early in life.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{i don't blame them.}
<A>__{gus, who has just managed to come between hildy and burns, lets out a startled "ouch".}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry, gus! my foot must have slipped.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(a pained expression belies his words)}
<D>__{that's all right.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{i sometimes wish i'd taken out insurance but, of course, now it doesn't matter. still, i suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{well, i honestly feel that way. i figure i'm in one line of business that really helps people. of course, we don't help you much when you're alive but afterward that's what counts.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{i see what you mean.}
<A>__{they fall to. close shot hildy she sips her coffee and acts surprised.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{gus, this }
<A>__{closeup gus}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(winking)}
<D>__{good coffee, isn't it?}
<A>__{closeup hildy she smiles and winks back, and takes another sip.}
<B>__{group shot at table}
<A>__{gus starts to go.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{you've forgotten my milk.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{oh. the milk. yes.}
<A>__{he leaves scene, shaking his head. burns sips his coffee. he likes it. he lifts his cup to hildy.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(lifts cup)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(looking for something}
<D>__{to respond with }
<P>__{apologetically)}
<D>__{he hasn't brought my milk yet.}
<A>__{a bus boy comes into scene and stops before burns.}
<C>__{bus boy}
<D>__{they want you on the phone, mr. burns.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{they would!}
<A>__{boy goes, burns rises, starts off, comes back for his cup of coffee, which he then takes off with him. two shot bruce and hildy}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(looking after him)}
<D>__{you know, hildy, he's not a bad fellow.}
<C>__{hildy}
<P>__{(looking at him maternally)}
<D>__{you're so nice, bruce, you think everybody else is.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{oh, he's not the man for you. i can see that. but i sort of like him. got a lot of charm.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{he comes by it naturally. his grandfather was a snake.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{if anybody had told me i'd be sitting at lunch with him but he swept me right off my feet.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{that's what he did to me. swept me right off my feet and left me lying on the floor.}
