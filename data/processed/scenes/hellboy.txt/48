<L>__{interior b.p.r.d. concrete chamber 51 dusk}
<A>__{the elevator stops in a narrow, dark space. neon lights flicker on, illuminating a circular chamber. painted on the floor is a huge number: 51. right in front of myers: a magnificent oak door. myers knocks on it. no answer. myers enters.}
<L>__{interior broom s office (full aquarium) dusk}
<A>__{myers looks around, fascinated: books. an office made of them. the soft glow of green shaded reading lamps bathes everything in an intimate, warm light. one entire wall is a thick pane of glass, the wall of a huge tank of water. a voice crackles through an intercom next to the tank.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{turn the pages, please.}
<A>__{myers jumps, then moves closer to the glass.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{over here... if you don't mind?}
<A>__{in the tank, abe sapien, a fish man glides in and out view.}
<C>__{myers}
<D>__{jesus christ!}
<A>__{myers looks at four book stands facing the glass. each supports an open volume. he leans close to the glass, peering intently. abe reappears. he is slender, dolphin gray, with dark patterns streaking his soft skin. bright blue eyes shine with intelligence. behind a thin wound like mouth, gills are bubbling.}

<P>__{(points at the books)}
<D>__{these ? you're reading these ?}
<A>__{abe nods. through a side door, broom enters.}

<C>__{abe}
<D>__{agent john t. myers, kansas city, 76. "t" stands for thaddeus, mother's older brother. scar on your chin happened when you were ten, you still wonder if it's ever going to fade away.}

<C>__{broom}
<D>__{as you entered the lobby there was an inscription }
<C>__{myers}
<D>__{on the desk, yes. in latin.}
<C>__{broom}
<D>__{impressive. do you remember what it said?}
<C>__{myers}
