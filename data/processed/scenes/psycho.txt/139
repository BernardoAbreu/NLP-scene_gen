<L>__{exterior street the sheriff lives on (night)}
<A>__{a dark, quiet, tree ceilinged street, the small neat houses dim in the moonlight. sam's pick up truck comes down the street, pulls up before the house of sheriff chambers. camera moves in on sam and lila as they remain for a moment in the truck's cab, staring quietly at the sleeping house.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{our deputy sleeps.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{nothing. just... all the lights out... must be asleep.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(a small exasperation)}
<D>__{does that mean we can't...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no. i'm just procrastinating. people hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.}
<P>__{(gives up, starts out)}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{he gets out of cab, goes around to help lila. she is already out. camera follows them up the small path to the front door. sam presses the bell button. both he and lila are almost knocked over by the shocking, clanging, ear splitting blast of the bell within the house, a ring which sounds more like a fire alarm than a doorbell. he tries to smile, fails. lila doesn't even try. the downstairs hall light goes on and a moment later the door is unhesitatingly opened by mrs. chambers, a small, lively stick of a woman wrapped in a thick flannel robe and a corona of hospitality.}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sorry, mrs. chambers. i hate bothering you...}
<C>__{mrs. chambers}
<D>__{you didn't!}
<P>__{(a cross look up at the bell)}
<D>__{it's tinkerbell.}
<P>__{(a quick smile at lila)}
<D>__{al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{well come on in, at least!}
<A>__{as she opens the door wide,}
