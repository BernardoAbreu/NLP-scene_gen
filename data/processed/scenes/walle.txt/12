<A>__{the morning sun. wall e fully exposed in its light. his front panel splayed out like a tanning shield. a solar collector. his charge meter chimes full. solar panels fold away into hiding. wall e, now awake, collects his lunch cooler. heads off to work. ...and accidentally runs over the cockroach. horrified, wall e reverses. reveals the flattened insect under his tread. the cockroach simply pops back to life. no biggie. ready to go. relieved, wall e resumes their commute.}
