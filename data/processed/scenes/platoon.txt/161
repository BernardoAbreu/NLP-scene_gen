<L>__{exterior perimeter #3 barnes' foxhole day}
<A>__{past scores of nva bodies. past the foxhole where bunny lays dead in the bottom, faceless. looking over at junior bayoneted to the ground, dead. nva everywhere around the hole, some of them still moving, badly wounded. chris looking around, then noticing a movement a little further out in the jungle. then he sees who. the uniform is shredded, the figure obviously hurt in several places (thigh, back, neck, hand) but not mortally so, now struggling to right itself, dragging its face up from a belly down position. streaked with dirt and blood, we see barnes once again re emerging from the dead. chris steps over to him, a solemn look on his face. barnes looks up, begs.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{get me a medic will ya. go on ...}
<A>__{chris doesn't move. barnes looks at him again, reading the intention that has crossed chris' mind. an expression of surprise crosses his face, then amazement, almost shock.}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{fuck you in hell ...}
<A>__{chris shoots him. once. twice. three times. silence ... barnes is finally dead. chris looking at the corpse, numbed, no exultation in his expression. just cold satisfaction and little feeling left. behind him, the sound of a big machine moving. he turns. a huge nazi flag on an antenna looms up in the bush, followed by the great belly of a turreted dragon crunching down a tree for its breakfast. a big tough german shepard comes boudning at him sniffs, followed by a flak jacketed monster man filthy and greasy, unshaven face, earring in his left ear, 'death corps' scrawled on his shirtless flak jacket and a drawing of a death's head, he looks like a cross between a pirate and a hell's angel. behind him, a second monster man and the armored personnel carrier grinding its engine, a human skull hanging from its turret.}
<C>__{monster man}
<P>__{(to dog)}
<D>__{bozo! get back here!}
<A>__{his eyes passing on chris like so much meat.}
<C>__{monster man }
<P>__{(to chris)}
<D>__{can you walk outta here?}
<A>__{chris nods. the soldier pointing to the lz behind him as a sign he should go that way. the other soldier already stripping the nva dead, as the apc grinds on into the jungle, reconnoitering. chris walks out of the jungle, head bowed, nauseated, mixed feelings roiling him.}
