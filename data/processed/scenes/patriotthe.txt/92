<A>__{dark. marion and his battered men gather, taking stock. men drift in, mounted and on foot in ones and twos, past wary sentries. gabriel rides up, dismounts and reports to marion, out of earshot of the other men.}

<C>__{marion}
<D>__{i should have killed him when i had the chance?}

<C>__{marion}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.}
<A>__{marion is silent.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{there will be a time and a place for revenge but killing tarleton at the expense of your duty serves no one but yourself.}

<D>__{stay the course.}
<A>__{the parental sounding formality of gabriel's words brings a thin smile to marion's face.}

<D>__{stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when i'd get drunk or lose my temper.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{she'd say it to me when i picked on thomas or nathan.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you learned her lessons better than i.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{she got me at a more impressionable age.}
<A>__{marion smiles, nods a silent thanks to his son and heads over to help with the wounded.}
