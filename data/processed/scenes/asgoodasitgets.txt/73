<L>__{exterior street near carol's bldg. (moving) day}
<A>__{beverly and carol walking past the store windows. a simple and unprecedented experience in their recent lives.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{nice to get out, isn't it?}
<A>__{carol nods tightly... then they wrap arms around each other and continue walking, turning into a corner bar.}
<L>__{interior carol's restaurant close on carol day}
<A>__{as carol stands nervously while lisa finishes reading her}
<L>__{14 page letter. in the b.g. melvin and frank are seated}
<A>__{at the same table and in earnest conversation. lisa keeps flicking away tears a few drops on the pages.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{don't get it wet.}
<A>__{lisa brushes the paper finishes and embraces carol.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{so it's okay?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you almost have me liking him. you sure come from the heart. i never knew what you went through with everything.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i wanted him to know how much he'd done.}
<P>__{(looking over)}
<D>__{can you believe he's eating with someone.}
<A>__{on melvin & frank}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{it's not my dog and this simon seems to have enough on his mind but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sure take him to the vet.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i did. and his stomach is out of whack. so they need him for a couple of days.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{do it.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{melvin.}
<A>__{she self consciously hands him with the thick envelope.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{a thank you note for what you did for me.}
<A>__{he hands it back to her deliberately. she takes it and walks back to the service area where, embarrassed, confused, and messed with she tosses the note. after carol leaves...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{she's nice.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{really nice. shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it looks like it really went over. you're sure making the rounds. simon says you brought him soup last night. i hope he doesn't write you a note.}
<A>__{melvin looks up wary his brain sends a disturbing message.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{"what?" look at you... you sense a mark.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hey you called me... i...}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{about a dog.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, but it's all about simon now... you helped with the dog... and now there are other things. i'm just as concerned as you are about simon.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{concerned. i'm just the hall monitor here.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's not only financial assistance. what he's got to do is go to baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. it's not going to happen on the phone.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{yeah. if his parents are alive they've got to help those are the rules. good.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yes. and tomorrow? i have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... so i'm out. can you take him?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{think white and get serious.}
<A>__{carol enters scene.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{take my car a convertible. do you drive?}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{like the wind but i'm not doing it.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{getting loud, getting loud.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{he wants me to take his car and his client to baltimore.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so i can get out of this city.}
<A>__{she exits. frank prepares to depart.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{okay. i will take him. get him packed ready tomorrow morning.}
<A>__{frank stumbles back... self satisfied, he relaxes.}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{okay... so i will see you tomorrow. let's not drag this out. we don't enjoy another that much.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{if there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{last word freak.}
<A>__{frank adjusts and exits... carol approaches calling a "good bye" to him.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{so. anything else?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{yes. i'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to baltimore.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{hey, what i did for you is working out?}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(a breath; then)}
<D>__{what you did changed my life.}
<A>__{she offers him the note.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{no... no thank you notes.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{well, part of what i said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... and that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person i've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{lovely.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i also wrote one part... i wrote i'm sorry... i was talking about i was sorry when i got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so i wrote that.}
<P>__{(reading from the}
<D>__{letter, melvin}
<P>__{wildly uncomfortable)}
<D>__{i was sorry for busting you on that... and i'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when i said i was never... i was sorry and i'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...}
<A>__{melvin wants to disappear but carol is getting into it emotionally moved by her own words.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{... and i'm sorry for never spotting, right there at the table in the restaurant, the human being that had it in him to do this thing for us... you know what, i'm just going to start from the beginning... i have not been able to express my gratefulness to you... even as i look at the word "grateful" now it doesn't begin to tell you what i feel for you...}
<A>__{and finally carol notes melvin's mood and pauses.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{nice of you... thank you.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{now i want you to do something for me.}
<A>__{she looks at him for a very strange, long beat.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry... didn't i say, "what?" i thought i said, "what?"... what?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i want you to go on this trip.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{no, sir...}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i can't do this alone. i'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. i need you to chaperon. separate everything but cars. you said you liked convertibles. now i'm on the hook.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{the stiff one eye?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{two days.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i can't. i work.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{you take off when you have to.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{my son.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{bettes tells me he's doing fine.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(no other way)}
<D>__{melvin, i'd rather not.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{what's that got to do with it?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{funny, i thought it was a strong pointerior}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{write me a note and ain't she sweet. i need a hand and where'd she go.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{is there another way to see it?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{no.}
