<T>__{camera on:}
<A>__{i e. ghetto judy's car night judy is driving through the ghetto as jimmy shoots out of the window. on the sidewalk, he catches glimpses drug dealers, a crack whore, a drunk stumbling along, and other pretty sketchy characters.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i love the ghetto. i don't know what it is about it. i fucking love it. it's always the first place i go to when i get out.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i love it when you're out of the looney bin. do you think you might be able to try to avoid the place for a while?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(joking)}
<D>__{if they don't send me to the bin, maybe they'll send me to jail.}
<A>__{this upsets judy.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i'm serious. you act like it's no big deal when you go away!}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(tired of it)}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{no it's not all right! when you're in there i have to be out in the real world alone, by myself jimmy. you go away and come back like it's no big deal. well it is a big deal. i don't want to spend another day without you. do you understand me? i'd rather die.}
<A>__{judy's holding back tears.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i'm not going back.}
<A>__{she doesn't believe him. she's really starting to cry despite herself. he pulls his eye from the lens to look at her.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{judy.}
<A>__{judy looks over at him.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i promise. i swear on my life and i swear on our bond, i will never go back.}
<A>__{her freak out subsides.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{if you swear on our bond, then i believe you.}
<A>__{judy lets out half cry and half yelp. her emotions are a bit out of control.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i love you so fucking much.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i love you too.}
<A>__{awkward silence. judy looks like she wants to ask jimmy something.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i was thinking, the last time you got out we did it like five times, like as soon as we saw each other, we got naked and started doing it. and today, my parents weren't even home and i tried to do some stuff to you, but you were acting like you weren't interested.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i didn't mean to.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{was it because you jerked off so much while you were locked up?}
<A>__{jimmy hands her a small bottle of whiskey. she takes a sizable gulp, makes a face, then hands it back to jimmy.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{judy is getting upset again.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(voice cracking)}
<D>__{then why don't you want to have sex with me jimmy? you don't think i'm pretty anymore?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{no, no, no! that has nothing to do with it. after i saw my dad being rammed in the ass by my mother, i kind of blocked it out, but when i was in there they kept talking to me and talking to me about it. now i can't stop it from coming into my head. every time i get wood, the instant replay machine in my brain projects this image of my mom pounding into my dad.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{god, that's awful. i didn't know.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{yeah well, you know you didn't give too much of an effort to get in my pants anyhow. you just sort of made your sex face and grabbed my crotch.}
<A>__{judy takes another drink off the bottle of whiskey and smiles.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{how do you like this?}
<A>__{while she is driving she pulls down her tank top and quickly exposes her breasts through the top of her shirt.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{now we're talking.}
<A>__{judy tries to position her body so her breasts are in frame. she begins pushing one up, then sticks out her tongue, teasing.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{that is so hot.}
<A>__{judy smiles and looks over at the camera. one hand on the steering wheel and one on her breast, when...}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{watch out!}
<A>__{boom! a loud thump hits the car, shaking the camera.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i think you hit someone.}
<A>__{judy's in shock. jimmy puts the camera on the floor of the car by the passenger seat. he forgets to turn it off. all we see is a close up of the floor and jimmy's feet.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{stay here.}
<A>__{jimmy gets out of the car. we hear the car door open then close. judy sounds like she is having a complete nervous breakdown. she's crying, but in an extremely nervous and frantic way.}
<C>__{judy }
<P>__{(calls to him)}
<D>__{oh my god, what are you doing?}
<A>__{we have no clue what jimmy is doing outside of the car.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{oh fuck, oh fuck. oh my god. jimmy?}
<A>__{we hear a car door open and some struggling sounds coming from jimmy.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{don't put him in here!}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{we're taking him to the hospital.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{no, we'll get busted.}
<A>__{long pause, we hear jimmy struggling off camera.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{what... what are you doing?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{he's not breathing. he's not fucking breathing!}
<A>__{silence. you can feel them thinking.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{is he dead?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(has decided)}
<D>__{pop the trunk for me.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{judy.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{what are we gonna do?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i don't know right now, but we're not driving around with a dead guy in our back seat.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i just want to go home. jimmy, let's leave him. he's dead. we should just go.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{pop the fucking trunk already before someone sees us!}
<A>__{we hear judy pop the trunk. we hear jimmy struggling. the camera is still on the floor of the car. more struggling as jimmy is clearly outside putting the body into the trunk.}
<C>__{judy }
<P>__{(to self)}
<D>__{i want to go home.}
<A>__{we hear jimmy slam the trunk.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(screams; frustrated)}
<D>__{fuck!}
<A>__{we hear jimmy come around to the driver's seat and open the door.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy, i...}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i'm driving.}
<A>__{we hear judy get out of the car and walk around to the passenger side and open the door, but she doesn't get in.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{get in.}
<A>__{judy doesn't respond.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{are you gonna fucking get in!}
<A>__{judy is hysterical.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{we should just leave him here.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{we can't leave him in the middle of the fucking ghetto. get in before someone sees us!}
<A>__{judy's losing it.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i don't want him in my fucking car! i want him out!}
<A>__{before jimmy can respond, we see the reflection of police lights. red and blue lights flicker against the lens.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{oh shit!}
<A>__{we hear judy get in the car and close the door.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{it's the fucking cops.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{just shut up.}
<A>__{she's hysterical.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{it's the cops. it's the cops. it's the...}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{shhhhhh!}
<A>__{jimmy kicks the camera. we still can't see any of this. we can only hear what's happening.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{you gotta play it cool, okay?}
<A>__{judy's crying gets louder.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{stop fucking crying. please, i'm begging you. stop it.}
<A>__{we hear the cop open and shut his patrol car door.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{oh god. he's getting out of the car. we've got a dead homeless guy in our trunk and he's...}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{ssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{oh, my god jimmy, he's walking towards us.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{ssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! just be cool.}
<A>__{the cop is close, we can feel his footsteps coming towards the car. judy collects herself as best as she can. the cop taps his flashlight against the window. we hear judy roll down her power window and we hear the voice of the cop.}
<C>__{cop }
<D>__{good evening. license and registration please.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{certainly, sir.}
<A>__{the light from the cop's flashlight reflects off the floor of the car and into the lens of the camera. the reflections stop. the wait is unbearable.}
<C>__{cop }
<D>__{could you please step out of the vehicle?}
<A>__{jimmy gets out of the car as judy trembles in the passengers seat. we only hear the sounds of judy sniffling and repressing herself from crying and idle chatter of the cop's radio. it seems like forever, then... thump! the car is shaking, we hear intense struggling going on outside. judy unleashes a piercing, high pitched scream.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy!}
<A>__{more violent struggling is heard as judy begins to hyperventilate.}
<B>__{pop}
<A>__{a gunshot is fired. judy screams.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{aaaaahhhhhhh!}
<A>__{pop. another shot is fired. the car door opens, jimmy gets in. we hear the sounds of tires squealing and the engine roaring.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{judy's now totally freaked.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{what happened!}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{just shut the fuck up! i don't fucking want to talk about it!}
<A>__{jimmy can't bully her into silence. she continues to freak out. the camera is kicked.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i just want to know what fucking happened! i wanna know. i wanna know. i just wanna fucking...!}
<A>__{camera is kicked off and shuts down.}
