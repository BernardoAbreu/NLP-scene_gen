<L>__{interior mark's dark room night}
<A>__{helen closes the manuscript and lays it carefully by the side of the projector. she turns to leave then looks curiously at the projector. close shot of helen hesitating. like a small girl in front of her mother's make up box, she touches the projector tentatively, hesitates again, then presses a switch. a beam of light shoots out. we watch helen's face as she looks at the screen. nothing seems wrong for a few seconds then something starts to happen to the comers of her mouth... and then her eyes become locked... and cannot stop watching. some kind of sound comes from the back of her throat. her hands dig into the table and she tries to stand up. she cannot manage it the first time and keeps on watching, then, like a child waking from a nightmare, she jerks herself away from the table, and stumbles towards the door. close shot of mark standing there watching her. close shot of helen staring at him... again we hear that sound from the back of her throat. he looks away from her at once.}

<D>__{don't let me see you... frightened...}
<P>__{(he pushes the door wide open...)}

<D>__{now!}
<A>__{she stands with her back to him. from reverse angle we see her struggling for breath. over her shoulder we see him staring at the 16mm screen.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that film...}
<A>__{over her shoulder we see him hurry towards the projector.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that film...}

<C>__{helen}

<D>__{you'll be safe as long as i can't see you frightened so stand in the shadows, helen... please...}
<A>__{she stands motionless.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{... please...}
<A>__{from her pov we see him standing in front of the door, looking ahead of him. she backs slowly away into the shadows at the back of the room.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{she's right... your mother... must tell someone everything... sorry... has to be you!}
<A>__{close shot of helen standing in the shadows where her mother stood.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{this was his laboratory... and you know some of what he did... but not all.}
<A>__{the room is suddenly filled with the terrified screaming of a small boy. helen wheels round. the screaming seems to be coming from the walls. mark's hand is on a switch one of a number on a panel.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{... aged five...}
<A>__{he presses another switch. there is a click, and the screaming stops, to be replaced by a low sobbing.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{... aged seven...}
<A>__{he presses another switch. there is a moment's silence.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{all the rooms were wired for sound... and... still are.}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{your room.}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{your mother's .}

<C>__{helen}
<D>__{look at me, mark!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{not if you're frightened...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{look at me!}
<A>__{slowly he faces her.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what did you do... to those girls?}

<A>__{he turns to his cine camera, and picks it up. he releases the tripod. camera holds on helen. she stands very still against the wall. mark's voice is overlaid.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{do you know... what the most frightening thing in the world is?...}
<A>__{she is looking at something, puzzled.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it's fear.}
<A>__{the sound of his footsteps approaching...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{so i did something... very simple...}
<A>__{we see a look of fear spring into her eyes.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{very simple.}
<A>__{we see the spike approaching her throat... but she is looking at something else.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{when they felt the spike... touching their throats... and knew i was going to kill them...}
<A>__{the spike is touching her throat.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{... i made them watch their own deaths!}
<A>__{close shot of helen's face several times its natural size. she is looking at herself in a large circular magnifying mirror which has been fitted over the camera's face. the mirror entirely obscures both mark and the camera. there is a small hole in the mirror through which the lens of the camera winks. as helen looks at her terrified distorted face this small hole gives her an extra eye in the middle of her forehead.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{made them see their own terror as the spike went in... and if death has a face, they saw that too!}
<A>__{close shot of mark crouching behind the mirror, sweat pouring down his forehead... his finger on the trigger of the camera.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{not you! not you! i will never photograph you! i promised i promised not you!}
<A>__{helen's eyes are closed. the spike is still touching her throat. close shot of mark his face turned away from the viewfinder.}
