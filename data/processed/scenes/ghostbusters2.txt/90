<A>__{venkman and winston enter and find stantz and spengler at work in the lab area.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{oh good, you're here. spengler and i have something really amazing to show you.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(to spengler)}
<D>__{it's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?}
<A>__{stantz goes to the refrigerator, opens the freezer, rummages around among the tv dinners and frozen pizza and pulls out a slime specimen in a tupperware container.}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(to venkman)}
<D>__{we've been studying the stuff that we took from the subway tunnel.}
<A>__{he pops the specimen jar in the microwave and lets it thaw for a minute.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{and now you're going to eat it?}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{no, i'm just restoring it to its normal state.}
<A>__{he takes the specimen out of the microwave and pours some of it into a large petri dish.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{now watch this.}
<A>__{he leans over the specimen and starts shouting at it.}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(simulating anger)}
<D>__{you worthless piece of slime!!}
<P>__{(as the slime starts to twitch and glow)}
<D>__{you ignorant disgusting blob!!}
<B>__{specimen}
<A>__{it bubbles and swells, changing color with each insult.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{you foul, obnoxious muck!!}
<B>__{stantz}
<A>__{he continues venting his rage on the slime.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{i've seen some real crud in my time, but you're a chemical disgrace!!}
<A>__{the specimen doubles its size and starts spilling over the rim of the petri dish.}
<B>__{stantz and spengler}
<A>__{they turn to venkman for his reaction. he's dumbfounded.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{this is what you do with your spare time?}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(very excited)}
<D>__{this is an incredible breakthrough, venkman. a psychoreactive substance! whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{'mood slime.' we ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{we've found it at every event site we've been to lately.}
<C>__{winston}
<P>__{(poking at the slime)}
<D>__{you mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{like a goat on garbage.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{we're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{what kind of tests?}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(a little embarrassed)}
<D>__{well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things }
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{you're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?}
<A>__{spengler reacts as if he might be.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{it really responds to music.}
<P>__{(to spengler)}
<D>__{let's calm it down.}
<A>__{spengler picks up a guitar and he and stantz start singing "cumbaya" to the slime specimen.}
<B>__{specimen}
<A>__{it stops bubbling and starts to shrink.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{does it have any favorites?}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{it likes all the sappy stuff: 'cumbaya,' 'everything is beautiful,' 'it's a small world' but it loves jackie wilson.}
<A>__{venkman and winston watch intently as spengler spoons some of the psych reactive slime onto an old toaster.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{watch this.}
<A>__{stantz turns on a cassette player and jackie wilson's "higher and higher" blasts from the speakers.}
<B>__{toaster}
<A>__{it shakes, spins and actually starts moving in time with the music.}
<B>__{venkman}
<A>__{he stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces of toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{i don't care what you say. this could be a major christmas gift item.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{so we'll put a warning on the label.}
<A>__{stantz turns off the music and the toaster stops moving. venkman looks at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(to the toaster)}
<D>__{go ahead. i dare you.}
<A>__{suddenly, he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand and won't let go. the others jump in to help him, but venkman laughs and easily withdraws his hand.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{just kidding.}
