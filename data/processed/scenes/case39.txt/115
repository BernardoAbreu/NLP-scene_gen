<A>__{the head of a turning screw emily installing a deadbolt on her door in the middle of the night. it's the third lock, the other two already in place. hands trembling, she lines up the last screw. it slips from her fingers. rolls under the door. she cracks opens the door. reaches to grab it and lets out a shriek, recoiling feet standing just outside her door. lucy, in pajamas, holding the screw she hands it back to emily, making no overt acknowledgement of it.}

<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{she walks down the hallway to her bedroom. as soon as lucy's door closes, emily closes hers and goes back to work, doublespeed. winds that last screw into the wood and then slides to the heavy bolts.}
<B>__{clunk. clunk. clunk.}
<A>__{scooting backwards, she sits against the bed, wide eyed with terror, screwdriver clutched in her fist like a stabbing weapon.}
