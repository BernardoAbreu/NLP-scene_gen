<L>__{181. the great cabin, doldrums day}
<A>__{jack stands behind his desk, brow like thunder. from outside the sounds of the muster. hollom stands in front of him, twisting his hat between his hands.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the man pushed past you without making his obedience. and yet you said nothing.}
<C>__{hollom}
<D>__{no, sir, i intended to but the right words just didn't...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{'the right words'? he failed to salute you. it's deliberate insubordination.}
<A>__{hollom looks at the floor, mumbles }
<C>__{hollom}
<D>__{they don't like me, sir.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{they what? speak up, man!}
<A>__{hollom raises his head and looks at jack, his eyes shiny with tears and when he opens his mouth the words tumble out in a rush.}
<C>__{hollom}
<D>__{i've tried to get to know the men a bit, sir, be friendly like, but they've taken a set against me. always whispering when i go past, giving me looks. but, i will set that to rights, be tougher on them from now on.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you can't make 'friends' with the foremast jacks, they'll despise you in the end. nor do you need be a tyrant. it's leadership they want, strength, respect.}
<C>__{hollom}
<D>__{i'm very sorry, sir.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're what twenty three, twenty four?}
<C>__{hollom}
<P>__{(smiling weakly)}
<D>__{twenty five next friday.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you've failed to pass for lieutenant twice. you can't spend the rest of your life as a midshipman.}
<C>__{hollom}
<D>__{i will try harder, sir.}
<A>__{killick helps jack on with his full dress uniform.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, it's an unfortunate business, hollom. damned unfortunate.}
<A>__{killick seems to endorse this by placing the captain's hat emphatically on jack's head. jack turns and strides out of the cabin, hollom following slowly after him.}
