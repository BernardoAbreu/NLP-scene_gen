<A>__{a pov shot of daddy and rose, as seen by children. the table now is cleared and rose stands half behind daddy, staring down at him with a stricken expression.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(half to himself)}
<D>__{ehh, lord, should have bought that stock when we had some money. a thousand millionaires.}
<A>__{rose suddenly makes up her mind, places her hand on his shoulder, turns sideways, sits down on his lap, puts an arm around his neck.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{oh, oh! oh, mr. hillyer, i love you, i love you so much! i've tried, but i can't help it! please kiss me will you kiss me?}
<A>__{for a long time daddy stares groggily at her with a half frown as if he can't believe it. in order to stare at her, he must tilt his head back and, handsome man though he is, he looks a bit like a startled rooster. her breasts are pressed against him, and her eager pink lips are waiting for a kiss.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(finally clears his throat)}
<D>__{ahh hem! now, rose, get off my lap. what are you doing, girl? are you crazy?}
<C>__{rose}

<C>__{rose}
<D>__{no, no! you don't understand, i love you! it's real love and i can't help it! please kiss me, mr. hillyer, i love you, i love you so much...}
<A>__{rose breaks down and begins crying, her head on his shoulder. she has her arms wound tight around him and daddy seems at a loss what to do.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(in a shaken voice)}
<D>__{all right, all right. now calm down, rose, the children will hear you. calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{don't make me... me... me... get up!}

<D>__{calm down, rose, let's calm down and discuss it ...}
