<A>__{the wind howls through the distant trees as darkness falls. willow rocks the baby and eats some bread. madmartigan watches him hungrily, sighing, forlorn, his eyes asking for pit. willow glances at him. finally, he can't take any more and he puts down the baby and pous some goat's milk in a cup. he reaches up on tip toes and offers the milk to madmartigan.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{that's more like it.}
<A>__{madmartigan snatches the cup and guzzles the milk, retching horribly at the taste. then he tosses the cup back.}

<D>__{do any other daikinis ever come by here?}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{why.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i have to give this baby to some body.}
<A>__{madmartigan grabs the bars and raises himself up.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i'm somebody. lemme out and i will take care of your baby.}
<A>__{he makes little kissing noises to the baby, trying to be sweet. however, his teeth are filthy.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{no. somebdoy put you in there for a reason. i will wait for somebody else.}
<A>__{willow retreats to the fire. madmartigan whacks the cage with the back of his hand.}
