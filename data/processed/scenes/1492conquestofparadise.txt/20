<A>__{an el greco painting. a tableau of twenty men sitting on dark, sculpted seats. candles throw a gloomy light on their faces. some are churchmen, others are dressed in bourgeois outfits. only one of them is richly dressed in the grand spanish fashion he is sanchez, treasurer of the house of aragon. a monk (don arojaz) holds a stick with an ivory claw at the top. languidly, he scratches his back his off hand manner only makes him more impressive than his peers.}
<C>__{arojaz}
<D>__{you say asia can be found by sailing west?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{yes, your eminence. the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.}
<C>__{arojaz}
<D>__{unfortunately, don colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{are you familiar with the work of aristotle? erathostene? ptolemeus?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{i am, your eminence}
<C>__{arojaz}
<D>__{then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the earth is approximately...}
<P>__{(he leans forward)}
<D>__{22,000 leagues or more. which makes the ocean... uncrossable.}
<A>__{he leans back, satisfied, and pauses for effect.}
<C>__{arojaz}
<D>__{but you may have found new evidence proving that these men of knowledge are totally mistaken!}
<A>__{a ripple of mirthless laughter.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{your excellencies are aware of the statements of marin de tyr?}
<C>__{hernando de talavera}
<D>__{we are.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{then you are also aware that his theories contradict ptolemeus... de tyr believes the ocean to be only 750 leagues...}
<A>__{a murmur of protest spreads among the members of the commission. but columbus is determined to press his theories.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{the florentine toscanelli and the french cardinal pierre d'ailly both think that marin de tyr is accurate in his calculations. and therefore, that the ocean can be crossed.}
<A>__{indignant and amused murmurs. diego de deza raises his voice to quiet the assembly.}
<C>__{diego de deza}
<D>__{gentlemen, let us suppose marin de tyr is right...}
<P>__{(the laughter subsides)}
<D>__{are we here to examine this proposal or not?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{diego de deza}
<P>__{(to columbus)}
<D>__{in your opinion, how long would the voyage be?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{seven weeks. six, during the summer months.}
<A>__{the murmur increases.}
<C>__{arojaz}
<D>__{marin de tyr is wrong and has been corrected many times over the centuries by the finest geographers. your voyage, don colon, would take a year!}
<A>__{a man of simple bearing, that columbus identifies as being a seaman, interrupts.}
<C>__{vicuna}
<D>__{how would the crew survive without being able to land for fresh water? water is undrinkable after six weeks! you'd never be able to turn back!}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{we wouldn't have to turn back! we would find land at this point!}
<C>__{arojaz}
<D>__{senor colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew. i am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{excellency, you are right.}
<A>__{instantly, the protests stop.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{i am a seaman, not a scholar... but as a simple man craving for knowledge, i have read all the work of these renowned geographers and discovered that none of them could agree on the exact width of this ocean...}
<A>__{he pauses, and starts walking in front of the experts, as a lawyer before a grand jury.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{therefore, as a modest man, i wonder: who is right?}
<A>__{the experts listen. close on sanchez's face, impressed by the boldness.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{who is right? this question remains unanswered.}
<A>__{he walks and stops before talavera, and catches the look of sanchez, sitting just behind him.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{your eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter. and that is to make the journey.}
<P>__{(to the assembly, with passion)}
<D>__{i am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.}
<C>__{arojaz}
<D>__{your life, and that of others!}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{if they agree to follow me, yes.}
<C>__{sanchez }
<D>__{suppose you cross this ocean. suppose you reach asia. what would spain do there?}
<A>__{conscious of a friendlier voice, columbus sees the treasurer sanchez, an imposing man in his fifties.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{trade, your excellency. according to marco polo, the kingdom of china is one of the richest of the world. even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.}
<C>__{arojaz}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{is that all that interests you? gold?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{no. the portuguese have already discovered black skinned people. i, too, will find other populations and bring them to the word of god.}
<A>__{the monk smiles thinly.}
<C>__{arojaz}
<D>__{christopher christo ferens the bearer of the cross!}
<C>__{monk}
<P>__{(ironic)}
<D>__{and colon the one who populates!}
<A>__{another small rill of laughter.}
<C>__{arojaz}
<D>__{if god intended our proximity to asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{did he not choose a carpenter's son to reveal himself to the world?}
<A>__{a hum of interest. close on sanchez watching columbus intently, a hint of an admiring smile on his lips.}
<C>__{arojaz}
<D>__{so you consider yourself the chosen one?}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{arojaz}
<D>__{don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{blind faith is what i consider heresy!}
<A>__{the murmur turns to an audible gasp. arojaz gets to his feet and leans forward, threateningly, the flame of a candle only inches from his face. there is absolute silence. columbus meets the monk's gaze unflinchingly.}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{asia can be found to the west and i will prove it.}
<C>__{arojaz}
<D>__{if god wills it!}
