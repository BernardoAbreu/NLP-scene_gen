<L>__{interior the sleeping room.}
<A>__{we can see nancy drift from the initial stage, over the brink into deep sleep. her hair falls into her eyes; her face relaxes; her shoulders curl round her like comforters. the music deepens, and begins to hint at the tones of the nightmare theme.}
<L>__{interior control room. day.}
<A>__{dr king and marge watch the instruments' every move. one of the machines begins a slight chirping. king scans it, liking what he sees.}
<C>__{dr king}
<D>__{okay, she's started to dream.}
<A>__{he leans forward in his chair, like a pilot starting an instrument approach. marge thompson licks her dry lips, fighting a turn of nausea.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{how can you tell?}
<C>__{dr king}
<D>__{r.e.m.'s. rapid eye movements. the eyes follow the dream their movement picks up on this }
<A>__{he prods a dial with his pencil and scribbles the time on a note pad.}
<C>__{dr king }
<D>__{beta waves are slowing, too. she's dreaming, all right. a good one, too.}
<A>__{marge watches the tv monitor. it's in extra close on nancy's eyes and they're darting beneath the lids, reacting to events lost behind a skein of flesh and neurons. king points to a moving graph. a needle's begun waving lazily between plus and minus three. the doctor nods, assured.}
<C>__{dr king }
<D>__{typical dream parameter. a nightmare, now, would be plus or minus five or six; she's just around three point }
<A>__{he stops. outside, visible through the glass, nancy twists around. eyes still closed, she's nevertheless holding her head in the attitude of prey listening to the first faint sound of the predator's approach. marge looks from her daughter to the doctor, color draining from her face.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{what the hell's this? she awake or asleep?}
<A>__{the needle of the graph gives a jagged pitch up, plunges, then surges well above the eight mark. a strange music cue disonant and threatening, creeps in the nightmare theme slurred into awful minors and weird disonance. king stares at the gauge in disbelief, rapping his finger on its glass.}
<C>__{dr king}
<D>__{can't be. it never gets this high...}
<A>__{the needle swings even higher, benind.}
<C>__{dr king }
<D>__{jesus h. christ.}
<A>__{he's cut off by the high pitched keening of the girl, the sound cutting through the double thickness of the glass like a lasar. a warning beeper has begun, the instruments light up like a christmas tree and outside in the sleeping room, nancy is contorting as if shot through with a thousand volts. king knocks over his chair in his sprint for the door.}
