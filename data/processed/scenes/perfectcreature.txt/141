<A>__{silus, on a fire escape, in the shadows. gone are the clothes of the brotherhood, rather he is dressed as someone who does not want to be seen. cut to his pov. we see lilly's building. we see through the window, into her apartment; a beacon of warmth in the night. in lilly's bed we can see the baby, its hands happily making patterns before its eyes.}

<A>__{silus scans the apartment. he can see the lounge. jones is there with lilly. lilly is dressed to go out; to leave. jones and lilly hug. then jones picks up two suitcases and moves towards the door. silus watches as lilly moves into the bedroom and reaches down for the tiny baby, its tiny arms clasping onto her as she lifts it.}

<A>__{we see silus, closer, watching. cut to lilly, pausing, moving to the window of her apartment, staring out into the night, almost directly toward silus. she raises her hand, as if in a gesture of goodbye and then she leaves. cut to silus, close, nodding.}
