<A>__{nero's arms and legs get strapped in tight. go wide to reveal he's pinned to an interrogation table three guards. a klingon interrogator approaches; looms over nero, studying the romulan's face with clinical detachment...}
<C>__{klingon interrogator}
<P>__{(subtitled klingon)}
<D>__{i have come far to meet you. "the one who does not speak." ten years is a long time to maintain silence.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{perhaps you simply do not speak klingon, just as i do not speak romulan.}
<C>__{klingon interrogator }
<P>__{(english now)}
<D>__{but i assume we both speak the language of our common enemy.}
<A>__{(note: from now on, our non english speakers will speak english, unless otherwise noted.) he reveals a worn leather journal. opens it, flips through it almost casually... we see sketches of the jellyfish ship, pages of complicated math equations...}
<C>__{klingon interrogator }
<D>__{we found this book in your cell. cartography, mathematics what do these mean? this date here eleven years from now what happens then?}
<P>__{(holds up the fluorescent maps)}
<D>__{and why attempt to smuggle in maps of federation space?}
<A>__{nero's face betrays nothing; no fear, no doubt. cold as fucking ice. the interrogator happens to stare at a page in the book: a drawing of spock. he closes the book.}
<C>__{klingon interrogator }
<D>__{when you were captured we assumed you were a spy, sent from romulus to surveil the empire. but because the romulans deny your existence, i believe you are much more than that.}
<A>__{interrogator looks over to the guards, nods. a guard approaches with some kind of glass container; we hear something wet flip flopping around inside, but we can't see what it is.}
<C>__{klingon interrogator }
<D>__{your ship remains in orbit above us now. we've been asking for its secrets for too long. that is why i am here. we want to know how it works and i believe now, finally... you will tell us.}
<A>__{a guard uses tongs to pull out the most disgusting creature you've seen from the container: a slug with suckers and spikes, covered in a grimy muck it flip flops.}
<C>__{klingon interrogator }
<D>__{centaurian slugs. their native planet is in constant sunlight. as a result, there's nothing they hate more... than darkness.}
<A>__{a guard grabs nero's head and forces it back; the second pries his mouth open with his hands. another guard shoves the thing into nero's mouth nero keeps his eyes open furiously determined not to be broken as they force him to swallow it he doesn't scream as the wretched thing makes its way down his esophagus and into his stomach }
<C>__{klingon interrogator }
<D>__{they try to claw and bite their way out of any dark space they're in.}
<A>__{nero stares at the ceiling in horrifying internal pain but straining to block it out. push down on nero's wide, crazed eyes tighter as we slowly dissolve to see what he: 's seeing what's keeping him from losing his mind dreamlike, ethereal images of a woman her beautiful, smiling face she's romulan looking at us, eyes full of love and she turns and we see she's pregnant and as our music builds, we cut to:}
